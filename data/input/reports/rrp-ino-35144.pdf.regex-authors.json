In addition there will be \ntechnical assistance (TA) given to assist in the implementation of \nthe Program. \n \nRationale  An effective state audit function is key to an effective and well-\n  functioning accountability framework for parliaments, the executive, \nthe judiciary, and civil society.. As part of the overall control of public \nsector  management,  the  function  provides  an  independent, \nobjective,  and  professionally  conducted  assessment  on  the \nveracity, accuracy, credibility, and reliability of information on the \neconomy, effectiveness, and efficiency of government.  \n \nWhile Indonesia has had institutional arrangements for public sector \naudit  since  the  early  1940s  the  legal,  policy,  and  institutional \nframeworks have not significantly evolved to promote transparency \nand accountability. First, a weak legal framework exacerbates the \nlack  of  clarity  between  internal  and  external  audit  functions. \nSecond, the allocation of resources has not always been in line with \npolicy and legal mandates. Third, parliamentary oversight has been \ndeficient. Fourth, public awareness of the benefits of audit has been \nvery low, and fifth, capacity has been weak. Due to decentralization, \nthe enormous transfer of resources has necessitated strengthening \nthe regional audit institutions to effectively fulfill their internal control \nand audit functions. \n \nThe  STARSDP  will  support  selected  policy  interventions, \nadjustment measures, and critical investments that may otherwise \nbe  hampered  by  resistance  to  change  or  adversely  affected  by \nbudgetary constraints. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \n  Sector: Law: Economic Management and Public Policy \nThemes: Public Governance \n \n \nThe Sector Development Program \n \n  The  goal  of  the  STARDSP  is  to  enhance  governance,  and  the \n  efficiency,  economy,  and  effectiveness  of  public  sector  audit \nthrough strengthened audit institutions operating to internationally \naccepted standards. The objectives are (i) an improved policy and \nlegal framework for state audit institutions, (ii) a strengthened and \nefficiently  aligned  operating  framework  for  external  and  internal \naudit,  (iii)  enhanced  accountability  and  oversight  of  the  audit \nfunction  at  all  levels  of  government,  and  (iv)  increased  public \nawareness of the benefits of audit and what it can deliver. \n \n ", "      iii\nThe program loan of the STARSDP will facilitate critical reforms \naffecting the entire audit sector, while the project loan will support \nkey investments to enhance capacity building and strengthen sector \nmanagement  practices.  Through  these  measures,  the  Program \naims to help the Government achieve the milestones stipulated in \nthe Government\u2019s post-International Monetary Fund (IMF) reform \nagenda  as  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  2003  White  Paper, \nEconomic Policy Package, Pre and Post IMF. The medium-term \npolicy framework of the STARSDP is described in narrative terms in \nthe  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  5),  and  a  policy  matrix \n(Appendix  6)  outlines  the  specific  actions  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment.  \n \n  The STARSDP includes several salient features. It will catalyze an \nexisting Government public expenditure management (PEM) reform \nagenda by providing the required focus on the audit function. While \nsupport from ADB and other external funding agencies has been \ninstitution  specific  the  proposed  Program  takes  a  sector-wide \napproach to strengthen PEM. The reform agenda has resulted from \nan integrated consultative process involving all key stakeholders, \nsupported by a project preparatory technical assistance (TA). The \nagenda\u2019s overall design has benefited from an in-depth national \nsurvey done of regional audit capability in around 460 districts. The \nProgram will help rationalize the legal framework for State audit \nfunctions. The Program will support the reorganization of external \nand  internal  audit  institutions  and  help  ensure  allocation  of \nadequate resources based on their legal mandates. The Program \nwill support Indonesia in modernizing its audit standards in line with \ninternational  practices,  and  help  the  external  and  internal  audit \ninstitutions adopt a strategic and risk-based approach. The Program \nwill strengthen technical support to central and regional parliaments \nto carry out their oversight function, and promote public awareness \nof the State audit functions at the central and regional levels. \n \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nObjectives  The objectives of the program loan are to (i) strengthen the legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  public  sector  audit,  (ii)  initiate  the \nrealignment  of  national  auditing  resources  to  enable  audit \ninstitutions to fulfill their mandate, (iii) support measures to enhance \nthe  parliamentary  oversight  on  public  audit  institutions,  and  (iv) \nprovide strategies to increase public awareness of audit and audit \ninstitutions.  \n \n \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB support the STARSDP by providing a loan \nTerms  of $200 million from its ordinary capital resources. The Borrower will \n  be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will have an amortization \nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility.  \n \n ", "iv   \nProgram Monitoring  The Government, through a STARSDP coordinating unit, made up \nand Tranching  of  program  loan  monitoring  unit  (PLMU)  and  investment  loan \n  monitoring  unit  (ILMU)  members,  will  provide  a  coordination \nfunction with the units in the executing agencies (EAs). A project \nperformance monitoring system will be developed. \n \nActivities under the program component will be carried out over 42 \nmonths from January 2004 to June 2007.  The program loan will be \nreleased in two tranches. To obtain their release, the Government \nwill  be  required  to  carry  out  actions  specifically  identified  as \nconditions  for  tranche  release  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  to \ndemonstrate satisfactory progress in implementing other actions in \nthe policy matrix. The first tranche, $100 million, will be released \nupon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche,  $100  million,  is \nexpected to be released by June 2006. \n \nExecuting Agency and  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the EA of the program loan \nImplementation  through the PLMU. MOF will chair a program interagency steering \nArrangements  committee to coordinate the program loan activities. \n \nProcurement,  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of \nDisbursement, and  eligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \nCounterpart Funds  countries. Procurement of eligible items financed under the program \n  loan will be carried out in accordance with standard Government \nprocedures  or  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe Government will use the counterpart funds to be generated \nfrom the loan proceeds to finance the costs of implementing the \naudit reform package. \n \nThe Project Loan \n \nObjectives and Scope   The objectives of the project loan are to enhance the capability of \n  the  audit  institutions  by  building  upon  past  support,  and  by \nintroducing  techniques  and  approaches  that  will  allow  the \ninstitutions to operate effectively and efficiently and to incorporate \ninternational  best  practices.  Investment  support  is  expected  to \nresult in a strengthened external auditor able to effectively operate \nat the national level, and an enhanced internal audit function and \ninstitutions across central and regional governments. The Project \nwill  enhance  the  oversight  capability  of  central  and  regional \nparliaments as well as public awareness of the audit function. \n \nThe investment project comprises five main components:  \n \n(i)  project management; \n(ii)  introduction of new systems and practices for effective \nexternal audit;  \n(iii) institutional enhancement and repositioning through new \nregulatory structures and practices for effective internal \naudit covering, as applicable, the inspectorate generals \n(IGs), BAWASDAs, and BPKP;  \n ", "      v\n(iv) establishment of a formal and nonformal education and \ncertification program for internal auditors; and \n(v) introduction of new practices for parliamentary oversight \nof  public  sector  audit  covering  national  and  regional \nparliaments.  \n \nLoan Amount and  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nTerms  equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,680,000 to the Republic of \n  Indonesia from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and $5 million \nfrom a Government of the Netherlands cofinancing grant, as part of \nthe investment project under the STARSDP. The loan will have an \namortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s based ADF loan \nfacility, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan \nAgreement. \n \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $42.7  million  equivalent \n  (including taxes and duties $3.0 million equivalent), consisting of \n$11.5  million  (26.9%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  including  $0.63 \nmillion in interest during construction/project implementation.

For  each  project  component  and  subcomponent, \nimplementation  responsibilities  will  be  devolved  to  implementing \nagencies according to their mandates and capacities. \n \nProcurement,  The Project will provide consulting services, equipment, and block \nDisbursement, and  grants for scholarships and institutional upgrading. International and \nConsulting Services  domestic consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB and GOI. Procurement of goods and services \nfinanced under the ADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  for  project \ninstitutions will be fully financed by the Government, and will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n ", "vi   \nAn  imprest  account,  with  a  ceiling  of  $2.5  million,  will  be \nestablished, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, and with \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. \nThe imprest account will be used to finance eligible small project \nexpenditures. \n \nTime Frame  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  with  completion \nexpected by 31 December 2009. \n \nRisks and   Smooth sector development program implementation rests on the \nSafeguards  assumption that the Government will (i) maintain its commitment to \n  carry  out  the  reforms  at  the  anticipated  pace;  (ii)  provide \n  counterpart  funds  and  staff  on  time;  (iii)  ensure  transparent, \n  accessible, and reliable data for monitoring implementation of the \n  state  audit  reform  program;  and  (iv)  administer  the  loans  in  an \nefficient and coordinated manner. \n \nRisks such as delayed implementation of policy actions and Project \nactivities have been mitigated by a number of safeguards. Policy \nactions  within  the  Program  are  linked  with  interventions  of  the \nProject  and  other  ADB  operations.

ILMU support of \n  $3.7 million will enhance project monitoring and quality assurance \nreviews of investment loan activities. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \n(STARSDP), including (i) a program loan, (ii) a project loan, and (iii) proposed administration of \ntechnical assistance (TA) for program loan coordination and monitoring, and investment loan \nmonitoring and quality assurance.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n1.   Macroeconomic Context \n \n2.  Indonesia has reached a critical juncture in its transition from a centralized authoritarian \nstate to a decentralized democracy. The 2004 elections for the Parliament (DPR) and regional \nparliaments (DPRD) including the regional representative bodies, has proceeded smoothly. In \nJuly 2004, for the first time the country elected its President through direct vote, and a new \ngovernment was in place by October 2004. Democratization is gradually maturing and the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  is  now  keen  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  achieved,  and \nconsolidate the decentralization process so that benefits from democracy and decentralization \nare effectively shared by population at large.  \n \n3.  Decentralization  has  presented  a  completely  different  domestic  paradigm  for \nmacroeconomic  management  in  Indonesia.  The  growth  potential  of  the  country  is,  among \nothers, dependent on how regionalization impacts economic development. Under Laws 32 and \n33 of 2004,1 which underpin decentralization, all functions other than foreign policy, defense, \nsecurity, judiciary, monetary and fiscal matters, and religious affairs have been devolved to \nregional governments.2 Law 32 gives broad autonomy to the regions; with that authority goes \nresources. The regional share in government spending is soon likely to exceed 40%, a sharp \ncontrast with the average 15% in the 1990s. Much of the Government apparatus has been \ntransferred to the regional governments: 250 provincial offices of the central Government, 4,000 \nlocal offices, and more than 16,000 service facilities. The regional governments and legislatures \nare now responsible for a wide range of political, economic, and social development policies as \nwell as exercising fiduciary controls. Their success will directly affect the lives and well being of \nmore than 220 million citizens. This enormous transfer of resources and authority underscores \nthe need to strengthen regional governance and capacities to ensure optimal use of resources. \n \n4.  The  Government  is  determined  to  continue  sound  macroeconomic  policies  by \nintroducing measures, among others, to strengthen the fiduciary aspects of public expenditure \nmanagement (PEM). These measures are reflected in the medium-term planning document, \n(PROPENAS) 2000-2004. Consistent with this paper, the Government\u2019s 2003 White Paper, \nwhich consolidates an ambitious agenda to achieve high and sustainable growth,3 recognizes \nthe widespread concern about poor governance and weak fiduciary controls. The State Audit \nReform Sector Development Program (STARSDP) will support these measures. \n \n                                                 \n1  Law 32/2004 on Regional Autonomy was previously Law 22/1999 on Regional Government, and Law 33/2004 on \nFiscal Balance between the Central Government and the Regional Governments was previously Law 25/1999 on \nFiscal Balance between the Center and the Regions.  \n2  Regional government refers to provincial and district governments, which are either regencies or cities. \n3  The Presidential Instruction (Inpres No.5/2003) about the MOF paper, Economic Policy Package Pre and Post IMF \n(better known as the White Paper), was issued on 15 September 2003 as a presidential instruction (Inpres \nNo.5/2003) on 15 September 2003.  \n  ", "2 \n5.  The STARSDP is a major step in the long-term partnership between the Government \nand ADB. Building upon its collaboration experience, the STARSDP is an integral part of a \ncluster of programs being formulated by ADB to support aspects of budget formulation at \ndecentralized levels; strengthen intergovernmental fiscal relations; and the controls and checks \nrelated to budget execution, financial management, and public oversight. This Program is in part \nthe outcome of the intensive policy dialogue between ADB and the Government, which started \nin December 2002 and was maintained throughout the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA), and the STARSDP preparation missions.4 \n \n2.  Sector Description \n \n6.  Efficient and well-structured state audit institutions are integral to an effective and well-\nfunctioning accountability framework. As a critical check on public sector management, audit \nprovides an independent, objective, and professionally conducted assessment on the veracity, \naccuracy, credibility, and reliability of information. State auditing arrangements need an external \naudit  function  (reporting  to  the  legislature)  and  an  internal  audit  function  (reporting  to  the \nexecutive).  The  external  audit  function  ensures  full  accountability  to  the  citizens,  and  the \nexternal auditor of government is traditionally the country\u2019s supreme audit institution (SAI)5. The \ninternal audit function is integral to the internal control system under the executive and hence \ncomplements  and  facilitates  external  audit,  which  utilizes  its  findings.6  A  schematic  of  the \ninstitutional arrangement is shown in Figure 1.  \n \n7.  The  Audit  Board  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (BPK),  established  by  the  1945 \nConstitution,  is  the  external  auditor  and  Indonesia\u2019s  SAI.7.  Throughout  the  world,  modern \ngovernments depend on public accountability and rely heavily on their SAIs to ascertain that \npublic funds are spent judiciously; that public programs achieve their intended goals; and that \nareas of waste, fraud, and inefficiency are identified and eliminated. SAIs has become important \ntools of good government and powerful agents of change. Following decentralization, the 2003 \nconstitutional amendment stipulated BPK as the only external auditor of central and regional \ngovernments.8 \n \n8.  For internal audit, at the central level the IG in each ministry reports directly to the \nminister.9  At  the  regional  government  level,  regional  internal  audit  agencies  (BAWASDAs), \nformed  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  Laws  32  and  33,  report  to  the  respective  chief \nexecutive10. In addition, at the central level, there is also Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan \nPembangunan (BPKP), another internal audit institution established by Presidential Decree, and \nreporting directly to the President. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n9.  Public sector audit institutions require a number of key attributes to make the audit \nsector  efficient  and  effective.  These  include:  a  strong  legal  and  institutional  framework, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003. Preparing the Support to State Audit Reform Project. Manila (INO-TA 4107). \n5  SAIs are the highest level of public sector audit in a country, and their role is often prescribed in law and the \nconstitution. The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) guides them.  \n6  In particular, INTOSAI recommends that SAIs assess and, where reliable, use the work of internal audit. \n7  BPK is a member of INTOSAI and the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI).  \n8  On 9 November 2001, Indonesia enacted the Third Amendment to its 1945 Constitution. Article 23 of the Third \nAmendment refers to BPK as the external auditor of the Government. \n9  Most nondepartmental government agencies maintain an internal audit function, and each state-owned enterprise \nmaintains an internal audit unit.  \n10 Under a recent decree issued by the State Ministry of Administrative Reform the BAWASDAs have been given the \noption to change their name to Inspectorates in line with the central government ministries. (MenPAN decree \nB/2009/M.PAN/10/2004). \n ", "3 \nadequate capacity in the institutions commensurate with their mandate, an efficient allocation of \nresources  between  the  institutions,  effective  oversight  by  parliament  and  follow  up  by  the \nexecutive, and full transparency of the audit process and its outputs11. A fully developed, well-\nfunctioning  public  audit  system  has  strong  external  auditing  capability,  is  constitutionally \nauthorized to audit the accountability of all levels of government, and has equally strong internal \naudit capability complementing the external auditor\u2019s.  \n \n10.  While Indonesia has had experience with public sector auditing for several decades, the \nsystem suffers from a clear lack of accountability, as evident from issues surrounding the \nsubstance and quality of critical public sector institution audits. Domestically and internationally, \nIndonesia  is  regarded  as  burdened  with  widespread  corruption12  and\u2014notwithstanding \ndemocracy, growing transparency, and serious attempts to put together a firm accountability \nframework\u2014the impact of that accountability remains weak. Corruption occurs at all levels of \ngovernment, and is largely a symptom of the failure of accountability. Responsibility for this \nfailure partly rests with the public audit sector function, which has been unable to deliver on its \nmandate.  Weak  accountability  at  the  regional  audit  institution  level  severely  hampers  the \neffective implementation of decentralization. With a BPK that has weak capacity and limited \npresence, central departmental internal audit bodies (IGs) and regional internal audit bodies \n(BAWASDAs) that are generally weak, inexperienced regional executives and legislatures that \ncannot fulfill an oversight function, and the presence of another central government internal \nauditor (BPKP) with an overlapping mandate with the other internal audit institutions. Indonesia \nhas an audit sector that is costly, ill structured, ineffective, and inefficient. A sector analysis is in \nAppendix 1, and a problem-and-constraint matrix in Appendix 2.  \n \n11.  Unclear  Legal  and  Institutional  Framework.  Traditionally,  countries  have  a  law \nrecognizing the audit function as a core component of public expenditure accountability. The \nconstitution and other laws elaborate the institutional role and organization of the SAI as the \nexternal auditor of government. In Indonesia, the audit function has until recently been defined \nonly as part of an antiquated law concerning the overall PEM framework.13 For more than 30 \nyears, the legal and regulatory framework governing BPK\u2019s mandate and operations (Law 5/73) \nhas  remained  unchanged,  while  the  economic,  political,  and  social  environment  has  been \naltered  dramatically.  The  law  is  not  sufficiently  strong  for  BPK  to  operate  efficiently  and \neffectively in a decentralized environment (Appendix 1, Table A1.2).  \n \n12.  In  general,  executive  decrees  rather  than  laws  regulate  the  internal  audit  function. \nCountries traditionally have, at the central level, internal audit in each ministry reporting to the \nminister, and at the regional level, a regional internal audit reporting to the regional executive. A \nless common alternative at the central level seen in countries with centralized authoritarian \nregimes  is  an  internal  auditor  covering  all  ministries  and  reporting  directly  to  the  chief \nexecutive.14 In Indonesia, the institutional arrangement for internal audit is complex, as it has, at \nthe central level, the IG, which is an internal auditor in each central government ministry, as well \nas a BPKP, which is a centralized internal auditor outside a ministry but reporting directly to the \n                                                 \n11 These attributes are reflected in the Lima Declaration of Guidelines on Auditing Precepts, INTOSAI, IX INTOSAI \nCongress, Lima, Peru, October 1977. Derived from the Lima Declaration, the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) has, in cooperation with the European Commission, developed Public \nManagement System Baselines for Good Governance, which were used as the basis of the assessment in the TA. \n12  Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia released a national survey of corruption in December 2001: 75% \nof respondents felt corruption was very common in the public sector. In Transparency International\u2019s 2003 \ncorruption perception index, Indonesia ranked near the bottom alongside the most corrupt countries in the world. \n13 Indische Compatibilitie Weit, enacted in 1925. The clauses were elaborated in the instruction and regulation for the \nGeneral Court of Accounts 1933. \n14 Most countries have the ministerial version, though a few countries have centralized arrangements, such as \nArgentina and Mongolia. Countries do not normally have both.  \n ", "4 \nPresident, as chief executive. BPKP has a physical presence in almost every province. BPKP\u2019s \nrole has thus sometimes been misconstrued as an external as well as an internal auditor. BPKP \nwas the favored audit institution in the New Order administration, and a number of presidential \ndecrees assign BPKP mandates overlapping directly with those of BPK and other internal audit \nagencies.15 Under an authoritarian and centralized government, such a lack of clarity provided \ncontrol and flexibility to the central government, and allowed the audit process to be stalemated.  \n \n13.  Democratization and decentralization, however, have strengthened central ministries \nand given independence to regional governments, emphasizing the roles of the respective \ninternal audit institutions, IGs, and BAWASDAs, which now find their roles overlapping with \nthose of BPKP in their audit universe. Consistent with the decentralization process, recent \nregulations and decrees have significantly reduced BPKP\u2019s mandate to undertake central and \nregional audits (Appendix 1, Table A1.3). The central and regional governments therefore need \nto work together to clearly elucidate the institutional arrangement for internal audit, and stipulate \nfurther the mandates and responsibilities through the requisite regulations and decrees. BPKP \nclearly now needs a new role with an appropriate alignment of resources, particularly at the \nregional level, commensurate with its mandate. At the same time, the BAWASDAs and IGs \nneed  to  have  their  position,  structure,  and  responsibilities  clarified  through  decrees  and \nregulations across regional governments and central government departments, respectively. \nDoing so would allow for a clear institutional and regulatory framework for internal audit.  \n \n14.  Inadequate  Capacity,  and  Inefficient  Allocation  of  Resources  between  the \nInstitutions. Under the New Order, BPK was perceived a threat to the executive, and was \ndeprived  of  the  resources  commensurate  to  its  constitutional  and  legal  mandate. \nDemocratization  and  decentralization  have  expanded  BPK\u2019s  audit  mandate,  and  the  2001 \nConstitutional amendment requires BPK to have field presence in each province. The State \nFinance Law (Law 17/03), passed in March 2003, details the entities over which BPK has audit \njurisdiction. In all, about 10,000 auditable entities are spread across the country, including \nParliament, the Supreme Court, 70 Government departments and agencies, some 480 regional \ngovernments and as many regional parliaments, and approximately 8,500 central and regional \nstate-owned enterprises.16 Notwithstanding some direct help from external funding agencies, \nBPK has an insufficient number of qualified auditing staff, particularly those required to carry out \nthe various specialized audits now considered integral to effective auditing. BPK can audit only \n12% of the entities from its estimated audit universe and, in particular, only 30% of the regional \ngovernments.17 A weak BPK, particularly one with little regional presence, leaves the public \nsector  without  an  effective  external  auditor.  BPK  cannot  meet  the  State  Finances  Law \nrequirement  that,  by  2007,  the  financial  accountability  statements  of  some  480  regional \ngovernments have to be audited within 6 months of the end of the financial year. Given the \nsignificant resource transfers after decentralization, this weak fiduciary environment needs to be \naddressed urgently.  \n \n15.  The ability of the central and regional governments to manage their internal control \nsystems is severely hampered by weak and ineffective internal audit functions. This hinders the \nwork of the external auditor, which traditionally judges, and relies on, an effective internal audit \nfunction  to  reduce  the  extent  of  its  own  audit.  Under  the  New  Order,  BPKP  was  given \nsignificantly more resources compared to the IGs and BAWASDAs. \n                                                 \n15 The New Order refers to the administration under President Soeharto. \n16 BPK sources. \n17 BPK\u2019s own analysis as reflected in the project preparatory TA report. \n ", " \n \nFigure 1: Schematic Representation of the Audit Institutions in 2004\n \nMMPPRR\n((PPeeooppllee\u2019\u2019ss  AAsssseemmbbllyy))\nDDPPDD\nPPrreessiiddeenntt  \n((RReeggiioonnaall   DDPPRR BBPPKK\nSSuupprreemmee  CCoouurrtt AAnndd\nRReepprreesseennttaattiivvee   ((PPaarrlliiaammeenntt)) ((SSuupprreemmee  AAuuddiitt))\nVViiccee  PPrreessiiddeenntt\nAAsssseemmbbllyy))\nSSttaattee  MMiinniissttrryy  ffoorr   MMiinniissttrryy  ooff  HHoommee  \nAAddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee  RReeffoorrmm AAffffaaiirrss GGoovveerrnnoorr\nSSeeccrreettaarryy\nMMiinniisstteerr\nBBAAWWAASSDDAA\nBBPPKKPP LLLEEEiiinnnEEEcccEEEeeeccchhh   ccchhhUUUeeehhheeelllnnneeeooollloooiiilllnnntttooosssnnn   nnn111   111   111\nEEEEEEcccEEEccchhhEEEccchhheeeccchhheeelllhhhoooeeellleeeooonnnlllooolllnnn   ooo111nnn   nnn111   111   111 IInnssGGppeeeenncceettoorraarraallttee  \nBBuuppaattii//MMaayyoorr\nLLLEEEiiinnnEEEcccEEEeeeccchhh   ccchhhUUUeeehhheeelllnnneeeooollloooiiilllnnntttooosssnnn   nnn111   111   111\nSSeeccrreettaarryy\nCCeennttrraall BBAAWWAASSDDAA\nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt\nLLLEEEiiinnnEEEcccEEEeeeccchhh   ccchhhUUUeeehhheeelllnnneeeooollloooiiilllnnntttooosssnnn   nnn111   111   111\nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  BBoouunnddaarriieess\nRReeggiioonnaall\nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt\nGGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  BBoouunnddaarryy  \nBBAAWWAASSDDAA  ==  RReeggiioonnaall  IInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiittoorr;;  BBPPKK  ==  AAuuddiitt  BBooaarrdd  ooff  IInnddoonneessiiaa;;    BBPPKKPP  ==  CCeennttrraall  GGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  IInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiittoorr;;  MMPPRR  ==  PPeeooppllee\u2019\u2019ssAAsssseemmbbllyy;;\n5\nDDPPDD  ==  RReeggiioonnaall  RReepprreesseennttaattiivvee  AAsssseemmbbllyy;;  DDPPRR  ==  PPaarrlliiaammeenntt..\nAAAuuudddiiittt   iiinnnssstttiiitttuuutttiiiooonnnsss                                                   AAAuuudddiiittt   mmmaaannndddaaattteee                                                 AAAuuudddiiittt   rrreeepppooorrrtttiiinnnggg                                                         CCCooommmmmmaaannnddd                                                             CCCoooooorrrdddiiinnnaaatttiiiooonnn\n ", "6 \n16.  Given their role in reporting to the executive, independence is always a problem for the \nIGs and BAWASDAs; but the more significant challenge is the inability to carry out financial and \noperational  audits,  as  most  staff  members  do  not  have  an  educational  or  professional \nbackground in accounting or auditing (only 38% of BAWASDA staff even have a degree), and \nturnover of qualified staff is high. The IGs and BAWASDAS thus have difficulty demonstrating \ntheir relevance. Table A1.5 (Appendix 1) summarizes a comprehensive survey undertaken by \nthe TA of all the BAWASDAs, and clearly highlights capacity deficiencies in a number of areas. \nSimilar issues were highlighted for the IGs through a sample study of six IGs.  \n \n17.  In stark contrast to BPK and the IGs, BPKP has auditors who are more qualified (over \n65% have a degree) and able to carry out financial and specialized audits. Notwithstanding its \nreduced mandate, BPKP is still by far the best funded and equipped of all the audit institutions. \nBPKP has about 6,700 staff members in 25 provincial offices, including an overseas office in \nGermany, compared to BPK\u2019s 2,700 staff members in 7 regional offices. The fact that BPKP has \ncarried  out  some  audit  work  of  the  IGs  and  BAWASDAs  reflects  the  mismatch  between \nmandate and resources. More significant is that the BAWASDAs and IGs, given their increasing \nindependence, now consider the this method of undertaking audit work as suboptimal, as they \nperceive a clear conflict of interest given that BPKP reports to the central executive and they \nreport to the regional executive.  \n \n18.  In summary, while BPK, IGs, and BAWASDAs can be strengthened notwithstanding \nBPKP\u2019s  resources,  the  general  consensus  is  that  efficiency  within  the  public  sector  audit \nuniverse can be considerably enhanced by reallocating potentially redundant resources within \nthe Government internal audit institutions to those audit institutions, internal or external, that can \nbetter utilize them.18. However, given BPKP\u2019s 20-year existence, its size and geographical \nspread, such a transition should be gradual. \n \n19.  Ineffective Oversight by Parliament and Follow-up by the Executive. After an audit, \nthe executive should follow up on the external auditor\u2019s findings. This oversight function is \nnormally performed by Parliament and regional parliaments, which receive the audit reports \nfrom the SAI. At the central level, the Parliament (DPR) reviews BPK\u2019s reports. However, the \nmembers lack the specific background or training in financial management, and need technical \nsupport from a skilled secretariat similar to what prevails in other democracies. Studies indicate, \nhowever, that the Parliamentary secretariat staff has inadequate training, and needs to develop \na better client-service ethos with members.19 Usage of secretariat services by the Parliament is \nlow, dependency on short-term consulting support is great, and concerted measures to upgrade \nthe  supporting  infrastructure  are  lacking.  Consequently,  BPK\u2019s  reports  are  considered  as \ninformation only and are neither discussed nor followed up comprehensively. Parliamentary \nmembers point to the clear lack of experience and technical skills required to interpret the audit \nfindings that are often hidden in voluminous reports. At the regional level, the lack of oversight \nby regional parliaments (DPRDs) is of particular concern, exacerbated by the fact that regional \nparliaments and their members are new to their responsibilities under a decentralized and \ndemocratic system. However, they have received no guidelines or technical support either from \nBPK  or  from  a  qualified  secretariat  on  how  to  review  such  reports.  Although  oversight \nresponsibilities are difficult to impose on a politicized legislature, the secretariats should be \nbrought  up  to  international  standards  of  operations  so  they  can  provide  analytic  support. \nInteraction with BPK needs to be enhanced. \n                                                 \n18 The Country Financial Accountability Assessment 2001 recognized this issue. The assessment was supported by \nin-depth sector study undertaken by the ADB STAR project preparatory TA, where alternatives were presented for \nBPKP, and supported by the steering group of the project preparatory TA. Figure A1.1 (Appendix 1) shows the \nincreased cost of the audit sector. \n19 ADB\u2019s sector study (February 2004) highlighted DPR issues. The findings were confirmed in the AusAID and \nWorld Bank review (April 2004) in which ADB participated. \n ", "7 \n \n20.  Lack of Transparency and Accountability in the Audit Process. The public has a \ncritical role in ensuring accountability of the government and legislature.20 However, legislative \nand institutional barriers, together with the general lack of experience in transparency, have \nmeant that the public, including civil society, has limited understanding of the role of the various \naudit institutions, the information that audit can provide, and the benefits of an efficient and \neffective  audit  function.  Without  this  information,  the  public  cannot  demand  accountability. \nInternal audit reports from BPKP, IGs, and BAWASDA s are not normally made public, and \neven BPK until recently did not disclose its reports to the public. Transparency in the institutions\u2019 \noperations is weak. BPK has never been subject to an external audit and is going through its \nfirst peer review by the New Zealand Supreme Audit Institution.21 Internal audit has not been \nsubject to peer review, and international exposure of internal audit staff is limited.  \n \n1.  Government Strategy \n \n21.  The Government has a clear agenda to improve PEM\u2019s fiduciary aspects (para. 4). Even \nbefore the 2003 White Paper, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) established, in 2000, the Financial \nManagement Reform Committee to initiate and supervise a series of financial management \nreforms. The Government of Indonesia in 2001, introduced the state treasury, finance, and audit \nbills into Parliament, of which now have been enacted as Laws Given the long menu of items to \ntackle, the emphasis has primarily been on the issues covered by the state treasury and finance \nbills  rather  than  the  audit  function.  Because  of  the  considerable  support  provided  by  the \nSTARSDP project preparatory TA, and after substantial amendments to the original draft, the \nState Audit Law was recently approved.22 Other support to the audit institutions has been \nselective. BPK\u2019s budget has been increased, BPKP\u2019s mandate has been diminished through \nother laws and regulations, and Parliament is now considering a revised BPK law (Appendix 1). \nHowever, this has been in the absence of an overall framework or long-term vision, thus \nimpacting on the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the audit sector. The STARSDP \nbrings in a comprehensive program that addresses these concerns.  \n \n22.  Studies  such  as  the  joint  ADB\u2013World  Bank  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability \nAssessment  and  the  ADB  Country  Governance  Assessment  have  highlighted  the  poor \ncapability of the audit sector. However, external assistance to the audit sector has been modest, \nintermittent, and directed to capacity building in individual institutions of the central Government \nin the absence of a policy framework to deal with a decentralized Indonesia. BAWASDAs have \nbeen given virtually no support. A summary of support by the international community to the \naudit sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n2.  Lessons Learned  \n \n23.  Given  the  scarce  number  of  projects  directly  focused  on  the  audit  sector,  lessons \nlearned have been drawn from a broad perspective of experiences in public sector management \nprojects and from decentralization initiatives. The STARSDP\u2019s design has benefited from the \nlessons learned:  \n \n(i)  Government commitment and the pace of reform. The Government\u2019s political \ncommitment  is  critical  for  comprehensive  reforms  but,  in  a  country  that  has \ndemocratized and decentralized almost simultaneously, the commitment must be \nconsistent with the pace of reforms. \n                                                 \n20 Asia Foundation. 2003. Indonesia Rapid Decentralization Appraisal, Third Report. Jakarta. \n21 This is an exercise supported by the World Bank under its Audit Modernization Project for BPK. \n22  The State Audit Law was approved on 19 June 2003. \n ", "8 \n \n(ii)  Holistic  approach  to  the  sector.  Effective  audit  sector  reform  requires  a \nfocused,  holistic  approach  to  the  whole  sector,  rather  than  relying  on  the \nmarginal impact of strengthening individual institutions, which excludes a legal \nand institutional framework, interdependence of the institutions, the important \nrole of oversight, and public participation. In a decentralized environment, focus \nshould not be just on the central Government if a sustainable reform agenda is to \nbe properly defined. Regional governments need to be included as well. \n \n(iii)  Complementarity  with  other  initiatives.  Reforms  in  an  area  like  financial \nmanagement  in  general  and  audit  in  particular  should  complement  other \ninitiatives.  In  Indonesia,  which  has  adopted  commendable  but  hastily \nimplemented decentralization reforms, strengthening systems for the planning \nand budgeting and then also the accountability of expenditure need to go hand in \nhand to improve local governance. \n \n(iv)  Proper sequencing. Generating a sound sequence of reform measures is as \ncritical  as  the  reforms  themselves,  particularly  where  capacity  is  weak  and \nresources limited. Legal and regulatory reforms ought to precede institutional \nchange, which has to happen before results are achieved. In the absence of a \nproper sequencing of reforms, particularly in financial management, audit and \nother public institutions have not been able to function efficiently.  \n \n(v)  Complexity of a reform program. Given weak capacity to implement program \ninitiatives,  the  complexity  of  programs  needs  to  be  thoroughly  examined  to \nensure that deliverables can be met. \n \n(vi)  Role  of  the  public.  In  emerging  economies,  public  sector  accountability  is \nconstrained by weak capacity of oversight institutions and lack of awareness of \nthe public of the role of government institutions such as the audit institutions. \nComing out of a centralized and an authoritarian regime, the Parliament and \nother public sector institutions are only now beginning to become transparent and \naccountable. \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n24.  The goal of the STARSDP is to enhance governance, and the efficiency, economy, and \neffectiveness of public sector audit function through strengthened audit institutions operating to \ninternationally generally accepted standards. The STARSDP pulls together various existing \ninitiatives,  together  with  new  ones,  to  catalyze  the  Government\u2019s  PEM  reform  agenda \nholistically. Appendix 4 summarizes the STARSDP logical framework. \n \n25.  The STARSDP establishes the foundations for a strong audit sector through a mixture of \npolicy and capacity-building initiatives. To leverage these reforms, the combination of policy-\nbased and investment-lending support is considered appropriate and timely at the present stage \nof public expenditure reform. The STARSDP aims to support the strong commitment of the \nGovernment to accelerate policy and institutional changes in public sector audit functions; the \nhigh adjustment costs of, and compensatory measures for, reforms; and the high level of \ninvestments required to improve audit quality and expand audit coverage \n \n ", "9 \n26.  Program Loan. The objectives of the program loan are to  (i) improve the policy and \nlegal framework for state audit institutions, (ii) strengthen external and internal audit functions by \nproviding adequate resources to institutions in line with their legal mandate, (iii) put in the policy \nmeasures  to  enhance  accountability  and  oversight  of  the  audit  function  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment, and (iv) put in strategies to increase public awareness of the benefits of a well-\nfunctioning state audit system and what it can deliver. The implementation of actions under the \npolicy matrix will be carefully phased, reflecting the preferred gradual approach to change, and \nacknowledging the constraints and risks associated with implementing adjustment measures. \nThe medium-term policy framework is in the development policy letter (Appendix 5), and the \nrelated set of policy actions are listed in the policy matrix (Appendix 6).  \n \n27.  Investment Loan. The objectives of the project loan are to enhance the capability of the \naudit institutions by building upon past support and by introducing techniques and approaches \nthat will allow the institutions to meet their immediate mandates by operating effectively and \nefficiently, and incorporating international best practices. Investment support is expected to; \nbuild a strong external auditor able to effectively operate at the national level, enhance the \ncapability of the internal audit function and institutions, enhance the oversight capability of \ncentral and regional parliaments, and increase the public awareness of the audit function. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n28.  Ownership and Stakeholder Consensus on the STARSDP. The STARSDP reform \nagenda  was  formulated  in  partnership  with  an  interagency  steering  committee  chaired  by \nBAPPENAS,  which  included  key  central  Government  departments  such  as  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and BAPPENAS, all the central and \nregional audit institutions as well as parliamentary secretariat staff. A key feature of ADB\u2019s \nsupport was that at the start of the TA four fundamental principles were agreed upon by the \nsteering  committee,  as  criteria  for  resolving  some  contentious  audit  issues:  (i)  a  clear \ndelineation between internal and external audit institutions and functions, (ii) recognition and \nrespect for the decentralization process, (iii) elimination of overlap in the mandates of the public \nsector audit institutions, and (iv) achievement of overall cost-efficiency. The ability to address \nreform issues can be credited to the upfront consensus on the above principles. \n \n29.  Consensus-building activities included not only the Government but also the other aid \nagencies. The STARSDP\u2019s policy dialogue helped evolve, early on in the project preparatory \nTA, a common vision, amongst all stakeholders, on the policy agenda, and a focus of the \ncapacity building issues. The holistic approach was extensively discussed as a part of the \ncoordination with external funding agencies, and a number of these agencies have shown \ninterest in cofinancing the capacity-building measures, particularly at the decentralized level.  \n \n30.  Modality  of  Assistance.  The  STARSDP  introduces  a  new  approach  to  the  sound \ndevelopment of the audit function by advocating the simultaneous packaging of policy reforms \nand the investment component, initially on a pilot basis to assess their efficacy, and then \nmodified before promulgation. Wherever possible, on issues such as audit standards, a national \nperspective is taken without allowing for regional versions; in areas such as the local regulations \nfor  internal  audit,  national  consistency  is  supported,  with  some  limited  regional  flexibility, \neconomies of scale are encouraged through the use of umbrella procurement contracts; and \ncapacity-building activities are tailored to institutional development plans, so that the specific \nneeds of the institutions can be supported.  \n \n31.  Public Accountability of the Audit System. The Program recognizes clearly that the \nsustainability of the reform agenda depends on the close interrelationship between demand and \nsupply on the audit sector\u2019s outputs. While the audit sector institutions can be provided with an \n ", "10 \nadequate legal and institutional framework, and capacity to deliver, the accountability framework \nrequires other partners such as parliamentary bodies, the executive, the judiciary, and, most \nimportant, the public, to be equally effective players. The key beneficiaries must be in a position \nto  appreciate  any  deficiencies,  demand  appropriate  action,  and  further  refine  the \nresponsiveness of the sector to society\u2019s needs. This forms the basis of a solid partnership that \ncan allow institutions to develop together and respond to each other\u2019s changing requirements.  \n \n32.  Selection Criteria for Regional Governments. The following principles will be used to \nselect regional governments for capacity building support: (i) selectivity and open competition, to \nensure that districts committed to good governance are chosen; based on specific actions \nundertaken  (ii)  strong  support  from  the  heads  of  the  regions  and  the  Bawasdas,  as \ndemonstrated through the submission of a letter of interest expressing the region\u2019s interest to \nparticipate in the Program; (iii) lack of adequate human resource and infrastructure capacity to \nconduct effective audit \n \n33.  Public-Private  Partnership  Development  for  Public  Sector  Audit.  Public-private \nsector  partnerships  are  encouraged  where  appropriate  and  mutually  beneficial.  They  will \nenhance  quality  assurance  by  exposing  public  sector  institutions  to  the  latest  auditing \ntechniques, and allow the sector to increase its qualified auditing personnel. Partnerships will \nencourage private sector firms to compete for audit work as well as build the firms\u2019 capacity.  \n \nC.  The Program Loan  \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \n34.  The program loan will involve the following: (i) rationalization of the policy, legal, and \nregulatory framework for state audit institutions; (ii) alignment and provision of resources to \nenable  audit  institutions  to  fulfill  their  mandate;  (iii)  enhanced  oversight  of  audit \nrecommendations  and  of  the  central  and  regional  audit  function;  (iv)  and  enhanced \ntransparency and public awareness of the central and regional state audit function.  \n \n35.  Key outputs of the program loan are (i) submissions of audit laws that will define the role \nof  audit  in  public  sector  financial  management,  and  the  organization  and  structure  of  the \nexternal  auditor;  (ii)  submissions  of  draft  central  and  regional  government  regulations  and \npresidential decrees to reorganize internal audit institutions; (iii) realignment and efficiency in \nbudgetary resource use; (iv) a BPK regulation on adopting international auditing standards; (v) \nregulation on certification for internal auditors based on international standards; (vi) a clear \nvision statement for BPK as the SAI; (vii) Parliament and regional parliament (DPR and DPRDs) \naction plans to strengthen technical support to central and regional parliaments to carry out their \noversight function; and (viii) the adoption of a public awareness strategy for audit at central and \nregional levels.  \n \na.  Rationalization of the Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks for \nState Audit Institutions \n \n36.  Strengthening  Regulatory  Framework  for  External  Audit.  As  part  of  the \nmodernization of the legal framework for PEM, the Government in 2000 introduced bills on state \nfinance, treasury, and audit to replace the century-old Dutch colonial laws. At the same time, \nfollowing the 2002 constitutional amendment that expanded BPK\u2019s role, Parliament, through its \nCommission IX, reviewed and revised the BPK Law (Law 5/73) to clarify BPK\u2019s roles and \n ", "11 \nresponsibilities  and  take  into  account  the  impact  of  decentralization23.  The  TA  identified \ndeficiencies in the state audit and the BPK bills, and has underscored with the Government and \nBPK  that  these  laws  need  to  be  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  As  part  of  the \nSTARSDP, the Government submitted amendments to the earlier draft state audit bill in early \n2004. The State Audit Law was recently approved on 19 June 2004, and enacted in July 2004.  \n \n37.  Under  the  Program,  BPK  will  submit,  through  the  Government,  to  Parliament \namendments to the draft BPK bill. The agreed amendments were discussed in detail with the \nproject preparatory TA team, which provided inputs based on international best practice. Among \nothers, these amendments relate to the scope of BPK\u2019s authority; use of auditing standards that \nare compatible and reconcilable to international standards; indemnity from court actions of SAI \nstaff  to  include  all  relevant  SAI  staff;  minimum  relevant  qualification  criteria  for  Board \ncandidates, appointment of Board members by Parliament; and length of tenure of  the Board or \nBoard members that should not end coinciding with an election year. To settle any duplication or \noverlaps in the mandates, BPK will review clauses in existing laws, regulations, and decrees \nconcerning the audit function and will submit to Parliament and the Government a report on \ninconsistencies and conflicts with the state audit and proposed BPK laws. After these issues are \nresolved,  the  Government  will  review  this  report  as  the  basis  for  nullifying  the  conflicting \nclauses.  \n \n38.  Strengthen  Internal  Control  Systems,  including  Realignment  of  Internal  Audit \nInstitutions. Consistent with the Treasury Law, the Government will establish the institutional \nframework  for  internal  audit,  and  clarify  the  position  of  the  IGs  and  BAWASDA  s.  An \ninterministerial committee (IMC), made up of representative branches of the Government, will \nbe established to review the internal control systems and review and clarify the role of the \ninternal audit institutions. The IMC will review the role of all internal audit institutions to avoid \noverlap and increase cost-efficiency, focusing on the more effective internal audit function in the \nregional level and, in parallel, the need to expand BPK\u2019s physical presence in the regions. The \nIMC  will  draft  a  Government  regulation  on  internal  control  systems,  and  recommend  a \npresidential decree on aspects of the internal control systems, including the role of internal audit \ninstitutions. An institutional development plan (IDP) will be developed for the restructured BPKP, \nto define its new role. Resources may be redeployed to other audit institutions, particularly BPK \nregional offices.  \n \n39.  To enhance the role of IGs and to mainstream the internal audit function into ministry or \ndepartment operations, an MOF circular will be promulgated for all line ministries to ensure that \nall IGs review the annual statements of accountability produced by the departments. As a first \nstep  to  improve  aid  effectiveness,  the  MOF-IG  will  review  all  annual  and  midterm  project \naccountability statements of ADB projects.24 The IG reports on ADB projects will be submitted to \nBPK and ADB. Along the same lines and consistent with the State Finances Law, MOF will \nadopt  an  IDP  for  effective  internal  financial  management,  including  clear  definition  of  the \nposition of chief financial officer. This IDP is to be drafted as a model for other line ministries to \nadopt.  \n \n                                                 \n23 New laws can be originated either by the Government or by the legislature. All laws are passed by consensus \nbetween the two after discussion. The state audit bill was an initiative of MOF, whereas the BPK bill was initiated in \nParliament, with the support of BPK. Commission IX is one of several parliamentary committees established for \noversight of and communication with government agencies. The portfolio of agencies reviewed by the commission \nincludes, among others, BPKP, MOF, and BAPPENAS. Commission IX and BPK have a formal process of \ncommunication based on a written agreement \n24 Once the results of the ADB project audit reviews by the IGs are shared, other members of the lending community \nare expected to want their projects audited similarly. \n ", "12 \n40.  The central Government will, through MOHA, help local governments clarify the roles \nand responsibilities of the BAWASDA s. In addition, MOF will undertake a similar activity with \nrespect to the local chief financial officer. The chief financial officer is responsible for producing \nthe accountability statements of the regional government for BPK to audit, and is thus an \nimportant  part  of  the  internal  control  systems.  To  ensure  national  consistency  in  these \nstandards, MOHA will establish an intergovernmental team to draft model regional regulations \n(Perda or SK) to be adopted by the BAWASDAs. The regulations will, amongst others, require \nBAWASDAs to review regional governments\u2019 accountability statements. The team will include \nrepresentatives from the BAWASDAs, academia, professional audit bodies, and BPK. MOHA \nwill  disseminate  the  draft  nationwide  as  the  basis  for  formal  adoption  by  the  regional \ngovernments, and will track its adoption. About 50 regional governments will be targeted, based \non selection criteria (Appendix 14) that allow for selectivity and competition among regional \ngovernments willing to be part of the reform program.  \n \n41.  Public Sector Standards on Auditing and Certification Established. The STARSDP \npromotes the establishment of external  and internal public sector auditing standards. BPK has \ntraditionally  tried  to  follow  INTOSAI  standards  whereas  internal  audit,  through  BPKP,  has \nfollowed,  at  varying  times,  the  United  States  General  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  and  the \nAustralian Auditing Standards. Under the Program, external audit standards drafted by the SAI \n(BPK),  and  consistent  with  international  standards  will  be  introduced.  BPK  will  take \nresponsibility for this exercise by involving representatives from the government, professional \naudit organizations, and academia to establish these standards. BPK will replace the existing \nstandards through a BPK Board resolution. The internal audit standards will be introduced \nthrough the IMC draft regulation on internal control systems.  \n \n42.  MOF-IG will coordinate with selected IGs, BKN, BPKP, BPK officials and BAWASDAs to \n(a) review the recommendations of the IMC concerning the certification procedures of internal \nauditors and (b) draft the necessary revisions or a new Presidential decree which adopts the \nrecommendations regarding certification of internal auditors25 and submit the draft to the State \nSecretariat.  \n \nb.  Alignment and Provision of Resources to Enable Audit Institutions \nto Fulfill their Mandate  \n \n43.  The  STARSDP  emphasizes  the  need  for  the  efficient  use  of  national  resources \ndedicated  to  audit,  consistent  with  the  mandates  of  the  various  audit  institutions  and  the \nsupportive rules and regulations. The efficient allocation of resources requires effective planning \nand prioritization. Given BPK\u2019s mandate to audit several thousand institutions and government \nprograms at the central and regional levels of government, an institutional development plan \n(IDP) will be developed. The plan will clearly define BPK\u2019s audit universe. This plan will be made \npublic and thus form the basis of BPK\u2019s annual budget submission and its resource allocation. \nBPK needs to take a risk-based approach in deciding which entities must be audited every year, \nwhich audited by outside firms, and which audited only periodically. This will strengthen BPK\u2019s \nbasis for annual budget allocation irrespective of changes in the administration. MOF has \nagreed  to  support  and  act  upon  the  annual  budgetary  allocation  to  reflect  and  effect  the \nnecessary changes. Of particular importance are the extra-budgetary resources required for \nBPK to expand its presence in the regions. BPK will incorporate the findings of the IMC on \ninternal control systems and, as an interim measure, will request supplementary funding to be \nable to carry out the 2006 deadline audit of all regional governments. As part of BPK\u2019s long-term \n                                                 \n25  This will give certification authority to a body outside the internal audit function as decided by the IMC, with the \ncertification to be in line with international certification standards such as those provided by the Institute of Internal \nAuditors. \n ", "13 \nquality  assurance  program,  to  ensure  cost-efficiency,  and  to  encourage  public  private \npartnerships, BPK has agreed that a percentage of its audit work should regularly be carried out \nby private sector auditing firms. A BPK regulation will be passed to enable such contracting out.  \n \n44.  The Program will review the effectiveness and relevance of the financial management \ntraining at the various training centers.26 MOF will establish a team of relevant stakeholders to \nreview the existing training, of financial management and auditing staff for the public sector. \nThis assessment will identify measures to improve the effectiveness and relevance of the \nvarious programs, and the opportunities for economies of scale in the use of the physical \nassets.  \n \nc.  Enhanced  Oversight  on  Audit  Recommendations,  and  Increased \nAccountability of the Audit Function Nationwide.  \n \n45.  The STARSDP supports strengthening of oversight of audit institutions in a number of \nways. For the external audit function, a Parliament secretariat committee will be established in \nthe DPR, comprising the elected DPR members (where possible), members of the secretariat, \nand BPK staff members. The committee will review the capabilities of the secretariat, the \ninteraction with parliamentary members and BPK, and the follow-up on BPK\u2019s audit reports. \nBased on the review, DPR will prepare and adopt an action plan, which the ADB project \ninvestment component will support. The long-term aim is to foster a closer working relationship \nbetween the secretariat, members of parliament, and BPK. The audit committee will be a \npossible precursor to a public accounts committee, which exists in other democracies. BPK will \nharness the benefits of information technology (IT) to give the DPR access to a select part of \nBPK\u2019s management information system that contains the BPK reports and the follow-up actions. \nRegionally, the MOHA-IG will initiate a similar DPRD secretariat committee in 50 selected \nregional governments (para. 40) made up of BPK, and members of the executive. The action \nplan adopted will be the basis of further ADB\u2019s investment support.  \n \n46.  Under the Program, BPK will be subject to an annual financial audit. An operational \nreview, by a Parliament-appointed external SAI, will be conducted every 5 years. BPK will audit \ninternal audit institutions as part of its normal audit function, and will periodically review internal \naudit at the central and regional levels. An overseas IG performing a similar function, with a \nreport issued to the finance minister, BPK, and ADB, will also undertake a peer review of the \nMOF-IG. This is to be the basis of similar peer reviews by other ministries. The MOHA-IG will \norganize a peer review of selected regional governments.  \n \nd.  Enhanced Transparency and Public Awareness of the State Audit \nFunction at the Central and Regional Levels  \n \n47.  The audit sector will remain relevant to public sector accountability only through public \ninterest and involvement. The community needs to understand the audit function and to work in \na partnership to ensure that the follow-up actions occur. The community is a rich source of \ninformation  on  issues  such  as  corruption.  Under  the  Program,  BPK  will  develop  a  model \nprogram for public awareness, with inputs provided from academics, private sector, media, \nNGOs, and professional accounting associations. The primary objective will be to enhance \npublic awareness of the roles and responsibilities of the public sector audit institutions and to \nunderstand the audit reports issued. This model program will be the basis of further action to \ntrial with 50 selected regional administrations (para. 40) a public awareness campaign on the \nrole of external and internal audit using BPK\u2019s model program.  \n \n                                                 \n26 Sekolah Tinggi Akutansi Negara, a college of state accounting, BPK, BPKP, and IGs.  \n ", "14 \n48.  BPK will seek expert assistance to design a format for \u201cpublic-friendly\u201d reports that \nclearly identify the issues, and the follow-up actions required. These formats will be tested on a \npilot basis through newspapers in selected regions for a range of reports. Public hearings will \nobtain feedback from, among others, individuals, the private sector, NGOs, and the media. Pilot \nresults will be published on the BPK Web site and submitted to DPR, DPRDs, selected NGOs, \nand the media.  \n \n49.  To obtain feedback on the audit sector, the BPK board will fund a series of annual \nsurveys to assess the public\u2019s understanding of the public sector audit role. The reports will be \nsubmitted to DPR and DPRDs and published on the BPK Web site with the first survey results \npublished in December 2005. These will establish the baseline for future surveys.  \n \n2.  Financing Plan \n \n50.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  state  audit  reform  program  by \nproviding a loan of $200 million from its ordinary capital resources. The Borrower will be the \nRepublic of Indonesia. The loan will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \nThe loan is expected to be utilized over 3 years and will be disbursed in two tranches of $100 \nmillion each.  \n \n51.  Factors considered in determining the amount of the program loan are (i) the magnitude \nof  the  audit  sector  (in  public  spending  and  number  of  civil  servants)  and  the  impact  of \ndecentralization;  (ii)  the  scope  and  strength  of  the  reform  package  in  the  audit  sector, \nparticularly the acceleration of reforms in the past few years; and (iii) the estimated short- and \nmedium-term adjustment costs of the reforms.  \n \n52.  The loan amount is in line with the adjustment costs of the measures included in the \npolicy matrix during the program period and not yet initiated by the Government. The breakdown \nof the estimated adjustment costs of the principal policy measures comprises BPK\u2019s regional \nexpansion from 7 to 33 provinces ($105.1 million); salary increases, allowances, and incentive \nschemes for reallocation of staff between institutions ($33.7 million); provision for the use of \nexternal auditors as an interim measure ($40.3 million); adoption and enforcement of national \nauditing standards ($10.3 million); establishment of regional networks ($5.0 million); national \ncertification for internal auditors ($6.5 million); rationalization costs for the various audit training \ninstitutions  ($18.5  million);  and  nationwide  dissemination  of  draft  local  regulations  ($15.0 \nmillion).  The  Government  is  anticipated  to  incur  significant  additional  costs  for  leveraging \nreforms, including passage of laws and regulations, research, studies, and consultations related \nto the legal and institutional restructuring, audit quality monitoring, and audit report evaluation.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n53.  Program Management. MOF will be the Executing Agency of the program loan. MOF \nwill initiate withdrawals under the loan, and allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds. A \nprogram loan-monitoring unit (PLMU) will be established in the Directorate of Information and \nAccounting in MOF. This directorate will establish an interagency steering committee (ISC) \nmade up of echelon-1 staff members from each component implementing unit to oversee the \nimplementation of the program components and to facilitate interagency coordination. The ISC \nwill  comprise  representatives  of  BPK,  DPR  secretariat,  MOHA,  BPKP,  and  MenPAN.  The \nSTARSDP coordination unit, established by MOF and BAPPENAS, will coordinate between the \nPLMU and ILMU. The overall STARSDP management structure is depicted in Appendix 7.  \n ", "15 \n \n54.  Procurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \nexchange costs of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries. The loan will \nnot finance items specified in Appendix 8, or imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. Disbursement of loan proceeds will be permitted based on a certification provided by \nthe Borrower. Procurement of eligible items financed under the program loan will be carried out \nin accordance with standard public sector procedures of the Government or normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard  disbursement  procedures.  Before  submitting  the  first \napplication to ADB for withdrawal from the loan account, the Borrower will open a deposit \naccount at Bank Indonesia or another bank acceptable to ADB, into which all withdrawals from \nthe loan account will be deposited.  \n \n55.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  Throughout  implementation,  the  ISC,  STARSDP \ncoordinating unit, and PLMU will monitor quarterly the implementation of policy and institutional \nreforms envisaged under the STARSDP. In cooperation with the PLMU, ADB will carry out \nsemiannual review missions to assess implementation of the policy agenda and discuss major \npolicy developments with the ISC and concerned agencies. Such missions will be fielded to \nassess whether conditions for the release of the second loan tranche have been fulfilled.  \n \n56.  The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness, expected in December 2004. \nThe second tranche is expected to be released by June 2006 (or about 18 months after the first \ntranche). To obtain the release of the loan tranches, the Government will be required to carry \nout actions identified in the policy matrix as conditions for tranche release, and to demonstrate \nsatisfactory progress in implementing other actions listed and in the overall Program.   \n \n57.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. Separate accounts and records with respect to \nthe  deposit  account  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  consistently  maintained  sound \naccounting principles. Upon ADB\u2019s request, the Borrower will have the deposit account audited \nby independent auditors in accordance with appropriate auditing standards. Promptly after their \npreparation, certified copies of such audited accounts and records will be furnished to ADB.  \n \n58.  The Government will use the counterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds to \nfinance the costs of implementing the state audit reform program under the STARSDP. The \nPLMU will prepare and submit to ADB and the ISC, within 21 days after the quarter, quarterly \nprogress reports in a format acceptable to ADB. The reports will analyze institutional and legal \ndevelopments in the audit sector as well as the evolution of key indicators, emphasizing areas \nand measures outlined in the policy matrix. At the end of the Program, the PLMU will submit the \ncompletion report to ADB within three months of physical completion of the program loan \nconditions.  \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n \n1.  Components and Outputs \n \n59.  The  investment  project  of  the  STARSDP  comprises  five  main  components: \n(i) establishment of sector development project management in the form of an Investment Loan \nMonitoring Unit (ILMU) in BAPPENAS, which will be the Executing Agency for the investment \ncomponent;  (ii) introduction  of  new  systems  and  practices  for  effective  external  audit; \n(iii) institutional enhancement and repositioning through new regulatory structures and practices \nfor effective internal audit covering, as applicable, the inspectorate generals (IGs), BAWASDAs, \nand  BPKP;  (iv)  assistance  to  a  professional  formal  education  and  nonformal  certification \n ", "16 \nprogram for internal auditors; and (v) introduction of new practices for parliamentary oversight of \npublic sector audit. The major activities under each component are listed below.  \n \n60.  Establishment of an Investment Loan Monitoring Unit. This component will support \nthe implementation arrangements detailed below. In particular, expert staff will be provided for \nproject accounting and reporting, procurement, project monitoring, and financial management. \nThis unit will be headed by an senior staff member, who will be given funds to consolidate \nquarterly  reporting  from  the  component  implementation  unit  (CIUs)  of  the  investment \ncomponent, complete midterm reviews, carry out surveys, hire external auditors for annual \naudits, and prepare the project completion report.  \n \n61.  Introduction  New  Systems  and Practices  for  Effective  External  Audit.  The  key \nactivities will be to establish a component implementation management unit in BPK, develop \nnew  systems  and  work  procedures  consistent  with  an  enhanced  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, develop a strategic approach for human resource management, implement a staff \ndevelopment  program,  introduce  a  new  strategic  approach  for  information  resources \nmanagement, pilot new audit procedures for selected audits, and develop a program for public \nawareness and support for effective audit.  \n \n62.  Establishing new systems and work procedures will include helping the new BPK board \nlearn through a study tour how other SAIs operate; help BPK develop a new approach to audit \nplanning  and  management,  including  how  to  manage  the  decentralized  offices;  develop  a \nrevised code of ethics in line with international standards; train BPK in the rudiments of risk-\nbased  auditing  procedures;  help  develop  and  train  staff  in  specialized  audits  such  as \nperformance, IT, military, and forensic audits; develop techniques for introducing recommended \nactions for audit findings into audit reports; and develop new techniques for presenting audit \nreports.  When  new  techniques  are  introduced,  current  conditions  will  be  analyzed,  new \nprocedures  piloted,  and  a  workshop  held  to  validate  the  experiences  before  these  are \nincorporated into procedures and manuals.  \n \n63.  A  strategic  human  resource  development  plan  will  provide  new  audit  manuals, \nguidelines, and training programs to introduce the new procedures to BPK staff as well as \ncareer development plans. Staff members will be selected to undertake specialized certification \noverseas or in Indonesia to obtain the necessary internationally recognized certification such as \nIT, forensic, military, and commercial and central bank audits. Staff members will be sent on \nselected secondment in comparable SAIs to acquire practical experience in a number of areas. \nAbout 200 BPK staff members will benefit from certification and secondment experience.  \n \n64.  IT management will establish an IT policy for acquisition, support, replacement, and \nasset management. Recognizing that the considerable capital investment in IT systems that \nBPK requires will need to be managed, the policy will include a disaster recovery plan, and a \nsystem for electronic archiving of audit files and reports. To provide a basis for further use of IT, \npilots will be undertaken on the use of videoconferencing, distance-learning techniques, and the \nuse of electronic tools for audit team management. Computers will be provided to staff members \nin a staged manner so they can use IT-based audit techniques, onsite and offsite, in field \nlocations.  \n \n65.  The new techniques will be piloted through supervised applications on selected audits to \ntest their practical applicability and the usefulness of the manuals, and will be revised where \nnecessary. This piloting is essential as it will mainstream techniques adopted into the standard \nwork program, and avoid the risk that the development of new techniques and manuals will \nsimply  be  a  theoretical  exercise.  Peer  reviews  will  be  funded  during  the  component\u2019s \nimplementation to assess the Project\u2019s progress.  \n ", "17 \n \n66.  The model public relations program will be developed through workshops to develop \nmodels for the use of print, television, and radio media, and through pilot studies to publicize \nBPK reports and post the reports on the Internet, thus raising public awareness.  \n \n67.  Introduction of New Regulatory Structures and Practices for Effective Internal \nAudit. BAWASDA support will be coordinated through the MOHA-IG, where a CIU will be \nestablished. Under Articles 6 and 9 of Government Regulation 20/01, MOHA is responsible for \ncoordinating regional governments and fostering their development. The MOHA-IG CIU will \ncoordinate the work, and facilitate the development, of the BAWASDAs through implementing \nunits established in each BAWASDA and staffed by secondment from the BAWASDA. The \nimplementing unit in turn will work with a regional government committee made up of members \nof the BAWASDA, the regional chief executive, and members of the implementing unit The \nBAWASDA function in approximately 50 regional governments will be supported under this \nproject. Eligibility criteria for selecting districts and provinces to be supported are in Appendix \n14.  \n \n68.  This  component  will  also  support  the  development  of  the  draft  regulations  (SKs \n/PERDAs) for the BAWASDA function. In addition, this component will develop a model IDP that \nwill help the BAWASDAs assess themselves and establish a long-term perspective on their \ncapacity needs. The draft SK, PERDAs, and IDP will be disseminated nationwide through the \nexisting BPK regional centers as templates for all regional government. The CIU will develop a \ndatabase to track the adoption of the regulations. The adoption of the regulations and IDP will \nbe supported, as a pilot project, in initially 16 regional governments that are willing to adopt the \nregulations.  The  lessons  learned will  then  be  used  by  the  other  34  regional governments \nsupported by the project.  \n \n69.  Lump-sum capacity building grants, disbursed in two or three installments, of up to a \ntotal of $115,000 for each BAWASDA will be allocated to help regional governments strengthen \nthe BAWASDA function. Conditions for disbursement of the first installment will be a Letter of \nReadiness signed by the Bupati and verified by the MOHA IG CIU confirming that the following \nhas been undertaken, (i) adoption of the local regulation (SK or PERDA) on the BAWASDA \nfunction,  (ii) completion of an IDP drawn up by the MOHA-IG implementing unit and approved \nby a regional government committee, on the utilization of the lump sum grants, (iii) the signing of \nan implementation agreement between the chief executive and the MOHA -IG implementation \nunit and (iv) confirmation that counterpart funds and facilities have been provided by the local \ngovernment chief executive. The first installment request cannot exceed 50% of the total grant \nallocation. In addition, the second and third installments will be released on receipt of an \nunqualified annual audit report from the STARSDP auditor, and the commitment of at least 70% \nof the previous installments. An additional requirement of the second installment will be the \nMOU required for the scholarship component as detailed in para. 72 below. Only 20% of the \ntotal value of this lump sum can be used to purchase equipment. Additional lump sums will be \ngiven  to  provide  educational  and  certification  support  for  the  BAWASDAs  through  local \neducation  providers.  These  scholarships  are  detailed  below  in  the  formal  education  and \nnonformal  certification  component.  Finally,  the  BAWASDAs  will  be  supported  through  the \ndevelopment  of  standardized  work  procedures  and  manuals,  which  will  be  disseminated \nnationwide and adopted through the utilization of the capacity building grants.  \n \n70.  The  IG  function  (approximately  16  ministries  have  been  identified)  will  be  similarly \nsupported through establishment of a CIU in the MOF-IG. Key activities will be to develop new \nfinancial  audit  work  procedures  consistent  with  the  IG  mandate,  develop  risk-based  audit \nprocedures; develop specialized auditing techniques, pilot the use of peer reviews, develop \n ", "18 \nrelevant  audit  manuals  and  guidelines,  and  provide  computer  equipment  to  each  IG.27 \nEducational and certification support for IG staff will be provided through local universities, as \ndetailed below in the professional education and certification component.  \n \n71.  BPKP will be supported to develop an IDP reflecting its new mandate. Guidelines and \nmanuals will be developed, and computer hardware and software provided.  \n \n72.  Designing a Professional Formal Education and Nonformal Certification Program \nfor Internal Auditors. This component will be implemented through the Ministry of Education \nIG for the formal education program and, the training center in MOF (BPPK), for nonformal \neducation courses. This component\u2019s key output will be to design education and certification \ncourses that IG internal audit staff and BAWASDA staff can take, on scholarship, and cost-\neffectively at local educational institutions. This component recognizes the need to use the \nexisting local education infrastructure; the fact that BAWASDA staff need education ranging, \nfrom a tertiary degree to specialized audit and accounting certification; the need for courses to \nbe affordable and sustainable beyond the project; and the fact that IG and BAWASDA staff \ncannot be away from their positions for long. The key activities will be a review of the current \neducation  and  certification  programs  for  government  sector  accounting  and  auditing, \ndevelopment  of  new  curricula  for  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing  that  can  be \nmainstreamed  into  existing  degree  and  certification  courses,  development  of  non-formal \nvocational education courses, promulgation of courses to various educational establishments, \nestablishment of mechanisms to select the institutions to deliver education support as well as \neligible candidates to receive the support.  \n \n73.  Lump-sum scholarships (up to $50,000 for each of the 50 BAWASDAs, and up to \n$100,000 for each of the 16 IGs) will be allocated to the local universities providing the courses. \nOnce the suite of appropriate courses is developed, eligible regional universities, as identified \nby the Ministry of Education, will be requested to present a plan, developed with the local \ngovernments and IGs, that will indicate how the courses can be used by the local governments \nand IGs. This will result eventually in an implementation MOU between the university and the \nlocal government/IG. These scholarship plans will include details of the courses to be provided, \nindicative  number  of  students,  student  eligibility  criteria  and  the  costing,  and  tracking  and \nreporting methodology on the scholarships provided. No funds will be given directly to the IG or \nBAWASDA for this component, as money will be transferred directly through direct payment to \nthe university. For each participating Bawasda the university will open a separate bank account \nto receive the scholarship funds. Each IG and BAWASDA will be required to certify that 80% of \nstaff benefiting from this support are existing staff of the internal audit function, and have been \nworking in that capacity for the prior two years. Up to 20% of the training costs can be allocated \nto staff from outside the internal audit function if the courses are certified relevant for the job \nfunction. All courses have to be completed within the STARSDP project period. A schematic \ndiagram of how this component will operate is in Supplementary Appendix F. The objective is to \nbuild a strong base of individuals qualified in various aspects of financial management.  \n \n74.  Introduction of New Practices for Parliamentary Oversight of Public Sector Audit. \nThis  component  will  enhance  the  capability  of  the  Parliament  and  regional  parliaments\u2019 \nsecretariats  to  help  parliamentary  members  perform  their  oversight  function  effectively. \nParliament  support  will  be  coordinated  through  the  Parliament  secretariat,  and  regional \nparliament support, through the MOF-IG. MOUs will be established between the Parliament \nsecretariat  and  BPK,  and  between  the  regional  parliament  secretariats  and  BPK.  This \n                                                 \n27 Reference will be made to the audit manual prepared under an ADB TA. ADB 2004.  Strengthening the Capacity of \nMinistry for Settlements and Regional Infrastructure to Control Fraud and Corruption. Manila (INO-3842-INO). \n ", "19 \ncomponent will be undertaken in a consultative manner involving the Parliament and regional \nparliament secretariat staff, BPK, and select Parliament and regional parliament members.28  \n \n75.  For DPR support, the three main components will be the establishment of the CIU, \ndevelopment of a plan for the submission of BPK audit findings and recommendations to DPR \nmembers, and development of client-friendly audit reporting formats for a range of BPK audits. \nThe intention is to develop intelligible summarized audit reporting formats that can be readily \nused and understood by the Parliament\u2019s committees, thus ensuring that appropriate follow-up \naction is agreed on and actions monitored. These reports will be published in the Parliament \nand BPK Web site. \n \n76.  For the regional parliament secretariats, a similar approach will be taken. A plan will be \ndeveloped for the secretariats for the submission of BPK audit findings and recommendations to \nDPRD members, and BPK findings will be produced in short reports for regional parliament \nmembers.  Regional  parliament  secretariats  in  50  eligible  local  governments  (based  on \nBAWASDA selection criteria) will receive up to $30,000 each to build capacity to help regional \nparliament members understand and identify the appropriate follow-up action to BPK\u2019s audit \nreports. The MOHA-IG will be helped to deploy the model public relations and awareness \nprogram  developed  under  the  BPK  component.  This  program  will  disseminate  information \nregionally on the role of internal and external audit and include the publication of BPK audit \nreports in local media.  \n \n2.  Financing Plan \n \n77.  The total project cost is estimated at $42.7 million, consisting of $11.5 million (26.9%) in \nforeign exchange cost and $31.2 million (73.1%) equivalent in local currency cost. Table 1 \nsummarizes the indicative financing plan for the Project, and Table 2, the cost estimates.  \n \n78.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights 16,680,000 to the Republic of Indonesia from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF).    The  Government  has  requested  grant  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands for $5 million. The ADB loan will have an amortization period of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, with interest, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. ADB and the \nGovernment of the Netherlands will finance around 70.0% of the Project, including 100.0% of \nthe foreign exchange cost and 54.7% of the local currency cost. Details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n79.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years.  An  annual  project  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. It is proposed that BAPPENAS be the Executing Agency for the \ninvestment Project, and that this component supports an ILMU. In addition to having full-time \nlocal staff for project management, financial management accounting and procurement, and \ntranslation,  the  unit  will  be  given  external  consultants  in  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement,  who  will  establish  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS).  The \ncomponent will support the midterm review, annual project audits, and surveys.  \n \n80.  An ILMU will be established in BAPPENAS to coordinate a number of CIUs established \nin each agency implementing all or part of a component. The CIUs are detailed in Table 3. \n                                                 \n28 The project team has worked closely with the Technical Assistance Monitoring Facility of Australian Aid Agency \n(AusAid). \n ", "20 \nBAPPENAS will establish an interagency project steering committee (ISC) made up of echelon-\n1  staff  from  each  CIU  to  oversee  component  implementation  and  to  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination.  \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \nItem Foreign Local Total Percent\n ADB-ADF 7,905.6 17,095.2 25,000.8 58.5\n Cofinanced 3,585.9 1,415.4 5,001.3 11.7\n Regional Government 0.0 4,224.7 4,224.7 9.9\n Central Government 0.0 8,503.6 8,503.6 19.9\n   Total 11,491.6 31,238.9 42,730.4 100.0\n \nADB=Asian Development Bank, ADF=Asian Development Fund. \nSources: ADB. 2003.

The project will provide 96 person-months of international and \n902  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The \ninternational and domestic consultants will be engaged through consulting firms in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  procurement  unit  under  the  ILMU  in  BAPPENAS  will  be  responsible  for  all  the \nadministrative requirements for procurement. All master contracts will be maintained by the \nILMU. Procurement committees will be established for each procurement package and chaired \nby the project manager of the CIU to which the package belongs. The outline terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n82.  Computer Equipment. The Project will finance the computer hardware and related IT \nequipment required. Goods financed under the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines for procurement. Items of similar type will be grouped together as far as \npossible to permit bulk procurement and to encourage international competitive bidding. Prior \nADB approval of lists and specifications of equipment will be required. All computers and related \nIT equipment will be procured under an umbrella procurement contract negotiated by the ILMU \nunder international competitive bidding. The ILMU will notify the details of the umbrella contract \nto the respective CIU, which will ensure that all computer equipment is purchased using the \ncontract. Deliveries will be made directly to the beneficiary, who will acknowledge receipt of the \nitems. BPK, IG, DPR, and BPKP payments to the contractor will be by direct payment from \nADB. For equipment purchased by the local governments and DPRD, payments will be made \ndirectly from lump-sum contributions (para. 73 and para.74).  \n \n83.  Disbursement  Arrangements.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  BAPPENAS  will \nchannel part of the loan proceeds into an imprest account to finance eligible small expenditures. \nThe imprest account will be solely for the Project\u2019s purposes and will be established at the Bank \nIndonesia (BI). The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, and with detailed \narrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest account will \nbe  $2.5  million.

The reports will indicate, among other things, progress made against established \ntargets, problems encountered during the quarter, steps taken and proposed to resolve the \nproblems, compliance with loan covenants, and proposed project activities to be undertaken \nduring the following quarter. All reports will be in English. Each CIU will submit monthly reports, \nand the ILMUs and PLMUs will submit quarterly consolidated reports to ADB within 20 days \nfrom the end of each quarter, using formats detailed in the project administration manual. The \nPLMU  and  ILMU  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  within  three  months  of  project \ncompletion.  \n \n86.  Project Reviews. ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual reviews of the \nProject  to  assess  progress  and  to  identify  constraints.  During  the  first  two  years  of \nimplementation, semiannual reviews are required. The Government and ADB will undertake a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  the  third  year  of  its  implementation.  The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the \nProject; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; (iii) assess progress of \nthe project implementation against performance indicators; (iv) review compliance with loan \ncovenants;  and  (v)  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements. The ILMU will collate the peer review and overseas study tour reports under the \nvarious components to determine lessons learned. These will be consolidated as appropriate \ninto reports and submitted to the relevant agencies and to ADB.  \n \n87.  Information System. The PLMU, ILMU, and CIUs will develop, with the assistance of \nconsultants, a PPMS to assess the project impact and its effectiveness. The ILMU monitoring \nand evaluation officer will maintain the system and collect and analyze data in cooperation with \nthe project implementing agencies. Key system indicators will be used in the ILMU\u2019s quarterly \nprogress reports. The monitoring and evaluation system will endeavor to include participation by \n ", "23 \nbeneficiary communities and individuals. An indication of the types the outcomes for each \ncomponent can be seen in Supplementary Appendix E, with specific outcomes highlighted in the \nlogical framework in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n88.  Technical assistance (TA) grants will be provided to the PLMU to help ensure that the \ndeliverables on the policy matrix are achieved, and to the ILMU to provide in-depth project \nmonitoring  and  reporting  assistance,  as  well  as  additional  quality  assurance  through  the \nestablishment of regional monitoring teams. The TAs will be funded by the Government of the \nNetherlands up to $5.0 million, with $1.3 million going to the PLMU and $3.7 million to the ILMU. \nAppendix 13 has further details of the terms of reference and costing for the TAs.  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n89.  Social Benefits. The STARSDP will reduce poverty in a sustainable way by improving \nthe public sector audit function, which is economic, efficient, effective, and in accordance with \ngood institutional practice and standards. Transparency in financial management, and public \nparticipation in the process, will increase. A holistic approach will increase integration and \ncomplementarity between the audit institutions, and interaction between the audit sector and \ncivil society, thus strengthening the accountability framework in the public sector. This approach \nwill provide the checks and balances for increased public confidence and participation in the \npublic sector. Appendix 12 highlights the summary poverty reduction and social analysis.  \n \n90.  Economic Benefits. The nature of the Project does not allow quantitative financial and \neconomic analyses to be carried out. However, the STARSDP will contribute significantly to the \noverall reform agenda for a democratic and decentralized Indonesia, which is still in transition \nfrom an autocratic, centralized form of government. Improved financial management will mean \nthat  scarce  government  resources  will  be  better  used  and  more  effectively  deployed  than \nbefore. General economic benefits will accrue from increased regional and central government \nefficiency  through  improved  performance,  transparency,  and  increased  public-private \npartnerships. Investor confidence will improve owing to strengthened governance.  \n \n91.  Technical  Benefits.  The  Program  provides  significant  technical  improvements  in \nauditing practices, including the use of IT-based systems and exposure to international systems \nand practices. The Indonesian audit sector will be better integrated with the international audit \ncommunity, thus allowing it to meet international trends. Through the scholarship and training \nprograms, the STARSDP will increase the number of qualified financial management staff at the \ncentral  and  regional  levels.  By  creating  uniform  certification  and  training  standards,  the \nSTARSDP will improve the mobility of individuals and thus their job opportunities. At the same \ntime, the educational institutions will be able to increase their focus on providing the requisite \ntraining for the public sector, thus ensuring the sustainability of the training programs developed.  \n \n92.  Involuntary Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environmental Benefits. The \nProject has no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, and will not affect indigenous peoples. \nIt does not require an initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment \nunder Indonesian laws and regulations. The Program is expected to have no adverse impact on \nthe environment.  \n \n ", "24 \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n \n93.  Low  government  commitment  to  reform,  weak  ownership  of  the  policy  package, \ninsufficient  consultation  with  the  Government,  and  overly  complex  and  ambitious  policy \nconditionalities  are  considered  the  major  risks  of  policy-based  lending.  The  STARSDP \nformulation process attempted to minimize these risks in several ways: (i) the policy framework \nhas been well articulated with the Government, and has received political commitment at the \ncentral and regional levels; (ii) the duration of the program loan activities, number of tranches, \nand  phasing  of  policy  actions  conform  with  the  gradual  approach  to  change  adopted  in \nIndonesia;  and  (iii)  consultation  on  a  detailed  policy  matrix  started  at  an  early  stage  of \nSTARSDP preparation, concentrated on a few core reforms, and involved a wide range of \nGovernment  counterparts,  most  of  which  remained  involved  throughout  the  process.  The \narticulation between policy actions and project interventions of the STARSDP increases the \nsafeguards  for  reform  implementation.  Institutional  or  legal  measures  indispensable  to \nimplement the Project have been inserted into the policy matrix. Conversely, the Project will \nsupport activities to ensure that policy changes are appropriately designed and their feasibility \nfully assessed from the financial and institutional perspectives. The policy matrix articulates \nSTARSDP reform actions with interventions supported by other ongoing ADB operations.  \n \n94.  The greatest threat of poor audit performance is in  regional government accountability. \nGiven limited funds, the investment program is designed to build up a critical mass of regional \ninternal audit institutions supported by a strengthened external audit. The design of the local \nregulation template will be disseminated nationwide to establish a consistent national legal and \nregulatory framework for internal audit. The focus on 50 BAWASDAs will clearly identify a \npackage of measures provided through lump-sum grants for institutional capacity and education \nthat can easily be duplicated by other aid agencies either through cofinancing of this project or \nseparately. This additional funding will benefit from the legal and institutional framework put in \nplace during the STARSDP.  \n \n95.  The risk of late provision of counterpart funds and staff has been minimized by requiring \nthe Government to establish the project management and monitoring structure (ISC, PCMU, \nPLMU, and ILMU). Qualified personnel will fill the expert positions, already endorsed by the \nGovernment, so that the additional burden on the Government budget will be minimal. The \nGovernment has carefully identified and reviewed the STARSDP\u2019s recurrent cost implications.  \n \n96.  Transparency and accuracy of data for monitoring purposes constitute another major \nproblem as poor quality and low policy relevance of indicators may lead to inaccurate analyses \nand possible mis-targeting of interventions. In the STARSDP, this risk is considered limited in \nview of the assistance provided for auditing and monitoring. In addition, a self-check mechanism \nis being built into the project with BPK and the IGs, besides the external auditor, auditing \naspects of the project. The aim is to induce Government ownership and better benchmarking of \nthe implementation and audit issues arising out of development projects rather than wait for an \nexternal auditor to highlight them in an annual audit.  \n \n97.  In spite of recent progress, the project implementation capacities of central agencies \nremain weak, and could seriously delay implementation. Staff of executing agencies needs to \nbe adequately trained in all areas of project management, and particular guidance is required to \nensure compliance with ADB procedures. The upfront appointment and training of PCMU, \nPLMU, and ILMU staff, and the engagement of international individual consultants to assist the \nPCMU in project administration, constitute essential safeguards of the STARSDP.  \n \n98.  Deficient  intra-governmental  coordination  and  decision-making  processes  are  other \nnoted project implementation risks. The characteristics of the STARSDP management structure \n ", "25 \nhelp  minimize  these  risks  by  facilitating  concerted  action  and  information  sharing  among \nagencies while respecting the existing hierarchical lines. Implementation arrangements and \nresponsibilities are shared among several agencies and to avoid overloading any single agency. \nThe ILMU and PCU have been placed under BAPPENAS through a consensus decision. The \nISC,  composed  of  high-level  government  officials  representing  the  main  implementation \nagencies, will ensure interagency coordination and facilitate the resolution of important project \nand program implementation issues. Senior officials have been entrusted with the functions of \noverall STARSDP, ILMU, and PLMU directors.  \n \n99.  The specific risk associated with the possibility that the BPKP\u2019s position will not be \nrealigned has been addressed in a number of ways. The risk itself has been mitigated by \nensuring that the legal and institutional framework, and the capacity of the internal and external \ninstitutions that form the core of the state audit sector (BPK, IG, and BAWASDA) will be clearly \ndefined  and  strengthened.  Furthermore,  the  other  audit  institutions  have  begun  to  assert \nthemselves at the central or regional level. The Government has already initiated this process \nthrough various laws and regulations, but this project will clearly establish the end state for the \ninstitutional framework, leaving the lesser risk of BPKP remaining as an internal audit institution \nwith significant resources and overlapping mandates. This situation then becomes less easy to \ndefend  internally,  and  the  consensus  for change  already exists.  Even  BPKP  is  looking  at \ndifferent ways to realign itself. Significantly, BPKP has agreed to be part of the interministerial \ncommittee that the policy agenda has delineated. The concerns over any potential impact on \nstaff within BPKP arising from the possible realignment have been mitigated by the ability and \nneeds  of  other  audit  institutions  to  absorb  any  displaced  BPKP  staff.  This  is  particularly \nimportant at the regional level. The demographics of the key audit organizations are such that \nretirements in the next few years will allow for a natural rationalization of size.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n100.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents. The Government will (i) \nfulfill conditions agreed upon and specified in the policy matrix for the release of the first and \nsecond tranches of the program loan, and will promptly adopt other policies and undertake \nactions as described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix; (ii) ensure that ISC \nand PSC meet quarterly throughout the STARSDP implementation period for the purpose of \nmonitoring,  and  that  ad  hoc  PSC  meetings  are  convened  promptly  to  settle  project \nimplementation  issues  requiring  high-level  decisions;  (iii)  ensure  that  timely  and  accurate \nquarterly  progress  reports  are  produced  and  that  adverse  audit  findings  are  followed  up \neffectively and on time; (iv) ensure that civil servants to be trained under the Project\u2014primarily \nBAWASDA and IG staff\u2014will be selected according to criteria agreed upon with ADB and will be \nreleased from regular duties to permit their participation in training activities; (v) implement a \nbonding system to ensure that staff members trained overseas under the Project agree to \nremain in the audit function of the Government for at least 2 full financial years as a condition for \nundertaking the study; (vi) bear all recurrent costs, during and after implementation of the \nSTARSPD, incurred to establish the various audit activities, including staff salaries and related \npayments, maintenance of equipment and facilities, communications, transportation, supplies \nand materials, and other operating expenses; (vii) take reasonable measure to ensure that, \nthroughout  the  duration  of  the  STARSPD,  all  personnel  contributing  to  its  implementation \nreceive remuneration commensurate with their responsibilities and workload; (viii) ensure the \ntimely release of counterpart funds; and (ix) complete the establishment, within three months of \nloan effectiveness of a PPMS, for the STAR-SDP.  \n ", "26 \n \nB.  Conditions of Loan Effectiveness \n \n101.  In  addition  to  standard  conditions  for  effectiveness,  before  effectiveness  of  (i)  the \nprogram loan, (a) the Government will establish the deposit account at the BI; and (b) the \nproject loan agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower, \nand all conditions precedent to its effectiveness shall have been fulfilled; and (ii) the project \nloan: (a) the committee for the recruitment of the consultants to support the operations of the \nILMU will be established; and (b) the program Loan Agreement will have been duly executed \nand  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  and  all conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness \nfulfilled.  \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n102.  Disbursement on the Program Loan will take place once the Government has carried out  \nactions specifically identified as conditions for tranche release in the policy matrix, and has  \ndemonstrated satisfactory progress in implementing other actions in the policy matrix. For each \ntranche release the Government will submit, for ADB approval, a withdrawal application, in the \nformat and conditions as specified in the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook, June 2001. \nDisbursement on the investment loan will be made once the project specific imprest account \nhas been established, and on approval of  withdrawal applications submitted in the format \nspecified in the ADB  Loan Disbursement Handbook, June 2001. \n \nVII.

Summaries of Issues by Institution. The tables below summarize the main issues that \nwere highlighted in the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program (STARSDP) sector \nstudy. Other than, on the Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK) and Government internal audit agency \n(BPKP), there are no readily available statistics on the Inspector Generals (IGs) or the regional \ngovernment internal auditors (BAWASDAs). The study examined five representative IGs to \nglean the issues facing their role and mandates. These IGs were MSRI, MONE, MOF, Ministry \nof Communication, and MOHA. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of BAWASDAs through a standardized questionnaire. Over 76% of the 32 provincial and \n442  district  BAWASDAs  responded.  A  number  of  workshops  were  held  with  the  IGs  and \nrepresentative BAWASDAs to identify the main issues. \n \nTable A1.2: External Audit: Issues Related to BPK \n \n Condition   Emerging Issues \nMandate   The primary issue concerning BPK, Indonesia\u2019s supreme audit agency, is whether or not it has \nthe staff, facilities, and other resources necessary to fulfill its expanded mandate under the \nrecently enacted Third Amendment to the 1945 Constitution, Law 17/03, and implementing \nregulations. An important addition is the requirement for BPK to audit the financial \naccountability statements of central and regional governments within 6 months of the end of \nthe financial year. Other laws such as the Clean Government Law (Law 28/99) and the \nAnticorruption Law (Law 31/1999) provide that BPK will carry out further investigations as \nrequired. \n \nLaw 5/73 is considered deficient as it fails to provide for \n\u2022  a clear definition on the scope of BPK\u2019s audits;  \n\u2022  the apolitical election process for the members of the board;  \n\u2022  indemnity from prosecution for BPK staff members conducting audit;  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s administrative independence, and the use of auditing standards consistent with \ninternational best practice;  \n\u2022  effective follow-up of recommendations;  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s relationship to Parliament, and its freedom to release report findings to the public; \n\u2022  adequate authority to access information from those audited;  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s relationship with internal auditors; and  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s role in a decentralized Indonesia.  \n \nOversight  \u2022  Parliament does not usually receive or have regular access to individual BPK audit reports; \n  Parliament receives summaries of edited versions of individual reports.  \n\u2022  Ministries appear to have no legislated or policy-based obligation to address issues raised \nin reports.  \n\u2022  Reports are not generally made public.  \n\u2022  Regional Parliaments oversight authority has increased since the enactment of Law \n22/1999, and Article 18 gives DPRD the right to approve the audited annual accountability \nreport of the head of the local executive: the governor in the province, and the chief \nexecutive in the districts. However, they do not have the skills to carry out that oversight \nfunction. \nOperational   \nStaff Resources  \u2022  BPK estimates total resources needed at about 5,000 staff members, about twice its \n  current staffing. \n  \u2022  The executive branch, specifically the State Personnel Board, allocates staff resources, \n  which are usually well below requested needs.  \n  \u2022  Too few types of audits are conducted. Financial audits comprise most of them, and \nTypes of Audits  performance audits make up some. Other types such as forensic, contract, compliance, \nConducted  program, computer, public debt, environmental, export/import, policy, and privatization \n  audits are not being conducted. \n  \u2022  Recruiting requirements that limit hiring to accountants and exclude multidisciplinary \nRecruiting  candidates may be impeding expansion of the nature and types of audits that can be \n  conducted.  \n   \n   \n \n ", "Appendix 1    29\n Condition   Emerging Issues \nComputerization  \u2022  The system does not adequately track audit recommendations so they can be followed up. \nand Enhanced  Audit follow-up may be limited because of an inadequate tracking system.  \nInformation  \u2022  Substantive follow-up on fraud audit cases referred to the Attorney General\u2019s Office are \nTechnology  lacking and do not result in an affirmative prosecutorial action. An electronic system for \n  tracking compliance with continuing professional education requirements is still under \n  development, and responsibility for managing that system has yet to be decided.  \n  \u2022  Some audits and the resultant audit reports lacked quality.  \n  \u2022  Some audit reports did not comply with a model comprising best practices and related audit \n  report standards, reflecting on the internal systems in place to assure quality audits and \nAudit Quality  quality audit reports.  \nand Internal \n\u2022  Audit managers and auditors in charge, rather than organization officials such as the chair \nQuality  or other officials, sign reports.  \nAssurance  \n \n  \n\u2022  Training has not been adequate to increase performance audits and/or the variety of types \n \nof audits that could be conducted.  \n \n\u2022  Training has not kept pace with the movement to increase use of computerization and \nReporting \nenhanced information technology.  \nTraining \n\u2022  Training has been unable to correct deficient audit and report quality or to strengthen the \n \ninternal quality assurance system.  \nInternational  \u2022  SAI audit results should be used to improve government. Ministries appear to have no \nPractice  legislated or policy-based obligation to address issues raised in reports.  \n(benchmarking)  \u2022  In line with concepts of accountability, transparency, and oversight, audit reports should be \nmade readily available to the public and widely distributed. Audit reports are not generally \nmade public.  \n\u2022  Audit organizations, to gauge the effectiveness of their impact on government activities, \nshould monitor the actions taken by those audited in connection with the conclusions and \nrecommendations stated in audit reports. The system does not adequately track audit \nrecommendations and thus audit follow-up may be limited.  \n\u2022  To help make certain that audit work is of an acceptable quality and competence, SAIs \nshould develop quality measures for their audit work, supported by policies and procedures \nthat help assure that audit standards are consistently and uniformly applied. Deficiencies in \naudit execution and reports demonstrate that the quality assurance system may not be \nadequate.  \nBPK State Audit Board of Indonesia, SAI Supreme Audit Agency. \nADB. 2003.

Manila (INO-TA 4107) \n \nTable A1.3: Internal Audit: Issues Related to BPKP \n \n   Emerging Issues \nCondition \nMandate   \u2022  Certain new regulations have reduced BPKP\u2019s mandate. BPKP can no longer  \n\u2022  initiate audit activities in regional governments ( Presidential Decree 74/01, which \nassigns only regional internal audit organizations the right to audit local governments\u2019 \nbudgets);  \n\u2022  perform financial audits of state-owned enterprises (Law 19/03); and   \n\u2022  perform financial audits of private limited liabilities entities (Law 1/95). \n \n\u2022   The original Presidential Decree 31/83 was revoked but its replacement (Law 42/01) and \nassociated Presidential Decree (103/2001)1 did not sufficiently define BPKP\u2019s objectives \nscope, organizational structure, or staffing, and is unclear about BPKP\u2019s duties and functions \nin a decentralized Indonesia. \n\u2022   BPKP has retained residual responsibilities ideally situated in the other audit institutions. It \nstill has the mandate to certify public sector internal auditors; it has some responsibility for \nthe performance accountability reports of government entities and is still considered the \nexternal auditor on most ADB and World Bank lending projects  \nOversight  \u2022  Reports are not routinely shared with either the President or Parliament. They periodically \nreceive only report summaries.  \n\u2022  No audit committee oversees the management and execution of BPKP\u2019s work. \n                                                 \n1  Presidential Decree 103/2001, Position, Duty, Function, Authority, Organizational Structure and the Working Order \nof Nondepartmental Government Institutions. \n ", "30  Appendix 1 \n   Emerging Issues \nCondition \n\u2022  BPK does not scrutinize BPKP.  \nOperational   \nCoordination   \n  \u2022  Certain BPKP audits overlap with similar IG audits.  \n Standards   \n  \u2022  BPKP does not use one set of recognized internal audit standards; it uses \u201cstandards\u201d it has \n  developed from a number of other recognized standards for one type of audit, and another \n  set of standards for other types of audits.  \nRisk-based   \nValue-adding  \u2022  BPKP does not now use risk-based audit target selection.  \nAudits  \u2022  It does not have a system for routinely compiling the cost of its audits to determine whether \n  they are adding value.  \n Reporting  \u2022  The signature authority for BPKP reports has been vested in the 25 regional chairpersons in \n \nas many regional offices. This raises a question as to how BPKP is able to assure quality in \n  its audit work and generate and maintain a uniform, consistent institutional product\u2014an audit \n \nreport\u2014in light of this dispersion.  \n \n\u2022  All except one of a sample of 15 BPKP audit reports did not fully comply with generally \n \naccepted reporting practices.  \n \n\u2022  BPKP does not usually make its reports public, and its reports are not distributed outside the \n \naudited entity.  \n \n\u2022  Few regional governments are sending auditors to BPKP training, partly because they do not \nTraining \nknow about the need for the training.  \n International  BPKP may not be fully compliant with some of the benchmarks as shown in chapter 3. For \npractice  example, while BPKP is considered an internal audit organization by law, it does not use one set \n(benchmarking)  of recognized internal audit standards, such as those promulgated by the IIA. It uses \u201cstandards\u201d \nit has developed from a number of other recognized standards for one type of audit, and another \nset of standards for other types of audits. It does not now use risk-based audit target selection \nas recommended in internal audit standards.  \nPrimary Issue  The primary issue concerning BPKP is whether its staff, facilities, and other resources are \nappropriate for its mandate, in accordance with Law 32/04 and Law 33/04. \nBPKP Government Internal Audit Agency \nADB. 2003.

Manila (INO-TA 4107)) \n \n \nTable A1.4: Internal Audit: Issues Related to Inspectorates General \n \n Condition   Emerging Issues \nMandate    \nOversight  Other than being reported to the minister, IG audit activities appear not to be vetted, \n  examined, or monitored.  \nRecruiting  \u2022  There is no one recruiting standard. One IG recruits mostly accountants or person having \n  accounting background; other IGs recruit staff with various backgrounds. This can impede \n  some IGs\u2019 ability to expand the nature and types of audits that can be conducted. \nSkill levels  \u2022  IG staff may not possess the skills needed to conduct all types of audits. Many IGs require \nthe assistance of BPKP to conduct audits. Routine technical performance audits, as well \nas financial and special audits, are sometimes carried out with BPKP\u2019s assistance.  \n Types of audits  \u2022  At least one IG did not conduct financial audits. It relied on BPKP to do it. \n Standards  \u2022  IGs used audit standards inconsistently; few used the same standards or those \n  promulgated by a standard-setting body such as the IIA or those reconcilable with audit \n  standards.  \n  \u2022  Some IGs used no audit standards at all.  \n  \u2022  One IG (MOF-IG) has issued its own audit standards \n Productivity  \u2022  The ratio of IG audit staff members to audit reports issued ranged from about one report \nfor each staff member to almost seven a year.  \n\u2022  The proportion of auditors on IG staff ranged from 67% to 42%. \n Reporting  \u2022  A review of audit reports at selected ministries disclosed that none of the reports fully \n  complied with \u201cbest practices\u201d audit-reporting techniques.  \n  \u2022  There are various signatory authorities for IG reports. At one IG, the chief of the team that \n  conducted the audit signs the report. At that ministry, the inspector general does not sign \n  any audit reports. At another ministry, the inspector general signs all the reports. \n ", "Appendix 1    31\n Condition   Emerging Issues \n  \u2022  The extent of auditor training was sporadic, depending on the budget, and unsystematic \nTraining  and inconsistent. Data on auditor training\u2014amount spent on it and other details\u2014were \n  often not readily available, and what was available was sometimes inaccurate.  \n  \u2022  Training in forensic auditing does not appear to be required, and some auditor training was \n  not especially directed at enhancing audit skills. Some IGs had no special auditor-oriented \n  training programs, and did not conduct forensic audit training.  \n  \u2022  At one IG, the ministry had conducted no auditor training for IG auditors in several years. \n  \u2022  The number of forensic audits that result in affirmative enforcement or judicial action is \n  insignificant. Little is known as to why the results of forensic audits, referred to judicial \n  authorities, do not result in affirmative enforcement or judicial action. \nFraud  \u2022  Most IGs did not have an adequate system for tracking audit recommendations and thus \ninvestigations  may not be able to efficiently follow up on actions taken with respect to audit \n  recommendations. \nAudit \nrecommendation \nfollow-up. \nInternational  The lack of adherence by IGs to internationally recognized audit standards, as reinforced by \npractice  the evidence presented in this table, argues for the need for major changes in the way IGs \n(benchmarking  manage and execute their audits.  \nPrimary Concern  The primary issue concerning the IGs is whether they should more fully develop the capability \nto independently carry out financial audits in addition to the performance and special-purpose \naudits they conduct. \nIG Inspector Generals \nSource: ADB. 2003. Preparing the Support to State Audit Reform Project. Manila (INO-TA 4107) \n \n \nTable A1.5: Internal Audit: Issues Related to BAWASDAs \n \n Condition   Emerging Issues \nMandate   The regional internal audit institutions, the BAWASDAs, were formed under Laws 32 and \n33, and were strengthened with the subsequent implementing Government Regulations \n84/00, 20/01, and 8/03, and Regulation 105/2000 on Financial Management and \nAccountability in Regions. However, regional laws do not require local regulations to provide \nfor the specific legal and institutional issues. \nOversight  BPK is presumed to exercise some degree of oversight over the BAWASDA audit activities \nit is about to conduct an audit at the BAWASDA level.  \nOperational   \nOverview \nFiscal and other  The amounts budgeted for provincial and regional audits appear to be smaller than their \nResources  estimated needs: the number of regional audits is about 10 times greater than provincial \n  audits, but the amounts budgeted for regional audits is only about three times greater. While \naudit is labor-intensive, only about 50% of the audit budget is for salaries. \n  \u2022  More physical resources, including computers, are needed. The ratio of computers to \nRecruiting  staff members is 1:7 one for every seven staff members at the provincial level, and 1:9 \n  one for every nine at the regional level.  \n  \u2022  The STAR Project was told that training equipment, trained instructors, and training \nSkill and Education  materials were also needed.  \nLevels  \u2022  Many BAWASDA respondents think they are understaffed by more than 3,200 auditors: \n  over 500 at the provincial level, and about 2,700 at the regional level.  \n  \u2022  About 40% of the staff did not go beyond high school.  \n \n\u2022  Only 6% of the staff had academic training in accounting.  \n \n\u2022  Standards issued by BPKP and modified for use were used during some audits. \nStandards \nGuidance issued by MOHA was used during other audits.  \n \n\u2022  BAWASDAs appear not to have either the resources or the skills to complete all their \n \nrequired audits.  \nProductivity  \n\u2022  A survey showed that almost 15% of the provincial audits were either conducted with \nassistance from another audit organization or were not audited.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 1 \n Condition   Emerging Issues \nTraining  \u2022  The total amount budgeted for district and provincial training is an average of 2.1% of \n  the budget, ranging from 2.2% for the districts to 1.9% for the provinces.  \n  \u2022  Eighty-one percent of district respondents and 90% of provincial respondents agreed \n  that financial training was their greatest training need. \nFraud  \u2022  BAWASDA report the results of an audit that indicates the commission of a criminal \nInvestigations  offense to regional government officials without assurance that such matters will receive \n  appropriate police or judicial review. We were advised that the results of fraud \n  investigations are given to the mayor for ultimate disposition.  \n   \n \nInternational  The lack of adequate physical and staff resources, qualified and academically trained \nPractice  accountants, essential training in finance, and complete independence indicates that total \n(benchmarking)  compliance with generally accepted internal audit standards might be unlikely. \nPrimary Concern  The primary issue concerning BAWASDA is whether or not they have the independence, \nrequisite capable staff, facilities, and other resources necessary to fulfill their mandate under \nIndonesia\u2019s decentralization laws (Laws 22/99 and 25/99).  \n \nBAWASDA Regional Government Internal Auditor. \nSource: ADB. 2003. Preparing the Support to State Audit Reform Project. Manila (INO-TA 4107) \n \n4.  Options for BPKP. Based on international practice, the role of BPK as external auditor \nis clear and no alternative scenarios were developed. Likewise, the clear role of the IGs within \nministries also does not warrant the development of alternatives. However, BPKP\u2019s diminished \nrole raises an important question regarding its future role.  \n \n5.  A presentation given at the steering committee meeting on 24 May 2004 included setting \nout the following alternative roles for BPKP that had been brought to the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance project team\u2019s attention by others: \n \n(i)  status quo, \n(ii)  total dissolution or merger with other bodies, and \n(iii)  split central and regional. \n \n6.  Given the considerable expansion of BPK\u2019s responsibilities and its limited resources, it \nseemed to make sense for the Government to consider the reassignment of BPKP\u2019s 25 regional \noffices and over 5,000 staff to BPK. \n \n7.  Should this take place, the question is what role BPKP and its central staff of about \n1,700 could fulfill at the central level of Government. The following suggestions were presented \nfor discussion: \n \n(i)  Pre-audit services for Government. Article 58 of Treasury Law 01/04 requires the \nestablishment of an internal control system, of which pre-audit could be a strong \nelement. \n(ii)  Government support for anticorruption measures. BPKP has contributed to this \neffort by providing expertise and personnel to help conduct investigative audits. \n(iii)  National training center. Given BPKP\u2019s training facilities and experience, it could \nserve as an independent training center for internal auditors. \n(iv)  Service provider. Two aspects were outlined: (a) appointing an internal auditor to \ncentral Government bodies that are too small to warrant establishing their own \ninternal audit function, and (b) providing demand-based internal audit services to \nhelp other internal auditors overcome peak period or specialized needs. Such \nservices would be carried out on a cost-recovery or profit basis. \n \n ", "Appendix 1    33\n8.

\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \n1.  Although good governance in Indonesia has been a key issue for the funding community \nfor some years, the public audit function has not been a priority for assistance. The need for \nstrong fiduciary arrangements has been stressed in the joint Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nWorld  Bank  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment,  and  the  ADB  country \ngovernance assessment carried out in preparation of the Country Strategy and Program for \nIndonesia 2003-2005. Over the past 5 years, a limited amount of external assistance has been \nprovided to help the Government strengthen individual audit organizations, primarily the Audit \nBoard of Indonesia (BPK) and the central government internal auditor (BPKP). However, no \nexternal assistance has been provided to the public sector audit function as a whole. While the \nspecific institution-based capacity-building efforts have been useful, there is also an unmet need \nto establish a clear vision for the future institutional framework for Indonesia\u2019s audit function. \nFurther,  the  significant  changes  and  requirements  brought  about  by  democratization  and \ndecentralization have yet to be addressed. \n \n2.  In summary, the limited amount of external assistance provided to the Government has \nbeen focused on strengthening individual audit organizations, whereas this proposed ADB loan \nis aimed at the public sector audit function as a whole. \n \nTable A3: Past, Ongoing, and Expected Projects \n \nReference  Approval  EA  Amount  Description  Status of \n($ million)  Support for \nAudit  \nAsian Development Bank \nADB 2002.

Over the last 2 years, the Government  of Indonesia (the Government)  has focused on\ncore  areas  of  macroeconomic  reforms.  Fiscal  consolidation  has  received  priority  attention\namong them. The White Paper adopted in September 2003, to smoothen the transition following\nIndonesia's  em  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund-supported  Program,  supported  the\nformulation  of a sound  policy,  institutional,  legal and regulatory framework  to achieve fiscal\nconsolidation.  The Government  and Parliament worked closely to enact three major laws in a\nspan of 15 months: the State Finance Law (Law 17/2003), the State Treasury Law (Law 1/2004)\nand the State Audit Law (Law 15/2004). The aim of these laws is to promote fiscal responsibility\nand enhance accountability  and transparency in public financial management.\n2.  Concurrently,  the  Government  has been working closely with the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  in operationalizing  the  new legal and regulatory framework  for the  Public Audit\nfunctions.  With the support provided under a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA),\nan  inter-agency  Steering  Committee  established  by  the  Government  has  assessed  the\nstrengths  and weaknesses  of state audit institutions in Indonesia. Our premise in undertaking\nsuch  an  assessment  jointly  with  the  ADB  is  that  efficient  and  well-structured  state  audit\ninstitutions  are an  integral  part of an effective  and well functioning  accountability  framework\nincluding  the executive,  Parliament,  and civil society. As an ex post exercise on public sector\nmanagement,  audit  provides  an  independent,  objective  and  a  professionally  conducted\nassessment  on the veracity, accuracy. credibility I and reliability of information on the economy \nI\neffectiveness,  and efficiency of Government.  State auditing arrangements need sound external\naudit (reporting to the legislature) and internal audit (reporting to the executive) functions.\n3.  By way  of  background,  in  Indonesia,  the  Badan  Pemeriksa  Keuangan  (BPK) is the\nexternal  auditor  and  Indonesia's  Supreme  Audit  Institution  (SAI).  For  internal  audit,  at the\ncentral level of government,  there is the Inspectorate General (IG) in each ministry that reports\ndirectly  to the  minister.  At  the  same time  there  is also Badan Pengawasan  Keuangan dan\nPembangunan  (BPKP)  that  reports  directly  to  the  President  but  outside  of  any  particular\nministry. At the regional government level, regional internal audit agencies (Bawasdas) report to\nthe respective chief executive.  In 2001, amendments to the Indonesian Constitution significantly\nexpanded  BPK's  mandate,  to cover virtually the entire public sector at the central as well as\nlocal government  levels.\n4.  Public  sector  audit  institutions  require  a  number of critical  attributes  to promote the\noverall objective  of fiscal transparency  and accountability  at ex ante as well as ex post levels.\nAmong  these  are:  a  strong  legal  and  institutional  framework;  adequate  capacity  in  the\ninstitutions  commensurate  with  their  mandate;  an  efficient  allocation  of  resources  between\nt.", "Appendix  5 45\ndifferent institutions;  effective oversight by Parliament and follow up by the Executive; and full\n. transparency  in the  audit  process.  While  Indonesia  has  had  experience  with  public sector\nauditing for several  decades,  our assessment  as part of the  PPTA   has shown that some of\nthese attributes were lacking in Indonesia.\n5.  The  Government  has  made  a  conscious  attempt  to  address  some  of  the  legal\nweaknesses through the adoption of the 3 major laws that I have outlined in para.1 above. It is\nthe Government's  understanding that there are efforts within the Parliament as well as the BPK\nto strengthen the legal framework for BPK. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), in line with its\nauthority  to ensure  overall  public  sector financial  accountability,  shall  be the coordinator on\nbehalf of the Executive to liaise with Parliament in the adoption of a revised BPK Law.\n6.  In  order  to  address  the  other  areas  of weaknesses  in our  auditing  framework,  the\nGovernment  requested ADB to formulate a Sector Development Program. We appreciate that\n~\nADB has worked  closely  with the Government over the past year to formulate the proposed\nState  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (STAR-SDP).  The  Government  team\nendorses the overall goal of the proposed program, which is to enhance governance, and the\nefficiency,  economy  and  effectiveness  of  public  sector  audit  through  strengthened  audit\ninstitutions operating to internationally accepted standards. Based on our discussions with ADB,\nwe  have  agreed  that  the  objectives  of the  Program will  be:  an  improved  policy  and legal\nframework for state audit institutions; a strengthened and efficiently aligned operating framework\nfor external and internal audit; enhanced accountability and oversight of the public audit function\nat all levels of government;  and increased public awareness of the benefits of audit and what it\ncan deliver.\n7.  The fundamental  principles on which the STAR-SOP is based are critical to note, from\nthe Government's  point of view: (i) a clear delineation between the intemal and external audit\ninstitutions  and  functions;  (ii)  the  restructuring  of  the  audit  institutions  and  functions,  to\nrecognize  and  align  them  with  the  ongoing  decentralization  process;  (iii) the elimination of\noverlap  in the  mandates  of the  public sector  audit  institutions; and  (iv) the achievement of\noverall cost efficiency.\n8.  In line with these principles, the Government  has agreed that the policy component of\nthe SOP should  focus on: (i) rationalization of the policy, legal and regulatory framework for\nstate audit institutions;  (ii) alignment  and provision of resources to enable audit institutions to\nfulfill their mandate; (iii) enhanced oversight on audit recommendations and of the audit function\nat the central and regional level; and (iv) enhanced transparency and public awareness of the\nstate audit function at the central and regional levels.\n9.  The government  is particularly  cognizant  of the need to strengthen  the external and\ninternal audit functions  at the regional level. The Government accepts the need to expand the\npresence  of  BPK  as the  external  auditor  in  line with the  2002  constitutional  amendments.\nFurther, the Government  is aware of the stipulation in the State Finances Law for BPK to audit\nthe  accountability  statements  of all the  regional  governments  beginning  with the fiscal year\n2006. At the same time the Govemment is also aware of redundancy in the central internal audit\ninstitutions,  following  the  creation  of  the  Bawasda,  and  the  latter  will  necessitate  a\ncomprehensive review of the current institutional arrangement in intemal audit in order to ensure\nan effective and cost efficient utilization of resources in the audit sector. The Government has\nestablished an interministerial  committee to look into the intemal control systems, which will,\namongst  other  matters,  look  into  and  make  recommendations  on  the  optimal  institutional\narrangements for internal audit at the regional level. A Govemment regulation will be produced\nthat will delineate the need for further Govemment decrees on this matter.", "46 Appendix 5\n10.  Mr. Chino, through this letter outlining our development policy in the state audit sector,\nthe Government  indicates its strong commitment to pursuing all the reform measures outlined in\nthe Policy Matrix {Attachment  1}. Through these measures, the Government aims to achieve the\nmilestones  in the White  Paper. We believe the adoption of the 3 framework  laws has set the\ntone for reforms to enhance the quality of internal controls within the public sector. The other\nlegal, regulatory  and institutional  measures to be achieved as part of STAR-SOP will improve\nthe  quality  of  external  oversight  and  the  level  of  public  participation  relative  to  fiscal\ntransparency.  More importantly,  it will help the Government address the over-riding concerns\nwith regard to the misalignment  of resources. This would be in line with the Government's focus\non fiscal consolidation  as a priority  area, as part of which we have increasingly  stressed the\nimportance  of sound  public expenditure  management to ensure fiscal sustainability  and reap\npublic sector efficiency  gains  and budgetary savings. The Investment Component  of the SOP\nwill  help  enhance  the  public  sector  audit capacity  and  improve the quality  of the oversight\nprocess significantly.\n11.

No \nanalysis?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nPoor governance is recognized as a key obstacle to poverty reduction in Indonesia. Poverty reduction has been \npersistently slow following the financial crisis and remains at near 1996 levels.1 Following decentralization in 2001, \nlocal government became the principle agent for poverty reduction and achieving of millennium development goals \n(MDGs). Local governments are responsible for delivery of most basic services required by the poor.2 The principal \ninstrument used by local government is the budget, but inadequate safeguards, including the audit framework, \nprevent its effective use.  \n \nThe Government is preparing a poverty reduction strategy.3 The draft paper calls recognizes weak governance as \none of the primary cause of poverty and calls for efficient and service-oriented government and pro-poor \nbudgeting.  The  Government-ADB  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  also  recognized  the  need  to \n\u201cenhance local government transparency, accountability to reflect local aspirations and needs.\u201d  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nThe STARSDP addresses the key obstructions to poverty reduction by enabling central and local governments to \neffectively plan, budget, and deliver poverty reduction initiatives by rationalizing the audit framework, strengthening \nthe audit institutions, increasing oversight on audit recommendations and accountability, and increasing public \nawareness of audit results and their meaning.  \n \nReform of the state audit functions ensures provides feedback on budgetary implementation of policy and how to \nincrease its efficiency, prevents and corrects improper use of the budget, and provides information about program \noperations and results for future policy and budget planning. Transparency of audit functions and audit results \nenables the legislature and public to determine whether the Government is delivering on its promises and whether \npolicy platforms have been turned into action.  \n \nThe STARSDP will enable the Government to deliver its mandate more effectively. In itself, the program does not \nreduce poverty, but it establishes a fundamental basis for accountability in the public sector. Other concomitant \nefforts such as preparation of local poverty reduction strategies raise poverty awareness within government and \ncivil society to ensure the pro-poor content of that mandate. \n \n \nC.

With over 13,000 and more than 220 million citizens, the Republic of Indonesia is the \nworld\u2019s largest archipelago and the fourth most populous nation. Indonesia is divided into 30 \nprovinces and over 400 districts. Average population per province is slightly less than 7 million, \nand about 0.5 million per district. However, there are significant variations: the province of \nGorontalo has less than 1 million people, while East Java is home to over 35 million; and \ndistricts show variability between 20,000 to over 4 million. \n \n2  At present there is no universal approach among the external funding agencies on the \nselection of districts though there is general agreement conceptually that, to varying degrees \ngood governance, competition and selectivity must be part of that process. There are at present \nno standard governance filters, and there is discussion as to whether it is possible to establish \nnationwide governance filters. It is also recognized that given that decentralization is still at a \nnascent  phase  technical  assistance  support  may  be  required  so  as  not  to  exclude  those \nregional  governments  who  have  the  desire  but  not  the  resources  to  achieve  the  desired \ngovernance standard for further support.  \n \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently utilizing the above principles to design a \nmore robust regional selection framework as part of the second tier filter. A draft paper has been \nprepared  and  some  staged  criteria  have  been  developed.  The  draft  also  reviewed  and \nincorporated elements of the current World Bank selection framework and its application in two \nproposed investment projects. The STARSDP incorporated the key elements of the above and \nwill identify districts utilizing the elements in Table A14.1 below in the following way. \n \nTable A14.2: STARSDP Criteria for Selection of Regional Governments \n \nPhase  Detailed Requirements  Verification/Support \nIdentification  Regions  to  be  selected  having  strong  MOHA-IG to  \nPhase  support  from  the  head  of  regions  to  (i) Advertise the STAR SDP project highlighting \nstrengthen  Bawasda  functions.
