This  will  be  achieved  through  the \nimplementation  of  an  integrated  approach  that  provides  a  well-balanced  mix  of  structural  and \nnonstructural interventions, including capacity building.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn step with the rapid economic growth that has taken place since 1985, a large number \nof  people  and  assets  have  accumulated  on  floodplains  in  the  PRC.  As  a  result,  the  PRC  is \nfacing  more  damaging  floods  along  with  serious  environmental  consequences.  Projected \nclimate change impacts will likely exacerbate this trend by increasing the frequency and severity \nof flooding, as seen in the flood disaster that occurred in July 2016 in the Yangtze River basin \n(YRB), the second most expensive natural disaster in the PRC\u2019s history.3 Unlike past disasters, \nthe July 2016 flood caused loss and damage in small watersheds, which the Government of the \nPRC had not prioritized for investment. Cities\u2019 master plans in the PRC do not sufficiently use \nan  integrated  flood  and  environmental  management  (FEM)  approach  that  considers  hazards, \nexposure, vulnerability, and capacity. The government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  lending  support  to  demonstrate  integrated  and  climate-resilient  FEM \nharmonized  with urban planning  in  Xinyu City  in  the  Kongmu  River  watershed. The request  is \nconsistent with the recently released outline of the YRB economic belt master plan, which highly \nprioritizes environmental protection, water management, and flood risk reduction. \n \n4. \nXinyu  City  is  a  new  industrial  city  located  in  Jiangxi  Province  and  had  1.17  million \ninhabitants (63.4% rural and 36.6% urban) in 2015. A significant portion of the city is situated on \nthe Kongmu River watershed, a small watershed 500 square kilometers in size in the Ganjiang \nRiver sub-basin in the YRB. Various locations in Xinyu City along the Kongmu River experience \nannual floods due to low flood control and retention capacities. From 2001 to 2016 eight severe \nflood events were recorded, the worst of which in 2010 forced 78,000 people to evacuate and \ndestroyed over 4,000 homes and 25 square kilometers of crops, causing $116 million in direct \neconomic damage. Xinyu City also suffered major historical floods in 1953, 1955, 1962, 1977, \n1982, and 1989. The average annual damage due to floods in Xinyu City is $54 million.4 \n \n5. \nThe  project  is  located  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed,  which  covers  three \ntownships  (Guanchao,  Ouli,  and  Xiacun)  and  a  new  subdistrict  in  Yushui  District  within  Xinyu \nCity.5 In  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed,  35  villages  currently  house  109,580  people,  of \nwhom 55,762 reside in river corridors in the project area. Most are exposed to floods and lack \naccess to modern wastewater and solid waste facilities, a factor that exacerbates flooding and \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical assistance  for  preparing  the  Jiangxi  Xinyu  Kongmu  River Watershed \n\nFlood Protection and Environmental Improvement Project (TA 8930-PRC).  \n\n3   The  July  2016  flood  caused  $28  billion  in  damage  in  the  YRB.  Aon.  Investor  News.  http://ir.aon.com/about-\n\naon/investor-relations/investor-news/default.aspx. \n4   Calculated from Xinyu City flood disaster information. \n5   The XCG is developing a new subdistrict to (i) cater to its rapidly expanding population and industries, and (ii) take \n\nadvantage of new business opportunities created by a new high-speed railway station. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iv)  undertake  environmentally \n\nwater  quality  degradation  in  both  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  and  downstream  Xinyu \nCity. Inhabitants of the upper Kongmu River watershed suffer from flash floods that develop with \nlittle warning, giving them insufficient time to save valuables and evacuate timely. Approximately \n94% of villagers obtain water from springs and shallow wells, only 6% have access to tap water, \nabout 77% use public or pit toilets, and 23% have indoor flush toilets connected to septic tanks.  \n \n6. \nCurrent  inhabitants  of  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  are  mostly  farmers  with  an \naverage annual income of $1,4096 and average land holding size of 1.2 mu.7 Yushui District, in \nthe  Kongmu  River  watershed,  has  9,541  inhabitants  and  a  poverty  rate  of  2.7%.  The  newly \nplanned subdistrict will have a population of 57,500 by 2020 and 130,000 by 2030. Xinyu City is \nrequired  to  (i)  manage  its  environment,  (ii)  safeguard  ecological  security,  (iii)  improve  water \nmanagement,  and \nfriendly  and  climate-resilient  urban \ndevelopment to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities to both upstream and downstream \ncommunities.   \n \n7. \nUnintegrated  rural  and  urban  flood  management.  Approximately  8,000  people \ncurrently live in areas highly prone to flash flood hazards in the upper Kongmu River watershed, \nwithout  flood  control  infrastructure  or  an  early  warning  system.  The  rest  of  the  people  in  the \nwatershed\u2019s 35 villages are exposed to riverine floods. The new subdistrict is exposed to flash, \nriverine, and urban floods, and may exacerbate downstream flooding by increasing stormwater \nrunoff  due  to  land  use  changes.  If  a  flood  similar  in  size  to  the  2010  flood  occurs  in  the \nwatershed again, it would create $185 million in damage. By 2030, flood damage would reach \n$589  million  with  ongoing  development,  and  $677  million  with  development  in  an  adverse \nclimate change scenario.  \n \nThe Kongmu River watershed has six existing small lakes, which are not used for flood \n8. \nretention due to their low level outlets and sedimentation caused by adjacent farming practices. \nThe  Baiyun  reservoir,  which  supplies  water  to  Xinyu  City,  is  running  at  only  0.7  million  cubic \nmeters (m3) of its full capacity (4.2 million m3) due to operational restrictions imposed by riverine \nand backwater flooding. This has hindered the targeted level of flood control in the downstream \nXinyu City by 50% in a 10-year return period, and 5% in a 50-year return period.  \n \n9. \nInadequate management of wastewater and solid waste. Pollutant levels in all lakes \nand  tributaries  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  exceed  national  standards  due  to \ndomestic  wastewater  discharge,  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  and  the  inefficient \ncollection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste.  The  existing  combined  sewer  and  stormwater  pipeline \nnetwork in Xinyu City is designed for small storm events not exceeding a 2-year return period; \nyet, over 50-year return period events have already occurred in the city since 2007, resulting in \nan overflow of untreated wastewater into the river. The upper watershed generates over 39 tons \nof  solid  waste  per  day;  this  is  projected  to  increase  to  66  tons  per  day  by  2020.  The  new \nsubdistrict will further strain solid waste and wastewater management by producing 150 tons of \nsolid  waste  and  12,500  m3  of  wastewater  per  day  by  2020.  Xinyu  City  lacks  a  proper  waste \ncollection  and  transportation  system. 8 The  main  source  of  drinking  water  for  Xinyu  City  is \nlocated  downstream  of  these  villages  and  the  proposed  subdistrict.  Without  improving  waste \nmanagement  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  these  issues  will  increase  flood  and \nenvironmental risks in the Kongmu River watershed and threaten Xinyu City residents\u2019 drinking \nwater supply.   \n                                                \n6  These  data  are  from  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n\nconsultant team in 2016 and from the 2014 Xinyu and Jiangxi Province statistical yearbooks. \n\n7   A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n8   The wastewater and solid waste from the project area will be treated in the existing Xiacun wastewater treatment \n\nplant and Xinyu solid waste incineration plant, both of which are located in Yushui District. \n\n\f3 \n\nStrategic  fit.  For  the  implementation  of  the  outline  of  the  YRB  economic  belt  master \n\nInsufficient  flood  and  environmental  risk  management  capacity.  The  XCG\u2019s \n10. \ninvestment  has  not  yet  been  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  damage  due  to  high  levels  of  hazards, \nexposure, and vulnerability to floods. Despite several large flood events, flood hazard mapping \nand  risk  mapping  have  not  yet  been  done,  as  the  city  development  plans  do  not  use  risk \nmapping  and  climate-sensitive  land-use  planning  sufficiently.  Levels  of  awareness  and \npreparedness, and the response capacities of local governments and communities are low. The \ncentralized  flood  forecasting  system  does  not  cover  the  communities  in  the  upper  Kongmu \nwatershed. The Kongmu River watershed has no rain gauge and only a few water-level gauge \nand  water  quality  monitoring  stations.  The  present  flood  forecasting  system  relies  on  rainfall \ndata from adjacent river basins, which is not a sound approach due to the highly heterogeneous \nspatial  distribution  of  rainfall  in the  region. To aid flash flood forecasting in the  upper  Kongmu \nRiver  watershed,  additional  hydrological  observation  stations  and  different  flood  modeling \ntechniques  are  required.  The  integrated  FEM  approach  is  yet  to  be  embedded  in  the  city\u2019s \nmaster plan. \n \n11. \nplan, the project will timely demonstrate the new benchmarks for investment in FEM. \n \n12. \nThe project also contributes to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious and prosperous \nsociety through environmentally sustainable growth, and is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  highlights  the  importance  of  flood  risk  management,  and \nwater  pollution  control.9 The  project  also  contributes  to  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020,  of  which  three  of  the  five  main  principles\u2014(i) \nmanaging climate  change  and  environment, (ii)  supporting inclusive economic growth,  and  (iii) \nfostering  knowledge  cooperation\u2014are  reflected  well  in  the  proposed  project.10 The  project  is \nalso  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which  emphasizes \nintegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  with  focus  on  water-related  disaster  risk \nmanagement;11 and (ii) sustainable development goals 6, 11, and 13.12   \n \nLessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed projects \n13. \nand policy-oriented studies on IWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and \nlake management and restoration, and urban\u2013rural integration in the PRC.13 Lessons from past \nand  ongoing  ADB  support  in  the  PRC  for  the  water  sector  include  (i)  nonstructural  measures \nand  community  participation,  (ii)  continuous  O&M  with  sustainable  financial  sources,  and  (iii) \nmanagement and data information systems for IWRM decision-making. Other lessons reflected \nin  the  project  design  are  (i)  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  contributing  to \n\n                                                \n9   Xinhuanet. \n\n2015.

This output will include (i) increased flood retention capacity in the upper Kongmu \nRiver watershed through (a) stormwater management (including rainwater interception), and (b) \nthe  improvement  and  regulation  of  small  lakes  for  FEM;  and  (ii)  flood  protection  along  the \nKongmu River through the construction of levee- and water-regulating structures.  \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Solid waste and wastewater management systems improved. This output \nwill include (i) the construction of a wastewater collection network separate from the stormwater \ncollection  network,  which  will  improve  water  quality  by  reducing  sewerage  overflows;  (ii)  the \nimprovement of the solid waste management system, which will reduce the export of solid waste \ninto  waterways  yielding  both  water  quality  and  flooding  benefits;  and  (iii)  the  construction  of \nwetlands in the lakes, canals, and Kongmu River to treat stormwater runoff and improve water \nquality. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Flood  and  environmental  risk  management  capacity  enhanced.  This \noutput will include (i) capacity development for FEM; (ii) the preparation of a land-use plan and \nbuilding  regulations  based  on  flood  risk  mapping;  (iii)  nonstructural  measures  to  reduce \nresidents\u2019 vulnerability, such as early flood warning, flood proofing, and contingency plans; (iv) \nclimate  change  monitoring  to  reduce  uncertainty  in  flood  risk  design;  (v)  water  quality \nmonitoring; (vi) the establishment of community-based FEM; and (vii) the development of a river \nbasin model to aid river basin planning.    \n \n18. \nSpecial  features  and  value  addition.  The  project  is  timely  in  the  wake  of  the  recent \nflood  disaster  and the  preparation  and  implementation of  the  YRB  economic  belt master  plan. \nThe project will demonstrate in-country best practices and establish new performance standards \nand good practices for investment in FEM. It will also provide a conducive opportunity for new \ndialogue,  regional  cooperation,  and  ADB\u2013PRC  collaboration  for  responding  to  flood  risk \nmanagement and climate variability. \n \n19. \nThe  project  adopts  integrated  flood-resilient  development  planning  to  maximize  flood \ncontrol and strengthen environmental outcomes.14 This includes innovative structural measures \nlike  multifunctional  levees,15 underground  stormwater  storage,  sponge  city  construction,16 and \ninterconnected flood storage lakes.17 \n\n                                                \n14 The  project  will  implement  a  number  of  measures  that  will  serve  both  flooding  and  environmental  needs.  The \nproject will improve water quality, largely mitigate flooding in the project area by capturing almost 75% of the peak \nsurface runoff, and reduce annual average flood damage in downstream Xinyu City by $5.36 million. \n\n15 The  levee  will  protect  three  villages  in  the  project  area  from  both  riverine  and  backwater  floods,  allowing  the \nreservoir  to  operate  at  full  capacity  (securing  an  additional  3.5  million  m3)  and  also  reducing  flood  peaks \ndownstream. \n\n16 A city planning and design approach to absorb rainfall and surface runoff aims to reduce stormwater (urban floods) \nand polluted runoffs and use  this water in eco-friendly ways. The design techniques include permeable surfaces, \ngardens, rainwater harvesting, green spaces, and lakes. \n\n17 The existing six small lakes will be interconnected by canals with structures that can regulate the water levels in the \n\nlakes and also retain water in the canals to best optimize flood control. \n\n\f5 \n\nComplementary  nonstructural  measures  include  (i)  flood  early  warning  systems;  (ii) \n20. \ncommunity-based  FEM;18 and  (iii)  flood-sensitive  development  planning,  including  upstream\u2013\ndownstream  linkages  and  rural\u2013urban  integration. 19 Flood  risk  mapping  will  enhance  spatial \nplanning and be further operationalized by the issuance of regulations on land use, river corridor \ndevelopment, and solid waste management; and building standards and codes. These life- and \nasset-saving measures will directly benefit the current inhabitants and the projected population \nof approximately 300,000 by 2030, both within and outside the project area. \n \nD. \n \n21. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $300.39 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The XCG\u2019s \ndomestic  feasibility  studies  are  technically  sound  and  provide  sufficient  information  as  to  the \n\n                                                \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ndesign\u2019s feasibility. All project components were prepared by licensed domestic design institutes \ntaking into account the local geo-physical, socio-economical, and hydro-metrological, as well as \nclimatic conditions and in accordance with consultants\u2019 recommendations, relevant PRC design \nguidelines, and local regulations. The site investigations and field surveys were conducted to aid \nthe  feasibility  study.  The  project  team  (i)  considered  a  range  of  technical  alternatives  such  as \nstormwater  bypass  canal  or  wetlands  to  reduce  pollutants,  construction  of  levees  or  flood \nretention areas, expansion of existing wastewater treatment plant or construction of a new one, \nstandalone early warning system or centralized one, and their technical and economic viability;  \n(ii)  deliberated  ways  to  (a)  maximize  the  beneficiaries  by  planning  and  redesigning  a  multi-\nfunctional levee to increase water supply and flood protection, stormwater retention facilities to \nreduce  flood  impact  in  downstream  area,  expansion  of  early  warning  coverage  by  installing \nadditional  hydrological  monitoring  stations,  and  considering  amenity  spaces  around  existing \nlakes for visitors; and (b) minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iii) optimized \ntimescales  for  project  implementation.  In  close  consultation  with  the  Xinyu  City  Administration \nBureau,  outsourcing  provisions  are  made  for  specialized  O&M  particularly  for  the  highly \ntechnical  project  components  including  the  underground  stormwater  storage,  sewage  pipes, \ngates, and pumps financed by ADB to ensure the investment\u2019s sustainability. International and \nnational  consulting  services  will  ensure  that  lessons  learned  and  best  practices  are  integrated \ninto  the  final  detailed  design  and  applied  during  construction  and  implementation.  Capacity-\nbuilding activities will further strengthen the quality of project implementation. \n \n26. \nClimate  change.  The  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  indicated  that  climate \nchange  impacts  on  water  systems  in  the  Kongmu  River  basin  are  expected  to  be  substantial \nand long-lasting. In the basin,  it is expected that the annual average temperature  will increase \nby 11.2%, and rainfall will increase by 12.0% during 2020\u20132049. The overall design is geared \ntoward  climate  resilience,  and  each  project  component\u2019s  design  incorporates  a  number  of \nadaptation measures, including some based on the ecosystem, to withstand projected increases \nin rainfall intensity and temperatures. These include (i) increasing water systems\u2019 flood retention \nand  drainage  capacity,  (ii)  enhancing  the  design  of  flood  protection  barriers,  and  (iii)  selecting \nclimate-resilient  materials  and  equipment  in  the  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management \nsystems.  Incremental  costs  associated  with  the  above  measures  are  estimated  at  $11.2 \nmillion.22  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nThe  economic  analysis  confirmed  the  economic  viability  of  the  overall  project,  with  an \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.6%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  CNY140.1 \nmillion.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  further  tested  against  the  following  adverse \nscenarios:  a  10%  investment  cost  overrun,  10%  O&M  cost  increase,  10%  benefit  reduction, \n10% urban population growth reduction, and combinations thereof. The results showed that the \nproject\u2019s economic viability is robust in all of these adverse scenarios.  \n \n28. \nFinancial sustainability was assessed based on the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funds \nduring  the  project,  (ii)  O&M  costs,  and  (iii)  loan  repayment  obligations.  The  total  financial \nobligations are less than 2% of the XCG\u2019s annual expenditure, demonstrating that the project\u2019s \nfiscal impact is negligible for the XCG.23 The XCG has sufficient fiscal resources for counterpart \nfunds, O&M costs, and loan repayment obligations.  \n\n                                                \n22 This estimate includes the costs of incremental design and nonstructural measures.  Detailed accounts of climate \ndue diligence and adaptation features can be found in Technical Notes on Climate Change (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n                                           \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nA financial management assessment was conducted for the Xinyu City Finance Bureau \nand  Xinyu  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  Investment  Group  Company  Ltd.  (XURCIG).  The \nproject\u2019s overall financial management risk before considering mitigating measures is moderate. \nThe assessment recommended an action plan, which the XCG will implement during the project \nto mitigate the identified financial management risks. \n \n30. \nAn assessment  of  the  XCG\u2019s  procurement  capacity  confirmed  that  XURCIG,  which will \nconduct all procurement for the project through a procurement agency and with the assistance \nof ADB and consultants, would have adequate procurement capacity to comply fully with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Specific  policy  requirements,  capacity \ndevelopment, and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  XCG,  and  XURCIG.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy \n2011,  the  audit  reports  of  the  project  will  be  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nfor  additional \n\n32. \nA poverty and social assessment was conducted and the following measures have been \nintegrated  in  the  project  design  to  enhance  social  inclusion:  (i)  the  inclusion  of  35  rural  and \nrelatively  poor  villages \nflood  protection  and  environmental  benefits;  (ii) \nstrengthened consultations with local communities and their participation in project planning and \ndesign  and  the  making  of  decisions,  such  as  (a)  the  exclusion  of  six  originally  planned  levee \nstructures and (b) the inclusion of nonstructural measures; (iii) the inclusion of community-based \nflood and environmental risk management as a stand-alone project component; (iv) targeted job \nopportunities for local people; and (v) the sharing of project benefits with affected communities. \nThe project will directly benefit the existing population of 55,762, mostly in Guanchao, Ouli, and \nXiacun,  and  the  projected  populations  of  57,500  (by  2020)  and  130,000  (by  2030)  in  the  new \nsubdistrict. The project will prevent the flooding of homes, contamination of groundwater (which \nis the source of drinking water for most households), and loss of crops and other assets. Of the \nexisting  population  in  the  project  area,  about  47%  are  women  and  3%  are  poor;  most \ninhabitants live in flood-prone areas. Employment opportunities, including 6,500 temporary jobs \n(during  construction)  and  50  permanent  jobs  (during  O&M),  will  be  created  for  local  people. \nFurther consultations will be undertaken during the design and implementation.  \n\n \n\nissues \n\nidentified  during  social  assessments, \n\n33.  While most  project  benefits  are expected to be distributed  equally  to men and women, \nsome  components,  particularly  nonstructural  ones,  are more  likely  to  benefit  women  and  poor \nhouseholds. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project addresses \nkey  gender \nlimited \nrepresentation in decision-making, low levels of awareness and skills, and inadequate job and \nincome  opportunities.  A  gender  action  plan  and  social  development  action  plan  have  been \nprepared comprising the following specific measures targeting women and the poor: (i) involving \nthem  in  public  awareness  campaigns  and  skill  development  training  on  FEM,  public \nconsultations, and the design and implementation of project activities; (ii) employing them during \nconstruction  and  O&M;  (iii)  promoting  project  staff\u2019s  awareness  of  gender  and  social  inclusion \nmeasures;  and  (iv)  collecting  data  disaggregated  by  sex  and  poverty  status  for  implementing \nand  monitoring  the  gender  action  and  social  development  action  plans.  The  PMO  and/or \nimplementing agency will implement and monitor these plans and report their progress to ADB. \n\nincluding  women\u2019s \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  report,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \nhas been prepared and follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).24 The IEE and EMP \nare  based  on  the  approved  domestic  feasibility  study  report  and  environmental  assessments, \nsite visits, and consultations with stakeholders, including with affected persons. The PMO will be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  EMP,  and  will  appoint  qualified  environmental  personnel  to \ncoordinate key tasks, including inspecting, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions \nor  measures.  The  XCG  has  no  prior  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  procedures;  therefore, \nthe project design includes loan implementation consultants and a capacity building program. A \ngrievance redress mechanism (GRM)  has been prepared and comprises a series of steps with \ntime-based actions to ensure that any public concerns are quickly identified and addressed. The \nGRM will be operational within 90 days of the date of project effectiveness. The PMO will lead \nthe GRM\u2019s implementation. The procedures are described in the PAM and project EMP. \n \nThe  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits  through  a  comprehensive \n35. \ngreen planning approach. Design targets include (i) capturing 75% of annual runoff (to improve \nflood control), (ii) a 40% reduction in stormwater pollutant loads, (iii) provision of sanitary sewer \nconnections for over 57,000 people, (iv) almost 100% coverage for solid waste collection in two \nsettlements, (v) new public green spaces, (iv) improved quality of life, and (vii) improved water \nresources management.  Anticipated  construction  impacts  include temporary  soil  erosion,  dust, \nand noise within modified habitats in a wetland park. Operational risks include the discharge of \ntreated  stormwater  upstream  of  drinking  water  inlets  in  the  Baiyun  reservoir.  Risks  were \naddressed  through  an  integrated  approach  for  project  design  and  safeguards,  including  the \nremoval  of  large  levees  and  other  features,  such  as  river  dredging,  from  the  early  designs, \nwhich  significantly  avoided  the  increased  flow  velocity  and  associated  erosions  and  water \npollution.  Mitigation  measures  include  performance  testing  of  the  constructed  wetlands, \nleachate control at waste transfer stations, and the protection and monitoring of water quality at \nwater inlets. The IEE concluded that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed \ntraining, will result in residual impacts within the PRC\u2019s standards as defined in the EMP. \n \ninvoluntary \n36. \nresettlement. The project will permanently acquire 2,290.48 mu of collective land and demolish \n24,657.06  square  meters  of  housing  in  two  towns,  one  subdistrict,  and  five  villages  with  13 \nvillage  groups.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  1,078  households  and  3,693  persons.  House \ndemolition  will  affect  56  households,  with  287  persons  requiring  relocation  of  their  houses.  A \nresettlement plan has been prepared based on the feasibility study in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  and  related  national  laws  and  regulations.  The  resettlement  plan  includes \nadequate compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation measures to restore affected persons\u2019 \nliving  standards,  including  a  budget,  an  implementation  schedule,  external  and  internal \nmonitoring,  and  a  GRM.  Affected  persons  have  been  consulted  for  the  resettlement  plan  and \nthey support the project. They will be consulted further during the updating and implementation \nof  the  resettlement  plan.  The  total  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost,  estimated  at \nCNY273.97  million,  is  fully  included  in  the  project  budget.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  have  the  capacity  and  experience  to  implement  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nunder  domestic  projects.  The  project  will  further  strengthen  the  capacity  of  these  agencies \nthrough  staff  training  and  consultant  support  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  in  line  with \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project \n\nis  classified  category  A  for \n\n                                                \n24 Initial  Environmental  Examination  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  IEE  was \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  22  September  2016  (https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-jiangxi-xinyu-\nkongmu-river-watershed-flood-control-iee). \n\n                                           \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  The  PMO  will  engage  an  external  monitor  to  keep  track  the \nprogress of the resettlement plan\u2019s implementation and submit quarterly monitoring reports. \n \n37. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The project  is  classified  category  C for  indigenous  peoples. The \nproject  does  not  involve  any  distinct  ethnic  minority  community  and  thus  does  not  trigger \nrequirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.
