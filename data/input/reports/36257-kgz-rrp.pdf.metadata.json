It  connects  to  the  Bishkek-Osh  road,  a  vital  national \ntransport  corridor  that  is  being  rehabilitated  under  ongoing  projects \nfinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  to  Almaty  and \nother  cities  in  Kazakhstan.  The  road  also  connects  to  the  road  to \nDushanbe,  a  section  of  which  is  being  rehabilitated  under  an  ongoing \nto  Afghanistan. \nADB-financed  project, \nThe  Project  includes  improvement  of  about  124  kilometers  (km)  of  the \nroad  (Osh-Gulcha-Sopu  Korgon);  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  and  procurement  of \nthe  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nmaintenance  equipment \nIrkeshtam road. \n \nThe Project will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the \nKyrgyz  Republic  by  rehabilitating  a  section  of  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nIrkeshtam  road,  which  will  extend  the  rehabilitated  Bishkek  to  Osh \ncorridor  further  into  the  southern  region  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  to \nneighboring  countries.  The  Project  will  foster  regional  cooperation  by \nrehabilitating a key transport corridor linking the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, \nand  Uzbekistan.  The  project  road  links  the  population  and  production \ncenters  of  Uzbekistan's  part  of  the  Fergana  Valley  and  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous Region in the PRC. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce \npoverty  by  improving  the  transport  network  and  by  increasing  regional \ntrade  and  cooperation  through  rehabilitation  of  the  road  linking  the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan. The Project will reduce the cost \nof road transport and improve access to markets for people living along \nthe road. \n \nThe total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$43.4  million  equivalent,  of  which  $24.5  million  (56%)  is  foreign \nexchange cost and $18.9 million (44%) equivalent is local currency cost.\n \n \n \n\nto  maintain \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\niii\n\n($ million)\nTotal \nCost \n32.8 \n6.6 \n4.0 \n43.4 \n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n24.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n24.5 \n\nTotal \n\n8.3 \n6.6 \n4.0 \n18.9 \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nThe OPEC Fund  \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nA loan of SDR 22,272,000 ($32.8 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard \nterms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Special  Funds  resources. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of \n8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% during the remaining period.  \n \nUntil 31 March 2009. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n30 September 2008. \n\n \nA project implementation unit (PIU) will be established to implement the \nProject.  The  PIU  head  will  be  supported  by  9  professional  and  clerical \nstaff  with  expertise  and  experience  in  financial  accounting,  road \nengineering,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  administration. \nThe PIU will be established and made operational prior to the award of \nthe civil works contracts. \n \n\n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and  $1.0  million  for  civil  works  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Supply contracts not \nexceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping. \nCivil  works  are  packaged  in  three  contracts;  two  will  be  financed \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  one  will  be \nfinanced  using  local  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  for  the \nequipment  are  packaged  in  two  contracts  to  be  financed  following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Advance  procurement \naction for civil works was approved on 13 July 2004.  \n \nInternational consulting services for 57 person-months will  be provided \nby  a  firm  for  construction  supervision,  project  impact  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  implementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety, \nauditing,  and  project  management.  The  international  consultants  will \nalso  provide  on-the-job  training  to  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic \nconsultants.  In  association  with  the  international  consultants,  domestic \nconsulting  services  totaling  500  person-months  will  be  provided  for \n\n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) \n \nProcurement \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nto \n\nthe \n\ntimes  due \n\nfor  assisting \n\nin  road  closing \n\nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical \nadvisory  assistance;  as  well  as \ninternational \nconsultants  in  monitoring  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the  Project \nthrough  household  surveys  and  data  analysis.  The  consultants  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nto select the consultants.  \n \nThe Project will promote economic growth by increasing regional trade \nand traffic along the project road. The Project will reduce transport costs \nfor  residents  in  the  project  area  and  improve  access  to  (i)  markets  for \nagricultural  goods,  (ii)  employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  social \nservices. The poverty incidence in the project area is 49%, higher than \nthe national level of 41%. The primary economic benefits of the Project \nare vehicle operating cost savings for normal traffic, generated domestic \ntraffic,  reduction \nimproved  winter \nmaintenance,  benefits  from  increased  agricultural  income,  and  border-\ncrossing  fees.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  such  as  time \nsavings, improved road safety, and improved access to social services, \nwhich have not been quantified. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe  Project  including  only  benefits  accruing  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is \n13.3%. The groups receiving the largest shares of the benefits are the \neconomy/Government  and  freight  users,  mostly  in  the  private  sector. \nDue  to  the  competitive  nature  of  the  markets  for  transport  services  in \nthe  project  area,  most  of  the  benefits  from  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings  will  be  passed  on  to  transport  users.  The  Project  will  also \ngenerate  benefits  from  international  generated  and  diverted  traffic, \nwhich  will  accrue  to  the  PRC,  Uzbekistan,  and  other  countries  in  the \nregion. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks.  To  mitigate \npotential  delays  in  implementation,  the  detailed  design  has  been \ncompleted  and  advance  action  has  been  approved.  MOTC  has \nextensive experience with ADB procedures, and procurement activities \nare  already  under  way.  Given  the  high  priority  that  the  Government \nassigns to the Project, the Government will make every effort to ensure \nthe  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds.  The  traffic  forecast  may  not \nfully  materialize,  especially \ntraffic \ncontributing to the border crossing fees, as obstacles to trade and traffic \nmoving across the border between the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan \nmay  continue  to  be  a  problem.  To  address  this  risk,  the  advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the corridor includes facilitation of regional \ncooperation  and  development  of  a  regional  agency  to  manage  the \noverall transport corridor. Another risk is that project roads may not be \nproperly maintained and thus the full benefits of the Project will not be \nrealized.  The  project  design  includes  elements  to  address  the  risks  of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the \nproject  roads.  The  cross-border  fees  collected  on  the  project  road  will \nbe  used  to  finance  maintenance  of  the  project  road  and  other  roads \n\ninternational  generated \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nunder  MOTC  jurisdiction.  The  advisory  TA  will  help  develop  a \nmaintenance  strategy,  and  the  Project  includes  procurement  of  road \nmaintenance equipment, solely for use on the project road. \n \nThe  TA  for  Improving  Road  Maintenance  and  Strengthening  the \nTransport  Corridor  Management  Department,  for  $800,000  equivalent, \nwill  be  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  and  update  the  corridor \nanalysis,  including  traffic  projections  and  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts;  (ii)  help  MOTC  establish  the  corridor  department  institutional \nstructure and the corridor regional executive management agency; and \n(iii) help MOTC develop systems for setting and collecting tolls, financial \nmanagement, maintenance management, procurement of maintenance \nequipment, and traffic facilitation. \n \nThe  TA  for  Awareness  and  Prevention  for  HIV/AIDS,1  Sexually \nTransmitted Infections, and Human Trafficking, for $500,000 equivalent, \nwill  be  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will mitigate potential negative impacts of \nthe  Project  through  education  campaigns,  training  for  health  workers \nand border guards, workshops and policy development, and monitoring. \nThe  TA  will  focus  on  construction  workers,  sex  workers,  road  users, \nhealth workers, officials, and border guards in the project area. \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Southern  Transport  Corridor  Road  Rehabilitation  Project;  and  (ii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by the \nOPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  for  the  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  (i)  Improving  Road  Maintenance  and  Strengthening  the  Transport \nCorridor  Management  Department,  and  (ii)  Awareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,1  Sexually \nTransmitted  Infections  (STIs),  and  Human  Trafficking,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nThe Project will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic by \nrehabilitating a section of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road, which will extend the rehabilitated \nlink  from  Bishkek  to  Osh  further  into  the  southern  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  also  to  neighboring \ncountries. The Project  will foster regional cooperation by rehabilitating the key transport corridor \nlinking the Kyrgyz Republic, People's Republic of China (PRC), and Uzbekistan. The Government \nconsiders improvement of the project road (Osh-Gulcha-Sopu Korgon road) as one of its highest \npriorities  and  an  important  part  of  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  The  Government \nrecognizes that improving transport links is essential to increase trade and economic growth, and \nhas officially declared the Project a national priority.2 The feasibility study was conducted as part \nof  ADB\u2019s  regional  TA  on  cooperation  in  transport  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs).3  The \nframework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country, with road transport dominating \nthe  country's  transport  system.  Road  transport  accounted  for  about  94%  of  freight  tonnage \nmovements  and  almost  all  passenger  traffic  (excluding  intraurban)  in  2001.  About  18,900 \nkilometers  (km)  of  roads  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC): 9,900 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads. About 40% of the \nroads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50% are gravel and \nless than 10% are earth roads. About 15,000 km of roads are outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly \nrural and farm roads. The coverage of the road network is generally adequate for the development \nneeds of the country. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion or major upgrading of \nthe transport system, but proper maintenance and rehabilitation to preserve the existing network, \nwhich suffers from widespread deterioration. \n \n4. \nAs  with  most  other  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  economic  crisis  stemming \nfrom  the  breakup  resulted  in  a  decline  in  economic  activity  and  disrupted  customary  trading \npatterns.  The  demand  for  transport  has  fallen  dramatically  since  independence.  In  2001,  freight \nturnover (measured in ton-km) was only 20% of its 1990 level, and passenger turnover was 57% \nof its previous level. The lowest levels were reached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton-\nkm and passenger movements were only 14% and 33% of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting \na sharp decline in real incomes and output. Demand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight transport \ndecreased  again  following  the  1998  financial  crisis  in  the  Russian  Federation.  Growth  of  freight \n\n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  Law of the Kyrgyz Republic No. 72 On Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam Road Rehabilitation Project Priorities. 12 April 2003. \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Regional Cooperation in Transport Projects in Central Asia. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\ntransport  resumed  in  1999.  Passenger  transport  has  been  growing  at  about  6%  annually  since \n1997.  \n \n5. \nThe  Automobile  Roads  Act  gives  the  main  responsibility  for  planning  and  administering \nroad  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC,  which  is  responsible  for  policymaking  and \nregulating,  planning,  and  developing  transport  and  communications  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nincluding  road,  railway,  and  aviation.  The  Department  of  Roads  under  MOTC  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  road  sector.  MOTC's  seven  regional  road  maintenance  agencies,  one  in  each \nprovince, plus the Bishkek-Osh Road Division are responsible for maintaining the state and local \nroads  under  MOTC's  jurisdiction.  The  regional  road  maintenance  agencies  and  Bishkek-Osh \nRoad Division comprise 58 local maintenance units that carry out actual maintenance works. \n \nUntil 1994, transport companies were controlled by a joint stockholding company, Kyrgyz \n6. \nAuto  Transport,  when  Decree  No.  61  abolished  the  company  and  transferred  its  functions  to \nMOTC. Of the total 251 transport enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been privatized, \nprimarily  through  conversion  to  joint-stock  companies.  Of  the  86  companies  currently  providing \nroad transport services, 74 have been privatized. Those that have not been privatized comprise \nurban  bus  enterprises  in  major  cities  and  some  enterprises  connected  with  state  security.  As  a \nresult  of  measures  introduced  by  the  Government  in  1994  to  increase  competition,  most  of  the \nnational  and  provincial  holding  companies  and  associations  (which  had  continued  to  exercise \ncontrol over the operations of individual transport companies) were abolished. Through regulation \nthe  Government  continues  to  have  a  strong  influence  in  the  market  for  intercity  passenger \ntransport. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created  in MOTC in  1994, issues transport licenses and \nregulates  transport  services.  The  market  for  freight  transport  services  is  more  competitive  than \nthat for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions of price \nand quality of service directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate \nand  arrange  intermodal  transport  services,  thus  facilitating  door-to-door  transport  arrangements, \nand  to  offer  services  directly  themselves.  However,  the  Government  also  plays  a  large  role  in \nfreight transport, through regulation. MOTC is responsible for monitoring and regulation, including \nlicensing, inspection, and safety audits. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries of the former Soviet Union, with per \ncapita gross domestic product (GDP) of $377 in 2003. About 41% of the population was estimated \nto  be  living  in  poverty  in  2003  with  about  9%  living  in  nutrition-based  extreme  poverty.4  The \npoverty  level  has  declined  from  its  peak  in  1999,  following  the  Russian  financial  crisis,  of  an \nestimated 55.3% (on a per capita expenditure basis). The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy  is  in  Appendix  3,  and  summary  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The emergence of high levels of poverty in the country can be traced \nto the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in production due \nto the disruption of geographically spread production chains and loss of traditional markets. GDP \ndeclined  by  almost  50%  during  1991\u20131995.  Economic  growth  resumed  in  1996,  although  it  has \nbeen  uneven,  due  to  events  such  as  the  Russian  financial  crisis  of  1998.  Among  the  factors \nresponsible  for  the  continuing  high  levels  of  poverty  is  the  difficulty  of  developing  external  and \ndomestic  markets  for  Kyrgyz  products,  reflecting  the  landlocked  nature  of  country  with  its  trade \nand transit problems, limited natural resources, and the small size of the domestic market. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f  3\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  future  development  is  dependent  on  enhancing  its  access  to \n8. \nregional  markets  and  diversifying  its  exports.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \nemphasizes  the  importance  of  promoting  regional  cooperation  and  improving  transport  links  to \nincrease exports. Regional dimensions and facilitation of trade are therefore important aspects of \ntransport  development.  The  long  distances  to  ocean  ports  and  large  markets  give  even  greater \nimportance  to  developing  an  efficient  transport  system,  including  links  to  other  countries. \nPromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  is  also  a  key  component  of  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive Development Framework to 2010. Regional cooperation is essential to achieving \nthis given the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s small population and landlocked location. The Project will greatly \nfacilitate  increased  regional  trade  and  cooperation.  The  Government  recognizes  the  Project\u2019s \nimportance and has officially declared it as a national priority. \n \nFinancing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate \n9. \nfor  the  country\u2019s  needs.  With  the  assistance  of  an  ADB-financed  TA  for \ninstitutional \nstrengthening,5 the Government passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and, as specified in the loan \ncovenants for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project,6 is collecting road user charges prescribed \nunder  the  act.  According  to  the  act,  a  portion  of  road  revenues  should  be  deposited  into  a \nseparate road fund account. In view of the severe fiscal problems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic in \n2001,  and  as  advised  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (to  meet  its  requirement  for  a \nconsolidated  budget),  ADB  waived  a  loan  covenant  requiring  the  establishment  of  a  separate \ndedicated road fund account, although the collection of road user charges in accordance with the \nRoad  Fund  Act  is  continuing.  At  present,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  makes  annual  allocations  for \nroad  maintenance  and  other  road  sector  expenditures  based  on  overall  budget  considerations. \nThe allocations have been inadequate to meet the sector\u2019s needs. Total Government road-sector \nexpenditures  ranged  from  $5.8  to  $11.4  million  during  2000\u20132003,  peaking  in  2002.  Planned \nGovernment  expenditures  for  2004  and  2005  are  $13.0  and  $9.6  million,  respectively. \nExpenditures  on  road  maintenance  accounted  for  at  least  half  of  the  Government\u2019s  road  sector \nexpenditures during 2000\u20132003, except in 2002. These expenditures increased from about $2.9 \nto $5.4 million during 2000\u20132003, with about $6.5 and $5.3 million per year planned for 2004 and \n2005, respectively. The Project will address the issue of financing for road maintenance through \nuse of border-crossing fees to finance maintenance, development of a new strategy for financing \nroad maintenance, and loan covenants to ensure adequate financing for maintenance. \n \n10. \nThe Government's transport strategy and plans are included in the Transport and Road \nSector  Policy  Statement  prepared  with  assistance  of  ADB  TA  (footnote  5).  The  Government's \noverall policy objectives for transport include (i) adequately maintaining transport infrastructure \nto  support  the  reform  of  the  economy;  (ii)  privatizing  transport  operations  and  promoting \ncompetition  among  operators,  while  addressing  safety  and  environmental  concerns;  and  (iii) \nincreasing  cost  recovery  from  transport  infrastructure  users.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the \nGovernment's  strategy  includes  (i)  increasing  the  financial  provision  for  rehabilitating  and \nmaintaining  the  road  network,  (ii)  consolidating  road  sector  responsibilities  under  MOTC,  and \n(iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance.  The  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  implementing  its  strategy  for  the  road  sector,  and  addressing  the  problems  and \nopportunities related to poverty reduction and road maintenance.  \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  overall  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  Country \nStrategy and Program for the Kyrgyz Republic of reducing poverty by promoting private-sector-led \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n\n\f4 \n \n\neconomic  growth  and  supporting  human  development.  Promoting  regional  cooperation,  with  an \nemphasis  on  trade  and  transport  infrastructure,  is  one  of  the  means  by  which  ADB  aims  to \npromote private-sector-led economic growth. The Project, which is included in ADB\u2019s assistance \nprogram for 2004, shares this objective.  \n \n12. \nADB  is  the  major  provider  of  assistance  ($145  million)  to  the  road  sector  (Appendix  4). \nADB  has  been  intensively  involved  in  rehabilitating  key  sections  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network. \nThe  three  completed  and  ongoing  projects  to  rehabilitate  most  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road, \nimplemented  in  cooperation  with  other  development  agencies,  have  greatly  improved  transport \nbetween the southern and northern regions of the country. In addition, the ongoing ADB-financed \nproject to rehabilitate the road from Bishkek to Almaty improves international links for the northern \nand southern regions to Kazakhstan, which has road links to other major countries of the region. \nThe Project will expand the reach of this improved road corridor, by extending it from Osh toward \nthe  border  with  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  approved  a  $22  million  loan  for  the  Urban  Transport \nProject in 2000 to rehabilitate urban roads in Bishkek, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, and Islamic Development Bank have worked together to rehabilitate the \nBishkek-Osh road. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation provided parallel cofinancing of \n$28  million  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  maintenance  equipment  for  the  road \nrehabilitation  project,7  and  provided  parallel  cofinancing  of  $40.8  million  for  the  Second  Road \nRehabilitation  Project  (footnote  6).  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  approved  two  loans  to \nrehabilitate the Jalal-Abad-Uzgen section of the Bishkek-Osh road and a section of the Suusamur-\nTorugart road. \n \n13. \nLessons Learned. The project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and \nTA operations in general, ADB\u2019s road sector operations in the Kyrgyz Republic, and other projects \nand  TAs  in  the  CARs.  One  of  the  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  impact  evaluation  study  on  roads  and \npoverty reduction8 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened by neglecting \nroad maintenance. The Project is addressing this by requiring specified levels of financing for road \nmaintenance  (for  the  the  project  road  as  well  as  other  roads)  and  purchasing  maintenance \nequipment to be used on the entire corridor including the project road. In addition, the advisory TA \nassociated with the Project will help the Government develop a new road maintenance strategy \nand establish the management department for the project road, which will be responsible for road \nmaintenance. The impact evaluation study also concluded that improved roads are a necessary \nbut  not  sufficient  condition  for  reducing  poverty.  The  Project  is  addressing  this  point  by \ncomplementing  numerous \nincome-generation  and  other  poverty-reduction  projects  being \nimplemented in the project area by ADB and other international agencies (para. 53). \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s TA Performance Audit Report on Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to \nthe  Road  Sector  in  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Mongolia9  found  that  the  scope  of  TAs \nshould be achievable within the given time frame. The report also found that expenditures on road \nmaintenance  in  the  three  CARs  need  to  be  increased.  These  recommendations  have  been \naddressed in the project design by (i) providing a 12-month and 37-month implementation periods \nfor  the  advisory  TAs  on  the  corridor  department  and  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking, \nrespectively, and (ii) loan covenants and development of a new strategy for road maintenance.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1996.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f  5\n\nImplementation  of  ADB-financed  road  sector  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has \n15. \nproceeded satisfactorily; the sector has been one of the best performing. Two of the three ongoing \nroad projects have satisfactory project ratings, and one (the Almaty-Bishkek Road Rehabilitation \nProject10)  is  rated  partly  satisfactory.  The  project  completion  report  for  the  Road  Rehabilitation \nProject  (footnote  7)  rated  the  project  as  successful.  The  main  issue  regarding  implementation \nperformance is delay in implementation. The Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) and \nthe Almaty-Bishkek Road Rehabilitation Project have experienced delays in implementation due \nto delays in procurement, changes in scope of work (including slope rehabilitation), and time taken \nfor  ratification  of  a  cross-border  agreement  between  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \nproposed Project is not expected to encounter such delays as (i) the detailed design pays close \nattention  to  issues  of  slope  rehabilitation,  and  (ii)  MOTC  now  has  significant  experience  in \nprocuring  road  maintenance  equipment.  The  Project  has  been  designed  in  close  coordination \nwith the Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the Government \nhas the financial capability to comply with covenants affecting the budget. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  by \nimproving  the  transport  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  by  increasing  regional  trade  and \ncooperation  by  rehabilitating  sections  of  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  road,  which  links  the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan. The Project will reduce the cost of road transport and \nimprove access to markets for people living along the road. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe scope of the Project includes (i) improving about 124 km of the two-lane highway from \nOsh to Gulcha to Sopu Korgon, (ii) providing consulting services for construction supervision and \nmonitoring and evaluation, (iii) procuring maintenance equipment to maintain the entire Osh-Sary \nTash-Irkeshtam road, and (iv) providing two advisory TAs for (a) improving road maintenance and \nstrengthening the transport corridor management department; and (b) awareness and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking. \n \n18. \nThe project road is mostly a two-lane national highway, with the exception of some four-\nlane sections near Osh. The condition of the road varies widely depending on past maintenance \nactivity and geological conditions. On the first 22 km (near Osh) the road passes through a more \nor less contiguous flat plain; while on the 24\u201330 km section, the road passes through the Taldyk \nRiver floodplain and is subject to bank erosion during the river\u2019s heavier flows. The next section of \nthe road traverses the steep terrain of the Chygyrchyk Pass, on which the alignment rises from an \naltitude of 2,100 meters (m) at km 56 to 2,400 m at km 61, and then drops to 1,550 m at km 80. \nThe section from km 80 to km 124 of the project road passes along the river, on the embankment \nin  the  floodplain,  and  on  the  lower  slopes  of  adjoining  mountains.  The  road  is  vulnerable  to \nerosion  and  landslides  at  many  points,  and  the  bituminous  pavement  has  been  completely  lost \nover several short sections. \n \n19. \nThe Government requested that the Project improve the Osh to Sopu Korgon section (the \nmost populated part of the road), as its improvement will provide the greatest benefits to the local \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2000.

At  the  same  time,  the  PRC-financed \nimprovement works (para. 24) will separately focus on the unpaved section from the PRC-Kyrgyz \nRepublic  border  westward.  The  Project\u2019s  rehabilitation  works,  which  will  vary  according  to \nlocation,  include  surface  overlay,  reinforcement  of  embankment,  slope  rehabilitation  and \nprotection  measures, installation of  drainage systems, safety  facilities, and measures to prevent \nmajor rock falls. In addition, seriously deteriorated bridges will be replaced. All the project works \nhave been designed to comply with the highway design standards developed under ADB\u2019s TA on \nroad design standards in the CARs.11 In addition, the road maintenance equipment to be procured \nunder  the  Project  will  become  the  property  of  MOTC  and  will  be  used  on  the  entire  Osh-Sary \nTash-Irkeshtam road.  \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n \n20. \nThe  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  road  comprises  part  of  the  larger  Tashkent-Osh-Kashgar \ntransport  corridor  that  links  the  Fergana  Valley  in  Uzbekistan  with  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous \nRegion  (Xinjiang)  in  the  PRC,  crossing  through  Osh  and  other  points  in  the  southern  Kyrgyz \nRepublic. Tashkent is about 410 km from Osh; the distance from Osh to Irkeshtam (at the PRC \nborder) is about 260 km; and Kashgar is 240 km east of Irkeshtam. Both the Fergana Valley in \nUzbekistan  and  Xinjiang  in  the  PRC  are  important  and  dynamic  population  and  commercial \ncenters  in  Central  Asia.  The  Fergana  Valley  comprises  approximately  30%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \npopulation and value of retail trade, and is a center of agricultural production. Xinjiang Region is \ndynamic,  with  average  GDP  growth  of  9.0%  during  2001\u20132003,  higher  than  the  national  rate  in \nthe PRC, and population exceeding 19 million.  \n \n21. \nTrade between the PRC and the Kyrgyz Republic has been growing rapidly, and the PRC \nis now the third largest importer of goods from the Kyrgyz Republic. Xinjiang\u2019s imports from the \nKyrygz Republic increased by 26% during 2002-2003, while total trade between them increased \nby  50%.  The  potential  for  continued  rapid  increases  in  trade  is  substantial;  both  countries  have \njoined the World Trade Organization. Improving the transport link between the Fergana Valley and \nXinjiang will greatly facilitate the growth in trade and economic development in the region. There \ncurrently is regional traffic on the project road, even in its deteriorated state. Commodities shipped \non the project road include scrap metal and coal, which are imported by the PRC, and account for \nabout  69%  and  21%  of  the  bilateral  trade  on  the  corridor.  Trade  in  other  commodities,  such  as \nexports of leather hides and wool from the Kyrgyz Republic and exports of consumer goods from \nthe PRC, account for about 10% of cross-border trade. With an improved road, opportunities will \nincrease  for  the  shipping  of  agricultural  produce  from  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan  to \nXinjiang.  ADB  is  also  facilitating  regional  trade  through  the  proposed  Regional  Customs \nModernization  and  Infrastructure  Development  Project  (included  in  ADB\u2019s  program  for  2004), \nunder which communications equipment will be provided for the Kyrgyz Republic border post at \nIrkeshtam on the transport corridor. \n \n22. \nThe Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road has broader regional significance as well. In addition \nto linking these important commercial centers in the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan, the \nroad  also  provides  connections  to  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  to  the  south  and  to  Almaty,  other \ncities in Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation to the north. At Sary Tash (184 km from Osh), \nthere  is  a  junction  with  the  road  leading  to  the  border  with  Tajikistan  and  onward  to  the  capital \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f  7\n\nDushanbe (a section of this road is being rehabilitated under an ADB loan12), and eventually to the \nAfghanistan-Tajikistan  border.  At  Osh,  the  project  road  connects  to  the  Bishkek-Osh  road,  for \nwhich ADB has financed three road rehabilitation projects, and to the Bishkek-Almaty road, also \nbeing  rehabilitated  through  an  ADB-financed  loan.  In  addition  to  its  key  importance  for  Central \nAsia, the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road has even broader geographic significance. By providing \nan intermodal link between the railway networks of the PRC and Uzbekistan, which terminate in \nKashgar  and  Osh  respectively,  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road  will  enable  the  formation  of  a \ncomprehensive intermodal transportation network extending from Western Europe to the coastal \nregions of the PRC. \n \n23. \nPreparatory work for development of the corridor has been under way for several years. In \n1998,  the  Agreement  on  International  Road  Transportation  between  the  governments  of  the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan, was negotiated. ADB has been actively involved in trying \nto improve cooperation among these countries. Through the ADB-financed regional TA (footnote \n3), regional working group meetings were held in November 2002 and February 2003 to facilitate \nregional transport and trade along the project road and implementation of the Project. Following \nthese  meetings,  the  governments  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  formed  the  Joint  Expert \nGroup,  with  the  objective  of  facilitating  the  improvement  of  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  road \ncorridor. The first Joint Expert Group meeting was held in Bishkek in March 2004. While there is \nintense cooperation between the governments of the PRC and Kyrgyz Republic on improving the \nproject  road  and  facilitating  transport  and  trade,  cross-border  transport  and  trade  across  the \nKyrgyz  Republic-Uzbekistan  border  encounter  some  difficulties.  ADB  is  continuing  to  address \nthese  difficulties  through  dialogue  by  missions  and  the  resident  missions  in  the  region,  and  TA, \nincluding ongoing TA and the attached advisory TA for the road corridor (paras. 39\u201340).  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s programs to rehabilitate the transport corridor and foster regional cooperation have \nmobilized resources beyond those directly involved in the Project. The PRC provided the Kyrgyz \nGovernment with two grants totaling 60 million yuan (about $7.2 million) for rehabilitation of a 19 \nkm  section  of  the  road,  from  Irkeshtam  at  the  Kyrgyz-PRC  border  westward  to  Sary  Tash.  The \ncivil  works  financed  by  these  grants  commenced  in  June  2004.  Also,  the  Islamic  Development \nBank's  program  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  2005\u20132007  includes  two  loans,  of  $10  million \nequivalent  each,  for  rehabilitating  other  sections  of  the  road.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  program  for  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  for  2005\u20132007  includes  a  standby  loan  in  2006  to  rehabilitate  the  remaining \nsection of the road. All sections of the road will be improved based on the same design and to the \nsame  technical  standards,  including  maximum  vehicle  weights.  In  addition,  both  the  PRC  and \nUzbek governments have already rehabilitated or are now improving the sections of the corridor in \ntheir  territories.  The  portion  of  the  corridor  in  Uzbekistan  (comprising  408  km  from  Tashkent  to \nOsh)  is  in  good  condition  and  is  classified  as  category  I  (four-lane,  divided  carriageway)  and \ncategory II (two-lane, single carriageway). Plans are under way to upgrade some of the category II \nsections,  and  two  tunnels  were  recently  completed.  The  PRC  portion  of  the  corridor  consists  of \n240 km from Irkeshtam to Kashgar, and is well maintained and in good condition. Most of the road \nis category III (bitumen surface), although some sections are being upgraded to category II. \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Dialogue and Road Maintenance Financing \n\n \n25. \nADB  has  been  addressing  the  inadequate  financing  for  road  maintenance  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic through policy dialogue and TA. ADB\u2019s initial strategy was to assist the Government in \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2003.

Manila \n\n\f8 \n \n\nestablishing  a  road  fund  to  finance  road  maintenance  and  other  sector  expenditures.  Through \npolicy dialogue under the first ADB-financed road project (footnote 7) and with the assistance of \nan ADB-financed TA for institutional strengthening (footnote 5), the Government passed the Road \nFund Act in 1998. The policy dialogue under the second ADB-financed road project (footnote 6) \nfocused on making the road fund operational, e.g., establishing the revenue sources for the fund \nand  maintaining  the  separate  road  fund  account.  Following  the  termination  of  separate  budget \naccounts  and  consolidation  of  the  national  budget  as  a  result  of  the  country\u2019s  severe  fiscal \nproblems  (para.  9),  ADB  modified  its  strategy  to  focus  on  providing  maintenance  funds  through \nthe Government\u2019s standard budget procedures. The strategy emphasized the need to ensure that \n(i)  sufficient  financing  was  provided  for  the  roads  rehabilitated  under  projects  financed  by  ADB \nand  cofinanciers,  thus  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  Government\u2019s  investment;  and  (ii) \nincreased levels of financing are provided for maintaining all other roads under MOTC jurisdiction, \nto the extent possible, given the country\u2019s fiscal constraints.  \n \nTo implement ADB's revised strategy, the  Third Road  Rehabilitation  Project13 included a \n26. \nloan  covenant  concerning  financing  of  road  maintenance  with  the  following  two  components:  (i) \nfinancing of maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh road, and (ii) financing of maintenance of all other \nroads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction.  The  Government  has  substantially  complied  with  the  covenant, \ndespite  facing  overall  fiscal  constraints  as  well  as  demands  to  repair  infrastructure  damaged  by \nnatural disasters. The Government\u2019s actual expenditures for maintaining the Bishkek-Osh road in \n2002,  2003,  and  2004  exceeded  the  levels  required  by  the  loan  covenant.14  The  Government\u2019s \ncompliance with the first component of the covenant demonstrates that ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has \nbeen  effective  in  ensuring  that  sufficient  financing  is  provided  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s investment in rehabilitating key roads. While the expenditures for  maintenance of \nall  other  roads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction  for  2002\u20132004  fell  short  of  the  required  amount,  the \nshortfalls  in  2002  and  2003  were  only  11%  and  8%,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  combined \namounts for the Bishkek-Osh road as well as other MOTC roads are virtually in compliance with \nthe required levels for 2002\u20132003, and the total amount for 2004 is 25% higher than in 2002.  \n \n27. \nAlthough  the  Government  has  substantially  complied  with  the  maintenance-financing \ncovenant, it is likely to continue to face fiscal constraints. As a result, the Government and ADB \nhave  agreed  on  an  action  plan  for  developing  and  implementing  a  new  strategy  to  ensure \nadequate  road  maintenance  (included  in  Appendix  2).  The  strategy  will  consist  of  the  following \ncomponents: developing new approaches to provide and allocate funding for road maintenance; \nusing cross-border fees generated by the Project to finance maintenance of the project road and \nother  MOTC  roads;  and  continuing  compliance  with  the  maintenance-financing  covenant  for \nrecently rehabilitated roads. The advisory TA for Improving Road Maintenance and Strengthening \nthe  Transport  Corridor  Management  Department  (paras.  39\u201340)  will  develop  a  new  system  of \nprioritization of the road network, estimate maintenance costs for the road categories, develop a \nmethodology  for  allocating  maintenance  expenditures,  and  develop  alternative  means  for \nmaintenance  that  do  not  rely  substantially  on  the  national  budget,  e.g.,  community-based \nmaintenance. The Government has agreed that the revenue from border-crossing fees exceeding \nthe costs of operating and maintaining the transport corridor will be made available to MOTC to \nfinance the maintenance of other MOTC roads (para. 48). MOTC has demonstrated its support for \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  2001.

The \nproposed  loan  will  finance  $24.5  million  (100%)  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $8.3  million \nequivalent  (43.9%)  of  the  total  currency  cost,  or  75.6%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  proposed \nADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nat  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  $6.6  million  to  primarily  cover  taxes  related  to \nthe civil works. Loan proceeds will not be used to finance taxes. The financing plan includes $4 \nmillion in cofinancing, which the Government has requested from the OPEC Fund to finance civil \nworks.  The  project  loan  is  included  in  Government\u2019s  Public  Investment  Program.  The  financing \nplan for the Project is shown in Table 2, and the detailed financing plan is in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment  \nThe OPEC Fund \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n24.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n24.5 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n8.3 \n6.6 \n4.0 \n18.9 \n\n \nTotal \n32.8 \n6.6 \n4.0 \n43.4 \n\nPercentage of  \nProject Cost \n\n75.6 \n15.2 \n9.2 \n100.0 \n\n\f10 \n \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nOrganization and Management \n\nthe  Project.  The  PIU  will  (i)  monitor \n\n \n30.  MOTC,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to \nimplement \nthe  progress  of  day-to-day  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress  reports,  and \n(iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for auditing the Project. The \nhead  of  the  PIU,  who  must  be  acceptable  to  ADB  and  have  adequate  experience  in  project \nmanagement,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of  implementation  activities. \nThe  PIU  head  will  be  supported  by  nine  professional  and  clerical  staff  with  expertise  and \nexperience  in  financial  accounting,  road  engineering,  construction  supervision,  and  contract \nadministration. The PIU will be established and made operational prior to the award of the civil \nworks  contracts.  The  PIU  for  the  Third  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  13)  will  be \nresponsible  for  advance  procurement  action  activities.  ADB  has  been  working  closely  with \nMOTC  for  several  years  on  implementation  of other  road  rehabilitation  projects.  ADB  believes \nthat  MOTC  has,  and  the  PIU  will  have,  with  necessary  consultant  support,  the  financial \nmanagement capacity to manage the Project effectively. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n31. \nThe Project will be implemented in 3.3 years (40 months) from June 2005 to September \n2008, including mobilization but excluding the defects liability period (the period during which the \ncontractor is responsible for maintenance). The civil works for the project road are scheduled to \nbegin  in  September  2005  (including  mobilization)  and  be  completed  by  August  2008.  The \nproposed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n32. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and  $1.0 \nmillion for civil works will be procured through international competitive bidding among prequalified \nbidders. Supply contracts for the equipment have been packaged into two contracts, which will be \nfinanced  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Any  supply  contracts  not \nexceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Civil  works  have  been \npackaged  into  three  contracts\u2014two  will  be  financed  following  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. One contract, for $500,000, for civil works to improve road safety on the Taldyk Pass \nand  construct  a  roadside  station  (road  service  area)  at  Sopu  Korgon,  will  be  financed  following \nlocal competitive bidding procedures. Tentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n33. \nInternational  consulting  services  for  57  person-months  will  be  provided  by  a  firm,  for \nconstruction  supervision,  project  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation,  implementation  of  measures \nto improve road safety, auditing, and project management. The international consultants will also \nprovide on-the-job training for the counterpart staff and domestic consultants. In association with \nthe international consultants, 500 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nfor  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical  advisory  assistance;  as \nwell  as  for  helping  the  international  consultants  monitor  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the \nProject through household surveys and data analysis. Draft terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix B. Sufficient domestic consulting services are available \n\n \n\n\f  11\n\nin  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A full technical proposal will be \nrequired for the consulting services, and the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nin selecting the consultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nAll  disbursements  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n34. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2001).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  (i)  a  direct  payment \nprocedure,  (ii)  a  commitment  procedure,  or  (iii)  a  reimbursement  procedure.  In  view  of  the  high \npriority the  Government accords the Project  and to  minimize implementation delays  and ensure \nthe  timely  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  requested  ADB  approval  for  advance \nprocurement action for civil works packages. The advance actions, up to but not including signing \nof  contracts,  will  cover  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  civil \nworks  contract  packages  to  help  implement  the  Project.  Advance  action  was  approved  at  the \nManagement  Review  Meeting  on  13  July  2004.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB's \napproval  of  the  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  Project  or  finance  any \nrecruitment and procurement costs. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n35.  MOTC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation,  the  form  and  content  of  which  will  be  agreed  with  ADB.  MOTC  will  maintain \nseparate  accounts  for  all  project  components  financed  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  and  have \nthem  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate  knowledge  and  experience  of \ninternational accounting practices and is acceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts and the \nauditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. The \nGovernment has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the  suspension  of  disbursements  in  case  of \nnoncompliance.  To  facilitate  evaluation  of  the  Project,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  provide  a \nproject completion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n36. \nADB  and  MOTC  will  agree  upon  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating project performance in relation to its goals and purposes, with an emphasis on poverty \nreduction,  prior  to  project  commencement.  Representative  indicators  are  included  in  the  project \nframework.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  MOTC  will  confirm  baseline  values  for \nsocial,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  indicators.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be \nmeasured, with the necessary frequency, during project implementation. Comments and findings \nregarding these project indicators  will be incorporated in  every other  quarterly report  to ADB.  In \naddition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be \nmeasured  at  project  completion  and  1  year  and  3  years  after  completion.  Where  relevant, \nindicators will be disaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place, and results will \nbe  compared  with  the  baseline.  A  final  report  will  consist  of  an  evaluation  of  changes  that \noccurred in the preceding 3 years. MOTC has developed its monitoring capability for the ongoing \nprojects,  and  has  the  capacity  to  monitor  the  Project  as  well.  To  facilitate  assessment  of  the \nsocioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  an  international  consultant  will  be \nrecruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n\n\f12 \n \n\n \nA.  \n\nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  in \n37. \n2006.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, and social aspects and poverty reduction. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  project \nperformance will also be assessed. The review will examine the implementation progress for the \npolicy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the officials of the Government during project \nprocessing.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption-free \nenvironment, and has agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in \npreparing all documents and contracts during the bidding process and project implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nImproving Road Maintenance and Strengthening the Transport Corridor \nManagement Department \n\n \n39. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory and operational TA to assist \nin  establishing  and  operating  the  management  department  of  the  Osh-SaryTash-Irkeshtam \ntransport  corridor.  The  TA  will  help  MOTC  improve  road  maintenance;  update  the  corridor \nanalysis,  including  traffic  projections  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs;  establish  and  make \noperational  the  corridor  department  institutional  structure  and  the  corridor  regional  executive \nmanagement agency; and establish and make operational systems for setting and collecting tolls, \nfinancial management, maintenance management, procurement of maintenance equipment, and \ntraffic  facilitation.  The  TA  will  require  about  20  person-months  of  international  and  105  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services,  with  expertise  in  management  of  transport  institutions, \nfinancial analysis, and road maintenance. Outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 8.  \n  \nThe  total  TA  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $950,000  equivalent  comprising  foreign  exchange \n40. \ncost  of  $509,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $441,000  equivalent.  A  TA  grant  of  $800,000 \nequivalent is proposed for ADB financing to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $509,000 \nand $291,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  remaining  local  cost  of \n$150,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  the  Government.  \u041c\u041e\u0422C,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nTA,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  activities,  including  liaison  and \ncoordination  with  other  concerned  Government  departments  or  agencies.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  in  12  months  beginning  in  March  2006.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be  completed  by \nFebruary 2007. A simplified technical proposal will be required for the consulting services, and the \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod in accordance with \u0410D\u0412\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nB. \n\nAwareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and \nHuman Trafficking \n\n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  an  advisory  TA  for  awareness  and \n41. \nprevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking  on  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  transport \ncorridor.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  increases  in  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human \ntrafficking that may arise during road rehabilitation. The TA\u2019s purpose is to raise public awareness \nand  address  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs,  transmission  and  human  trafficking  among \nconstruction  workers,  sex  workers,  local  communities,  truck  drivers,  border  officers,  and  other \nroad users. The TA will require about 11 person-months of international and 72 person-months of \n\n \n\n\f  13\n\ndomestic consulting services, with expertise in health education and advocacy, HIV/AIDS medical \nservices,  epidemiological  surveillance,  prevention  of  human \ntrafficking,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation.  A  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  required  for  the  consulting  services,  and  the \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  in  accordance  with  \u0410D\u0412\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the TA consultants are provided in Appendix 9. \n \n42. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $600,000  equivalent,  comprising  $325,500  in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $274,500  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  A  grant  of  $500,000 \nequivalent, to be financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, is \nproposed to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $174,500 equivalent of local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  by  providing  in-kind \ncontributions  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  workshop  facilities.  The  Ministry  of \nHealthcare  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  TA  in  coordination \nwith MOTC and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Combat Against Illegal Trafficking in Humans. TA \nimplementation  will  commence  in  the  second  half  of  2005,  or  3  months  before  the \ncommencement of the civil works under the Project, and be completed 3 years later in 2008. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  and  type  of  traffic  (normal,  diverted,  and  generated) \n43. \nwere  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2005\u20132027.  The  forecasts  are  based  on \nexpected growth in GDP, on income elasticities of demand for freight and passenger vehicles, \nand on expected future trade patterns. GDP is estimated to grow at 4.5%. per annum. Income \nelasticities  of  demand  of  1.4,  1.2,  and  1.0  are  for  cars,  buses,  and  trucks,  respectively, \ncomprising  normal  traffic.  Elasticities  of  1.3  and  1.1  are  applied  to  passenger  and  freight \nvehicles, respectively, for the remainder of the project period. Based on forecast GDP growth, \nincome  elasticities  of  demand,  and  expected  trade  patterns  over  the  total  project  period, \naverage annual traffic growth rates for buses, cars, and trucks are estimated at 6.3%, 5.4%, and \n4.5%  during  2005\u20132015,  and  3.0%  for  all  vehicles  during  the  remainder  of  the  project  period. \nThe traffic forecast is in Appendix 10. Normal traffic is expected to account for 65%\u201370% of total \ntraffic on the project road sections in 2027. Trucks are forecast to comprise the majority of traffic \non the road following implementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Distribution Analysis \n\n \nThe economic analysis was carried out for the project road on the basis of a comparison \n44. \nof  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  (Appendix  11).  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the \nroad is assumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-\nproject  scenario  assumes  that,  following  project  completion,  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \nwill  follow  international  standards.  During  the  project  preparatory  work  (footnote  3),  various \ndesign alternatives were considered; the project design is based on the least-cost option. \n \n45. \nProject economic costs include the resource costs of road improvement and maintenance, \nmaintenance  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the \nsame  methodology  used  for  costs.  The  primary  economic  benefits  for  the  Project  arise  from  (i) \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings  for  normal  traffic,  (ii)  generated  domestic  traffic,  (iii)  reduction  of \n\n\f14 \n \n\nroad closing times due to improved winter maintenance, (iv) increased agricultural income, and (v) \ncollection  of  border-crossing  fees.  Generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the \nreduction  of  transport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  The  Project  includes  procurement  of \nmaintenance equipment for the entire road from Osh to Irkeshtam, and the associated TA will help \nmanage  maintenance  and  other  operations  on  the  road.  Improved  maintenance  will  result  in  a \nsignificant  reduction  in  road  closures  during  winter.  Upon  completion  of  the  Project,  border-\ncrossing  fees  will  be  charged,  and  will  replace  the  fees  charged  for  permits  under  the  current \nsystem.  The  fees  paid  by  non-Kyrgyz  road  users  represent  benefits  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic. \nBenefits from increased agricultural income arise from the higher prices that farmers will be able \nto  obtain  for  their  produce  (primarily  vegetables  and  livestock)  through  improved  access  to \nmarkets.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  such  as  time  savings,  improved  road  safety, \nand improved access to social services; these have not been quantified. \n  \n46. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project,  including  only  benefits \naccruing to the Kyrgyz Republic, is 13.3% and the net present value is $3.0 million using a 12% \ndiscount rate. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat capital costs would have to increase by 13% or total benefits decrease by 11% for the EIRR \nto reach the cutoff level of 12%. The risks of the EIRR declining below 12% are mitigated by the \nuncomplicated  nature  of  the  rehabilitation  works,  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  other  CARs,  and  the  conservative  assumptions  used  in  the  analysis.  The \nProject  will  also  result  in  benefits  to  other  countries  from  international  generated  and  diverted \ntraffic,  which  are  not  included  in  the  EIRR  calculation  as  they  do  not  accrue  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new  traffic  arising  from  increased  trade \nbetween  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  PRC,  and  Uzbekistan  resulting  from  improvement  of  the  project \nroad, and also to and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Diverted traffic comprises traffic diverted \nfrom  two  existing  routes:  Uzbekistan-Russian  Federation  and  Uzbekistan-PRC.  Traffic  will  be \ndiverted as the road will enable a switch to markets in the PRC in the first case and to the shorter \nproject route in the second case. The present value of the benefits from international generated \nand diverted traffic is estimated at $123 million. \n \n47. \nDistribution analysis was carried out to determine the Project\u2019s primary beneficiaries. The \nproject benefits are distributed among five national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users \nof passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) laborers, and (v) the Government/economy of the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  groups  receiving \nthe \nthe \nGovernment/economy and freight users, predominantly  private sector.  The large share  accruing \nto  the  Government/economy  arises  from  the  benefits  from  the  border-crossing  fees.  The  large \nshare  accruing  to  freight  users  is  due  to  the  large  share  of  vehicle  operating  cost  savings \naccounted for by trucks and the competitive nature of the Kyrgyz trucking industry, which makes it \nlikely that the vehicle operating cost savings will be passed on to users through reduced fares. \n \nB. \n \n48. \nA system for collection of border-crossing fees will be implemented following completion of \nthe  Project,  and  will  replace  the  fees  charged  for  permits  under  the  current  system.  The \nGovernment has agreed that the fees will be set at a minimum of Som850 per vehicle crossing \n(about $20). The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. The Government agreed that \nrevenue from the fees will be used to finance operation and maintenance of the Osh-Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam  transport  corridor;  any  excess  revenue  will  be  used  to  finance  maintenance  of  other \nroads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction  (para.  62).  Estimates  of  revenues  from  the  border-crossing  fees \nand corridor maintenance and operating costs are shown in Appendix 11. The estimates indicate \n\nlargest  shares  of \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\nthe  benefits  are \n\n \n\n\f  15\n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nthat  the  fees  will  cover  the  corridor  costs  and  generate  a  substantial  surplus  ranging  from  $1.6 \nmillion to $6.0 million per year, which will be used for maintenance of other roads. \n \nC. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  area  and  the  country  by \nfacilitating  economic  growth  through  increased  regional  trade  and  by  reducing  transport  costs. \nThe  poverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  is  49%,  higher  than  the  national  level  of  41%.  The \nProject  is  expected  to  benefit  about  67,000  people,  including  about  38,000  poor.  The  primary \neconomic  activity  in  the  project  area  is  agriculture,  with  the  raising  of  livestock  becoming  more \ndominant the greater the distance from Osh. According to surveys during project preparation, the \nmain causes of poverty are unemployment and the low prices received  for agricultural produce. \nThe Project will address both of these causes of poverty by facilitating trade; facilitating transport \nof  local  agricultural  produce  to  markets;  improving  access  to  social  services;  creating  jobs  for \nproject  implementation;  reducing  transport  costs;  providing  income  generation  opportunities \nthrough  construction  of  a  roadside  station;  and  maximizing  the  poverty-reduction  benefits  from \nother projects being implemented in the project area. \n \n50. \nThe Project will primarily reduce poverty by facilitating regional traffic and trade and thus \nincreased exports and job creation, and reducing transport costs for residents of the project area. \nBy  providing  improved  access  to  Xinjiang  with  its  large  market,  as  well  as  to  Afghanistan  and \nTajikistan, the Project will lead to increased exports of Kyrgyz goods and therefore job creation in \nthe project area, especially in Osh, thus helping to reduce the high levels of unemployment. The \nincreased  levels  of  traffic  on  the  project  road  will  also  result  in  job  creation  by  stimulating  the \nroadside  service  industry,  e.g.,  provision  of  food  for  drivers  and  vehicle-repair  services,  thus \nproviding  employment  for  local  residents.  The  improvement  of  the  project  road  will  improve \naccess to the city of Osh and other locations where higher prices are paid for agricultural products \nand there are more job opportunities than in the project area. Reductions in transport costs will be \npassed  on  to  the  users  of  the  transport  services.  This  will  improve  the  terms  of  trade  for  poor \nfarmers  in  the  project  area  by  lowering  the  costs  of  agricultural  inputs  and  increasing  prices  for \nagricultural outputs, such as vegetables and livestock (Supplementary Appendix A). The improved \nroad condition will increase the number of traders traveling to the project area to buy produce. The \nProject  will  also  improve  access  to  social  services  in  Osh,  and  the  advisory  TA  will  increase \nawareness of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking (paras. 41\u201342). \n \n51. \nThe Project will encourage the hiring of poor people from the project area for unskilled and \nsemiskilled  labor,  and  will  encourage  the  hiring  of  women  who  head  households,  as  well  as \ndisadvantaged women in general. While the employment opportunities from the Project will only \nyield  short-term  direct  benefits  to  the  poor,  the  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  will  be  longer  term. \nAccording to surveys conducted by the TA consultants and the Fact-Finding Mission, 50% of the \nresidents of  the communities along  the project road are indebted; the income from employment \ncan be used to pay off these debts. The residents also indicate that they will use the income from \nshort-term  employment  to  invest  in  income-generating  activities,  such  as  processing  of  locally \nproduced materials and producing higher value crops and livestock. \n \n52. \nThe  civil  works  under  the  Project  include  construction  of  a  roadside  station  at  Sopu \nKorgon. The roadside station will reduce poverty by providing employment opportunities and also \na  site  for  selling  local  products.  Employment  will  be  generated  for  providing  vehicle  and  food \nservices, as only a very limited number of outlets for these services are available between Gulcha \nand  the  the  PRC  border.  The  roadside  station  will  also  increase  incomes  for  poor  farmers  and \n\n\f16 \n \n\nSocial Impact and Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\nothers  by  providing  a  site  at  which  they  can  sell  agricultural  produce  and  handicrafts  without \nhaving to transport the goods long distances to markets.  \n \n53. \nThe Project will maximize the poverty-reduction impact of projects being implemented by \nADB and other international agencies. Three ADB-financed projects are improving social services \nin  the  project  area:  [Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project15  (drinking  water \nsupply),  Education  Sector  Development  Project,16  and  Social  Services  Delivery  and  Finance \nProject.]17  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  the  World  Bank  are  implementing \nincluding  microfinance,  physical  and  social \ncomprehensive  poverty  reduction  activities, \ninfrastructure,  small  business  development,  and  other  agriculture-related  income  generation \nactivities.  Other  agencies,  including  the  Global  Ecological  Fund  and  German  Agro  Action,  are \nimplementing  agricultural  projects  focusing  on  small-scale  agribusiness  activities  and  farmers. \nMany other agencies are active in the project area as well. By improving transport in the project \narea,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  transport  of  the  increased  agricultural  production  to  markets, \nand thus contribute to the maximization of the poverty-reduction impact of these projects. \n \nD. \n \n54. \nKey  social  issues  were  analyzed  during  the  social  analysis  conducted  as  part  of  the \nregional  TA  (footnote  3)  that  prepared  the  Project  and  were  further  developed  during  project \nprocessing.  The  project  design  was  discussed  in  detail  with  local  government  officials  and \nrepresentatives  of  the  affected  communities.  During  project  preparation,  the  regional  TA \nconsultants conducted a detailed survey of 300 households in the project area. The communities \nare aware of the Project and the implications for their welfare; they support the Project. Although \nnot cited as a major concern in the social survey, HIV/AIDS and human trafficking are new and \nincreasing problems. While the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS remains relatively low, the number \nof cases in the country has been increasing rapidly\u2014from one reported case in 1996 to 583 as of \nAugust 2004. In 2003, Osh Oblast, in which the project area is located, had the highest incidence \nof any of the country\u2019s oblasts, with 239 cases of AIDS, including two detected in Alai raion, which \ncomprises part of the project area. Also, due to its geographic location and economic situation, the \nKyrgyz Republic is a country both of origin and transit of victims of human trafficking. About 4,000 \nwomen  were  reported  to  have  been  victims  of  human  trafficking  in  1999.  The  human  trafficking \nproblem  is  also  most  severe  in  Osh  Oblast.  Although  most  HIV/AIDS  cases  in  the  country  are \ntransmitted  by  intravenous  drug  use,  the  Project  may  contribute  to  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking problems, and therefore negatively impact women, by increasing the number of foreign \nworkers  during  construction  and  transit  traffic  following  project  completion.  To  mitigate  this \npotential impact, an attached advisory TA will be provided to increase awareness and prevention \nof  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking  (paras.  41\u201342).  In  addition,  the  project  supervision \nconsultants  will  include  a  domestic  consultant  to  monitor  these  issues.  The  contractors  will \ndistribute  information  to  project  workers,  and  the  Project  will  coordinate  with  agencies  and \nnongovernment organizations involved in HIV/AIDS and trafficking prevention activities \n \n55. \nOther than the HIV/AIDS and trafficking issues, the Project will have no adverse impact on \nvulnerable  groups  and  no  negative  implication  for  gender  concerns  or  indigenous  people.

The project activities will \noccur  within  the  existing  alignment  or  on  land  owned  by  the  Government.  The  Government \nagreed to ensure that the Project is implemented, to the extent possible, with active participation \nof  the  project  beneficiaries,  using  participatory  practices,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  handbook, \nMainstreaming Participatory Development Processes. \n \nE. \n \nThe project classification is environment category B. An initial environmental examination \n56. \n(IEE) of the Project was carried out under the regional TA (footnote 3) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Review  Procedures,  and \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that the Project \nwill  not  have  any  major  adverse  environmental  impact  as  it  involves  mainly  rehabilitation  of  the \nexisting alignment of the project road (except for minor realignments due to difficult geotechnical \nconditions). The Project will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement. The Osh- Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam  road  crosses  the  Bel-Ulim  State  Forest  Reserve  at  one  point  (between  Sopu  Korgon \nand  Sary  Tash)  beyond  the  sections  being  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.  The  increased  traffic \nresulting from the Project will not have any impact on the reserve. Furthermore, rehabilitation of \nthis part of the road under a future project is not expected to have any significant impact on the \nreserve, as changes in the alignment are not anticipated. The summary IEE is in Appendix 12. \n \nF. \n \n57. \nThe total number of road accidents in the Kyrgyz Republic increased from 1,135 in 1999 \nto 1,555 in 2003. On the project road the annual number of accidents ranged from 21 in 2001 to \n41 in 2003, with the annual number of deaths ranging from 5 in 2001 to 29 in 2003, and injuries \nfrom  20  in  2001  to  92  in  2003.  The  primary  cause  of  accidents  is  excessive  driving  speed  on \nroads in mountainous terrain. Many roads outside of the cities, including the project road, pass \nthrough  mountainous  terrain  and/or  alongside  rivers,  with  the  road  alignment  varying \nsignificantly along the same road and sometimes changing suddenly. The mountainous terrain \nalso results in significant rockfall hazards on many roads, including the project road. During the \nwinter season, ice- and snow-covered roads comprise a major safety hazard. The absence of \nrest areas and roadside service facilities over long distances may also contribute to accidents. \n \n58. \nADB  has  been  significantly  involved  in  improving  road  safety  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nthrough  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  6)  and  the  Almaty-Bishkek  Regional \nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  10).  The  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  prepared  a \ntime-bound  road safety program to reduce the accident rate. Under the Almaty-Bishkek Project, \nthe Government established the Road Safety Committee and the committee\u2019s secretariat in April \n2004 to coordinate road safety activities and involve the various stakeholders. The secretariat has \nbegun  its  work,  including  preparing  a  road  accident  database  and  other  safety  information.  The \nGovernment also agreed to update the Road Safety Act for submission to Parliament. The act will \ninclude  legislation  concerning  safe  driving,  safety  audit  of  road  designs,  safety  education,  road \nsafety  publicity,  vehicle  safety  standards,  road  safety  research,  and  emergency  assistance  to \naccident  victims.  The  advisory  TA18  attached  to  the  Almaty-Bishkek  Project  has  helped  the \nGovernment establish the National Road Safety Council, update the Road Safety Act, prepare a \nRussian version of the Road Safety Guidelines prepared under an earlier TA,19 and conduct road \nsafety seminars to implement the guidelines.  \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f18 \n \n\nProject Risks \n\n \n59. \nThe  rehabilitation  works  under  the  Project  will  substantially  improve  road  safety.  The \nProject also includes several measures to improve road safety, in addition to improving the road \nsurface,  where  extensive  deterioration  results  in  unsafe  driving  conditions,  and  replacing \ndeteriorated bridges. The installation and maintenance of proper signage and lane markings to \nhighlight  changes  in  alignment  and  other  safety  hazards  will  be  emphasized.  The  supervision \nconsultants will prepare an inventory of slopes subject to rockfalls and landslides, and prepare \nslope  mitigation  measures  to  be  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works.  The  Project  includes  a \nseparate  civil  works  contract  to  (i)  provide  road  furniture  and  implement  other  measures  to \nimprove  road  safety  at  the  Taldyk  Pass  (between  Sopu  Korgon  and  Sary  Tash,  outside  the \nproject  road  sections  to  be  rehabilitated),  and  (ii)  construct  a  roadside  station.  Snow  removal \nequipment  to  improve  road  safety  during  the  winter  will  be  included  in  the  maintenance \nequipment  to  be  procured.  The  supervision  consultants  will  also  examine  the  possibility  of \nestablishing rest areas. Consulting services include an international road safety expert, who will \nconduct  a  road  safety  audit,  advise  MOTC  on  enforcement  measures  to  improve  road  safety, \nand provide TA for incorporating road-safety features in the project design. Domestic consulting \nservices  will  also  address  road  safety.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  agreed  on  vehicle-\nweighing  measures  to  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  Project  (para.  62).  By  March  2005,  the \nGovernment will establish rules and procedures to implement the June 2004 parliamentary decree \non weighing vehicles. The Government will also ensure that a vehicle weighing system becomes \noperational  on  the  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  road  (including  installation  and  use  of \nweighing equipment at selected entry points and enforcement of rules) by December 2005. \n \nG. \n \n60. \nThe Project is designed to reduce potential risks, including delays in implementation due \nto  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  MOTC,  failure  to  provide  counterpart  financing  in  a \ntimely  manner,  lower  than  projected  traffic,  and  inadequate  road  maintenance.  The  Project \nincludes  several  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation  delays.  MOTC  will  create  a \nPIU  to  implement  the  Project,  and  has  identified  the  number  and  type  of  additional  staff  be \nhired. The detailed design has been completed. ADB has approved advance action. MOTC has \nextensive  experience  with  ADB  procedures  and  will  be  able  to  make  full  use  of  the  advance \naction provisions. Given the high priority that the Government assigns to the Project (para.2), the \nGovernment will make every effort to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds. In addition, \nADB  and  the  Government  are  closely  monitoring  the  Public  Investment  Program  restrictions \nagreed to by the Government and the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the Project does \nnot cause disbursements to exceed agreed limits. \n \n61. \nThere  is  some  risk  that  the  traffic  forecast  will  not  materialize,  especially  for  the \ninternational  generated  traffic  arising  from  increased  trade,  from  which  some  of  the  border- \ncrossing  fees  arise.  In  particular,  obstacles  to  trade  and  traffic  moving  across  the  border \nbetween  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan  may  continue  to  be  a  problem.  To  address  this \nrisk, the advisory TA includes facilitation of regional cooperation and development of a regional \nagency to manage the overall transport corridor. If the project road is not properly maintained, \nthe full benefits of the Project will not be realized. The Government is aware of the importance \nof  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the  project  area,  which  is  mountainous  and  prone  to \nlandslides  and  rockfalls.  The  project  design  includes  elements  to  address  the  risks  of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the  project  road.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  loan  assurances  requiring  the  allocation  of  specific  levels  of \nfinancing for maintaining the project road, as well as increased financing for road maintenance \n\n \n\n\f  19\n\nnationally. The Project includes procurement of road maintenance equipment, solely for use on \nthe project road. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n Specific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n62. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nCounterpart  funding.  The  Government  will  provide,  on  a  timely  basis,  all  funds \nand resources necessary for rehabilitating the Osh-Gulcha-Sopu Korgon road (the \nproject  road),  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nIrkeshtam road in accordance with the financing plan agreed for the Project. The \nGovernment will ensure that the Ministry of Finance takes all necessary measures \nto ensure that MOTC can successfully implement rehabilitation of the project road, \nand operate and maintain it after project completion. Before the end of each year, \nthe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  public  investment  program  for  the \nsucceeding year, demonstrating availability of necessary funds and resources for \nrehabilitation, operation and maintenance, and management of the project road. \n\nCofinancing.

Road  transport  dominates \n1. \nthe  country's  transport  system,  accounting  for  about  94%  of  freight  tonnage  movements  and \nalmost  all  passenger  traffic  (excluding  intra-urban)  in  2001.  The  railway  network  consists  of \nseparate branch lines that link the north of the country to the Kazakhstan rail system, and the \nsouth of the country to the Uzbekistan system, with no direct connection between the two links. \nAir transport accounts for less than 1% of passenger movements, mainly between Bishkek and \nOsh. Water transport is confined to a few vessels on Lake Issyk-Kul. \n \nAs  with  most  other  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  economic  crisis  stemming \n2. \nfrom  the  breakup  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  resulted  in  a  decline  in  economic  activity  and \ndisrupted  customary  trading  patterns.  The  demand  for  transport  has  fallen  dramatically  since \nindependence.  In  2001,  freight  turnover  (measured  in  ton-kilometers  [km])  was  only  20%  of  its \n1990  level  and  passenger  turnover  was  57%  of  its  previous  level.1  The  lowest  levels  were \nreached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton-km and passenger movements were only 14% \nand  33%  of  their  respective  1990  levels,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  real  incomes  and  output. \nDemand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight decreased again following the 1998 financial crisis. \nPassenger transport has been growing at about 6% annually since 1997. \n \n3. \nThe  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  covers  all  seven  provinces  (oblasts),  and \nprovides connections to remote communities and links to neighboring countries. About 18,900 km \nof  roads  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC): \n9,900  km  of  state  roads  and  9,000  km  of  local  roads.  About  40%  of  the  roads  are  sealed, \nincluding some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50% are gravel and less than 10% \nare  earth  roads.  Since  most  of  the  roads  were  designed  for  higher  traffic  capacity  and  are \nunderutilized,  the  existing  basic  transport  infrastructure  is  adequate  for  the  level  of  economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion or \nmajor  upgrading  of  the  transport  system,  but  proper  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  to  preserve \nthe  existing  network.  Roads  at  all  levels  are  deteriorating;  over  60%  now  require  periodic \nmaintenance or rehabilitation. About 15,000 km of roads are outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly \nrural  and  farm  roads.  Most  were  formerly  the  responsibility  of  state  and  collective  farms.  The \nresponsibility for maintaining rural and farm roads is now with the district administrations following \nthe breakup of the state and collective farm system. \n \n4. \nThe  Automobile  Roads  Act  gives  the  main  responsibility  for  planning  and  administering \nroad  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC,  which  is  responsible  for  policymaking  and \nregulating,  planning,  and  developing  transport  and  communications,  including  the  road,  railway, \nand  aviation  sectors.  The  Department  of  Roads,  under  MOTC,  is  responsible  for  managing  the \nroad sector. MOTC's seven regional road maintenance agencies, one in each province, plus the \nBishkek-Osh  Road  Division  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the  state  and  local  roads  under \nMOTC's  jurisdiction.  The  regional  road  maintenance  agencies  and  Bishkek-Osh  Road  Division \ncomprise  58  local  maintenance  units  that  carry  out  actual  maintenance  works.  Other  important \nagencies  in  the  road  sector  are  (i)  KyrgyzIntrans,  a  holding  agency  for  six  freight  transport \ncompanies  and  forwarding  agencies  engaged  mainly  in  international  trade;  and  (ii)  technical \nagencies  in  various  stages  of  divestment  from  MOTC\u2019s  control,  including  the  Road  Design \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003.

Of the total 251 transport enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been privatized, \nprimarily  through  conversion  to  joint-stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies  provide  road \ntransport  services;  74  have  been  privatized.  The  companies  that  have  not  been  privatized \ncomprise  urban  bus  enterprises  in  major  cities  and  some  enterprises  connected  with  state \nsecurity.  The  transport  companies  employ  about  25,000.  Most  of  the  freight  and  passenger \ntransport  companies  operate  at  the  provincial  and  district  (raion)  level,  with  a  small  number  of \nnational operators. As a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 to increase \ncompetition, most of the national and provincial holding companies and associations (which had \ncontinued  to  exercise  control  over  the  operations  of  individual  transport  companies)  were \nabolished. \n \nThe Government continues to have a strong influence in the market for intercity passenger \n6. \ntransport. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created  in MOTC in  1994, issues transport licenses and \nregulates  transport  services.  The  market  for  freight  transport  services  is  more  competitive  than \nthat for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions of price \nand quality of service directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate \nand  arrange  intermodal  transport  services,  thus  facilitating  door-to-door  transport  arrangements, \nand  to  offer  services  directly  themselves.  However,  the  Government  also  plays  a  large  role  in \nfreight transport through regulation. MOTC is responsible for monitoring and regulation, including \nlicensing,  inspection,  and  safety  audits.  Increased  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport \nservices  is  necessary  to  improve  transport  services  and  ensure  that  the  reductions  in  transport \ncosts are passed on to transport users. The Government has made substantial efforts to privatize \nroad  construction  and  maintenance  operations.  All  of  the  29  road  construction  enterprises  have \nbeen  privatized.  The  uncertainty  relating  to  the  road  construction  program  of  the  Department  of \nRoads  has  hindered  development  of  the  private  road  construction  industry.  However,  ADB's \nongoing road rehabilitation projects have assisted in developing the privatized road construction \nenterprises through extensive subcontracting by the civil works contractors. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancing of Road Maintenance \n\nFinancing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate \n\n \n7. \nfor the country\u2019s needs.

The specific sources of revenue for the road fund are (i) 50% of the \nexcise  taxes  on  fuel,  (ii)  100%  of  the  0.8%  tax  on  enterprises,  (iii)  100%  of  the  tax  on  vehicle \nowners, (iv) 90% of vehicle registration fees, (v) charges for the use of toll roads and tunnels, (vi) \ncharges for oversize and overweight vehicles, (vii) state budget allocations, and (viii) foreign loans \nand  grants.  In  view  of  the  severe  fiscal  problems  faced  by  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  ADB  waived  a \nloan  covenant  requiring  the  establishment  of  a  separate  dedicated  road  fund  account,  although \nthe  collection  of  road  user  charges  in  accordance  with  the  Road  Fund  Act  is  continuing.  At \npresent,  the Ministry of  Finance  makes annual  allocations for road  maintenance  and other  road \nsector expenditures based on overall budget considerations. Road sector financing by source and \ntype is shown in Table A2.2. The allocations have been inadequate to meet the sector\u2019s needs. \nTotal Government road sector expenditures ranged from $5.8 to $11.4 million during 2000\u20132003, \npeaking  in  2002.  Planned  Government  expenditures  for  2004  and  2005  are  $13.0  and  $9.6 \nmillion, respectively. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Road Sector Financing in the Kyrgyz Republic \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nSubtotal \n\nGovernment \nExternal Financing \n \n\nMaintenance \n \n \n \nRehabilitation \nGovernment \n \nExternal Financing \n \n \n \nTotal \n \n \n \n\nGovernment \nExternal Financing \n \n\n  Totalc \n\nSubtotal \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n2.880 \n0.000 \n2.880 \n \n2.917 \n21.942 \n24.860 \n\n5.798 \n21.942 \n27.740 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004a \n\n2005b \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.254 \n0.000 \n4.254 \n\n \n\n2.792 \n24.516 \n27.308 \n \n\n7.046 \n24.516 \n31.562 \n\n \n\n3.863 \n0.000 \n3.863 \n\n \n\n7.489 \n15.313 \n22.802 \n \n11.353 \n15.313 \n26.665 \n\n \n\n5.445 \n0.000 \n5.445 \n\n \n\n4.063 \n7.582 \n11.645 \n \n\n9.508 \n7.582 \n17.090 \n\n \n\n6.541 \n0.000 \n6.541 \n\n \n\n6.485 \n21.402 \n27.887 \n \n13.026 \n21.402 \n34.428 \n\n \n\n5.308 \n0.000 \n5.308 \n\n \n\n4.284 \n16.183 \n20.466 \n \n\n9.593 \n16.183 \n25.775 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na  From approved budget and supplemental allocations and reallocations as of 11 October 2004. \nb  From draft 2005 budget. \nc  Includes minor amounts for other road sector expenditures not shown separately. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications and Ministry of Finance. \n\n \nExpenditures on road maintenance accounted for at least half of the Government\u2019s road \n9. \nsector  expenditures  during  2000\u20132003,  except  for  2002.

The \nGovernment\u2019s actual expenditures for maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh road in 2002, 2003, and \n2004 exceeded the levels required by the loan covenant.5 The Government\u2019s compliance with the \nfirst  component  of  the  covenant  demonstrates  that  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  has  been  effective  in \nensuring  that  sufficient  financing  is  provided  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  Government\u2019s \ninvestment  in  rehabilitating  key  national  roads.  While  the  expenditures  for  maintenance  for  all \nother  roads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction  for  2002\u20132004  fell  short  of  the  required  amount,  the \nshortfalls  in  2002  and  2003  were  only  11%  and  8%,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  combined \namounts for the Bishkek-Osh road as well as other MOTC roads are virtually in compliance with \nthe  required  levels  for  2002\u20132003,  and  the  total  amount  for  2004  is  25%  higher  than  in  2002. \nAlthough the Government has substantially complied with the maintenance-financing covenant, it \nis likely to continue to face fiscal constraints. As a result, the Government and ADB have agreed \non  an  action  plan  for  developing  and  implementing  a  new  strategy  to  ensure  adequate  road \nmaintenance,  shown  in  Table  A2.4.  The  new  strategy  for  road  maintenance  will  be  developed \nunder the attached TA (Appendix 8). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The  covenant  refers  to  budget  allocations  for  maintenance,  with  which  the  Government  is  not  in  compliance. \nHowever,  in  practice,  the  Government  budget  process  relies  on  supplemental  allocations  and  reprogramming  of \napproved  allocations.  In  terms  of  actual  expenditures,  the  Government  has  exceeded  the  required  levels,  and  is \ntherefore in compliance with the intent of this component of the covenant. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A2.4:  Action Plan for Road Maintenance in the Kyrgyz Republic  \n\n30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nAction \n1.

The Government's overall policy \nobjectives  for  transport  include  (i)  adequately  maintaining  transport  infrastructure  to  support  the \nreform  of  the  economy;  (ii)  privatizing  transport  operations  and  promoting  competition  among \noperators, while addressing safety and environmental concerns; and (iii) increasing cost recovery \nfrom the users of transport infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, the Government's strategy \nincludes (i) increasing the financial provision for rehabilitating and maintaining the road network; \n(ii)  consolidating  road  sector  responsibilities  under  MOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation  in  road  maintenance;  (iv)  completing  the  privatization  of  road  transport  operations \nand dismantling licensing controls, which hinder competition; (v) promoting, in collaboration with \nneighboring  countries,  rail  transport  as  the  most  efficient  means  of  transporting  bulk  loads  over \nlong  distances;  (vi)  privatizing  lake  shipping  services;  (vii)  promoting  civil  aviation  infrastructure \nand supporting services that encourage foreign and local airline operations; and (viii) increasing \nroad sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation. \n \nD. \n \nADB has been involved in the Kyrgyz road sector since 1996, implementing three projects \n12. \nfor the rehabilitation of the Bishkek-Osh road, and one for the Bishkek-Almaty Road, for a total of \n$145  million.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  road  sector  has  been  guided  by  its  sector  strategy  and \nbeen  instrumental  in  improving  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  providing  institutional \nstrengthening  for  MOTC  and  other  sector  institutions,  preparing  a  road  maintenance  plan,  and \nmobilizing  additional  resources  from  other  agencies.  ADB  is  playing  a  leading  role  in  providing \npolicy advice, capacity building, and capital financing for the Kyrgyz road sector, and has provided \nseven TA grants worth $4.2 million. ADB has been involved in policy dialogue for transport in the \nKyrgyz Republic since 1996. It has focused on transport regulation; financing of the road sector, \nparticularly  road  maintenance;  and  road  safety.  The  policy  dialogue  for  the  Third  Road \nRehabilitation  Project  (footnote  3),  ADB\u2019s  most  recent  road  sector  project,  focused  primarily  on \nroad  maintenance  financing  and  practices,  making  markets  for  transport  services  more \ncompetitive, and implementing reforms in MOTC\u2019s financial management. \n \n13. \nADB has helped MOTC streamline management of the road sector. In conjunction with the \npolicy  dialogue  under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  3)  and  following  the \npassage  of  Law  No.  8  on  Transport  and  issuance  of  Decree  No.  419  in  1998,  MOTC  was \nrestructured  to  improve  its  efficiency.  As  part  of  the  restructuring,  a  Government  decree  was \nissued in January 1999 requiring consolidation of the administration of transport-related activities. \nThis  resulted  in  a  restructuring  of  responsibilities  among  the  Ministry  of  Architecture  and \nConstruction,  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  and  MOTC.  In  1998,  the  Directorate  General  for \nRehabilitation  and  Maintenance  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  was  integrated  into  the  Department  of \nRoads. The Government transferred responsibilities for developing road design and construction \nstandards from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction to MOTC, and in 1999 the Ministry of \nInternal  Affairs  and  MOTC  agreed  to  jointly  administer  the  functions  of  road  safety  and  traffic \nmanagement,  while  leaving  the  responsibility  for  vehicle  inspection  with  the  Ministry  of  Internal \nAffairs.  To  determine  the  broad  expenditure  priorities  in  accordance  with  road  traffic,  road \nconditions,  and  possible  types  of  intervention,  ADB  is  assisting  MOTC,  through  the  institutional \nstrengthening TA, 6 to review the existing planning and budgeting practices for road maintenance, \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

The TA, Policy Support in the Transport Sector,7 made \nrecommendations for improving financial management in MOTC. The Government has agreed to \nimplement the recommendations. \n \n14. \nADB  is  addressing  issues  affecting  competitiveness  of  the  market  for  passenger  and \nfreight transport services through policy dialogue and provision of TA. The ongoing advisory TA \nfor institutional strengthening includes a component to analyze the markets for transport services \nand  give  recommendations  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  markets  to  maximize  the \npoverty reduction impact of the Third Road Rehabilitation Project. Another TA will also study the \nimpact  of  the  measures  to  increase  competitiveness  on  the  poorest  part  of  the  population,  and \nany  additional  measures  to  ensure  that  the  poorest  are  not  negatively  affected  by  regulatory \nchanges or other proposed measures. The Government has agreed to implement the regulatory \nchanges  recommended  by  the  TA  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport \nservices to ensure that the project benefits are passed on to the poor. \n \nADB has also been working with MOTC to improve the equipment and methods used for \n15. \nroad  maintenance.  Under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  a  maintenance  manual  was \nprepared,  and  a  training  program  for  maintenance  personnel  was  implemented.  Maintenance \nequipment  for  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  was  purchased  through  the  cofinanced  portion  of  the  first \nRoad Rehabilitation Project.8 While the Government wants to retain the local maintenance units \nas  part  of  MOTC,  it  has  undertaken  measures,  with  ADB  assistance,  to  contract  out  road \nmaintenance  activities.  Under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  the  Government  has \ninvited bids from local contractors to undertake routine maintenance on a section of the Bishkek-\nOsh road. Under the Third Road Rehabilitation Project, MOTC will invite bids from contractors for \nroutine  maintenance  on  all  sections  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  for  which  the  construction \ncontractor's warranty period has expired. Policy dialogue under ADB's early projects focused on \nmaintaining  national  roads.  However,  the  Third  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  which  is  improving \nsecondary  roads  along  with  sections  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road,  will  extend  improved  road \nmaintenance  practices  to  secondary  roads  as  well.  The  institutional  strengthening  TA  is \ndeveloping  a  system  for  maintaining  secondary  roads  based  on  collaboration  between  the  local \nmaintenance  units  and  local  communities,  which  will  help  ensure  that  the  poverty-reduction \nbenefits  of  improving  secondary  roads  will  be  sustained.  MOTC  has  agreed  to  ensure  the \nmaintenance  of  secondary  roads  rehabilitated  under  the  Third  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  by \npreparing  the  local  maintenance  units  assigned  to  the  Project\u2019s  secondary  roads  to  operate  the \nnew maintenance system, including procuring appropriate maintenance equipment and enacting \nor modifying any necessary regulations.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?    N.A. \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: The road sector is the most \nimportant transport mode in the Kyrgyz Republic, accounting for about 94% of freight tonnage movements and almost \nall  passenger  traffic.  Rehabilitating  road  sector  infrastructure  contributes  directly  to  poverty  reduction  by  reducing \ntransportation costs and improving access to economic opportunities and social services, and indirectly by stimulating \neconomic  development.  The  road  sector\u2019s  linkages  to  other  countries  provide  opportunities  for  subsistence  farmers \nand  other  poor  to  engage  in  higher  value  agricultural  production  and  to  participate  in  other  income-generating  and \nemployment  opportunities  outside  the  country.  Given  the  limited  size  of  domestic  markets,  roads  linking  to  markets \nabroad are crucial for the country\u2019s sustainable economic development and poverty reduction. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Osh oblast (province), where the project is located, is the fourth poorest \namong  the  seven  oblasts  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  comprising  about  one  fourth  of  the  poor  in  the  country.  The \nexpenditure-based poverty level in Osh in 2003  was estimated at 49% percent compared  to the national average of \n41%.  The  project  areas  include  Kara  Suu  and  Alai  raions  (districts).  Alai  raion  is  one  of  the  poorest  districts  in  the \ncountry,  and  of  its  surveyed  villages  the  unemployment  rate  is  estimated  at  70\u201395%  excluding  subsistence  farming \nand  occasional  and  part-time  work.  Deteriorated  roads  are  among  a  number  of  problems  impeding  sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. According to a survey conducted during project preparation, road improvement is \nranked as the most important action to reduce poverty (90%), followed by more jobs for local people (89%), increasing \nallowances and pensions with inflation (80%), and better access to distant markets (71%). Only 55% of the surveyed \nhouseholds currently transport their products to markets due to the poor road. Due to the limited access to markets, \nthey have been consuming very few varieties of foods, causing health problems. Almost all the households, including \nthe poor, believe the improved roads will (i) enable more local goods to be transported to distant markets; (ii) enable \nmore  goods  from  outside  to  be  available  in  local  markets  and  shops;  (iii)  increase  traffic  flow;  (iv)  reduce  time  for \ntransport; (v) reduce the number of accidents; (vi) reduce the damage to goods being transported; and (vii) enhance \nthe  communication  between  villages  and  the  oblast  center.  Villagers  indicated  that  they  plan  to  diversify  their \nagricultural  production  to  higher  value  crops  and  enhance  livestock  activities  following  road  improvement;  develop \nprocessing industries, such as wood, leather, and potatoes; establish a handicraft industry for women (e.g., beddings \nand  carpet);  and  increase  provision  of  roadside  services  and  transport  services.  Also,  traders  in  Gulcha  and  Osh \nmarkets indicated that they would go more often to the project area to buy local products. The result of all these could \nimprove the terms of trade of poor farmers.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  about  67,000  people,  including  about  38,000  poor.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \npoverty reduction by facilitating trade; facilitating transport of local agricultural produce to markets; improving access to \nsocial  services;  creating  jobs  for  project  implementation;  reducing  transport  costs;  providing  income  generation \nopportunities  through  construction  of  a  roadside  station;  and  maximizing  the  poverty-reduction  benefits  from  other \nprojects being implemented in the project area. The Project also includes construction of a roadside station, which will \nreduce  poverty  by  providing  employment  opportunities  and  also  a  site  for  selling  local  products.  Complementary \npoverty  reduction  activities  in  the  project  area  include  microfinance,  physical  and  social  infrastructure  projects,  and \nsmall-scale  business  development,  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  bilateral  government \ndevelopment  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  Government,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and \nthe World Bank. \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA detailed survey of 300 households was conducted during project preparation along the road from Osh to Irkeshtam. \nConsultation  meetings  were  held  in  ten  villages  among  people  with  different  socioeconomic  backgrounds.  Local \nresidents indicated strong support for the Project, with high expectations of opportunities for income generation. The \nFact-Finding  Mission  also  consulted  with  local  residents,  village  heads,  regional  and  local  officials,  nongovernment \norganizations, local consultants, and international organizations. All of them support the Project. \n \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe contractors will be encouraged to maximize use of local labor, subcontractors, and local materials. Monitoring of \nsocial and economic progress is included in project supervision services. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \nAlthough  not  cited  as  a  major  concern  in  the  social  survey,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human trafficking are new and increasing problems in the Osh region. While \nthe  overall  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  remains  relatively  low,  the  number  of  cases  in  the  region  has  been  increasing \nrapidly. By increasing transit traffic following project completion and the number of foreign workers during construction, \nthe Project may contribute to the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking problems and therefore negatively impact women. \nOther than the HIV/AIDS and trafficking issues, the Project will have no adverse impact on vulnerable groups and no \nnegative implication for gender concerns.  \n  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  To  mitigate  the  potential  impact  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted \ninfection (STI) and human trafficking issues, an advisory technical assistance (TA) is being provided (Appendix 9). In \naddition,  the  project  supervision  consultants  will  include  a  domestic  consultant  to  provide  training  and  increase \nawareness  of  these  issues.  The  contractors  will  distribute  information  to  project  workers,  and  the  Project  will \ncoordinate  with  international  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  involved  in  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking \nprevention activities. The domestic consultant will be an expert on gender, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking to help the \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communications  ensure  that  critical  and  gender-relevant  issues  are  addressed  during \nproject implementation. These issues include women's participation during all phases of project implementation, and \nprovision of equal employment and wage opportunities for women employed in the project sites. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\nE.

Fees  will  only \nbe  charged  for  vehicles  crossing  international  borders, \nwhich are primarily trucks carrying freight. \n\nThe use of local labor, especially of the poor and women, \nand local subcontractors will be encouraged. \n\nThe population of the project area consists of (1999): \nKyrgyz, 94.6%; Uzbek, 4.3%; and others including \nUygurs, Russians, Tajiks, and Tatars, 1.1%. Although \ncultures and languages of these groups differ, there are \nmany similarities and historically they have lived in the \nsame region. Also, all groups were integrated into the \neconomic and social structure of the former Soviet Union \nfrom the 1920s through the 1980s. \nThe  attached  TA  will  mitigate  the  risk  of  increased \ntransmission  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  and  increased  levels \nof  human  trafficking.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to \ndistribute  materials  designed  to  prevent  the  spread  of \nsexually transmitted diseases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \n \n\nLoan/TA/ \nProject \nNumber \n\n \n \nProject Name \n\nLoan/TA \nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \nDate \nApproved \n\n \n \n\nTotal \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of the Road Sector \n\nA.

Consulting services will be conducted over 12 months, \nrequiring approximately 20 person-months of international and 105 person-months of domestic \ninput.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  provide  equipment,  office  supplies,  and  instruments  required  for \nthe TA implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged through a consulting firm \nfollowing the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used,  and  a  simplified \ntechnical proposal will be requested from the consulting firms. \n \nC.  \n \n3. \n\u041c\u041e\u0422C  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  \u0422\u0410.  MOTC's \nproject implementation unit will serve as the liaison between \u041c\u041e\u0422C and the consultants, and be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  management.

The  estimates  should  take  into  account  the  mountainous \ntopography of the country, design standards of the roads, and techniques for minimizing costs \n(e.g., labor-intensiveness, type of equipment). \n \nPrepare estimates of total maintenance costs for each category of roads prepared under \n6. \ntask  1,  in  terms  of  total  recommended  for  sufficient  maintenance  to  keep  current  conditions, \nminimal amount necessary to keep passable, etc.  \n \nBased  on  the  total  amount  of  financing  likely  under  current/projected  (next  5  years) \n7. \nbudget conditions, prepare recommended allocation of maintenance financing by road category \nand implications for the overall network. \n \nPrepare  a  methodology  for  allocating  maintenance  funds for  each  category  of  roads  in \n8. \nthe  future.  The  methodology  would  provide  a  basis/formulas  that  could  be  applied  to  any \nallocation  of  maintenance  to  ensure  that  whatever  financing  is  available  is  allocated  to  the \nhighest priority roads and thus used most effectively. \n \n9. \nPrepare  proposals  for  alternative  means  of  maintaining  MOTC  roads  that  do  not  rely \nsubstantially on financing from the national budget, for example, applying to national roads the \ncommunity-based  maintenance  techniques  prepared  under  the  institutional  strengthening  TA \n(footnote 1). \n \n \n \n10. \nmanagement structures, and practices used to maintain the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtan road. \n \n11. \nTaking  into  account  work  done  under  previous  ADB  TAs,  design  a  maintenance \nmanagement  system  appropriate  to  the  harsh  physical  conditions  of  the  road,  and  the \nmanagement structure of the corridor. The system should address the following: (i) routine road \ncondition  monitoring  (e.g.,  only  by  visible  survey  and/or  using  robust  equipment);  (ii)  traffic \ncounting and axle weighing (e.g., pneumatic counting, but no weigh-in-motion); (iii) road safety \nmonitoring  and  improvements;  (iv)  allowance  for  exceptional  climatic  conditions,  the  normal \nseasonality,  and  routine  winter  maintenance;  (v)  projections  of  pavement  deterioration,  and \nidentification and special attention to sections sensitive to snow drifting, erosion, flooding, etc.; \n(vi)  programming  of  maintenance  actions  on  a  responsive  and  timely  basis;  (vii)  emergency \nvehicle recovery (after breakdown) and rescue services from isolated sections of the road; (viii) \ncost  estimates  of  maintenance  requirements,  using  whatever  basis  best  matches  the \ncontracting  arrangements;  (ix)  services  and  works  procurement  by  force  account,  unit  rate \ncontracting,  performance  contracting,  or  combinations  of  these;  and  (x)  quality  procedures  for \nmaintenance  works  (possibly  involving  user  groups,  and  the  corridor  regional  executive \nmanagement agency). A maintenance management system should be developed, and training \nprovided to MOTC staff in Osh and in Bishkek in collaboration with local staff. \n \nReview existing model conditions of contracts for the maintenance services, and works \n12. \ncontracts in use in or developed for the Kyrgyz Republic, including the Bishkek-Osh road, and \ndraft  any  suggested  changes.

Develop a plan for the use of this and other available equipment. \nThe  plan  should  consider  leasing  or  rental  or  direct  works,  and  include  (i)  optimal  use  of  the \nequipment to maintain an appropriate level of service of the road; (ii) programmed maintenance \nof the equipment itself and avoidance of wasteful or abusive use, and rapid depreciation through \nneglected  maintenance;  (iii)  limitations  on  the  use  of  the  equipment  for  purposes  other  than \nmaintenance  of  the  project  road  (in  discussion  with  the  Government  and  ADB);  (iv)  financial \nprovision  for  the  eventual  renewal  of  the  equipment;  (v)  training  of  staff  in  programming  the \nmaintenance  of  equipment,  spares,  procurement,  etc;  (vi)  training  in  the  costing  of  use  of  the \nequipment; and (vii) drafting of the legal instruments required to set up the entity, which will own \nthe  equipment.  Labor-based  maintenance  methods  are  to  be  encouraged,  to  maximize \nemployment opportunities for the communities living along the road corridor. \n \n14. \nthe  existing \ntransformation \nmaintenance  management  assets  and  structures,  into  a  technical  or  contracts  management \ndepartment  of  the  corridor.

Check \ntheir preliminary acceptability with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance.  \n\n2. \n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nCorridor Regional Executive Management Agency \n\n \nOrganize two workshops or conferences in Bishkek during the course of the Project to \n16. \ndiscuss the establishment of a corridor regional executive management agency. Delegates are \nto be invited from the People's Republic of China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, in addition to the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  purpose  of  the  agency  would  include  promotion  of  coordinated  regional \neconomic  development  along  the  Fergana  Valley-Kashgar  corridor,  including  the  project  road. \nBased  on  the  results  of  the  conferences,  provide  follow-up  support  to  establish  the  corridor \nregional executive management agency, including estimating its annual administrative cost, and \nhow to integrate its organization and functioning with the corridor. The ultimate aim would be to \nmerge the regional agency with the corridor management department. \n \n\nc. \n\nTraffic Facilitation \n\n \nExamine with the Government the present border-crossing, border-security issues, and \n17. \ncross-border-trading  restraints, including  security  controls, customs  procedures,  and  any  other \nnonphysical impediments to traffic. Assess the limitations that these place on the development \nof traffic, and quantify the effect this will have on traffic levels, toll collection, and the success of \nthe corridor. Prepare a draft action plan to address these impediments. \n \n\n \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Management and Analysis \n(international, 5 person-months and domestic, 20 person-months) \n\na. \n\nReview and Update of Corridor Analysis \n\n \nReview  the  corridor  analysis,  prepared  under  the  regional  TA2  including  the  corridor \n18. \nregional  executive  management  agency  recommendations,  traffic  forecast,  and  financial \nprojections  including  projected  debt  repayment  and  maintenance  costs.  Update  the  traffic \nforecasts  and  financial  projections.  Update  the  cash-flow  projections,  including  the  various \noptions  for  toll  rates.  Establish  spreadsheets  to  revise  these  projections,  as  necessary,  for \ndiscussions with the Government and throughout the Project. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSetting and Collection of Tolls \n\n \n19. \nTaking  into  account  the  revised  cash-flow  projections,  discuss  with  the  Government  (i) \nthe  toll  levels,  and  (ii)  the  mechanisms  for  imposing  tolls  (e.g.,  transformation  of  the  existing \npermit system, establishment of toll booths). Help the Government prepare a proposal on tolls \nand their collection for ADB approval. Develop mechanisms to ensure that payments for use of \nthe  road  are  only  collected  by  the  corridor  authority,  e.g.,  by  linking  this  activity  and  the \ninstitutional structure. Prepare draft Government regulations on decrees prohibiting the exaction \nof any payments from users by any other government agencies or authorities, and to empower \nonly the corridor authority with policing of the road. Draft the regulatory or legislative instruments \nnecessary for the toll collection and check their acceptability. \n \n\nc. \n\nFinancial Management \n\nCounterpart Facilities \n\n \n20. \nRecommend  a  financial  management  structure  and  accounting  system  for  the  corridor \nagency,  assuring  the  need  for  absolute  transparency  of  the  financial  management  of  the \ncorridor.

The real number of cases of HIV infection is estimated \nto  be  at  least  10  times  higher  and  mostly  among  intravenous  drug  addicts.  Also,  due  to  its \ngeographic location, the Kyrgyz Republic is the country of origin and transit of potential victims \nof  human  trafficking,  in  particular  in  areas  near  the  boundary  and  in  remote  southern  areas. \nAbout  4,000  women  annually  were  reported  to  become  victims  of  human  trafficking  in  1999.3 \nThe Southern Transport Corridor Road Rehabilitation Project may have an impact on the spread \nof HIV/AIDS, STI (sexually transmitted infection), and human trafficking through a large number \nof  workers  employed  during  rehabilitation  and  the  increased  movement  of  traffic  after  project \ncompletion.4  \n \nB. \n \nThe goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to reduce the risks of increasing HIV/AIDS, \n2. \nSTIs, and human trafficking that may be associated with the rehabilitation of the Osh-Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam  road  and  operation  of  the  road  transport  corridor  after  project  completion.  The \npurpose  of  the  TA  is  to  raise  public  awareness  and  address  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs \nlocal \ntransmission  and  human \ncommunities, truck drivers, border officers, and other road users. The TA will focus on capacity \nbuilding by utilizing international expertise in addressing HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking, \nconcentrating on HIV/AIDS through sexual transmission rather than injection drug use, which is \nthe main mode of HIV transmission in general, as road projects tend to be associated more with \nsexual transmission.5 \n \n3. \nThe  TA  will  build  on  the  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Government  and  other  agencies, \nparticularly  the  Global  Fund  for  the  Fight  against  HIV/AIDS,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  World  Bank,  which  are \nthe  major  actors  supporting  the  national  HIV/AIDS  control  program,  and  International \nOrganization  for  Migration,  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,  and  (United \nStates Agency for International Development funded) Winrock International as key contributors \nto  the  Government  programs  for  human  trafficking  prevention.6 If  an  HIV/AIDS  case  is  found \nunder  the  TA,  the  case  will  be  linked  with  care  and  support  programs  provided  by  the  Global \nFund,  other  agencies,  and  the  Government.  The  TA  will  complement  the  national  program  by \nsupporting a risk zone approach.  \n\ntrafficking  among  construction  workers,  sex  workers, \n\n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  According to Global Fund and National AIDS Center. \n3  Source: International Organization for Migration. \n4  Mobile  populations  are  among  the  main  transmitters  of  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Construction  workers,  transport \n\nworkers, truck drivers, and traders compose key mobile groups.  \n\n5  According to an official of United Nations Development Fund for Women. Also, drug trafficking is addressed by the \n\nNational Drug Control Agency. \n\n6  This includes information and education campaigns, STI services, the condom use program, provision of voluntary \ncounseling and testing services, surveillance systems, training on law enforcement, establishment of check points \nat the borders, and regional cooperation on the fight against HIV/AIDS.  \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45\n\n \n4. \nThe TA comprises five components, to be undertaken primarily in the road project area: \npromotion  of  behavior  change,  clinical  support,  human  trafficking  prevention,  advocacy \nworkshops  and  policy  development,  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  in \nrehabilitation areas. \n \n5. \nPromotion  of  Behavior  Change.  Intensive  health  education  campaigns  and  peer \neducation  will  be  undertaken  to  promote  behavior  change  among  construction  workers,  sex \nworkers, and local people in the project area. Knowledge will be disseminated through posters, \npamphlets,  focus  groups,  and  launch  events  in  Kyrgyz,  Chinese,  Russian,  and  Uzbek \nlanguages  during  the  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road.  Peer  education  supporters  such  as \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  identified  to  facilitate  education  for  sex  workers. \nThe  TA  consultant  team  will  help  the  local  health  departments  and  the  construction  firm \norganize peer education through sensitization workshops, initial training, and regular monitoring \nvisits. Condoms will be made available free of charge to the construction workers, sex workers, \ncommunities,  and  border  officers  during  the  first  year  of  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road.  The \nTA will cover additional requirements of the mobile populations to augment condom distribution \nprograms of other agencies. \n \n6. \nClinical Support. The TA will conduct training for health workers on STIs management \nand voluntary counseling and testing services. STIs treatment packages and HIV testing kits will \nbe  provided  to  clinics  in  the  project  area  to  help  them  meet  incremental  needs  of  the  mobile \npopulations and will complement existing national activities supported by other agencies.  \n\n \nHuman  Trafficking  Prevention. Training in HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking will \n7. \nbe  provided  to  border  officers  in  the  Osh  region.  The  consultants  will  work  with  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  local  institutes,  and  NGOs  for  capacity  building.  Workshops  will  be \norganized  for  relevant  participants  to  discuss  activities  to  combat  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking, and establish a coordination network on human trafficking prevention.  \n\n \n8. \nAdvocacy  Workshops  and  Policy  Development.  To  improve  understanding  of  the \nawareness  and  prevention  program  on  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking  among \nstakeholders,  advocacy  workshops  will  be  conducted,  including  information  and  education \ncampaigns.  The  workshops  will  target  local  governments  and  communities,  local  business \nowners, relevant NGOs, transport operators, media, local police, road construction companies, \nand the local units of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). The TA will also \nhelp  developing  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  policies  for  construction  companies  and  transportation \ncompanies in the road project. \n \n9. \nPerformance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  in  Rehabilitation  Areas.  A  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system, including a project performance management system, will be \nset up to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the TA and to improve the TA performance. \nIn  addition  to  performance  indicators,  sexual  behavior;  treatment-seeking  behavior;  and \nincidences  of  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking  will  be  monitored.  Surveys  with  local \nresidents and other stakeholders in the road project will be conducted to collect baseline data \nand assess progress. Training on monitoring and surveillance system will be provided. \n \nC. \n \n10. \n \n\nThe estimated costs of the TA and the proposed financing plan are given in Table A9.  \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nItem \n\nA.

Traffic counts \nby the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the 2001 European Union-TRACECA2 study \nof  the  road,  and  from  the  TRACECA  database  were  used  to  determine  appropriate  base-year \ntraffic. \n \n2. \nAverage traffic volumes (in vehicles per day) on the project road sections in 2002 were \n641 vehicles per day on the Osh-Gulcha section, and 512 on the Gulcha-Sopu Korgon section. \nTrucks  comprised  42%  of  traffic  on  the  Osh-Gulcha  section  and  52%  on  the  Gulcha-Sopu \nKorgon section. Cars comprised 56% and 47% of traffic on the Osh-Gulcha and Gulcha-Sopu \nKorgon sections, respectively. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  and  type  of  traffic  (normal,  diverted,  and  generated) \nwere  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2005\u20132027.  The  forecasts  are  based  on \nexpected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product,  on  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  freight  and \npassenger vehicles, and on expected future trade patterns. Gross domestic product is estimated \nto  grow  at  annual  rates  of  4.5%.  Income  elasticities  of  demand  of  1.4,  1.2,  and  1.0  are  for \nnormal traffic, and used for cars, buses, and trucks, respectively. Elasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are \napplied to passenger and freight vehicles, respectively, for the remainder of the project period. \n \n4. \nBased  on  forecast  gross  domestic  product  growth,  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and \nexpected  trade  patterns  over  the  total  project  period,  average  annual  traffic  growth  rates  for \nbuses, cars, and trucks are estimated at 6.3%, 5.4%, and 4.5% during 2005\u20132015, and 3.0% for \nall vehicles during the remainder of the project period. Volumes of traffic forecast on the project \nroad sections are summarized in Table A10.1.

In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  receive  only \nminimal maintenance and to continue to deteriorate. The with-project scenario includes routine \nand  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The  regional  technical \nassistance  (TA)  that  prepared  the  Project  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives,  and  the  Project  is  based  on  the  most  cost-effective  and  least-cost  option.  The \neconomic analysis covers 23 years (2005\u20132027), based on an implementation period of a little \nmore than 3 years. All benefits and costs are in constant 2004 prices. The economic prices are \nexpressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB. \n \nimprovement  and \ninclude \n2. \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies, \ninterest  during \nconstruction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and \nnontradable  portions.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  the  nontradable \nportion. To account of local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  Project\u2019s  primary  economic  benefits  are  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings  for \nnormal traffic, generated domestic traffic, reduction of road closing times due to improved winter \nmaintenance, benefits from increased agricultural income, and border-crossing fees. Economic \nbenefits were calculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue \nprimarily  from  improvements  in  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and \nincreased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for five types of vehicles were \nestimated using the highway design and maintenance standards model, and are shown in Table \nA11.1.  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  account  for  about  48%  of  total  benefits  accruing  to  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  benefits  from  border-crossing  fees  account  for  about  41%.  Generated \ntraffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in  transport  costs  arising  from  the \nProject. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. \n \n\nBenefits \n\nTable A11.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km) \n \n\nWithout Project \n\n Item \n2-Axle Truck \n3-Axle Truck \n>3-Axle Truck \nSmall Bus \nCar \n> =  more than, km = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nNote: VOCs are for the Osh-Gulcha road section in 2008. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nWith Project \n125.3 \n237.9 \n321.3 \n115.5 \n66.5 \n\n144.7 \n262.9 \n369.6 \n134.5 \n71.4 \n\n \n\nVOC Savings \n\n19.4 \n25.0 \n48.3 \n19.0 \n4.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  Project  includes  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  for  the  entire  road  from \n4. \nOsh  to  Irkeshtam,  and  the  associated  TA  will  assist  in  managing  maintenance  and  other \noperations  on  the  road.  Improved  maintenance  will  result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  road \nclosures  during  winter.  On  the  Osh-Sopu  Korgon  section, the  road  is  expected  to  be  open  an \nadditional 4% of the year, which will result in additional traffic. Upon project completion, border-\ncrossing fees will be collected, replacing the fees charged for permits under the current system. \nThe fees paid by non-Kyrgyz residents represent benefits to the Kyrgyz Republic. Non-Kyrgyz \ntraffic is expected to comprise 50% of the vehicles crossing the border, and the fee anticipated \nto be $20 per crossing. The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. Benefits from \nincreased agricultural income arise from the higher prices that farmers will be able to obtain for \ntheir  produce  through  improved  access  to  markets.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits, \nsuch  as  time  savings,  improved  road  safety,  and  improved  access  to  social  services,  which \nhave not been quantified. \n \n5. \nThe Project will also result in benefits to other countries from international generated and \ndiverted traffic, which are not included in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation \nas they don't accrue to the Kyrgyz Republic. International generated traffic comprises new traffic \narising  from  increased  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  People's  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), and Uzbekistan resulting from improvement of the project road, and to a lesser degree, \nnew international traffic to and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Diverted traffic comprises traffic \ndiverted from two existing routes: Uzbekistan-Russian Federation and Uzbekistan-PRC. Traffic \non the Uzbekistan- Russian Federation route would divert to the PRC\u2019s sources of supply and \ndemand  due  to  the  much  shorter  distances  once  the  project  road  is  rehabilitated.  Similarly, \nUzbekistan-PRC  traffic  now  using  the  route  through  Kazakhstan  would  divert  to  the  shorter \nroute using the project road. The present value of the benefits from international generated and \ndiverted traffic is estimated at $123 million. \n \nD. \n \n6. \n13.3% and the net present value is $3.0 million (Table A11.2).  \n \n\nThe  EIRR  for  the  Project,  including  only  benefits  accruing  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  is \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Project Road  \nSections including Benefits to the Kyrgyz Republic \n($ million) \n \n\n \n \nYear \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n\n \n\n \n\nCapital  Maint. \nCosts \nCosts \n  5.012 \n  11.694 \n  11.694 \n  5.012 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n  0.000 \n\n \nTotal \nCosts \n  0.000    5.012 \n  0.000    11.694 \n  0.000    11.694 \n  0.103    5.114 \n  0.103    0.103 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.445    0.445 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.716    0.716 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.117    0.117 \n  0.117    0.117 \n\nBenefits \n\n \nNet \n\n \n\nNormal Gen.

The sensitivity analysis, shown \nin  Table  A11.3,  indicates  that  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  13%  or  total  benefits \ndecrease by 11% for the EIRR to reach the cutoff level of 12%. The risks of the EIRR declining \nbelow  12%  are  mitigated  by  the  uncomplicated  nature  of  the  rehabilitation  works,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank's experience with similar projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and other Central \nAsian republics, and the conservative assumptions used in the analysis. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the EIRR meets or exceeds the cutoff level in all cases. Normal traffic would have to \ndecrease by 22% for the EIRR to drop to 12%.  \n \n\nTable A11.3: Sensitivity Analysis  \n \n\nSwitching \nValue \n(%) \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n Item \nBase case \nOne-year implementation delay \nBorder fees\u201410% \nNormal traffic\u201410% \nTotal benefit\u201410% \nCapital costs plus 10% \nNormal traffic\u201410%; capital costs plus 10% \nWithout generated traffic \nWithout winter maintenance benefits \nWithout agricultural income \nWithout cross-border fees \nMaintenance at 50% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource:  Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nENPV \n3.035  \n1.383  \n1.859  \n1.625  \n0.196  \n0.626  \n(0.784) \n2.786  \n2.493  \n0.767  \n(8.731) \n(1.134) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n13.3 \n12.6 \n12.8 \n12.7 \n12.1 \n12.3 \n11.7 \n13.2 \n13.1 \n12.3 \n8.0 \n11.4 \n\n  \n\n25 \n22 \n11 \n13 \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n \nF. \n \n8. \nDistribution  analysis  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  Project\u2019s  primary  beneficiaries \nusing  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price  numeraire, \nconstant price, and standard conversion factor adjustment. The project benefits are distributed \namong five  national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) \nvehicle  owners,  (iv)  laborers,  and  (v)  the  economy/Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \ngroups  receiving  the  largest  shares  of  the  benefits  are  the  economy/Government  and  freight \n\n \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nusers. The large share accruing to the economy/Government arises from the benefits from the \nborder-crossing fees. The large share accruing to freight users is due to the large share of VOC \nsavings  accounted  for  by  trucks  and  the  competitive  nature  of  the  Kyrgyz  trucking  industry, \nwhich  makes  it  likely  that  the  VOC  savings  will  be  passed  on  to  users  in  the  form  of  reduced \nfares.

The \nGovernment has agreed that the fees will be set at a minimum of Som850 per vehicle crossing \n(about $20). The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. The Government has also \nagreed that the revenue from the fees will be used to finance operation and maintenance of the \nOsh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam transport corridor and that any excess revenue will be used to finance \nmaintenance of other roads under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. \nEstimates  of  revenues  from  the  border-crossing  fees  and  corridor  maintenance  and  operating \ncosts are shown in Table A11.5. The estimates are based on the minimum fee of Som850 per \ncrossing  and  the  traffic  forecast  in  Appendix  10.  The  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were \nprepared  under  the  TA  and  include  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs  for  the  entire \ncorridor, not only the project sections.

The existing road consists of two traffic lanes and is paved with asphaltic \nconcrete for most of the length from Osh (0 km) to Sary Tash (km 185).The remaining 73 km \nfrom  Sary  Tash  to  Irkeshtam  has  only  gravel  surfacing.  During  rehabilitation,  the  construction \nprocess will take place almost entirely within the existing right-of-way, but will also include some \nflattening of cut slopes and minor widening of the roadway to extend horizontal sight distance. \nMeasures to control severe erosion, landslides, avalanches, and rockfalls will be a major cost of \nconstruction  requiring  the  use  of  gabions,  dumped  rock,  and  other  standard  engineering \npractices  to  provide  slope  stabilizations.  In  addition  to  new  pavement,  other  work  items  are \nrepair  of  bridges  and  culverts;  striping  of  pavement;  provision  of  guardrails  and  signage;  and \nrebuilding of longitudinal drainage channels. \n \nC. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  landlocked  country  located  in  the  middle  of  Central  Asia \n3. \nbordering the People's Republic of China (PRC) (858 km), Kazakhstan (105 km), Tajikistan (870 \nkm),  and  Uzbekistan  (1,099  km).  The  total  area  of  the  country  is  198,500  square  kilometers \n(km2), of which waters count for less than 4% (7,200 km2). High snowcapped mountains, deep \ngorges,  and  fertile  valleys  are  the  principal  physical  characteristics  of  the  country.  The \nelevations range from less than 500 meters (m) in the Fergana Valley in the southeast, to 7,439 \nm in the northeast. Besides Lake Issyk-Kul, the second deepest mountain lake in the world, the \ncountry has very few natural lakes, but many artificial lakes and reservoirs originally constructed \nfor  hydroelectric  power  or  irrigation.  In  addition  to  big  rivers,  innumerable  streams  and  creeks \nrun  from  the  hills  and  mountains  down  to  the  valleys.  The  climate  is  continental,  though  quite \nvariable due to the extreme differences in altitude. The Osh to Irkeshtam road passes through \nthe  country\u2019s  two  climatic  zones.  From  Osh,  the  climate  is  arid  with  limited  and  discrete \n(irrigated) fertile areas. The area is classified as dry steppe. The route then climbs up and over \nthe Chygyrchyk Pass and down to Gulcha in temperate steppe country. The section of the route \nalong  the  Gulcha  Valley  reverts  to  dry  steppe,  and  at  Taldyk  Pass  becomes  tundra,  which \nremains  the  same  through  Sary  Tash  until  close  to  the  PRC  border  to  a  small  pocket  of  dry \nsteppe.  Precipitation  in  the  different  zones  varies  considerably.  It  is  highest  in  the  mountains \n(more  than  1,000  millimeters(mm)/year)  and  lowest  in  the  valleys  (less  than  230  mm/year  in \nsome cases). \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  many  natural  resources,  for  example,  coal,  peat,  some  rare \n4. \nmetals  (including  gold),  and  uranium.  It  has  many  mineral  and  thermal  springs,  some  of  them \nclose  to  the  project  road,  but  not  close  enough  to  be  threatened  by  the  rehabilitation  works. \nMost  of  these  resources,  together  with  medicinal  mud,  are  located  in  the  eastern  part  of  the \ncountry, especially around Lake Issyk-Kul, far from the project area. Forests cover only a minor \npart (3.9%) of the country. The area of forests has been reduced somewhat during the last 10 \nyears. Although trees are present along much of the length of the project road, only one area of \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nthe Forest Fund of Kyrgyz Republic (forest reserve) is actually traversed by the road. This area \nis  located  near  the  Taldyk  Pass  between  Gulcha  and  Sary  Tash  (beyond  the  sections  of  the \nroad  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project).  But  the  road  has  no  impact  on  the  forest.  The \ncountry\u2019s ecology is diverse in its relief, climatic conditions, flora, and fauna. Many animal and \nplant species are concentrated in relatively small areas and are therefore especially vulnerable. \nThe  deserts,  occupying  less  area  than  the  steppes,  feature  different  grasses  and  bushes, \nprincipally wormwood as the dominant vegetation, but the vegetation in the valleys and foothills \nis more diverse. The fauna of Kyrgyz Republic is relatively varied and nonhomogeneous in its \norigin.  The  known  species  of  vertebrates  include  more  than  40  kinds  of  fish,  3  kinds  of \namphibians, 28 reptiles, plus some 350 birds and 78 mammals. The animals of the deserts and \nsemideserts are limited in their composition of types, the result of the poor living conditions and \nthe  small  total  areas  involved.  On  the  other  hand,  the  steppes  are  rich  in  animals,  both  in \nnumber  and  species,  as  a  result  of  the  favorable  living  conditions.  However,  as  the  steppes \nhave  been  taken  over  for  use  as  pastures  and  cultivation,  major  changes  have  occurred  that \nhave adversely affected the animal habitats of the steppes. Considerable desertified areas have \nresulted from overpasturing and inappropriate farming methods.  \n \n5. \nThe project area also has diverse environmental characteristics. The initial point, at an \nelevation of 1,000 m above sea level, is outside Osh, a famed historical trading center close by \nthe  Uzbekistan  border,  and  which  has  now  become  the  major  city  in  the  southern  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  with  a  population  of  over  200,000.  From  Osh,  the  road  follows  a  southerly  direction \nalong  the  Taldyk  River,  through  the  easterly  end  of  the  fertile  Fergana  Valley,  a  quite  heavily \npopulated area with well-established vegetation, before crossing Chygyrchyk Pass (elevation 2, \n408  m).  The  road  then  descends and  connects  with  Gulcha  (km  80),  a  town  of  approximately \n16,500 people, which serves as the administrative center of Alai raion. Due to the prevalent red \nclay  and  silt  soils,  the  area  of  Chygyrchyk  is  prone  to  mudflows  and  slumps  of  the  unstable \nslopes. Overgrazing of the sparse vegetation is a possible cause. After Gulcha, elevation 1,500 \nm, the road direction is southerly along the Gulcha River, ascending at a low grade toward Talyk \nPass.  Sopu  Korgon,  the  termination  of  the  Project,  lies  before  the  Taldyk  Pass.  The  Gulcha \nRiver is crossed several times, and the road passes through four small villages before arriving \nat the base of the ascent to Taldyk Pass (elevation 2,900 m). A series of switchbacks then lifts \nthe road up to the summit of the pass at elevation 3,615 m. Under future projects, major work \nwill be needed on this pass and its approaches to control erosion and provide protection against \nfrequent avalanches. The road continues southeasterly, and then employs serpentines to drop \n600 m in 10 km to Sary Tash (population 1, 590), located on a high mountain plateau with an \narid  environment.  At  Sary  Tash,  a  junction  leads  to  the  border  with  Tajikistan,  and  a  vista  of \nstark,  alpine  beauty  in  a  pristine,  practically  uninhabited  area,  with  almost  no  flora.  The  only \nhabitation is in the village of Nura with a population of 200. The grades are gentle until the final \n10 km, where severe hairpin bends bring the road down to the existing border customs facility at \nelevation 2,500 m. No alternative routings will be allowed to preserve the fragile environment. \n \nD. \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Location \n\n \n6. \nRehabilitation  activities  will  be  confined  to  the  existing  right-of-way  of  the  road.  The \nProject  will  not  have  any  negative  environmental  impact  on  archaeologically  significant  sites, \nnature  protection  areas,  or  other  culturally  important  sites  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  No \nsignificant  changes  of  the  hydrological  characteristics  of  the  project  area  are  expected.  The \naltered road embankment, borrow pits, and provisions for quarry operations, disposal sites, and \nminor  changes  in  delineation  to  improve  traffic  safety  will  not  require  permanent  land \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nacquisition.  In  some  of  the  road  sections,  landslides,  rockslides,  mudslides,  flooding,  or  soil \nsubsidence  pose  risks.  Erosion  control  of  the  embankments,  pavements,  and  other  road \nstructures  will  be  taken  into  account  everywhere  in  the  project  area,  in  accordance  with  the \nquality standards for the design and construction of the rehabilitation works. \n \n7. \nThe project road crosses the State Forest Reserve Bel-Ulim at one point, between Sopu \nKorgon and Sary Tash, beyond the sections being rehabilitated under the Project. It is located in \nthe  Osh  lezhos  of  Alai raion  of  Osh  Oblast.  The  mixed  forest  in  the  reserve  includes  the  Tien \nShan  spruce  series  (59.65  hectares  [ha]);  juniper  (179.9  ha);  birch  (23.65  ha);  and  Siberian \nlarch  (6  ha).  The  increased  traffic  resulting  from  the  Project  will  not  have  any  impact  on  the \nreserve. Furthermore, rehabilitation of this point of the road under future projects is not expected \nto have any significant impact on the reserve, as changes in the alignment are not anticipated. \nWhen final contract documents are completed, the local forestry official can make an accurate \ncount of any trees to be cut down. The number is anticipated to be very small. Improved access \nto the area will result in only minimal impacts. The only reported historic site is the birthplace of \nKurmanjan Datka, a famous female state official of the 19th century.  \n \n8. \nExisting  channels  and  culverts  will  be  analyzed  for  size  and  condition,  and  if  required, \nwill  be  repaired  or  replaced,  to  facilitate  the  passage  of  higher  storm  flows,  thus  reducing \nscouring and bank erosion in the vicinity of the road and ensuring the structural integrity of the \nroad. The project area has no ecologically important wetlands. The Project will have no impact \non groundwater resources. Construction supervision consultants will ensure that the contractor \ndoes not interfere with or obstruct any potable or irrigation water source. There will be little or no \nloss of habitat. Construction will take place within the existing right-of-way. Sites for contractor \nwork camps, batch plants, rock crushers, material storage, borrow pits and quarries will all be \napproved by the supervision consultants. There will be no interruptions of wildlife corridors, or \nhabitat fragmentations. No endangered species will be impacted by the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design \n\n \n9. \nEnvironmental  clearance  will  be  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Emergency \nSituations  (MEES),  the  central  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulatory  agency,  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness. No significant negative environmental impacts related to the design are foreseen, \nas long as the asphalt plants, camps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, \nand national planning standards are appropriately followed. Special attention needs to be paid \nto  the  design  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  workers  camps  and  to  monitoring  their  water  supply, \nwastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  and  overall  sanitary  conditions.  Where \nenvironmental impacts are expected, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the project \ndesign  documents.  The  largest  in  scope  and  the  most  costly  environmental  factor  to  be \nconfronted is erosion. Due to steep terrain, poor soils, and lack of vegetation to anchor the thin \nlayer of soil covering the rock, large-scale erosion is evident all along the road. The results are \nrockfalls, mudflows, hillside slumps, undermining of culverts and bridges, and wearing away of \nthe cross section at high fill areas. Mitigation measures proposed include stabilizing the slopes \nby  a  combination  of  gabions,  dumped  rock,  and  pitching.  Gabions  (rocks  placed  in  a  wire \ncontainer),  will  be  used  for  erosion  control,  and  as  retaining  walls  against  landslips.  Dumped \nrock  will  be  used  to  protect  against  erosion  along  embankment  footings  when  there  are  no \nspace  limitations.  Dry  stone  pitching  denotes  the  use  of  stone  up  to  300  mm  diameter  that  is \nplaced  without  grout  in  a  layer  on  a  slope  subject  to  erosion.  This  technique  is  especially \nbeneficial in erosion gullies, where the gully has been shaped to as flat a slope as possible. The \nuse of gabions and dry stone pitching are very labor intensive and will provide work for the local \ninhabitants.  Effort  will  be  made  to  limit  earthworks,  and  thus  to  minimize  the  development  of \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\naesthetically unappealing spoil dumps resulting from cut sections. Moreover, judicious reuse of \naggregate  screened  from  cut  materials  will  be  emphasized  to  limit  the  opening  of  quarries \n(borrow pits). \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction \n\n \n10. \nDetailed  requirements  for  upgrading  erosion  control  will  be  included  in  construction \ncontracts. Embankment slopes will be planted with grass or otherwise protected after the works \nhave  been  completed.  Newer  technologies  such  as  hydroseeding,  geotextiles,  and  drain  nets \ncan  be  used  in  locations  where  erosion  and  revegetation  are  difficult.  Replanting  work  will  be \ndone as soon as possible after borrow work is finished. Contracts will require that asphalt and \nhot-mix  plants  be  located  at  least  500  m  away  from  the  nearest  sensitive  receptors,  e.g., \nschools  and  hospitals.  Asphalt  will  be  purchased  from  permanent  factories.  Operators  will  be \nrequired to install noise and exhaust emission controls where applicable. Trucks carrying earth, \nsand, or similar construction materials or waste spoils will be covered to avoid dust and spills. \nCare  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic  disruptions  to  road \ntransport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed in the detailed \ndesign  and  implementation  planning  of  the  rehabilitation  works.  In  construction  staging  areas, \nequipment  and  vehicle  fueling  and  maintenance  may  cause  contamination  of  soil  and  surface \nwater unless controlled properly. Fuel storage and refilling areas will be at least 300 m from all \ncross-drainage  structures  and  important  water  bodies,  or  as  directed  by  the  engineer.  An  oil \ninterceptor will be provided for washing down and refueling areas. Fuel will be stored in properly \nprotected  areas.  Construction  material  storage  areas  will  have  appropriate  rainfall  control \nmeasures. Disposal of solid wastes into water bodies will be strictly prohibited. Waste oils from \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, and solid waste with oil sludge will be collectively treated. \n \n11. \nConstruction camps will have septic tanks and controlled solid waste disposal pits, which \nshould  be  closed  within  a  specified  time  after  construction.  Sewage  and  garbage  from \nconstruction  camps  will  be  collectively  treated  or  made  into  fertilizer.  Storm-water  retention \nbasins  will  be  constructed  to  prevent  pavement  runoff  from  directly  entering  surface  waters. \nBridges,  culverts,  and  drainage  ditches  will  be  designed  to  prevent  damage  to  local  irrigation \nsystems.  Culverts  and  drains  will  be  cleared  frequently  to  maintain  storm-water  flow. \nContractors  will  be  required  to  provide  basic  emergency  health  facilities  for  construction \nworkers. Moreover, the contractor will be required to conduct a vigorous public health program \nto  contain  such  contagious  diseases  as  enteric  dysentery,  malaria,  and  common  venereal \nmaladies.  Frequent  educational  meetings  will  be  held  to  inform  the  workers  of  the  sources  of \nthese diseases and to explain how they can be avoided. \n \n12. \nTo  ensure  contractors\u2019  compliance  with  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards, \nMEES  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  undertake  regular \ninspections.  Their  findings  will  be  attached  to  the  weekly  and  monthly  progress  reports,  with \ncomments on the possible response to emerging environmental concerns. The inspections will \ncover all relevant issues, including the use of appropriate materials and possible claims made \nby  the  affected  people.  Continuous  supervision  of  contractor  work  hours  and  practices  will  be \nrequired  during  the  construction  phase,  when  paving  machines,  rock  crushers,  and  rollers  will \nbe  in  operation.  A  few  sensitive  receptors  (i.e.,  schools  and  public  buildings)  were  noted,  but \nthese structures were a minimum of 30 m from the roadway. During construction, these facilities \nwill  undergo  a  temporary  adverse  impact  due  to  the  noise  of  the  construction  equipment. \nCooperation  between  the  contractor  and  the  local  residents  is  essential.  The  construction \nsurveillance  engineer  is  responsible  for  setting  up  meetings  between  these  parties  and \narranging such important matters as work schedules (hours of equipment operation, traffic lanes \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nto  be  kept  open,  etc.); locations  of work  camps  and  material  storage areas;  and siting  of  rock \ncrushers and batch plants, in accordance with established policies of MOTC and  incorporated \ninto the contract documents. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n\n \n13. \nRoad safety is expected to improve with the Project. Possible secondary benefits include \nreduction  of  car  accidents  and  reduced  spills  of  hazardous  chemicals  transported  by  trucks. \nDuring operations, contingency plans will be in place for cleaning up spills of oil, fuel, and toxic \nchemicals.  Maintenance  of  road  surfaces,  drainage  facilities,  and  landscaping  should  be \nenhanced to prevent soil erosion. No problem is anticipated with the expected increase of traffic \nafter  the  construction  is  completed.  Even  under  the  most  optimistic  scenario  of  increased \ncommercial  traffic,  the  ambient  noise  level  after  the  completion  of  construction  (operational \nperiod) will not be of sufficient magnitude to require acoustical mitigation. The Osh to Irkeshtam \nroad  does  not  pass  through  any  compact  towns,  and  no  particular  mitigation  measures  are \ntherefore  needed  at  this  stage  for  traffic  safety  and  emission  problems.  Since  better  road \nconditions lead to increased speed, the fatality rate of livestock will rise. Together with increased \ntraffic volume, this issue is worthy of recognition. \n \nE. \n \n14. \nSince independence, the Kyrgyz Republic has developed a framework of environmental \nlaws, regulations, and policies. These mandate that environmental impacts should be assessed; \nconsequences identified; ecological and economic studies carried out; and measures to mitigate \npossible  negative  impacts  should  be  identified  prior  to  the  implementation  of  a  project.  MEES \n(formerly  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection)  is  the  final  authority  for  environmental \napproval.  In  the  case  of  a  road  project,  the  contract  documents  are  forwarded  to  MEES  by \nMOTC after approval by the Forestry Department. The institutional capability of MOTC and its \nconsultants to  prepare engineering  designs  and  bid  documents  with substantial environmental \ncomponents has also developed. MOTC has several environmental responsibilities: \n \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nAssure,  during  the  design  phase,  that  all  critical  environmental  conditions  are \nacknowledged and mitigation measures are incorporated in the final design. \n\n(i) \n\nFollow environmental guidelines in siting asphalt plants, contractor work camps, \nand open storage areas, during preconstruction meetings involving the contractor \nand  representatives  of  MOTC,  MEES,  and  the  Forestry  Department,  Factors  to \nbe considered involve electric power, water supply, sewerage, and disposal sites \nfor solid wastes. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMonitor,  during  construction,  in  meetings  between  the  contractor  and  the  local \nofficials,  agreements  concerning  permanent  and  temporary  allocation  of  land \narea  for  road  construction,  quarries,  spoil  dumps,  contractor's  camps,  batching \nplants, and other material processing locations. \n\n \n15. \nRoutine  monitoring  during  construction  involves  continuous  supervision  of  contractor \nwork hours and practices based on agreements between the contractor and local officials. The \npurposes of these agreements include limiting the time in which heavy construction equipment \ncan be used in noise-sensitive environments; and establishing sanitation standards for the work \ncamps. No formal long-term environmental monitoring is necessary following the construction of \nthe  road.  The  formal  acceptance  of  the  works  following  the  completion  should  include  a  full \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61\n\nexamination of the contractor's compliance with the specified requirements for the protection of \nthe  environment.  This  should  include  verification  of  the  proper  cleanup  and  restoration  of  all \ntemporary  work  sites  (quarries,  camps,  etc.)  and  of  the  proper  landscaping,  planting,  and \ndraining of all borrow and spoil areas. In the longer term, the road authorities must monitor the \neffectiveness  of  the  erosion  and  rock  fall  protection  measures.  Some  form  of  reporting  should \nbe implemented to ensure that information regarding defects in design or construction methods \nis fed back to MOTC. Periodic assessments should be conducted of the fatality rate of livestock \nand  migratory  herds  due  to  traffic  impact.  Corrective  measures  (e.g.,  reduced  speed  zones) \nshould be taken if the frequency of such occurrences increases significantly. \n \n16. \nThe cost estimate for the recommended monitoring plan is $8,000 with one local monitor \nin a vehicle touring the road a total of three times. When the resident engineer tours the work \nsite  for  the  final  inspection,  an  environmental  engineer  could  verify  that  the  final  clean  up  is \nsatisfactory  on  all  quarries,  contractor  work  camps,  and  spoil  disposal  areas.  In  addition,  the \nenvironmental engineer could validate that culverts, drainage ditches, and surface watercourses \nhave  not  been  blocked;  side  slopes  are  stable;  and,  wherever  possible,  removed  trees  have \nbeen replanted. Two more follow-up monitoring visits will be conducted at 3-month intervals. \n \nF. \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n1. \n\nPublic Consultation  \n\n \n17. \nA participatory social impact assessment has been made and is discussed in Appendix \n3. Widespread approval for the Project is reported. The residents believe they will get short-term \nbenefits  by  gaining  jobs  during  the  construction  phases,  then  long-term  benefits  through \nincreased  access  for  their  products  to  the  markets.  Some  long-term  service  businesses  with \nemployment  opportunities  are  expected, \nroadside  cafes  and  gas \nstations/maintenance centers.

To  the  extent  possible,  use  gabions,  dumped  rock,  and  pitching  to \nstabilize  slopes  and  limit  the  construction  of  heavy  reinforced  concrete  or \nmasonry  retaining  walls  and  buttresses.  Although  some  slopes  will  be  flattened \nand minimal widening of the road provided in hazardous areas, every  effort will \nbe made to limit the work to the existing right-of-way. The goal is to reduce the \nvolumes  of  cut  and  fill,  thus  limiting  the  number  and  scope  of  unsightly  spoil \ndumps and borrow pits. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAir  quality  and  noise  pollution.  During  the  construction  phase,  guidelines  on \nwork  hours  should  be  imposed  on  the  contractor  to  limit  inconveniences  to \nresidents dwelling near the work sites.  \n\nMOTC  will  ensure  that  the  contractor  does  not  interfere  with  or  obstruct  any \npotable  or  irrigation  water  source,  and  that  the  contractor  will  site  camps  and \nindustrial areas to avoid existing habitats and wildlife corridors. \n\nForests. Although the project road traverses the State Forest Reserve Bel-Ulim, \nthis section of the road is not included in the Project. The environmental impact \nwill  only  be  minimal  under  future  projects  because  the  bulk  of  the  work  will  be \nwithin the right-of-way lines. When final design documents are finished, the local \nforestry representative will be able to determine the exact number of trees to be \ncut; this is expected to be a very small number. \n\nThe  contractor's  responsibilities  for  the  essential  elements  of  stabilizing  the \nvegetation and replanting trees, as required, should be spelled out in the contract \nspecifications,  including  (i)  final  grading  and  revegetation  will  be  completed  as \nsoon  as  possible;  (ii)  trenching  will  be  provided  where  necessary,  to  ensure \nsuccessful establishment of vegetation; (iii) seeding with a fast-growing crop and \na  proven  native  seed  mix  will  be  required  immediately  after  fill  placement  to \nprevent  scour  and  encourage  stabilization;  and  (iv)  grazing-resistant  plant \nspecies will be used to revegetate stabilizing slopes. \n\nConclusions \n\n \nH. \n \n20. \nBased on the conclusion the IEE, the proposed rehabilitation of the Osh to Sopu Korgon \nsections of Osh to Irkeshtam road will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts \nprovided  that  the  works  are  designed  and  executed  in  accordance  with  sound  engineering \npractices,  and  that  the  recommended  mitigatory  and  precautionary  measures  are  fully \nimplemented.  Therefore,  no  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  needed  for  this \nProject. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit\nSom1.00\n$1.00\n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 October 2004) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "som (Som) \n$0.024 \nSom42.10 \n", "ADB \nAIDS \nCAR \nEIRR \nGDP \nHIV \nIEE \nLMU \nMEES \nMOH \nMOTC \nNGO \nPIU \nPRC \nSTI \nTA \nVOC \n", "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n", "economic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \ninitial environmental examination \nlocal maintenance unit \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Central Asian republic \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations  \n\u2013  Ministry of Healthcare \n\u2013  Ministry of Transport and Communications \nnongovernment organization \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013  People's Republic of China \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "sexually transmitted infection \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ha \nkm \nm \n", "hectare \nkilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  meter \n", " \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \nNOTES \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  the  Project  Team  comprising  J.
