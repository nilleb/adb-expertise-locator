It connects to the Bishkek-Osh road, a vital national \ntransport  corridor  that  is  being  rehabilitated  under  ongoing  projects \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and to Almaty and \nother  cities  in  Kazakhstan.  The  road  also  connects  to  the  road  to \nDushanbe, a section of which is being rehabilitated under an ongoing \nADB-financed  project,  through  Tajikistan  and  to  Afghanistan. \nThe Project includes improvement of about 124 kilometers (km) of the \nroad (Osh-Gulcha-Sopu Korgon); consulting services for construction \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  and  procurement  of \nmaintenance  equipment  to  maintain  the  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nIrkeshtam road. \n   \nRationale  The Project will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the \nKyrgyz  Republic  by  rehabilitating  a  section  of  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nIrkeshtam  road,  which  will  extend  the  rehabilitated  Bishkek  to  Osh \ncorridor further into the southern region of the Kyrgyz Republic and to \nneighboring countries. The Project will foster regional cooperation by \nrehabilitating a key transport corridor linking the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, \nand Uzbekistan. The project road links the population and production \ncenters of Uzbekistan's part of the Fergana Valley and Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region in the PRC. \n   \nObjectives  The  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce \npoverty by improving the transport network and by increasing regional \ntrade  and  cooperation  through  rehabilitation  of  the  road  linking  the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan. The Project will reduce the cost \nof road transport and improve access to markets for people living along \nthe road. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$43.4  million  equivalent,  of  which  $24.5  million  (56%)  is  foreign \nexchange cost and $18.9 million (44%) equivalent is local currency cost.\n   \n \n ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n    Foreign  Local  Total \n  Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n  ADB  24.5  8.3  32.8 \n  Government  0.0  6.6  6.6 \n  The OPEC Fund   0.0  4.0  4.0 \n    Total  24.5  18.9  43.4 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n         \nLoan Amount and  A loan of SDR 22,272,000 ($32.8 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special \nTerms  Funds resources will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard \nterms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Special  Funds  resources. \nThe loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% during the remaining period.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 March 2009. \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2008. \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established to implement the \nArrangements  Project. The PIU head will be supported by 9 professional and clerical \nstaff  with  expertise  and  experience  in  financial  accounting,  road \nengineering,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  administration. \nThe PIU will be established and made operational prior to the award of \nthe civil works contracts. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \n  accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess of $500,000 for goods and $1.0 million for civil works will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Supply contracts not \nexceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. \nCivil  works  are  packaged  in  three  contracts;  two  will  be  financed \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures and one will be \nfinanced  using  local  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  for  the \nequipment  are  packaged  in  two  contracts  to  be  financed  following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Advance  procurement \naction for civil works was approved on 13 July 2004.  \n   \nConsulting  International consulting services for 57 person-months will be provided \nServices  by a firm for construction supervision, project impact monitoring and \nevaluation,  implementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety, \nauditing, and project management. The international consultants will \nalso provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff and domestic \nconsultants. In association with the international consultants, domestic \nconsulting  services  totaling  500  person-months  will  be  provided  for ", "iv   \nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical \nadvisory  assistance;  as  well  as  for  assisting  the  international \nconsultants in monitoring the social and poverty impact of the Project \nthrough household surveys and data analysis. The consultants to be \nfinanced under the loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nto select the consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project will promote economic growth by increasing regional trade \nand Beneficiaries  and traffic along the project road. The Project will reduce transport costs \nfor residents in the project area and improve access to (i) markets for \nagricultural  goods,  (ii)  employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  social \nservices. The poverty incidence in the project area is 49%, higher than \nthe national level of 41%. The primary economic benefits of the Project \nare vehicle operating cost savings for normal traffic, generated domestic \ntraffic,  reduction  in  road  closing  times  due  to  improved  winter \nmaintenance, benefits from increased agricultural income, and border-\ncrossing fees. The Project will also have other benefits, such as time \nsavings, improved road safety, and improved access to social services, \nwhich have not been quantified. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe Project including only benefits accruing to the Kyrgyz Republic is \n13.3%. The groups receiving the largest shares of the benefits are the \neconomy/Government and freight users, mostly in the private sector. \nDue to the competitive nature of the markets for transport services in \nthe  project  area,  most  of  the  benefits  from  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings  will  be  passed  on  to  transport  users.  The  Project  will  also \ngenerate  benefits  from  international  generated  and  diverted  traffic, \nwhich will accrue to the PRC, Uzbekistan, and other countries in the \nregion. \n   \nRisks and  The Project has been designed to reduce potential risks. To mitigate \nAssumptions  potential  delays  in  implementation,  the  detailed  design  has  been \ncompleted  and  advance  action  has  been  approved.  MOTC  has \nextensive experience with ADB procedures, and procurement activities \nare already under way. Given the high priority that the Government \nassigns to the Project, the Government will make every effort to ensure \nthe timely provision of counterpart funds. The traffic forecast may not \nfully  materialize,  especially  the  international  generated  traffic \ncontributing to the border crossing fees, as obstacles to trade and traffic \nmoving across the border between the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan \nmay  continue  to  be  a  problem.  To  address  this  risk,  the  advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the corridor includes facilitation of regional \ncooperation  and  development  of  a  regional  agency  to  manage  the \noverall transport corridor. Another risk is that project roads may not be \nproperly maintained and thus the full benefits of the Project will not be \nrealized. The project design includes elements to address the risks of \ninadequate financing and implementation of road maintenance for the \nproject roads. The cross-border fees collected on the project road will \nbe used to finance maintenance of the project road and other roads ", "  v\nunder  MOTC  jurisdiction.  The  advisory  TA  will  help  develop  a \nmaintenance strategy, and the Project includes procurement of road \nmaintenance equipment, solely for use on the project road. \n   \nTechnical  The  TA  for  Improving  Road  Maintenance  and  Strengthening  the \nAssistance  Transport Corridor Management Department, for $800,000 equivalent, \nwill  be  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will (i) review and update the corridor \nanalysis, including traffic projections and operation and maintenance \ncosts;  (ii)  help  MOTC  establish  the  corridor  department  institutional \nstructure and the corridor regional executive management agency; and \n(iii) help MOTC develop systems for setting and collecting tolls, financial \nmanagement, maintenance management, procurement of maintenance \nequipment, and traffic facilitation. \n \nThe  TA  for  Awareness  and  Prevention  for  HIV/AIDS,1  Sexually \nTransmitted Infections, and Human Trafficking, for $500,000 equivalent, \nwill  be  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will mitigate potential negative impacts of \nthe Project through education campaigns, training for health workers \nand border guards, workshops and policy development, and monitoring. \nThe TA will focus on construction workers, sex workers, road users, \nhealth workers, officials, and border guards in the project area. \n \n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Southern Transport Corridor Road Rehabilitation Project; and (ii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to be provided by the \nOPEC Fund for International Development for the Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for (i) Improving Road Maintenance and Strengthening the Transport \nCorridor Management Department, and (ii) Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS,1 Sexually \nTransmitted Infections (STIs), and Human Trafficking, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The Project will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic by \nrehabilitating a section of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road, which will extend the rehabilitated \nlink from Bishkek to Osh further into the southern Kyrgyz Republic, and also to neighboring \ncountries. The Project will foster regional cooperation by rehabilitating the key transport corridor \nlinking the Kyrgyz Republic, People's Republic of China (PRC), and Uzbekistan. The Government \nconsiders improvement of the project road (Osh-Gulcha-Sopu Korgon road) as one of its highest \npriorities and an important part of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Government \nrecognizes that improving transport links is essential to increase trade and economic growth, and \nhas officially declared the Project a national priority.2 The feasibility study was conducted as part \nof ADB\u2019s regional TA on cooperation in transport in the Central Asian republics (CARs).3 The \nframework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country, with road transport dominating \nthe  country's  transport  system.  Road  transport  accounted  for  about  94%  of  freight  tonnage \nmovements  and  almost  all  passenger  traffic  (excluding  intraurban)  in  2001.  About  18,900 \nkilometers  (km)  of  roads  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC): 9,900 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads. About 40% of the \nroads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50% are gravel and \nless than 10% are earth roads. About 15,000 km of roads are outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly \nrural and farm roads. The coverage of the road network is generally adequate for the development \nneeds of the country. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion or major upgrading of \nthe transport system, but proper maintenance and rehabilitation to preserve the existing network, \nwhich suffers from widespread deterioration. \n \n4.  As with most other republics of the former Soviet Union, the economic crisis stemming \nfrom the breakup resulted in a decline in economic activity and disrupted customary trading \npatterns. The demand for transport has fallen dramatically since independence. In 2001, freight \nturnover (measured in ton-km) was only 20% of its 1990 level, and passenger turnover was 57% \nof its previous level. The lowest levels were reached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton-\nkm and passenger movements were only 14% and 33% of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting \na sharp decline in real incomes and output. Demand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight transport \ndecreased again following the 1998 financial crisis in the Russian Federation. Growth of freight \n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  Law of the Kyrgyz Republic No. 72 On Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam Road Rehabilitation Project Priorities. 12 April 2003. \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Regional Cooperation in Transport Projects in Central Asia. Manila. \n ", " 2 \ntransport resumed in 1999. Passenger transport has been growing at about 6% annually since \n1997.  \n \n5.  The Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administering \nroad  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC,  which  is  responsible  for  policymaking  and \nregulating,  planning,  and  developing  transport  and  communications  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nincluding road, railway, and aviation. The Department of Roads under MOTC is responsible for \nmanaging the road sector. MOTC's seven regional road maintenance agencies, one in each \nprovince, plus the Bishkek-Osh Road Division are responsible for maintaining the state and local \nroads under MOTC's jurisdiction. The regional road maintenance agencies and Bishkek-Osh \nRoad Division comprise 58 local maintenance units that carry out actual maintenance works. \n \n6.  Until 1994, transport companies were controlled by a joint stockholding company, Kyrgyz \nAuto Transport, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions to \nMOTC. Of the total 251 transport enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been privatized, \nprimarily through conversion to joint-stock companies. Of the 86 companies currently providing \nroad transport services, 74 have been privatized. Those that have not been privatized comprise \nurban bus enterprises in major cities and some enterprises connected with state security. As a \nresult of measures introduced by the Government in 1994 to increase competition, most of the \nnational and provincial holding companies and associations (which had continued to exercise \ncontrol over the operations of individual transport companies) were abolished. Through regulation \nthe  Government  continues  to  have  a  strong  influence  in  the  market  for  intercity  passenger \ntransport. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created in MOTC in 1994, issues transport licenses and \nregulates transport services. The market for freight transport services is more competitive than \nthat for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions of price \nand quality of service directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate \nand arrange intermodal transport services, thus facilitating door-to-door transport arrangements, \nand to offer services directly themselves. However, the Government also plays a large role in \nfreight transport, through regulation. MOTC is responsible for monitoring and regulation, including \nlicensing, inspection, and safety audits. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries of the former Soviet Union, with per \ncapita gross domestic product (GDP) of $377 in 2003. About 41% of the population was estimated \nto be living in poverty in 2003 with about 9% living in nutrition-based extreme poverty.4 The \npoverty level has declined from its peak in 1999, following the Russian financial crisis, of an \nestimated 55.3% (on a per capita expenditure basis). The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy  is  in  Appendix  3,  and  summary  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The emergence of high levels of poverty in the country can be traced \nto the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in production due \nto the disruption of geographically spread production chains and loss of traditional markets. GDP \ndeclined by almost 50% during 1991\u20131995. Economic growth resumed in 1996, although it has \nbeen uneven, due to events such as the Russian financial crisis of 1998. Among the factors \nresponsible for the continuing high levels of poverty is the difficulty of developing external and \ndomestic markets for Kyrgyz products, reflecting the landlocked nature of country with its trade \nand transit problems, limited natural resources, and the small size of the domestic market. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n ", "  3\n8.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  future  development  is  dependent  on  enhancing  its  access  to \nregional  markets  and  diversifying  its  exports.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \nemphasizes the importance of promoting regional cooperation and improving transport links to \nincrease exports. Regional dimensions and facilitation of trade are therefore important aspects of \ntransport development. The long distances to ocean ports and large markets give even greater \nimportance  to  developing  an  efficient  transport  system,  including  links  to  other  countries. \nPromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  is  also  a  key  component  of  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive Development Framework to 2010. Regional cooperation is essential to achieving \nthis given the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s small population and landlocked location. The Project will greatly \nfacilitate increased regional trade and cooperation. The Government recognizes the Project\u2019s \nimportance and has officially declared it as a national priority. \n \n9.  Financing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate \nfor  the  country\u2019s  needs.  With  the  assistance  of  an  ADB-financed  TA  for  institutional \nstrengthening,5 the Government passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and, as specified in the loan \ncovenants for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project,6 is collecting road user charges prescribed \nunder the act. According to the act, a portion of road revenues should be deposited into a \nseparate road fund account. In view of the severe fiscal problems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic in \n2001,  and  as  advised  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (to  meet  its  requirement  for  a \nconsolidated budget), ADB waived a loan covenant requiring the establishment of a separate \ndedicated road fund account, although the collection of road user charges in accordance with the \nRoad Fund Act is continuing. At present, the Ministry of Finance makes annual allocations for \nroad maintenance and other road sector expenditures based on overall budget considerations. \nThe allocations have been inadequate to meet the sector\u2019s needs. Total Government road-sector \nexpenditures ranged from $5.8 to $11.4 million during 2000\u20132003, peaking in 2002. Planned \nGovernment  expenditures  for  2004  and  2005  are  $13.0  and  $9.6  million,  respectively. \nExpenditures on road maintenance accounted for at least half of the Government\u2019s road sector \nexpenditures during 2000\u20132003, except in 2002. These expenditures increased from about $2.9 \nto $5.4 million during 2000\u20132003, with about $6.5 and $5.3 million per year planned for 2004 and \n2005, respectively. The Project will address the issue of financing for road maintenance through \nuse of border-crossing fees to finance maintenance, development of a new strategy for financing \nroad maintenance, and loan covenants to ensure adequate financing for maintenance. \n \n10.  The Government's transport strategy and plans are included in the Transport and Road \nSector Policy Statement prepared with assistance of ADB TA (footnote 5). The Government's \noverall policy objectives for transport include (i) adequately maintaining transport infrastructure \nto  support  the  reform  of  the  economy;  (ii)  privatizing  transport  operations  and  promoting \ncompetition among operators, while addressing safety and environmental concerns; and (iii) \nincreasing cost recovery from transport infrastructure users. To achieve these objectives, the \nGovernment's  strategy  includes  (i)  increasing  the  financial  provision  for  rehabilitating  and \nmaintaining the road network, (ii) consolidating road sector responsibilities under MOTC, and \n(iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance.  The  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment in implementing its strategy for the road sector, and addressing the problems and \nopportunities related to poverty reduction and road maintenance.  \n \n11.  The Project will contribute to the achievement of the overall objective of ADB\u2019s Country \nStrategy and Program for the Kyrgyz Republic of reducing poverty by promoting private-sector-led \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

Promoting regional cooperation, with an \nemphasis on trade and transport infrastructure, is one of the means by which ADB aims to \npromote private-sector-led economic growth. The Project, which is included in ADB\u2019s assistance \nprogram for 2004, shares this objective.  \n \n12.  ADB is the major provider of assistance ($145 million) to the road sector (Appendix 4). \nADB has been intensively involved in rehabilitating key sections of the country\u2019s road network. \nThe  three  completed  and  ongoing  projects  to  rehabilitate  most  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road, \nimplemented in cooperation with other development agencies, have greatly improved transport \nbetween the southern and northern regions of the country. In addition, the ongoing ADB-financed \nproject to rehabilitate the road from Bishkek to Almaty improves international links for the northern \nand southern regions to Kazakhstan, which has road links to other major countries of the region. \nThe Project will expand the reach of this improved road corridor, by extending it from Osh toward \nthe border with the PRC. The World Bank approved a $22 million loan for the Urban Transport \nProject in 2000 to rehabilitate urban roads in Bishkek, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, and Islamic Development Bank have worked together to rehabilitate the \nBishkek-Osh road. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation provided parallel cofinancing of \n$28  million  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  maintenance  equipment  for  the  road \nrehabilitation project,7 and provided parallel cofinancing of $40.8 million for the Second Road \nRehabilitation  Project  (footnote  6).  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  approved  two  loans  to \nrehabilitate the Jalal-Abad-Uzgen section of the Bishkek-Osh road and a section of the Suusamur-\nTorugart road. \n \n13.  Lessons Learned. The project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and \nTA operations in general, ADB\u2019s road sector operations in the Kyrgyz Republic, and other projects \nand TAs in the CARs. One of the lessons from ADB\u2019s impact evaluation study on roads and \npoverty reduction8 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened by neglecting \nroad maintenance. The Project is addressing this by requiring specified levels of financing for road \nmaintenance (for the the project road as well as other roads) and purchasing maintenance \nequipment to be used on the entire corridor including the project road. In addition, the advisory TA \nassociated with the Project will help the Government develop a new road maintenance strategy \nand establish the management department for the project road, which will be responsible for road \nmaintenance. The impact evaluation study also concluded that improved roads are a necessary \nbut  not  sufficient  condition  for  reducing  poverty.  The  Project  is  addressing  this  point  by \ncomplementing  numerous  income-generation  and  other  poverty-reduction  projects  being \nimplemented in the project area by ADB and other international agencies (para. 53). \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s TA Performance Audit Report on Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to \nthe Road Sector in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia9 found that the scope of TAs \nshould be achievable within the given time frame. The report also found that expenditures on road \nmaintenance in the three CARs need to be increased. These recommendations have been \naddressed in the project design by (i) providing a 12-month and 37-month implementation periods \nfor the advisory TAs on the corridor department and HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking, \nrespectively, and (ii) loan covenants and development of a new strategy for road maintenance.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1996.

Implementation  of  ADB-financed  road  sector  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has \nproceeded satisfactorily; the sector has been one of the best performing. Two of the three ongoing \nroad projects have satisfactory project ratings, and one (the Almaty-Bishkek Road Rehabilitation \nProject10) is rated partly satisfactory. The project completion report for the Road Rehabilitation \nProject (footnote 7) rated the project as successful. The main issue regarding implementation \nperformance is delay in implementation. The Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) and \nthe Almaty-Bishkek Road Rehabilitation Project have experienced delays in implementation due \nto delays in procurement, changes in scope of work (including slope rehabilitation), and time taken \nfor ratification of a cross-border agreement between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The \nproposed Project is not expected to encounter such delays as (i) the detailed design pays close \nattention  to  issues  of  slope  rehabilitation,  and  (ii)  MOTC  now  has  significant  experience  in \nprocuring road maintenance equipment. The Project has been designed in close coordination \nwith the Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the Government \nhas the financial capability to comply with covenants affecting the budget. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n16.  The objective of the Project is to promote economic growth and reduce poverty by \nimproving the transport network in the Kyrgyz Republic, and by increasing regional trade and \ncooperation by rehabilitating sections of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road, which links the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan. The Project will reduce the cost of road transport and \nimprove access to markets for people living along the road. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n17.  The scope of the Project includes (i) improving about 124 km of the two-lane highway from \nOsh to Gulcha to Sopu Korgon, (ii) providing consulting services for construction supervision and \nmonitoring and evaluation, (iii) procuring maintenance equipment to maintain the entire Osh-Sary \nTash-Irkeshtam road, and (iv) providing two advisory TAs for (a) improving road maintenance and \nstrengthening the transport corridor management department; and (b) awareness and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking. \n \n18.  The project road is mostly a two-lane national highway, with the exception of some four-\nlane sections near Osh. The condition of the road varies widely depending on past maintenance \nactivity and geological conditions. On the first 22 km (near Osh) the road passes through a more \nor less contiguous flat plain; while on the 24\u201330 km section, the road passes through the Taldyk \nRiver floodplain and is subject to bank erosion during the river\u2019s heavier flows. The next section of \nthe road traverses the steep terrain of the Chygyrchyk Pass, on which the alignment rises from an \naltitude of 2,100 meters (m) at km 56 to 2,400 m at km 61, and then drops to 1,550 m at km 80. \nThe section from km 80 to km 124 of the project road passes along the river, on the embankment \nin the floodplain, and on the lower slopes of adjoining mountains. The road is vulnerable to \nerosion and landslides at many points, and the bituminous pavement has been completely lost \nover several short sections. \n \n19.  The Government requested that the Project improve the Osh to Sopu Korgon section (the \nmost populated part of the road), as its improvement will provide the greatest benefits to the local \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2000.

Manila. ", " 6 \npopulation,  while  also  improving  the  regional  corridor.  At  the  same  time,  the  PRC-financed \nimprovement works (para. 24) will separately focus on the unpaved section from the PRC-Kyrgyz \nRepublic  border  westward.  The  Project\u2019s  rehabilitation  works,  which  will  vary  according  to \nlocation,  include  surface  overlay,  reinforcement  of  embankment,  slope  rehabilitation  and \nprotection measures, installation of drainage systems, safety facilities, and measures to prevent \nmajor rock falls. In addition, seriously deteriorated bridges will be replaced. All the project works \nhave been designed to comply with the highway design standards developed under ADB\u2019s TA on \nroad design standards in the CARs.11 In addition, the road maintenance equipment to be procured \nunder the Project will become the property of MOTC and will be used on the entire Osh-Sary \nTash-Irkeshtam road.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Regional Cooperation \n \n20.  The Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road comprises part of the larger Tashkent-Osh-Kashgar \ntransport corridor that links the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan with Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion (Xinjiang) in the PRC, crossing through Osh and other points in the southern Kyrgyz \nRepublic. Tashkent is about 410 km from Osh; the distance from Osh to Irkeshtam (at the PRC \nborder) is about 260 km; and Kashgar is 240 km east of Irkeshtam. Both the Fergana Valley in \nUzbekistan and Xinjiang in the PRC are important and dynamic population and commercial \ncenters  in  Central  Asia.  The  Fergana  Valley  comprises  approximately  30%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \npopulation and value of retail trade, and is a center of agricultural production. Xinjiang Region is \ndynamic, with average GDP growth of 9.0% during 2001\u20132003, higher than the national rate in \nthe PRC, and population exceeding 19 million.  \n \n21.  Trade between the PRC and the Kyrgyz Republic has been growing rapidly, and the PRC \nis now the third largest importer of goods from the Kyrgyz Republic. Xinjiang\u2019s imports from the \nKyrygz Republic increased by 26% during 2002-2003, while total trade between them increased \nby 50%. The potential for continued rapid increases in trade is substantial; both countries have \njoined the World Trade Organization. Improving the transport link between the Fergana Valley and \nXinjiang will greatly facilitate the growth in trade and economic development in the region. There \ncurrently is regional traffic on the project road, even in its deteriorated state. Commodities shipped \non the project road include scrap metal and coal, which are imported by the PRC, and account for \nabout 69% and 21% of the bilateral trade on the corridor. Trade in other commodities, such as \nexports of leather hides and wool from the Kyrgyz Republic and exports of consumer goods from \nthe PRC, account for about 10% of cross-border trade. With an improved road, opportunities will \nincrease for the shipping of agricultural produce from the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan to \nXinjiang.  ADB  is  also  facilitating  regional  trade  through  the  proposed  Regional  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project (included in ADB\u2019s program for 2004), \nunder which communications equipment will be provided for the Kyrgyz Republic border post at \nIrkeshtam on the transport corridor. \n \n22.  The Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road has broader regional significance as well. In addition \nto linking these important commercial centers in the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan, the \nroad also provides connections to Afghanistan and Tajikistan to the south and to Almaty, other \ncities in Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation to the north. At Sary Tash (184 km from Osh), \nthere is a junction with the road leading to the border with Tajikistan and onward to the capital \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for a Review of Road Design and Construction Standards. Manila. \n ", "  7\nDushanbe (a section of this road is being rehabilitated under an ADB loan12), and eventually to the \nAfghanistan-Tajikistan border. At Osh, the project road connects to the Bishkek-Osh road, for \nwhich ADB has financed three road rehabilitation projects, and to the Bishkek-Almaty road, also \nbeing rehabilitated through an ADB-financed loan. In addition to its key importance for Central \nAsia, the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road has even broader geographic significance. By providing \nan intermodal link between the railway networks of the PRC and Uzbekistan, which terminate in \nKashgar and Osh respectively, rehabilitation of the project road will enable the formation of a \ncomprehensive intermodal transportation network extending from Western Europe to the coastal \nregions of the PRC. \n \n23.  Preparatory work for development of the corridor has been under way for several years. In \n1998, the Agreement on International Road Transportation between the governments of the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan, was negotiated. ADB has been actively involved in trying \nto improve cooperation among these countries. Through the ADB-financed regional TA (footnote \n3), regional working group meetings were held in November 2002 and February 2003 to facilitate \nregional transport and trade along the project road and implementation of the Project. Following \nthese meetings, the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC formed the Joint Expert \nGroup, with the objective of facilitating the improvement of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road \ncorridor. The first Joint Expert Group meeting was held in Bishkek in March 2004. While there is \nintense cooperation between the governments of the PRC and Kyrgyz Republic on improving the \nproject road and facilitating transport and trade, cross-border transport and trade across the \nKyrgyz Republic-Uzbekistan border encounter some difficulties. ADB is continuing to address \nthese difficulties through dialogue by missions and the resident missions in the region, and TA, \nincluding ongoing TA and the attached advisory TA for the road corridor (paras. 39\u201340).  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s programs to rehabilitate the transport corridor and foster regional cooperation have \nmobilized resources beyond those directly involved in the Project. The PRC provided the Kyrgyz \nGovernment with two grants totaling 60 million yuan (about $7.2 million) for rehabilitation of a 19 \nkm section of the road, from Irkeshtam at the Kyrgyz-PRC border westward to Sary Tash. The \ncivil works financed by these grants commenced in June 2004. Also, the Islamic Development \nBank's  program  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  2005\u20132007  includes  two  loans,  of  $10  million \nequivalent each, for rehabilitating other sections of the road. ADB\u2019s proposed program for the \nKyrgyz Republic for 2005\u20132007 includes a standby loan in 2006 to rehabilitate the remaining \nsection of the road. All sections of the road will be improved based on the same design and to the \nsame technical standards, including maximum vehicle weights. In addition, both the PRC and \nUzbek governments have already rehabilitated or are now improving the sections of the corridor in \ntheir territories. The portion of the corridor in Uzbekistan (comprising 408 km from Tashkent to \nOsh) is in good condition and is classified as category I (four-lane, divided carriageway) and \ncategory II (two-lane, single carriageway). Plans are under way to upgrade some of the category II \nsections, and two tunnels were recently completed. The PRC portion of the corridor consists of \n240 km from Irkeshtam to Kashgar, and is well maintained and in good condition. Most of the road \nis category III (bitumen surface), although some sections are being upgraded to category II. \n \n2.  Policy Dialogue and Road Maintenance Financing \n \n25.  ADB has been addressing the inadequate financing for road maintenance in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic through policy dialogue and TA. ADB\u2019s initial strategy was to assist the Government in \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Asisstance Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project \n(Phase l). Manila ", " 8 \nestablishing a road fund to finance road maintenance and other sector expenditures. Through \npolicy dialogue under the first ADB-financed road project (footnote 7) and with the assistance of \nan ADB-financed TA for institutional strengthening (footnote 5), the Government passed the Road \nFund Act in 1998. The policy dialogue under the second ADB-financed road project (footnote 6) \nfocused on making the road fund operational, e.g., establishing the revenue sources for the fund \nand maintaining the separate road fund account. Following the termination of separate budget \naccounts and consolidation of the national budget as a result of the country\u2019s severe fiscal \nproblems (para. 9), ADB modified its strategy to focus on providing maintenance funds through \nthe Government\u2019s standard budget procedures. The strategy emphasized the need to ensure that \n(i) sufficient financing was provided for the roads rehabilitated under projects financed by ADB \nand  cofinanciers,  thus  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  Government\u2019s  investment;  and  (ii) \nincreased levels of financing are provided for maintaining all other roads under MOTC jurisdiction, \nto the extent possible, given the country\u2019s fiscal constraints.  \n \n26.  To implement ADB's revised strategy, the Third Road Rehabilitation Project13 included a \nloan covenant concerning financing of road maintenance with the following two components: (i) \nfinancing of maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh road, and (ii) financing of maintenance of all other \nroads under MOTC jurisdiction. The Government has substantially complied with the covenant, \ndespite facing overall fiscal constraints as well as demands to repair infrastructure damaged by \nnatural disasters. The Government\u2019s actual expenditures for maintaining the Bishkek-Osh road in \n2002, 2003, and 2004 exceeded the levels required by the loan covenant.14 The Government\u2019s \ncompliance with the first component of the covenant demonstrates that ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has \nbeen effective in ensuring that sufficient financing is provided to ensure the sustainability of the \nGovernment\u2019s investment in rehabilitating key roads. While the expenditures for maintenance of \nall other roads under MOTC jurisdiction for 2002\u20132004 fell short of the required amount, the \nshortfalls in 2002 and 2003 were only 11% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, the combined \namounts for the Bishkek-Osh road as well as other MOTC roads are virtually in compliance with \nthe required levels for 2002\u20132003, and the total amount for 2004 is 25% higher than in 2002.  \n \n27.  Although  the  Government  has  substantially  complied  with  the  maintenance-financing \ncovenant, it is likely to continue to face fiscal constraints. As a result, the Government and ADB \nhave  agreed  on  an  action  plan  for  developing  and  implementing  a  new  strategy  to  ensure \nadequate road maintenance (included in Appendix 2). The strategy will consist of the following \ncomponents: developing new approaches to provide and allocate funding for road maintenance; \nusing cross-border fees generated by the Project to finance maintenance of the project road and \nother  MOTC  roads;  and  continuing  compliance  with  the  maintenance-financing  covenant  for \nrecently rehabilitated roads. The advisory TA for Improving Road Maintenance and Strengthening \nthe Transport Corridor Management Department (paras. 39\u201340) will develop a new system of \nprioritization of the road network, estimate maintenance costs for the road categories, develop a \nmethodology  for  allocating  maintenance  expenditures,  and  develop  alternative  means  for \nmaintenance  that  do  not  rely  substantially  on  the  national  budget,  e.g.,  community-based \nmaintenance. The Government has agreed that the revenue from border-crossing fees exceeding \nthe costs of operating and maintaining the transport corridor will be made available to MOTC to \nfinance the maintenance of other MOTC roads (para. 48). MOTC has demonstrated its support for \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001.

Financing Plan \n \n29.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent to $32.8 million in \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The \nproposed loan will finance $24.5 million (100%) of the foreign exchange cost and $8.3 million \nequivalent (43.9%) of the total currency cost, or 75.6% of the total project cost. The proposed \nADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nGovernment will provide counterpart financing of $6.6 million to primarily cover taxes related to \nthe civil works. Loan proceeds will not be used to finance taxes. The financing plan includes $4 \nmillion in cofinancing, which the Government has requested from the OPEC Fund to finance civil \nworks. The project loan is included in Government\u2019s Public Investment Program.

MOTC,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  to \nimplement  the  Project.  The  PIU  will  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project \nimplementation, (ii) prepare withdrawal applications, (iii) prepare project progress reports, and \n(iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for auditing the Project. The \nhead of the PIU, who must be acceptable to ADB and have adequate experience in project \nmanagement, will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of implementation activities. \nThe PIU head will be supported by nine professional and clerical staff with expertise and \nexperience in financial accounting, road engineering, construction supervision, and contract \nadministration. The PIU will be established and made operational prior to the award of the civil \nworks  contracts.  The  PIU  for  the  Third  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  13)  will  be \nresponsible for advance procurement action activities. ADB has been working closely with \nMOTC for several years on implementation of other road rehabilitation projects. ADB believes \nthat  MOTC  has,  and  the  PIU  will  have,  with  necessary  consultant  support,  the  financial \nmanagement capacity to manage the Project effectively. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n31.  The Project will be implemented in 3.3 years (40 months) from June 2005 to September \n2008, including mobilization but excluding the defects liability period (the period during which the \ncontractor is responsible for maintenance). The civil works for the project road are scheduled to \nbegin  in  September  2005  (including  mobilization)  and  be  completed  by  August  2008.  The \nproposed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n32.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $1.0 \nmillion for civil works will be procured through international competitive bidding among prequalified \nbidders. Supply contracts for the equipment have been packaged into two contracts, which will be \nfinanced  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Any  supply  contracts  not \nexceeding $500,000  will be procured through international shopping.  Civil  works  have been \npackaged into three contracts\u2014two will be financed following international competitive bidding \nprocedures. One contract, for $500,000, for civil works to improve road safety on the Taldyk Pass \nand construct a roadside station (road service area) at Sopu Korgon, will be financed following \nlocal competitive bidding procedures. Tentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n33.  International consulting services for 57 person-months will be provided by a firm, for \nconstruction supervision, project impact monitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures \nto improve road safety, auditing, and project management. The international consultants will also \nprovide on-the-job training for the counterpart staff and domestic consultants. In association with \nthe international consultants, 500 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nfor construction supervision, contract management, and other technical advisory assistance; as \nwell as for helping the international consultants monitor the social and poverty impact of the \nProject through household surveys and data analysis. Draft terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix B. Sufficient domestic consulting services are available \n ", " 11\nin  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A full technical proposal will be \nrequired for the consulting services, and the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nin selecting the consultants. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n34.  All disbursements under the loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). The disbursement procedures will include (i) a direct payment \nprocedure, (ii) a commitment procedure, or (iii) a reimbursement procedure. In view of the high \npriority the Government accords the Project and to minimize implementation delays and ensure \nthe  timely  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  requested  ADB  approval  for  advance \nprocurement action for civil works packages. The advance actions, up to but not including signing \nof contracts, will cover prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for the civil \nworks contract packages to help implement the Project. Advance action was approved at the \nManagement Review Meeting on 13 July 2004. The Government has been advised that ADB's \napproval of the advance action does not commit ADB to approve the Project or finance any \nrecruitment and procurement costs. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n35.  MOTC will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on project \nimplementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. MOTC will maintain \nseparate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and the Government, and have \nthem  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate  knowledge  and  experience  of \ninternational accounting practices and is acceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts and the \nauditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. The \nGovernment has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the  suspension  of  disbursements  in  case  of \nnoncompliance. To facilitate evaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to provide a \nproject completion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n36.  ADB  and  MOTC  will  agree  upon  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating project performance in relation to its goals and purposes, with an emphasis on poverty \nreduction, prior to project commencement. Representative indicators are included in the project \nframework. At the beginning of project implementation, MOTC will confirm baseline values for \nsocial,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  indicators.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be \nmeasured, with the necessary frequency, during project implementation. Comments and findings \nregarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In \naddition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be \nmeasured  at  project  completion  and  1  year  and  3  years  after  completion.  Where  relevant, \nindicators will be disaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place, and results will \nbe compared with the baseline. A final report will consist of an evaluation of changes that \noccurred in the preceding 3 years. MOTC has developed its monitoring capability for the ongoing \nprojects, and has the capacity to monitor the Project as well. To facilitate assessment of the \nsocioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  an  international  consultant  will  be \nrecruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n ", " 12 \n37.  ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review of project implementation in \n2006.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, and social aspects and poverty reduction. \nThe Project\u2019s economic viability and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on project \nperformance will also be assessed. The review will examine the implementation progress for the \npolicy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the officials of the Government during project \nprocessing.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption-free \nenvironment, and has agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in \npreparing all documents and contracts during the bidding process and project implementation. \n \nIV.

The Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory and operational TA to assist \nin  establishing  and  operating  the  management  department  of  the  Osh-SaryTash-Irkeshtam \ntransport  corridor.  The  TA  will  help  MOTC  improve  road  maintenance;  update  the  corridor \nanalysis, including traffic projections and operation and maintenance costs; establish and make \noperational the corridor department institutional structure and the corridor regional executive \nmanagement agency; and establish and make operational systems for setting and collecting tolls, \nfinancial management, maintenance management, procurement of maintenance equipment, and \ntraffic facilitation. The TA will require about 20 person-months of international and 105 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services, with expertise in management of transport institutions, \nfinancial analysis, and road maintenance. Outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 8.  \n  \n40.  The total TA cost is estimated to be $950,000 equivalent comprising foreign exchange \ncost  of  $509,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $441,000  equivalent.  A  TA  grant  of  $800,000 \nequivalent is proposed for ADB financing to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $509,000 \nand $291,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining local cost of \n$150,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government. \u041c\u041e\u0422C, the Executing Agency for the \nTA,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  activities,  including  liaison  and \ncoordination  with  other  concerned  Government  departments  or  agencies.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented in 12 months beginning in March 2006. The TA is expected to be completed by \nFebruary 2007. A simplified technical proposal will be required for the consulting services, and the \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod in accordance with \u0410D\u0412\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nB.  Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and \nHuman Trafficking \n \n41.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  an  advisory  TA  for  awareness  and \nprevention of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking on the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam transport \ncorridor. The goal of the TA is to mitigate the risks of increases in HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human \ntrafficking that may arise during road rehabilitation. The TA\u2019s purpose is to raise public awareness \nand  address  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs,  transmission  and  human  trafficking  among \nconstruction workers, sex workers, local communities, truck drivers, border officers, and other \nroad users. The TA will require about 11 person-months of international and 72 person-months of \n ", " 13\ndomestic consulting services, with expertise in health education and advocacy, HIV/AIDS medical \nservices,  epidemiological  surveillance,  prevention  of  human  trafficking,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. A simplified technical proposal will be required for the consulting services, and the \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod  in  accordance  with  \u0410D\u0412\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the TA consultants are provided in Appendix 9. \n \n42.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $325,500 in \nforeign exchange cost and $274,500 equivalent in local currency cost. A grant of $500,000 \nequivalent, to be financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, is \nproposed to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $174,500 equivalent of local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  by  providing  in-kind \ncontributions  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  workshop  facilities.  The  Ministry  of \nHealthcare will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing the TA in coordination \nwith MOTC and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Combat Against Illegal Trafficking in Humans. TA \nimplementation  will  commence  in  the  second  half  of  2005,  or  3  months  before  the \ncommencement of the civil works under the Project, and be completed 3 years later in 2008. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n \n43.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type and type of traffic (normal, diverted, and generated) \nwere  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2005\u20132027.  The  forecasts  are  based  on \nexpected growth in GDP, on income elasticities of demand for freight and passenger vehicles, \nand on expected future trade patterns. GDP is estimated to grow at 4.5%. per annum. Income \nelasticities  of  demand  of  1.4,  1.2,  and  1.0  are  for  cars,  buses,  and  trucks,  respectively, \ncomprising  normal  traffic.  Elasticities  of  1.3  and  1.1  are  applied  to  passenger  and  freight \nvehicles, respectively, for the remainder of the project period. Based on forecast GDP growth, \nincome  elasticities  of  demand,  and  expected  trade  patterns  over  the  total  project  period, \naverage annual traffic growth rates for buses, cars, and trucks are estimated at 6.3%, 5.4%, and \n4.5% during 2005\u20132015, and 3.0% for all vehicles during the remainder of the project period. \nThe traffic forecast is in Appendix 10. Normal traffic is expected to account for 65%\u201370% of total \ntraffic on the project road sections in 2027. Trucks are forecast to comprise the majority of traffic \non the road following implementation. \n \n2.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Distribution Analysis \n \n44.  The economic analysis was carried out for the project road on the basis of a comparison \nof the with- and without-project scenarios (Appendix 11). In the without-project scenario, the \nroad is assumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-\nproject scenario assumes that, following project completion, routine and periodic maintenance \nwill follow international standards. During the project preparatory work (footnote 3), various \ndesign alternatives were considered; the project design is based on the least-cost option. \n \n45.  Project economic costs include the resource costs of road improvement and maintenance, \nmaintenance equipment, and consulting services. Economic benefits were calculated using the \nsame methodology used for costs. The primary economic benefits for the Project arise from (i) \nvehicle operating cost savings for normal traffic, (ii) generated domestic traffic, (iii) reduction of ", " 14 \nroad closing times due to improved winter maintenance, (iv) increased agricultural income, and (v) \ncollection of border-crossing fees. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced from the \nreduction  of  transport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  The  Project  includes  procurement  of \nmaintenance equipment for the entire road from Osh to Irkeshtam, and the associated TA will help \nmanage maintenance and other operations on the road. Improved maintenance will result in a \nsignificant reduction in road closures during winter. Upon completion of the Project, border-\ncrossing fees will be charged, and will replace the fees charged for permits under the current \nsystem. The fees paid by non-Kyrgyz road users represent benefits to the Kyrgyz Republic. \nBenefits from increased agricultural income arise from the higher prices that farmers will be able \nto  obtain  for  their  produce  (primarily  vegetables  and  livestock)  through  improved  access  to \nmarkets. The Project will also have other benefits, such as time savings, improved road safety, \nand improved access to social services; these have not been quantified. \n  \n46.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project,  including  only  benefits \naccruing to the Kyrgyz Republic, is 13.3% and the net present value is $3.0 million using a 12% \ndiscount rate. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat capital costs would have to increase by 13% or total benefits decrease by 11% for the EIRR \nto reach the cutoff level of 12%. The risks of the EIRR declining below 12% are mitigated by the \nuncomplicated nature of the rehabilitation works, ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in the \nKyrgyz Republic and other CARs, and the conservative assumptions used in the analysis. The \nProject will also result in benefits to other countries from international generated and diverted \ntraffic, which are not included in the EIRR calculation as they do not accrue to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new  traffic  arising  from  increased  trade \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Uzbekistan resulting from improvement of the project \nroad, and also to and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Diverted traffic comprises traffic diverted \nfrom two existing routes: Uzbekistan-Russian Federation and Uzbekistan-PRC. Traffic will be \ndiverted as the road will enable a switch to markets in the PRC in the first case and to the shorter \nproject route in the second case. The present value of the benefits from international generated \nand diverted traffic is estimated at $123 million. \n \n47.  Distribution analysis was carried out to determine the Project\u2019s primary beneficiaries. The \nproject benefits are distributed among five national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users \nof passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) laborers, and (v) the Government/economy of the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  groups  receiving  the  largest  shares  of  the  benefits  are  the \nGovernment/economy and freight users, predominantly private sector. The large share accruing \nto the Government/economy arises from the benefits from the border-crossing fees. The large \nshare accruing to freight users is  due  to  the  large share of  vehicle  operating cost savings \naccounted for by trucks and the competitive nature of the Kyrgyz trucking industry, which makes it \nlikely that the vehicle operating cost savings will be passed on to users through reduced fares. \n \nB.  Financial Benefits \n \n48.  A system for collection of border-crossing fees will be implemented following completion of \nthe  Project,  and  will  replace  the  fees  charged  for  permits  under  the  current  system.  The \nGovernment has agreed that the fees will be set at a minimum of Som850 per vehicle crossing \n(about $20). The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. The Government agreed that \nrevenue from the fees will be used to finance operation and maintenance of the Osh-Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam transport corridor; any excess revenue will be used to finance maintenance of other \nroads under MOTC jurisdiction (para. 62). Estimates of revenues from the border-crossing fees \nand corridor maintenance and operating costs are shown in Appendix 11. The estimates indicate \n ", " 15\nthat the fees will cover the corridor costs and generate a substantial surplus ranging from $1.6 \nmillion to $6.0 million per year, which will be used for maintenance of other roads. \n \nC.  Impact on Poverty \n \n49.  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the project area and the country by \nfacilitating economic growth through increased regional trade and by reducing transport costs. \nThe poverty incidence in the project area is 49%, higher than the national level of 41%. The \nProject is expected to benefit about 67,000 people, including about 38,000 poor. The primary \neconomic activity in the project area is agriculture, with the raising of livestock becoming more \ndominant the greater the distance from Osh. According to surveys during project preparation, the \nmain causes of poverty are unemployment and the low prices received for agricultural produce. \nThe Project will address both of these causes of poverty by facilitating trade; facilitating transport \nof local agricultural produce to markets; improving access to social services; creating jobs for \nproject  implementation;  reducing  transport  costs;  providing  income  generation  opportunities \nthrough construction of a roadside station; and maximizing the poverty-reduction benefits from \nother projects being implemented in the project area. \n \n50.  The Project will primarily reduce poverty by facilitating regional traffic and trade and thus \nincreased exports and job creation, and reducing transport costs for residents of the project area. \nBy providing improved access to Xinjiang with its large market, as well as to Afghanistan and \nTajikistan, the Project will lead to increased exports of Kyrgyz goods and therefore job creation in \nthe project area, especially in Osh, thus helping to reduce the high levels of unemployment. The \nincreased levels of traffic on the project road will also result in job creation by stimulating the \nroadside service industry, e.g., provision of food for drivers and vehicle-repair services, thus \nproviding employment for local residents. The improvement of the  project road will improve \naccess to the city of Osh and other locations where higher prices are paid for agricultural products \nand there are more job opportunities than in the project area. Reductions in transport costs will be \npassed on to the users of the transport services. This will improve the terms of trade for poor \nfarmers in the project area by lowering the costs of agricultural inputs and increasing prices for \nagricultural outputs, such as vegetables and livestock (Supplementary Appendix A). The improved \nroad condition will increase the number of traders traveling to the project area to buy produce. The \nProject will also improve access to social services in Osh, and the advisory TA will increase \nawareness of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking (paras. 41\u201342). \n \n51.  The Project will encourage the hiring of poor people from the project area for unskilled and \nsemiskilled labor, and will encourage the hiring of women who head households, as well as \ndisadvantaged women in general. While the employment opportunities from the Project will only \nyield short-term direct benefits to the poor, the indirect impacts on poverty will be longer term. \nAccording to surveys conducted by the TA consultants and the Fact-Finding Mission, 50% of the \nresidents of the communities along the project road are indebted; the income from employment \ncan be used to pay off these debts. The residents also indicate that they will use the income from \nshort-term employment to invest in income-generating activities, such as processing of locally \nproduced materials and producing higher value crops and livestock. \n \n52.  The civil works under the Project include construction of a roadside station at Sopu \nKorgon. The roadside station will reduce poverty by providing employment opportunities and also \na site for selling local products. Employment will be generated for providing vehicle and food \nservices, as only a very limited number of outlets for these services are available between Gulcha \nand the the PRC border. The roadside station will also increase incomes for poor farmers and ", " 16 \nothers by providing a site at which they can sell agricultural produce and handicrafts without \nhaving to transport the goods long distances to markets.  \n \n53.  The Project will maximize the poverty-reduction impact of projects being implemented by \nADB and other international agencies. Three ADB-financed projects are improving social services \nin the project area: [Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project15 (drinking water \nsupply), Education Sector Development Project,16 and Social Services Delivery and Finance \nProject.]17 The United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank are implementing \ncomprehensive  poverty  reduction  activities,  including  microfinance,  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure,  small  business  development,  and  other  agriculture-related  income  generation \nactivities. Other agencies, including the Global Ecological Fund and German Agro Action, are \nimplementing agricultural projects focusing on small-scale agribusiness activities and farmers. \nMany other agencies are active in the project area as well. By improving transport in the project \narea, the Project will facilitate the transport of the increased agricultural production to markets, \nand thus contribute to the maximization of the poverty-reduction impact of these projects. \n \nD.  Social Impact and Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n54.  Key social issues were analyzed during the social analysis conducted as part of the \nregional TA (footnote 3) that prepared the Project and were further developed during project \nprocessing.  The  project  design  was  discussed  in  detail  with  local  government  officials  and \nrepresentatives  of  the  affected  communities.  During  project  preparation,  the  regional  TA \nconsultants conducted a detailed survey of 300 households in the project area. The communities \nare aware of the Project and the implications for their welfare; they support the Project. Although \nnot cited as a major concern in the social survey, HIV/AIDS and human trafficking are new and \nincreasing problems. While the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS remains relatively low, the number \nof cases in the country has been increasing rapidly\u2014from one reported case in 1996 to 583 as of \nAugust 2004. In 2003, Osh Oblast, in which the project area is located, had the highest incidence \nof any of the country\u2019s oblasts, with 239 cases of AIDS, including two detected in Alai raion, which \ncomprises part of the project area. Also, due to its geographic location and economic situation, the \nKyrgyz Republic is a country both of origin and transit of victims of human trafficking. About 4,000 \nwomen were reported to have been victims of human trafficking in 1999. The human trafficking \nproblem is also most severe in Osh Oblast. Although most HIV/AIDS cases in the country are \ntransmitted by intravenous drug use, the Project may contribute to the HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking problems, and therefore negatively impact women, by increasing the number of foreign \nworkers  during  construction  and  transit  traffic  following  project  completion.  To  mitigate  this \npotential impact, an attached advisory TA will be provided to increase awareness and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking (paras. 41\u201342). In addition, the project supervision \nconsultants  will  include  a  domestic  consultant  to  monitor  these  issues.  The  contractors  will \ndistribute  information  to  project  workers,  and  the  Project  will  coordinate  with  agencies  and \nnongovernment organizations involved in HIV/AIDS and trafficking prevention activities \n \n55.  Other than the HIV/AIDS and trafficking issues, the Project will have no adverse impact on \nvulnerable groups and no negative implication for gender concerns or indigenous people. No \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2000.

The Government \nagreed to ensure that the Project is implemented, to the extent possible, with active participation \nof  the  project  beneficiaries,  using  participatory  practices,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  handbook, \nMainstreaming Participatory Development Processes. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n \n56.  The project classification is environment category B. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) of the Project was carried out under the regional TA (footnote 3) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Review  Procedures,  and \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that the Project \nwill not have any major adverse environmental impact as it involves mainly rehabilitation of the \nexisting alignment of the project road (except for minor realignments due to difficult geotechnical \nconditions). The Project will not entail any land acquisition or resettlement. The Osh- Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam road crosses the Bel-Ulim State Forest Reserve at one point (between Sopu Korgon \nand Sary Tash) beyond the sections being rehabilitated under the Project. The increased traffic \nresulting from the Project will not have any impact on the reserve. Furthermore, rehabilitation of \nthis part of the road under a future project is not expected to have any significant impact on the \nreserve, as changes in the alignment are not anticipated. The summary IEE is in Appendix 12. \n \nF.  Road Safety \n \n57.  The total number of road accidents in the Kyrgyz Republic increased from 1,135 in 1999 \nto 1,555 in 2003. On the project road the annual number of accidents ranged from 21 in 2001 to \n41 in 2003, with the annual number of deaths ranging from 5 in 2001 to 29 in 2003, and injuries \nfrom 20 in 2001 to 92 in 2003. The primary cause of accidents is excessive driving speed on \nroads in mountainous terrain. Many roads outside of the cities, including the project road, pass \nthrough  mountainous  terrain  and/or  alongside  rivers,  with  the  road  alignment  varying \nsignificantly along the same road and sometimes changing suddenly. The mountainous terrain \nalso results in significant rockfall hazards on many roads, including the project road. During the \nwinter season, ice- and snow-covered roads comprise a major safety hazard. The absence of \nrest areas and roadside service facilities over long distances may also contribute to accidents. \n \n58.  ADB has been significantly involved in improving road safety in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nthrough the Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) and the Almaty-Bishkek Regional \nRoad Rehabilitation Project (footnote 10). The Second Road Rehabilitation Project prepared a \ntime-bound road safety program to reduce the accident rate. Under the Almaty-Bishkek Project, \nthe Government established the Road Safety Committee and the committee\u2019s secretariat in April \n2004 to coordinate road safety activities and involve the various stakeholders. The secretariat has \nbegun its work, including preparing a road accident database and other safety information. The \nGovernment also agreed to update the Road Safety Act for submission to Parliament. The act will \ninclude legislation concerning safe driving, safety audit of road designs, safety education, road \nsafety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety research, and emergency assistance to \naccident  victims.  The  advisory  TA18  attached  to  the  Almaty-Bishkek  Project  has  helped  the \nGovernment establish the National Road Safety Council, update the Road Safety Act, prepare a \nRussian version of the Road Safety Guidelines prepared under an earlier TA,19 and conduct road \nsafety seminars to implement the guidelines.  \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2000.

The rehabilitation works under the Project will substantially improve road safety. The \nProject also includes several measures to improve road safety, in addition to improving the road \nsurface,  where  extensive  deterioration  results  in  unsafe  driving  conditions,  and  replacing \ndeteriorated bridges. The installation and maintenance of proper signage and lane markings to \nhighlight changes in alignment and other safety hazards will be emphasized. The supervision \nconsultants will prepare an inventory of slopes subject to rockfalls and landslides, and prepare \nslope mitigation measures to be included in the Project\u2019s civil works. The Project includes a \nseparate civil works contract to (i) provide road furniture and implement other measures to \nimprove road safety at the Taldyk Pass (between Sopu Korgon and Sary Tash, outside the \nproject road sections to be rehabilitated), and (ii) construct a roadside station. Snow removal \nequipment  to  improve  road  safety  during  the  winter  will  be  included  in  the  maintenance \nequipment to be procured. The supervision consultants will also examine the possibility of \nestablishing rest areas. Consulting services include an international road safety expert, who will \nconduct a road safety audit, advise MOTC on enforcement measures to improve road safety, \nand provide TA for incorporating road-safety features in the project design. Domestic consulting \nservices will also address road safety. In addition, the Government has agreed on vehicle-\nweighing measures to be implemented as part of the Project (para. 62). By March 2005, the \nGovernment will establish rules and procedures to implement the June 2004 parliamentary decree \non weighing vehicles. The Government will also ensure that a vehicle weighing system becomes \noperational  on  the  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam  road  (including  installation  and  use  of \nweighing equipment at selected entry points and enforcement of rules) by December 2005. \n \nG.  Project Risks \n \n60.  The Project is designed to reduce potential risks, including delays in implementation due \nto inadequate implementation capacity of MOTC, failure to provide counterpart financing in a \ntimely manner, lower than projected traffic, and inadequate road maintenance. The Project \nincludes several measures to mitigate the risk of implementation delays. MOTC will create a \nPIU to implement the Project, and has identified the number and type of additional staff be \nhired. The detailed design has been completed. ADB has approved advance action. MOTC has \nextensive experience with ADB procedures and will be able to make full use of the advance \naction provisions. Given the high priority that the Government assigns to the Project (para.2), the \nGovernment will make every effort to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds. In addition, \nADB and the Government are closely monitoring the Public Investment Program restrictions \nagreed to by the Government and the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the Project does \nnot cause disbursements to exceed agreed limits. \n \n61.  There  is  some  risk  that  the  traffic  forecast  will  not  materialize,  especially  for  the \ninternational generated traffic arising from increased trade, from which some of the border- \ncrossing  fees  arise.  In  particular,  obstacles  to  trade  and  traffic  moving  across  the  border \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan may continue to be a problem. To address this \nrisk, the advisory TA includes facilitation of regional cooperation and development of a regional \nagency to manage the overall transport corridor. If the project road is not properly maintained, \nthe full benefits of the Project will not be realized. The Government is aware of the importance \nof  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the  project  area,  which  is  mountainous  and  prone  to \nlandslides  and  rockfalls.  The  project  design  includes  elements  to  address  the  risks  of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the  project  road.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  loan  assurances  requiring  the  allocation  of  specific  levels  of \nfinancing for maintaining the project road, as well as increased financing for road maintenance \n ", " 19\nnationally. The Project includes procurement of road maintenance equipment, solely for use on \nthe project road. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.   Specific Assurances \n \n62.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand resources necessary for rehabilitating the Osh-Gulcha-Sopu Korgon road (the \nproject  road),  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  entire  Osh-Sary  Tash-\nIrkeshtam road in accordance with the financing plan agreed for the Project. The \nGovernment will ensure that the Ministry of Finance takes all necessary measures \nto ensure that MOTC can successfully implement rehabilitation of the project road, \nand operate and maintain it after project completion. Before the end of each year, \nthe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  public  investment  program  for  the \nsucceeding year, demonstrating availability of necessary funds and resources for \nrehabilitation, operation and maintenance, and management of the project road. \n \n(ii)  Cofinancing. In the event of any shortfall in project financing due to the absence \nof  cofinancing  from  other  sources,  the  Government  will  provide  additional \ncounterpart funds necessary to implement the Project. \n \n(iii)  Corridor  management  department.  The  Government  will  ensure  MOTC \nestablishes  by  31  December  2006  and  provides  the  necessary  funding  for  a \ncorridor  management  department  within  MOTC.  The  department,  whose \norganizational  structure  will  be  approved  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will  be \nresponsible for operation of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road corridor, including \ncollecting border-crossing fees, tendering contracts for road maintenance, and \nmaintaining adequate standards of road safety and other corridor operations. \n \n(iv)  Border-crossing fees. The Government will take necessary measures to put in \noperation, by the completion of the Project\u2019s civil works, a system of border-\ncrossing fees (to replace the current permit system) for buses and freight vehicles \ncrossing  the  PRC-Kyrgyz  and  Kyrgyz-Uzbekistan  borders  using  the  border \ncrossings on the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road. \n \n(v)  The border-crossing fee will be set at no less than an average of Som850 per \nvehicle for each one-way crossing (adjusted annually for inflation after 2004). Fee \ncollection will begin upon completion of the Project\u2019s civil works. The fee schedule, \ndesigned  in  accordance  with  the  legislation  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for review prior to implementation. \n \n(vi)  The border-crossing fees will be accumulated in MOTC\u2019s account in the Treasury. \nThe full amount will be made available to MOTC for maintaining the entire Osh-\nSary Tash-Irkeshtam road, operating the corridor management department, and \nmaintaining other MOTC-administered roads. \n ", " 20 \n(vii)  Vehicle  weighing.

Background \n \n1.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country. Road transport dominates \nthe country's transport system, accounting for about 94% of freight tonnage movements and \nalmost all passenger traffic (excluding intra-urban) in 2001. The railway network consists of \nseparate branch lines that link the north of the country to the Kazakhstan rail system, and the \nsouth of the country to the Uzbekistan system, with no direct connection between the two links. \nAir transport accounts for less than 1% of passenger movements, mainly between Bishkek and \nOsh. Water transport is confined to a few vessels on Lake Issyk-Kul. \n \n2.  As with most other republics of the former Soviet Union, the economic crisis stemming \nfrom the breakup of the former Soviet Union resulted in a decline in economic activity and \ndisrupted customary trading patterns. The demand for transport has fallen dramatically since \nindependence. In 2001, freight turnover (measured in ton-kilometers [km]) was only 20% of its \n1990 level and passenger turnover was 57% of its previous level.1 The lowest levels were \nreached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton-km and passenger movements were only 14% \nand 33% of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting a sharp decline in real incomes and output. \nDemand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight decreased again following the 1998 financial crisis. \nPassenger transport has been growing at about 6% annually since 1997. \n \n3.  The  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  covers  all  seven  provinces  (oblasts),  and \nprovides connections to remote communities and links to neighboring countries. About 18,900 km \nof roads are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC): \n9,900 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads. About 40% of the roads are sealed, \nincluding some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50% are gravel and less than 10% \nare earth roads. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacity and are \nunderutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the level of economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion or \nmajor upgrading of the transport system, but proper maintenance and rehabilitation to preserve \nthe  existing  network.  Roads  at  all  levels  are  deteriorating;  over  60%  now  require  periodic \nmaintenance or rehabilitation. About 15,000 km of roads are outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly \nrural and farm roads. Most were formerly the responsibility of state and collective farms. The \nresponsibility for maintaining rural and farm roads is now with the district administrations following \nthe breakup of the state and collective farm system. \n \n4.  The Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administering \nroad  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC,  which  is  responsible  for  policymaking  and \nregulating, planning, and developing transport and communications, including the road, railway, \nand aviation sectors. The Department of Roads, under MOTC, is responsible for managing the \nroad sector. MOTC's seven regional road maintenance agencies, one in each province, plus the \nBishkek-Osh Road Division are responsible for maintaining the state and local roads under \nMOTC's jurisdiction. The regional road maintenance agencies and Bishkek-Osh Road Division \ncomprise 58 local maintenance units that carry out actual maintenance works. Other important \nagencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport \ncompanies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; and (ii) technical \nagencies  in  various  stages  of  divestment  from  MOTC\u2019s  control,  including  the  Road  Design \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003.

Sector Issues and Need for Reform \n \n1.  Road Transport Industry \n \n5.  Transport  companies  were  controlled  by  a  joint-stockholding  company,  Kyrgyz  Auto \nTransport until 1994, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions to \nMOTC. Of the total 251 transport enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been privatized, \nprimarily  through  conversion  to  joint-stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies  provide  road \ntransport  services;  74  have  been  privatized.  The  companies  that  have  not  been  privatized \ncomprise  urban  bus  enterprises  in  major  cities  and  some  enterprises  connected  with  state \nsecurity. The transport companies employ about 25,000. Most of the freight and passenger \ntransport companies operate at the provincial and district (raion) level, with a small number of \nnational operators. As a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 to increase \ncompetition, most of the national and provincial holding companies and associations (which had \ncontinued  to  exercise  control  over  the  operations  of  individual  transport  companies)  were \nabolished. \n \n6.  The Government continues to have a strong influence in the market for intercity passenger \ntransport. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created in MOTC in 1994, issues transport licenses and \nregulates transport services. The market for freight transport services is more competitive than \nthat for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions of price \nand quality of service directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate \nand arrange intermodal transport services, thus facilitating door-to-door transport arrangements, \nand to offer services directly themselves. However, the Government also plays a large role in \nfreight transport through regulation. MOTC is responsible for monitoring and regulation, including \nlicensing, inspection, and safety audits. Increased competitiveness of the markets for transport \nservices is necessary to improve transport services and ensure that the reductions in transport \ncosts are passed on to transport users. The Government has made substantial efforts to privatize \nroad construction and maintenance operations. All of the 29 road construction enterprises have \nbeen privatized. The uncertainty relating to the road construction program of the Department of \nRoads has hindered development of the private road construction industry. However, ADB's \nongoing road rehabilitation projects have assisted in developing the privatized road construction \nenterprises through extensive subcontracting by the civil works contractors. \n \n2.  Financing of Road Maintenance \n \n7.  Financing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate \nfor the country\u2019s needs. Total road sector financing from all sources is shown in Table A2.1. \n \nTable A2.1: Summary Road Sector Financing in the Kyrgyz Republic ($ million) \nItem    2000  2001  2002  2003  2004a  2005b \nMaintenance  2.880  4.254  3.863  5.445  6.541  5.308 \nRehabilitation  24.860  27.308  22.802  11.645  27.887  20.466 \nOther  0.000  0.001  0.000  0.001  0.000  0.000 \n  Total  27.740  31.562  26.665  17.090  34.428  25.775 \na  From approved budget and supplemental allocations and reallocations as of 11 October 2004. \nb  From draft 2005 budget. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications and Ministry of Finance. \n   ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n \n8.  With technical assistance (TA) financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),2 the \nGovernment passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and, as specified in the loan covenants for the \nSecond Road Rehabilitation Project, 3 is collecting road user charges prescribed under the act. \nAccording to the Road Fund Act, a portion of the road sector revenues should be deposited into a \nseparate road fund account. The specific sources of revenue for the road fund are (i) 50% of the \nexcise taxes on fuel, (ii) 100% of the 0.8% tax on enterprises, (iii) 100% of the tax on vehicle \nowners, (iv) 90% of vehicle registration fees, (v) charges for the use of toll roads and tunnels, (vi) \ncharges for oversize and overweight vehicles, (vii) state budget allocations, and (viii) foreign loans \nand grants. In view of the severe fiscal problems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic, ADB waived a \nloan covenant requiring the establishment of a separate dedicated road fund account, although \nthe collection of road user charges in accordance with the Road Fund Act is continuing. At \npresent, the Ministry of Finance makes annual allocations for road maintenance and other road \nsector expenditures based on overall budget considerations. Road sector financing by source and \ntype is shown in Table A2.2. The allocations have been inadequate to meet the sector\u2019s needs. \nTotal Government road sector expenditures ranged from $5.8 to $11.4 million during 2000\u20132003, \npeaking in 2002.

Expenditures on road maintenance accounted for at least half of the Government\u2019s road \nsector expenditures during 2000\u20132003, except for 2002. Expenditures for road maintenance \nincreased from about $2.9 to $5.4 million during 2000\u20132003, with about $6.5 and $5.3 million per \nyear planned for 2004 and 2005, respectively.

The Government has substantially complied with the covenant, despite facing overall fiscal \nconstraints  as  well  as  demands  to  repair  infrastructure  damaged  by  natural  disasters.  The \nGovernment\u2019s actual expenditures for maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh road in 2002, 2003, and \n2004 exceeded the levels required by the loan covenant.5 The Government\u2019s compliance with the \nfirst component of the covenant demonstrates that ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has been effective in \nensuring that sufficient financing is provided to ensure the sustainability of the Government\u2019s \ninvestment in rehabilitating key national roads. While the expenditures for maintenance for all \nother  roads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction  for  2002\u20132004  fell  short  of  the  required  amount,  the \nshortfalls in 2002 and 2003 were only 11% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, the combined \namounts for the Bishkek-Osh road as well as other MOTC roads are virtually in compliance with \nthe required levels for 2002\u20132003, and the total amount for 2004 is 25% higher than in 2002. \nAlthough the Government has substantially complied with the maintenance-financing covenant, it \nis likely to continue to face fiscal constraints. As a result, the Government and ADB have agreed \non an action plan for developing and implementing a new strategy to ensure adequate road \nmaintenance, shown in Table A2.4.

Government Strategy \n \n11.  The Government's transport strategy and plans are included in the Transport and Road \nSector Policy Statement, prepared under ADB TA (footnote 2). The Government's overall policy \nobjectives for transport include (i) adequately maintaining transport infrastructure to support the \nreform of the economy; (ii) privatizing transport operations and promoting competition among \noperators, while addressing safety and environmental concerns; and (iii) increasing cost recovery \nfrom the users of transport infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, the Government's strategy \nincludes (i) increasing the financial provision for rehabilitating and maintaining the road network; \n(ii)  consolidating  road  sector  responsibilities  under  MOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation in road maintenance; (iv) completing the privatization of road transport operations \nand dismantling licensing controls, which hinder competition; (v) promoting, in collaboration with \nneighboring countries, rail transport as the most efficient means of transporting bulk loads over \nlong distances; (vi) privatizing lake shipping services; (vii) promoting civil aviation infrastructure \nand supporting services that encourage foreign and local airline operations; and (viii) increasing \nroad sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation. \n \nD.  Asian Development Bank Support for Strategy Implementation \n \n12.  ADB has been involved in the Kyrgyz road sector since 1996, implementing three projects \nfor the rehabilitation of the Bishkek-Osh road, and one for the Bishkek-Almaty Road, for a total of \n$145 million. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector has been guided by its sector strategy and \nbeen  instrumental  in  improving  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework,  providing  institutional \nstrengthening for MOTC and other sector institutions, preparing a road maintenance plan, and \nmobilizing additional resources from other agencies. ADB is playing a leading role in providing \npolicy advice, capacity building, and capital financing for the Kyrgyz road sector, and has provided \nseven TA grants worth $4.2 million. ADB has been involved in policy dialogue for transport in the \nKyrgyz Republic since 1996. It has focused on transport regulation; financing of the road sector, \nparticularly  road  maintenance;  and  road  safety.  The  policy  dialogue  for  the  Third  Road \nRehabilitation Project (footnote 3), ADB\u2019s most recent road sector project, focused primarily on \nroad  maintenance  financing  and  practices,  making  markets  for  transport  services  more \ncompetitive, and implementing reforms in MOTC\u2019s financial management. \n \n13.  ADB has helped MOTC streamline management of the road sector. In conjunction with the \npolicy dialogue under the Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3) and following the \npassage of Law No. 8 on Transport and issuance of Decree No. 419 in 1998, MOTC was \nrestructured to improve its efficiency. As part of the restructuring, a Government decree was \nissued in January 1999 requiring consolidation of the administration of transport-related activities. \nThis  resulted  in  a  restructuring  of  responsibilities  among  the  Ministry  of  Architecture  and \nConstruction,  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  and  MOTC.  In  1998,  the  Directorate  General  for \nRehabilitation and Maintenance of the Bishkek-Osh road was integrated into the Department of \nRoads. The Government transferred responsibilities for developing road design and construction \nstandards from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction to MOTC, and in 1999 the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs and MOTC agreed to jointly administer the functions of road safety and traffic \nmanagement, while leaving the responsibility for vehicle inspection with the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs.  To  determine  the  broad  expenditure  priorities  in  accordance  with  road  traffic,  road \nconditions, and possible types of intervention, ADB is assisting MOTC, through the institutional \nstrengthening TA, 6 to review the existing planning and budgeting practices for road maintenance, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

The TA, Policy Support in the Transport Sector,7 made \nrecommendations for improving financial management in MOTC. The Government has agreed to \nimplement the recommendations. \n \n14.  ADB is addressing issues affecting competitiveness of the market for passenger and \nfreight transport services through policy dialogue and provision of TA. The ongoing advisory TA \nfor institutional strengthening includes a component to analyze the markets for transport services \nand  give  recommendations  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  markets  to  maximize  the \npoverty reduction impact of the Third Road Rehabilitation Project. Another TA will also study the \nimpact of the measures to increase competitiveness on the poorest part of the population, and \nany additional measures to ensure that the poorest are not negatively affected by regulatory \nchanges or other proposed measures. The Government has agreed to implement the regulatory \nchanges recommended by the TA to improve the competitiveness of the markets for transport \nservices to ensure that the project benefits are passed on to the poor. \n \n15.  ADB has also been working with MOTC to improve the equipment and methods used for \nroad maintenance. Under the Second Road Rehabilitation Project, a maintenance manual was \nprepared, and a training program for maintenance personnel was implemented. Maintenance \nequipment for the Bishkek-Osh road was purchased through the cofinanced portion of the first \nRoad Rehabilitation Project.8 While the Government wants to retain the local maintenance units \nas  part  of  MOTC,  it  has  undertaken  measures,  with  ADB  assistance,  to  contract  out  road \nmaintenance  activities.  Under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  the  Government  has \ninvited bids from local contractors to undertake routine maintenance on a section of the Bishkek-\nOsh road. Under the Third Road Rehabilitation Project, MOTC will invite bids from contractors for \nroutine  maintenance  on  all  sections  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  for  which  the  construction \ncontractor's warranty period has expired. Policy dialogue under ADB's early projects focused on \nmaintaining national roads. However, the Third Road Rehabilitation Project, which is improving \nsecondary  roads  along  with  sections  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road,  will  extend  improved  road \nmaintenance  practices  to  secondary  roads  as  well.  The  institutional  strengthening  TA  is \ndeveloping a system for maintaining secondary roads based on collaboration between the local \nmaintenance  units  and  local  communities,  which  will  help  ensure  that  the  poverty-reduction \nbenefits  of  improving  secondary  roads  will  be  sustained.  MOTC  has  agreed  to  ensure  the \nmaintenance of secondary roads rehabilitated under the Third Road Rehabilitation Project by \npreparing the local maintenance units assigned to the Project\u2019s secondary roads to operate the \nnew maintenance system, including procuring appropriate maintenance equipment and enacting \nor modifying any necessary regulations.  \n \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998.

N.A.    No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: The road sector is the most \nimportant transport mode in the Kyrgyz Republic, accounting for about 94% of freight tonnage movements and almost \nall passenger traffic. Rehabilitating road sector infrastructure contributes directly to poverty reduction by reducing \ntransportation costs and improving access to economic opportunities and social services, and indirectly by stimulating \neconomic development. The road sector\u2019s linkages to other countries provide opportunities for subsistence farmers \nand other poor to engage in higher value agricultural production and to participate in other income-generating and \nemployment opportunities outside the country. Given the limited size of domestic markets, roads linking to markets \nabroad are crucial for the country\u2019s sustainable economic development and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Osh oblast (province), where the project is located, is the fourth poorest \namong the seven oblasts in the Kyrgyz Republic, comprising about one fourth of the poor in the country. The \nexpenditure-based poverty level in Osh in 2003 was estimated at 49% percent compared to the national average of \n41%. The project areas include Kara Suu and Alai raions (districts). Alai raion is one of the poorest districts in the \ncountry, and of its surveyed villages the unemployment rate is estimated at 70\u201395% excluding subsistence farming \nand occasional and part-time work. Deteriorated roads are among a number of problems impeding sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. According to a survey conducted during project preparation, road improvement is \nranked as the most important action to reduce poverty (90%), followed by more jobs for local people (89%), increasing \nallowances and pensions with inflation (80%), and better access to distant markets (71%). Only 55% of the surveyed \nhouseholds currently transport their products to markets due to the poor road. Due to the limited access to markets, \nthey have been consuming very few varieties of foods, causing health problems. Almost all the households, including \nthe poor, believe the improved roads will (i) enable more local goods to be transported to distant markets; (ii) enable \nmore goods from outside to be available in local markets and shops; (iii) increase traffic flow; (iv) reduce time for \ntransport; (v) reduce the number of accidents; (vi) reduce the damage to goods being transported; and (vii) enhance \nthe communication between villages and the oblast center. Villagers indicated that they plan to diversify their \nagricultural production to higher value crops and enhance livestock activities following road improvement; develop \nprocessing industries, such as wood, leather, and potatoes; establish a handicraft industry for women (e.g., beddings \nand carpet); and increase provision of roadside services and transport services. Also, traders in Gulcha and Osh \nmarkets indicated that they would go more often to the project area to buy local products. The result of all these could \nimprove the terms of trade of poor farmers.  \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit about 67,000 people, including about 38,000 poor. The Project will contribute to \npoverty reduction by facilitating trade; facilitating transport of local agricultural produce to markets; improving access to \nsocial services; creating jobs for project implementation; reducing transport costs; providing income generation \nopportunities through construction of a roadside station; and maximizing the poverty-reduction benefits from other \nprojects being implemented in the project area. The Project also includes construction of a roadside station, which will \nreduce poverty by providing employment opportunities and also a site for selling local products. Complementary \npoverty reduction activities in the project area include microfinance, physical and social infrastructure projects, and \nsmall-scale  business  development,  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  bilateral  government \ndevelopment agencies, nongovernment organizations, Government, United Nations Development Programme, and \nthe World Bank. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes    No  \nA detailed survey of 300 households was conducted during project preparation along the road from Osh to Irkeshtam. \nConsultation meetings were held in ten villages among people with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Local \nresidents indicated strong support for the Project, with high expectations of opportunities for income generation. The \nFact-Finding Mission also consulted with local residents, village heads, regional and local officials, nongovernment \norganizations, local consultants, and international organizations. All of them support the Project. \n ", "34 Appendix 3 \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe contractors will be encouraged to maximize use of local labor, subcontractors, and local materials. Monitoring of \nsocial and economic progress is included in project supervision services. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nAlthough  not  cited  as  a  major  concern  in  the  social  survey,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human trafficking are new and increasing problems in the Osh region. While \nthe overall incidence of HIV/AIDS remains relatively low, the number of cases in the region has been increasing \nrapidly. By increasing transit traffic following project completion and the number of foreign workers during construction, \nthe Project may contribute to the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking problems and therefore negatively impact women. \nOther than the HIV/AIDS and trafficking issues, the Project will have no adverse impact on vulnerable groups and no \nnegative implication for gender concerns.  \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: To mitigate the potential impact of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted \ninfection (STI) and human trafficking issues, an advisory technical assistance (TA) is being provided (Appendix 9). In \naddition, the project supervision consultants will include a domestic consultant to provide training and increase \nawareness of these issues. The contractors will distribute information to project workers, and the Project will \ncoordinate  with  international  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  involved  in  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking \nprevention activities. The domestic consultant will be an expert on gender, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking to help the \nMinistry of Transport and Communications ensure that critical and gender-relevant issues are addressed during \nproject implementation. These issues include women's participation during all phases of project implementation, and \nprovision of equal employment and wage opportunities for women employed in the project sites. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Objectives \n \n1.  The main objectives of the technical assistance (\u0422\u0410) are to help the Ministry of Transport \nand  Communications  (MOTC)  in  (i)  improve  its  utilization  of  the  limited  financing  for  road \nmaintenance, and (ii) strengthen the operations of the management department of the Osh-\nSaryTash-Irkeshtam transport corridor. \n \nB.  Scope of Consulting Services \n \n2.  In collaboration with MOTC, the consultants will (i) develop proposals for improving \nutilization of the national road maintenance budget; (ii) help review and update the corridor \nanalysis, including traffic projections and operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) help MOTC \nestablish and make operational the corridor department institutional structure and the corridor \nregional executive management agency; systems for setting and collection of tolls, financial \nmanagement,  maintenance  management,  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  for  the \ntransport corridor, and traffic facilitation. Consulting services will be conducted over 12 months, \nrequiring approximately 20 person-months of international and 105 person-months of domestic \ninput. In addition, the TA will provide equipment, office supplies, and instruments required for \nthe TA implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged through a consulting firm \nfollowing the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used,  and  a  simplified \ntechnical proposal will be requested from the consulting firms. \n \nC.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n3.  \u041c\u041e\u0422C will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing the \u0422\u0410. MOTC's \nproject implementation unit will serve as the liaison between \u041c\u041e\u0422C and the consultants, and be \nresponsible for overall project management. The \u0422\u0410 will complement the proposed Southern \nTransport Corridor Road Project. \n \nD.   Terms of Reference \n \n1.  Road Maintenance \n(international, 10 person-months and domestic, 50 person-months) \n \n    a.  Improve Utilization of Road Maintenance Budget \n \n4.  Analyze the current network of roads under MOTC authorization, and reclassify them by \n(i) importance (e.g., strategic, traffic levels), (ii) condition, and (iii) type, so that maintenance \nfinancing can be allocated according to the priority of the road.  \n \n5.  Based on the reports from the TA, Institutional Support in the Transport Sector,1 prepare \nestimates for routine and periodic maintenance costs (per kilometer) for the categories of roads \n                                                      \n1  ADB. 2001. Proposed Technical Assistance Grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for Institutional Support in the Transport \nSector. Manila. \n ", "40 Appendix 8 \nprepared under task 1 (para. 4). The estimates should take into account the mountainous \ntopography of the country, design standards of the roads, and techniques for minimizing costs \n(e.g., labor-intensiveness, type of equipment). \n \n6.  Prepare estimates of total maintenance costs for each category of roads prepared under \ntask 1, in terms of total recommended for sufficient maintenance to keep current conditions, \nminimal amount necessary to keep passable, etc.  \n \n7.  Based on the total amount of financing likely under current/projected (next 5 years) \nbudget conditions, prepare recommended allocation of maintenance financing by road category \nand implications for the overall network. \n \n8.  Prepare a methodology for allocating maintenance funds for each category of roads in \nthe  future. The  methodology  would  provide  a  basis/formulas  that  could  be  applied  to  any \nallocation of maintenance to ensure that whatever financing is available is allocated to the \nhighest priority roads and thus used most effectively. \n \n9.  Prepare proposals for alternative means of maintaining MOTC roads that do not rely \nsubstantially on financing from the national budget, for example, applying to national roads the \ncommunity-based maintenance techniques prepared under the institutional strengthening TA \n(footnote 1). \n \n    b.  Maintenance Management System \n \n10.  Review  the  existing  maintenance  assets  (depots,  equipment,  human  resources), \nmanagement structures, and practices used to maintain the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtan road. \n \n11.  Taking  into  account  work  done  under  previous  ADB  TAs,  design  a  maintenance \nmanagement  system  appropriate  to  the  harsh  physical  conditions  of  the  road,  and  the \nmanagement structure of the corridor. The system should address the following: (i) routine road \ncondition monitoring (e.g., only by visible survey and/or using robust equipment); (ii) traffic \ncounting and axle weighing (e.g., pneumatic counting, but no weigh-in-motion); (iii) road safety \nmonitoring and improvements; (iv) allowance for exceptional climatic conditions, the normal \nseasonality, and routine winter maintenance; (v) projections of pavement deterioration, and \nidentification and special attention to sections sensitive to snow drifting, erosion, flooding, etc.; \n(vi) programming of maintenance actions on a responsive and timely basis; (vii) emergency \nvehicle recovery (after breakdown) and rescue services from isolated sections of the road; (viii) \ncost  estimates  of  maintenance  requirements,  using  whatever  basis  best  matches  the \ncontracting arrangements; (ix) services and works procurement by force account, unit rate \ncontracting, performance contracting, or combinations of these; and (x) quality procedures for \nmaintenance  works  (possibly  involving  user  groups,  and  the  corridor  regional  executive \nmanagement agency). A maintenance management system should be developed, and training \nprovided to MOTC staff in Osh and in Bishkek in collaboration with local staff. \n \n12.  Review existing model conditions of contracts for the maintenance services, and works \ncontracts in use in or developed for the Kyrgyz Republic, including the Bishkek-Osh road, and \ndraft any suggested changes. Advise on tendering procedures to procure the maintenance \nservices. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 8  41 \nc.  Maintenance Equipment \n \n13.  Help prepare specifications and procurement documents for maintenance equipment to \nbe procured under the Project. Develop a plan for the use of this and other available equipment. \nThe plan should consider leasing or rental or direct works, and include (i) optimal use of the \nequipment to maintain an appropriate level of service of the road; (ii) programmed maintenance \nof the equipment itself and avoidance of wasteful or abusive use, and rapid depreciation through \nneglected maintenance; (iii) limitations on the use of the equipment for purposes other than \nmaintenance of the project road (in discussion with the Government and ADB); (iv) financial \nprovision for the eventual renewal of the equipment; (v) training of staff in programming the \nmaintenance of equipment, spares, procurement, etc; (vi) training in the costing of use of the \nequipment; and (vii) drafting of the legal instruments required to set up the entity, which will own \nthe  equipment.  Labor-based  maintenance  methods  are  to  be  encouraged,  to  maximize \nemployment opportunities for the communities living along the road corridor. \n \n14.  Recommend  a  program  for  transformation  (or  abandonment)  of  the  existing \nmaintenance management assets and structures, into a technical or contracts management \ndepartment of the corridor. Recommend divestiture procedures of any redundant assets, and \nthe acquisition of any additional resources beyond those to be procured under the Project. \n \n2.  Transport Corridor Department Institutional Strengthening and Legal \n  Support (international, 5 person-months and domestic, 35 person-months)  \n \na.  Corridor Department Institutional Structure \n \n15.  The consultant will prepare an action plan of the steps needed to establish this structure \nas  a  working  entity,  starting  from  the  present  institutional  situation.  Establish  if  legislative \nchanges are required. Draft the new or revised laws, regulations, and/or charter needed. Check \ntheir preliminary acceptability with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance.  \n \nb.  Corridor Regional Executive Management Agency \n \n16.  Organize two workshops or conferences in Bishkek during the course of the Project to \ndiscuss the establishment of a corridor regional executive management agency. Delegates are \nto be invited from the People's Republic of China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, in addition to the \nKyrgyz Republic. The purpose of the agency would include promotion of coordinated regional \neconomic development along the Fergana Valley-Kashgar corridor, including the project road. \nBased on the results of the conferences, provide follow-up support to establish the corridor \nregional executive management agency, including estimating its annual administrative cost, and \nhow to integrate its organization and functioning with the corridor. The ultimate aim would be to \nmerge the regional agency with the corridor management department. \n \nc.  Traffic Facilitation \n \n17.  Examine with the Government the present border-crossing, border-security issues, and \ncross-border-trading restraints, including security controls, customs procedures, and any other \nnonphysical impediments to traffic. Assess the limitations that these place on the development \nof traffic, and quantify the effect this will have on traffic levels, toll collection, and the success of \nthe corridor. Prepare a draft action plan to address these impediments. \n \n ", "42 Appendix 8 \n3.  Financial Management and Analysis \n(international, 5 person-months and domestic, 20 person-months) \n \na.  Review and Update of Corridor Analysis \n \n18.  Review the corridor analysis, prepared under the regional TA2 including the corridor \nregional  executive  management  agency  recommendations,  traffic  forecast,  and  financial \nprojections  including  projected  debt  repayment  and  maintenance  costs.  Update  the  traffic \nforecasts  and  financial  projections.  Update  the  cash-flow  projections,  including the  various \noptions for toll rates. Establish spreadsheets to revise these projections, as necessary, for \ndiscussions with the Government and throughout the Project. \n \nb.  Setting and Collection of Tolls \n \n19.  Taking into account the revised cash-flow projections, discuss with the Government (i) \nthe toll levels, and (ii) the mechanisms for imposing tolls (e.g., transformation of the existing \npermit system, establishment of toll booths). Help the Government prepare a proposal on tolls \nand their collection for ADB approval. Develop mechanisms to ensure that payments for use of \nthe  road  are  only  collected  by  the  corridor  authority,  e.g.,  by  linking  this  activity  and  the \ninstitutional structure. Prepare draft Government regulations on decrees prohibiting the exaction \nof any payments from users by any other government agencies or authorities, and to empower \nonly the corridor authority with policing of the road. Draft the regulatory or legislative instruments \nnecessary for the toll collection and check their acceptability. \n \nc.  Financial Management \n \n20.  Recommend a financial management structure and accounting system for the corridor \nagency,  assuring  the  need  for  absolute  transparency  of  the  financial  management  of  the \ncorridor. The structure should address issues of financial management reporting (format, how \noften, and to whom): (i) annual auditing, by a registered auditor; (ii) management oversight by \nan independent board including public and private stakeholders (e.g., representatives of the \nMinistry of Finance, MOTC, local government, nongovernment organizations, bus and freight \noperators associations, user groups, the corridor regional executive management agency); and \n(iii) fiscal regime under which it will operate (e.g., value-added tax, corporation tax) \n \nE.  Counterpart Facilities \n \n21.  MOTC will b\u0435 responsible for providing counterpart support and facilities necessary for \n\u0422\u0410  implementation,  including  office  accommodations,  local  transportation  and  logistical \nservices, information, and materials necessary for the studies under the \u0422\u0410. \n \nF.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  HIV/AIDS1 has been growing rapidly in the Kyrgyz Republic from one case reported in \n1996 to 583 HIV/AIDS detected cases as of August 2004,2 with the highest incidences of 239 \ncases concentrated in Osh Oblast (including 2 AIDS cases in 2003 in Alai raion, which covers a \npart of the proposed road project area). The real number of cases of HIV infection is estimated \nto be at least 10 times higher and mostly among intravenous drug addicts. Also, due to its \ngeographic location, the Kyrgyz Republic is the country of origin and transit of potential victims \nof human trafficking, in particular in areas near the boundary and in remote southern areas. \nAbout 4,000 women annually were reported to become victims of human trafficking in 1999.3 \nThe Southern Transport Corridor Road Rehabilitation Project may have an impact on the spread \nof HIV/AIDS, STI (sexually transmitted infection), and human trafficking through a large number \nof workers employed during rehabilitation and the increased movement of traffic after project \ncompletion.4  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n2.  The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to reduce the risks of increasing HIV/AIDS, \nSTIs, and human trafficking that may be associated with the rehabilitation of the Osh-Sary Tash-\nIrkeshtam  road  and  operation  of  the  road  transport  corridor  after  project  completion.  The \npurpose of the TA is to raise public awareness and address the risk of HIV/AIDS and STIs \ntransmission  and  human  trafficking  among  construction  workers,  sex  workers,  local \ncommunities, truck drivers, border officers, and other road users. The TA will focus on capacity \nbuilding by utilizing international expertise in addressing HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking, \nconcentrating on HIV/AIDS through sexual transmission rather than injection drug use, which is \nthe main mode of HIV transmission in general, as road projects tend to be associated more with \nsexual transmission.5 \n \n3.  The  TA  will  build  on  the  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Government  and  other  agencies, \nparticularly  the  Global  Fund  for  the  Fight  against  HIV/AIDS,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, United States Agency for International Development, and World Bank, which are \nthe  major  actors  supporting  the  national  HIV/AIDS  control  program,  and  International \nOrganization for Migration, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and (United \nStates Agency for International Development funded) Winrock International as key contributors \nto the Government programs for human trafficking prevention.6 If an HIV/AIDS case is found \nunder the TA, the case will be linked with care and support programs provided by the Global \nFund, other agencies, and the Government. The TA will complement the national program by \nsupporting a risk zone approach.  \n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  According to Global Fund and National AIDS Center. \n3  Source: International Organization for Migration. \n4  Mobile populations are among the main transmitters of HIV/AIDS infection. Construction  workers, transport \nworkers, truck drivers, and traders compose key mobile groups.  \n5  According to an official of United Nations Development Fund for Women. Also, drug trafficking is addressed by the \nNational Drug Control Agency. \n6  This includes information and education campaigns, STI services, the condom use program, provision of voluntary \ncounseling and testing services, surveillance systems, training on law enforcement, establishment of check points \nat the borders, and regional cooperation on the fight against HIV/AIDS.  ", "Appendix 9  45\n \n4.  The TA comprises five components, to be undertaken primarily in the road project area: \npromotion  of  behavior  change,  clinical  support,  human  trafficking  prevention,  advocacy \nworkshops and policy development, and performance monitoring and evaluation systems in \nrehabilitation areas. \n \n5.  Promotion  of  Behavior  Change.  Intensive  health  education  campaigns  and  peer \neducation will be undertaken to promote behavior change among construction workers, sex \nworkers, and local people in the project area. Knowledge will be disseminated through posters, \npamphlets,  focus  groups,  and  launch  events  in  Kyrgyz,  Chinese,  Russian,  and  Uzbek \nlanguages during the rehabilitation of the project road. Peer education supporters such as \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be identified to facilitate education for sex workers. \nThe  TA  consultant  team  will  help  the  local  health  departments  and  the  construction  firm \norganize peer education through sensitization workshops, initial training, and regular monitoring \nvisits. Condoms will be made available free of charge to the construction workers, sex workers, \ncommunities, and border officers during the first year of rehabilitation of the project road. The \nTA will cover additional requirements of the mobile populations to augment condom distribution \nprograms of other agencies. \n \n6.  Clinical Support. The TA will conduct training for health workers on STIs management \nand voluntary counseling and testing services. STIs treatment packages and HIV testing kits will \nbe provided to clinics in the project area to help them meet incremental needs of the mobile \npopulations and will complement existing national activities supported by other agencies.  \n \n7.  Human Trafficking Prevention. Training in HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking will \nbe  provided  to  border  officers  in  the  Osh  region.  The  consultants  will  work  with  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  local  institutes,  and  NGOs  for  capacity  building.  Workshops  will  be \norganized  for  relevant  participants  to  discuss  activities  to  combat  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking, and establish a coordination network on human trafficking prevention.  \n \n8.  Advocacy Workshops and Policy Development. To improve understanding of the \nawareness  and  prevention  program  on  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  human  trafficking  among \nstakeholders,  advocacy  workshops  will  be  conducted,  including  information  and  education \ncampaigns.  The  workshops  will  target  local  governments  and  communities,  local  business \nowners, relevant NGOs, transport operators, media, local police, road construction companies, \nand the local units of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). The TA will also \nhelp developing HIV/AIDS and STIs policies for construction companies and transportation \ncompanies in the road project. \n \n9.  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  in  Rehabilitation  Areas. A performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system, including a project performance management system, will be \nset up to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the TA and to improve the TA performance. \nIn  addition  to  performance  indicators,  sexual  behavior;  treatment-seeking  behavior;  and \nincidences of HIV/AIDS, STIs, and human trafficking will be monitored. Surveys with local \nresidents and other stakeholders in the road project will be conducted to collect baseline data \nand assess progress. Training on monitoring and surveillance system will be provided. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n10.

Existing Traffic \n \n1.  The consultants for the regional technical assistance1 that prepared the Project analyzed \nexisting traffic, and prepared traffic forecasts for each section of the project road. Traffic counts \nby the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the 2001 European Union-TRACECA2 study \nof the road, and from the TRACECA database were used to determine appropriate base-year \ntraffic. \n \n2.  Average traffic volumes (in vehicles per day) on the project road sections in 2002 were \n641 vehicles per day on the Osh-Gulcha section, and 512 on the Gulcha-Sopu Korgon section. \nTrucks comprised 42% of traffic on the Osh-Gulcha section and 52% on the Gulcha-Sopu \nKorgon section. Cars comprised 56% and 47% of traffic on the Osh-Gulcha and Gulcha-Sopu \nKorgon sections, respectively. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n3.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type and type of traffic (normal, diverted, and generated) \nwere  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2005\u20132027.  The  forecasts  are  based  on \nexpected growth in gross domestic product, on income elasticities of demand for freight and \npassenger vehicles, and on expected future trade patterns. Gross domestic product is estimated \nto grow at annual rates of 4.5%. Income elasticities of demand of 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 are for \nnormal traffic, and used for cars, buses, and trucks, respectively. Elasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are \napplied to passenger and freight vehicles, respectively, for the remainder of the project period. \n \n4.  Based on forecast gross domestic product growth, income elasticities of demand, and \nexpected trade patterns over the total project period, average annual traffic growth rates for \nbuses, cars, and trucks are estimated at 6.3%, 5.4%, and 4.5% during 2005\u20132015, and 3.0% for \nall vehicles during the remainder of the project period. Volumes of traffic forecast on the project \nroad sections are summarized in Table A10.1.

General \n \n1.  The economic analysis was carried out for the project road, by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to receive only \nminimal maintenance and to continue to deteriorate. The with-project scenario includes routine \nand  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The  regional  technical \nassistance  (TA)  that  prepared  the  Project  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives, and the Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option. The \neconomic analysis covers 23 years (2005\u20132027), based on an implementation period of a little \nmore than 3 years. All benefits and costs are in constant 2004 prices. The economic prices are \nexpressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB.  Costs \n \n2.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and \nnontradable  portions.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  the  nontradable \nportion. To account of local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nC.  Benefits \n \n3.  The Project\u2019s primary economic benefits are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings for \nnormal traffic, generated domestic traffic, reduction of road closing times due to improved winter \nmaintenance, benefits from increased agricultural income, and border-crossing fees. Economic \nbenefits were calculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue \nprimarily  from  improvements  in  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and \nincreased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for five types of vehicles were \nestimated using the highway design and maintenance standards model, and are shown in Table \nA11.1. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 48% of total benefits accruing to the \nKyrgyz Republic and benefits from border-crossing fees account for about 41%. Generated \ntraffic is defined as new traffic induced from the reduction in transport costs arising from the \nProject. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. \n \nTable A11.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km) \n \n Item  Without Project  With Project  VOC Savings \n2-Axle Truck  144.7  125.3  19.4 \n3-Axle Truck  262.9  237.9  25.0 \n>3-Axle Truck  369.6  321.3  48.3 \nSmall Bus  134.5  115.5  19.0 \nCar  71.4  66.5  4.9 \n> =  more than, km = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost.   \nNote: VOCs are for the Osh-Gulcha road section in 2008. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "52 Appendix 11 \n4.  The Project includes procurement of maintenance equipment for the entire road from \nOsh  to  Irkeshtam,  and  the  associated  TA  will  assist  in  managing  maintenance  and  other \noperations on the road. Improved maintenance will result in a significant reduction in road \nclosures during winter. On the Osh-Sopu Korgon section, the road is expected to be open an \nadditional 4% of the year, which will result in additional traffic. Upon project completion, border-\ncrossing fees will be collected, replacing the fees charged for permits under the current system. \nThe fees paid by non-Kyrgyz residents represent benefits to the Kyrgyz Republic. Non-Kyrgyz \ntraffic is expected to comprise 50% of the vehicles crossing the border, and the fee anticipated \nto be $20 per crossing. The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. Benefits from \nincreased agricultural income arise from the higher prices that farmers will be able to obtain for \ntheir produce through improved access to markets. The Project will also have other benefits, \nsuch as time savings, improved road safety, and improved access to social services, which \nhave not been quantified. \n \n5.  The Project will also result in benefits to other countries from international generated and \ndiverted traffic, which are not included in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation \nas they don't accrue to the Kyrgyz Republic. International generated traffic comprises new traffic \narising from increased trade between the Kyrgyz Republic, the People's Republic of China \n(PRC), and Uzbekistan resulting from improvement of the project road, and to a lesser degree, \nnew international traffic to and from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Diverted traffic comprises traffic \ndiverted from two existing routes: Uzbekistan-Russian Federation and Uzbekistan-PRC. Traffic \non the Uzbekistan- Russian Federation route would divert to the PRC\u2019s sources of supply and \ndemand due to the much shorter distances once the project road is rehabilitated. Similarly, \nUzbekistan-PRC traffic now using the route through Kazakhstan would divert to the shorter \nroute using the project road. The present value of the benefits from international generated and \ndiverted traffic is estimated at $123 million. \n \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n6.

Sensitivity Analysis \n \n7.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis, shown \nin Table A11.3, indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 13% or total benefits \ndecrease by 11% for the EIRR to reach the cutoff level of 12%. The risks of the EIRR declining \nbelow 12% are mitigated by the uncomplicated nature of the rehabilitation works, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank's experience with similar projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and other Central \nAsian republics, and the conservative assumptions used in the analysis. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the EIRR meets or exceeds the cutoff level in all cases. Normal traffic would have to \ndecrease by 22% for the EIRR to drop to 12%.  \n \nTable A11.3: Sensitivity Analysis  \n \nSwitching \nEIRR  Value \n Item        (%)  ENPV  (%) \nBase case      13.3  3.035    \nOne-year implementation delay  12.6  1.383    \nBorder fees\u201410%    12.8  1.859     25 \nNormal traffic\u201410%    12.7  1.625     22 \nTotal benefit\u201410%    12.1  0.196     11 \nCapital costs plus 10%    12.3  0.626     13 \nNormal traffic\u201410%; capital costs plus 10%  11.7  (0.784)   \nWithout generated traffic  13.2  2.786    \nWithout winter maintenance benefits  13.1  2.493    \nWithout agricultural income  12.3  0.767    \nWithout cross-border fees  8.0  (8.731)   \nMaintenance at 50%     11.4  (1.134)    \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource:  Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.

The project benefits are distributed \namong five national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) \nvehicle owners, (iv) laborers, and (v) the economy/Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The \ngroups receiving the largest shares of the benefits are the economy/Government and freight \n ", "54 Appendix 11 \nusers. The large share accruing to the economy/Government arises from the benefits from the \nborder-crossing fees. The large share accruing to freight users is due to the large share of VOC \nsavings accounted for by trucks and the competitive nature of the Kyrgyz trucking industry, \nwhich makes it likely that the VOC savings will be passed on to users in the form of reduced \nfares.

Financial Benefits \n \n9.  Following  project  completion,  a  collection  system  for  border-crossing  fees  will  be \nimplemented and will replace the fees charged for permits under the current system. The \nGovernment has agreed that the fees will be set at a minimum of Som850 per vehicle crossing \n(about $20). The current fee for the permit is $70 for each round trip. The Government has also \nagreed that the revenue from the fees will be used to finance operation and maintenance of the \nOsh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam transport corridor and that any excess revenue will be used to finance \nmaintenance of other roads under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. \nEstimates of revenues from the border-crossing fees and corridor maintenance and operating \ncosts are shown in Table A11.5. The estimates are based on the minimum fee of Som850 per \ncrossing and the traffic forecast in Appendix 10. The operation and maintenance costs were \nprepared  under  the  TA  and  include  routine and  periodic  maintenance  costs  for  the  entire \ncorridor, not only the project sections. The estimates indicate that the fees will cover the corridor \ncosts and generate a substantial surplus ranging from $1.6 million to $6.0 million per year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11  55\nTable A11.5: Costs and Revenues for Transport Corridor Operations \n($ million) \n \n        Revenue from   \n        Border     \n  Maintenance  Operating  Total  Crossing    Surplus \nYear  Costs  Costs  Costs  Fees    Revenue \n2005             \n2006             \n2007             \n2008  0.21  0.20  0.41  3.97    3.56 \n2009  0.21  0.20  0.41  4.07    3.66 \n2010  0.24  0.20  0.44  4.18    3.74 \n2011  0.24  0.20  0.44  4.29    3.85 \n2012  0.93  0.20  1.12  4.40    3.28 \n2013  0.24  0.20  0.44  4.52    4.08 \n2014  1.49  0.20  1.69  4.64    2.96 \n2015  0.24  0.20  0.44  4.77    4.33 \n2016  0.24  0.20  0.44  4.89    4.45 \n2017  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.01    4.57 \n2018  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.14    4.70 \n2019  0.93  0.20  1.12  5.27    4.15 \n2020  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.40    4.97 \n2021  3.75  0.20  3.94  5.54    1.60 \n2022  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.68    5.24 \n2023  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.83    5.39 \n2024  0.24  0.20  0.44  5.98    5.54 \n2025  0.24  0.20  0.44  6.13    5.69 \n2026  0.93  0.20  1.12  6.28    5.16 \n2027  0.24  0.20  0.44  6.44    6.00 \nSource:  Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "56 Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  validate,  enhance,  and  summarize  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) focused on the proposed rehabilitation of selected sections of \nthe road from Osh to Irkeshtam in the southern Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project consists of rehabilitation of 124 kilometers (km) (Osh-Sopu Korgon) of the \n258 km existing road. The existing road consists of two traffic lanes and is paved with asphaltic \nconcrete for most of the length from Osh (0 km) to Sary Tash (km 185).The remaining 73 km \nfrom Sary Tash to Irkeshtam has only gravel surfacing. During rehabilitation, the construction \nprocess will take place almost entirely within the existing right-of-way, but will also include some \nflattening of cut slopes and minor widening of the roadway to extend horizontal sight distance. \nMeasures to control severe erosion, landslides, avalanches, and rockfalls will be a major cost of \nconstruction  requiring  the  use  of  gabions,  dumped  rock,  and  other  standard  engineering \npractices to provide slope stabilizations. In addition to new pavement, other work items are \nrepair of bridges and culverts; striping of pavement; provision of guardrails and signage; and \nrebuilding of longitudinal drainage channels. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked country located in the middle of Central Asia \nbordering the People's Republic of China (PRC) (858 km), Kazakhstan (105 km), Tajikistan (870 \nkm), and Uzbekistan (1,099 km). The total area of the country is 198,500 square kilometers \n(km2), of which waters count for less than 4% (7,200 km2). High snowcapped mountains, deep \ngorges,  and  fertile  valleys  are  the  principal  physical  characteristics  of  the  country.  The \nelevations range from less than 500 meters (m) in the Fergana Valley in the southeast, to 7,439 \nm in the northeast. Besides Lake Issyk-Kul, the second deepest mountain lake in the world, the \ncountry has very few natural lakes, but many artificial lakes and reservoirs originally constructed \nfor hydroelectric power or irrigation. In addition to big rivers, innumerable streams and creeks \nrun from the hills and mountains down to the valleys. The climate is continental, though quite \nvariable due to the extreme differences in altitude. The Osh to Irkeshtam road passes through \nthe  country\u2019s  two  climatic  zones.  From  Osh,  the  climate  is  arid  with  limited  and  discrete \n(irrigated) fertile areas. The area is classified as dry steppe. The route then climbs up and over \nthe Chygyrchyk Pass and down to Gulcha in temperate steppe country. The section of the route \nalong the Gulcha Valley reverts to dry steppe, and at Taldyk Pass becomes tundra, which \nremains the same through Sary Tash until close to the PRC border to a small pocket of dry \nsteppe. Precipitation in the different zones varies considerably. It is highest in the mountains \n(more than 1,000 millimeters(mm)/year) and lowest in the valleys (less than 230 mm/year in \nsome cases). \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Republic has many natural resources, for example, coal, peat, some rare \nmetals (including gold), and uranium. It has many mineral and thermal springs, some of them \nclose to the project road, but not close enough to be threatened by the rehabilitation works. \nMost of these resources, together with medicinal mud, are located in the eastern part of the \ncountry, especially around Lake Issyk-Kul, far from the project area. Forests cover only a minor \npart (3.9%) of the country. The area of forests has been reduced somewhat during the last 10 \nyears. Although trees are present along much of the length of the project road, only one area of ", "Appendix 12  57\nthe Forest Fund of Kyrgyz Republic (forest reserve) is actually traversed by the road. This area \nis located near the Taldyk Pass between Gulcha and Sary Tash (beyond the sections of the \nroad to be rehabilitated under the Project). But the road has no impact on the forest. The \ncountry\u2019s ecology is diverse in its relief, climatic conditions, flora, and fauna. Many animal and \nplant species are concentrated in relatively small areas and are therefore especially vulnerable. \nThe deserts, occupying less area than the steppes, feature different grasses and bushes, \nprincipally wormwood as the dominant vegetation, but the vegetation in the valleys and foothills \nis more diverse. The fauna of Kyrgyz Republic is relatively varied and nonhomogeneous in its \norigin.  The  known  species  of  vertebrates  include  more  than  40  kinds  of  fish,  3  kinds  of \namphibians, 28 reptiles, plus some 350 birds and 78 mammals. The animals of the deserts and \nsemideserts are limited in their composition of types, the result of the poor living conditions and \nthe small total areas involved. On the other hand, the steppes are rich in animals, both in \nnumber and species, as a result of the favorable living conditions. However, as the steppes \nhave been taken over for use as pastures and cultivation, major changes have occurred that \nhave adversely affected the animal habitats of the steppes. Considerable desertified areas have \nresulted from overpasturing and inappropriate farming methods.  \n \n5.  The project area also has diverse environmental characteristics. The initial point, at an \nelevation of 1,000 m above sea level, is outside Osh, a famed historical trading center close by \nthe Uzbekistan border, and which has now become the major city in the southern Kyrgyz \nRepublic, with a population of over 200,000. From Osh, the road follows a southerly direction \nalong the Taldyk River, through the easterly end of the fertile Fergana Valley, a quite heavily \npopulated area with well-established vegetation, before crossing Chygyrchyk Pass (elevation 2, \n408 m). The road then descends and connects with Gulcha (km 80), a town of approximately \n16,500 people, which serves as the administrative center of Alai raion. Due to the prevalent red \nclay and silt soils, the area of Chygyrchyk is prone to mudflows and slumps of the unstable \nslopes. Overgrazing of the sparse vegetation is a possible cause. After Gulcha, elevation 1,500 \nm, the road direction is southerly along the Gulcha River, ascending at a low grade toward Talyk \nPass. Sopu Korgon, the termination of the Project, lies before the Taldyk Pass. The Gulcha \nRiver is crossed several times, and the road passes through four small villages before arriving \nat the base of the ascent to Taldyk Pass (elevation 2,900 m). A series of switchbacks then lifts \nthe road up to the summit of the pass at elevation 3,615 m. Under future projects, major work \nwill be needed on this pass and its approaches to control erosion and provide protection against \nfrequent avalanches. The road continues southeasterly, and then employs serpentines to drop \n600 m in 10 km to Sary Tash (population 1, 590), located on a high mountain plateau with an \narid environment. At Sary Tash, a junction leads to the border with Tajikistan, and a vista of \nstark, alpine beauty in a pristine, practically uninhabited area, with almost no flora. The only \nhabitation is in the village of Nura with a population of 200. The grades are gentle until the final \n10 km, where severe hairpin bends bring the road down to the existing border customs facility at \nelevation 2,500 m. No alternative routings will be allowed to preserve the fragile environment. \n \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location \n \n6.  Rehabilitation activities will be confined to the existing right-of-way of the road. The \nProject will not have any negative environmental impact on archaeologically significant sites, \nnature  protection  areas,  or  other  culturally  important  sites  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  No \nsignificant changes of the hydrological characteristics of the project area are expected. The \naltered road embankment, borrow pits, and provisions for quarry operations, disposal sites, and \nminor  changes  in  delineation  to  improve  traffic  safety  will  not  require  permanent  land ", "58 Appendix 12 \nacquisition. In some of the road sections, landslides, rockslides, mudslides, flooding, or soil \nsubsidence  pose  risks.  Erosion  control  of  the  embankments,  pavements,  and  other  road \nstructures will be taken into account everywhere in the project area, in accordance with the \nquality standards for the design and construction of the rehabilitation works. \n \n7.  The project road crosses the State Forest Reserve Bel-Ulim at one point, between Sopu \nKorgon and Sary Tash, beyond the sections being rehabilitated under the Project. It is located in \nthe Osh lezhos of Alai raion of Osh Oblast. The mixed forest in the reserve includes the Tien \nShan spruce series (59.65 hectares [ha]); juniper (179.9 ha); birch (23.65 ha); and Siberian \nlarch (6 ha). The increased traffic resulting from the Project will not have any impact on the \nreserve. Furthermore, rehabilitation of this point of the road under future projects is not expected \nto have any significant impact on the reserve, as changes in the alignment are not anticipated. \nWhen final contract documents are completed, the local forestry official can make an accurate \ncount of any trees to be cut down. The number is anticipated to be very small. Improved access \nto the area will result in only minimal impacts. The only reported historic site is the birthplace of \nKurmanjan Datka, a famous female state official of the 19th century.  \n \n8.  Existing channels and culverts will be analyzed for size and condition, and if required, \nwill be repaired or replaced, to facilitate the passage of higher storm flows, thus reducing \nscouring and bank erosion in the vicinity of the road and ensuring the structural integrity of the \nroad. The project area has no ecologically important wetlands. The Project will have no impact \non groundwater resources. Construction supervision consultants will ensure that the contractor \ndoes not interfere with or obstruct any potable or irrigation water source. There will be little or no \nloss of habitat. Construction will take place within the existing right-of-way. Sites for contractor \nwork camps, batch plants, rock crushers, material storage, borrow pits and quarries will all be \napproved by the supervision consultants. There will be no interruptions of wildlife corridors, or \nhabitat fragmentations. No endangered species will be impacted by the Project. \n \n2.  Environmental Problems Related to Design \n \n9.  Environmental clearance will be obtained from the Ministry of Ecology and Emergency \nSituations (MEES), the central Government\u2019s environmental regulatory agency, prior to loan \neffectiveness. No significant negative environmental impacts related to the design are foreseen, \nas long as the asphalt plants, camps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, \nand national planning standards are appropriately followed. Special attention needs to be paid \nto the design of the infrastructure of the workers camps and to monitoring their water supply, \nwastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  and  overall  sanitary  conditions.  Where \nenvironmental impacts are expected, mitigation measures can be incorporated into the project \ndesign  documents.  The  largest  in  scope  and  the  most  costly  environmental  factor  to  be \nconfronted is erosion. Due to steep terrain, poor soils, and lack of vegetation to anchor the thin \nlayer of soil covering the rock, large-scale erosion is evident all along the road. The results are \nrockfalls, mudflows, hillside slumps, undermining of culverts and bridges, and wearing away of \nthe cross section at high fill areas. Mitigation measures proposed include stabilizing the slopes \nby a combination of gabions, dumped rock, and pitching. Gabions (rocks placed in a wire \ncontainer), will be used for erosion control, and as retaining walls against landslips. Dumped \nrock will be used to protect against erosion along embankment footings when there are no \nspace limitations. Dry stone pitching denotes the use of stone up to 300 mm diameter that is \nplaced without grout in a layer on a slope subject to erosion. This technique is especially \nbeneficial in erosion gullies, where the gully has been shaped to as flat a slope as possible. The \nuse of gabions and dry stone pitching are very labor intensive and will provide work for the local \ninhabitants. Effort will be made to limit earthworks, and thus to minimize the development of ", "Appendix 12  59\naesthetically unappealing spoil dumps resulting from cut sections. Moreover, judicious reuse of \naggregate screened from cut materials will be emphasized to limit the opening of quarries \n(borrow pits). \n \n3.  Environmental Problems Associated with Construction \n \n10.  Detailed requirements for upgrading erosion control will be included in construction \ncontracts. Embankment slopes will be planted with grass or otherwise protected after the works \nhave been completed. Newer technologies such as hydroseeding, geotextiles, and drain nets \ncan be used in locations where erosion and revegetation are difficult. Replanting work will be \ndone as soon as possible after borrow work is finished. Contracts will require that asphalt and \nhot-mix plants be located at least 500 m away from the nearest sensitive receptors, e.g., \nschools and hospitals. Asphalt will be purchased from permanent factories. Operators will be \nrequired to install noise and exhaust emission controls where applicable. Trucks carrying earth, \nsand, or similar construction materials or waste spoils will be covered to avoid dust and spills. \nCare will be taken during the construction period to ensure that traffic disruptions to road \ntransport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed in the detailed \ndesign and implementation planning of the rehabilitation works. In construction staging areas, \nequipment and vehicle fueling and maintenance may cause contamination of soil and surface \nwater unless controlled properly. Fuel storage and refilling areas will be at least 300 m from all \ncross-drainage structures and important water bodies, or as directed by the engineer. An oil \ninterceptor will be provided for washing down and refueling areas. Fuel will be stored in properly \nprotected  areas.  Construction  material  storage  areas  will  have  appropriate  rainfall  control \nmeasures. Disposal of solid wastes into water bodies will be strictly prohibited. Waste oils from \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, and solid waste with oil sludge will be collectively treated. \n \n11.  Construction camps will have septic tanks and controlled solid waste disposal pits, which \nshould  be  closed  within  a  specified  time  after  construction.  Sewage  and  garbage  from \nconstruction camps will be collectively treated or made into fertilizer. Storm-water retention \nbasins will be constructed to prevent pavement runoff from directly entering surface waters. \nBridges, culverts, and drainage ditches will be designed to prevent damage to local irrigation \nsystems.  Culverts  and  drains  will  be  cleared  frequently  to  maintain  storm-water  flow. \nContractors  will  be  required  to  provide  basic  emergency  health  facilities  for  construction \nworkers. Moreover, the contractor will be required to conduct a vigorous public health program \nto contain such contagious diseases as enteric dysentery,  malaria, and common  venereal \nmaladies. Frequent educational meetings will be held to inform the workers of the sources of \nthese diseases and to explain how they can be avoided. \n \n12.  To ensure contractors\u2019 compliance with the environmental regulations and standards, \nMEES  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  undertake  regular \ninspections. Their findings will be attached to the weekly and monthly progress reports, with \ncomments on the possible response to emerging environmental concerns. The inspections will \ncover all relevant issues, including the use of appropriate materials and possible claims made \nby the affected people. Continuous supervision of contractor work hours and practices will be \nrequired during the construction phase, when paving machines, rock crushers, and rollers will \nbe in operation. A few sensitive receptors (i.e., schools and public buildings) were noted, but \nthese structures were a minimum of 30 m from the roadway. During construction, these facilities \nwill undergo a temporary adverse impact due to the noise of the construction equipment. \nCooperation  between  the  contractor  and  the  local  residents  is  essential.  The  construction \nsurveillance  engineer  is  responsible  for  setting  up  meetings  between  these  parties  and \narranging such important matters as work schedules (hours of equipment operation, traffic lanes ", "60 Appendix 12 \nto be kept open, etc.); locations of work camps and material storage areas; and siting of rock \ncrushers and batch plants, in accordance with established policies of MOTC and incorporated \ninto the contract documents. \n \n4.  Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n \n13.  Road safety is expected to improve with the Project. Possible secondary benefits include \nreduction of car accidents and reduced spills of hazardous chemicals transported by trucks. \nDuring operations, contingency plans will be in place for cleaning up spills of oil, fuel, and toxic \nchemicals.  Maintenance  of  road  surfaces,  drainage  facilities,  and  landscaping  should  be \nenhanced to prevent soil erosion. No problem is anticipated with the expected increase of traffic \nafter  the  construction  is  completed.  Even  under  the  most  optimistic  scenario  of  increased \ncommercial traffic, the ambient noise level after the completion of construction (operational \nperiod) will not be of sufficient magnitude to require acoustical mitigation. The Osh to Irkeshtam \nroad does not pass through any compact towns, and no particular mitigation measures are \ntherefore needed at this stage for traffic safety and emission problems. Since better road \nconditions lead to increased speed, the fatality rate of livestock will rise. Together with increased \ntraffic volume, this issue is worthy of recognition. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n14.  Since independence, the Kyrgyz Republic has developed a framework of environmental \nlaws, regulations, and policies. These mandate that environmental impacts should be assessed; \nconsequences identified; ecological and economic studies carried out; and measures to mitigate \npossible negative impacts should be identified prior to the implementation of a project. MEES \n(formerly  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection)  is  the  final  authority  for  environmental \napproval. In the case of a road project, the contract documents are forwarded to MEES by \nMOTC after approval by the Forestry Department. The institutional capability of MOTC and its \nconsultants to prepare engineering designs and bid documents with substantial environmental \ncomponents has also developed. MOTC has several environmental responsibilities: \n \n  (i)  Assure, during the design phase, that all critical environmental conditions are \nacknowledged and mitigation measures are incorporated in the final design. \n \n  (ii)  Follow environmental guidelines in siting asphalt plants, contractor work camps, \nand open storage areas, during preconstruction meetings involving the contractor \nand representatives of MOTC, MEES, and the Forestry Department, Factors to \nbe considered involve electric power, water supply, sewerage, and disposal sites \nfor solid wastes. \n \n  (iii)  Monitor, during construction, in meetings between the contractor and the local \nofficials, agreements concerning permanent and temporary allocation of land \narea for road construction, quarries, spoil dumps, contractor's camps, batching \nplants, and other material processing locations. \n \n15.  Routine monitoring during construction involves continuous supervision of contractor \nwork hours and practices based on agreements between the contractor and local officials. The \npurposes of these agreements include limiting the time in which heavy construction equipment \ncan be used in noise-sensitive environments; and establishing sanitation standards for the work \ncamps. No formal long-term environmental monitoring is necessary following the construction of \nthe road. The formal acceptance of the works following the completion should include a full ", "Appendix 12  61\nexamination of the contractor's compliance with the specified requirements for the protection of \nthe environment. This should include verification of the proper cleanup and restoration of all \ntemporary  work  sites  (quarries,  camps,  etc.)  and  of  the  proper  landscaping,  planting,  and \ndraining of all borrow and spoil areas. In the longer term, the road authorities must monitor the \neffectiveness of the erosion and rock fall protection measures. Some form of reporting should \nbe implemented to ensure that information regarding defects in design or construction methods \nis fed back to MOTC. Periodic assessments should be conducted of the fatality rate of livestock \nand migratory herds due to traffic impact. Corrective measures (e.g., reduced speed zones) \nshould be taken if the frequency of such occurrences increases significantly. \n \n16.  The cost estimate for the recommended monitoring plan is $8,000 with one local monitor \nin a vehicle touring the road a total of three times. When the resident engineer tours the work \nsite for the final inspection, an environmental engineer could verify that the final clean up is \nsatisfactory on all quarries, contractor work camps, and spoil disposal areas. In addition, the \nenvironmental engineer could validate that culverts, drainage ditches, and surface watercourses \nhave not been blocked; side slopes are stable; and, wherever possible, removed trees have \nbeen replanted. Two more follow-up monitoring visits will be conducted at 3-month intervals. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n1.  Public Consultation  \n \n17.  A participatory social impact assessment has been made and is discussed in Appendix \n3. Widespread approval for the Project is reported. The residents believe they will get short-term \nbenefits  by  gaining  jobs  during  the  construction  phases,  then  long-term  benefits  through \nincreased access for their products to the markets. Some long-term service businesses with \nemployment  opportunities  are  expected,  including  new  roadside  cafes  and  gas \nstations/maintenance centers. The key concerns were requests for rehabilitation of local roads \nand potential employment opportunities generated. \n \nTable A12: Consultation with Stakeholders \n \nNumber of Local \n  Location of Village Date of \nPopulation Participants in \nVillage/Town  (km from Osh)  Consultation \nConsultation \nKara-Suu Raion         \n1.

The Project is classified as environment category B, and the 120-day public disclosure \nrule does not strictly apply. The IEE and summary IEE will be made available on request. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n19.  Environmental issues that need to be addressed during implementation of the Project \ninclude the following: \n \n  (i)  Erosion. To the extent possible, use gabions, dumped rock, and pitching to \nstabilize  slopes  and  limit  the  construction  of  heavy  reinforced  concrete  or \nmasonry retaining walls and buttresses. Although some slopes will be flattened \nand minimal widening of the road provided in hazardous areas, every effort will \nbe made to limit the work to the existing right-of-way. The goal is to reduce the \nvolumes of cut and fill, thus limiting the number and scope of unsightly spoil \ndumps and borrow pits. \n \n  (ii)  Air quality and noise pollution. During the construction phase, guidelines on \nwork  hours  should  be  imposed  on  the  contractor  to  limit  inconveniences  to \nresidents dwelling near the work sites.  \n \n  (iii)  MOTC will ensure that the contractor does not interfere with or obstruct any \npotable or irrigation water source, and that the contractor will site camps and \nindustrial areas to avoid existing habitats and wildlife corridors. \n \n  (iv)  Forests. Although the project road traverses the State Forest Reserve Bel-Ulim, \nthis section of the road is not included in the Project. The environmental impact \nwill only be minimal under future projects because the bulk of the work will be \nwithin the right-of-way lines. When final design documents are finished, the local \nforestry representative will be able to determine the exact number of trees to be \ncut; this is expected to be a very small number. \n \n  (v)  The  contractor's  responsibilities  for  the  essential  elements  of  stabilizing  the \nvegetation and replanting trees, as required, should be spelled out in the contract \nspecifications, including (i) final grading and revegetation will be completed as \nsoon as possible; (ii) trenching will be provided where necessary, to ensure \nsuccessful establishment of vegetation; (iii) seeding with a fast-growing crop and \na proven native seed mix will be required immediately after fill placement to \nprevent  scour  and  encourage  stabilization;  and  (iv)  grazing-resistant  plant \nspecies will be used to revegetate stabilizing slopes. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n20.  Based on the conclusion the IEE, the proposed rehabilitation of the Osh to Sopu Korgon \nsections of Osh to Irkeshtam road will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts \nprovided that the works are designed and executed in accordance with sound engineering \npractices,  and  that  the  recommended  mitigatory  and  precautionary  measures  are  fully \nimplemented.  Therefore,  no  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  needed  for  this \nProject.
