THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ncombined loan of up to $40,170,000, in aggregate, to four special purpose vehicles1 (SPVs) \nowned and controlled by Equis Energy for the Eastern Indonesia Renewable Energy Project \n(Phase 2) in Indonesia. The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund;2 and (ii) the proposed administration \nof a loan to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia II3 (CFPS \nII), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the loans. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n2.  This transaction follows phase 1 of the project where the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprovided financing to Equis Energy for a 72-megawatt (MW) wind power plant.4 Phase 2 consists \nof a 21 MW solar power plant in Likupang, North Sulawesi, and three 7 MW solar power plants in \nLombok, West Nusa Tenggara. These power plants will supply power to Perusahaan Listrik \nNegara (PLN), the national power utility. Delivery of the country\u2019s first utility-scale solar power \nprojects will demonstrate the viability of solar power projects by the private sector. The project will \nhelp  reduce  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  and  promote  renewable  energy \ndevelopment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, with gross domestic product of about \n$932.3 billion (current United States dollars) in 2016.5 The economy improved steadily after the \nAsian financial crisis in 1997, growing by an average of 5.3% during 2012\u20132016, down from 6.0% \nin 2012. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhancing \nthe competitiveness of Indonesia\u2019s power infrastructure, which has been struggling to keep up \nwith the country\u2019s strong economic performance. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n(MEMR) anticipates power demand to increase under current forecasts, resulting in a shortage \nthat could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable growth potential if not addressed adequately. \n \n4.  Indonesia has an abundance of renewable energy sources, with an estimated potential of \n29.5 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal energy resources (the largest in the world), 75.0 GW of \npotential hydro power, 532.6 GW of potential solar power, 32.6 GW of potential biomass and \nbiogas, and 113.5 GW of potential wind power.6 However, as of 2016, only 12.9 MW of solar \n                                                \n1  The four SPVs are all Indonesian limited liability companies: (i) PT Infrastruktur Terbarukan Adhiguna (Pringgabaya), \n(ii) PT Infrastruktur Terbarukan Buana (Selong), (iii) PT Infrastruktur Terbarukan Cemerlang (Sengkol), and (iv) PT \nInfrastruktur Terbarukan Lestari (Likupang). \n2  Financing partner: the Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n3  Financing partner: the Government of Canada.  \n4  ADB. 2017.

Jakarta. \n ", "2 \npower (less than 0.003% of the country\u2019s total potential) had been installed as on-grid power \ngeneration.7 \n \n5.  To cope with the predicted electricity shortages over the medium term, the Government \nof Indonesia introduced fast-track programs to accelerate the development of power generation. \nIn its national power development plans for 2015\u20132024, the government introduced a third fast-\ntrack program targeting the addition of 10\u201312 GW of power by 2019. In early 2017, pursuant to \nthe National Electricity Business Plan (RUPTL), 2017\u20132026, the government adjusted the target \ncompletion dates and capacities under this program to 29 GW by the end of 2019 and 35 GW by \nthe end of 2021.8 While the largest share of generated energy is still expected to come from fossil \nfuels such as coal, the government is encouraging the greater use of renewable energy sources \nin the generation mix. The government has set ambitious targets to increase the share of energy \nsupplied from renewable sources from 12% in 2013 to 23% in 2025.9 By 2025, the MEMR plans \nto increase the capacity of power generation connected to the grid through new and renewable \nenergy to 45.0 GW, about 6.4 GW of which will come from solar energy. \n \n6.  Simultaneously, the government aims to bring down the cost of electricity generation. The \nMEMR issued new regulations in January 2017 to set renewable energy tariffs against the local \nand national grid price, to regulate the procurement process, and more generally to reallocate \nsome risks under PPAs.10 PPAs for wind and solar projects signed after 2017 will be subject to a \ntariff cap. Tariffs will be capped at 85% of the cost of the grid in regions where regional grid costs \nare higher than the national average. In areas where the cost of the regional grid is lower than \nthat of the national grid, the tariff will be agreed with PLN by negotiation, although it is understood \nthat the national average is set as a cap. Against this backdrop, Equis Energy has asked ADB to \ncatalyze funding for the first utility-scale commercial solar projects in Indonesia. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n7.  The project involves the construction, operation, and maintenance of projects by Equis \nEnergy in Eastern Indonesia. The portfolio consists of (i) a 72 MW wind power plant in Jeneponto, \nSouth Sulawesi, which ADB financed as phase 1; (ii) a 21 MW solar power plant and associated \ninfrastructure in Likupang, North Sulawesi; and (iii) three 7 MW solar power plants and associated \ninfrastructure, in Pringgabaya, Selong, and Sengkol in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara. Phase 2 \ncomprises (ii) and (iii), totaling 42 MW. Equis Energy will develop and implement phase 2 under \nfour 20-year build\u2013own\u2013operate PPAs with PLN. \n \n8.  ADB approved phase 1 on 2 November 2017 and signed the financing documents in \nDecember 2017.  \n                                                \n3 August. Quoted in ADB. 2017.

The borrower of each phase 2 subproject will be an SPV owned by Redaya Energi Solar \nPrivate Limited, a subsidiary of Equis Energy. Based in Singapore, Equis Energy is one of Asia\u2019s \nlargest independent infrastructure private equity fund managers with a strong focus on developing \nrenewable energy. Since its inception in 2010, the group has developed and is operating 4.7 GW \nof solar, wind, and hydro power energy generation assets in Asia, and is the largest renewable \nenergy independent power producer in the region. Global Infrastructure Partners and its co-\ninvestors  acquired  Equis  Energy\u2019s  infrastructure  and  energy  assets  in  January  2018,  but \nmanagement of Equis Energy\u2019s projects in Indonesia will remain the same.11  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  ADB conducted integrity and enhanced tax integrity due diligence.12 ADB\u2019s review of the \nrelevant entities do not give ADB cause to believe that such entities have been established for, \nor are being used for, money laundering or terrorism financing in the jurisdiction involved in the \nproject, nor does it give ADB cause to believe that the transaction is being used for cross-border \ntax evasion.  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  Impacts. ADB financing will help the government achieve its sustainable development \ntargets through private sector investment in the energy sector. The government aims to increase \nthe share of renewable energy in the total primary energy supply to 23% by 2025.13 Overall, this \nwill support Indonesia\u2019s climate commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030 \nand promote more sustainable economic growth.14 Further, using sustainable electricity as a key \ndriver of increased economic activity will enhance quality of life in Indonesia. \n \n12.  Outcome. The outcome will be 61 gigawatt-hours of solar power contributed annually to \nsatisfy  increasing  electricity  demand.  Providing  this  solar  energy  will  avoid  carbon  dioxide \nemissions equivalent to 41,400 tons per year. \n \n13.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) 42 MW in solar power capacity installed and operated by \nthe private sector, (ii) local employment generated by the construction and operation of the solar \npower plants, (iii) local and national economic growth stimulated, and (iv) entrepreneurial capacity \nand skills of women in the local community improved. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports private \nsector infrastructure and environment, two of the five core pillars of ADB\u2019s long-term strategy as \nreaffirmed by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.15 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \n                                                \n11 Details of Client Information (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2003.

Consistency with sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which states that support for renewable energy projects will be prioritized \nand broadened.17 The project fully aligns with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy for Indonesia, which \nhas the following main pillars: (i) undertake sector policy reform to make access to energy more \nsustainable and inclusive; (ii) strengthen the reach, reliability, and efficiency of the nation\u2019s \nelectricity grid; and (iii) enable the greater use of clean energy. Further, the project complements \nADB  assistance  programs  to  the  MEMR  and  PLN  for  policy-based  lending  and  direct \ninvestments.18 The project benefits from ADB support to strengthen and expand the power \ndistribution network in eastern Indonesia, which is pilot testing smart grid projects in Sulawesi and \nNusa Tenggara to help PLN absorb more power from renewable sources.19 The project also \nfurther  broadens  the  exposure  of  PSOD to the Indonesian  energy  sector,  which  so far  is \nconcentrated in geothermal generation and gas-related infrastructure projects. \n \n16.  Lessons from previous operations. The project will benefit from ADB\u2019s exposure to \nIndonesia\u2019s energy sector and experience gained from structuring and implementing energy \nprojects  in  Indonesia.  ADB\u2019s  experience  indicates  that  successful  project  implementation \ndepends  on  the  sponsors\u2019  strength,  experience,  and  ability  to  understand  the  regulatory \nenvironment, as well as the terms and conditions governing the financing of such projects. \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  The ADB assistance will have three components: (i) a direct loan; (ii) a loan to be provided \nby the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund and administered by ADB; and (iii) a loan to be \nprovided by the Canadian Climate Fund for Private Sector in Asia II (CFPS II) and administered \nby ADB; for a combined total amount of $40,170,000. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n19.  ADB  adds  value  by  mobilizing  a  substantial  financing  package  to  a  project  being \ndeveloped by a leading regional private sector renewable energy developer which is entering a \nfrontier market by developing the first utility-scale solar projects by the private sector in the \ncountry. To date, only 12.9 MW of solar power plants provide electricity to PLN and there are no \nprivately owned solar power plants in Indonesia (footnote 6). Commercial electricity production \nbased on renewable energy has been struggling in Indonesia for decades, largely because of the \nabsence  of  a  transparent  regulatory  framework,  clear  support  mechanisms,  and  financial \n ", "6 \nincentives.  The  successful  financing  and  completion  of  this  project  will  have  a  positive \ndemonstration effect for the country\u2019s nascent renewable energy industry. \n \nThe project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to amortize its high up-front capital costs over a \nlonger period to reduce annual debt service and mitigate volatility from intermittent revenues, \nwhich is especially important in countries with few operational solar power plants and a lack of \nactual performance data. \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n20.  The project supports the government\u2019s objective of accelerating and expanding private \nsector investment in clean energy infrastructure in Indonesia. ADB is playing a catalytic role by \nmobilizing the CFPS II loan to build first-generation renewable energy projects in Indonesia. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n21.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for the environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. To meet the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for an environment category B \nproject, the SPVs have prepared environmental and social impact assessments for the solar \npower plants and the power transmission line and submitted these to ADB for review prior to \ndisclosure. Most project components, such as solar panels and transmission towers, will be \nsituated on rain-fed dry agricultural land historically planted with corn, cassava, and beans. None \nof  the  four  solar  power  plants  and  their  surrounding  areas  are  located  in  or  near  an \nenvironmentally sensitive area. Equis Energy designed the transmission line route to avoid \nsensitive areas and minimize disruption and inconvenience to the community. Equis Energy has \nidentified the project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts, and incorporated measures to \navoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for any adverse impacts in the safeguard reports and \nplans. Equis Energy\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate by ADB. The project\u2019s environmental impact and \nmitigation measures are discussed in detail in the safeguards and social dimensions summary.21 \n \n22.  The project will have a footprint of about 58 hectares (ha): 30 ha in Likupang, 11 ha in \nPringgabaya, 8 ha in Selong, and 9 ha in Sengkol. It is not situated in and does not overlap with \nany traditionally owned land or land with customary rights. To expedite the project, the SPVs \nprocured project land using a willing buyer, willing seller process without availing themselves of \nthe provisions of the National Land Agency Law No. 2/2012 on land procurement for development \nin the public interest. Land acquisition did not result in involuntary resettlement because of \nphysical or economic displacement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n                                                \n21 Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n23.  Measures to benefit women or facilitate their involvement in construction and operation of \nthe project have been incorporated in project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development (1998). The SPVs will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.22 The SPVs will report regularly to ADB on (i) their (and their contractors\u2019) compliance \nwith such laws; and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.23 The project is classified as \nhaving  some  gender  elements  and  will  target  employment  of  at  least  30  women  during \nconstruction and 10 during operation and support the development of entrepreneurial capacity \nand technical skills on renewable energy of women\u2019s groups in the project area. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n24.
