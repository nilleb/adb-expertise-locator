THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Leveraging Private Infrastructure Investment Project.   \n \n2.  The project involves a sovereign financial intermediary loan of $100 million to Indonesia, \nwhich will be relent to PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (Persero) (SMI), then on-lent to PT Indonesia \nInfrastructure Finance (IIF) for mobilizing private sector investment in infrastructure development. \nThe project will help close the infrastructure financing gap, raise the quality and standards of \ninfrastructure projects, and alleviate competing demands on fiscal resources.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Stable economic growth. Prudent macroeconomic management enabled Indonesia to \nweather the global financial crisis in 2008 as well as the sharp global commodities downturn in \n2015, while achieving an annual average economic growth rate of 5% over the last decade. \nIndonesia  has  achieved  measurable  improvements  in  reducing  poverty.  National  poverty \nincidence fell from 11% of the total population in 2014 to 9.4% in 2019. However, about 20.8% of \nthe total population (56 million people) are clustered marginally above the national poverty line. \nWith the country\u2019s output already close to its potential, any further increase in economic growth \nwill require structural economic transformation.  \n \n4.  Inadequate  quality  infrastructure  a  critical  constraint  to  inclusive  growth. \nIndonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  and  infrastructure  services  are  inadequate  to  support  a  modern, \ncompetitive middle-income economy and provide basic services to its people.1 Poor infrastructure \nconstrains connectivity in Indonesia\u2019s archipelagic geography. Indonesia\u2019s roads, ports, and \nairports are heavily congested. Logistics costs are high by middle-income country standards, \naffecting  trade  and  investment.  Inadequate  infrastructure  is  a  drag  on  Indonesia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. In the 2018 Global Competitiveness Index, Indonesia ranked 45th out of 140 \ncountries, but ranked 75th on the quality of roads and 87th on utility infrastructure.2 Estimates \nindicate  that  a  1%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  equivalent  of  permanent  increase  in \ninfrastructure investment in Indonesia would lead to a 2% increase in GDP in the medium and \nlonger term.3 \n \n5.  Infrastructure  development  a  key  government  priority.  The  government  has \nundertaken important institutional and regulatory reforms to facilitate infrastructure development. \nIn 2010, with the support of ADB and the World Bank, the government established IIF, SMI, and \nPT Penjaminan Infrastruktur Indonesia (Persero), who have emerged as major players in the \ninfrastructure landscape of Indonesia by providing debt financing, equity, guarantee as well as \nadvisory services.4 In 2014, the government established the Committee for Acceleration of Priority \nInfrastructure  Delivery  to  address  coordination  problems  leading  to  delays  in  rolling  out \n \n1  H.

Article IV Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n4 PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (Persero) is a state-owned enterprise that provides infrastructure project finance, \nadvisory services and project development support. PT Penjaminan Infrastruktur Indonesia (Persero) is a state-\nowned enterprise that provides government guarantees for infrastructure projects. \n \n ", "2 \ninfrastructure  projects.  In  2017,  the  government  established  the  Non-Government  Budget \nInvestment Financing Initiative at the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) to \npromote private and other non-budget investment in selected projects.5 The government plans to \nspend $450 billion in infrastructure development under the medium-term development plan, 2020-\n2024.6  \n \n6.  Leveraging  private  investment  essential  for  closing  the  financing  gap.  While \ncontinued improvements in public revenue and expenditure management will help create fiscal \nspace  for  infrastructure  and  other  priority  development  spending,  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation will be essential for delivering the infrastructure development plan while reducing the \nfiscal burden. In 2017, the annual infrastructure expenditure of about $30 billion was dwarfed by \nannual investment needs of more than $70 billion before adjusting for climate change.7 Moreover, \nprivate sector investments have the potential to enhance the quality of infrastructure through \nimproved efficiency as well as knowledge and technology transfer.  \n \n7.  Limited sources of long-term finance and project facilitation services. 8 With assets \nof about 117% of GDP, of which 74% are concentrated in the banking sector, Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsector is small compared to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comparators such as the \nPhilippines (193%), Viet Nam (215%), Thailand (359%) and Malaysia (385%). Project financing \nand more innovative structured products remain nascent. Legal lending limits applicable to single \nborrowers and borrower groups, and Basel III norms and asset-liability mismatch issues limit the \nscope of commercial banks\u2019 financing of infrastructure. With equity and local currency bond \nmarkets valued at approximately 51% and 19% respectively of GDP, Indonesia\u2019s capital market \nstruggles to provide the long-term debt and equity financing needed to support government\u2019s \nambitious infrastructure agenda. Unlike banks, institutional investors such as life insurance \ncompanies and pension funds are well suited to channel capital into infrastructure projects, \nbecause of the match between the long-term liabilities of such investors and the long-term nature \nof infrastructure investments. However, the institutional investor base is still relatively small in \nIndonesia, accounting for around 13% of GDP, and such investors tend to take a conservative \nand short-term approach to investments. Moreover, outside of liquid asset classes such as public \nequity and government bonds, participation of international institutional investors is limited due to \nthe lack of a market for currency and interest rate hedging instruments. \n \n8.  IIF can catalyze private sector participation. IIF was established by the Government of \nIndonesia  and  development  partners  including  ADB  to  provide  financing  solutions  and \ninstruments that are otherwise unavailable in the market.9 In April 2019, PT Pemeringkat Efek \nIndonesia (PEFINDO), a national credit rating agency, maintained its national long-term rating of \nIIF\u2019s bonds at AAA with a stable outlook based on IIF's strategic importance, public sector and \nsupranational ownership structure, and tight monitoring by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).10 IIF \nbonds  are  mostly  held  by  institutional  investors  (e.g.,  pension  funds,  mutual  funds,  and \ninsurance), which help channel long-term funds to infrastructure projects. IIF has an expanding \n \n5  These include 19 toll roads, 4 airports, 10 power projects, and one tourism project with a total value of $25.8 million. \nPINA (Center for Private Investment). http://pina.bappenas.go.id/. \n6  Government of Indonesia. 2019.

IIF partners with other banks and financial institutions through a syndication approach as \nprescribed by its investment limits. As of 2018, IIF leveraged Rp137 trillion of infrastructure \ninvestment from the domestic market through loan syndication and bonds issuance. When IIF \nplays the role of lead bank in the lending syndicate given its project structuring expertise, its \nparticipation adds an element of comfort to cofinanciers. In cases where IIF is not the lead bank, \nit undertakes an independent due diligence of the underlying risk and lenders agree on a common \nterm sheet. Where IIF provides mezzanine or equity investments, it takes the riskier leg of the \nfinancing equation, thereby catalyzing senior bank debt. The MOF has expanded IIF\u2019s investment \nmandate to include social infrastructure such as health and education. To support IIF's expansion \nin response to the growing infrastructure finance market, the government obtained $200 million \nin  additional  financing  from  the  World  Bank  and  requested  a  new  $100  million  financial \nintermediation loan from ADB. \n \n9.  Previous  ADB  assistance.  Since  2006,  ADB  has  continuously  supported  the \ndevelopment of the infrastructure finance market in Indonesia through policy-based loans, grants, \nand technical assistance. To help set up IIF, in 2009 ADB approved (i) a financial intermediation \nloan of $100 million to Indonesia, and (ii) an equity investment of up to $40 million (rupiah \nequivalent) in IIF\u2019s capital.11 ADB holds 19.99% of equity and has a representation in IIF\u2019s board \nof commissioners.12 The loan partially financed eight subprojects with an aggregate investment \ncost of $1.3 billion, implying a loan multiplier effect of 12.7 times. The ADB loan was rated highly \nrelevant and effective in achieving outcomes, efficient both in terms of utilizing the inputs to \nachieve the desired outcome and in terms of supporting the establishment of efficient processes \nand arrangements in IIF, and likely sustainable.13 The project was assessed as being overall \nsuccessful.14 \n \n10.  Lessons. The proposed project incorporates lessons from previous engagements with \nIIF, which include: (i) subproject eligibility criteria, focusing on long-term debt and excluding \nsubprojects  with  adverse  environmental  or  social  impacts;  (ii)  complementary  technical \nassistance  to  strengthen  IIF  and  SMI  capacity  in  areas  such  as  safeguards  and  credit \nenhancement products; (iii) submission of financial statements following ADB requirements; and, \n(iv) adequate coordination mechanisms between MOF, BAPPENAS, IIF, SMI, and ADB to \nproactively discuss project issues. The project also draws on lessons from similar financial \nintermediary loans, e.g., the ADB loan to the India Infrastructure Finance Company.15 The lessons \nhave  been  included  in  the  project  design,  which  include  quarterly  progress  monitoring, \n \n11 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n12 The conflict of interest that ADB\u2019s status as a shareholder and lender could give rise to is deemed manageable. ADB \ndoes not lend directly to IIF, although ADB and IIF will be parties to the same project agreement. ADB or its nominee \non the IIF\u2019s board of commissioners will comply with all applicable Indonesian law requirements in relation to conflict \nof interest. The current practice of ADB and its nominee in IIF is to abstain from decisions that include transactions \ninvolving ADB.  \n13 ADB. 2017.

Modality. Building on the experience of the previous ADB assistance (footnote 11), the \nfinancial intermediation loan modality is best suited for the project as it will ensure financing of \ninfrastructure projects through market-based allocation mechanisms as well as help strengthen \nthe capacity of participating financial intermediaries. IIF is a financially sound institution and meets \nADB\u2019s policy requirements for financial intermediation loans.16 As reported by the national credit \nrating agencies, IIF has a superior capacity to meet its long-term financial commitments relative \nto that of other Indonesian obligors.17  \n \n12.  Coordination  with  development  partners.  ADB,  jointly  with  bilateral  and  other \nmultilateral development financing institutions, played a critical role in the establishment and \noperation of IIF as an innovative financing mechanism to support infrastructure development in \nIndonesia.  ADB  coordinates  with  IIF\u2019s  other  shareholders  (SMI,  International  Finance \nCorporation, Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, and Sumitomo Mitsui \nBanking Corporation) and the World Bank (as lender to IIF) to maximize complementarity and \nsynergy in the respective support provided to IIF. \n \n13.  Alignment with ADB Strategy 2030 and country strategy. ADB\u2019s sovereign financing \nwill help address a key constraint posed by the lack of long-term funding sources and enable IIF \nto crowd-in private investments in infrastructure, while easing the fiscal burden. The project is \nconsistent with ADB Strategy 2030 priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequality through the creation of quality infrastructure.18 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u22122019 as well as the forthcoming country partnership \nstrategy  (2020\u22122024),  which  will  focus  on  the  acceleration  of  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  promotion  of  private  sector  participation.19  It  complements  ongoing  ADB \nactivities  in  support  of Indonesia\u2019s  efforts to strengthen  preparation  and  implementation  of \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  will  link  with  both  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  infrastructure \ndevelopment operations in Indonesia.20 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  availability  of  quality  infrastructure \nincreased. The project will have the following outcome: private investment in infrastructure \ncatalyzed.21 \n \n15.  Output:  Availability  of  long-term  financing  and  facilitation  services  for \ninfrastructure projects increased.

The ADB loan will be \nrelent by the MOF to SMI and then onlent to IIF to finance infrastructure projects. IIF will lend to \nsubprojects at commercial terms following IIF\u2019s operations manual and ADB\u2019s subproject and \nsubborrower selection criteria. Lending to additional infrastructure projects would offer IIF a \nplatform to expand its project facilitation services and products such as transaction advisory and \ncredit enhancement.   \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n16.  Building on the experience of the first ADB loan for IIF, the project will seek to add value \nby strengthening Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure finance market and boosting the capacity of two key \ninstitutional actors in the infrastructure financing landscape (SMI and IIF). ADB loan will help IIF \nexpand its lending operations and its ability to offer longer tenors on its loans, which in turn will fill \na critical market gap for infrastructure financing. An improvement from the previous ADB loan \nincludes the establishment of clearer subproject selection criteria to enable expansion of quality \ninfrastructure projects.22 ADB technical assistance will support IIF with the planned expansion of \ncredit enhancement products, undertaking financial and economic assessments of subprojects, \nand social and environment safeguards.23 ADB\u2019s financial support for the proposed project and \napplication of IIF\u2019s overall product lines and exposure limits are anticipated to generate the \nfinancial close of $1,536 million in terms of project costs. This means that every dollar of the ADB \nloan would leverage about $14.36 from the market. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The IIF has identified 12 potential infrastructure subprojects in the following sectors: \ntransportation, water, energy, telecommunication,  and health.24 The indicative list of subprojects \nwill be evaluated and screened based on IIF\u2019s operations manual and the project\u2019s subproject \nand subborrower selection criteria. The total investment for the subprojects is estimated at $1,536 \nmillion. ADB will finance $100 million of the estimated total investment. IIF is expected to mobilize \n$1,436 million from the domestic market through loan syndication and bond issuance.25 Table 1 \nsummarizes ADB\u2019s financing plan during the investment period. \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  100.0  100.0 \nTotal  100.0  100.0 \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.

Based on \nthe custom-tailored repayment method, the average maturity is 13 years, and no maturity \npremium is payable to ADB. The ADB loan may finance taxes and duties for subprojects. ADB \nloan proceeds will be relent in rupiah and US dollars by (i) MOF to SMI under a subsidiary loan \nagreement, and (ii) subsequently from SMI to IIF under a subordinated loan agreement. The MOF \nrelending charges are as follows: (i) in US dollars, the rate per annum is the rate in the loan \nagreement for the project plus 0.34%, and (ii) in rupiah, the rate per annum is similar to the rate \non 20-year government securities issued in the same year. \n \nE.

Subproject eligibility criteria. The eligibility requirement for subprojects are as follows:27 \n  \n(i)  each qualified subproject is financially viable (i.e., financial rate of return is higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital);  \n(ii)  each qualified subproject has environmental and social safeguard category B or \ncategory C under the environmental and social management system (ESMS); any \nqualified subproject with category A based on IIF\u2019s screening procedures for any \nof the safeguards will be excluded from financing;  \n(iii)  for qualified subprojects with likely category B impact, (a) ESMS is used to screen \nand categorize the potential impact; (b) relevant safeguard plans are prepared and \ndisclosed; and (c) the qualified enterprise commits to periodic monitoring and \nreview of such qualified subprojects and takes corrective actions as necessary;28 \nand,  \n \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Qualified subproject refers to a subproject that satisfies the subproject eligibility criteria. IIF will ensure that subproject \napproval procedure detailed in the project administration manual (footnote 25) will be followed.   \n28 Qualified enterprise refers to an enterprise that satisfies the subborrower eligibility criteria.   \n ", "7 \n(iv)  each  qualified  subproject  is  screened  in  accordance  with  IIF\u2019s  operational \nguidelines and screening procedures for legal, financial, and integrity risks, among \nothers. \n \n22.  Subproject  screening.  IIF  has  a  robust  and  well-established  subproject  screening \nmechanism. Due diligence covers legal, financial (e.g., sponsor financial performance and debt \nservice capacity), environmental, and social aspects, with special attention on risk assessment \nfocusing on commercial, reputational, regulatory and legal, compliance, macroeconomic, political, \ninsurance, and severity of audit-finding risks. Based on the feasibility and risk analyses, an \nassessment is conducted on whether any form of guarantee or collateral is needed to raise the \nsubproject\u2019s bankability. Site visits are conducted to verify the preliminary data and information \nreceived  from  the  potential  borrower.  IIF  will  ensure  that  subprojects  follow  the  approval \nprocedure detailed in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n \n23.  Subborrower eligibility criteria. The eligibility requirement for subborrowers are as \nfollows:  \n(i)  an incorporated entity engaged in infrastructure development with demonstrated \ncompetence to undertake the qualified subproject;  \n(ii)  a financially viable institution as demonstrated by, among others, its capacity to \nrepay the subloan and, where applicable, an average debt coverage ratio higher \nthan 1.1 times as determined in accordance with IIF\u2019s operations manual;  \n(iii)  not a related party of IIF or its senior management unless it is in accordance with \nIIF\u2019s related party transaction policy; and  \n(iv)  eligible under IIF\u2019s operational guidelines and screening procedures, including \nknow your customer requirements.  \n \n24.  Maximum subloan size. IIF can finance up to 40% of total project cost for direct lending \nfor subprojects above Rp3 trillion, 50% for subprojects above Rp500 billion to Rp3 trillion, or 80% \nfor subprojects below or equal to Rp500 billion. ADB will not stipulate any additional limitations on \nsubloan size. \n \n25.  Procurement. All goods and works to be financed under the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time)29 as \napplicable  to  a  financial  intermediary  loan,  and  detailed  arrangement  agreed  between  the \ngovernment and ADB. The ADB Procurement Guidelines relating to financial intermediary states \nthat where the financing provides funds to an intermediary institution, such as this project, to be \nonlent to beneficiaries such as private sector enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nor autonomous commercial enterprises in the public sector for the partial financing of subprojects, \nthe  procurement  is  usually  undertaken  by  the  respective  beneficiaries  in  accordance  with \nestablished private sector or commercial practices that are acceptable to ADB. IIF will follow its \noperations manual and procurement manual (2011) on the procurement of goods, works, and \nservices, which ADB assessed in September 2018 to be acceptable private sector practice. IIF \nwill also cause the subborrower to ensure that goods, works, and services to be financed under \nthe project be produced in and supplied from ADB member countries with due attention to \neligibility  requirements  for  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders. \n \n \n29 ADB. 2015. Procurement Guidelines. Manila. The concept paper of the proposed project was approved in February \n2017. \n ", "8 \n26.  Disbursement. IIF will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting \nsupporting  documents,  preparing  withdrawal  applications,  and  submitting  the  withdrawal \napplications to ADB (through SMI) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Financial  due  diligence  undertaken  during  project \npreparation determined that both SMI and IIF have significant financial management experience \nand capacity and will be able to ensure effective and appropriate project financial management, \nincluding to administer advance account and statement of expenditure procedures.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  The ADB loan is expected to catalyze investment of $1,436 million to finance about 14 \nsubprojects in sectors such as transportation, water, energy, telecommunication, health, and \neducation. The 2009 ADB loan (footnote 11) financed eight subprojects with positive economic \nimpact.30 The subprojects contributed to the much-needed expansion of the telecommunication \ntower network throughout the archipelago. For example, one subproject enabled the borrower to \nacquire 3,500 operating telecommunication towers, making it Indonesia\u2019s third-biggest tower \ncompany. The power generation subprojects have contributed to raising the population\u2019s access \nto electricity through the construction of new gas pipelines and provision of additional gas-based \nelectricity capacity.  \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The 2009 ADB financial intermediation loan of $100 million to Indonesia, which was relent \nto SMI and then onlent to IIF, was rated likely sustainable (footnotes 13 and 14). The project \ncompletion report highlighted that since its establishment, IIF has become a credible\u2014though still \nsmall\u2014player in the domestic infrastructure finance market because of its focus on project \nfinance, robust risk management framework, expertise in social and environment safeguards \nmanagement, and ability to provide long-term debt to infrastructure projects. More importantly, IIF \nhas proven its ability to raise (i) medium- and long-term rupiah funding domestically, and (ii) \nmedium-term funding from international lenders. IIF has also benefited from the capacity building \nsupport provided by its shareholders. For instance, the World Bank has been supporting IIF on \nsafeguards. Furthermore, IIF has benefited from its shareholder structure in terms of organization \nstructure, processes, and arrangements, as well as the quality of its operational policies.  \n \n29.  IIF and SMI are regulated by the Ministry of Finance Regulation no.100/PMK.010/2009 on \nInfrastructure Financial Institutions, which also requires IIF to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio not \nexceeding 10 to 1. Indonesia\u2019s Financial Services Authority (OJK) supervision team monitors IIF\u2019s \ncompliance with the MOF regulation. Under the project, IIF will maintain the following financial \nratios during its financial year and for each financial quarter following the borrower\u2019s applicable \nlaws and regulations and IIF\u2019s accounting practices: (i) capital adequacy ratio of 12%, which is \ncalculated as a percentage of IIF\u2019s total capital to its total risk-weighted assets, each as defined \nin IIF\u2019s operations manual; (ii) total long-term debt to total equity ratio of 10:1; and (iii) current ratio \nof 1.0 where the current ratio is calculated as current assets of IIF divided by its current liabilities. \nShould IIF fail to maintain any of the financial ratios, IIF and ADB will agree on an action plan \nwithin 90 days from the date of submission to ADB of the earlier of (i) the annual audited financial \n \n30 Economic internal rates of return on private sector infrastructure investments are difficult to quantify because \nprevailing private sector practices on due diligence do not include estimates of economic returns of subprojects. \nProject pre-feasibility studies often include a cost\u2212benefit analysis.  \n ", "9 \nreport, or (ii) the quarterly risk management report, which evidences the noncompliance, for IIF \nto implement measures to address its financial performance and maintain such ratios. Upon the \ndate of agreement, IIF will start implementing the action plan and complete implementation within \nthe timeline set out in the action plan. \n \n30.   In 2018, IIF\u2019s risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio was 35.1%, which is projected to be \ngradually reduced to 25.6% by 2023. The capital adequacy ratio of Indonesia\u2019s banking industry \naveraged 20% in the last five years. IIF\u2019s current ratio in 2018 was 1.27 times, which is projected \nto be 1.1 times by 2023. In 2018, long-term debt to total equity ratio stood at 3.15, which is \nexpected to be 4.0 in 2023. In 2017 and 2018, IIF recorded a net loss of Rp81.62 billion and \nRp42.95 billion, respectively, breaking with profitability trend of prior years. The loss in 2018 is \ndue to early repayment fee for two loans and loss on interest rate hedge. The 2017 loss was \npartially attributable to unrealized loss stemming from change in fair value of equity investment. \nIIF projects to gain profit in 2019 on the back of growth in loan commitments and disbursements \nin 2018. The projection of return to profit is supported by the 2019 first quarter data in which IIF \nrecorded profit.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial management. IIF complies with all prudential regulations and lender\u2019s financial \ncovenants as disclosed in its annual audited financial statements, and has adequate credit and \nrisk  management  policies,  operating  systems,  and  procedures  to  administer  the  proposed \nproject.31 IIF has adopted a two-tier decision-making oversight system with its board of directors \nand board of commissioners. IIF conducts operations in accordance with a comprehensive \noperations manual that was initially designed with support of the World Bank and ADB and then \napproved by IIF shareholders.32  IIF is relatively conservative in its investment decisions and has \na  tight  and  strict  lending  policy  that  has  been  implemented  since  its  inception,  adopting \ninternational  best  practices  from  its  shareholders\u2019  policies.  IIF  established  a  special  asset \nmanagement unit in 2016 to monitor and manage loans defined as problematic, including those \nnot yet in default but have shown deteriorating quality. IIF manages liquidity risk mainly by \nmonitoring position against limits, maintaining adequate reserve funds, and matching the maturity \nbetween financial assets and liabilities as far as practicable.  \n \n32.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  low  mainly  because  (i)  financial \nstatements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and \nfollow the OJK mandatory requirements as a public listed company in the Indonesia Stock \nExchange; (ii) the internal audit functions are guided by an operating manual, which has adequate \narrangements for a functional internal control; (iii) financial statements are audited regularly by an \nindependent auditor registered with OJK; and (iv) structure, qualifications, and capacity are \nadequate. No significant integrity risks were identified in the integrity due diligence carried out on \nIIF.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, SMI, and IIF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 26). \n \n \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Like all Indonesian limited liability companies, IIF\u2019s board of commissioners represents the shareholders, and the \nboard of directors is responsible for day-to-day operations. \n ", "10 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Infrastructure provides significant benefits for the poor, with a robust negative correlation \nbetween infrastructure availability and poverty in Indonesia. For example, when road quality in \nrural areas improves, household income is also seen to improve, and vice versa. Ensuring quality \nroads and public transport systems is important for women\u2019s access to jobs, markets, and other \nservices. To meet global commitments in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) \nframework on universal access to affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy services (SDG 7) and \nquality infrastructure to support economic development and equitable access for all (SDG 9), \ninvestments need to be scaled up. The channels through which poor and vulnerable people will \nbenefit from the project include improved access to social and economic services associated with \ninfrastructure investment.  \n \n35.  IIF will adopt the following gender-related design features: (i) assess internal mechanisms \nand capacities to promote greater visibility of gender and social inclusion considerations in the \ndesign  of  its  subprojects;  (ii)  ensure  that  recipient  subprojects  will  identify  and  maximize \nopportunities  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  employment  opportunities  during  construction, \noperation and maintenance of infrastructure, with potential adoption of evidence-based gender-\nrelated targets; (iii) promote adherence to national core labor standards and commitments to \ngender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  stated  in  the  government\u2019s  legislation  and \nregulations; and (iv) assess the social and gender impact of the project and the potential use of \nidentified women-friendly technologies for greater social and gender-related elements. Potential \nsubprojects to be financed by the ADB loan would promote women\u2019s empowerment through \nimproved access to health services, telecommunication, electricity and transport networks. This \nwould optimize the time women are able to spend engaging in productive activities.     \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The ADB loan will only finance category B and category C subprojects. IIF\u2019s operations \nmanual, environmental and social safeguard framework (ESSF), and social and environmental \nmanagement systems (SEMS), prepared with ADB, International Finance Corporation, and World \nBank assistance, align with the policies and guidelines of these institutions. IIF\u2019s ESSF is guided \nby eight principles: (i) social and environmental assessment and management system; (ii) labor \nand  working  conditions;  (iii) pollution  prevention  and  abatement  and  climate  change; \n(iv) community health, safety, and security; (v) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement; \n(vi) biodiversity conservation and natural resources management; (vii) indigenous people; and \n(viii) cultural property and heritage. Under the third principle, subprojects financed by IIF are \nrequired to address pollution prevention and management of impacts arising from subproject \nactivities, ensure conformity with global good practices and standards, promote more sustainable \nuse of resources, and ensure that climate change issues associated with subproject activities are \nassessed, mitigated, and monitored over the life of IIF\u2019s investment.     \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the  IIF\u2019s  ESSF,  SEMS,  and  operations  manual  pointed  to \nequivalence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), while noting minor differences in \nprocedural and administration processes.33 An ESMS for the proposed project has been prepared \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and IIF\u2019s SEMS and operations manual. The ESMS \ndescribes  the  safeguard  principles,  assessment  on  IIF\u2019s  SEMS,  operations  manual  and \nimplementation practices, identification on the gaps, and mitigation measures to be implemented \n \n33 Financial Intermediary: Environment and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nfor  the  subprojects.  The  ESMS  also  includes  procedures  for  screening  and  categorizing \nsubprojects and building capacity of IIF and its clients to manage safeguard monitoring and \nreporting. \n \n38.  IIF will screen and categorize subprojects for social and environmental safeguards using \nthe ESMS. IIF will provide categorization of impacts and risk to allow ADB to assess each \nsafeguard  adequately.  Subprojects  triggering  category  A  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  or  indigenous  people  safeguards  will  not  be  selected.  Subprojects  involving \nbusiness activities included in the prohibited investment activities list in the ESMS will not qualify \nfor ADB financing and applications involving such activities will be rejected. IIF will advise and \nprovide guidance to their clients on the types of social and environmental management plans that \nneed to be prepared, and consultation and disclosure requirements. \n \n39.  IIF can add value to the infrastructure financing market by raising standards based on \ninternational good practices. However, bridging the gap between international good practice on \nsafeguards (as reflected in IIF policies) and the prevailing national practices will require continued \nefforts  on  dialogue  with  stakeholders  and  strengthening  of  capacity  through  the  project \nimplementation chain. To address these gaps and through support from its shareholders, IIF has \ntaken measures including (i) substantially boosting the capacity of the social and environmental \nsafeguard unit at IIF, (ii) training on social and environment safeguards to IIF staff and clients, \nand (iii) public disclosure of project summary and documents.34 ADB will continue to coordinate \nwith IIF\u2019s shareholders and lenders who are supporting IIF on strengthening safeguard capacity, \nincluding on environment and climate-related issues.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  There are no substantial risks. Moderate risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35  IIF will employ its risk management \nplan to address project specific risks (para. 41). Furthermore, quarterly project progress review \nmeetings,  chaired  by  BAPPENAS  (para.  20),  will  provide  oversight  and  address  risks  to \nsubproject implementation. \n \n41.  IIF continuously monitors risks arising from its operations through its risk management \ndepartment. Quarterly risk management reports cover the analysis of (i) the investment and \ntreasury portfolios\u2019 development; (ii) credit risk (including social and environment risk); (iii) market \nrisk;  (iv)  liquidity  risk;  (v)  operational  risk;  (vi)  business,  reputation,  and  legal  risks; \n(vii) macroeconomic, political, regulatory, and strategic risks; (viii) information technology risks; \nand (ix) the severity of audit findings, and insurance and compliance risks. These reports are \nsubmitted to the board of director\u2019s risk management committee and board of commissioner\u2019s risk \noversight committee for consideration and guidance. If developments such as rating downgrade \nof sponsors or delay in implementation of safeguards action plan require proactive mitigation \nmeasures, IIF transfers them to the special asset management unit to administer such subprojects \nuntil they return to normal status. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n42.  The government, SMI, and IIF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \n \n34 IIF. 2019.
