By  providing  roads,  bridges,  and  associated  infrastructure  including  water  supply  and \nwastewater  and  storm  water  collection  systems;  river  rehabilitation  and  flood  control;  upgraded \ncommunity  facilities;  and  capacity  building,  the  project  will  contribute  to  urban  renewal  and \nsustainable development in Dongsun. 2\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2. \nBaise is in western GZAR and has an urban population of 260,000. Baise is one of the 14 \nkey national poverty areas in the PRC. Dongsun subdistrict is a peri-urban area 4 kilometers (km) \nwest  of  Baise\u2019s  urban  center. 3 The  Dongsun  subdistrict  industrial  area  was  developed  during \n1950\u20131960, when a number of state-owned enterprises built factories and housing for its workers \nin  the  southwest  of  Baise  along  the  Youjiang  River. 4\n During  1980\u20131990,  these  plants\u2019  low \nproduction efficiency became increasingly apparent as subsidies to state-owned enterprises were \nremoved  and  production  costs  were  brought  closer  to  market  norms.  Consequently,  facilities \nclosed, and others were sold or leased to private enterprises. Today, only the coal mine, fertilizer \nfactory, and motor plant continue to operate in Dongsun.  \n \nAfter  more  than  50  years  of  state-led  industrialization,  Dongsun  shoulders  heavy \n3. \nsocioeconomic  and  environmental  burdens.  Since  2008,  employment  has  shrunk  as  factories \nclosed  and  workers  were  laid  off  or  took  early  retirement  options.  Local  residents  are  highly \ndissatisfied with inadequate social services and infrastructure.5 First, current flood control capacity \nin  the  project  area  is  unable  to  protect  against  a flood that  occurs  once  in  50  years,  which  is  the \nstandard  requirement.  Second,  without  a  wastewater  collection  system,  factories  and  residential \nareas  discharge  untreated  wastewater  directly  into  the  Dongsun  stream,  which  flows  into  the \nYoujiang  river  and  thus  pollutes  Baise\u2019s  main  source  of  drinking  water.  Third,  the  existing  urban \nroad  network  in  Dongsun  is  inadequate  for  planned  population  growth,  the  resulting  increased \nactivity in residential and commercial areas, and proper links with other subdistricts.6 Fourth, solid \nwaste  transportation  capacity  must  urgently  be  increased  to  mitigate  the  environmental  pollution \ncurrently  caused  by  uncontrolled  solid  waste  dumping.  Further,  former  and  current  industrial \nfacilities have left Dongsun with localized moderate soil contamination. The detailed environmental \nsite  assessment 7undertaken  under  phase  1  of  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) \ndescribed the contamination and appropriate measures to clean it up.8\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA): ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Guangxi  Baise  Integrated  Urban  Environment \nRehabilitation  Project. Manila. \n\n3   Dongsun subdistrict covers 2.8 square kilometers. \n4  The industrial area included a coal mine, nitrogen fertilizer factory, motor plant, electrical power plant, and paper mill. \nFor  more  than  50  years,  these  industries  constituted,  along  with  government  administration,  much  of  the  urban \neconomy of Baise.  \n\n5  A  detailed  social  development  assessment  undertaken  by  the  China  Center  for  Urban  Development  highlighted  the \nchallenge to consolidate and improve fragmented social services in the project area through urban redevelopment.  \n6  Damaged pavement and poor alignment undermine road safety and push up road maintenance and vehicle operating \n\n   \n\ncosts. \n\n7  Y.Y.  Gong.,  L.  Jiang,  and  W.  H.  Zhang.  2011.  Guangxi  Baise  Integrated  Urban  Environment  Improvement\u2013Baise \nIndustrial Park Redevelopment Demo Project. Manila (final report submitted to ADB to assess the extent and location \n\n\f2 \n\n \n The Baise Municipal Government (BMG) is modernizing its industry and developing three \n4. \nnew  industrial  parks  with  higher  environmental  management  standards.  It  decided  to  close  down \nthe remaining industrial operations in Dongsun, relocate some factories to the new industrial parks, \nand  prioritize  urban  and  economic  regeneration  in  Dongsun.  The  Baise  City  Urban  Master  Plan, \n2010\u20132030  has  designated  Dongsun  as  a  residential  district  with  green  and  environmentally \nfriendly facilities. In 2011\u20132012, the BMG contracted Tongji University to prepare the Urban Design \nPlan and the Control Plan to establish the legal basis for improving Dongsun from 2013 to 2030.9 \nThe  plans  called  for  creating  a  mixed-use  community  with  residential,  commercial,  tourism,  and \nrecreational  areas.  The  population  at  completion  in  2030  is  projected  to  be  34,000. 10\n The \nidentification of polluted sites and the land-use plan recommended under phase 1 of the PPTA are \naccurately mapped in the Control Plan prepared by Tongji University. Sensitive land uses, such as \nfor schools and housing, were restricted to uncontaminated land. \n \n5. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  play  a  vital  role  in  redeveloping  Dongsun  by \nfinancing  trunk  infrastructure  improvements  and  rehabilitating  waterfronts  along  the  Dongsun \nstream  and  Youjiang  river.  With  all  major  arterial  roads  and  associated  water  and  wastewater \npiped  networks financed  under  the  project, the  urban  infrastructure  built  through  the  ADB  project \nwill  catalyze  private  investment  in  residential,  commercial,  and  mixed-used  development.  The \nproject fits well with recent objectives of the Government of the PRC to balance future urbanization \nwith  greater  attention  to  developing  small  and  medium-sized  cities.  ADB\u2019s  current  and  future \noperations focus on small and medium-sized cities in the central and western PRC.  \n \n6. \nThe  project  will  support  private  sector  participation  by  creating  additional  demand  for \nprivatized wastewater treatment services. The existing build-operate-transfer wastewater treatment \nplant in Baise will soon enter the second phase of capital investment. The 12,000 new customers \nin  Dongsun  that  the  project  will  connect  to  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  will  enhance  the \ncommercial viability of that investment.11\n  \n \n7. \nThe project is envisaged playing a demonstration role for other cities on how to regenerate \nstrategically  located  urban  land  now  burdened  with  outdated  and  uneconomic  industries.  Many \nsimilar  industrial  areas  developed  under  the  state-run  enterprise  industrial  model  during  1950\u2013\n1960 still exist in cities across the PRC. These areas are characterized by production inefficiency, \nenvironmental  degradation,  unhealthy  living  conditions,  and  inadequate  urban  infrastructure.  The \nmultisector integrated approach to urban redevelopment adopted by the project can be adopted by \nother local governments to transform environmentally degraded neighborhoods into livable mixed-\nuse residential areas. \n\n                                                \n\nof  contamination  at  industrial  sites,  which  called  for  further  site  investigation  and  the  dismantling  of  factories  and \ncleaning up of the sites). \n\n8  The  PPTA  was  implemented  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  assessed  industrial  pollution  to  facilitate  project  scoping  and \ndeveloped  environmental  management  guidelines  for  the  dismantling  and  cleaning  up  of  the  industrial  sites  in \nDongsun. Phase 2 was conventional PPTA to prepare the proposed project. \n\n9  The ADB-assisted Urban Knowledge Hub at Tongji University was launched in March 2010 and extended to November \n2017. Outputs include (i) innovative municipal and environmental infrastructure, especially solid waste and wastewater \nmanagement; (ii) regional planning, city cluster development, and economic corridors; (iii) climate change adaptation, \nenergy efficiency, and clean development mechanism; (iv) urban expansion and renewal; (v) urban transport; and (vi) \nlocal government and municipal infrastructure finance. \n\n10 The population figure is based on functional zoning assumptions about the intensity of development (the ratio of built \n\nspace to open space), plot coverage and building heights, the total built area, and average occupancy rates. \n\n11 Currently, there is no wastewater collection system in Dongsun. The project will construct a wastewater collection trunk \nline to take wastewater to the existing build-operate-transfer wastewater treatment plant in Baise  and this will sustain \nwater quality in the local river at Class III, in the PRC water quality standards (Class I to V , Class III is the minimum \nwater quality required for municipal water supply). \n\n \n\n\f \nFit  with  ADB  strategy.  The  project  supports  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive \n8. \neconomic  growth,  which  is  a  priority  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.12 It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015,  which  supports  the  government\u2019s  strategic  goal  of  building  an \neconomically developed society by helping to foster inclusive growth and promoting environmental \nsustainability.13 The project will remove infrastructure constraints, address environmental concerns, \npromote sustainable economic growth, and support community development in Dongsun and more \nbroadly in Baise. It conforms with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, \nand inclusive cities,14\n and is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which \npromotes  environment-friendly  and  resource-efficient  urban  development  and  supports  the \ndevelopment of the western region. At the local level, the project is consistent with Baise\u2019s National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  emphasizes \neconomic restructuring and urban development and upgrading. \n \n9. \nContinuity  of  development  initiatives  and  incorporated  lessons  from  GZAR.  Project \ndesign incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in GZAR and \nthe  PRC,  as  well  as  relevant  ADB  evaluation  reports. 15\n In  particular,  the  project  will  support \ncapacity development with a special focus on improving awareness of ADB policy and procedural \nrequirements  to  facilitate  a  smooth  start  to  implementation  and  compliance  with  safeguards \nrequirements, and on strengthening the long-term sustainability of facilities built under the project. \nin  project \nFurther, \nimplementation and enable future operation and maintenance (O&M) units. \n \n10. \nInnovative  features.  The  special  features  of  the  proposed  project  include  (i)  linkage \nbetween ADB\u2019s knowledge work and sovereign operations as the ADB-supported Tongji University \nKnowledge Hub was engaged by the BMG to prepare the Urban Design Plan and the Control Plan, \n(ii) a focus on redeveloping one geographical area of a city with a broad range of infrastructure and \nenvironmental  interventions,  and  (iii)  community  upgrading  and  development  to  enhance  social \nimpacts.  Basic  social  infrastructure  will  be  provided  to  meet  the  needs  of  local  residents.  At  the \nsame time, building the capacity of an existing rural community group and of the BMG will enable \neffective interaction between local residents and municipal authorities during resettlement, housing \ndelivery, and economic development. This feature will include (i) investment in social infrastructure \nsuch  as  a  community  center,  farmer\u2019s  market,  and  waste  transfer  station;  (ii)  community \ndevelopment  to  strengthen  the  ability  of  the  Dongsun  Subdistrict  Neighborhood  Committee  to \nrepresent the existing population, a mix of rural residents and state workers, while dealing with the \nBMG  during  redevelopment  on  issues  related  to  resettlement  housing  delivery,  local  economic \ndevelopment planning, and workforce training; and (iii) policy and regulatory development to help \nthe  BMG  develop  processes  and  institutional  mechanisms  that  integrate  public  participation  into \ncommunity development planning. \n \nB. \n\nthe  project  will  build \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nthe  agencies \n\ninvolved \n\nin \n\n11. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  the  development  of  Dongsun  subdistrict  of  Baise  into  an \nenvironment-friendly,  inclusive,  and  livable  urban  area.

Accordingly,  the  project  includes  integrated  components  or \noutputs  in  the form  of  urban  infrastructure  and  associated  \u201csoft-side\u201d  interventions. The  design  of \neach  component  supports  the  overarching  objectives  of  improving  the  environment  in  Dongsun \nand enabling the development of a safe, inclusive, and livable residential community. The project \nhas  four  outputs,  which  are  summarized  below  and  further  detailed  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM).16\n \n\n   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUrban  river  rehabilitation  and  flood  control.  The  provision  of  4.2  km  of  new \nembankment  along  the  left  bank  of  the  Youjiang  River  will  protect  Dongsun  from \nonce-in-50-years  flooding,  and  the  improvement  of  4.0  km  of  the  Dongsun  stream \nwill protect Dongsun from once-in-20-year flooding and  improve its flow capacity to \nprotect against urban waterlogging.  \nUrban  transport  and  associated  infrastructure.  The  construction  of  11.3  km  of \nroads,  including  four  bridges  across  the  Dongsun  stream,  10.2  km  of  integrated \nroadside  water  supply  pipeline,  9.85  km  of  storm  water  pipeline,  and  7.95  km  of \nwastewater  collection  pipelines,  and  of  two  bus  terminals,  will  improve  Dongsun\u2019s \nurban infrastructure. \nCommunity  upgrading  and  development.  Integrated  community  development \nplanning  will  include  (a)  the  construction  of  a  850  square  meter  (m2)  community \nservice  center, a  3,000 m2  market for  agricultural  trade,  and  a  solid  waste transfer \nstation with a handling capacity of 50 tons/day; (b) the strengthening of the Dongsun \nNeighborhood Committee;17\nCapacity  building  and  project  management.  Institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building \n ecological  restoration, \ncommunity  development,  the  dismantling  of  obsolete  industrial  facilities,  the \nassessment  and  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  and  project  management  will \ncontribute to the effective implementation of the project and the sustainable O&M of \nproject facilities. \n \n\n and (c) policy and regulatory development.  \n\nintegrated  urban  development,\n\nin \n\n18\n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $169.5 million (Table 1). \n\n13. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Activities in this component will ensure community representation in further urban and economic development planning \nregarding  issues  such  as  the  location  and  provision  of  basic  services,  access  to  training  and  employment \nopportunities, and community maintenance. \n\n18 An  integrated  feature  is  the  laying  of  water  supply  pipelines  and  wastewater  collection  trunk  lines  along  urban  road \n\nalignments. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAmounta \n\n44.85  \n91.21  \n2.41  \n1.65  \n140.12 \n25.27 \n4.11  \n169.50  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

Commitment charges for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan \namount. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n14. \nThe government has requested a loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years,19\n \nan  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized during the loan), and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan will cover civil works, equipment, project \nmanagement  consulting  services,  capacity  building,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation. \nThe  Baise  Development  and  Investment  Group  (BDIG),  BMG,  and  PRC  have  assured  ADB  that \ncounterpart  funding  will  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner,  including  any  additional  counterpart \nfunding required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns, including post-project recurrent funding. \nThe project financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in the PAM (footnote 16).  \n \n15. \nThe  PRC  is  the  borrower  of  the  loan.  The  PRC  will  make  the  loan  available  through  the \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Government (GZARG) to the BMG on the same terms and \nconditions as those for the ADB loan. As the end borrower, the BMG will assume foreign exchange \nand  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan.

The  project  will \nimprove transport, environmental, and social infrastructure in Dongsun through river rehabilitation \nand  flood  control  works,  the  construction  of  roads  and  associated  piped  infrastructure,  and  the \nprovision of social infrastructure. Net environmental benefits include mitigated flooding risk, better \nsolid waste management, and reduced pollution in surface waters. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nAll  project  components are  designed taking  into  account  local  circumstances,  topography, \nseismology, and climate, in accordance with the PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The \ndesigns  for  all  project  works  are  based  on  tested  and  proven  principles,  suitable  for  the  local \nclimate, and executable using local construction expertise. River rehabilitation will greatly improve \nthe  city\u2019s  resilience  under  climate  change,23\n while  significantly  enhancing  the  urban  environment. \nCapacity building to ensure the sustainability of O&M will be financed under the loan.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis. The economic analysis examined the economic viability of each type \n20. \nof project intervention and the viability of the project as a whole. Project interventions are expected \nto  generate  the  following  economic  benefits:  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii)  passenger \ntime savings; (iii) road safety benefits; (iv) road maintenance savings; (v) an improved environment \nbrought about by the restoration of the Youjiang river and Dongsun stream, as well as better flood \nprotection  for  households  in  the  project  area;  (vi)  higher  land  values  brought  about  by  riverbank \nstabilization, soil protection, and solid waste removal; and (vii) higher income brought about by (a) \nthe  increase  in  well-spaced  stalls  and  display  areas  in  the  new  market,  (b)  better  lighting  and \nventilation,  (c)  more  efficient  sewerage  and  solid  waste  disposal  systems,  (d)  greater  shopping \nconvenience,  (e)  wider  consumer  choice,  and  (f)  more  sanitary  market  conditions.  The  project \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.49% and is generally robust when subjected to \nstandard sensitivity analysis.  \n \n21. \nFinancial  sustainability  analysis.  Financial  sustainability  was  analyzed  to  assess  fiscal \nsustainability and the capacity of the BMG to repay the debt. The trends of economic growth and \ntotal  revenues  and  expenditures  were  analyzed.  Annual  funding  to  be  made  available  during \nimplementation  ranges  from  CNY51.19  million  in  2018  to  CNY172.21  million  in  2015,  for  an \naverage of CNY111.70 million over 5 years. Average annual counterpart funding equals 0.41% of \nprojected  revenues  during  implementation.  Annual  forecast  O&M  and  debt  service  is  0.21%  of \nprojected annual revenues in 2019, the first year of ADB loan repayment. The analysis concludes \nthat  the  financial  burden  imposed  by  the  project  is  relatively  small  and  that  counterpart  financing \nand  loan  repayments  can  be  covered  under  the  government  budget.  These  results  indicate \nacceptable fiscal risk, as it is expected that BMG financial revenues will grow in line with economic \ndevelopment.  Financial  analysis  of  the  water  and  wastewater  pipeline  installation  portion  of  the \nurban roadwork indicates that these revenue-generating subcomponents are financially viable. The \noverall financial internal rate of return is estimated at 5.70%, higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital estimated at 1.78% for wastewater handling and 1.82% for water supply. \n \n                                                \n22 Includes about 8,700 current residents and 25,300 new residents.  \n23 Water  level  calculations  required  for  the  design  of  river  embankments  and  the  revision  of  the  flood  emergency \n\npreparedness and response mechanism will consider the impacts of future climate change. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  with  the  GZARG \nand the municipal governments. Financial management assessment concluded that the BDIG and \nthe BPMO have general experience in managing foreign-financed projects, including ADB-financed \nprojects, but still require significant training and support on ADB policies and procedures, including \nprocurement, disbursement, and project management. The GZAR Provincial Finance Department, \nwhich  will  operate  and  administer  the  imprest  account,  has  extensive  experience  administering \nprojects financed by ADB and other foreign sources. It was agreed that the implementing agency \nwould  strengthen  its  financial  management  capability  to  manage  the  project  by  (i)  establishing \ninternal  audit  arrangements,  (ii)  undertaking  training  on  ADB  policy  and  procedural  requirements, \nand  (iii)  seeking  external  financial  management  assistance  as  needed.  The  project\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  risk  rating  is  low  to  medium  after  considering  mitigation.  The  identified  financial \nmanagement risks will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  is  expected  to  create  positive  social  benefits  through  improvements  to  the \n23. \nurban  environment,  infrastructure,  and  living  conditions  in  Dongsun,  which  has  a  rural  poverty \nincidence  of  9.8%  and  an  urban  poverty  incidence  of  3.8%.  The  existing  resident  population  is \n8,694, and the future resident population is expected to be 34,000.24\n The projected 75,000 indirect \nbeneficiaries  include  residents  of  other  subdistricts  of  Baise  who  will  use  the  space  and  facilities \ndeveloped  in  Dongsun.  The  project  will  directly  create  1,455  jobs,  1,000  of  them  during \nconstruction  and  455  during  operation;  15,400  jobs  through  the  development  of  local  real  estate; \nand  16,490  long-term  opportunities  in  commercial  services,  business  offices,  hotels,  and \ncommunity  employment.  To  reinforce  the  positive  benefits  of  improved  transport,  solid  waste \ncollection,  and  river  rehabilitation,  the  BMG  and  Youjiang  District  Government  will  conduct  public \nprograms  on  road  safety,  public  sanitation,  and  environmental  awareness  during  project \nimplementation.  The  component  on  community  upgrading  and  development  will  (i)  provide  social \ninfrastructure  to  residents,  (ii)  foster  the  development  of  a  community  organization  to  represent \nresidents during the transition to a new community and help define future economic development \nand  public  participation,  and  (iii)  support  the  BMG  in  creating  best  practice  policies  to  address \nsocial risks in new area development. The social action plan will be supervised and monitored by a \nsocial development specialist under project management consulting services.   \n \n24. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \ngender analysis found that women support the project and anticipate benefits in mobility, access, \nsafety  and  security,  employment,  an  improved  living  environment,  and  more  effective  public \nparticipation  and  representation  in  local  development  planning.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been \nprepared  to  (i)  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  activities;  (ii)  provide  gender-sensitivity \ntraining  to  BDIG  and  BPMO  staff;  (iii)  ensure  that  project  decision-making  bodies  and  capacity-\nbuilding  activities  are  gender  balanced;  and  (iv)  include  gender  targets,  indicators,  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  data for  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. The  project  will  (i)  protect  public  health \nthrough solid waste management; (ii) improve access, safety, and mobility for women by ensuring \npedestrian access and public transport within the new area and connecting to Baise city center; (iii) \nimprove  traffic  safety;  (iv)  increase  job  opportunities  for  women;  and  (v)  encourage  women  to \nparticipate in community development institutions. \n \n\n                                                \n24  Based  on  the  estimate  of  Baise\u2019s  future  population  in  Guangxi  Baise  Dongsun  Subdistrict  Integrated  Urban \n\nEnvironment Improvement Project Planning Study. \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  classified category  B for  environment.  An  initial  environmental  examination, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  complying  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website in June 2013. The project will \nnot result in significant environment impacts. Environmental management measures defined in the \nEMP  will  contain  the  impacts  to  acceptable  levels. While  the  project  will  not  intrude  on  industrial \nsites,  the  BMG  will  be  provided  with  capacity  building  in  brownfield  management  to  ensure  that \nfuture site clean-up and redevelopment follow international best practice25\n and comply with national \nlegislation.  The  BMG  disclosed  environment  information  to  potentially  affected  people.  Any \nenvironmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  grievance-redress \nmechanism developed for the project.  \n \nThe project is classified category A for resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples. \n26. \nThe  BMG  has  prepared  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (REMDP)  to  cover \nland acquisition, resettlement, and indigenous peoples issues. The preliminary impact survey found \nthat  the  project  will  adversely  affect  residents,  enterprises,  and  stores.26 A  total  of  759.01 mu27 of \nland  will  be  occupied  permanently,  including  547.34 mu  of  village  collective  land  in  Dongsun  and \n211.67 mu of state-owned land. The acquisition of village collective land will adversely affect  246 \nfarm  households  with  854  members;  151  rural  households  with  511  members  and  214  urban \nhouseholds  with  673  members  will  lose  their  homes.  Also,  8  enterprises  with  174  operators  and \nemployees  and  15  stores  with  45  operators  and  employees  will  be  affected.  The  project  will \npermanently  affect  570  households  with  2,035  members,  and  65  households  with  258  members \nwill  suffer  temporary  impacts,  for  a  total  of  635  households  with  2,293  members.28 The  REMDP \nwas  endorsed  by  the  BMG  and  disclosed  to  affected  people  through  the  distribution  of  REMDP \ninformation booklets published in Mandarin. Copies of the REMDP were provided to relevant local \noffices, made accessible to the affected people, and uploaded to the ADB website in June 2013.29\n \nThe  implementation  of  the  REMDP  will  be  monitored  by  the  BMG  internally  through  semiannual \nprogress reports. The BPMO will engage an external monitor, who will also provide monitoring and \nevaluation reports semiannually.  \n \n27. \nThe REMDP defines the measures to mitigate the negative impacts of resettlement on the \nlocal ethnic minority population. The Zhuang ethnic minority is the majority in GZAR and Baise. In \nthe total population of Dongsun, 39% are Zhuang. The proportion of ethnic minorities among urban \nresidents  of  Dongsun  is,  at  29%,  lower  than  among  rural  residents  (83%)  because  many  former \nenterprise employees are Han from other parts of the PRC. In the Baise urban area, the Zhuang \npeople  live  harmoniously  with  the  Han,  and  most  are  bilingual  in  Zhuang  and  Mandarin.  The \nZhuang  in  Dongsun  are  distinct  from  mainstream  society  with  respect  to  their  customary  cultural \nand  social  institutions.  Consultation  with  Zhuang  people  in  communities  in  the  project  area \nrevealed that the negative impacts on ethnic minorities are resettlement and the future loss of their \nfarmland to urbanization. The monitoring of the REMDP and of social and gender dimensions will \ninclude analysis by ethnicity.  \n \n\n                                                \n25 ASTM International. 2005.

They are \n\nonly counted once.  \n\n29 ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  adjusted  the  terminology  for  involuntary  resettlement,  changing  \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons,\" who were defined as persons physically and/or economically displaced by involuntary \nacquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated parks and protected areas. \nAlthough resettlement plans for ADB projects in the PRC maintain the original terminology of \u201caffected persons,\u201d this is \nequivalent to the new Safeguard Policy Statement definition of \u201cdisplaced persons.\u201d \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.
