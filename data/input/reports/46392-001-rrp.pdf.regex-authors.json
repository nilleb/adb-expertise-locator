I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant  and  administration  of  such  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF), both to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the \nNorth\u2013South Power Transmission Enhancement Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  construct  a  500-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  about  225 \nkilometers long across the Hindukush mountain range between the northern town of Dashte \nAlwan and Kabul at the southern end. It will include a new 500-kV/220-kV substation to connect \nto the grid in Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital.2 The project will be complemented by a second Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) power project under the proposed tranche 5 of ADB\u2019s Energy Sector \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 2) to build a 500-kV substation to connect to the \ngrid at the northern end of the line in Dashte Alwan. Tranche 5 is expected to be endorsed by \nADB  Management  soon  after  the  ADB  Board  consideration  of  the  North\u2013South  Power \nTransmission Enhancement Project. After domestic generation projects planned in northern \nAfghanistan are implemented and proposed arrangements for greater power imports from the \ncountry\u2019s northern neighbors are put in place, the projects would transmit the additional power \nfrom these sources to the south and allow for the export of power in excess of Afghanistan\u2019s \ndomestic needs to Pakistan over a planned connection between the country\u2019s two grids. The \nline will also allow Afghanistan to facilitate power export to Tajikistan during winter.  \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Afghanistan is a net energy importer. Power demand in major load centers is growing at \n25% per year. While indigenous renewable energy and fossil fuels resources exist, these need \nto be developed. During 2012, peak demand in Afghanistan stood at 670 MW, of which 500 MW \nwas met through imports. With the three times increase in electrification rate anticipated by \n2032,  peak  demand  will  reach  3,500  MW  with  an  annual  power  consumption  of  18,400 \ngigawatt-hours.  Meeting  this  demand  requires  development  of  all  viable  import  and  local \ngeneration options. The project will connect northern indigenous generation and imported power \nsupply sources to the eastern and southern load centers in Afghanistan. \n \n4.  The  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  has  made  significant  progress  in  addressing  its \ntechnical,  fiscal,  and  governance  challenges  since  2001.  The  proportion  of  the  population \nconnected to the power grid increased from a mere 5% in 2002 to about 25% in 2012. System \nlosses (technical and commercial) dropped during the same period from more than 70% to 42%, \nand collection rates rose from less than 50% to more than 90%. Revenues have increased by \n15%  every  quarter  since  2009.  An  autonomous,  corporate  state-owned  power  utility\u2014Da \nAfghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS)\u2014has been established and is gaining ground. Currently, \n73% of Afghanistan\u2019s power supplies are being imported\u201422% from Iran, 4% from Tajikistan, \n17% from Turkmenistan, and 57% from Uzbekistan. Import tariffs ranging from $0.020 to $0.065 \nper kilowatt-hour are subsidized by the exporting countries.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project, including 10 other investment projects, was prepared under a subcomponent of ADB. 2008. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility and \nAdministration of Grant Energy Sector Development Investment Program. Manila (MFF 0026-AFG, $570 million, \napproved on 2 December). ", "2 \n5.  Afghanistan currently has 10 isolated power grid islands that are fed by different power \nsystems through 220-kV and 110-kV links. This split creates system inefficiencies, increases \noperational  cost,  and  reduces  reliability  of  power  supply.    An  ADB-supported  government \nstrategic power master plan for 2012\u20132032 calls for the connection of these separate network \nsegments via a ring structure of 500-kV transmission lines and the expansion of distribution \nnetworks across urban and rural load centers.3 \n \n6.   Kabul and provincial capitals in all eastern and southern provinces experience load-\nshedding due to a power shortage. A key challenge is to strengthen infrastructure capacity \nneeded to transmit power to Afghanistan\u2019s eastern and southern provinces, including Kabul. \nThe power imports are expected to grow from 300 MW in 2012 to 600 MW by 2018.4  Currently \nthe only transmission link connecting northern Afghanistan to the south is a 220-kV transmission \nline with a capacity of 300 MW. This limits the supply of power in the areas south of the \nHindukush mountain range. This in turn constrains economic growth and opportunities in the \nsouth; creates disparities in the country\u2019s economic development; and fuels ethnic and regional \ntensions, insecurity, and discontent.  \n \n7.  The transmission line and substation to be provided under the project, combined with the \nsubstation needed to complete the system to be financed under tranche 5 of the Energy Sector \nDevelopment Investment Program, will be central to the envisaged regional power trade and \nAfghanistan\u2019s important future role in it as an energy resource corridor connecting Central Asia\u2019s \npower systems with its own and those of South Asia. A proposed Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013\nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  (TUTAP)  power  transmission  interconnection  would  boost \nregional cooperation and integration through this energy trade by enabling exporting countries \nto make profitable use of their surplus resources and importing countries to effectively meet \ntheir energy needs at cost.5 \n \n8.  The project is identified in the power master plan and in the Afghanistan National Energy \nSupply Program as the link most needed to meet the country\u2019s future power needs. The project \nis connected to upstream power generation and power transmission and downstream power \ntransmission and distribution projects. The power link between Central Asia and South Asia is a \nstrategic objective of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program countries and is \nincluded in the program\u2019s Strategy 2020 and energy work plan, 2013\u20132015. The project is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u201320136 and country operations business \nplan, 2013\u20132014 for Afghanistan.7 \n \n9.  DABS has been undertaking a comprehensive program since 2008 to import power, \ndevelop domestic generation, and expand its grids to close a gap between demand for power \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010.

Manila (TA 7637-AFG, $1.5 \nmillion, approved on 6 November). \n4  The 220-kV import lines from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are operational and were financed by ADB under the \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  and  the  Regional  Power  Transmission \nInterconnection Project. Under the power purchase and sales agreement, power imports from Tajikistan are up to \n300 MW during March\u2013October each year and are up to as 300 MW all year round from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan is \ncurrently importing 50 MW of power from Turkmenistan. The new 500-kV transmission line from Turkmenistan, to \ninterconnect power grids of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, will be completed by 2018 and will import up to 300 \nMW of power from Turkmenistan.  \n5 TUTAP is a regional power project under Central Asia South Asia Regional Electricity Markets framework. \n6 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nand supply.8  Afghanistan\u2019s National Energy Supply Program is based on plans to combine the \ndevelopment of domestic power generation from domestic fossil fuel and renewable energy with \nan increase in power imports.9 In addition to meeting its domestic needs on time and in a cost-\neffective  manner  through  diversified  imports,  Afghanistan  also  plans  to  develop  a  transit \ntransmission  system  through  the  country  to  move  power  from  energy-rich  Central  Asian \ncountries to consumers in energy-scarce South Asia. \n  \n10.  The government has developed the country\u2019s power sector strategy, road map, policy \nframework, and envisaged investment plan in line with the power sector master plan 2012\u20132032. \nThe power master plan builds upon the Afghanistan National Development Strategy crafted in \n2008. The power sector in Afghanistan has made substantial progress in meeting strategic \nobjectives and road map milestones set out in 2008, including (i) greater efficiency from existing \noperations (rehabilitation of hydropower plants and transmission and distribution networks); (ii) \nimprovement in sector governance (formulation of an electricity law, renewable energy policy, \nand creation of an autonomous power utility); (iii) promotion of rural electrification (development \nof off-grid solutions and strengthening on-grid networks); and (iv) investments in new capacity \n(development  of  additional  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  systems).  Lessons \nincorporated from ADB\u2019s ongoing investments in Afghanistan\u2019s energy sector include the need \nto (i) build security provisions into project design and financing, (ii) simplify procurement and \nimplementation through use of turnkey contracting as the default choice, (iii) improve project \nreadiness through advance actions, and (iv) provide capacity support to DABS.   \n11.  DABS has institutionalized operations and maintenance (O&M) protocols and systems. \nAn O&M unit under the operations department has been established and strengthened, with \nadequate budgetary resources allocated from utility\u2019s internal revenues. ADB, the World Bank, \nand the United States Agency for International Development are providing capacity support \nthrough training programs. In total, nearly $45 million of O&M capacity support programs are \ncurrently being implemented.  \n12.  Since  2010,  the  ADB-financed  program  management  and  project  implementation \nconsultants  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility  (footnote  2)  have  been \nproviding  on-the-job  training  to  DABS  personnel  in  technical,  financial  management, \nprocurement, and social safeguards areas. In parallel, the Government of the United States is \nimplementing  $200  million  in  capacity  support  programs  to  strengthen  DABS\u2019  capacity  in \ntechnical, governance, financial management, and planning functions. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be increased power trade between Afghanistan and its neighbors, and a \nhigher rate of electrification within the country. The outcome of the project will be an increased \nsupply of power from the north of Afghanistan to its southern and eastern regions.  \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The output will be a 500-kV transmission line constructed from Dashte Alwan to Kabul \nand a 500-kV/220-kV substation built at Arghundy in Kabul.  \n                                                \n8 The program includes rehabilitation and construction of new hydropower plants in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern and \nsouthern provinces, gas-powered thermal plants in northern provinces, and diesel-generated plants in major load \ncenters across Afghanistan. \n9  The National Energy Supply Program is one of 24 national priority programs that have been jointly endorsed by the \nGovernment of Afghanistan and the country\u2019s international development partners. \n ", "4 \n15.  The project will add up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) to the existing 300 MW of transmission \ncapacity  between  northern  and  southern  Afghanistan.  The  new  line  will  transmit  power \nproduced domestically by hydropower and fossil fuel generation in the country\u2019s northern region, \nas  well  as  accommodate  power  imports  from  neighboring  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan to supply Afghanistan\u2019s domestic needs. \nD.

The Government of Afghanistan requested a grant not exceeding $159 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project.11 The ADB-administered AITF will \ncofinance, through a $57 million grant, defined components of the project.12 ADB and AITF \nfunding for the project includes financing of taxes and duties (including the business receipt \ntax).13 ADB has been financing project taxes and duties in Afghanistan since 2011 and is \njustified because (i) the amount will not represent an excessive share of the project investment \nplan, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing of \nthe taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. This is in line with \n                                                \n10 Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are included in the project \nadministration manual (PAM) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 A country's eligibility for the ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt \ndistress. The latest debt-sustainability analysis determined that Afghanistan had a high risk of debt distress and \nwas therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n12 AITF is an ADB-administered fund for infrastructure development financing in Afghanistan. The contributors include \nthe governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The AITF financiers have \napproved and confirmed cofinancing of $57 million for the project. \n13 Taxes and duties costs are the business receipt tax, estimated at 2%; the fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%; and \ncustom duties of 2.5%\u201316%. They do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are within \napplicable country partnership strategy parameters. ADB. 2005.

It is anticipated that, by the end of 2013, an additional contribution will be made to AITF \nin the amount of $60 million for purposes of financing activities in the power and energy sector. \nIn the event of such additional contribution, it is proposed to substitute $60 million of the grant \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the project with an equivalent amount from AITF, \nresulting in a reduction in the grant from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to $99 million and an \nincrease  in  the  grant  from  AITF  to  $117  million.  The  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the \nproposed additional AITF grant, and administration thereof, in the event that such additional \nfunds are contributed to AITF.14 Application of such additional AITF funds to the project shall be \nreported to the Board in accordance with standard reporting procedures. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  DABS  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  is  a  100%  state-owned  corporate  entity \nresponsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution in Afghanistan. DABS was \nincorporated in March 2008 and operationalized on 30 September 2009 through a presidential \ndecree. DABS is the legal successor to all rights and obligations of Da Afghanistan Breshna \nMousasa. \n \n21.  DABS has an established, full-time program management office (PMO) that administers \nthe  ADB-assisted  Energy  MFF  (footnote  2).  The  PMO  administers  all  consulting  and \nprocurement contracts and is responsible for preparing project plans, bid evaluation reports, \nprogress reports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and any other reports required by ADB. \nThe PMO has 30 personnel. The staff comprises a project director, engineers, procurement \nspecialists, financial specialists, and safeguards specialists.  \n \n22.  The project\u2019s turnkey transmission line and substation package and the implementation \nsupervision consulting package will be cofinanced, with AITF funds being front-end loaded for \ndisbursement  purposes  for  both  the  turnkey  and  consulting  services  contracts.  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources will be disbursed only after 100% of the AITF funds have \nbeen disbursed. It is expected that AITF funds will finance the first $54.0 million of the turnkey \ncontract and the first $3.0 million a project supervision consultancy contract, with ADB financing \n                                                \n14 By a letter dated 23 October 2013, the Government of Afghanistan agreed to such substitution of financing for the \nproject in the event of such additional AITF contribution. \n ", "6 \nthe remaining components. The use of contingency funds will follow the same disbursement \nprocedure. \n \n23.    Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the project will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding will be used for the 500-kV transmission line and the 500-\nkV/220-kV substation turnkey contract package, comprising two lots: one for transmission line \ncomponent and one for the substation component. \n \n24.  All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm will be recruited using \nquality- and cost-based selection under a full technical proposal. This is required due to the \ncomplex  nature  of  the  consulting  tasks  and  the  critical  nature  of  the  project\u2019s  projected \ndownstream impact.  \n \n25.  ADB will disburse the funds for the turnkey contract package through direct payment and \ncommitment procedures.  \n \n26.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n27.  An international consulting firm was recruited by the executing agency under the project \npreparatory component16 of ADB\u2019s Energy Sector Development Investment Program (footnote \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n2). The consultant firm undertook due diligence of the proposed transmission line and the \nsubstation project. The firm confirmed that forecast demand and export potential justified the \nconstruction of the 500-kV transmission line and a 500-kV/220-kV substation, and that the \nlinking upstream and downstream investments were adequate.17 Firms qualified to perform the \nturnkey contract are available in the international market. The turnkey contractor will train DABS \nstaff in operation and maintenance. \n \n28.  ADB conducted technical due diligence on the proposed project and is satisfied with the \nquality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, and \nthe execution plan. The project readiness level is high, and the technical solutions proposed are \nconsidered to be more cost-effective than the alternatives.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The economic and financial analysis considered the 500-kV transmission line and the \n500-kV/220-kV substation at Dashte Alwan of the project, together with the 500-kV substation at \nthe Arghundy end of the line expected to be financed under the MFF, as one undertaking. While \nfinanced  separately  under  two  ADB  interventions,  the  three  individual  power  system \ncomponents\u2014the  transmission  line  and  the  two  end-line  substations\u2014are  complementary, \ninterdependent and mutually inclusive, and will produce overall incremental benefits as a whole \nthat cannot be broken down financially or economically into parts.  \n30.   The analysis found the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) under the base case to be \n8.97%. Based on sensitivity testing, the FIRR remained at 7.32% under a scenario of a 20.00% \nincrease in estimated capital costs. The FIRR decreased to 6.26% if the line capacity was only \n80.00% used due to lower-than-expected demand development. The FIRR was 8.37% with an \nincrease of 20.00% in estimated O&M costs. These FIRRs are higher than the  estimated \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.87%. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that \nthe financial viability of the project would remain robust under adverse conditions.  \n31.   The analysis showed a base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 26.19%. \nThe EIRR was also robust under the adverse conditions projected by sensitivity analysis. An \nincrease in estimated capital costs by 20.00% reduced the EIRR to 22.88%, still well above the \n12.00% benchmark. The EIRR remained well over 12.00% with a 20.00% decrease in estimated \nenergy transmission and with a 20.00% increase in projected O&M costs. If willingness-to-pay \nwas measured with the long-run marginal cost as a basis, the EIRR would increase to 41.57%.  \nC.  Governance \n32.  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  assessment  of  DABS  found  that  it  follows  accrual \naccounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and other generally accepted accounting principles and \nconventions in compliance with international standards. Its annual financial statements for the \nfirst 3 years, FY2010\u2013FY2012, have been audited and considered acceptable by ADB. Project \nfinancial statements for ADB-financed projects have been prepared, audited, and submitted to \nADB on time since 2010. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \n16Tranche  1  had  a  component  for  conducting  due  diligence  and  preparing  future  projects  listed  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s national priority program for the energy sector. \n17 The 500-kV/220-kV substation at the northern end of the 500-kV transmission line is to be financed under tranche 5 \n($49.1 million) of the multitranche financing facility (MFF-0026). Tranche 5 is being processed in parallel with this \nproject. \n ", "8 \n33.  To continue improving the corporate and financial management capacities of DABS and \nto ensure appropriate governance arrangements for project-related activities, the project will  \n(i)  make use of the existing PMO and maintain separate project accounts, \n(ii)  recruit an international consulting firm to assist in project implementation, \n(iii)  establish  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants, and \n(iv)  require that an independent auditor acceptable to ADB be engaged by DABS to \naudit  project  and  corporate financial statements  annually  in  accordance  with \napplicable ADB requirements. \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DABS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The project does not entail direct impacts on affordability or operational employment \nopportunities. During construction, the contractor will be required to ensure equal opportunities \nfor all social groups, equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, and prohibition of child \nlabor.   \n \n36.  The project has no gender elements, therefore, gender monitoring is not required.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n37.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  DABS  prepared  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IIE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP) in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  environmental  impacts \nanticipated during the construction are site-specific and temporary and can be mitigated through \nimplementation of the EMP. Potential environmental impacts of the project during operations \ninclude fragmentation of the bird habitats and the electrocution or injury of birds through collision \nand contact with wires in the vicinity of Salang-Kotal bird habitat. The EMP mitigation measures \nare adequate and include the careful routing of the transmission line to be undertaken during \ndetailed design, which will consider a baseline ornithological survey in the vicinity of Salang-\nKotal bird habitat; specially designed poles, conductors, and insulators; and the provision of bird \ndiverters. The draft initial environmental examination report was disclosed on the ADB\u2019s website \non 23 August 2013. The current security situation along the line route has made it difficult to \nconsult effectively with communities. The public consultations will be conducted and the IIE and \nEMP  updated  prior  to  construction.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  will  be  reported  through \nenvironmental monitoring reports, which will be submitted to ADB semiannually. Environmental \nspecialists of the implementation consultant will provide additional support to the PMO. \n \n38.  The project is category C for indigenous peoples. The field social survey found that no \nethnic minority, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), will be involved in or \naffected by the project. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement. Based on the \npreliminary project design, a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared \nin close consultation with 12 affected households. It was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 \nAugust 2013, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A detailed socioeconomic \nsurvey was carried out in May 2013. Once the contractor completes the detailed design, DABS \nwill update the LARP and submit it to ADB for approval. No civil works will start until the LARP is \n ", "9 \nfully implemented by DABS. The transmission line will run mainly through government land \nalong the existing 220-kV transmission line. The substation site is owned by the government. \n \n39.  Implementation  of  the  LARP  will  be  monitored  semiannually  and  a  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB. The report will include the number of affected households that have been \npaid compensation, the amount paid, and the locations where compensation was completed \nand structures demolished, if any.  \n \n40.  ADB will review the periodic environment and resettlement monitoring reports submitted \nsemiannually  by  DABS  during  project  construction.  DABS  will  develop  and  implement  an \nappropriate corrective action plan agreed upon with ADB to rectify any default on the safeguard \nrequirements covenanted in the legal agreements or any other failure to comply with safeguards. \nThe environment and resettlement monitoring reports and any corrective action plan submitted \nby DABS during project implementation will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website upon receipt. ADB's \nmonitoring and supervision activities will continue until a project completion reportis issued. \n \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.
