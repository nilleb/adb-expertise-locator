I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion East\u2013\nWest Economic Corridor Agriculture Infrastructure Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project2 will support the continuing transition of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor \n(EWEC) into an inclusive economic growth corridor, in line with the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS)  Strategic  Framework.3  It  will  be  implemented  in  the  two  southern  provinces  of \nSavannakhet and Saravane, which are within the area of influence of the EWEC and have 20% \nof the country\u2019s population. The project will target areas of good agricultural potential with \nexisting irrigation schemes. It aims to regenerate, replace, and upgrade underdeveloped or \noutdated agriculture infrastructure, including irrigation and rural access infrastructure.4 This will \nenhance agriculture productivity (and incomes) in some of the country\u2019s poorest districts. It will \nsupport  capacity  development,  at  the  farm  level,  to  manage  and  use  the  agriculture \ninfrastructure efficiently and effectively to optimize agricultural outputs. It will stimulate rural \ndevelopment, sustainable agriculture practices, and trade.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Investments in EWEC\u2019s physical infrastructure, supported by Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  financed  projects,  are  creating  opportunities  for  trade  and  economic \ndevelopment.5 The GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program focuses on connectivity, \ncompetitiveness, and community\u2014both local and community of nations. In preparation for the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community in 2015, the Ayeyawady\u2013Chao \nPhraya\u2013Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy has prioritized cooperation in rice production \nand food security, underpinned by improved infrastructure.6 At the Ayeyawady\u2013Chao Phraya\u2013\nMekong Economic Cooperation Strategy summit in March 2013, the Lao PDR and Thailand \nagreed to reduce import\u2013export tariffs for agriculture-related inputs and produce, and facilitate \ntrade and contract farming for the Lao PDR.7 The Project will contribute to these GMS initiatives \nby  improving  access for  all  people  in  the  project  areas  to  EWEC markets  and  economic \nopportunities, including those of neighboring countries. The profitability of smallholder farming in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing Rural Access Improvement Project along the \nEast-West Economic Corridor Project. Manila. (TA 7728-LAO).  \n3  The EWEC is an important component of ADB\u2019s commitment to, and involvement in, development of the GMS. \n4  Agriculture infrastructure refers to irrigation (pumping stations, weirs, canals, water management, and control \nstructures) and access infrastructure (low volume rural roads and bridges).  \n5  ADB supported projects include: ADB. 2012.

Manila; ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n6  Members of the Ayeyawady\u2013Chao Phraya\u2013Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy are Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ADB is providing assistance to the strategy. \n7  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Lao PDR and Thai Prime Ministers on 15 March 2013. ", "2   \nproject areas will be increased by enabling participating communities to respond to market pull \nfrom  the  EWEC  by  (i)  increasing  the  intensity  and  diversity  of  agricultural  production;  (ii) \nproviding quicker and safer access to markets, social services, and employment opportunities; \nand (iii) reducing the costs of agricultural inputs, marketing, and post-harvest losses. \n \n4.  The  Lao  PDR  has  had  an  annual  rice  deficit,  estimated  at  100,000 t  in  2012. \nReducing this deficit is a national priority and upgrading agriculture infrastructure will provide the \nfoundation for doing so. Improved irrigation will enable increased yields in the rainy season as a \nresult  of  supplementary  irrigation  and  an  expansion  of  dry  season  cultivation.8  Irrigation \nimprovements will also help overcome long dry season droughts and overall foster climate \nchange adaptation. Irrigation integrated with rural access improvements will lead to increases in \nincome  from  both  on-  and  off-farm  employment;  expand  income  generation  opportunities, \nespecially for women; improve access to markets, schools, and hospitals; and increase food \navailability. Associated capacity building measures will focus on water users groups (WUGs) \nand/or water users associations (WUAs) that are already established, with varying capacities, in \nmost of the functioning irrigation schemes.9 They are responsible for operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of the existing irrigation schemes, and often are doing well keeping old, poorly designed \nand constructed schemes functioning. The project will assist WUGs and WUAs to manage the \nimproved infrastructure and use it to realize market-based optimal agricultural production.   \n \n5.  The provinces of Savannakhet and Saravane account for 33% of the total rice \nproduced in the Lao PDR (917,000 tons [t]).10 They have a combined population of 1,150,000 \nwith an average poverty rate of 36%. Savannakhet has the highest population of the five \nsouthern provinces, and the highest number of poor districts.11 They have a combined reported \narea of about 312,300 hectares (ha) under cultivation, but less than 10% of this area has \nirrigated dry season production. Crop yields are below potential, and farming generally remains \nat semi-subsistence levels with little diversification.12 Currently, poor quality and inadequate \ncoverage of irrigation constrains agriculture production\u2014especially in the dry season\u2014resulting \nin limited areas being planted and low yields, a limited variety of produce, with high production, \ntransport, and marketing costs, and hence lower farm incomes.  \n \n6.  The project is consistent with the government\u2019s sector development objectives as \npresented in its Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, Strategy for \nAgricultural Development 2020, and Agricultural Master Plan, 2011\u20132015, which promote the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. It \nwill be a key component in the government\u2019s new Southern Rural Development Program.13 The \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program, supporting the \nthrust to strengthen infrastructure and agriculture, as well as the priority to develop the EWEC. \nProject objectives are consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR and \nits focus on agriculture infrastructure as a means of promoting pro-poor, sustainable growth \n                                                \n8 Supplementary irrigation reduces crop stress during dry periods of the rainy season. \n9  WUGs are informal groupings of farmers within an irrigation scheme. WUAs are associations with legal standing \nand status that can enter into contracts and undertake commercial activities. One of the institutional challenges \nwithin the project area is to convert WUGs to WUAs and to improve the functioning of existing WUAs. \n10  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Food Programme. 2011.

The project design draws on the experience of ADB-financed rural development \ninitiatives  as  well  as  those  of  the  development  partners.15  Relevant  current  projects16 \ninclude the Northern Rural Infrastructure Sector Project and the Sustainable Natural Resource \nManagement and Productivity Enhancement Project, co-financed by ADB and the International \nFund  for  Agricultural  Development.17  Similar  successfully  completed  projects  include  the \nNorthern  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project,  the  Decentralized  Irrigation \nDevelopment and Management Sector Project, and the Community-Managed Irrigation Sector \nProject.18 A major lesson from previous projects is the need for the full understanding and \nparticipation of project beneficiaries to manage and use the improved agriculture infrastructure. \nOperationally, with a consideration of capacity constraints, sufficient project duration is required \nfor the execution of civil works at the beginning of the project and beneficiary training and \ncapacity building to be undertaken thereafter. Other lessons include the need to (i) prescreen \nsubprojects to  identify  viable  ones  with  minimal  safeguard  issues; (ii)  limit  the geographic \ncoverage to obtain a balance between capital investments and overhead costs, and contain \nimplementation weaknesses to a manageable level; (iii) maintain a confined scope of activities \nto  those  that  can  be  readily  carried  out  within  local  capacities;  (iv)  carefully  prepare  the \nprocurement plan to optimize the contract size, number, and methodology; and (v) take advance \nactions  to  ensure  competent  project  staff  are  trained,  and  accelerate  procurement  and \nconsultant recruitment. \n \n8.  In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and participating \nprovinces, 27 candidate subprojects from the Provincial Socio-Economic Development Plans \nwere screened for inclusion and were found to meet preliminary technical, financial, economic, \nenvironment, and social eligibility criteria.19 Subproject feasibility studies were carried out on \nthree representative subprojects, with positive results, indicating substantial increases in farm \nincomes from higher production and increased employment.20 The remaining subprojects have \nbeen prioritized and will be subject to full feasibility studies during implementation. Available \nfunding suggests that 25 subprojects will be implemented using ADB loan proceeds.  \n \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2012.

Sector Lending, Operations Manual. OM D3/BP. \nManila, are fully met. The Lao PDR has its Strategy for Agricultural Development to 2020 to meet the priority \ndevelopment needs of the sector. It has the institutional capacity to implement this sector development plan, \nfollowing experience in five previous sector development projects financed by ADB. The policies applicable to the \nagriculture sector are appropriate and will be improved through the proposed project, in particular those relating to \nO&M of agriculture infrastructure by WUGs and WUAs.  \n20 The subprojects were Beungxe and Phanomxy in Savannakhet and Vapy Neau in Saravane.   \n ", "4   \n9.  The project has two technical innovations that highlight ADB\u2019s value addition to \nthe sector by contributing to the ongoing sector policy dialogue on water resource management \nand  irrigation  sustainability:  (i)  an  8-year  project  duration  in  light  of  sector  implementation \nconstraints  to  enable  intensive  and  extensive  WUG  and WUA  capacity  development  after \ncompletion of civil works, and (ii) integration of soil and water conservation measures through \nbioengineering techniques into agriculture infrastructure design. This will improve the stability of \nthe infrastructure, and soil quality, as many soils in the project area are depleted of nutrients \nand are easily erodible. An implementation innovation is the provision of start-up consultants to \nsupport  project  implementation  activities  while  the  loan  implementation  consultants  are \nrecruited, thus avoiding implementation delays. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the project will be increased household incomes in the project \nareas. The expected outcome will be increased agricultural productivity in the project areas.  \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have three outputs: (i) improved agriculture infrastructure, with activities \ncarried  out  by  implementing  subprojects,  including  (a)  civil  works  to  improve  irrigation \ninfrastructure in 25 schemes, (b) constructing low volume rural roads that support the mobility \nand transport needs of the population in and around the irrigation schemes, and (c) generating \nemployment during civil works that benefits local people including women and ethnic groups; (ii) \nincreased capacity of farmers to manage and use agriculture infrastructure efficiently, with \nactivities in all subprojects including (a) establishing and implementing agriculture infrastructure \nmanagement and operation plans, (b) preparing and implementing WUG and WUA agricultural \ndevelopment plans, and (c) strengthening WUGs to graduate to WUAs; and (iii) efficient project \nmanagement  by  meeting  time  lines  for  successfully  (a) operating  a  national  project \nmanagement  office  (NPMO)  and  two  provincial  project  management  offices  (PPMOs);  (b) \nrecruiting and fielding consultants for project start-up, implementation, benefit, and safeguard \nmonitoring; and (c) completing subproject feasibility studies and construction works. All of the \nactivities have specific gender targets. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans   \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $60.6 million (Table 1). \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

The implementing arrangements will follow established precedents from other ADB-\nfinanced projects in the sector. MAF will be the executing agency with responsibility for overall \nproject coordination and management. MAF will establish an NPMO, which will be responsible \nfor overall coordination and project delivery, including reporting on project progress to the \nexecuting agency and ADB, and technical support for subproject design and approval. The \ntechnical support will include preparation of subproject investment reports and detailed designs, \nrecruitment of consultants, procurement of civil works, and subproject implementation, including \nconstruction supervision. The provincial governments of Savannakhet and Saravane will be the \nproject  implementing  agencies,  with  one  vice-governor  responsible  for  implementation \ncoordination  in  each  province.  Each  provincial  government  will  delegate  responsibility  for \nprovincial level project implementation activities to the respective Provincial Agriculture and \nForestry Office (PAFO). The PAFOs will be responsible for reporting to the provincial vice-\ngovernor and the NPMO. Each PAFO will establish a PPMO. The PPMOs will provide day-to-\nday project support for implementation of the subprojects. They will facilitate input from relevant \nprovincial line departments for the subproject design and implementation. The PPMOs will be \nmanaged by a provincial project manager from the PAFO and one full-time deputy manager.  \n \n17.  Subproject implementation support will be provided by the PPMO with the assistance of \nthe  district  coordination  office  (DCO),  which  will  ensure  that  during  subproject  preparation \nconsultation actions are carried out with provincial and district stakeholder agencies and village \nauthorities. Meetings will be arranged with male and female farmers, village leaders, poor \nhouseholds, WUGs, and private small-scale traders and buyers, to identify their constraints and \ncapacity and to understand irrigation and mobility and transport issues. During implementation, \nDCOs will ensure communication and awareness to enable participation and access to project \nbenefits, including capacity building and training, access to employment opportunities, and \ncommunity participation at village level in agriculture infrastructure planning and development.  \n \n18.  Capacity building activities aimed at improved O&M and agriculture practices will begin \nduring the feasibility study period, with strong input from the PAFOs and DCOs. Subprojects \nfound feasible will be prepared to detailed design level and, after bidding, constructed under the \nsupervision of the NPMO, the PPMO, and the DCO. Subprojects will be implemented in three \nphases: (i) implementation of the three representative subprojects prepared during the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance,  (ii)  the  next  10  priority  subprojects,  and  (iii)  about \n12 subprojects subject to remaining funds. This is to ensure that sufficient funds will be available \nfor the top priorities in case of cost overruns. Loan implementation consultants will carry out \nsubproject  feasibility  studies  and  social  and  economic  safeguards  studies.  The  loan \nimplementation consultants will assist the NPMO to ensure that appropriate technical standards \nare incorporated in the design, the costs reflect realistic market estimates, and the social and \nenvironmental safeguards requirements of ADB and the government are met.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The technology involved for most subprojects is straightforward and within the capacities \nof engineers and contractors available in the Lao PDR. Works will entail mainly upgrading and \nrepair of existing structures and facilities. The irrigation systems to be upgraded are mainly \npumped irrigation schemes, but also include a few small to medium-sized reservoirs and run-of-\nriver  diversion  weirs.  For  the  pumped  schemes,  improvement  will  primarily  entail  the \nreplacement of worn out pumping systems and the improvement and repair of canals. For \ngravity systems, repair or replacement of the headworks will usually be necessary, as well as \ncanal improvements. Access roads will be constructed of concrete to provide all-weather service \n ", "   7 \nand  reduced  maintenance  costs.  This  technology  is  labor-intensive  and  will  increase \nemployment opportunities during construction. It is also appropriate since many areas flood \nduring the rainy season and concrete can withstand submergence for extended periods. The \nproject will strengthen the WUGs and WUAs to ensure that upgraded systems continue to be \noperational and produce profitable crops. Experience under completed projects indicates that \nenhanced  operational  funding  and  guidance  from  specialized  consultants  can  significantly \nimprove  O&M  as  well  as  cropping  patterns.  Capacity  building  technical  assistance  for \nSupporting Decentralized Rural Infrastructure Development will also contribute to strengthening \nthe WUGs and WUAs.24 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n20.  A number of direct and indirect benefits will accrue from the project. Some of the direct \nbenefits  are  improved  rice  and  vegetable  crop  yields  together  with  increased  cropping \nintensities, reduced transit time, off-season and off-farm employment opportunities (particularly \nfor women), access to markets and market information, strengthening and promotion of WUGs. \nThese benefits will translate into an overall improvement in the standard of living. In addition, \nincreased access to health care services, nutrition, and children\u2019s education are some indirect \nbenefits that will accrue from the project.  Investment costs associated with these benefits \ninclude  agriculture  infrastructure,  extension  services,  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement. The distributional analysis confirms significant benefits to the poor. Analysis of \nthe representative subprojects indicates that the productivity of both wet and dry season rice \nand vegetable crops will improve significantly. Average rice yields are expected to increase from \n3.0 t/ha to 4.5 t/ha while annual cropping intensity is expected to increase from 140% to 180%. \nThis will significantly contribute to reducing the national annual deficit by approximately 38,000 t. \nThe estimated average annual income per household will increase from $1,375 to $3,030. The \nfinancial analysis indicates that the O&M costs of the improved assets are affordable. The \nestimated economic internal rates of return for the representative subprojects are 16%\u201324% \nbased on quantifiable benefits. The sensitivity analyses are attractive and robust as none of the \nrisk factors appear to place the investments in immediate jeopardy. These economic returns are \nused as a proxy to assess the overall economic viability of the project.25 Subprojects with an \neconomic internal rate of return above 12%, as indicated in feasibility studies, will be eligible for \nproject financing. \n \nC.   Governance \n21.  The  main  governance  issues  are  expected  to  arise  during  procurement  and  with \nmanagement of the project\u2019s finances. MAF has considerable experience in procuring civil \nworks  and  goods  and  services  under  ADB  projects.  All  procurement  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants to be financed by the loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). A financial management assessment indicates that MAF \nis capable of undertaking financial management of the project.26 MAF will ensure that the NPMO \nand PPMOs maintain adequate financial records. Consolidated project financial statements \nshould  be  prepared  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A \nnational financial management specialist has been included in the project as an individual loan \n                                                \n24 ADB. 2012.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  Analysis of declines in poverty rates since 1998 show that the greatest gains have been \nmade where there are improved links to markets, with poverty persisting in more remote rural \nareas without road access. Combined provincial average poverty rates are 36%, and 10%\u201320% \nin  the  representative  subprojects,  with  women  generally  poorer  than  men.  Agriculture \ncontributes 70%\u201390% to rural household incomes. Investments in irrigation rehabilitation will \nimprove the incomes and food security of households and, through associated investments, \nprovide opportunities for women and men to access relevant capacity building activities. The \ncivil works will generate at least $8 million in labor wages and thereafter households in the \nrepresentative subprojects are predicted to gain an average of 57\u201383 days of employment \nannually from increased farm labor demand.27 \n \n24.  The impact for women is potentially greater than for men, considering the significantly \ngreater labor inputs they provide in cropping, water collection, and marketing of agricultural \nproduce. The project\u2019s gender classification is effective gender mainstreaming (category 2). To \nensure that benefits accrue to women, a gender action plan has been prepared for the project.28 \nWomen, including women\u2019s groups and the Lao Women\u2019s Union, as well as PAFO and DAFO \nSubcommittee  for  the  Advancement  of Women  members,  will  be  consulted  on  agriculture \ninfrastructure design. This will include separate meetings for women, held at appropriate times \nand using language and cultural sensitivity that allow women to participate. Contractors will be \nencouraged to employ women in civil works, and men and women will receive equal pay for \nwork of equal type. Participation of women in WUGs will be promoted. To improve safety along \nroads to be upgraded, funds have been provided for road safety information campaigns. In \naddition, awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS will be carried out in the subproject areas. The \nsafety campaigns and systems will be developed to ensure the needs of vulnerable groups \n(including children and women) are addressed. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment  (category  B).  Subprojects  are  mainly  limited  to  the  rehabilitation  of \nexisting infrastructure, and the screening process has eliminated subprojects with potentially \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. This was confirmed during detailed analyses of the \nthree representative subprojects. However, some minor negative environmental effects may \noccur during the construction process. To strengthen MAF\u2019s capacity, additional training for \nNPMO  safeguard  staff  and  PPMOs  is  included  in  the  project  costs.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  and  the  list  of  responsibilities  for  environmental \nmanagement are included in the PAM to guide the government to carry out an appropriate level \nof  environmental  assessment  and  to  take  corresponding  measures  to  deal  with  potential \n                                                \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "   9 \nenvironmental impacts.29 The paving of roads will reduce dust, which has negative impacts on \nhuman and livestock health, crops, and safety. Measures to improve climate change resilience \ninclude stabilizing local environments by integrating soil and water conservation measures into \nsubproject  design.  Improved  irrigation  efficiency  and  sustainable  agricultural  practices  will \nreduce stresses on water and land resources. \n \n26.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  No  significant  resettlement  impacts  are \nexpected because the majority of agriculture infrastructure will be improved along existing \nrights-of-way and will at most require the provision of compensation for roadside trees, crops \nand/or  small  structures,  with  possibly  a  small  amount  of  land  acquisition.  Category  A \nsubprojects  were  eliminated  during  screening.  It  will  be  necessary  to  document  the  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  status  of  each  subproject  during  the  preparation  of  feasibility \nstudies.  The  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework  along  with \nprocedures, resources, and responsibilities for preparing resettlement plans outlined in the PAM \nfor  potential  category  B  subprojects.30  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  three \nrepresentative subprojects with no land acquisition needed. Any required resettlement plans will \nbe  submitted  and  approved  by  ADB  before  the  selected  subprojects  are  implemented. \nCompensation,  allowances,  operation,  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  will  be  financed  from  loan  proceeds.  An  adequate  budget  for  resettlement  plan \npreparation  and  implementation  will  be  allocated  accordingly  as  well  as  provision  of \nresettlement specialists.  \n \n27.  Ethnic groups (category B): The population in the project area is predominantly Lao-\nThai, with Mon-Khmer groups generally found in the uplands of Saravane. Project activities will \nnot cause involuntary changes in the ethnic groups\u2019 farming and livelihoods system or their \ncultural  practice  and  ancestral  domains.31  Any  possible  negative  impact,  such  as  loss  of \ntemporary crops and livelihoods, will be avoided if possible or will be compensated accordingly. \nImpacts on ethnic groups in these areas are expected to be overwhelmingly positive since the \nsubprojects will be aimed at overall economic and social improvement of the total population. \nSpecific measures to deal with potential negative impacts and to encourage participation and \ncontribution of ethnic groups based on their unique social and cultural characteristics require \ncustomized approaches and interventions. In the general design of some subprojects, there \nmay be opportunities for ethnic groups to participate in and/or benefit from the subproject \nactivities. An ethnic group planning framework agreed upon by the government and ADB has \nbeen prepared to address this situation.32 It will guide the preparation of an ethnic group plan for \npotential category B subprojects based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will \napprove the ethnic group plans before the subproject is implemented.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \n \n                                                \n29 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n31 \u201cEthnic group\u201d is the government\u2019s preferred term for indigenous people, Constitution of The Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, 2003, article 8. \n32 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Group Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFinancial and Economic:  Significant investments in agricultural extension support at farm level will \nFluctuations in commodity prices  enable diversification of cropping patterns and optimize yields.
