To reverse declines in India\u2019s \ntrade  volume  in  late  2008  and  early  2009,  India  has  made  the \nexpansion  of  market  share  and  employment  and  income  generation \nin  its  poorest  regions  key  objectives  of  its  foreign  trade  policy.  The \npace  of \ninternational \ncompetition,  and  the  ongoing  dispersion  and  interpenetration  of \nproductive  activity  along  production  chains  in  Asia  have  convinced \npolicy makers  and  entrepreneurs  alike  that  participation  in  regional \nvalue  chains  and  production  clusters  and  networks  is  the  key  to \n\ntechnological  change, \n\nintensity  of \n\nthe \n\nEnvironmental an\nSocial Safeguards\n\nd \n \n\nEnvironment: Category FI \nIndigenous peoples: Category C \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \n\nRationale \n\n\fii \n\n \n\neconomic  growth.

A  1% \nincrease  in  the  share  of  trade  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  estimate\nd  to  decrease  a \ncountry\u2019s poverty rate by 0.6%.1 Trade openness and the increase in income \nand decrease in \npoverty  are  strongly  associated,  pointing  to  large  trickle-down  effects  to \nsmall  business, \nemployment,  and  income  through  the  manufacturing  value  chain.  India  re\nmains  a  small \nparticipant in global production networks, with only a 7% share of parts and com\nponents in total \nmanufacturing  exports.2  Since  fiscal year  (FY)  2000,  the  dollar  value  of  India\u2019\ns  labor-intensive \nexports of agricultural produce have surged  by 14% yearly, and manufactured\n goods by 24%, \nindicating  the  initial  integration  of  rural  areas  and  farmers,  as  well  as  sm\nall  and  medium \nenterprises  (SMEs),  into  the  global  value  chain.  Experienced  corporate \nexporters  have, \nhowever, not yet established large supply networks with small businesses and\n farmers in rural \nIndia;  thus,  trade  has  so  far  not \nbeen  fully  effective  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  rural  areas, \nespecially  in  the  backward  and  poorer  regions  of  India.  This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  the \nfindings  of  an  ADB  report  (footnote  2)  and  of  the  G8, 3   the  G24, 4   and  t\nhe  World  Trade \nOrganization  substantiating  the  Aid  for  Trade  initiative.5  In  view  of  the  present\n  adverse  global \neconomic environment for trade, and India\u2019s projected loss of up to 10 growth p\noints in the next \n2 years as a result of the 2009 fall in export volumes, adaptation investment is\n needed to avert \noverly negative income and poverty effects. \n\n3. \nthe  market  and  governance  failures  that  prevent  SME  market  entry  and  linka\npoorer  regions.

Th\ne  highest  SME \nexport development priority is assigned to clusters in lagging regions and state\ns, which account \nfor  only  for  a  small  share  of  established  clusters.  SMEs  often  act  as  anc\nillaries  (indirect \nexporters) for the large-scale producers, central distributors, and lead firms alo\nng value chains, \nproviding them with vital components and backward linkages. So far, these SM\nEs are excluded \nfrom  modern  value  chains.  Exim  Bank  has  been  designated  by  the  Governm\nent  as  the  lead \nagency  for  the  promotion  of  export-oriented  SMEs  and  of  lower-technology\n  SME  \u201cpoverty-\nintensive\u201d  clusters.

An  outward-looking  and  liberal  trade  policy  is  o\n5. \nne  of  the  main \nfeatures of India\u2019s economic reforms. India intends to stimulate growth in trade,\n exploit its labor \nadvantage, and broaden the bene\nfits from trade growth with more-inclusive growth. Recognizing \nthe  opportunities  and  challenges  of  integration  in  an  increasingly  globalized  world\n  economy, \nIndia,  under  its  Foreign  Trade  Policy  2004\u20132009,  looks  forward  to  doubling  its  sh\nare  in  world \ntrade  to  2%  and  generating  more  employment  by  promoting  labor-intensive\n  exports.  India\u2019s \ntrade  stra\ntegy  has  set  its  sights  on  (i)  rationalizing  tariffs  and  tax  rebates,  and  reducing \ntransaction  costs;  (ii)  producing  better-quality  and  more-reliable  exports;  (iii)  upgrading  export \ninfrastructure;  and  (iv)  improving  medium-  to  long-term  trade  finance  (export  finance).

The  Indian  economy,  particularly  the  tra\nde  sector,  has \nbenefited  significantly  from  global  trends  and  the  reforms  pursued  by  the  Gov\nernment.  India\u2019s \nshare  in  world  exports  increased  marginally  from  about  0.7%  in  2001  to  1.8%\n  in  2006,  and  is \nhewing to the target of close to 2% for 2009, despite the adverse global econom\nic environment. \nExport volume tripled from 2001 to 2006, growing by 22% yearly on average, a\nnd imports grew \nby  28%  yearly,  to  more  than  four  times  the  volume  in  2001.  Service  expor\nts,  especially  in \ninformation  technology,  biotechnology,  call  centers,  and  other  administrat\nive  outsourcing, \nincreased \nby an annual average of 34%, while service imports during the same period grew by \nan  annual  average  of  22%.  The  dramatic  surge  in  India\u2019s  openness,  especially  up  to  2008,  is \nshown in Table 1. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP increased from 5.8% in FY1991 to \n15.5%  in  FY2008,  while  the  ratio  of  imports  to  GDP  increased  from  8.8%  to  23.5%.  India\u2019s \nexport growth (by volume) during the period, led by a surge in manufactured exports, was also \nhigher than the world average. However, because of infrastructure and political constraints, the \ntrade  value  chains  within  India  have  not  yet  tapped  the  poorer  regions  and  lagging  states  or \nintegrated them into the global economy. The vast potential of these regions for increased trade \nis recognized. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nTable 1: India\u2019s Openness to the World Economy, 1990\u20132009 \n(% of GDP) \n\n1990\u20131991 1995\n\nItem \nMerchandise Trade \nTrade in Goods and Services \nGross Capital Transactions \n\u2014 = not applicable, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India, Report on Currency and Finance, various years. \n\n00\u2013200\n23 \n29 \n22 \n\n\u201319\n22 \n26 \n13 \n\n15\n \n17 \n12 \n\n96 20\n\n1\n\n\u2013200\n33 \n45 \n32 \n\n2005\n\n6  2\n\n007\u201320082008\u20132009\n\n39 \n48 \n44 \n\n36 \n46 \n\u2014 \n\n10. \nDiversification to south\u2013south trade. Although the United States is s\ntill India\u2019s largest \ntrade  partner,  its  importance  is  declining  even  as  other  Asian  and  even  Afric\nan  countries  are \ngaining ground. Since FY2001, the United States\u2019 share in India\u2019s trade has de\nclined from 13% \nto 9.7%, while the PRC\u2019s share has increased from 2.5% to 7.7%. The share \nof the European \nUnion  has  decreased  from  22%  to  18.72%,  while  that  of  other  Asian  countri\nes  including  the \nPacific has increased from 32.9% to 56%. Trade with the United States and Eu\nrope will remain \nvery  significant,  but  it  will  grow  more  slowly  compared  with  trade  with  new\n  markets.  India \nrecently  identified  opportunities  for  trade  with  other  countries  in  South  As\nia  and  with  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  East  Asia,  and  Africa.

According  to  this  scheme,  a  100%  export-oriented \nunit  is  an  industrial  unit  that  offers  to  export  its  entire  production,  excluding  p\nermitted  sales  in \nthe domestic tariff area, and that may have up to 100% foreign equity particip\nation with certain \nconditions. 10   A  100%  export-oriented  unit  is  also  exempted  from  paying  c\norporate  tax  for \n5 straight  years  in  its  first  8  years  of  operation,  and  is  entitled  to  benefits  inc\nluding  a  special \nimport license, as well as an additional special import license of 2% of the fre\ne-on-board value \nof exports.  \n\n                                                 \n8  The  definition  of  SMEs  differs  between  countries.  SMEs  have  been  defined  against  various\n\n  criteria  such  as  the \nnumber of workers emplo\nyed, the volume of output or sales, the value of assets employed, and the use of energy. \nSMEs, for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), are entities with no more than \n500  employees.  For  the  Mulitilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA)  of  the  World  Bank  Group,  SMEs \nemploy up to 300 and have annual sales of less than $15 million. For the European Union, SMEs employ no more \nthan 250 and their annual turnover does not exceed \u20ac50 million ($70 million).  \n\n9  Small-scale units that invest up to Rs2.5 million in plant and machinery are classified as tiny (or micro) enterprises. \n10 Regarding  their  export  obligations,  100%  export-oriented  units,  among  other  conditions,  (i)  need  not  export  their \nmanufactured goods themselves but may use an export house or trading house, (ii) must execute a bond or legal \nundertaking  with  the  development  commissioner  concerned,  (iii) must  adhere  to  the  minimum  value-addition \nconditions  (in  general,  at  least  35%  value  addition  for  automatic  approvals)  stated  in  the  letter  of  permission  or \nindustrial  license  issued  to  them,  and  (iv)  must  keep  proper  records  of  their  imports,  consumption  and  use  of \nimported materials, and exports.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOverall Performance and Export Contribution of the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Sector  \n\n13. \nAccording to the 11th plan, the country\u2019s 12.8 million SMEs employed \nabout 30 million \npeople  in  2006/2007,  and  MSMEs  employed  about  65  million,  or  about \n70%  of  formal \nemployment  in  India. 11   The  sector  manufactures  more  than  8,000  diverse \nproducts,  valued \ncurrently  at  almost  Rs8,160  billion  and  contributing  around  40%  of  industrial\n  production  and \n50% (35% direct and 15% indirect) of India\u2019s exports. Thus, SMEs are an impo\nrtant instrument \nof  inclusive  growth  in  India,  and  touch  on  the  lives  of  the  most  vulnerable,  in\ncluding  women, \nscheduled tribes, and women and children living in urban slums and in remote \nvillages. The SSI \nsector  has  a  signific\nant  role  in  balanced  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  employment \ngeneration, entrepreneurial skills development, and export earnings. The target growth rate for \nSMEs under the 11th plan is 12%, 2\u20133 percentage points higher than the targe\nt growth rate for \nthe entire industries sector. \n\n14. \nThe comparative advantage of small firms lies in their greater share of v\nalue added from \nlabor\u2014especially semiskilled and skilled labor, and, in the Indian context, eve\nn unskilled labor \n(without completely overcoming disguised unemployment). MSMEs employ 1.39\n employees per \nunit  of  investment,  compared  with  0.2 employees  for  the  same  unit  of  inve\nstment  in  large \nindustries  (Table  3  reference).  Besides,  manufacturing  is  the  most  tradable\n  of  all  sectors, \nespecially when the goods meet international quality standards, are competitive\n, and have long \nshelf  lives.  Successful  industrializing  economies  (especially  late  industrialize\nrs  and  densely \npopulated  industrializing  economies) \nshow  the  crucial  role  of  labor-intensive  manufacturing  in \nthe  transformation  of  the  economy.  The  reason  is  easy  to  see:  the  social\n  price  of  labor  is \ntechnically zero when this factor is in surplus. Since small firms have competitive advantage in \nlabor-intensive  manufacturing,  significant  export  promotion  initiatives  are  clearly  impossible \nwithout  small  firms  in  a  dominant  role.  Small  firms  also  complement  larg\ne  firms  through \nsupply-chain relationships and subcontracting.  \n\n3. \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Clusters for the Inclusion of P\nLagging Regions \n\noor States and \n\n15. \nThe 11th plan of the Government  highlights the importance of the clus\nter development \ninitiative  to  the  integration  of  backward  and  lagging  regions  with  export  ma\nrkets.  Over  400 \nmanufacturing  and  over  6,000  lower-technology  SME  \u201cpov\nerty-intensive\u201d  clusters  will  undergo \nimprovements in competitiveness, with consequent benefits to employment, income growth, and \npoverty reduction. Clusters in the lagging regions and states of India, which account only for a \nsmall  share  of  established  clusters,  have  the  highest  priority  in  SME  export  development. \nTable 3  shows  that  Eastern  India  has  only  9%  of  manufacturing  clusters,  and  that  the  poor \nstates have none. The East and the poor states are similarly underrepresented when it comes \nlding  of  SMEs  in \nto  MSME  clusters.  Hence,  the  Government  views  financing  and  capacity  bui\nthese lagging regions as important for their inclusion in global trade links. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n \n11 Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. 2009. \nSearchable Database for Exportable Technologies from SMEs of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  http://dsir.nic.in/reports/ \nExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/1INTRODUCTION.htm  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nTable 3: Indian Small and Medium Enterprises Clusters, by Region  \n(%) \n\n \n\negion \n\nR\nNorth \nEast \nest \nW\nSouth \nPoor states \nTotal \n\nMa\n\nng \n\nHandic\n\nTra\n\nional \n\ndit\nnufacturi\n31.7 \n9.3 \n36.1 \n22.9 \n0.0 \n100.0 \n\ns \n\nms \n\ndloo\n\n  Han\n\nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprise\nOthers \n24.1 \n16.0 \n27.2 \n29.6 \n3.1 \n100.0 \n\nrafts\n25.7 \n23.2 \n27.5 \n18.1 \n5.5 \n100.0 \n\n23.6 \n.2 \n7\n.6 \n22\n36.0 \n10.6 \n100.0 \n\nSource:  Compiled  from  the  Directorate  of  Handicraft  and  Handlooms;  the  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization; and the third census of SSI units, 2001\u20132002. \n\n4. \n\nFinancing for Small and Medium Enterprises \n\nAt  the  end  of  FY2007,  only  about  8%  of  bank  lending  was  going  to  SSIs.

Further,  the \ninternal  group  formed  by  RBI  to  review  the  guidelines  for  SME  credit  to \nthe  SME  sector \nrecommended  that  commercial  banks  set  their  own  lending  targets  for  t\nhe  sector,  with \ndisbursements  increasing  yearly.  The  internal  group  also  recommended  the\n  continuation  of \nsub-targets  for  the  financing  of  tiny  units  (up  to  40%)  and  smaller  units  (20\n%).  The  finance \nminister,  in  a  statement  in  the  Rajya  Sabha  (upper  house  of  Parliament)  on  1\n0  August  2005, \nproposed  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  of  the  internal  group. \nHe  fixed  a  20% \nminimum  growth  in  credit  to  SME  sector  to  double  the  flow  of  credit  to \nthe  sector  from \nRs676 billion  in  FY2004\u2013FY2005  to  Rs1,350  billion  by  FY2009\u2013FY2010.  How\never,  as  already \nmentioned,  SMEs  at  the  end  of  FY2007  were  attracting  only  8.1%  of  bank  cr\nedit.  On  6  June \n2007,  a  group  under  an  executive  director  of  Exim  Bank  and  comprising  repr\nesentatives  from \nthe Government\u2019s Department of Commerce, commercial banks, SIDBI, trade b\nodies, and three \ndepartments in RBI was created to assess the credit needs of MSME exporters\n. After extensive \ndeliberations,  the  group  recommended  that  50%  of  export  credit  be  earmarke\nd  for  the  MSME \nsector  by  all  banks  includi\nng  foreign  banks.

The  Government  now  gives  priority  to  eliminating  t\nhe  income \nand  poverty  effects  of  economic  deceleration,  by  providing  more  long-term  finance  to  SME \nexporters  and  by  strengthening  the  strategic  development  role  of  Exim  Bank \nin  SME  capacity \nbuilding and technology investment. \n\n                                                \n \n13 The Kapur committee set up by RBI to review the delivery of working capital also recommended that SSI units get \n\nat least 20% of the value of their output. \n\n14 The  Ganguly  committee  also  recommended  that  novel  funding  schemes  for  SMEs  be  introduced  especially  in \n\nbackward regions and areas to remove regional imbalances. \n\n 15 Public sector banks have been advised to operate more specialized SSI branches in centers where the financing \nneeds  of  many  SSI  borrowers  can  be  served.  To  moderate  the  cost  of  credit  to  SSI  units,  banks  have  been \ndirected to grant lower spreads over the prime lending rate to SSI units with a good borrowing record. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n2. \n\nNeed to Tap Further Trade Potential \n\nits \n\nrich  natural \n\nresource  and  mineral  base, \n\nGovernment  recognition  of  the  need  to  act  in  concert  with  the  private  sector. \n22. \n is gaining.

The emergence of intraregional trade in Asia over  the \npast 5 decades as the third hub of world trade next to Europe and North America has followed a \ndistinctive  pattern.  Following  Japan\u2019s  export  success  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  newly \nindustrializing economies began to enter export markets as Japan\u2019s industrial structure shifted \naway  from  labor-intensive  products  to  more  sophisticated  ones.  As  profitability  fell  at  home, \nproducers from Japan and the newly industrializing economies began to move their production \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nchains  into  Southeast  Asia  in  the  1980s.

Although the United States remains \nIndia\u2019s  largest  trade  partner,  its  importance  is  declining,  while  that  of  Asian,  and  even  African \ncountries, is picking up. Since FY2001, the United States\u2019 share of India\u2019s trade declined from \n13%  to  9.7%,  while  the  PRC\u2019s  increased  from  2.5%  to  7.7%,  and  that  of  the  United  Arab \nEmirates  increased  from  3.4%  to  6.9%.

Exim  Bank  anticipates  a  continued  high  need  for  financing  in  foreign \nexchange (outstanding foreign currency loans constituted 45% of the total loans outstanding as \nof  31  March  2009),  to  accommodate  the  need  for  faster  modernization  of  manufacturing \nprocesses and services.
