Initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken. \nEnvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  have  also  been \nprepared  to  guide  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  during \nimplementation. The summary is in Appendix 12. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of \nurban  residents  and  promote  sustainable,  efficient,  and  responsive \nservice  delivery  in  the  urban  areas  of  Uttarakhand.  The  physical \ninvestments  include  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  systems  for  (i) \nwater  supply, \n(iii)  solid-waste \n(ii)  sanitation  and  sewerage, \nmanagement,  (iv)  roads  and  transport,  and  (v)  slum  upgrading,  in \nabout  31  urban  centers  of  Uttarakhand.  Physical  improvements  are \nthe \ncoupled  with  a  capacity  development  program \nimplementation of the urban governance, finance, and service-delivery \nimprovement action plan, and to strengthen institutional capabilities of \nurban local bodies and other service providers.  \n \nThe  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  extend  financing  for  the  Investment \nProgram through a multitranche financing facility (MFF). The requested \ninfrastructure \nMFF  amounts \ninvestments,  capacity  development,  and  the  expenditures  associated \nwith Investment Program management. \n \nA core objective of the Government\u2019s 10th Five-year Plan (2002\u20132007) \nand  the  Approach  Paper  for  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012)  is \nreducing  interstate  disparities.  Uttarakhand,  as  one  of  the  less-\ndeveloped  states,  is  prioritized  for  investments  in  urban  infrastructure \nto  support  the  growth  of  the  state\u2019s  leading  economic  sectors  of \ntourism  and  industry,  and  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  a  rapidly  growing \nurban  population.  A  major  thrust  of  the  Government\u2019s  urban  policy  is \nthe  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  of  1994  which  promotes \nthe  recently  announced \ndecentralized  urban  governance.  With \nJawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the \nGovernment \nto  sustainable  urban \nits  commitment \ndevelopment  through  linking  capital  investments  to  reforms.  At  the \nstate  level,  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  urban  policy  and  plans \nreiterate those of the national strategies and reflect increasing outlays \non  urban \nthe  Uttarakhand \ngovernment\u2019s  initiation  of  major  urban  reforms  and  the  signing  of  a \n\ninfrastructure.

It  combines  capital  investments  with  support  to  the \nUttarakhand  government\u2019s  urban  reform  action  plan \nto  ensure \nsustainable outcomes. The Investment Program targets selected urban \ncenters which will lead industrial and tourism growth while contributing \nto the reduction of poverty.  \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Investment Program is improved quality of \nlife  for  the  urban  residents  of  Uttarakhand.  The  expected  outcome  is \nincreased access to better quality urban infrastructure and services for \nabout  3.8  million  people  projected  to  be  living  in  Uttarakhand\u2019s  31 \nurban areas by 2016.  \n \nThe estimated total cost of the entire urban infrastructure requirements \nfor \nthe  Uttarakhand  Urban  Sector \nDevelopment  Road  Map  is  around  $1.5  billion,  out  of  which  the \nproposed Investment Program accounts for around $500.0 million. \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nthe  next  10  years  under \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of India \nTotal \n \n\nTotal \n350.0 \n 150.0 \n500.0  \n\n% \n  70 \n  30 \n100 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nAn  MFF  of  $350.0  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB \nwill  be  provided  to  the  Government.  The  first  PFR  amount  is  $60.0 \nmillion.  The  minimum  amount  of  subsequent  PFRs  is  $50.0  million. \nFinal  terms  and  conditions  will  be  determined  in  the  context  of  each \nloan,  and  be  based  on  prevailing  policies  of  ADB.  Financing  made \navailable  under  each  loan  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based facility. The Government has the \noption  to  choose  between  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate \nregime  most  suitable  for  each  loan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in \nterms  of  repayment  and  interest  swaps  during  the  financing  period. \nRepayment schedules can also be structured for each loan, in essence \nto  match  the  needs  of  each  group  of  subprojects  with  their  cost \nrecovery  and  sustainability  profiles.  The  Government  will  onlend  the \namount to the Uttarakhand government on the basis of 90% grant and \n10% loan.   \n \n25 January 2016 (the last periodic financing request submission by 25 \nJanuary 2014) \n \n25 July 2016 \n\n \n\n \n\nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\n(ii) \n\nthe \n\nfor  roads  and \n\nThe  Urban  Development  Department  (UDD)  of  the  Uttarakhand \ngovernment  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Investment \nProgram.  \n \nUDD,  as  the  EA,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  management  and \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  through \nan investment program management unit (IPMU). Investment program \nimplementation units (IPIUs) will be established (i) in Uttarakhand Pey \nJal  Nigam  (the  water  utility)  as  the  implementing  agency  for  water \nthe  Public  Works \nsupply  and  sewerage  component;  and \nDepartment  as \ntraffic \nimplementing  agency \nmanagement  component.  IPIUs  will  be  accountable  to,  and  report  to, \nthe  IPMU.  Urban  local  bodies  will  be  given  a  major  role  in \nthe  solid-waste  management  and  slum  upgrading \nimplementing \ncomponents under the supervision and support of the IPMU. They will \nalso be closely associated with design and implementation of the road \nand transport subprojects.  \n \nAll  goods,  works,  and  services  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended \nInternational  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$10.0  million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $1.0  million  or \nhigher.  The  upper  limit  for  civil  works  and  goods  to  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding procedures will be less than $10.0 \nmillion  and  $1.0  million  respectively.

Program  management  consultants  will  be  appointed  to  support \nthe IPMU in (i) managing, appraising, and packaging subprojects into \ntranches;  (ii)  monitoring  the  implementation;  (iii)  approving  detail \ndesign  and  procurement;  and  (iv)  overseeing \nthe  design  and \nconstruction. Design and supervision consultants will also be recruited \nto  assist \nin  preparing  detailed  design  and  contract \ndocumentation,  and  construction  supervision.  Moreover,  consultants \nwill  be  recruited \nto  design  and  conduct  capacity  development \nprograms.  The  services  of  nongovernment  organizations  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  are  also  likely  to  be  required  to \n(ii)  community-level  solid-waste \nsupport \nmanagement,  (iii)  slum  upgrading,  and  (iv)  monitoring  of  resettlement \nactivities.  It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  about  39  person-months  of \ninternational  consultancy  inputs  and  1,871  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy inputs will be required for program management, detailed \ndesign, and capacity development activities.    \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  benefit  about  3.8  million  people  (the \nestimated  population  of  the  Investment  Program  cities)  by  2016 \nthrough an improved urban environment, with a resulting improvement \nin  the  health,  living  conditions,  and  productivity  of  the  city  residents. \nThe  cities\u2019  economies  will  benefit  from  enhanced  productivity  and \n\n(i)  civic  awareness, \n\n \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  engaged \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nurban  efficiencies  resulting  from  better  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices.  Improved  infrastructure  and  services  will  equip  the  cities  to \nbetter cater to the needs of the industries and tourism which drive the \nUttarakhand economy. All Investment Program interventions will either \ndirectly or indirectly benefit poor people. About 300,000 slum residents \nwill  directly  benefit  from  the  slum  improvement  component.  Further, \nthe  Investment  Program  will  ensure  sustainable  urban  development \nthrough  supporting  urban  reforms  and  capacity  development  for \nimproved  urban  governance,  finance,  and  service  delivery.  The \ncumulative  impact  will  be  reduced  disparities  between  Uttarakhand \nand the rest of India.  \n \nThe  main  risks  are  related  to  Investment  Program  implementation \nperformance  and  the  sustainability  of  investments.  These  include  (i) \nslow Investment Program implementation, which is a common feature \nof urban sector projects; (ii) availability of land for locating assets (e.g., \nlandfill  sites)  and  delays  in  obtaining  land  from  government;  (iii) \ndelayed  actions  on  governance,  finance,  and  the  service-delivery \nimprovement  action  plan;  (iv)  reluctance  in  levying  and  collecting \nincreased  user  charges;  and  (v)  inadequate  public  willingness  to  pay \nfor the services, which presents a risk to sustainability.   \n \nRisks for slow Investment Program implementation will be mitigated by \nestablishing  an  IPMU  and  IPIUs  as  efficient  units  with  qualified  staff \nsupported  by  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  grant-funded \ncomponent  bridging  technical  assistance  for  Project  Implementation \nand Capacity Building Support for Uttarakhand (2007) will also provide \nsupport  to  (i)  familiarize  UDD  and  implementing  agencies  with  ADB \nprocedures, (ii) help in consultant recruitment, and (iii) prepare the first \ntranche subprojects.  \n \nShortage  of  available  land  for  landfill  sites  due  to  the  need  to  protect \nforest  land  will  be  addressed  by  introducing  innovative  systems  such \nas waste minimization at source, composting, and developing common \nlandfill  sites  for  clusters  of  towns.  Delays  in  obtaining  land  from \ngovernment  will  be  minimized  by  (i)  appropriate  sequencing  of \ntranches which involve components and/or subprojects requiring land, \nand (ii) taking actions sufficiently in advance to acquire land.  \n \nImplementation of the urban governance, finance, and service-delivery \nimprovement action plan is not expected to present a great risk due to \nthe reform-minded Uttarakhand government, and the ownership by the \nstate,  ULBs,  and  utilities  of  the  reform  agenda  under  the  JNNURM \nprogram. Civic awareness programs will stimulate demand for utilizing \nimproved  services  and  increase  recognition  of  value  attached  to \nimproved services among urban residents. The capacity development \ncomponent  of  the  Investment  Program  to  be  implemented  under  the \nfirst  tranche  will  further  facilitate  the  implementation  of  envisaged \nreforms.  These  will  be  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s  continued  policy \ndialogue during program implementation.    \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n1. \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Uttarakhand  Urban  Sector  Development \nInvestment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the \nInvestment Program is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES   \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nThe state of Uttarakhand, separated from Uttar Pradesh in 2000, is one of the new and \nrelatively  less-developed  Indian  states,  and,  as  a  result,  is  classified  as  a  \u201cspecial  category\u201d \nstate. It is located on the northern boundary of India, and shares international borders with the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Nepal.  It  has  a  total  land  area  of  53,483  square  kilometers. \nOver  90%  of  the  state\u2019s  terrain  is  hilly  and  62%  is  forested,  limiting  the  availability  of  land  for \nagriculture. The state\u2019s population is 8.48 million (2001). The literacy rate (83%) is much higher \nthan  the  national  average  while  health  indicators  lag  behind  the  average  national  health \nindicators. About 25% (or 2.29 million) of the state\u2019s population live in 63 urban areas. Although \nthe  current  urbanization  rate  is  less  than  the  national  average  (28%),  the  urban  growth  rate \nduring  1991\u20132001  was  more  than  1.5  times  the  growth  rate  of  the  state\u2019s  total  population. \nAccording to official estimates, this rate will be sustained, and by the year 2026 over 37% of the \nUttarakhand  population  will  live  in  urban  areas,  making  it  the  seventh-most  urbanized  state  in \nIndia.  \n \n3. \nWhile  Uttarakhand  suffers  from  growth  constraints  and  limitations  in  agriculture  as  a \nresult of its hilly terrain and high forest coverage, these natural assets, combined with cultural \nand  religious  heritage,  offer  immense  opportunities  for  tourism  development.  The  state  has  a \nrich  cultural  and  natural  landscape,  a  wealth  of  major  shrines  and  spiritual  centers,  and  the \nsources  of  the  Ganga  and  Yamuna  rivers,  which  are  major  tourist  attractions.  Tourism  is \ncurrently  the  mainstay  of  the  economy  and  a  major  source  of  employment.  In  addition  to  its \ntourism potential, the state has a bright outlook for industrial growth owing to its relatively good \nconnectivity  to  other  parts  of  India  and  an  active  pursuit  of  industrial  policy,  and  fiscal  and \nregulatory incentives to attract industry to Uttarakhand. The relative importance of tourism and \nindustry  to  the  economy  are  reflected  in  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  indicators  which \nshow that during the period 1999\u20132004, services (including tourism) accounted for over 40% of \nthe state\u2019s GDP; industry accounted for 26% and agriculture 34%. While the current contribution \nof  agriculture  to  the  state\u2019s  economy  has  been  larger  than  that  of  industry,  the  annual  growth \nrates of industry have been much higher than the agricultural growth rates.   \n \n4. \nWithin this context, the urban centers of Uttarakhand play an increasingly important role \nin the state\u2019s economic transformation. The evidence shows that cities and towns in the plains in \nthe \nsouthern  Uttarakhand  are  rapidly  becoming \nannouncement  of  the  industrial  incentive  policy,  a  large  number  of  industrial  units  are  in  the \nprocess  of  setting,  and  two  large-scale  industrial  estates  have  already  been  set  up  in  the  two \nmajor  cities  of  the  state.  Moreover,  many  towns  (both  in  the  plains  and  the  hills)  are  major \ntourist destinations, or are gateways to other tourism destinations, and so experience significant \nseasonal population increases. Apart from the towns in the plains, a large numbers of hill towns \nhave a special character due to their religious and leisure tourism attractions. In 28 hill towns, \nannual  tourist  numbers  grew  by  17.8%  during  2004\u20132005.  The  prospects  for  the  growth  of \nindustry  and  tourism  in  Uttarakhand  are  therefore  contingent  upon  the  availability  of \ninfrastructure and services which will support this economic growth and cater to the needs of a \nrapidly  growing  population  in  urban  centers.  However,  the  potential  role  that  urban  areas  can \nplay in Uttarakhand\u2019s development is constrained by limited urban infrastructure and services.  \n\nindustry.  Following \n\nlocations  of \n\nthe \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInadequate Urban Infrastructure and Services \n\nindicates \n\nAn  assessment  of  urban \n\ninfrastructure  and  services  conditions \n\nthat \n5. \ninfrastructure  and  services, \nincluding  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  solid-waste \nmanagement, and urban transport and roads, are inadequate in urban areas. About 80% of the \npopulation has access to water supply, with about 78% with house connection and the balance \ndrawing water from public standpipes. Service levels are poor, with water available in the pipes \n2\u20134 hours per day. While the state enjoys abundant water resources, the supply situation in hilly \ntowns away from perennial rivers is critical, especially during the dry season; water supply costs \nare also too high as additional pumping is involved.  \n \n6. \nOnly  20  towns  have  a  centralized  piped  sewer  system  with  coverage  levels  ranging \nbetween  30%  and  75%.  Of  these  towns  served  by  piped  sewers,  only  two  have  a  sewerage \ntreatment  facility.  Most  waste  water  is  co-disposed  with  storm  water  and  thence  into  natural \nwater  courses,  presenting  severe  environmental  and  health  risk.  Less  than  50%  of  the  solid \nwaste  generated  is  collected.  The  solid  waste  collected  is  generally  disposed  to  open  land, \ndrains,  and  hill  slopes  in  the  absence  of  sanitary  landfill  sites.  Solid-waste  equipment  and \nvehicles  are  inadequate.  The  problem  is  compounded  during  the  tourist  season  when  the \namount of solid waste significantly increases.   \n \n 7. \nUrban roads are in poor condition; road networks and parking spaces are insufficient to \nmeet the demands of current and future traffic volumes, given that traffic volumes have doubled \nin  the  last  10  years  and  are  projected  to  do  so  again  in  the  next  10  years.  Narrow  roads, \ncoupled with poor traffic management, lead to congestion with subsequent inefficiency in urban \nmobility,  air  pollution,  and  risk  to  public  safety.  Due  to  favorable  topography,  the  incidence  of \nflooding is generally minimal, with the exception of some towns which have localized problems.  \n \n\n2. \n\nUrban Governance, Management, Service Delivery, and Finance \n\nUrban  Governance,  Management,  and  Service  Delivery.  The  low  performance  in \n8. \ninfrastructure  development  and  service  delivery  in  the  urban  centers  of  Uttarakhand  largely \nstems  from  inadequate  urban  institutional,  financial,  and  service-delivery  frameworks  and \ncapacities.  Primary  responsibility  for  providing  urban  infrastructure  and  services  (except  for \nwater  supply  and  sewerage),  including  on-site  sanitation,  solid-waste  management,  drainage, \nroad maintenance, street lighting, and slum improvement, lies with urban local bodies (ULBs). \nHowever,  ULBs  cannot  perform  their  duties  effectively  as  they  lack  required  organizational \ncapacities  and  operational  and  management  skills.  More  importantly,  financial  resources \nobtained through urban-based taxes and user charges are insufficient to fund the tasks of urban \nservice delivery. \n \n9. \nWater supply and sewerage (WSS) service provision is the responsibility of state water \nutilities, i.e., Uttarakhand Pey Jal Nigam (UPJN) for capital works and Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan \n(UJS)  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  which  operate  under  the  Drinking  Water \nDepartment  (DDW).  The  issues  contributing  to  the  poor  performance  in  WSS  service  delivery \nare  (i)  overlapping  functioning  of  the  two  utilities,  despite  their  intended  distinct  mandates;  (ii) \nlack  of  separation  of  policy,  regulation,  and  service  delivery;  (iii)  lack  of  separation  of \norganization  and  finances  of  rural  and  urban  water  supply;  and  (iv)  inadequate  inclusion  of \nULBs and UJS in planning of water supply programs by UPJN (i.e, a supply-driven approach). \nThe sustainability of WSS is further compromised by operational inefficiencies and inadequate \ntariffs. Unaccounted-for water is reported to be 30\u201350%, but is likely to be considerably higher. \nMetering  is  nonexistent  for  domestic  users.  There  is  need  for  (i)  a  higher  degree  of \naccountability,  (ii)  clear  division  of  labor  between  UPJN  and  UJS,  (iii)  ring-fencing  of  urban \nWSS,  (iv)  improving  capacities  and  skills  in  utilities,  (v)  rationalizing  user  charges,  and  (vi)  an \nincentive structure to improve WSS service delivery. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nfor  primary  collection  of  solid  waste \n\n10. \nUrban and Municipal Finance. ULBs largely depend on grants and aid from the state to \nfinance establishment and development expenditures. Currently, ULBs generate an average of \n26% and UJS generates 35% of their total revenues. Despite the high levels of state support, in \nmany cases the total income is not sufficient to meet the salary and establishment costs. The \ncurrent  revenue  base  is  low,  and  there  are  no  matching  sources  of  funds  for  some  ULB \nfunctions (such as road maintenance). Property tax, a major source of local revenue, falls short \nof its full potential due to inadequate assessment, incomplete coverage of the tax net, and low \ncollection  efficiencies.  In  addition,  the  task  of  meeting  the  service  needs  of  a  large  seasonal \ntourist  population  places  an  additional  financial  burden  on  ULBs.  ULBs  currently  do  not  have \ncredible  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems  to  efficiently  manage  their  resources, \nalthough steps are being taken to remedy this.  \n \n11. \nPrivate Sector Participation (PSP). The Uttarakhand government has achieved some \ngood  practices  in  PSP  through  build-operate-transfer  arrangements  for  the  Interstate  Bus \nTerminal at Dehradun owing to the potential of buoyant and rapidly increasing user fees for the \nbus  terminal.  However,  this  does  not  appear  to  be  readily  applicable  to  all  other  urban \nsubsectors.  The  experience  with  PSP  in  other  urban  subsectors  is  limited  only  to  short-term \nthrough  combining  community \nservice  contracts \nparticipation  (through  mahalla-neighborhood  committees)  with  PSP.  PSP  on  a  larger  scale  is \nconstrained  by  (i)  inadequate  cost  recovery,  (ii)  low  levels  of  institutional  capacity  to  regulate \nand manage participation of the private sector, (iii) challenges posed by the state\u2019s terrain, and \n(iv) the consequent reluctance by the private sector to take the perceived distribution-end risks \nassociated with urban infrastructure. However, getting the private sector to take on responsibility \nfor  design,  construction,  and  operation  through  design-build-operate  or  a  performance-based \ndeferred payment system contract is feasible,  as revenue risks are borne by the public sector \nunder such arrangements. The best value for this kind of public-private partnership (PPP) is to \nbe gained from injecting the managerial and technical skills and efficiencies of the private sector \ninto urban infrastructure development and service delivery. \n  \nthe \nUttarakhand  Government\u2019s  Urban  Reform  Orientation.  Notwithstanding \n12. \ninadequate  urban  institutional  and  financial  frameworks,  the  Uttarakhand  government  has \nimplemented  a  number  of  sector  reform  initiatives,  demonstrating  its  reform  orientation. \nSignificant among these initiatives are (i) the preparation of a Municipal Bill which provides for \ngreater devolution to, and empowerment of, ULBs in line with the 74th Constitution Amendment \nAct (CAA); (ii) constitution of the Second State Finance Commission to strengthen state\u2013urban \nlocal body relationships; (iii) repeal of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and reform of the Rent Control \nAct,  both  of  which  will  enable  land  and  housing  markets  to  work  more  efficiently;  (iv)  a  wide \nrange  of  e-governance  and  information  technology  tools  for  use  by  ULBs  to  enhance  good \ngovernance  practices  and  improve  urban  planning,  management  capacities,  property  taxation, \nand the interface with the public; and (v) issuance of a government order to introduce double-\nentry accrual accounting. More importantly, in May 2007, under the Jawaharlal Nehru National \nUrban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the  Uttarakhand  government  and  its  three  major  cities  of \nDehradun,  Haridwar,  and  Nainital,  signed  a  memorandum  of  agreement  with  the  Ministry  of \nUrban Development, demonstrating their commitment to a wide range of state- and local-level \nurban  reforms.  These  commitments  include  (i)  empowering  and  strengthening  ULBs,  (ii) \nimproving financial management and accounting of ULBs and utilities, (iii) increasing revenues \nthrough  property  tax  reform  and  rationalization  of  user  charges,  and  (iv)  restructuring  utilities \nand incorporating private-sector efficiencies and accountabilities into service delivery.  \n \n\n \n3. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\n13. \nExternal  Assistance.  To  date,  Uttarakhand  has  not  received  any  significant  external \nassistance  for  urban  development.  Limited  capacity-building  support  has  previously  been \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nprovided  by  other  donors,  including  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP). \nCurrently  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  is  supporting  an \ninitiative  to  develop  e-governance  at  the  state  and  ULB  levels  through  its  Financial  Institution \nReform  and  Expansion  program.1  Also  related  to,  or  impacting  on,  the  urban  sector  in \nUttarakhand are ADB\u2019s loan for the state roads project2 and the World Bank assistance for the \nrural water supply and sanitation program.3  \n  \n14. \nThe proposed Investment Program will be the first ADB urban-sector lending assistance \nin Uttarakhand. ADB has provided 31 technical assistance grants totaling $17.0 million to India\u2019s \nurban  sector  since  1993,  and  has  approved  loans  for  12  projects  totaling  $2.9  billion.  The \nstrategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance has been poverty reduction through shared growth, social \ndevelopment, and good governance. These objectives have been translated into actions, mostly \nby integrated urban infrastructure and services projects. Recently, growing interstate disparities \nin  India  have  become  a  concern  for  ADB  and  the  Government  in  the  context  of  the  common \ncore  objectives  of  redressing  regional  imbalances  and  inclusive  growth.  ADB  made  a \ncommitment to diversify its operations to the northern states. Uttarakhand has been identified as \none  of  the  geographic  areas  of  priority  for  ADB  assistance.  ADB  has  provided  a  project \npreparatory  TA  to  support  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  efforts  for  preparing  this  Investment \nProgram.  ADB  has  also  approved  recently  a  component  bridging  TA4  to  enhance  the  project \npreparedness and capacity of executing and implementing agencies to manage and implement \nthe proposed Investment Program. The details of external support to India\u2019s urban sector are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n15. \nLessons Learned. ADB\u2019s past experience in the urban sector in India reveals the issues \nof  (i)  the  inherently  complex  nature  of  urban  development  projects  which  require  great \ncoordination  among  concerned  agencies  and  strong  project  management  and  implementation \ncapacities;  (ii)  delays  in  project  implementation,  especially  during  project  start  up,  and  (iii) \nsustainability  of  project  assets.  The  experience  suggests  that  advance  support  for  building \ncapacities for project management and implementation has the potential to avoid start-up delays \nand increase effective project implementation. The experience also implies that greater care is \nneeded to ensure sustainability through (i) greater involvement and ownership of stakeholders \nduring project design; (ii) phasing urban reforms commensurate with institutional capacities over \nrealistic periods; (iii) long-term capacity development of ULBs and other urban service providers \nin  planning,  managing,  and  financing  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  and  (iv)  introducing \nincentive  and  greater  accountability  structures  into  urban  service-delivery  systems.  All  these \nlessons have been incorporated into the design of the Investment Program.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRationale: Uttarakhand Urban Sector Road Map \n\n16. \nSince  the  late  1980s,  the  Government  has  attached  growing  importance  to  urban \ndevelopment, as shown by various policy efforts, including the setting up of the National Urban \nCommission, formulation of the National Urban Policy, the  74th CAA, the 10th Five-Year Plan \nand  Approach  Paper  for  the  11th  plan,  and  the  launching  of  the  JNNURM  in  2005  with  a \nmassive urban investment program. The Government, in its 10th and 11th plans, has also made \na commitment to higher levels of investments in less-developed states, including Uttarakhand. \nThe  importance  of  Uttarakhand  and  its  urban  sector  in  the  national  scene  has  been  further \nhighlighted by the inclusion of Dehradun, Haridwar, and Nainital in a list of 63 cities eligible for \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Technical  Assistance  Cluster  to  India  for \nProject Processing and Capacity Development, Manila [TA 4814-IND]).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nfunding  under  the  JNNURM.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  developing  urban \ninfrastructure is the key to realizing the planned growth for the state\u2019s economy.  \n \n17. \nBoth  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  and  the  Approach  Paper  for  11th  plan  stress  the \nimportance  of  the  quality  of  governance  and  service-delivery  systems  for  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment. A fundamental point of reference in these plans is the 74th CAA, which promotes \ndevolution of responsibility to, and empowerment of, ULBs so that they can play a pivotal role in \nurban management. With the launch of the JNNURM, the Government reaffirms its commitment \nto  sustainable  urban  development  through  reform-linked  investments.  The  JNNURM  aims  to \nfast-track  infrastructure  investments  in  63  cities,  subject  to  their  commitment  to  a  range  of \nreforms. The envisaged reforms focus on decentralized governance and municipal finance. The \nJNNURM  also  advocates  (i)  balancing  asset  creation  with  maintenance,  (ii)  PSP  in  service \ndelivery, and (iii) financially sustainable service providers for WSS. \n \nAt the state level, the Uttarakhand government\u2019s urban policy objectives reiterate those \n18. \nof the central government, combining high-growth strategies with poverty reduction, building on \nareas  of  strategic  importance,  including  urban  infrastructure  and  institutional  development. \nBeing  a  new  state,  Uttarakhand  does  not  have  a  history  of  urban  focus;  however,  budget \nallocations  of  recent  years  reflect  an  increasing  outlay  on  urban  infrastructure,  with  capital \nexpenditure  increasing  from  33%  in  2003\u20132004  to  44%  in  2005\u20132006.  More  importantly,  the \nUttarakhand  government\u2019s  initiation  of  a  number  of  urban  reforms,  and  the  signing  of  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Government  to  implement  further  reforms  under  the \nJNNURM, amply establishes the Uttarakhand government\u2019s commitment not only to developing \nphysical infrastructure assets but also to sustainable urban service delivery.  \n \n19. \nVision. The Uttarakhand Urban Sector Road Map has been guided by the above urban \npolicy  framework.  The  road  map  aims  to  provide  critically  needed  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices, leading to a better quality of life for the estimated 4.05 million people projected to be \nliving  in  the  31  program  towns  by  2018.  It  combines  capital  investments  with  support  to  the \nUttarakhand government\u2019s urban reform agenda to ensure sustainable outcomes. The road map \ntargets selected urban centers which will lead industrial and tourism growth while contributing to \nthe reduction of poverty. The Investment Program to be financed by ADB will meet the priority \ninvestment  and capacity development needs and pave the way to attainment of the vision set \nout for the Uttarakhand urban areas. The road map is presented as Schedule 1 to the Financing \nFramework Agreement (FFA). \n \n20. \nTen-Year  Infrastructure  Investment  Plan.  It  is  estimated  that  about  $1.5  billion  is \nrequired  in  the  next  10  years  to  meet  the  infrastructure  requirements  of  about  31  towns  in \nUttarakhand. Investments include water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid-waste management, \nroads  and  transport,  slum  improvement,  and  urban  renewal.  The  10-year  infrastructure \ninvestment  plan  is  based  on  (i)  central  and  state  government  policy,  plans,  and  targets  for \ninfrastructure; (ii) city development plans for three cities, and town reports for six representative \ntowns, providing in-depth demographic, spatial, infrastructure, and institutional analyses and city \ninvestment  plans;  (iii)  city  growth  strategies  and  land-use  master  plans;  (iv)  available \ninfrastructure  master  plans;  (v)  consultations  with  stakeholders;  (vi)  surveys  profiling \ninfrastructure  deficiencies  and  gaps  in  service  performances;  and  (vii)  financing  needs  for \ninfrastructure over the next 10 years. It is envisaged that funding requirements for the 10-year \nplan  will  be  met  by  different  sources,  e.g.,  the  state  budget,  the  JNNURM,  and  the  Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Scheme  for  Small  and  Medium  Towns.  A  large  portion  of  the \nfunding requirement is expected to be met by the JNNURM. The proposed Investment Program \nforms a part of the 10-year investment plan.  \n \n21. \nUrban Reform Agenda. In parallel with improving urban infrastructure, the Uttarakhand \ngovernment  under  its  road  map  sets  a  vision  for  enhancing  urban  governance,  finance,  and \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthrough \n\nservice  delivery  in  line  with  its  agreement  to  implement  JNNURM  reforms.  The  urban \ngovernance,  finance,  and  service-delivery  improvement  action  plan,  which  is  presented  in \nAppendix  3,  is  grouped  into  three  major  interrelated  areas.  The  first  major  area  of  reform  is \npromoting  decentralized  urban  governance \nthe  gradual  empowerment  and \nenhancement of the capacities of ULBs in urban planning and management.   \n \n22. \nThe second area of reform is the restructuring of utilities for efficient, accountable, and \nfinancially  sustainable  WSS  service  provision  within  the  decentralization  framework.  This \ninvolves  (i)  the  separation  of  policy,  regulation, and  service  delivery  at  the  state  level,  starting \nwith a small regulatory unit within the Uttarakhand government; (ii) bringing clarity to the current \nconfusing roles of UPJN and UJS; (iii) separating urban and rural water supply by ring-fencing \nof urban WSS with regard to labor, financing, and accounting; (iv) developing a participatory and \nprofessional  governance  structure  within  UPJN  and  UJS  with  greater  ULB  representation  and \nco-opting  of  experts;  and  (v)  injecting  an  accountability  and  incentive  mechanism  through  a \nperformance-based  contractual  relationship  among  UJS  as  service  provider,  ULBs  as  ultimate \nowners, and the state (provider of grant and subsidies), with predefined targets for improvement \nin unaccounted-for water, billing, the collection of (and gradual increase in) user charges, and \nreducing  subsidies.  In  the  medium  term,  as  devolution  progresses  with  stronger  ULBs,  this \ntripartite contractual relationship will evolve into a contract between ULBs and UJS, with ULBs \nhaving full oversight of the WSS delivered by service provider (UJS and/or the private sector). \nAppendix 4 describes in detail the improvements for sustainable and accountable WSS.  \n \n23. \nThe third area of reform relates to improving revenues and financial management. This \ninvolves rationalization of user charges to gradually recover the full operation and maintenance \ncosts  through  the  gradual  increase  in  water  tariffs  and  implementing  (i)  a  volumetric  water \ncharge, (ii) a sewerage surcharge on the water bill, and (iii) a solid-waste management charge. \nThe  revenue  generation  reforms  also  include  increasing  property  tax  revenues  through \nincreasing tax coverage, changing the method of tax assessment and improving tax collection \nefficiencies.  Moreover,  reforms  envisage  gradual  development  of  new  sources  of  revenue  for \nthe maintenance of urban roads. These are supported by financial management reforms for the \nadoption of accrual-based double-entry accounting in ULBs and utilities, and the introduction of \ne-governance systems. The Uttarakhand government recognizes that these reforms also set the \nstage for increased PSP in urban infrastructure provision.   \n     \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nA. \n \nThe  anticipated  impact of  the  Investment  Program  is  an improved  quality  of  life  for the \n24. \nurban residents of Uttarakhand. The expected outcome of the Investment Program is increased \naccess to better quality urban infrastructure and services by the 3.8 million people projected to \nbe living within the 31 Program towns by 2016. It is also expected that the Investment Program \nwill enhance the quality of services and experience enjoyed by more than 8 million tourists and \npilgrims who visit the Program towns annually.   \n \nB. \n \n25. \nTo achieve the intended impact and outcomes, the Investment Program comprises two \nmajor  interrelated  areas  of  interventions.  Part  A  covers  urban  infrastructure  and  services \nimprovements  including  the  rehabilitation,  improvement,  and  expansion  of  (i)  water  supply,  (ii) \nsewerage and sanitation, (iii) solid-waste management, (iv) urban transportation and roads, and \n(v)  slum  upgrading.  Part  B  covers  (i)  Investment  Program  management  support,  and  (ii)  a \ncomprehensive  program  of  capacity  development  to  assist  in  the  attainment  of  the  urban \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ngovernance,  finance,  and  service-delivery  improvement  action  plan  and  to  enhance  the \ncapacities of the urban service providers, including ULBs. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Urban Infrastructure and Services Improvements  \n\n26.  Water  Supply.  Investments  are  aimed  at  improving  both  the  quantity  and  quality  of \nwater  supply  to  national  and  state  standards  through  (i)  improving  information  on  existing \nnetworks; (ii) reducing unaccounted-for water through leak detection, system rehabilitation and \nrepair,  and  reducing  illegal  connections;  (iii)  system  rationalization  and  optimization  (e.g., \nreplacement  of  bunched  connections);  (iv)  provision  of  bulk  and  consumer  meters  and  other \nsystem \nimprovements;  and  (v)  where  necessary,  augmenting  supplies  and  extending \ndistribution  networks.  This  will  enable  83%  coverage  to  be  achieved  by  the  end  of  the \nInvestment  Program  period  of  2016,  with  a  majority  of  households  receiving  potable  water  24 \nhours  a  day.  These  investments  will  be  accompanied  by  civic  awareness  campaigns  and \ncapacity development to support WSS reforms for sustainable service delivery under Part B. \n \n27.  Wastewater  Management.  Investments  are  aimed  at  improving  the  environmental \nquality of urban areas and receiving water bodies, with a consequent impact on public health. \nImprovements are targeted, by end of 2016, at providing collection and treatment of sewage by \nappropriate technology and extending service coverage to an average of 60% with 50\u201390% in \nthe  larger  towns  and  30-50%  in  medium-size  towns.  In  smaller  towns,  on-site  sanitation \nimprovements will generally be undertaken. The sewer networks will mostly cover the town core \narea;  on  the  outskirts  of  towns,  where  extending  networks  would  not  be  economical  due  to \nscattered  habitation  or  geographical  constraints,  on-site  sanitation  will  be  provided.  The \ntechnology  options  will  follow  the  particular  geographical  and  climatic  features  of  the  town  as \nwell  as  quantity  of  sewage  load.  Investments  will  be  accompanied  by  public  awareness \ncampaigns and capacity development to ensure system sustainability under Part B. \n  \n28. \nSolid-Waste  Management.  Investments  are  aimed  at  improving  public  health  and  the \nenvironmental  quality  of  Program  towns  and  adjacent  open  land  and  water  bodies  through \nincreasing solid-waste collection coverage from 50% to 72%, and supporting sound solid-waste \ndisposal methods. Improvements will be directed at (i) segregation of solid waste at household \nlevel and handling and management improvements at ward and town levels with an emphasis \non waste minimization, (ii) provision of solid-waste collection and transportation equipment, and \n(iii)  construction  of  sanitary  landfill  sites  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  Municipal  Solid \nWaste  Management  and  Handling  Rules,  2000.  These  will  build  on  a  state  solid-waste \nmanagement strategy and action plan, and will be supported by capacity development of ULBs \nunder Part B.    \n \n29. \nUrban  Transport  and  Roads.  Interventions  will  aim  at  improving  traffic  conditions, \nreducing  journey  times,  and  improving  the  safety  of  all  users,  particularly  the  most  vulnerable \n(pedestrians,  cyclists,  and  motorcyclists),  through  a  combination  of  investments.  These \ninvestments  will  generally  focus  on  major  roads  and  will  include  (i)  road  widening  and \nstrengthening to create greater road capacity, thus relieving congestion and easing traffic flows; \n(ii) car parking restrictions and the provision of multistory car parks and bus and truck terminals, \nwhere possible through PSP, to enhance passenger convenience and increase road space; (iii) \nprovision of pedestrian subways and footpaths to improve pedestrian movement and safety; (iv) \ntraffic  management  improvements;  and  (v)  street  lighting  for  improved  traffic  and  pedestrian \nsafety. \n \n30. \nSlum  Improvement.  Interventions  will  include  the  provision  of  bulk  water  supply  and \nsewerage  mains  at  the  entry  to  slum  areas,  and  improvements  to  solid-waste  management, \naccess roads, street lighting, and drainage in poor communities and slums, which accommodate \naround 300,000 poor people, accounting for about half of the slum population in the state. The \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nselection, approach, and strategic responses to the broader issues of slum population and poor \ncommunities will be based on a state slum upgrading strategy to be developed at the outset of \nthe  Investment  Program  under  part  B.  A  demand-led  approach  to  developing  community-level \ninfrastructure  and  services  will  be  followed.  Slum  upgrading  subprojects  will  be  generated \nthrough  a  participatory  planning  process  by  communities  with  the  assistance  of  community-\nbased  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  applicable.  Support  will  be \nprovided  to  ULBs  and  communities  for  effective  joint  functioning  in  developing,  implementing, \nand  sustaining  community-based  urban  upgrading  schemes.  The  component  will  benefit  from, \nand  build  on,  existing  community-based  organizations\u2019  efforts  and \nthe  Uttarakhand \ngovernment\u2019s poverty reduction schemes. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart  B:  Capacity  Development  and  Investment  Program  Management \nSupport \n\nCapacity  Development.  Assistance  will  support  the  attainment  of  the  Uttarakhand \n31. \ngovernment\u2019s  urban  governance,  finance,  and  service-delivery  improvement  action  plan  and \nrelated institutional development needs. Support will be provided to the state, ULBs, and utilities \nin (i) furthering decentralized urban governance, (ii) sustainable WSS service delivery, and (iii) \nurban  and  municipal  finance  reforms,  including  PSP  in  urban  infrastructure  and  service \nprovision.  \n \n32. \nSupport  for  decentralized  urban  governance  will  prepare  ULBs  for  their  increased \nresponsibilities under the Uttarakhand government\u2019s devolution policy. Feasible action plans will \nbe  developed  to  gradually  devolve  functions  to  ULBs,  and  commensurate  organizational \ndevelopment.  Priority  will  be  given  to  enhancing  the  capacities  of  ULBs  in  asset  management \nand  O&M  of  services  for  which  they  are  currently  responsible,  such  as  solid-waste \nmanagement.  \n \n33. \nThe  capacity-development  component  will  support  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  road \nmap  for  efficient,  financially  sustainable,  and  accountable WSS  service  delivery.  Expert  inputs \nwill  be  provided  to  conduct  institutional  surveys  and  develop  and  assist implementing  detailed \nproposals  and  action  plans  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  to  (i)  separate  regulation  and \nservice-delivery  functions;  (ii)  remove  the  overlaps  in  the  functioning  of  UPJN  and  UJS;  (iii) \ndevelop  measures  for  involvement  of  ULBs  in  planning  and  provision  of  WSS;  (iv)  establish \nclear  accountabilities  between  service  provider,  ULBs,  and  the  state;  and  (v)  introduce \nimprovements into the governance structure and the organizational and operational systems of \nUJS, including in asset management, financial management systems, and staff skills.  \n \nThis  component  will  also  support  the  improvement  of  local  revenues  and  financial \n34. \nmanagement. Assistance will be given in the restructuring of water tariffs to consumption-based \nvolumetric  tariffs,  introduction  of  a  sewerage  surcharge  and  solid-waste  management  charge, \nand  achievement  of  the  cost-recovery  targets.  Assistance  will  also  be  directed  at  increasing \nproperty tax revenues through increasing tax coverage, revising the method of tax assessment, \nand improving tax collection efficiencies. Moreover, the component will assist ULBs and water \nutilities \nincluding \npreparation of manuals, installation of computerized systems, and training of staff of utilities and \nULBs.   \n \n35. \nAnother  area  of  assistance  under  this  component  will  be  promoting  PSP  in  urban \ninfrastructure development in accordance with Uttarakhand government policy. Support will be \nprovided to (i) create an enabling framework,  (ii) transfer knowledge and skills and strengthen \ncapacities  in  planning  and  managing  PSP,  and  (iii)  identify  suitable  components  and  develop \nPPP schemes.  \n \n\nimplement  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting, \n\nintroduce  and \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n36. \nThis  component  will  also  fund  several  key  studies  to  provide  a  planned  approach  to \nfuture investments. A slum strategy study will develop (i) slum mapping; (ii) different typology of \nslums;  (iii)  criteria  under  which  upgrading,  reblocking,  or  redevelopment  can  take  place;  (iv) \napproaches to slum upgrading; and (v) a costed action plan for slum upgrading. The solid-waste \nmanagement study will develop a strategy and action plan for collection, treatment, and disposal \nof  solid  waste,  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  Municipal  Solid  Waste  Management  Rules  and \nconsidering  the  role  of  public,  private,  and  community  sectors,  the  state\u2019s  fragile  natural \nenvironment and various settings (hills, foothills, and plains areas) which require innovative and \ndistinct approaches to solid-waste management.  \n \nInvestment  Program  Management.  This  component  supports  funding  the  costs  of \n37. \nInvestment Program management and implementation, including incremental administration and \noperations  associated  with  the  investment  program  management  unit  (IPMU)  in  the  Urban \nDevelopment Department (UDD), the IPIUs in UPJN, the Public Works Department (PWD), and \nULBs,  and  provision  of  equipment,  logistics,  and  consulting  services  to  assist  the  IPMU  and \nIPIUs. \n \n38. \nConsultancy  support  will  also  include  (i)  on-the-job  training  to  build  the  capacity  of  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  in  project  management  and  implementation  (technical, \nenvironmental  and  social  aspects,  and  planning  and  monitoring);  and  (ii)  assistance  to  ULBs \nand utilities for effective O&M of the Investment Program assets.  \n \nThis  component  will  also  include  a  program  of  community  participation  and  civic \n39. \nawareness  activities.  An  area  of  focus  will  be  awareness  raising  on  the  public\u2019s  role  in,  and \nresponsibility  for,  good  environmental  practices  in  solid-waste  management.  Activities  will \ninclude  promoting  participation  of  urban  residents  (including  women  and  the  poor)  in  the \nProgram,  e.g.,  subproject  preparation,  construction,  and  monitoring  activities.  Services  of \nNGOs, training, and equipment will be provided to help carry out these activities. \n  \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n40. \nPlanned  and  Integrated  Approach  to  City  Development.  The  design  of  the \nInvestment Program follows a planned approach. The identification of the long-term investment \nrequirements and the design of the Investment Program and subprojects are based on growth \nstrategies,  city  development  and  land-use  plans,  town  development  reports,  and infrastructure \nmaster plans. The Investment Program is also based on the principle of the integrated provision \nof  various  urban  infrastructure  and  services  to  maximize  the  benefits  from  individual  sector \nimprovements.  \n \n41. \nSupport to Reforms for Urban Governance, Finance, Service Delivery, and Private \nSector  Participation.  An  important  feature  of  the  Investment  Program  is  its  support  to  the \nUttarakhand  government\u2019s  urban  reform  action  plan  for  efficient,  sustainable,  inclusive,  and \naccountable service delivery. This is to be achieved through supporting (i) the decentralization \nagenda  of  the  Uttarakhand  government  and  strengthening  the  capacities  of  ULBs;  (ii) \ndevelopment  of  efficient,  accountable,  and  sustainable  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  creating \nsustainable sources of revenue through rationalization of service charges and taxes.  \n \nIt  is  envisaged  that  the  above  reforms  will  also  significantly  contribute  to  creating  an \n42. \nenabling  environment  for  PSP.  In  addition,  dedicated  efforts  will  be  made  to  develop  specific \nPPP  packages  under  the  Investment  Program.  Both  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  and  during  loan  fact-finding,  extensive  assessment  and  dialogue  with  government \nand  private-sector  representatives  was  conducted  on  viable  options  for  PSP  in  urban \ninfrastructure development in Uttarakhand. In addition to short-term service contracts, there are \nparticular  opportunities  for  PPP  arrangements  to  bring  service  efficiencies  in  parking  facilities, \nsolid-waste  management,  water  supply,  and  wastewater  management.  The  Uttarakhand \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ngovernment  has  indicated  its  interest  in  extending  the  defect  liability  period  in  its  engineering \nprocurement  contracts  from  the  current  1  year  to  5  years.  This  type  of  arrangement  would \nensure  that  private  operators  take  responsibility  for  the  performance  of  their  technology  and \nmanagement.  Appropriate  PPP  packages  will  be  further  developed  for  suitable  subprojects  at \nthe outset of the Investment Program (Supplementary Appendix A) in coordination with ADB\u2019s \nongoing TA project.5  \n \n43. \nInclusive  Urban  Growth.  The  Investment  Program  will  include  measures  for  inclusive \nurban  development  through  (i)  supporting  the  development  of  a  statewide  slum  strategy  to \nintegrate the urban poor into urban development, (ii) targeted interventions in the form of a slum \nupgrading component which will address the basic needs of urban poor communities building on \na state slum strategy, and (iii) address the affordability constraints of the poor through measures \nsuch as lifeline tariffs and free service connections for poor people.  \n \nBridging  Technical  Assistance.  The  Investment  Program  is  supported  by  a  grant-\n44. \nfunded bridging TA based on the experience of ADB with previous urban sector projects in India \nwhich  show  significant  delay  in  commencement  of  actual  fieldwork  after  the  loan  becomes \neffective. The component bridging TA (see footnote 4) therefore aims to avoid start-up delays by \nenhancing  the  preparedness  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  implement  the \nforthcoming Investment Program. The component bridging TA, which commenced in June 2007, \nwill assist UDD, as the Executing Agency (EA) , with (i) familiarizing itself with ADB procedures, \n(ii) the preparation of various documents (such as standard bidding documents), (iii) undertaking \nadvance  action  for  recruitment  of  program  management  consultants,  and  (iv)  conducting \nsurveys and mapping to accelerate detailed design of first tranche subprojects.  \n  \n45.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  The  Investment  Program  will  be  an  MFF.  The \nrationale for designing the Investment Program as an MFF is derived from the broad agenda of \nthe road map, which involves provision of urban infrastructure and services in around 31 cities \nand  towns  with  varying  levels  of  needs  and  capacities.  The  MFF  will  enable  flexibility  in \ninvestment  decisions  based  on  the  needs  and  constraints  of  each  city  within  a  framework \ninstead  of  an  upfront  and  precise  definition  of  investments  as  required  in  a  conventional \nassistance modality. It will allow the implementation to be based on the readiness of individual \nsubprojects and cities, as under the MFF funds will be made available to the state in a phased \nmanner  subject  to  readiness  of  appropriate  subprojects.  The  use  of  an  MFF  will  enable  ADB \nand  the  Uttarakhand  government  to  develop  a  long-term  partnership  for  developing  the  urban \nareas  of  Uttarakhand  in  a  sustainable  manner.  It  will  allow  long-term  engagement  for  building \nthe capacities of urban institutions and reform actions within a realistic time frame. Finally, the \nuse  of  an  MFF  will  provide  flexibility  to  match  various  funding  sources available  to  the  central \nand state governments. \n \nD. \n \n46. \nThe  cost  of  the  entire  urban  sector  investment  plan  for  Uttarakhand\u2019s  31  towns  for  the \nnext 10-year period is estimated at $1.5 billion (see para. 20) of which the estimated cost of the \nInvestment Program is $500.0 million (as summarized in Table 1).  \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2006.

The financing will be \nprovided  as  an  MFF  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy.6  The  MFF  will  extend  multiple  loans  to \nfinance  a  range  of  appropriate  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to \nsubmission of a related periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of \nthe related loan and project agreements. The Government will enter into an FFA with ADB. The \nFFA, outlining the specific terms and conditions under which succeeding tranches will be made \nas well as the first PFR in an amount of $60 million of ADB loan and a total cost of $85.7 million, \nare  attached  as  an  annex  to  this  report.

An \nIPMU has already been established in UDD to manage and monitor the implementation of the \nInvestment  Program,  and  provide  policy  direction.  The  IPMU  is  envisaged  to  be  registered \nunder  the  Societies  Registration  Act  The  registration  of  the  IPMU  as  a  society  will  enable  (i) \nefficient functioning without strictly relying on prior permission of the Uttarakhand government in \nday-to-day  business  and  decision  making,  (ii)  efficient  disbursement  and  prompt  payment  of \nfunds  to  contractors  and  suppliers,  and  (iii)  engagement  of  qualified  staff  and  outsourcing  the \nservices  of  professionals  as  needed.  The  IPMU  will  have  a  charter  or  constitution  that  will  be \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \nThe IPMU will have a general body consisting of the chief secretary as its chair and the \n50. \nsecretaries of  the  relevant  Uttarakhand  government  departments  and  representatives  of  ULBs \nand  NGOs  as  its  members  to  provide  policy  guidance  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program  There  will  also  be  an  executive  committee  chaired  by  the  urban \ndevelopment  secretary,  and  consisting  of  high-level  officials  of  the  state  departments  of \nFinance,  DDW  and  Public  Works,  and  relevant  ULBs.  The  executive  committee  will  meet  at \nleast  quarterly  to  review  Program  performance,  and  decide  on  all  major  issues  of  Program \nmanagement. More specifically, the duties of the executive committee will include (i) providing \nstrategic guidance and oversight of the implementation of the Investment Program, including the \nurban  reform  action  plan;  (ii)  approving  subprojects  and  PFRs;  (iii)  ratification  of  the  annual \nbudget  estimates;  (iv)  the  creation  of  posts  and  recruitment  of  staff;  (v)  ratification  of \nprocurement  of  services,  works,  and  goods,  and  approval  of  disbursements;  and  (vi)  ensuring \ncompliance with safeguards and acquisition of land and other similar matters. \n \n51. \nThe Uttarakhand government has already appointed the investment program director of \nthe IPMU. The program director, with a team of administrative, financial, technical, social, and \nenvironmental  staff  drawn  from  various  relevant  departments  and  utilities,  will  be  exclusively \nresponsible for  executing,  managing,  and  supervising  Program  implementation.  The  IPMU  will \n(i)  engage  UPJN  as  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  for  the  water  supply  and  sewerage \ncomponent, (ii) engage PWD as the IA for the roads and traffic management component, and \n(iii) set up IPIUs (accountable to the IPMU) in each of the agencies. ULBs will be given a major \nrole  in  implementing  the  solid-waste  management  and  slum  upgrading  components  under  the \nsupervision  and  support  of  the  IPMU  through  a  special  cell  within  it.  They  will  also  be  closely \nassociated  with  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  road  and  traffic  management \nprojects.  \n \n52. \nThe  IPMU,  under  the  overall  guidance  of  the  executive  committee,  will  (i)  monitor  the \nInvestment Program and have overall responsibility for its implementation; (ii) assist the IPIUs in \nidentifying and preparing subprojects and appraise them in consultation with towns; (iii) compile \nMFF  tranches  and  PFRs;  (iv)  appoint  consultants;  (v)  ensure  land  acquisition  and  other \nsafeguards;  (vi)  approve  surveys,  investigations,  engineering  designs,  and  bid  documents \nprepared  by  IPIUs;  (vii)  review  procurement  of  works  and  goods  undertaken  by  IPIUs;  (viii) \nassist  ULBs  in  implementing  solid-waste  management,  slum  improvement,  and  minor  road \ncomponents;  (ix)  oversee  contract  administration;  (x)  guide  awareness  campaigns  and \nparticipation programs; (xi) organize and operate the program performance monitoring system; \n(xii)  prepare  disbursement  requests  and  forward  them  to  ADB  through  the  Government;  (xiii) \nprepare and submit timely reports to ADB; (xiv) review and facilitate the progress of the urban \nreform action plan and compliance with loan covenants; and (xv) design and organize capacity-\nbuilding programs. The IPMU will be assisted by program management consultants in managing \nthe Investment Program.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n53. \nThe IPIUs will be headed by a senior engineer in the capacity of superintending engineer \nand  will  be  provided  with  qualified  technical,  procurement,  social,  and  financial  staff.  All \nengineering design, procurement, construction supervision, and quality control of the works will \nbe carried out by IPIUs, assisted by program management consultants and detailed design and \nsupervision  construction  consultants.  The  IPIUs  will  carry  out  their  tasks  through  a  dedicated \ncell  created  in  each  of  their  district  units  and  have  regular  consultation  with  the  town \nstakeholders.  \n \n54. \nTown-level  committees,  chaired  by  the  mayor  or  chairperson,  will  be  formed  in  each \ntown  with  representation  of  ward  members,  the  district  magistrate,  collector,  municipal \ncommissioner,  special  area  development  authority,  local  representatives  of  UPJN,  UJS,  and \nPWD,  and  civil  society  and  business  representatives.  The  town  committees  will  (i)  review  and \nconcur on the subprojects selected and formulated in their town, (ii) provide feedback on project \nimplementation progress, (iii) ensure cooperation of concerned agencies at town level, and (iv) \nprovide a forum for effective involvement of town stakeholders in Program implementation and \ncivic  awareness  activities.  Through  the  chairperson,  town-level  committees  will  also  be \nrepresented  in  the  general  body,  where  their  concerns  about  overall  policy  and  Investment \nProgram issues will be addressed. The Investment Program organization chart is presented in \nAppendix  5.  A  detailed  description  of  Investment  Program  implementation  arrangements  is \ngiven in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria  \n\n 55.  While  the  Investment  Program  subprojects  are  generally  identified  at  this  stage,  the \nlong-term  nature  of  the  Investment  Program  implies  that  certain  adjustments  will  need  to  be \nmade  during  implementation  to  respond  to  the  changing  needs  and  priorities  over  time.  Such \nreadjustments  will  need  to  be  made  in  a  systematic  manner  and  should  not  contradict  the \noverall  objectives  and  principles,  and  will  be  carried  out  with  appropriate  due  diligence.  The \nsubproject selection criteria, including the criteria for each subsector that will be adhered to for \nPFR approvals by ADB, are set out in the attachment to the FFA.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nApproval Procedures for Subprojects and Tranches \n\n56. \nSubproject preparation has been completed for subprojects that are to be included in the \nfirst  PFR.  For  other  subprojects  to  be  included  in  the  subsequent  PFRs  and/or  loans,  the \napproval procedures will be as follows.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nimplementation  arrangements,  (b)  an \n\nThe  IPMU  will  appraise  subprojects  proposed  by  implementing  agencies  in  full \nconsultation  with  relevant  ULBs  and  town  committees  in  the  agreed  format, \nindicating compliance of each subproject with the selection criteria.  \nThe IPMU will prepare (a) subproject appraisal reports, including the scope, cost, \nfinancing,  and \ninitial  environmental \nexamination or environmental impact assessment, (c) a resettlement plan, (d) an \nindigenous  development  plan  if  applicable,  and  (e)  economic,  financial,  and \ninstitutional  analyses.  The  IPMU  will  then  have  those  subprojects  approved  by \nthe  executive  committee  and  submit  them  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and \nendorsement before submission of a PFR.  \nFollowing  the  endorsement  of  subprojects  by  ADB,  the  IPMU  through  the \nexecutive  committee  will  submit  them  in  the  form  of  a  PFR  for  endorsement  to \nthe  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  onward \ntransmittal to ADB.  \n\n \n57. \nPFRs  will  include  (i)  the  required  loan  amount;  (ii)  a  list  of  subprojects  to  be  financed \nunder the loan; (iii) cost estimates and a financing plan; (iv) implementation arrangements, (v) \nconfirmation  of  the  continuing  validity  of,  and  adherence  to,  the  provisions  of  the  FFA;  (vi) \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nconfirmation  of  compliance  with  the  provisions  under  previous  loan  agreements  and  project \nagreements as appropriate; (vii) due diligence on safeguards; and (viii) other information as may \nbe required under the Facility Administration Memorandum to be prepared and agreed between \nADB and the Government of India, to facilitate implementation of the Investment Program.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule of the Investment Program  \n\n58. \nThe proposed Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 8 years (2008\u2013\n2016)  in  four  tranches  with  preparation  of  first  tranche  subprojects  commencing  in  2007  and \nworks in 2008. The sequencing of tranches has been based on a number of principles, including \n(i) readiness of subprojects in terms of institutional capacities and safeguard compliance, e.g., \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  environmental  aspects;  (ii)  relative  investment  priorities \nunder  the  Investment  Program,  which  ranks  the  subprojects  for  efficiency  improvements  of \nexisting  utility  systems  and  capacity  development  of  service  providers  higher  than  system \nexpansions; and (iii) size, growth rates, and economic potential of towns which together indicate \nthe relative level of priority for investments.  \n \n59. \n In line with the above principles, first tranche subprojects will focus on optimization and \nrehabilitation of water supply and sewerage systems, including reduction of leakages and bulk \nand  individual  water  metering  in  the  three  rapidly  growing  larger  towns  (Dehradun,  Haridwar, \nand Nainital) and also the sewerage and sewage treatment facilities for part of Dehradun. These \ninvestments do not involve land acquisition, resettlement, or any major social and environmental \nissues.  The  first  tranche  will  also  fund  the  capacity-development  component  for  all  Program \ntowns  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  urban  governance,  finance,  and  service-delivery \nimprovement action plan (including detailed studies and plans, cost-recovery based tariffs, and \nimproved  accounting)  and  several  key  studies  comprising  a  solid-waste  management  strategy \nand  action  plan,  slum  improvement  action  plan,  and  civic  awareness  program  for  community-\nlevel solid-waste management improvement. \n \nThe  second  tranche  will  cover  most  of  the  balance  of  works  in  water  supply  and \n60. \nsewerage  in  the  priority  towns,  including  system  rehabilitation  and  the  expansion  of  the  water \nsupply  and  sewerage  systems  based  on  master  plans  available  or  prepared  under  the  first \ntranche. In addition, the tranche will cover slum upgrading in the rapidly growing largest towns \nbased on a slum upgrading strategy and action plan developed under the first tranche.  \n \n61. \nThe  third  tranche  will  support  water  supply  and  sewerage  subprojects  in  the  more \nremote  hilly  towns  where  infrastructure  and  service  expansion  based  on  master  plans  is \nrequired, in particular to serve the needs of the expanding tourism industry and the prevention \nof water pollution in rivers by creating sewerage and sewage-treatment facilities in towns which \nare located on the banks of major rivers.  \n \nThe fourth tranche will include any subprojects which require a long lead-in period due to \n62. \nthe need for land acquisition or resettlement. The fourth tranche, therefore, based on the solid-\nwaste  management  strategy  and  action  plan, \nthe  collection  and  disposal  efficiency \nimprovements,  and  the  acquisition  of  land  by  the  Uttarakhand  government,  will  include  solid-\nwaste  management  improvements  including  sanitary  landfill  site  development  in  all  Program \ntowns  (excluding  Dehradun,  Nainital,  and  part  of  Haridwar,  which  will  be  undertaken  by  the \nJNNURM). The fourth tranche will also include road and transport subprojects which will only be \nundertaken  after  the  construction  of  road-cutting  subprojects  such  as  water  supply  and \nsewerage.  \n \n63. \nThe Investment Program implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6. Individual \ncontract  durations  are  likely  to  be  for  periods  of  between  9  months  and  3  years,  and  thus  all \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ntranches  are  expected  to  cover  3\u20135  years.  It  is  proposed  that  (i)  tranche  1  covers  the  period \nJanuary 2008 to June 2012, (ii) tranche 2 covers the period January 2009 to January 2013, (iii) \ntranche 3 covers the period January 2010 to January 2014, and (iv) tranche 4 covers the period \nJanuary 2011 to January 2016. \n  \n\n5. \n\nProcurement  \n\n64.62.  Procurements  to  be  financed  by  the  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated to \ncost $10.0 million or more, and supply contracts valued at $1.0 million or higher. The upper limit \nfor civil works to be procured through national competitive bidding procedures will be less than \n$10.0  million,  and  for  equipment  the  upper  limit  will  be  $1.0  million.  Shopping  will  be  used  for \ncontracts for procurement of equipment worth $100,000 or less. Before the commencement of \nany  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive  bidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will \nreview the public procurement laws of the central and state governments to ensure consistency \nwith the Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications or clarifications will be reflected \nin  the  relevant  loan  agreement  and  procurement  plan.7  An  indicative  procurement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n65. \nThe size of procurement packages are made (i) on the basis of the particular nature of \nworks involved, (ii) to enable reasonable competition in the bidding, and (iii) to minimize contract \nadministration  and  management  efforts  by  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs.  The  procurement  packages, \nwhich are currently indicative, will be further elaborated upon and annually updated by the IPMU \nfor approval by ADB. ADB will have prior review of contract packages under the future tranches, \nsubject to assessment of EA capacity during implementation of the first tranche for conversion \nto post-review.  \n   \n66. \nAdvance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  Under  each  loan  of  the  MFF, \nadvance  contracting  of  (i)  civil  works,  (ii)  equipment  and  materials,  and  (iii)  recruitment  of \nconsultants,  may  be  requested  subject  to  these  being  eligible  in  accordance  with  agreed \nprocedures and  guidelines  as  above.  Except  as  otherwise agreed  with  ADB,  the  expenditures \nincurred  for  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and  consulting  services  eligible  for  advance \ncontracting, will be eligible for retroactive financing of up to 20% of the proposed amount for the \nloans  under  the  facility  for  eligible  expenditures,  including  consultants,  goods,  and  civil  works \nexpenses incurred prior to effectiveness of each loan, but no earlier than 12 months before the \nsigning of the respective loan agreement.          \n   \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n67. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  in  managing  and \nimplementing the Investment Program and to support the accomplishment of the urban reform \naction  plan  and  the  long-term  capacity  development  of  ULBs  and  other  service  providers. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Services  will  be  required  in  the  areas  of  project \nmanagement, engineering design, construction supervision, quality control, environmental social \nsafeguards,  investment  program  performance  monitoring,  institutional  development,  and \nfinancial management.  \n \n68. \nA team of international and national project management consultants based at the IPMU \nwill  assist  in  managing  and  monitoring  program  activities.  There  will  also  be  consultants  to \nassist  in  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  activities.  The  project  management \nconsultants  will  (i)  support  the  capacity  development  of  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  on  a  sustained \n\n                                                 \n7  This is currently being undertaken under TAC 4814-IND (see footnote 4). \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nbasis; (ii) define the IPMU\u2019s method of work, procedures for coordination, and management and \nreporting;  (iii)  assist  the  IPMU  in  appraising  subprojects  and  preparing  PFRs;  (iv)  oversee  the \nwork  of  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants;  (v)  assist  in  preparing  contracts  and \nreview  detailed  designs  and  contracting  documents  prepared  by  design  and  construction \nsupervision consultants; (vi) design, install, and ensure operation of new systems as required; \nand (vii) oversee the capacity development activities and provide training to the EA and IAs in \nsubproject  selection  and  preparation,  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  financial \nmanagement and safeguard aspects.  \n \nTwo  teams  of  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  (one  for  the  Program \n69. \ntowns  in  Garhwal  division  and  one  for  Kumaun  division)  will  help  the  IPIUs  and/or  IAs  to \ncomplete  detailed  engineering  design  and  drawings,  prepare  technical  specifications  and \ncontract documentation for all components in the Program towns, procure construction firms for \nthe relevant subprojects, supervise the construction contracts, and prepare progress reports for \nsubmission to project management consultants. \n \n70. \nThe  consultants  will  also  be  required  to  assist  the  IPMU  with  implementation  of  the \nurban  reform  action  plan  and  undertake  relevant  studies,  establish  systems,  and  prepare \nstrategy  and  action  plans  for  solid-waste  management,  slum  upgrading,  and  PSP  packages. \nThe services of both NGOs and community-based organizations are also likely to be required to \nsupport  civic  awareness  raising,  slum  upgrading,  community-level  solid-waste  management, \nand resettlement monitoring. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are attached in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n  \n71. \nIt  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  39  person-months  of  international  consultancy  inputs  and \n1,871  person-months  of  national  consultancy  inputs  will  be  required  for  project  management, \ndesign and construction supervision, and capacity development and planning activities over the \nInvestment Program period. The need for consultancy services is expected to decline gradually \nwith  the  increasing  capacities  of  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  during  implementation,  and  will  be \nreviewed  after  the  completion  of  the  first  two  tranches.  For  contract  values  of  at  least  $0.2 \nmillion  and  above,  consultants  will  be  selected  following  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod. For contract values of less than $0.2 million, consultants qualification selection method \nwill  be  followed,  while  for  contract  values  of  less  than  $100,000,  consultants  will  be  selected \nfollowing the least-cost selection method. Selection of consultants for the subsequent tranches, \nwhere  required,  may  follow  single  source  selection  to  ensure  continuity  in  the  approach  and \nprofessional  liability  of  the  same  consultants  for  further  work,  subject  to  satisfactory \nperformance  in  the  first  tranche.  ADB  will  have  prior  review  of  contract  packages  under  the \nfuture tranches, subject to assessment of EA capacity during implementation of the first tranche \nfor conversion to post-review.  \n \n \n \n72. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \nGovernment  of  India  and  the  government  of  Uttarakhand.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to inspect, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe  Investment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts  of  UDD,  the  IPMU,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders as they relate to the Investment Program. \n  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n7. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n73. \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  has  undertaken  several  reform  measures  to  combat \ncorruption.  These  are  (i)  the  inclusion  of  provisions  for  community  participation  and  public \ndisclosure  in  the  Municipal  Bill,  and  (ii)  e-governance  initiatives  in  tax  collection,  financial \nmanagement,  and  urban  planning  and  management.  In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  legal \nand  institutional  provisions  which  are  applicable  in  the  state.  These  include  the  Right  to \nInformation Act 2005 (RTI Act), the Prevention of Corruption Act (1998), and Service Rules and \nCodes  of  Conduct  of  Public  Officials.  These  give  departments  the  right  to  investigate  the \nconduct  of  their  officials,  and,  using  the  internal  vigilance  offices  or  the  equivalents  of  the \nNational Central Bureau of Investigations at state level, for investigating allegations of corruption \nand  taking  legal  action  if  required.  It  is  envisaged  that  opportunities  for  corruption  will  be \navoided by (i) including NGO representation in the general body of the IPMU, (ii) following fair \nand  transparent  ADB  procedures  in  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  (iii)  cost-efficient  design \nstandards and unit rates of civil works in line with established market rates, and (iv) transparent \nprocedures in bidding and tendering and disclosing to the public the tenders, contract budgets, \nand all other financial information. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement \n\nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n74. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Immediately  upon  first  loan  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will open and maintain a first-generation imprest account (FGIA) in the account of \nthe  Controller  of  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  in  Delhi  to  ensure  the \ntimely release of loan proceeds and expedite implementation. The FGIA will be denominated in \nUS dollars. Imprest accounts will be opened separately for each PFR. The initial amount to be \nadvanced to the imprest account in Delhi will be equivalent to 6-months estimated expenditure \nor  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  initial  advance  or  replenishment  by  ADB \ninto  the  FGIA  will  be  converted  into  equivalent  rupees  by  the  Controller  of  Aid  Accounts  and \nAudit following its policy, and transferred in rupees through the budgetary mechanism. \n \n75. \nConcurrently,  a  second-generation  imprest  account  (SGIA)  will  be  opened  in  a  current \naccount  in  a  commercial  bank  by  the  Uttarakhand  government,  subject  to  the  commitment  by \nthe Uttarakhand government and UDD, as the EA, to adhere to ADB procedures for operating \nthe  SGIA.  The  Government  will  assure  ADB  that  all  ADB  disbursements  for  imprest  advance \nand/or  replenishment  will  be  passed  on  to  UDD  for  deposit  into  the  commercial  bank  SGIA \nwithin 30 calendar days of receipt of such advance or replenishment from ADB. The initial and \nall  subsequent  amounts  to  be  deposited  into  the  SGIA  will  be  determined  by  ADB  in \nconsultation  with  UDD,  with  particular  reference  to  the  pipeline  of  awarded  contracts.  The \ndrawdown  will  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  the  equivalent  of  6  months  of  current  project \nexpenditures  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount,  and  will  be  estimated  based  on  actual \ndisbursements  expected  under  contracts  over  the  upcoming  months.  UDD  will  draw  from  the \nSGIA only the portion of expenditures eligible for ADB financing. UDD will warrant that funds in \nthe  SGIA  will  be  used  only  to  fund  eligible  expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the \nLoan Agreement and to meet the immediate short-term disbursement requirements of the loan. \nBoth  the  FGIA  and  SGIA  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nguidelines  contained  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  Investment  Program  funds \nflow chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n76. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  adopted  for  reimbursing  and \nliquidating  the  SGIA  for  eligible expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000 per  payment,  except  as \nADB may otherwise agree during project implementation. Counterpart funds will be required for \neach such expenditure. UDD will establish a separate account for consolidating the counterpart \nfunds and the ADB funds. UDD will draw the ADB portion of each expenditure from the SGIA \ninto the consolidating account to make consolidated payments for eligible project expenditures, \nas incurred. ADB will provide guidance in the establishment of the Investment Program account \nduring the first loan inception mission.  \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  IPMU  and  IPIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  the \n77. \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  all  expenditures  incurred  in  the  Investment \nProgram,  whether  funded  out  of  loan  proceeds  or  other  sources.  They  will  establish  and \nmaintain separate records for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds.  \n \n78. \nThe central and state governments will cause the detailed consolidated project accounts, \nas  maintained  by  the  IPMU,  to  be  audited  by  independent  auditors,  whose  qualifications, \nexperience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will \ninclude the audit of the FGIA and SGIA (if established), and SOE procedures, and will include a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds, operation of the SGIA, and compliance with \nSOE  procedures.  The  Uttarakhand  government  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ndelayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited \naccounts. \n \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Review   \n\nThe  IPMU  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  an  investment  program  performance \n79. \nmonitoring system (IPPMS) acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first \nloan and each succeeding loan under the MFF. Specific to each project, the IPMU will develop \ncomprehensive  IPPMS  procedures  and  select  a  set  of  performance  indicators  relating  to \nphysical  infrastructure  and  capacity  development  and  program  management  support, \nincluding  those  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  IPMU  will  also  establish \nbaseline  values  for  each  of  the  indicators  and  conduct  annual  surveys  to  update  these \nbaseline  values.  The  IPPMS  will  track  Program  implementation  activities,  target  dates, \nexpected  inputs,  impacts,  outcomes,  and  outputs  against  each  indicator  to  monitor  and \nevaluate the performance of the Investment Program and the subprojects under each loan.  \n \n80. \nThe IPMU will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports informing ADB of the overall \nprogress of the MFF (i.e., loan and tranche preparation and approval) and the implementation \nprogress of ongoing individual loans. The reports will also provide summary financial accounts \nof  the  Investment  Program,  including  (i)  a  summary  financial  account  for  each  IA,  (ii) \nexpenditures  to  date,  (iii)  a  report  on  benefit  monitoring,  and  (iv)  a  report  on  safeguard \ncompliance. Based on the quarterly progress reports, ADB will prepare annual implementation \nprogress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the  board  each  December.  Within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion of each loan the IPMU will also submit to ADB a completion report which will cover \nthe  details  of  project  implementation,  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  safeguard \ncompliance,  and  other  information  requested  by  ADB.  An  ADB  Program  inception  mission  will \nbe  fielded  soon  after  the  MFF  approval.  Regular  review  missions  will  also  be  held  at  no  less \nthan  6-monthly  intervals,  with  a  midterm  review  to  be  conducted  in  2011  to  identify  issues  or \nweaknesses in implementation, and agree on the changes needed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  analysis  has  reviewed  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  (i)  economic  rationale \n81. \nfor government intervention, (ii) goals, (iii) sector development plans, (iv) associated economic \npolicies,  (v)  economic  risks,  (vi)  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  capacity,  (vii)  fiscal  impact,  (viii) \nUttarakhand  government\u2019s  commitment,  (ix)  coordination  of  foreign  aid,  and  (x)  conditions \nattached to the loan. The economic rationale for government intervention is justified, since the \nInvestment Program supports all basic public services which are characterized by monopolistic \nconditions,  externality  management,  and  impacts  on  income  distribution.  The  goals  of  the \nprogram  are  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  goals  of  redressing  regional  imbalances, \nenhancing economic growth, and reducing poverty in Uttarakhand as reflected in the 10th Five-\n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nfunds \n\nlinking \n\ninvestment \n\nfor  capital \n\nYear Plan, the Approach Paper for  the 11th Five-Year Plan, and other  policy documents. The \nstrategy  of  the  Investment  Program,  which  combines  physical  investments  with  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  urban  institutional  and  financial  reforms,  fully  conform  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  of \ninstitutional \nperformances. \n  \n82. \nThe  scope  of  investments  under  the  Program  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  and \nreflects  the  priorities  of  all  stakeholders.  The  investments  are  also  based  on  the  city \ndevelopment  plans  prepared  for  the  three  first-tranche  cities,  city  growth  strategies  for  all \nprogram cities, and available infrastructure master plans providing a systematic and coordinated \nframework for long-term investments and multiple funding sources. All the subprojects for which \neconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  under  the  Investment  Program  demonstrate  an  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  above  12%,  or  meet  the  economic  selection  criteria  for  the \nInvestment Program. The economic analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \nB. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis \n\nimproved \n\nto \n\n83. \nThe financial management assessment revealed that both UJS and ULBs did not have \nadequate operational income to meet operational expenses. This calls for institutional reform to \nimprove  their  financial  base,  including  (i)  increasing  the  property  tax  base,  reassessment, \nmapping,  and  computerized  database;  (ii)  a  gradual  increase  in  user  charges;  and  (iii) \nimprovements  in  collection  efficiency.  To  achieve  these  reforms,  an  indicative  financial \nimprovement  action  plan  agreed  by  the  Uttarakhand  government  is  shown  in  the  financial \nanalysis (Appendix 9), which provides specific figures for the introduction of new user charges, \ntariff increases, target service coverages, and tariff collection efficiency. \n \nUPJN and UJS have already adopted accrual-based double-entry accounting, prepared \n84. \nthe manual, and commenced using the new system in some areas, in addition to computerizing \ntheir  operations,  including  tariff  collection.  However,  other  state  agencies  and  ULBs  are \ncurrently  using  cash-basis  accounting.  This  does  not  provide  an  accurate  status  of  agencies \nwith regard to their assets, including receivables and liabilities. Further, asset receding, physical \nverification  of  assets,  and  reconciliation  with  records  are  not  kept  current  due  to  inadequate \nskills  of  staff  and  excess  workloads.  In  order  to  strengthen  the  capacity  for  financial \nmanagement  and  work  efficiency,  accountants  from  relevant  state  departments,  ULBs,  UPJN, \nand  UJS,  in  addition  to the  IPMU  and  IPIUs,  will  be  trained  in  budgeting,  financial information \nmanagement and reporting, accrual-based double-entry accounting, and the use of information \ntechnology.  \n \nFinancial  sustainability  and  viability  of  the  subprojects  under  the  first  tranche  of  the \n85. \nInvestment Program was assessed in accordance with the Financial Management and Analysis \nof  Projects.8  For  revenue  generating  sectors\u2014water  supply,  sewerage,  and  solid-waste \nmanagement\u2014incremental  revenue  and  cost  due  to  the  subprojects  are  estimated  on  a  with-\nproject  and  without-project  basis.  Tariff  revisions  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  solid-waste \nmanagement are required to meet the financial improvement action plan of achieving full O&M \ncost recovery within the Investment Program implementation period. The financial internal rate \nof  return  (FIRR)  for  water  supply  subprojects  ranges  from  1.3%  to  20.1%,  for  a  sewerage \nsubproject  it  is  7.3%,  and  for  solid-waste  management  subprojects  it  is  17.3%.  All  the \nsubprojects  have  an  estimated  FIRR  which  is  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC) of 3.58%. Sensitivity analysis shows generally robust FIRRs, showing that the FIRRs \nare the most sensitive to the level of demand. In other words, an increase in coverage is critical \nto obtaining desirable returns on investment. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development  \nIncome poverty9 in Uttarakhand is estimated at over 33%. The urban population living in \n86. \nslums10  accounts  for  17%  of  the  total  state  urban  population.  About  43%  of  the  slums  are \nlocated  on  urban  fringes  and  53%  are  along  drains.11  Urban  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  basic \nurban infrastructure and services is more limited. Only 71.4% of the slums are serviced by piped \npotable water, and only 42.8% of slum dwellers have access to proper sanitation facilities. This \nsituation  creates  unfavorable  environmental  conditions  for  poor  people  and  threatens  public \nhealth. The Investment Program will have positive impacts on poor people. Safe drinking water \nis a basic need which a significant number of the poor in Uttarakhand do not have access to. \nThe burden of water collection on vulnerable segments of the population (especially women) will \nbe  reduced,  and  tariffs  will  be  set  to  ensure  that  poor  people  can  afford  drinking  water. \nImprovements  in  water  supply,  sewage,  sanitation,  and  solid-waste  management  will  lead  to \npublic health improvements, resulting in reductions in the burden of diseases, treatment costs, \nand productivity losses, the impacts of which are experienced by the poor in high degree. Slum \nupgrading subprojects are directly targeted at improving basic infrastructure in poor areas. The \nservices  to  be  provided  under  this  component  are  described  in  para.  30.  The  expected \nincidental  benefits  are  economic  growth  and  direct  temporary  employment  of  the  poor  in \nconstruction  work  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 10.  \n \nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n87. \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Investment  Program  will  minimize  resettlement  impacts  by \nprioritizing  rehabilitation  and  optimization  work  within  existing  facilities.  New  construction  is \nproposed  on  vacant  government  land  where  feasible.  Tranche  1  subprojects  will  not  require \nland acquisition, and show that the main resettlement impacts will be due to rehabilitation and \nlaying of pipe networks, and these impacts are temporary. Draft short resettlement plans were \nprepared for tranche 1 subprojects in three towns (Supplementary Appendix E).12 Resettlement \nimpacts  are  to  be  further  minimized  through  careful  subproject  siting  and  alignment  during \ndetailed  design  and  subproject  implementation.  To  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and \nADB  policies  and  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement,  a  resettlement  framework  was \nprepared on the basis of the Government\u2019s Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (LAA, amended in 1984) \nand  the  National  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy,  2007  (NRRP);  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nthe \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy \nimplementation  of  subprojects,  outlining  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  procedures  for  land \nacquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. A \nsummary of the resettlement framework is in Appendix 11 and the full resettlement framework is \nin Supplementary Appendix F. Resettlement plans will be prepared for subprojects based on the \nresettlement  framework.  Subprojects  with  significant13  impacts  require  full  resettlement  plans, \nwhile  subprojects  with  insignificant  impacts  will  require  short  resettlement  plans.  Resettlement \nplans  will  ensure  that  socioeconomic  conditions  and  the  needs  and  priorities  of  vulnerable \ngroups  are  identified,  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not \ndisadvantage vulnerable groups. \n \n\nframework  will  guide \n\n(1995).

The  likelihood  of  subprojects \naffecting  indigenous  peoples  is  small  and  likely  impacts  are  addressed  by  resettlement  plans. \nAn indigenous peoples development framework has been formulated (Supplementary Appendix \nG) to ensure that appropriate indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions will be \nformulated in compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and to enable equal \nsharing of Program benefits should a future subproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n\n \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The \n\nto \n\nis  designed \n\nInvestment  Program \n\nimprove \n89. \nenvironmental quality and living conditions in urban areas through the provision of basic urban \nservices. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for the Investment Program show \nthat  net  subproject  environmental  benefits  are  positive  and  extensive,  and  include  (i)  reduced \npollution  of  water  resources  due  to  discharge  of  untreated  sewage  and  indiscriminate  solid-\nwaste disposal from sewerage and sewage treatment, and municipal solid-waste management \ninvestments;  (ii)  increased  availability  of  adequate  potable  water  at  appropriate  pressure  from \nwater  supply  subprojects;  (iii)  better  public  health,  particularly  a  reduction  in  waterborne  and \ninfectious diseases through water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment, and municipal solid-\nwaste management investments; (iv) improved aesthetics from the improvement of urban roads, \nsewerage  and  sewage  treatment,  and  municipal  solid-waste  management  works;  (v)  reduced \nexposure  to  suspended  particulates  and  noise  pollution;  and  (vi)  increased  pedestrian  safety \nthrough  urban  roads  and  traffic  management.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  are \nmostly  localized  and  temporary,  and  are  mostly  related  to  dust,  noise,  and  access  disruptions \ndue  to  construction  activities  and  construction-related  waste  disposal.  These  impacts  can \nlargely be avoided through proper subproject design (particularly in siting), or mitigated through \nproper mitigation measures and environmental management (Appendix 12 and Supplementary \nAppendix H).  \n \n90. \nEnvironmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  further  ensure  that  the  Investment \nProgram  will  not  have  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.  Impacts  that  are  potentially \nsignificant  and  permanent  in  nature  have  been  identified,  and  environmental  subproject \nselection  guidelines  will  not  allow  subprojects  with  such  impacts.  To  ensure  compliance  with \nGovernment  and  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  requirements,  an  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects  has  been  developed \n(Supplementary Appendix I).  \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\nThe main risks are related to Program implementation performance and sustainability of \n91. \ninvestments.  These  include  (i)  slow  Program  implementation,  which  is  a  common  feature  of \nurban sector projects; (ii) lack of availability of land for locating assets such as pumping stations, \nreservoirs,  and  landfill  sites  for  solid-waste  management,  and  delays  in  obtaining  land  from \ngovernment; and (iii) delayed implementation of urban reform action plan, reluctance in levying \nand collecting increased user charges, and inadequate public willingness to pay for the services \nwhich overall present a risk to sustainability.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  addresses  these  risks  through  a  number  of  measures.  Risks \n92. \nfor  slow  Program  implementation  will  be  mitigated  by  establishing  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  as \nefficient units with qualified staff supported by project management consultants. UDD as the EA \nhas already appointed a qualified program director who has extensive experience in managing \nand  implementing  similar  ADB-funded  urban  projects.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved \ncomponent  bridging  TA  for  Project  Implementation  and  Capacity  Building  Support  for \nUttarakhand (see footnote 4) will provide support to give exposure to UDD and the IAs in ADB \nprocedures  and  guidance  in  recruitment  of  the  project  management  consultants,  and  help \nprepare the first tranche subprojects.  \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n93. \nThe  shortage  of  land  for  landfill  sites  will  be  addressed  by  introducing  innovative \nsystems  such  as  waste  minimization  at  source,  composting,  and  developing  common  landfill \nsites  for  clusters  of  towns.  Delays  in  transferring  appropriate  land  from  government  will  be \nminimized by (i) appropriate sequencing of tranches which involve those subprojects requiring \nland, and (ii) taking actions sufficiently in advance to acquire land. The fact that the conversion \nof  land  use  in  Uttarakhand  is  through  a  well  established  procedure  of  seeking  and  obtaining \npermission from the Government is also expected to minimize delays.  \n \n94. \nImplementation  of  the  urban  governance,  finance,  and  service-delivery  improvement \naction plan will not present a great risk due to the reform-minded Uttarakhand government and \nthe ownership of the state, ULBs, and utilities of the reform agenda under the JNNURM. Civic \nawareness  program  will  stimulate  demand  for,  and  increase  the  recognition  of,  the  value \nattached  to  improved  services  among  urban  residents.  The  Investment  Program  strategy  of \ncombining  investments  with  capacity-development  assistance  will  enable  urban  institutions  to \nimplement the action plan. These will be supported by ADB\u2019s continued policy dialogue during \nimplementation.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n95. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, following assurances from the Government and \nthe Uttarakhand government are sought. These assurances will be incorporated in to the FFA \nas well as the individual loan and project agreements as applicable subject to any amendment \nto be mutually agreed by the Government and the Uttarakhand government. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  the  Urban  Governance,  Finance, \nand Service Delivery Improvement Action Plan (Appendix 3) will be implemented \nin accordance with the time frame set in the action plan.  \nThe  Government  will  make  available  to  the  Uttarakhand  government  the \nproceeds  of  the  financing  provided  by  ADB.  The  Uttarakhand  government \ncommits  to  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for  such  proceeds  of  the  financing \nprovided by the Government.  \nThe  Government  and  the  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  sufficient \ncounterpart funds are made available from their budget for each fiscal year, in a \ntimely manner, for timely implementation of the Investment Program.  \nThe Uttarakhand government will ensure that sufficient funds will be provided to \nmeet  any  shortfall  between  the  cost  of  and  revenues  for  the  O&M  of  the \ninfrastructure assets created under the Investment Program.  \nThe  Government  and  the  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  the \nInvestment Program funds are utilized effectively and efficiently to implement the \nInvestment  Program  and  achieve  its  objectives.  The  EA  will  ensure  compliance \nwith the specific anticorruption and governance mitigation measures identified in \nparagraph 72 above.  \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  contractual  documents  under  any \nPPP  modality  are  provided  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and  approval  in  order  to  be \nused under the individual subprojects. \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way  required \nfor  the  Investment  Program  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  adequate \ncompensation including resettlement assistance is provided prior to the award of \nrelevant  civil  works  contracts,  and  involuntary  resettlement  is  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Resettlement  Framework  and  Resettlement  Plans  agreed \nupon  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  Government's  NRRP  (2007),  and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement  Policy (1995). An RP  will be prepared for each \nsubproject  involving  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  and  shall  be  submitted  to \nADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  award  of  any  related  civil  works  contracts \nand  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nFor sample subprojects, updated Resettlement Plans will be provided to ADB for \nreview and approval following detailed design and prior to award of civil contracts \nand disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communication Policy (2005). \n\n(ix) \n\nfrom \n\nthe  construction,  operation  and \n\n(viii)  The  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  negatively \nimpact  on  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous  peoples.  In  the  event  of  the \ninvolvement  of  indigenous  peoples  involvement  in  any  of  the  subprojects,  the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  subprojects  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nthe  IPDF  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \nThe Uttarakhand government will ensure that the design, construction, operation \nand  implementation  of  all  subproject  facilities  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nthe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  and  IEEs  for  sample \nsubprojects agreed upon between the Government and ADB, and complies with \nthe environmental laws and regulations of the Government and the Uttarakhand \ngovernment  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  arising \nimplementation  of \nsubproject  facilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the  environmental \nmitigation and management measures, and other recommendations specified in \nenvironmental  assessment  reports  (e.g.,  environmental  impact  assessment \n[EIAs]).  The  Government  will  ensure  environmental  requirements  will  be \nincorporated in bidding documents and civil works contracts. \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  under \nthe  Investment  Program  will  follow  all  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government \nand  the  Uttarakhand  government  and  specifically  incorporate  provisions  in  the \ncontract  of  works  to  the  effect  that  the  contractors  will  (a)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS14 \nawareness  program  for  their  labor  force,  (b)  not  employ  or  use  children  as \nlaborers,  (c)  disseminate  information  at  work  sites  on  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases, and (d) follow and implement all statutory provisions on labor including \nequal pay for equal work and on health and safety. \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  will  ensure  that  within  1  month  of  the  first  loan \neffectiveness  it  will  staff  IPMU  and  IPIU  (in  UPJN  in  Dehradun  and  in  the \nsubunits  in  three  first  tranche  cities)  with  all  the  staff  (listed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B) in place.  \nThe Uttarakhand government will ensure that within 1 month of the effectiveness \nof the first loan IPMU will be registered as a society with its charter satisfactory to \nADB. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n96. \nI  am  satisfied

Gradually Move towards Efficient and Sustainable Water and Sewerage Provision  \n\nDevelop, reach consensus, and submit to ADB for its review, a detailed reform action plan as \nper Appendix 4 on WSS utility reforms, and commence implementing it. \nSeparate service delivery and regulation functions at the state level and form a small \nregulatory unit to start with, within the DDW at arm\u2019s length. \nIn time, cause it to evolve into an independent regulatory body. \nClarify the current confusing roles of UPJN and UJS with non-overlapping mandate. \n\nSeparate urban and rural water supply by ring-fencing of urban water with regard to human \nresources, financing, and accounting.  \nIntroduce a more participatory and professional governance structure within UPJN and UJS \nwith greater ULB representation and co-opting of experts. \nComplete the work for performance-based contractual arrangements within the identified first \nset of towns by year 2 and within the second set of towns by year 3.  \nIntroduce a medium-term performance-based contractual relationship for first set of towns in \nyear  3  and  within  the  second  set  of  towns  in  year  4  with  UJS  as  service  provider,  ULBs  as \nclient  and  ultimate  owners,  and  the  state  as  provider  of  grant  and  subsidies  with  incentive \nstructure and clear improvement targets on UFW, billing, collection, gradual increase in user \ncharges, and targeted reduction of subsidies.  \nIn  the  medium  term,  as  devolution  progresses  resulting  in  stronger  ULBs,  this  tripartite \ncontractual relationship will evolve into a contract between ULBs and UJS, with ULBs having \nfull oversight of WSS by the service providers (UJS) or private sector. \nUrban and Municipal Finance: Introduction

The JNNURM guidelines, taking into account varying \nlevels  of  organizational  and  financial  preparedness  of  the  ULBs,  stipulated  that  in  JNNURM \ncities over a period of 7 years, all agencies that deliver urban services are either transferred to \nULBs,  or  platforms  are  created  for  accountable  service  providers  within  the  decentralized \nframework.  The  present  institutional  structure  of  urban  water  supply  and  sewerage  (WSS)  in \nUttarakhand  exists  at  state  level  and  is  managed  by  two  service-delivery  institutions: \nUttarakhand  Pey  Jal  Nigam  (UPJN),  created  under  the  Uttarakhand  Uttar  Pradesh  Water \nSupply  and  Sewerage  Act,  1975,  and  responsible  for  capital  works;  and  Uttarakhand  Jal \nSansthan (UJS), created under the Adaptation and Modification Order, 2002, and in charge of \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  WSS  assets.  The  utilities  operate  under  administrative \ncontrol  of  the  Department  of  Drinking  Water  (DDW)  and  work  on  a  stand-alone  basis;  ULBs \nhave no role in WSS delivery. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nfollowing deficiencies.  \n \n\nThe  review  of  the  performance  of  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  indicates  the \n\nPerformance of Existing Water Supply and Sewerage Providers \n\n(i)  WSS  is  centralized  and  is  supply\u2013driven.  There  is  thus  a  lack  of  demand \n\nresponsiveness or stakeholder inclusion in WSS service delivery. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  While  both  UPJN  and  UJS  are  supposed  to  be  autonomous  institutions,  in \npractice  both  institutions  work  as  extended  arms  of  the  Uttarakhand  state \ngovernment and experience day-to-day government interference. The absence of \nparticipative  and  professional  governance,  less  than  optimal  institutions,  and  a \nregulatory regime where the government  is both service provider and regulator, \nwithout the involvement of the end user, are key problems. \nThere  are  confusing  mandates  for  UPJN  and  UJS,  both  in  their  statutes  and  in \npractice. UPJN\u2019s primary task is planning and execution of WSS systems, but in \nsome cases it is also involved in the O&M of both urban and rural WSS. UJS is \nresponsible for O&M but also sometimes undertakes construction activity. UPJN \nalso takes up unrelated construction works on behalf of other departments. \n(iv)  There is a visible lack of coordination between UPJN and UJS, more particularly \nin  the  areas  of  planning  where  a  project  is  usually  taken  up  without  full \ninvolvement  of  UJS  and  ULBs,  and  without  effectively  analyzing  the  lifecycle \nO&M costs and without evaluating different options for technology and cost. \nBoth UPJN and UJS have an engineering orientation and the two organizations \nare lacking in the key areas of management, finance, and human resources. \n(vi)  O&M  suffers  from  high  unaccounted-for  water,  inadequate  revenues,  and  high \nestablishment  and  operational  costs,  with  about  one  third  of  operating  costs \nrecovered from user charges. \n\n(v) \n\nWater Utility Improvements \n\n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  Uttarakhand  government  has  already  endorsed  and  committed  to  the  phased \nimplementation of the sectoral and institutional reforms in WSS as mandated by the 74th CAA \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nand JNNURM guidelines. If the gains from substantial investment under the Program are to be \nsustained, there is a need to fully implement reforms in WSS. \n \n4. \nDuring  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  pre-Fact-Finding  Mission  in  May  2007, \nthree options for utility improvements were discussed with Uttarakhand government officials and \nother  stakeholders.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  the  major  thrust  of  institutional  reforms \nwithin WSS were further extensively discussed with DDW, UPJN, UJS, the Urban Development \nDepartment (UDD) (including the UDD secretary), the project director, ULBs, other Uttarakhand \ngovernment  officials,  and  stakeholders.  The  following  guiding  principles  of  the  reforms  have \nemerged. \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nWSS  improvements  should  be  context-specific  and  sequenced.  They  should \ninvolve realistic measures with a patient approach to implementation. \nService-delivery function should be separated from policy making and regulation. \nUtilities should have clear mandates and act in accordance with their mandate.  \nA  slew  of  measures  should  be  implemented  on  utility  governance,  finance,  and \ninstitutional, operational, and human resource capabilities. \nDeliberate  inclusion  of  ULBs  in  WSS  delivery  through  greater  representation  in \nthe board of utilities is to be ensured. \nAn accountability mechanism should be introduced into UPJN and UJS through \nprior  consultation  and  performance-based  contractual  relationships  with  the \nUttarakhand  government  and  ULBs,  with  set \nfor  performance \nimprovements in construction and O&M of WSS. \n\nindicators \n\n \nWithin the above overall principles, the following improvements are to be implemented. \n\n5. \n \nSeparation  of  Service  Delivery  from  Policy  and  Regulation.  At  present,  policy, \n6. \nplanning,  service  delivery,  tariff  setting,  and  other  regulation  in  WSS  are  closely  controlled  by \nthe Uttarakhand government. UPJN and UJS work as an extension of the government and there \nis  no  clear  separation  between  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  service-delivery  functions.  In \naccordance  with  the  Municipal  Bill  and  the  JNNURM  reforms,  the  state  has  already  made  a \ncommitment to separating the regulatory oversight from service delivery for better management. \nWhile  there  is  a  range  of  options  for  regulation,  there  is  no  need  for  an  elaborate  regulatory \nsystem. The key to efficient, effective, and independent regulation is credible regulation, which \ncan  initially  be  a  separate  small  cell  within  DDW,  separated  from  the  policy,  planning,  and \nservice-delivery functions of the WSS sector.  \n\n \n\n7. \nGovernance Improvements in UPJN and UJS. In the present governance structure of \nUPJN and UJS, the respective boards are chaired by the DDW secretary, and their composition \nis shown in Table A4. \n \n\nTable A4: Governance Structure and Composition of UPJN and UJS \n\n4. \n\n2. \n3. \n\nNo. \n1. \n\nMember \nMember \n\nPosition \nChairman \n\nUJS \n\nSecretary, Drinking Water \n\nUPJN \nSecretary, Drinking Water, Uttarakhand \ngovernment \nManaging Director \nSecretary Finance, Uttarakhand \ngovernment \nSecretary Planning, Uttarakhand \ngovernment \nDirector general, medical health services  Director general, medical health  \nDirector, Finance \nFour elected heads of ULBs  \nChief general manager, UJS \n\nChief general manager \nSecretary Finance, Uttarakhand \ngovernment \nSecretary Planning, Uttarakhand \ngovernment \n\nDirector, Finance \nFour elected heads of ULBs \nManaging Director, UPJN \n\nMember \nMember \nMember \nMember \n\n5. \n6. \n7\u201310 \n11. \nUJS = Uttarakhand Jal Shanstan, ULB = urban local body, UPJN = Uttarakhand Pey Jal Nigam.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMember \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n8. \nParticipatory  and  Inclusive  Governance.  The  composition  of  the  UPJN  and  UJS \nboards, as well as the Uttarakhand Water and Sewerage Act (1975) (which allows for four local-\ngovernment representatives, including one from Dehradun Municipal Corporation in UPJN and \nthree representatives from UJS) provide scope for participation of people\u2019s representatives, but \nin practice they have become government-only boards. Key governance improvement needed is \nto  ensure  that  in  practice  UPJN  and  UJS  have  inclusive,  participatory  boards.  The  present \npractice of nonconsultation with ULBs at project conceptualization stage is not sustainable. The \nrole  of  ULBs  needs  to  progressively  change  from  being  one  of  passive  recipient  of  WSS \nservices to one of active collaborator on the level and type of services desired and paid for. The \ninclusion of ULBs on the board and thus in planning, execution, and O&M of WSS is essential. \nMoreover, for enhanced accountability the boards should have representation from civil society.  \n \n9. \nProfessional  and  Empowered  Management.  There  is  a  need  to  move  towards  more \nprofessional  and  empowered  management  by  (i)  bringing  experts  to  the  board  (there  is  a \nrequirement  provision  in  the  statutes  to  have  independent  professional  representation  without \nvoting powers), and (ii) changing the relationship of utilities with the state government to one of \narm\u2019s length, where the relationship shifts from day-to-day government control to the setting and \nmonitoring  of  annual  and  medium-term  targets.  Clearly  there  is  a  case  for  devolution  of  more \npowers,  with  clearly  defined  accountability,  to  the  heads  of  UPJN  and  UJS.  There  is  also  the \nneed for changing the unequal status of the two institutions (UJS is headed by a chief general \nmanager, whereas UPJN has a managing director), as this seemingly simple issue creates a lot \nof  problems  in  meaningful  coordination  between  the  two  entities  as  well  as  the  effective \nfunctioning of UJS. Empowerment of UJS management is among the steps that will address the \nissue  of  coordination,  but  more  importantly  will  give  due  primacy  to  O&M  in  the  urban  WSS \nsector, which currently puts a priority on supply-driven asset creation. \n \n10. \nEffective  Involvement  of  Urban  Local  Bodies.  Inclusive  governance  in  utilities \nrequires that the capabilities of ULBs in WSS are significantly enhanced so that they can play a \nmeaningful  role  in  all  stages  of  WSS  delivery,  including  planning,  execution,  and  O&M.  This \ngradual transformation will require the transfer and training of a minimum number of WSS staff \nfrom utilities to ULBs, either permanently or on deputation. Despite the general perception within \nUPJN and UJS regarding understaffing, both have 3,400 staff and it should be possible to have \nsome flexibility in human resources such that ULBs can play a greater role in WSS.  \n \n11. \nRemoving the Overlapping Mandate. A key improvement is the removal of distortions \nin the actual working of UPJN and UJS and thus making their roles complementary, which is in \nthe  spirit  of  the  1975  statute  governing  the  WSS  sector  in  Uttarakhand.  This  is  central  to  the \nefficient and effective working of the present vertically separated arrangement. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUPJN  will  be  responsible  for  planning  and  construction  activities  of  the  urban \nWSS sector. \nO&M in the urban water sector will be the exclusive responsibility of UJS. \nThe current practice of UPJN doing construction work for other departments will \nneed to be discontinued and UPJN should excel in its own area of urban WSS. If \nsuch  activities  are  necessary  for  augmenting  financial  resources,  UPJN  (as \npermitted by its statute) should take up the work of planning and construction of \nwater supply projects in other states. This will enhance the capacity of UPJN. \nUrban  water  supply  and  sewerage  is  to  be  planned  by  UPJN  in  close \nconsultation with ULBs (the beneficiaries) and UJS (with responsibility for O&M). \nThis  will  be  in  conformity  with  revised  JNNURM  guidelines  and  ensure \ncomplementary  roles  in  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the  Uttarakhand  Water  and \nSewerage  Act  1975  governing  the  setting  up  and  functioning  of  the  two \ninstitutions. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n12. \nRing-Fencing  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage.  At  present,  UPJN  and  UJS  have \nresponsibility  for  managing  both  urban  and  rural  WSS.  As  rural  and  urban  WSS  are  different \nfunctions, for the sake of accountability it is essential that the urban and rural sections of both \norganizations  are  separate  profit  centers.  It  is  also  vital  that  urban  and  rural  organizational, \nhuman resources, finances, and accounting functions within UPJN and UJS are separated, and \ntwo stand-alone entities are created\u2014one for handling urban WSS and another for rural WSS \nresponsibilities\u2014in each institution. \n \n13. \nTariff  Improvements  and  Reviving  Payment  Culture.  Improving  the  tariff  structures \nand rates and generating revenues so as to at least meet O&M costs are the keys to improving \nutility  performance  and  thus  ensuring  sustainable  WSS  delivery.  In  terms  of  memoranda  or \nunderstanding  signed  with  the  Government  under  the  JNNURM,  the  Uttarakhand  government \nand  the  three  JNNURM  cities  of  Dehradun,  Haridwar,  and  Nainital  have  committed  to  100% \nrecovery of O&M costs in urban WSS within 4 years (within 5 years in the case of solid-waste). \nWithin 8 years, the state should aim at 100% recovery of O&M in all the towns. In exceptional \ncases,  where  full  recovery  of  O&M  cost  is  not  possible  due  to  physical  and  hydrological \nconditions, extra costs should be segregated and paid separately by the state. The tariff reforms \nof covering at least 100% of O&M cost through user charges in a predetermined feasible time \nframe  has  to  be  accompanied  and  preceded  by  improvement  in  the  billing  and  collection \nefficiencies  and  substantial  improvement  in  unaccounted  for  water  or  ensuring  stakeholders \naccept the tariff reforms. There is commitment within the Uttarakhand government and UJS to \nimplement phased volumetric charges and metering of the WSS. It is now widely believed that \npeople are ready and willing to pay higher tariffs for improved services. \n \n14. \nEnhancing Operational, Financial, and Human Resource Capabilities of UPJN and \nUJS. Both the institutions today have essentially an engineering orientation which affects their \nperformance. It is necessary that their functional, managerial, operational, financial, and human \nresources are enhanced in a planned way. Similarly, the technical and technological skill levels \nwithin  both  UPJN  and  UJS  need  to  be  substantially  improved  for  effective  functioning. \nNecessary skill upgrading of human resources to manage WSS planning, execution, and O&M \nis  crucial,  and  organizational  and  capability  skills  have  to  be  upgraded.  To  achieve  certain \ntargets  in  line  with  the  JNNURM  reform  agenda,  the  following  measures  are  essential:  (i)  the \nintroduction  of  information  technology  and  technological  and  managerial  innovations,  (ii) \nimproving the capacity of field staff for improved assessment and control over unaccounted for \nwater  (bulk  and  consumer  metering),  and  (iii)  improving  billing  and  collection  efficiencies \nthrough  e-governance  and  introducing  and  adjusting  periodic  volumetric  water  and  sewerage \ntariffs. Lastly, a realistic assessment of the establishment cost and other expenditure of UPJN \nand UJS is called for, and appropriate adjustments are required.  \n \n15.  With  regard  to  improvements  in  financial  capabilities,  action  is  needed  in  both \norganizations  (UPJN  and  UJS)  and  the  ULBs.  Improvements  in  financial  capabilities  are \nrequired  both  in  financial  management  and  in  all  accounting  system  and  practices.  While  the \ntwo  institutions  already  have  accrual-based  accounting,  there  are  still  improvements  which \ncould  be  made  in  the  actual  use  of  the  management  accounting  tools  for  performance \nevaluation. UPJN\u2019s accounts do not have urban and rural separation and there is definite need \nfor  clearer  monitoring  of  project  accounts.  Though  UJS  does  seem  to  be  moving  towards \ncomputerized  billing  and  automation  of  other  functions,  the  impact  is  yet  to  be  seen.  The \nNational Informatics Center-supported computerization of UJS is to be completed within a fixed \ntime frame.  \n \n16. \nAccountability and Performance Enhancement through Contractual Arrangement. \nThe  present  system  of  subsidy  in  urban  WSS  requires  change  to  encourage  innovation  and \naccountability  and  reward  performance  improvement.  The  option  of  replacing  the  present \nsubsidy  regime  with  performance-based  aid  provides  a  better  alternative  for  urban  WSS. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nPerformance-based aid will have to be secured through a 3\u20135 year contractual relationship with \nUJS  (as  the  service  provider),  ULBs  (as  beneficiaries  and  ultimate  owners),  and  the  state \ngovernment  (as  the  provider  of  grants  and  subsidies).  This  tripartite  performance-based  O&M \ncontract  will  (i)  link  annual  aid  to  attainment  of  certain  predefined  benchmarks,  (ii)  improve \nsatisfaction  levels  of  the  client  ULBs,  and  (iii)  have  an  inbuilt  incentive  structure.  Further,  \nappropriateness  of  the  project  (from  the  user\u2019s  perspective)  and  low  lifecycle  costs  (from  the \nmaintainer\u2019s  perspective)  are  central  to  sustainability  of  the  sector.  A  similar  accountability \nframework is needed for planning and execution of WSS by UPJN.  \n\nD. \n\nAction Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n17. \nGovernment  guidelines  for  WSS  (developed  under  the  JNNURM)  require  states  to \nimplement  institutional  reforms.  The  Uttarakhand  government  has  committed  to  the  reforms \nunder  the  JNNURM,  and  these  are  typically  required  to  be  achieved  in  the  next  few  years; \nideally 2012 should be the cut-off date for implementation of key reforms. The above-mentioned \ninstitutional and sectoral improvements are primarily a subset of reforms which the Uttarakhand \ngovernment is already committed to. The action  plan for achieving these key improvements is \nprovided  below.  The  action  plan  time  frame  has  been  correlated  with  the  time  frame  of \ncommitments given by the Uttarakhand government under the JNNURM, and is designed to fit \nin with the tranches of the Investment Program. \n \n\n1. \n\nYear 1 \n\n \n18. \n \n\nThe actions to be taken in year 1 are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nEnactment  of  Municipal  Bill  (already  under  consideration)  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Model  Act.  This  will  incorporate  the  changes  being  contemplated \nfor  the  WSS  sector,  including  the  gradual  inclusion  of  ULBs  in  the  sector.  This \nenactment is already in process by the Uttarakhand government. \nEnsuring  separation  of  service  delivery  from  policy  and  regulation.  The  statute \nshould  be  amended  to  reflect  the  new  relationship  between  service  providers \n(UPJN and UJS) and service recipients (ULBs) on the one side, and policy and \nregulatory  aspects  of  the  work  of  the  state  government  on  the  other  side. \nEstablishment of a regulator is a provision already included in the Municipal Bill \nwhich the Uttarakhand government also committed to under the JNNURM reform \nagenda.  \nTo identify the extent of overlap in the functions of UPJN and UJS and to arrive \nat a clear separation agenda. \nIdentification of the first five towns (other than Dehradun) for entering of tripartite \nO&M contract between ULBs, UJS, and the Uttarakhand government. \nIdentification of the first town for public-private partnership (PPP) in performance-\n(TA 4814-IND) based water O&M and for a sewage treatment plant. \nInitiation of capacity-building studies for sectoral reforms and PPP. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nYear 2 \n\nFollowing actions will be taken in year 2: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStatutory changes to be made operational. \nStrengthening  and  empowering  the  governing  and  administrative  structure  of \nUPJN and UJS.

Urban  sector  financial  management  has  been  devolved  from  the \nGovernment  of  India  to  each  state  and  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  through  the  74th \nConstitutional  Amendment  Act  (CAA)  of  1992.  As  a  result  of  the  Act,  each  state  and  ULB  is \nresponsible  for  financial  management,  including  planning,  mobilization,  and  allocation  of \nrevenues.  This  process  was  further  strengthened  by  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban \nRenewal  Mission1  (JNNURM),  which  provides  financial  assistance  to  urban  development \nprojects  of  states,  if  the  states  comply  with,  amongst  other  things,  adoption  of  (i)  modern, \naccrual-based double-entry accounting, (ii) geographic information systems based property tax \nby  ULBs  with  collection  efficiency  at  85%  within  the  next  7  years,  and  (iii)  reasonable  user \ncharges by ULBs for operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery within the next 7 years. \n \n2. \nThe  state  of  Uttarakhand,  after  its  separation  from  Uttar  Pradesh  in  2000,  has  not \nformulated  its  own  urban  policy.  ULBs  are  currently  governed  by  the  Uttar  Pradesh  and \nUttaranchal  Municipal  Act  as  amended  up  to  2001.  However,  the  Uttarakhand  government  is \ndeveloping municipal law based on the model municipal act, which stipulates greater transfer of \nfunction from state agencies to ULBs, and reform in user charge and property tax to improve the \nfinancial position of urban services in the ULBs. Unfortunately, immediate transfer of functions is \nimpractical due to the inadequate technical and financial strength of the ULBs. The Uttarakhand \nUrban  Sector  Development  Investment  Program  will  support  gradual  transfer  through  capacity \ndevelopment at the ULBs. \n \nInvestment Program Objective. The objective of the Investment Program is economic \n3. \ngrowth and poverty reduction through provision of urban infrastructure and services, and better \ngovernance and management in selected major towns. The activities and subprojects under the \nInvestment Program are designed to operate within the framework of national and state financial \npolicies  for  the  urban  sector.  For  example,  the  Investment  Program  will  complement  the  state \ngovernment effort in implementing the financial reform at ULBs proposed under the 74th CAA \nand  the  JNNURM.  Also,  the  Investment  Program  will  initiate  accounting-system  reform  at  the \nstate and ULBs, and introduce O&M cost recovery through continuous revision in user charges \nand  property  tax.  An  appropriate  level  of  cost  recovery  will  ensure  the  financial  viability  of \ninvestment projects under the Investment Program as assessed in this financial analysis. \n \n4. \nInvestment  Program  Implementation  Plan.  The  Urban  Development  Department \n(UDD) of the Uttarakhand government will be the Executing Agency (EA) and will establish an \ninvestment  program  management  unit  (IPMU)  as  a  society  registered  under  the  Societies \nRegistration  Act  of  1860.  UDD  will  issue  a  government  order  to  vest  the  IPMU  with \nadministrative  and  financial  powers.  The  IPMU  will  be  staffed  with  senior  technical,  financial,2 \nand procurement staff drawn from different state agencies, such as Uttarakhand Pey Jal Nigam \n(UPJN), and the Public Works Department (PWD). The members and staff will be governed by \nthe  memorandum  of  association  and  rules  and  regulations3  as  required  by  the  Societies \n\n                                                 \n1   The  JNNURM  aims  to  integrate  the  development  of  infrastructure  services,  and  has  a  budget  of  $11 \nbillion  for  7  years.  For  JNNURM  financing,  ULBs  are  required  to  submit  a  city  development  plan, \ndetailed  project  report,  and  time  line  for  implementation  of  the  mandatory  and  optional  urban  reform \nagenda. \n\n2   IPMU  staff  will  include  a  municipal  finance,  accounts,  and  revenue  officer  (with  total  input  of  120 \n\nperson-months). \n\n3  Rules and regulation will be made in accordance with the following: Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2006.  Handbook  for  Borrowers  on  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.  Manila;  ADB. \n1998.  Anticorruption.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2006.  Harmonized  Definitions  of  Corrupt  and  Fraudulent \nPractices. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nRegistration Act. In other words, formation of a society will provide the IPMU with autonomy in \nmanagement  of  the  Investment  Program.  The  IPMU  will  have  primary  responsibility  for \ncompliance  with  the  loan  covenants,  approving  all  technical  and  financial  sanctions,  policies, \nprocurement, and disbursement during implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nInvestment program implementation units (IPIUs) will be established in association with \n5. \nUPJN,  PWD,  and  ULBs.  IPIUs  will  report  to  the  IPMU  and  will  be  governed  by  the  rules  and \nregulations of the IPMU. The IPIUs will be responsible for implementing the subprojects through \nsub-IPIUs  at  district  level.  UPJN  will  provide  an  IPIU  project  manager  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage  subprojects.  Similarly,  PWD  will  provide  an  IPIU  project  manager  for  the  road \nsubprojects.  The  IPMU  will  assist  the  IPIUs  in  the  31  ULBs  to  implement  solid-waste \nmanagement,  slum  upgrading,  and minor  roads.  The  IPMU  will  recruit design  and supervision \nconsultants to support the IPIUs in the technical, financial, and safeguards aspects of subproject \nimplementation. \n \n6. \nOnce  assets  are  created,  IPIUs  will  hand  over  the  assets  to  Uttarakhand  Jal  Sanstan \n(UJS)  for  water  and  sewer  sectors,  to  PWD  for  the  urban  roads  and  transport  sector,  and  to \nULBs for the solid-waste management sector. IPIUs will be responsible for O&M of such assets \n(Table A9.1). The IPMU will also technically assist in management and O&M when required. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Implementation and Operation and Maintenance Arrangements \n\nSector \nWater supply \nSewerage \nSolid-waste management \nUrban roads and transport \nIPIU = investment program implementation unit, PWD = public works department, UJS = Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, \nULB = urban local body, UPJN = Uttarakhand Pey Jal Nigam. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nExecution of Works \nIPIU in association with UPJN \nIPIU in association with UPJN \nIPIU in association with ULBs \nIPIU in association with PWD \n\nUJS \nUJS \nULBs \nPWD, and ULBs (for minor roads) \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nIn the long term, when ULBs adequately develop their technical and financial capacities, \n7. \nthese assets will be transferred to ULBs in accordance with the 74th CAA of 1992. The detailed \nplan  will  be  made  by  the  Uttarakhand  government  with  assistance  from  capacity-building \nconsultants under the Investment Program. \n \n8. \nInvestment  Program  Planning  and  Budgeting.  Based  on  annual  funds  requirement, \nthe loan proceeds and the Uttarakhand government\u2019s own fund will be transferred to the IPMU \nunder the UDD budgetary application direct to the IPMU\u2019s designated bank account. Once the \nfunds are transferred, the utilization of the funds will be supervised by the executive committee. \nAny  unspent  amount  is  carried  forward  by  the  society  in  its  account  and  is  not  required  to  be \nsurrendered  to  UDD  as  is  required  under  normal  government  rules  of  business\u2014a  distinct \nadvantage of being a society. \n \nThe Uttarakhand government department, agencies, and ULBs have little experiences in \n9. \nlong-  and  medium-term  planning  and  budgeting  for  the  investment  activities  envisaged  under \nthe  Investment  Program.  In  order  to  develop  the  skills  for  making  realistic  assumptions  for \nstrategic  planning  and  budgeting,  the  capacity-building  component  will  assist  the  Uttarakhand \ngovernment  and  ULBs,  especially  in  performing  various  analyses  on  a  regular  basis.  Also, \ntraining will be provided to about 200 municipal executive officers, accountants, tax collectors, \nand  office  superintendents  on  planning,  budgeting,  revenue  enhancement,  and  property \ntaxation.  \n \n10. \nDisbursement Procedures and Funds Flow. As a special category state, Uttarakhand \nenjoys  fiscal  benefits.  The  central  government  will  onlend  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Uttarakhand \ngovernment  in  the  ratio  as  applicable  to  special  category  states,  which  is  currently  90%  grant \nand 10% loan. The Controller of Aid Accounts and Audit of the central government will pass on \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n47\n\nthe rupee equivalent to UDD, as the EA, through the budgetary mechanism. UDD will open an \naccount  in  order  to  maintain  the  project  funds  in  a  separate  bank  account,  and  will  withdraw \nfunds  from  it  only  for  eligible  expenditure.  An  investment  program  funds  flow  chart  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n \nThe IPMU and IPIUs will be signatories to the contracts and the payment checks. While \n11. \nthe  IPMU  will  sign  contracts  and  make  payments  related  to  intersectoral  goods  and  services, \nthe  IPIUs  will  be  responsible  for  signing  contracts  and  making  payments  for  sector-specific \nworks,  goods,  and  services.  IPMU  and  IPIU  staff  have  no  previous  experience  in  managing \nADB-financed  projects,  and  are  not  familiar  with  the  disbursement  procedures  of  ADB.  To \nremedy  the  lack  of  experience  and  develop  the  capacity  of  UDD,  the  project  management \nconsultants and capacity-development consultants will provide UDD, the IPMU and IPIUs with \non-the-job training in financial management and project financial monitoring. The outline terms \nof references are in Supplementary Appendix C. Also, the Investment Program will provide the \nIPMU and IPIUs with organized training programs in financial management. \n \n12. \nFor  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  sectors,  once  assets  are  created  and  transferred \nfrom  the  IPIU  to  UJS,  UJS  will  operate  and  maintain  the  assets,  including  collection  of  user \ncharges.  UJS  will  contribute4  to  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  repayment  of  the  principal  and \ninterest  of  the  loan  from  the  central  government  after  the  grace  period.  For  solid-waste \nmanagement,  when  assets  are  transferred  to  the  ULBs  upon  completion,  the  ULBs  will  be \nresponsible  for  O&M,  including  user  charge  collection.  The  ULBs  will  contribute5  to  the \nUttarakhand government\u2019s repayment of the principal and interest of the loan to the Government \nafter  the  grace  period.  Assets  of  non-revenue-generating  sectors  will  be  maintained  by  PWD, \nand will be financed by the Uttarakhand government as a grant. \n \n13. \nAccounting  Policies.  The  Uttarakhand  government,  UPJN,  UJS,  and  ULBs  currently \nuse  cash-based  accounting  but  are  is  moving  to  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting  to \ncomply  with  the  Supreme  Court  of  India\u2019s  directive  of  2001.  Particularly,  UJS  and  UPJN  have \nmanuals for accrual-based double-entry accounting and have financial statements prepared by \nexternal  accounting  firms  by  converting  from  the  past  cash-based  accounts  records.  Through \nthe capacity-building component the Investment Program will assist in facilitating the change in \nthe  accounting  system,  particularly  at  ULBs,  UJS,  and  UPJN,  and  institutionalizing  the  new \naccounting practices. Also, the IPMU and IPIUs will adopt rules and procedures of the National \nAccounting Manual.6 \n \n14. \nFinancial  Regulations,  Internal  Controls,  and  Audit.  The  Societies  Registration  Act \nrequires  the  IPMU  to  (i)  submit  an  annual  report  of  its  activities  and  performance  to  the \nRegistrar, (ii) maintain accounts of its expenses and receipts and annually submit the report to \nthe Registrar, and (iii) cause to be carried out audit of its accounts by an auditor and annually \nsubmit its audited accounts to the Registrar. Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as \nmaintained by the IPMU, will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, and will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the fiscal year. The rules and regulations of \nthe IPMU will provide mandatory audit by (i) Comptroller of Audit and Account General of India, \n\n                                                 \n4   The  IPIU  in  UPJN,  in  association  with  the  IPMU,  is  the  implementer  of  works  using  the  loan  proceeds.  However \nUJS  is  the  asset  owner  and  collector  of  user  charges. Therefore,  through  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s  internal \narrangement, UJS will contribute between 5% and 7% of the government\u2019s  repayment of the principal and interest. \n5   Since the IPIU in association with ULBs is the implementer of works using the loan proceeds, ULBs cannot enter \ninto  a  subloan  agreement  with  the  Uttarakhand  government.  Therefore,  through  the  Uttarakhand  government\u2019s \ninternal arrangement, ULBs will provide a contribution instead of subloan repayment. The Uttarakhand government \nwill  determine  the  level  of  contribution  between  the  range  of  5%  and  7%  of  the  government\u2019s  repayment  of  the \nprincipal and interest. \n\n6   The National Accounting Manual was developed by the Comptroller of Audit and Account General of India in 2002. \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n48 \nand  (ii)  external  firms  of  chartered  accountants.7  As  the  IPIUs  are  subordinate  bodies  of  the \nIPMU, they will also be governed by the same rules and regulations. \n \n15. \nUPJN  and  UJS  are  governed  by  state  financial  regulations.  Government  orders  and \ncirculars  supplement  the  accounting  rules.  There  is  no  post  for  internal  audit,  but  a  senior \naccounts  officer  performs  internal  audit  on  a  regular  basis.  UPJN  and  UJS  have  reportedly \ntaken  appropriate  actions  on  internal  audit  findings.  The  Comptroller  of  Audit  and  Account \nGeneral  carries  out  annual  external  audit  and  issues  audit  paragraphs,  and  UPJN  and  UJS \nhave generally complied with them. \n \n16. \nULBs are governed by the Municipal Act. Government orders and circulars supplement \nthe accounting rules. The extant rules define conflict of interest and related-party transactions, \nand provide adequate safeguards. All ULBs\u2019 expenditures are subject to pre-audit by staff from \nthe ULB local fund audit office. The director of the local fund audit office is the statutory auditor \nand performs the audit in accordance with the standards laid down by the Comptroller of Audit \nand Account General. In addition, the accountant general (audit) office also carries out the audit \non an annual basis and issues audit paragraphs, and ULBs have generally complied with them. \n \n17. \nAccounting  Information  System.  Computerization  of  the  accounting  records  has  just \nstarted keeping pace with the progress of the shift to accrual-based double-entry accounting in \nall  places.  The  IPMU  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  adequate  to \nidentify  the  incomes  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  state\u2019s \naccounts  policy.  Management  of  accounting  information  needs  improvement,  as  inadequate \nlevels of safeguards has led to problems with confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.  \n \nActions for Financial Management Improvement. In addition to lack of experience in \n18. \nthe  IPMU  and  the  IPIUs,  there  are  four  major  areas  which  require  immediate  attention  for \nfinancial management improvement. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBasis of accounting. ULBs follow cash-based accounting while UPJN and UJS \ninitiated  the  move  to  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting.  Cash-based \naccounting  does  not  provide  the  true  status  of  the  agency  with  regard  to  its \nassets  including  receivables  and  liabilities.  Moreover,  a  strong  asset  base \nenables  security  for  the  sourcing  of  funds  from  the  open  market  and  other \nsources.  Even  though  a  manual  for  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting  was \nprepared  for  UPJN  and  UJS  by  a  consulting  firm  and  it  was  adopted  for \nimplementation,  UPJN  and  UJS  accounts  and  finance  staff  have  reportedly  not \nbeen  able  to  sustain  the  practice.  In  ULBs,  accrual-based  accounting  is  being \nintroduced  for  implementation  as  part  of  the  JNNURM  reform  agenda.  Training \nprograms  proposed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  facilitate  effective \nimplementation of accrual-based accounting. \nSafeguard  of  assets.  Asset  records  are  not  maintained.  In  addition,  physical \nverification  of  assets  and  reconciliation  with  records  is  not  being  done  on  a \nregular  basis.  Nonavailability  of  trained  staff  and  excess  workload  are  some  of \nthe causes for this. Training programs proposed under the Investment Program \nwill enable selected core staff to carry out the task of updating of asset records, \nand physical verification and reconciliation of assets.  \nStaff qualification. Due to overstaffing there is a recruitment ban in force. This \nhas  resulted  in  posting  of  personnel  with  no  qualifications  or  experience  in \nfinance  and  accounts  in  UPJN  and  UJS.  The  Investment  Program  will  provide \nstaff with training programs. \nComputer expertise. Accounts and finance staff do not have computer expertise \n\n                                                 \n7   Annual external audits by external firms are included in the cost estimate. \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n49\n\ndue to lack of access to computers and accounts software training. This causes \ninefficiency in reporting, and will be addressed under the Investment Program.   \n\nUttarakhand Government Financial Performance \n\n \n19. \nDespite  the  need  for  staff  training,  there  is  no  training  institute  which  can  impart  skills \ntraining to accounts and finance staff of all sector agencies. The need for a training institute was \nemphasized  by  accounts  staff  of  all  agencies.  In  order  to  strengthen  the  capacity  for  financial \nmanagement in UJS and ULBs, accountants from UJS, ULBs, and the IPMU and IPIUs will be \ntrained  in  budgeting,  financial  information  management  and  reporting,  accrual-based  double-\nentry accounting, and the use of information technology.  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nPrior  to  the  formation  of  Uttaranchal  as  a  new  state  on  9  November  2000,  all \ntransactions  on  revenue  and  capital  accounts  formed  part  of  the  finances  of  the state  of  Uttar \nPradesh. \n \n21. \nThe  state\u2019s  revenue  receipts  consist  of  tax  and  nontax  revenue  and  receipts  from  the \ncentral government as its share of national taxes. The main source of the state\u2019s tax revenue is \nsales  tax,  which  accounts  for  about  37.0%  of  total  tax  revenue.  The  income  from  the  state\u2019s \ntaxes  and  other  receipts  has  lagged  behind  the  growth  in  revenue  expenditure.  The  state\u2019s \nrevenue as a percentage of revenue expenditure is only 35.8%. \n \n22. \nDuring  the  period  FY2002\u20132003  to  FY2005\u20132006,  state  tax  revenue  grew  by  19.5% \nannually, which is mainly due to a 22% increase in sales tax revenue. During the same period, \nthe  nontax  revenue  grew  by  16.8%.  Compared  with  the  overall  annual  increase  in  the  state\u2019s \nrevenue  of  25.7%,  revenue  expenditure  increased  by  22.9%.  The  revenue  deficit  in  FY2005\u2013\n2006  is  a  cause  of  concern,  although  at  Rs4,234  million,  it  is  slightly  less  than  the  deficit  of \nRs4,573  million  recorded  in  FY2002\u20132003.  The  state  finances  were  heavily  burdened  with  its \ncommitment to servicing public debt and interest payment. Among the special category states, \nUttaranchal\u2019s public debt was 48.6% of the state domestic product compared with the national \nstate  average  of  34%  in  FY2005\u20132006.  Cumulative  loans  outstanding  as  of  31  March  2006 \nwere  Rs112  billion,  comprising  market  borrowings  of  Rs40  billion,  and  other  loans  from  the \nGovernment and national banks of Rs73 billion. The debt burden is rising; in FY2005\u20132006, of \ntotal loan receipts of Rs22 billion, Rs13 billion was used on debt service commitments. \n \n23. \nAs  a  special  category  state,  Uttarakhand  enjoys  many  fiscal  benefits  from  central \ngovernment revenues. One of the fiscal advantages8 is that the central government will onlend \nthe ADB loan in the ratio as applicable to special category states, which is currently 90% grant \nand 10% loan. This implies that, despite the size of the loan, the end user will have a minimum \nfinancial burden. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nIncome  and  expenditure  of  UJS  was  also  reviewed.  The  result  shows  that  (i)  income \nfrom own sources was 35% of total revenue income in FY2004\u20132005, implying that UJS relies \nheavily  on  grants  from  the  state  government  for  meeting  operational  and  maintenance \nexpenses; (ii) water tax and charges was 83% of income from own sources; and (iii) almost 50% \nof  the  total  revenue  expenditure  was  towards  salaries,  wages,  and  other  allowances  to \n\nUttarakhand Jal Shanstan Financial Performance \n\n                                                 \n8   Other  fiscal  benefit  and  advantages  are  (i)  100%  central  excise  exemption  for  10  years,  (ii)  100%  income  tax \nexemption  for  the  first  5  years  and  30%  for  the  next  5  years  for  companies  investing  in  the  state,  and  25%  for \nothers, (iii) central sales tax levy of 1% compared with the normal 4%, (iv) capital investment subsidy of 15% with a \nmaximum  of  Rs3  million,  (v)  exemption  from  entry  tax  on  plant  and  machinery  for  setting  up  industry,  and  (vi) \ninterest  incentive  at  the  rate  of  3%  with  a  maximum  of  Rs0.2  million  per  annum  per  unit  for  new  small-scale \nindustries. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nUrban Local Body Financial Performance \n\nemployees. The average percentage of collection efficiency during the period FY2001\u20132002 to \nFY2004\u20132005 was around 63%. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nIncome  and  expenditure  of  32  Uttaranchal  ULBs  was  reviewed  by  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance. The results show that (i) income from own sources was 26.3% \nof total revenue income, implying that ULBs rely heavily on grants from the state government for \nmeeting  O&M  expenses,  (ii)  property  tax  was  36%  of  income  from  own  sources,  (iii)  nontax \nincome was 54.4% of income from own sources, (iv) grants from the state finance commission \nwere 57.1% of total revenue income; and (v) almost 66% of the total revenue expenditure was \ntowards salaries, wages, and other allowances to employees. \n \nE. \n \n26.  Water Tariff Structure. The water tariff is not based on the amount of consumption due \nto  the  absence  of  water  meters.  UJS  bills  usage  of  domestic  customers  based  on  the  annual \nrental  value  and  water  pressure,  or  number  of  tap  connections.  Nondomestic  consumers  are \ncharged with a fixed tariff based on the type of business or units (meter reading) (Table A9.2). \nBy the Official Gazette Notification of 14 October 2006, water tax was abolished and automatic \ntariff increases of 15% will be implemented from January 2008. Therefore, although tariffs are \nnot based on consumption, the structure is simple and increase is predictable. \n \n\nUser Charges and Cost Recovery9 \n\nTable A9.2: Domestic Rates Based on Annual Rental Value of Houses \n(Rs per month) \n\nDelivery Category  \n\n \nAnnual Rental Value \nUp to Rs360 \nRs361\u2013Rs2,000 \nRs2,001\u2013Rs 3,500 \nRs 3,501\u2013Rs 6,000 \nRs 6,001\u2013Rs 8,000 \nRs 8,001 and above \nSource: Government of Uttarakhand. 2006.

A  sewer  seat  fee  and  tax  of  Rs15  per  seat  were  charged  by  UJS \n27. \npreviously,  but  this  was  abolished  by  the  Official  Gazette  Notification  of  14  October  2006  and \nreplaced with a sewer charge as shown in Table A9.6.

Official Gazette Notification. Uttarakhand (14 October). \n\n \n \n28. \nProperty  Tax.  Property  tax  is  levied  at  a  uniform  rate  of  12.5%  of  the  annual  ratable \nvalue,  which  is  based  on  market  rent  in  some  cases  and  on  5%  of  the  cost  of  land  and \nconstruction  cost  in  other  cases.  The  current  system  of  property  tax  assessment  lacks \nuniformity  and  leaves  enough  scope  for  discretion  of  the  tax  assessors.  For  example,  the \nlandowner  does  not  inform  ULBs  about  the  completion  of  the  house  construction,  with  the \nintention of delaying the assessment of the house. Only at the time of assessment of the house \ndoes the ULBs come to know of the house construction. \n \n29. \nActions for Financial Management Improvements. Both UJS and ULBs do not have \nadequate operational income to finance operational expenses. This calls for institutional reform \nto improve the financial base in the short term, including (i) an increase in the property tax base \nby  reassessment  or  mapping  and  computerized  database,  (ii)  a  gradual  increase  in  user \ncharges,10  and  (iii)  improvement  in  collection  efficiency.  The  Draft  Municipal  Act  contains \nproposals  for  property  tax  reform,  and  the  introduction  of  new  taxes  and  levies  for  achieving \nadequate  cost  recovery.  The  memorandum  of  agreement  for  the  JNNURM  financing  requires \nULBs,  amongst  others  things,  to  adopt  (i)  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting,  (ii) \ngeographic information systems based property tax with collection efficiency at 85% within the \nnext 7 years, and (iii) reasonable user charges for O&M cost recovery within the next 7 years. \nDetails of the reforms are given in Table A9.7. \n \n\nTable A9.7: Reform Target Agreed in the Memorandum of Agreements for JNNURM \n\nYear 1 \n\nYear 2 \n\nYear 3 \n\nYear 4 \n\nYear 5 \n\nYear 6 \n\nYear 7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nFull O&M cost recovery \n\nWater supply \nSewerage \n\nSolid waste managementa \nPublic transport \nProperty tax reform \n\nNew determination method \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \nDDN \nHRD \nNNL \n\nDDN \nDDN \n\n \n \n \nDDN \nHRD \nNNL \n\n \n \n\nDDN \nDDN \n \nDDN \nHRD \nNNL \n\nHRD \n \n\n \n \n \nDDN \nHRD \nNNL \n\nNNL \nHRD \nNNL \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  UJS.  2006.

Those below the poverty line will be exempted. \nc  Sewerage tariff needs to be 80% surcharge on water bills or equivalent. \nd  Conservancy  charge  is  a  monthly  fee,  proposed  at  Rs40  for  domestic,  Rs300  for  commercial,  and  Rs500  for \n\nindustrial users. \n\ne  Annual rental value method will continue until new valuation method is implemented. When implemented, the target \n\nwill be the value equivalent to the increase annual rental value by 60%. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nBased  on  the  indicative  FIAP,  cash-flow  projections11  were  prepared  (Supplementary \n31. \nAppendix J). The projections indicate that water supply in Nainital will never achieve full O&M \ncost  recovery.  This  is  because  of  higher  cost  of  operation  associated  with  its  hilly  geography \nwhich  causes  higher  energy  consumption  for  pumping.  More  than  50%  of  O&M  cost  is \nrecovered  by  the  revenue  generated  in  Nainital  by  the  end  of  subproject  implementation.  The \ndeficit  will  be  adequately  covered  by  the  surplus  generated  in  water  supply  in  Dehradun  and \nHaridwar,  and,  therefore,  UJS  as  a  whole  will  recover  full  O&M  cost  by  the  end  of  subproject \n                                                 \n11  For  water  supply,  a  divisional  accounts  record  of  UJS  was  used  as  basis  of  projection  for  Dehradun,  and  an \n\nappropriate portion of a divisional accounts record of UJS was used for Haridwar and Nainital. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n53\n\nimplementation. In other words, implementation of the indicative FIAP will enable UJS and ULBs \nto recover full O&M cost of water supply, sewerage, and solid-waste management in the three \ntowns  by  the  end  of  the  Investment  Program  period,  thus  fulfilling  the  agreed  action  of  the \nJNNURM.  Affordability  of  the  new  tariff  is  assessed  as  a  part  of  the  economic  analysis \n(Supplementary Appendix D). \n \nE. \n \n32. \nFinancial  analyses  have  been  carried  out  for  the  following  revenue-generating \nsubprojects,  which  will  be  financed  by  the  first  tranche  of  ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility \n(MFF). \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis \n\nOptimization and rehabilitation of water supply system in Dehradun. \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Optimization of water supply system in Haridwar. \n(iii)  Optimization and rehabilitation of water supply system in Nainital. \n(iv)  Rehabilitation of sewerage system in Dehradun. \n\n \n33. \nThe  financial  viability  of  subprojects  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  subproject\u2019s \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) with the financial opportunity cost of capital. As proxy for \nthe  financial  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  the \nsubprojects  in  real  terms  is  used.  The  FIRR  is  the  discount  rate  that  equalizes  the  present \nvalues  of  costs  and  revenues  over  the  subproject  life,  while  the  WACC  represents  the  cost \nincurred  by  the  Uttarakhand  government  in  raising  the  capital  necessary  to  implement  the \nsubprojects. The WACC was estimated based on the central government\u2019s onlending policy12 to \nthe special category states.  \n \n\nTable A9. 9: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \n\nGovernment of \nIndia \nOnlending \n\nGovernment of \nIndiaa \nGrant \n\nGovernment of \nUttarakhand and \nULB\u2019s Equity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWACC \n\n \n\n7.00 \n5.81 \n0.00 \n5.81 \n0.80 \n4.97 \n0.35 \n\n63.00 \n8.50 \n0.00 \n8.50 \n5.00 \n3.33 \n2.10 \n\n30.00 \n10.00 \n0.00 \n10.00 \n6.00 \n3.77 \n1.13 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n3.58 \n\n \nItem \nAmount  \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost \nWeighted Component of WACC \n\nULB = urban local body, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na  Nominal cost of Government of India grant is estimated at 8.5%, based on the Government\u2019s long-term bond rate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n34. \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return.

The urbanization level in the state is 25.5% of the total population in the 2001 census, slightly lower \nthan the national average of 27.8%. The urban growth rate of 3.1% exceeds the rural growth rate, which is \nless than 2%. With the high urban growth rates projected to further increase over time, it is expected that \nthe  level  of  urbanization  will  be  37%  by  2026\u2014which  places  the  state  as  the  seventh-most  urbanized  in \nIndia. The rapid urbanization, a large transient population composed of pilgrims and tourists, and lagging \ninfrastructure spending places pressure on urban infrastructure. While 80% of the population has access to \npiped water supply (compared with the national access to improved water sources of 75% in 2005), service \nlevels  are  poor  with  water  available  for  only  2\u20134  hours  per  day  at  erratic  pressures.  Per  capita  supply  is \nonly  70  liters  per  day.  In  the  absence  of  water  testing  laboratories,  the  water  supply  quality  is  mostly \nunknown. Only 20 towns have sewage treatment facilities and in these towns coverage is only about 50% \nof the urban population. There are no efficient solid-waste management systems in any of the towns.  \n \nUttarakhand  is  classified  as  one  of  the  country\u2019s  economically  stagnant  states,  where  overall  poverty  is \nover  33%.1  The  urban  population  living  in  slums2  accounts  for  about  17%  of  the  total  state  urban \npopulation. About 43% of the slums are located on urban fringes and 53% along drains.3 The urban poor\u2019s \naccess to basic urban infrastructure is limited, with only 71.4% of the slums covered by piped potable water \nsupply,  and  only  42.8%  having  access  to  proper  sanitation  facilities.  These  create  unfavorable \nenvironmental conditions for poor people, and these threaten public health and reflect the multidimensional \nnature of urban poverty. \n \nThe Investment Program is expected to address basic deficiencies across the state and increase economic \ngrowth potential through improved urban services. Direct benefits will be sustained improvements in basic \nservices in all Investment Program areas. The Investment Program will have positive impacts on the poor. \nSafe drinking water is a basic need, which a significant number of poor people in Uttarakhand do not have \naccess to. The burden of water collection on vulnerable segments of the population, such as women, will \nbe  reduced.  Improvements  in  water  supply  quantity  and  quality,  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment,  and \nmunicipal solid-waste management will lead to public health improvements. This will result in reductions in \nthe burden of diseases, treatment cost, and productivity losses, the impacts of which are disproportionately \nexperienced  by  poor  people.  Slum  upgrading  subprojects  are  directly  targeted  at  improving  basic \ninfrastructure  in  poor areas.  This  includes  improvements  in  access  roads and community  roads  including \ndrainage improvement and street lighting, provision of bulk water supply and sewerage mains at the entry \nof  slum  areas,  and  support  for  enabling  a  sustainable  environment  for  improving  basic  infrastructures  in \nslums through policy development. The benefits are expected to be economic growth and direct temporary \nemployment in construction work under the Investment Program.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA socioeconomic survey was conducted in four Investment Program towns (Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital, \nand  Rudrapur).  The  poverty  analysis  has  been  drawn  from  primary  and  secondary  data.  Primary  data \ncollection  has  relied  on  both  a  quantitative  (4,000  respondent)  survey  and  consultations  with  individual \nstakeholders and communities. \n \n\nPoverty Classification: General intervention \n\n                                                 \n1 International Centre for Peace Initiatives, Strategic Foresight Group. 2002. Rethinking India\u2019s Future: Prosperity of  \n\nthe Periphery. Mumbai: India. \n\n2  This is based on data from the Census of India 2001, from six towns.  \n3   Government of Uttaranchal. 2002. Report on Slums of Uttaranchal. Uttaranchal, India.  \n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nThe rapid urbanization, a large transient population, and lagging infrastructure spending places pressure on \nurban infrastructure, and this affects the poor more acutely. The socioeconomic survey shows that 49% of \nthe  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  (BPL) have  no access  to  piped water  in  their  dwelling,  and  a \nfurther 20% have absolutely no access to piped water. It further shows that 23% of BPL households collect \nwater from more than 100 meters (m) away, and 32% spend more than half an hour collecting water. The \nsurvey also shows that 32% of BPL households use unsanitary pit toilets or open areas for their sanitation \nrequirements. Further, 53% dump their solid waste in  open spaces and 4% burn their waste. One fifth of \nBPL households do not have drainage facilities in their areas, and flooding due to improperly maintained \ndrains is reported by over one quarter of BPL households. Twenty-two percent of BPL households are not \nserved by paved roads and 18% do not benefit from street lighting. The survey identified the poor quality of \nurban infrastructure and a gap in basic urban services, particularly for poor people living in slum areas.   \n \nA poverty and social analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, is required to \ngauge post-Program benefits in terms of improved access to basic services by poor people. The baseline \nsurvey  will  serve  as  the  benchmark  against  which  post-Program  impacts  on  the  poor  will  be  measured. \nBenefits to poor households, benefits to women, increased participation, and capacity development of poor \npeople including women are some of the issues that must be monitored during and after implementation. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nExtensive  consultations  were  an  important  element  of  Program  development  and  design.  From \nconsultations  during  program  preparation,  key  stakeholders  and  the  required  capacity  development  to \nensure  successful  program  implementation  were  identified.  These  include  (i)  the  need  to  familiarize  the \ntown-level  committees  and  local  organizations  with  the  Investment  Program,  and  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities  in  planning,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  subprojects;  (ii)  the  need  to  familiarize \nelected  representatives  such  as  councilors  with  urban  laws  and  their  roles  and  responsibilities  in  the \nmunicipal  organization;  (iii)  the  need  to  familiarize  municipal  staff  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  with  participation  in  urban  planning  and  the  process  of  program  implementation;  and  (iv) \nfamiliarizing  the  Executing  Agency  and  Implementing  Agency (IA) with safeguard requirements  to  ensure \nthat  the  program  will  not  result  in  adverse  environmental  or  social  impacts.  During  the  preparation  of \nsafeguards documents, it was noted that the relevant stakeholders for inclusion in consultations included (i) \nall  affected  persons,  including  vulnerable  households;  (ii)  program  beneficiaries;  (iii)  host  populations  in \nresettlement  sites  (if  any);  (iv)  elected  representatives,  community  leaders,  and  representatives  of \ncommunity-based  organizations;  (v)  local  NGOs;  (vi)  local  government  and  relevant  government  agency \nrepresentatives; and (vii) Program staff, investment program management unit (IPMU), investment program \nimplementing  units  (IPIUs),  and  consultants.  These  will  all  be  undertaken  as  part  of  program \nimplementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nPublic  participation  is  a  key  element  in  program  design.  Activities  to  be  undertaken  as  part  of  program \nimplementation focusing on familiarizing key stakeholders is part of ensuring their effective participation in \nprogram implementation. The Investment Program\u2019s slum improvement component will use a demand-led \napproach  for  developing  community-level  infrastructure  and  services.  Subprojects  for  this  component  will \nbe  generated  through  participatory  planning  processes  by  communities,  facilitated  by  NGOs  and \ncommunity-based  organizations.  The  Investment  Program  includes  a  solid-waste  management  public \nawareness campaign for introducing household-level solid-waste segregation. It was noted during program \npreparation  that  participation  by  households  in  terms  of  solid-waste  segregation  is  a  key  factor  in  the \nsuccess of municipal solid-waste management systems. The public awareness campaign will promote the \nparticipation  of  households  as  the  primary  stakeholder  in  solid-waste  management  subprojects.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  also  promote  the  participation  of  vulnerable  groups.  For  example,  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in program design and implementation will be promoted.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize beneficial impacts on women: \n \nPrimary and secondary information has been analyzed to assess the status of women in program towns. \nData shows differences in literacy, employment status, and work load. Because 49% of poor households \nhave  no  in-house  water connection, water collection  is required.  Because  of the  women\u2019s primary  role  in \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n57\n\nmanaging  the  household,  the  burden  of  water  collection  falls  on  them.  Twenty-three  percent  of  poor \nhouseholds surveyed report that they need to travel more than 100 m to obtain water and as much as one \nthird of poor households spend more than half an hour collecting water. This reduces the time for women to \nengage  in  productive  activities  which  would  increase  household  income,  and  improve  women\u2019s  position \nwithin the households. Lack of clean water supply also burdens women, who handle water more than men. \nWomen have higher exposure to diseases from contaminated water in the process of collecting water, and \nusing water in cooking and washing. Reduction in diseases, and reduced treatment costs and productivity \nlosses  also  reduces  the  burden  of  caring  for  sick  household  members,  which  is  often  a  role  taken  on  by \nwomen in the household. The Investment Program responds to this issue in the design of its subprojects. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \nThe  Investment  Program  promotes  the  involvement  of  women.  The  participation  framework  and  gender \naction plan identifies the role of women in Investment Program design, implementation, and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

A \nresettlement framework has been prepared to \nguide the implementation of subprojects and short \nresettlement plans have been prepared for \ntranche 1 subprojects. \nAt less than 5% of household income, the \npotential negative impact of water tariff increases \non the poor is considered to be acceptable. \nConsumption-based tariff will have a greater \ncharge on high-consuming (and probably higher \nincome) households. The same principle applies \nto the sewerage component which is surcharged \non water bills. \nThe Investment Program will not result in job \nlosses. It will encourage hiring locally, hence \nconstruction and maintenance may generate \ntemporary employment opportunities. The \nInvestment Program will ensure there is no \nemployment of children, and no differentiation in \nwages between men and women for work of equal \nvalue.   \nIn the four sample towns, initial screening for \nimpact on indigenous peoples show that there are \nno significant impacts on indigenous peoples. An \nindigenous people's development framework has \nbeen formulated to ensure Investment Program \nbenefits are equally shared, should a future \nsubproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \nNo other risks or vulnerabilities have been \nidentified. \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n\n Short  \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes  \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nItem \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  support  the  Government  of  India  and  the  Uttarakhand \ngovernment  in  their  policy  of  balanced  regional  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  through  improvements  in  urban  governance,  management,  and  infrastructure  and \nservice provision in 31 selected towns in Uttarakhand. The Investment Program will support (i) \nwater supply; (ii) sewerage and sewage treatment; (iii) municipal solid-waste management; (iv) \nurban  roads  and  traffic  management;  (v)  slum  upgrading  and  poverty  reduction;  and  (vi) \nplanning  and  design,  institutional  and  policy  development,  capacity  development,  and \nawareness raising. \n \nThe Investment Program will minimize resettlement impacts by prioritizing rehabilitation \n2. \nand  optimization  work  within  existing  premises.  New  construction  is  proposed  on  vacant \nGovernment land where feasible. Tranche 1 subprojects will not require land acquisition. These \nsubprojects show that the main resettlement impacts will be due to rehabilitation and laying of \npipe networks, and these impacts are temporary. Draft short resettlement plans were prepared \nfor  tranche  1  subprojects  in  three  towns  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).1  Resettlement  impacts \nare  to  be  further  minimized  through  careful  subproject  siting  and  alignment  during  detailed \ndesign and subproject implementation. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThis summary provides highlights of the resettlement framework (RF) in Supplementary \nAppendix  F.  The  RF  outlines  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  and  procedures  for  land \nacquisition  (if  required),  compensation,  and  other  assistance  measures  for  affected  persons \n(AP). The RF is based on national laws and policies\u2014The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended \nin 1984); the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007 (NRRP); and ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement,  1995.2  The  RF  provides  a  comparison  of  these  documents  and \naddresses gaps.  \n \nCore  involuntary  resettlement  principles  for  the  Investment  Program  are  (i)  land \n4. \nacquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be avoided or minimized, exploring all \nviable  alternative  subproject  designs;  (ii)  where  unavoidable,  time-bound  resettlement  plans \n(RP) will be prepared and AP will be assisted in improving or at least regaining their pre-progam \nstandard  of  living;  (iii)  consultation  with  AP  on  compensation,  disclosure  of  resettlement \ninformation  to  AP,  and  participation  of  AP  in  planning  and  implementing  subprojects  will  be \nensured;  (iv)  vulnerable  groups  will  be  provided  special  assistance;3  (v)  payment  of \ncompensation  to  AP  including  nontitled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers  and/or  squatters,  and \nencroachers)  for  acquired  assets  at  replacement  rates;  (vi)  payment  of  compensation  and \nresettlement assistance prior to the contractor taking physical acquisition of the land and prior to \nthe  commencement  of  any  construction  activities;  (vii)  provision  of  income  restoration  and \nrehabilitation;  and  (viii)  establishment  of  appropriate  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The \nentitlement matrix for the Project, based on the above principles, is given in Table A11. \n \n5. \nLoss  of  assets  will  be  at  replacement  cost.  A  valuation  committee  will  be  constituted, \ncomprising  land  acquisition  officers,  accounts  officers  of  the  Collectorate,  investment  program \nimplementation  unit  (IPIU)  representative,  AP,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  to \n                                                 \n1   Tranche 1 subprojects are in Dehradun, Haridwar, and Nainital. \n2   The RF reflects that Uttaranchal does not have a state-specific resettlement policy. \n3   Such  as  poor  households,  households  headed  by  women,  the  physically  handicapped,  and  scheduled  tribes \n\nconsidered vulnerable based on the agreed indigenous peoples development framework. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n59\n\nProcedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n\ndetermine replacement values. Vulnerable households will be provided additional assistance in \nthe  form  of  land-for-land  replacement  options,  preference  for  temporary  employment  in \nsubproject  construction  activities,  and  skills  training.  Short-term  income  restoration  activities \ninclude short-term allowances such as (i) transitional allowances (3 months), and (ii) relocation \nassistance. Medium-term income restoration activities such as provision of longer-term training \nwill also be provided if required. \n \nC. \n \nResettlement  plans  for  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  the  following  manner:  (i)  the \n6. \ndesign and supervision consultant resettlement specialist, with guidance from the Environment \nand Social Management Cell (ESMC) will undertake social impact assessment surveys for each \nidentified  subproject,  based  on  preliminary  technical  design;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  found  to  be \nsignificant,4 full RPs will be prepared for the subproject; (iii) if impacts are not significant, short \nRPs  will be required for subproject preparation; and (iv) RPs  will include measures to ensure \nthat socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of vulnerable groups are identified and that \nthe process of land acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage vulnerable groups. The \nresettlement  specialist  should  be  familiar  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  and \nprocedures for the preparation of subproject RPs. Resettlement plans will comply with national \npolices,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  other  social  safeguard  guidelines, \nand  the  RF.  The  RPfor  sample  subprojects  will  be  used  as  models  for  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  other  subproject  RPs.  Approval  of  subproject  RPs  by  ADB,  and \ncompensation prior to displacement will be conditions for the contract of civil works.  \n \n7. \nThe Urban Development Department (UDD), as the Executing Agency (EA), through the \ninvestment program management unit (IPMU) ESMC will ensure that the RF is closely followed \nwhen a  RP  is formulated for a subproject. UDD will further ensure that adequate resettlement \nbudgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs,  and  that  NGOs  are  involved  for  timely \nimplementation of RPs. \n \nD. \n \nUDD  is  the  EA  of  the  Investment  Program,  and  will  set  up  a  state-level  IPMU.5  The \n8. \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  will  set-up  district-level  IPIUs  to  manage  implementation  of \nsubprojects  in  their  districts.6  The  IPMU  will  be  assisted  by  program  management  consultants \nwho  will  provide  program  management  support,  assure  the  technical  quality  of  design  and \nconstruction,  and  provide  advice  on  policy  reforms.  IPIUs  will  be  assisted  by  design  and \nsupervision consultants, who will design the infrastructure, manage tendering of contractors and \nsupervise the construction process. Construction contractors will be appointed to build elements \nof the infrastructure and will be managed by the IPIUs. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n4   Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts  defined  as  involving  affected \npersons being physically displaced from housing and/or having 10% or more of their productive, income generating \nassets lost. \n\n5  The IPMU will function under a general body and an executive committee. Town-level committees will be set up in \n\neach of the program towns to ensure public participation in the Program. \n\n6    The  IAs  for  the  Investment  Program  are  the  Uttarakhand  Pey  Jal  Nigam  (UPJN)  for  water  supply  and  sewerage \nsubprojects, and the Public Works Department (PWD) for roads and traffic management subprojects. A special cell \nwithin the IPMU,  with assistance from urban local bodies (ULBs),  will be the IA for solid-waste management and \nslum improvement subprojects. \n\n \n\n\fTable A11: Entitlement Matrix \n\n \n\nLegal titleholders  \n\n\u2022  Compensation at replacement value or land-for-land \n\n\u2022  If land-for-land is \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues\n\nResponsible Agency \n\nDefinition of \nEntitled Person \n\nType of Loss  Application \n\n1.

Consultations \nemploying various methods (household sample surveys with 4,000 respondents, and two-stage \nconsultation workshops and discussion with the line agencies and other stakeholders with 462 \nparticipants)  were  conducted  during  program  preparation  (May\u2013August  2006).  Informal \nconsultations  at  the  sample  subproject  sites  involving  the  public  as  well  as  NGOs  were  also \nconducted in November 2006 and March 2007, to understand needs and preferences for basic \ninfrastructure facilities, and social and environmental issues in order to reflect these in program \ndesign.  Consultations  were  again  undertaken  in  June  2007  involving  62  stakeholders  from \nDehradun, Haridwar, and Nainital to disclose and discuss safeguards documents.  \n \n11. \nFuture  subprojects  will  also  ensure  all  stakeholders  are  involved  through  focus-group \ndiscussions,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  stakeholder  consultation  meetings.  Each will  include \nrecords  of  public  consultation  including  issues  raised  and  how  these  were  reflected  in \nsubproject  resettlement  planning.  Resettlement  planning  documents  will  be  made  available  in \nrelevant local government agencies in each town, IPIU, and the IPMU offices; RPs will be made \navailable in the local language. Finalized RPs will also be posted on ADB\u2019s website. Information \ndissemination and consultation will continue throughout Investment Program implementation. \n \n12. \nGrievances of affected persons will first be brought to the attention of the implementing \nNGO  or  ESMC.  Grievances  not  redressed  by  the  NGO  will  be  brought  to  the  town-level \ncommittees set up to monitor Project implementation in each town. The town-level committee, \nacting  as  a  grievance  redress  committee  is  chaired  by  the  mayor  or  other  chairperson,  with \nrepresentatives  to  include  ward  members,  the  district  magistrate,  collector,  commissioner, \nspecial  area  development  authority,  Uttarakhand  Pey  Jal  Nigam  (UPJN),  Uttarakhand  Jal \nShanstan (UJS), Public Works Department (PWD), business, and civil society. As a grievance \nredress committee, the town-level committee will meet every month (if grievances are brought to \nthe committee), determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve grievances within a month \nof receiving the complaint, failing which the grievance will be addressed by the general body.7 \nFurther grievances will be referred by APs to the appropriate courts of law.

Monitoring \nand  evaluation  reports  documenting  progress  on  resettlement  implementation  and  RP \ncompletion  reports  will  be  provided  by  the  IPMU  to  ADB  for  review.  The  internal  monitoring \nreport  will  be  submitted  quarterly  to  ADB.  UDD  will  engage  the  services  of  an  independent \nagency  not  associated  with  project  implementation  to  undertake  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  The  external  agency,  with  previous  experience  in  resettlement  activities  and \nfamiliarity  with  Government  and  ADB  resettlement  policy,  will  be  engaged  with  ADB \nconcurrence  within  3  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness.  The  external  monitor  will  monitor  and \nverify  RP  implementation  to  determine  whether  resettlement  goals  have  been  achieved, \nlivelihood  and  living  standards  have  been  restored,  and  provide  recommendations  for \nimprovement. The external monitoring will undertake monthly monitoring and impact evaluation \non  a  sample  basis  during  midterm  and  project  completion.  Monitoring  will  also  ensure  (i) \nrecording  of  APs  views  on  resettlement  issues;  (ii)  AP  understanding  of  entitlement  policies, \noptions, and alternatives; (iii) site conditions; (iv) compensation valuation and disbursement; (v) \ngrievance  redress  procedures;  and  (vi)  staff  competencies.  The  external  monitor  will  also \nevaluate  the  performance  of  the  IPMU  and  NGOs.  The  external  agency  will  report  its  findings \nsimultaneously  to  UDD  and  to  ADB  twice  a  year.

The  budget  will  include  (i) \ndetailed  costs  of  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and \nimprovement;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  and  (iii)  arrangements  for  approval  and  the  flow  of  funds \nand  contingency  arrangements.  All  land  acquisition  funds  will  be  provided  by  UDD.  Overall \ncosts  are  estimated  at  Rs135.8  million.  All  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation,  and \nrehabilitation  of  income  and  livelihood  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  component  of  project \ncosts.  UDD  will  keep  the  provisional  budget  in  advance  in  its  annual  plan  for  the  cost  of \nresettlement.  The  resettlement  cost  in  each  RP  will  include  a  contingency  of  15%  of  the  total \ncost in order to adjust to any deviation in the project implementation.  \n \n \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY OF INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATIONS \n \n\nIntroduction and Description of the Investment Program \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  support  the  Government  of  India  and  the  Uttarakhand \ngovernment  in  their  policy  of  balanced  regional  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  through  improvements  in  urban  governance,  management,  and  infrastructure  and \nservice provision in 31 selected towns in Uttarakhand. The Investment Program will support (i) \nwater supply; (ii) sewerage and sewage treatment; (iii) municipal solid-waste management; (iv) \nurban  roads  and  traffic  management;  (v)  slum  upgrading  and  poverty  reduction;  and  (vi) \nplanning  and  design,  institutional  and  policy  development,  capacity  development,  and \nawareness  raising.  Draft  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  tranche  1  subprojects \n(Supplementary  Appendix  H)  were  prepared.  IEEs  were  based  on  field  surveys,  secondary \ninformation,  and  discussions  with  stakeholders.  The  salient  points  from  the  IEEs  are \nsummarized below. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  improve  environmental  quality  and  living \nconditions in urban areas through the provision of basic urban services. IEEs conducted for the \nInvestment Program show that net subproject environmental benefits are positive and large, and \ninclude  (i)  reduced  pollution  of  water  resources  due  to  discharge  of  untreated  sewage  and \nindiscriminate solid-waste disposal from sewerage and sewage treatment, and municipal solid-\nwaste  management  investments;  (ii)  increased  availability  of  adequate  potable  water  at \nappropriate  pressure  from  water  supply  subprojects;  (iii)  better  public  health,  particularly \nreduction in waterborne and infectious diseases, through water supply, sewerage and sewage \ntreatment,  and  municipal  solid-waste  management  investments;  (iv)  improved  aesthetics  from \nthe  improvement  of  urban  roads,  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment,  and  municipal  solid-waste \nmanagement  works;  (v)  reduced  exposure  to  suspended  particulates  and  noise  pollution,  and \nincreased  pedestrian  safety  through  urban  roads  and  traffic  management;  and  (vi)  social \nbenefits from slum improvement and poverty reduction outputs.  \n \nThere  are  no  cumulative  or  sector-level  impacts.  Potential  negative  subproject  impacts \n3. \nduring  construction  and  operation  will  not  be  significant,  and  most  impacts  are  localized  and \ntemporary.  Environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines  further  ensure  that  the  Investment \nProgram  will  not  have  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.  Impacts  that  are  potentially \nsignificant  and  permanent  in  nature  have  been  identified,  and  environmental  subproject \nselection guidelines will not allow subprojects with such impacts. Potential negative impacts and \nmitigation measures are summarized in Table A12.1. \n\n \nTable A12.1: Summary of Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Negative Impacts \nA. Location Impacts  \nLoss of land and resettlement impacts \n\nImpacts on forested areas \n\nMitigation Activities and Method \n\n \nTranche  1  subprojects  do  not  require  land  acquisition,  and  temporary \nresettlement  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  resettlement  plans.  If \nfuture  subprojects  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts, \nresettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  resettlement \nframework agreed between the Government and ADB.   \nNo  subproject  will  be  sited  within  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  core \nzones  of  biosphere  reserves,  and  reserve  forests.  Rehabilitation  of \nexisting facilities will be restricted to the original footprint for facilities in \nprotected  forests,  municipal  forests,  and  private  forests  subject  to  the \napproval of the forest department. Through proper alignment and/or site \nselection,  the  Investment  Program  will  avoid  locating  facilities  in \nforested  areas.  If  unavoidable,  work  will  be  undertaken  only  in \ndegraded  forests.  Any  work  on  forested  areas  will  be  subject  to  an \nenvironmental management plan approved by ADB.  \n\n \n\n\fPotential Negative Impacts \nErosion due to subproject development \n\nB.

Ensure a service tool kit with necessary spare parts. \nPrepare  O&M  manuals  for  water  and  sewage  treatment  plants,  and \ncompost and landfills, to include operational safety. \n \nNo  subproject  will  be  sited  within  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  core \nzones  of  biosphere  reserves,  and  reserve  forests.  Rehabilitation  of \nexisting facilities will be restricted to the original footprint for facilities in \nprotected  forests,  municipal  forests,  and  private  forests  subject  to  the \napproval of the forest department. Through proper alignment and/or site \nselection,  the  Investment  Program  will  avoid  locating  facilities  in \nforested  areas.  If  unavoidable,  work  will  be  undertaken  only  in \ndegraded  forests.  Any  work  on  forested  areas  will  be  subject  to  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  approved  by  ADB.  Work  will  be \nconfined  to  actual  subproject  site,  and  no  auxiliary  activities  will  be \ncarried out in these areas. No work will be undertaken during rains. \nIdentify  beneficial  use  of  waste  soil.  Utilize  waste  for  construction  or \nfilling  up  low  lying  areas.  Obtain  construction  material  from  licensed \nquarries. \nUse  construction  equipment \nthat  comply  with  CPCB  emissions \nstandards. Ensure regular wetting of soil. Conduct no noise-generating \nactivities at night. Provide prior public information about the activity. \nEnsure  that  the  majority  of  the  workforce  is  drawn  from  the  local \ncommunity.  \nEnsure well maintained water and sanitation facilities.  \n\nProvide personal protection equipment and ensure skilled supervision. \nEnsure prior public information and provide notice and caution boards. \nDo not restrict access to private and common properties. Leave spaces \nfor access between mounds of soil. Provide walkways and metal sheets \nto  maintain  access  across  trenches  for  people  and  vehicles  where \nrequired.  Increase  workforce  to  finish  work  in  areas  with  impacts  on \naccess. Time works to reduce disruption during business hours. Phase \nconstruction schedule and working one segment at a time and one side \nof the road at a time. Avoid construction during peak tourist season.  \nPrepare and implement a CSMP. \n \nProvide  staff  training  in  handling  chemicals  such  as  chlorine.  Ensure \nprotective equipment such as gloves and boots are supplied.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CPCB = Central Pollution Control Board, CSMP = construction site management \nplan,  MSWM  =  municipal  solid-waste  management,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  STP  =  sewage  treatment \nplant, WTP = water treatment plant. \nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n68 \n \nC. \n \nThe Urban Development Department (UDD) is the Executing Agency of the Investment \n4. \nProgram.  UDD  will  set  up  a  state-level  investment  program  management  unit  (IPMU).1  The \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  the  Investment  Program  are  the  Uttarakhand  Pey  Jal  Nigam \n(UPJN) for water supply and sewerage subprojects, and the Public Works Department (PWD) \nfor roads and traffic management subprojects. A special cell within the IPMU, with assistance \nfrom  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  will  be  the  IA  for  solid-waste  management  and  slum \nimprovement subprojects. The IAs will set up district-level investment program implementation \nunits  (IPIUs)  to  manage  implementation  of  subprojects  in  their  districts.  The  IPMU  will  be \nassisted by program management consultants who will provide program management support, \nassure the technical quality of design and construction, and provide advice on policy reforms. \nIPIUs will be assisted by design and supervision consultants, who will design the infrastructure, \nmanage  tendering  of  contractors  and  supervise  the  construction  process.  Construction \ncontractors will be appointed to build elements of the infrastructure, and will be managed by the \nIPIUs.  \n \nAn environment and social management cell (EMSC) will be set up within the IPMU to \n5. \naddress environmental and social issues of the Investment Program, and will be staffed by an \nenvironmental specialist and a social development specialist. The EMSC will be assisted by the \nprogram  management  consultant  (staffed  with  an  international  environment  specialist  and  an \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist).  The  design  and  supervision  consultants,  through  their \nenvironment  specialists,  will  conduct  environmental  assessments  including  the  preparation  of \nIEEs  or  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  and  other  assessments  required  for \nclearances. The design and supervision consultants will also be responsible for incorporation of \nmitigation  measures  into  design  and  construction,  and  baseline  and  construction-stage \nenvironmental quality monitoring.  \n \n6. \nThe program management consultant will review and approve the IEEs or EIAs, oversee \ndisclosure and consultations, and monitor the implementation of environmental monitoring plan \nand  environmental  management  plan  where  required.  The  construction  contractors  will \nimplement  mitigation  measures  in  construction.  Implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures  during  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the \nrespective IAs, which are also the O&M agencies. Government regulatory agencies such as the \nUttarakhand  Environmental  Protection  and  Pollution  Control  Board  will  also  monitor  the \nenvironmental performance according to government regulations.  \n \nD. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n7. \nConsultations  employing  various  methods  (household  sample  surveys  with  4,000 \nrespondents, and two-stage consultation workshops and discussion with the line agencies and \nother  stakeholders  with  462  participants)  were  conducted  during  program  preparation.  These \nwere  conducted  between  May\u2013August  2006.  Informal  consultations  at  the  sample  subproject \nsites in involving the public as well as NGOs were also conducted in November 2006 and March \n2007,  to  understand  needs  and  preferences  for  basic  infrastructure  facilities,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  issues,  in  order  to  reflect  these  in  program  design.  Consultations  were  again \nundertaken  in  June  2007  involving  62  stakeholders  from  Dehradun,  Haridwar,  and  Nainital  to \ndisclose  and  discuss  safeguards  documents.  All  the  stakeholders  expressed  their  support  for \nthe  Investment  Program  and  acknowledged  that  it  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  program \ntowns. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The IPMU will function under a general body and an executive committee. Town-level committees will be set up in \n\neach of the program towns to ensure public participation in the Program. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n69\n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\nEnvironmental Selection Guidelines and Environmental Review Procedures \n\nE. \n \nIEEs  show  that  sample  subprojects  will  result  in  large  net  environmental  benefits. \n8. \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  largely  temporary  and  localized  and  can  be \naddressed  through  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  on \nenvironmental impacts is required for sample subprojects.  \n \nF. \n \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  environmental  guidelines  and \n9. \nrequirements, environmental subproject selection guidelines and an environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  (EARF)  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects  have  been \ndeveloped. A summary of the environmental subproject selection guidelines is provided in Table \nA12.2. \n \n10. \nThe  full  EARF,  based  on  provisions  of  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nlegislative  provisions  and  the  environmental  assessment  guidelines  of  ADB,  is  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  I.
