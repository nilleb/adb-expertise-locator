An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nAssessment  the summary was circulated to the Board on 15 July 2004. \n   \nProject  The Project is located in the northwestern part of Yunnan province, \nDescription  which is relatively poor. The Project is designed to promote sustainable \neconomic growth by constructing 167 kilometers (km) of railway line \nfrom Dali to Lijiang.  The Project will develop an efficient, safe, and \nenvironmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region. The \nProject will facilitate the creation of additional employment and income-\ngenerating opportunities, thus benefiting the poor, and ethnic minorities, \nliving in the Project area.  \n   \nRationale  The Project meets the railway sector operational strategy of ADB for the \nPRC to reduce railway network constraints and to promote sustainable \neconomic growth in poor areas not served by railways. The Project is \nalso in line with the Government\u2019s western development strategy to \nprovide  less-developed  regions  with  better  infrastructure  to  facilitate \neconomic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the  opportunity  for  people  to \nimprove their living standards.  \n \nThe poor interior regions in the PRC have not benefited as much from \neconomic growth and reforms as the east coast. The gap in economic \nand social development has increased. Transport constraints and high \nlogistics costs are two of the factors contributing to regional economic \ndisparities and are two of the constraints that prevent the western region \nfrom capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project will reduce transport constraints in northwestern Yunnan \nprovince and provide connectivity to Kunming, Shanghai, and Beijing \nthrough  three  of  the  16  east-west  and  north-south national railway \ncorridors. This will provide accessibility to the ports of Fangcheng and \nBeihai in the PRC and Haiphong in Viet Nam. The Project will promote \nregional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), of which \nthe PRC is an active participant through Yunnan province, which shares \nborders with other GMS countries. \n   \n  The Project, a joint-venture railway between the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR) and Yunnan provincial government (YPG), will have substantial \nmanagerial  and  financial  autonomy.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \nchanging  the  railway  enterprises  from  a  cost  center  in  a  planned \neconomy  to  a  profit  center  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \n ", "iv   \neconomy  to  a  profit  center  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \nmarket. The components are formulated in line with MOR\u2019s 2004 railway \ndevelopment plan. \n   \nObjectives and  The main objective of the Project is to remove a transport constraint to \nScope  sustainable economic growth. Providing economic railway transportation \nin the unserved, less-developed, and poor areas will help create the \nconditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating \nemployment and income-enhancing opportunities that will raise living \nstandards in the project area.  \n \nThe  project  preparation  involved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \nethnic  minority  groups  (Bai,  Naxi,  Tibetans,  Mosuo,  and  Lisu), \nnongovernment organizations, affected people, potential beneficiaries, \nmonks, village leaders, local ethnic bureaus, and local governments in \nthe project area and the seven neighboring counties (called boundaries \nof  analysis  or  BOA).  Household  surveys  were  carried  out,  and \nparticipatory workshops were organized in the project area and the BOA \nto understand public opinion about the proposed Project, and to provide \ninputs for the social and environmental assessments. \n \nThe  Project  will  entail  constructing  167 km  of single-track,  standard \ngauge, Class I railway, reserved for electrification, between Dali and \nLijiang, and expanding the capacity of the existing Guangtong\u2013Dali line \n(Guangda line) to accommodate additional traffic. The Project comprises \nthe following components: (i) laying railway track consisting of rails and \naccessories, concrete sleepers, and stone ballast; (ii) constructing 11 \nnew railway stations complete with facilities; (iii) a safety component that \nincludes  providing  modern  technology  and  equipment  for  signaling, \ncommunications, a dispatch management information system, freight \nyard operation, operational safety equipment, mechanized maintenance \nof  tracks;  (iv) installing  e-governance  and  management  information \nsystems, including computerization and linking Dali and Lijiang to the \nnational  railway  network;  (v) supply  of  environmental  mitigation  and \nprotection  equipment  and  facilities;  (vi) training  on  the  use  and \nmaintenance  of  equipment  provided  under  the  Project;  and \n(vii) strengthening institutional capacity of MOR and WYRC.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $548 million equivalent, \n  comprising  $236.2 million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $311.8 million \n  equivalent in local currency. \n \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan                                                                                                     ($ million) \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total \n  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n  ADB  180.0  0.0  180.0 \nAFD  40.0  0.0  40.0 \nMOR   11.3  218.3  229.6 \nYPG  4.9  93.5  98.4 \nTotal  236.2  311.8  548.0 \nPercentage  43.1  56.9  100.0 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, MOR = \nMinistry of Railways, YPG = Yunnan provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount  A loan of $180 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nand Terms  provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a  25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2010 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  31 December 2009  \nProject   \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  West Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC)  \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  The West Yunnan Railway Company  (WYRC) will be responsible for \nArrangements  overall  project  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nconstruction, and commissioning of the project railway.  \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed components will be  procured by  WYRC in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Other items will be procured in \naccordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. Advance \naction for procurement of civil works was approved on 15 June 2004. \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 12 person-months of international consulting \nServices  services  for  (i) strengthening  marketing  and  business  development \nfunctions  of  WYRC;  and  (ii) researching  and  strengthening  the \ndevelopment, operation, and management of the joint-venture railway \nsystems in the PRC.  The consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Suitable domestic \nconsulting  services  for  project  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nconstruction  quality  control,  environmental  supervision,  procurement, \nand monitoring and evaluation of the safeguard aspects of the Project \nwill be engaged and financed by WYRC in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n ", "vi   \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) provide the shortest land route between Dali and \nand Beneficiaries  Lijiang,  key  centers  in  Yunnan  province,  enabling  railway  freight \noperators and passengers to benefit from lower transport costs and \nshorter travel distances and times; (ii) increase the corridor\u2019s capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics \ncosts;  (iii) generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project-\ninfluenced area, and create jobs and income-earning opportunities (the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will  employ  much  local \nunskilled labor); (iv) provide an area that lacked adequate cost-efficient \ntransportation services with access to broader markets; and (v) stimulate \nlocal development through tourism, railway station area development, \nand other infrastructure elements to maximize the railway\u2019s benefits.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues generated by the economic development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) freight users who will switch \nfrom the existing Class II road and benefit from more affordable, faster, \nand safer trips; (ii) passengers, including tourists, who will benefit from \naffordable,  faster,  and  safer  trips;  (iii) the  local  population  who  will \nbenefit from the lower prices of commodities and services transported by \nthe project railway; (iv) local labor involved in construction work and the \nsupply  of  materials  during  implementation  and  in loading/unloading \nduring the operation of the railway; (v) local farmers who will be able to \nsell their products at market prices without paying a high margin to a \ntransport intermediary;  (vi) local  manufacturers  and  traders  who can \nincrease production capacity or establish businesses and will transport \ntheir goods and services by the railway; and (vii) local governments who \nwill benefit from the increased opportunity for local area development \nand increased revenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 1.1 million people living in the project area, \nwhich includes Dali county, Heqing county, and Lijiang city. Seventy-five \npercent of the beneficiaries live in rural areas, and 30% are poor with an \nannual net income per capita of less than CNY900. The poverty and \nsocial assessment looked at the seven counties of the BOA, namely \nEryuan and  Jianchuan counties in Dali Bai prefecture, Ninglang and \nYongsheng  Counties  in  Lijiang  prefecture,  Weixi  and  Xianggelila \n(Zhongdian)  counties  in  Diqing  prefecture,  and  Lanping  county  in \nNujiang prefecture. About 91% of the population living in the BOA is \nrural and the poverty incidence is more than 60%. The links between \npoverty, minorities, difficult topography, and poor transport systems are \napparent  in  the  project  area  for  the  proposed  Dali-Lijiang  railway. \nPoverty is often caused by geographic remoteness and isolation, limited \ntransport  access,  high  transport  costs,  and  poor  access  to  market \ninformation as well as limited access to health, education, and other \nsocial services. \n ", "  vii \n   \n \n  The Project will facilitate the creation of additional employment and \nincome-generating opportunities. About 96,800 person-years of work will \nbe  created  during  construction.  This  will  provide  direct  employment \nopportunities to over 7,000 poor people, the majority of whom are ethnic \nminorities. Railway  station area development will increase incomes in \nlocal communities and help generate local revenues. The Project will \nfacilitate the development of local industry and tourism, which will help \ngenerate additional opportunities in the future for local people, who as \nethnic minorities, prefer to remain in their native lands.  Consultations \nwith the ethnic minorities (such as the Naxi, Bai, Tibetans, Yi, and \nMosuo) in the project area and the BOA indicated their strong support \nfor the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  6.7% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 4.5% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17%.  \n   \nRisks and  The  railway  will  be  constructed  in  mountainous  terrain,  which is a \nAssumptions  significant technical  challenge. The associated physical risks  include \n  delays,  cost  overruns,  worker  health  and  safety,  and  environmental \n  impacts. These potential risks have been assessed  and appropriate \n  mitigating measures provided. \n   \n  Resettlement will affect about 8,000 people. The railway alignment was \n  selected to minimize resettlement, where possible. The resettlement \n  plan includes preferential treatment for employment during construction, \nsupply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near railway \nstations, and job training.  \n \nSome of the economic development induced by the new railway line \nmay  have  indirect,  adverse  impacts  for  some  ethnic  minorities.  To \nreduce this potential risk, special measures have been included in the \nresettlement plan and the ethnic minorities development plan to mitigate \nthe effects of social risks such as impoverishment and social exclusion, \nand  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies.  A \ncomprehensive monitoring system has been included in the Project to \nmonitor the impacts of development activities  and to take appropriate \nmeasures to reduce their impact. \n \nIntermodal competition  among railways and roads will create market \nrisks  to  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \nfreight operators and passengers found that the railway would have \nseveral advantages over other transport  modes: lower fares, shorter \ntravel  times,  safety,  and  punctuality.  The  increasing  commercial \norientation of the joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n   \n   \n ", "viii  \nThe Technical  The TA for Support to Ethnic Minorities Development Plan, for $150,000 \nAssistance  equivalent, will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The TA will assist the local governments in (i) capacity building \nand skill enhancement programs for the poor, vulnerable groups, and \nethnic  minorities,  particularly  with  regard  to  income  generation, \nsustainability, cultural tourism and eco-tourism; (ii) undertaking feasibility \nstudies  for  cultural  protection  and  preservation;  and  (iii) assessing \nmeasures taken or planned for the preservation of local cultures, and \nrecommendation  of  further  measures,  if  any,  required  prior  to  the \ncompletion of the Project. \n ", " ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Dali-Lijiang Railway Project. The report also \ndescribes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Support to Ethnic Minorities Development \nPlan and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2003, \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  an \naccordingly rapid increase in demand for transportation. The annual  growth of passenger \ntransport was 9.2% and freight transport grew at 7.1% during the 1978\u20132003 period. In 2003, \nroad traffic accounted for 55.8% of total passenger-kilometers (km) followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 9.1%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.5%. The modal split for \nfreight ton-kilometers (ton-km) was 53.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 32% for railways, \n13.2% for roads, 1.4% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3.  Railways are one of the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. \nAt the end of 2003, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised a total of 73,000 route-km, of which \n60,446 km  are  national,  and  12,554 km  are  joint-venture  and  local  railways.  The  national \nrailways are state owned and operated as an integrated system by the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR).  The  joint-venture  and  local  railways  consist  of  regional  lines  within  provincial \nboundaries, and are constructed under the sponsorship of provincial governments and/or MOR \nto serve local needs and provide interconnection to the national railway network. Despite its \nlarge size, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population \nand land area.1  \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second-highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan. Locomotive turnover  is the highest in the world. \nBetween 1978 and 2003, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to 1,725 billion ton-km, \nequivalent to an annual growth rate of 4.8%, while passenger traffic grew at 6.1% annually, \nincreasing from 109 billion passenger-km to 479 billion passenger-km. The average distance for \nrailway journeys increased from 134 km in 1978 to 492 km in 2003, compared with the average \njourney per passenger  on roads, which grew from 35 km to 53 km over the same period. \nDespite such growth rates, the railways\u2019 capacity has lagged behind demand, resulting, for \nexample, in delays in delivering coal to power plants, which in turn, have contributed to power \nshortages.  Given  the  railways\u2019  important  role  in  providing  economic  transportation,  these \ncapacity limitations, if not removed, will continue to adversely affect efficient economic growth. \nBecause of these concerns, the Government has adopted an aggressive plan to improve the \nrailways and has planned network extensions and construction in underserved areas. The \nproposed Project will support this plan.  A project framework that outlines the goal, purpose, \noutputs, and activities/inputs is in Appendix 1 and a problem and constraint analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy  \n5.  The Government's policy for railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the capacity of the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture local \nrailways to promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety \nof the existing system by using new technology and modern management tools in planning and \noperation,  (iv) reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  the \ncommercialization  of  services,  (v) initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \n6.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess  to  unserved  areas,  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km; \n(ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000 km  of  key  lines  to  increase \ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km with the total length of such high-\nspeed lines reaching 15,000 km. A total investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion \non capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock, is planned for the railway sector. \nDuring  2003\u20132007,  the  investments  for  capital  construction  are  expected  to  reach \nCNY450 billion (Appendix 3). \n \n7.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 km to 85,000 km \nby 2010, and to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speeds is a major goal. Train speeds will \nbe raised to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to the \ndevelopment of railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained \nless developed. The route network length will reach 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC \nby 2020. To improve operational efficiency, steps will be taken to separate passenger and \nfreight trains on key rail corridors. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Sector Experience \n8.  ADB's strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping to: (i) expand the railway \nsystem  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas;  (ii) modernize  and \nincrease  the  capacity  to  improve  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the national railway system; \n(iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient operations; and (iv) increase railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has focused on \nthe development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable \neconomic growth and reduce poverty. ADB has provided 11 loans totaling $2.06 billion to \nfinance the construction of about 1,754 km of seven provincial railways operated by joint \nventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under the four national railway projects \n(Appendix 4). The proposed Project, designed to promote economic growth by providing railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  in  northwestern  Yunnan,  is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s railway sector strategy for the PRC. \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue  \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway sector and has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 10 TAs totaling $4.6 million have \nbeen provided for institutional development of local railways, tariff and organizational studies for \nthe Jing-Jiu railway, the enhancement of commercial and business operations, marketing and \n ", "  3 \nbusiness  development,  developing  human  resources,  and  improving  systems  of  financial \nmanagement and accounting (Appendix 4).  \n \n10.  Progress has been achieved as MOR has adopted a structured approach to railway \nreform. A new management concept, the Asset Operating Liability System, was introduced as a \npilot project in 1999. Under this system, MOR entered into management contracts with railway \nadministrations  to  improve  profitability.  The  management  contracts  helped  improve  the \noperational and financial performance of the railway administrations. The system was extended \nto all 14 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key element of \nMOR\u2019s restructuring program. The number of employees in the core transportation business \nwas reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.48 million in 2002. In the noncore transportation \nbusiness, five large companies employing 616,500 staff have been divested. To provide jobs for \nredundant staff, by the end of 2002 MOR had set up 7,681 diversified businesses (independent \nof the core transportation business), employing more than 400,000 staff to supply equipment, \ngoods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for \nhealth insurance and pensions for railway employees. Since 2000, 225 educational institutes, \n10 universities, and 13 hospitals have been transferred to local governments, and 120 branch \nlines comprising 7,800 km of route have been separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating losses. The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 5. \n \n11.  The  emphasis  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  in  the  railway  sector  covers: \n(i) poverty reduction as the overarching objective of ADB\u2019s operations, (ii) full compliance with \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  (iii) sector  reforms,  (iv) marketing  and  business  development, \n(v) private sector participation and nongovernment financing, and (vi) regional cooperation. The \n2004 railway development plan defines the major goals for the railways to 2020, and is in broad \nagreement with the ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. MOR seeks to: (i) study and learn from best \ninternational  practices  worldwide;  (ii) separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation \nbusinesses; (iii) rationalize and reduce the numbers of staff; (iv) reform the railway investment \nand financing system; and (v) establish specialized transportation companies. \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n12.  The strategic purpose of the Project is to create conditions for sustainable economic \ngrowth to help improve living standards in the project area. The Project is located in an \nunserved area, which has the potential for economic growth once improved, cost-effective \ntransport access is provided. Identifying ways to enhance the Project\u2019s poverty reduction impact \nhas been an integral part of project planning and design. Specific features of project design to \nhelp enhance project benefits for the poor include: (i) providing employment during construction \nand operation of the Dali\u2013Lijiang Railway  (DLR) on a preferential basis to poor workers;2 \n(ii) encouraging the use of locally produced materials that meet the requirements of quality and \neconomy; (iii) including provisions for railway station area development; (iv) using station access \nand  construction  access  roads  to  more  widely  distribute  the  Project's  benefits;  and \n(v) encouraging the use of poverty reduction programs of local governments to complement the \npoverty reduction efforts of the Project.3 The Project will finance 251 km of construction access \nroads, which will be handed over to local governments at the end of the construction period. The \nlocal governments have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and transport services in the \nproject area  concurrently with the Project. Such roads will reach most of the provincially \n                                                 \n2  In the Guizhou-Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and \n64% during peak construction.  \n3  Some completed projects reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal were raised above the poverty line \nupon project completion. The Hefei-Jiujiang Railway Project showed 41% of the poor were raised above the \npoverty line from 1992 to 1997.  \n ", "4   \ndesignated poverty villages. The Project and the complementary local development will ensure \nwelfare gains for the poor and help spread project benefits more widely in the project area. \n \nb.  Sector Reforms \n13.  ADB  is  supporting  institutional  reform  of  the  PRC  railway  sector to separate the \nGovernment\u2019s  function  and  the  enterprise  function,  giving  full  play  to  market  forces  and \nincreasing the competitiveness of the railways. Separation of core transport business from \nnoncore transport business, segmentation of passenger and freight services, and strengthening \nof the recently corporatized specialized transportation companies will be actively pursued under \nthe Project. As part of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR, three large companies handling \ncontainers, special goods, and express parcels are in the process of separation. A notification to \nthis effect was issued on 28 December 2003. 4 This issue will be further pursued during the \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Rationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and \nnontransportation staff numbers will also be pursued. ADB will continue supporting operational \nreforms, including emphasis on safety and the introduction of safe and reliable technology, \nupgrading speeds, introduction of dedicated passenger and freight lines, modern dispatch \ncontrol systems, and high-quality information systems on the railway network. The PRC\u2019s \naccession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  December  2001  has  intensified \ncompetition  among  different  transport  modes  and  the  structure  of  transport  demand  may \nchange.5 ADB has provided an advisory TA for policy reform related to WTO accession.6 During \nproject processing, close coordination was maintained with the World Bank and a common \napproach to reforms and assistance was developed. Policy coordination with the World Bank \nwill be continued during project implementation. \n \nc.  Marketing and Business Development  \n14.  As the PRC progresses to a market economy, the railways will need to compete on the \nbasis of price and service quality to provide transportation services to an increasingly diversified \nand discriminating market. New marketing and business development initiatives are needed \nboth for freight and passenger services to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has supported \nproject-specific studies to create marketing and business development opportunities, including \nskills  and  knowledge  for  market-oriented operation, and to create awareness of profitable \noperations. These initiatives will be pursued under the Project through a West Yunnan Railway \nCompany (WYRC) capacity-development program.  \n \nd.  Private Sector Participation  \n15.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue has been designed to encourage the participation of the private \nsector in the railway sector in the provision of services, construction, tourism, container, and \nparcel related businesses. Establishing a large container terminal at Kunming will facilitate \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail-transported \ncontainers. Under the Project, container-handling facilities will be set up at Lijiang. MOR will \nencourage the development of industrial sidings, station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. \nActivities such as track maintenance, maintenance of electric power cables, loading/unloading, \n                                                 \n4  These companies are China Railway Container Transport Co. Ltd, China Railway Special Goods Co. Ltd, and \nChina Railway Express Parcel Co. Ltd. The startup process is ongoing. Separation of container businesses had \nbeen agreed to between MOR and ADB as part of the ADB-financed Yichang-Wanzhou Railway Project.  \n5  Since opening up the freight transport market to foreign companies under WTO commitments, two joint-venture \ncompanies with foreign participation have entered the market. \n6  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for World Trade Organization-Policy Reform \nSupport to the Ministry of Railways. Manila. \n ", "  5 \nand other logistics facilities will be outsourced. All of these actions will enhance opportunities for \nprivate sector participation. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n16.  Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC shows \nstrong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the executing agencies (EAs) with \nregard to project implementation. The speed of implementation has generally exceeded the \nexpectations at the time of appraisal. The EAs generally complied with the loan covenants. \nResettlement and environmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants \nwere complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial statements were found generally \nacceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 11 railway projects, five7 are complete, three8 have started trial operations, \nand three9 are being implemented. \n \n17.  The key lessons from the postevaluation and project completion reports of the previous \nrailway projects highlight the need to: (i) ensure that the EA established for project processing \nand  implementation  is  also  responsible  for  project  operations;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic \nforecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, as well as the impact on project \nviability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that may \ncompete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined debt-equity ratios.  The major lessons learned and accomplishments under these \nprojects are given in Appendix 6. \n \n18.  Previous railway projects have contributed to positive socioeconomic development in the \nproject-influenced areas. The main impacts experienced were: (i) new railway lines in less-\ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development resulting in higher growth rates of GDP \nand rural incomes relative to the without-project scenario;10 (ii) construction activities generated \ndemand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor  workers  who  would  have  otherwise \nremained unemployed or underemployed;11 (iii) service roads built for construction activities \nopened  up  and  benefited  rural  communities  in  inaccessible  areas;  (iv) domestic  resource \nmobilization improved, providing additional resources for social programs12 and generating \n                                                 \n7  The completed railway projects include Loan 948-PRC (ADB. 1989. Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project. Manila) for \n$39.7 million, approved on 31 January 1989; Loan 1087-PRC (ADB. 1991.  Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project. \nManila) for $67.5 million, approved on 20 June 1991; Loan 1167-PRC (ADB. 1992. Guang-Mei-Shan Railway \nProject. Manila) for $200 million, approved on 25 June 1992; Loan 1221-PRC (ADB. 1993. Hefei Jiujiang Railway \nProject. Manila) for $110 million, approved on 30 March 1993; and Loan 1305-PRC (ADB. 1994. Jing-Jiu Railway \nTechnical Enhancement Project. Manila) for $200 million, approved on 14 July 1994.  \n8  The railway projects under trial operation include Loan 1439-PRC (ADB. 1996. Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project. \nManila) for $100 million, approved on 4 June 1996; Loan 1553-PRC (ADB. 1997. Shenmu-Yan'an Railway Project. \nManila) for $200 million, approved on 29 September 1997; and Loan 1626-PRC (ADB. 1998. Guizhou-Shuibai \nRailway Project. Manila) for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998.  \n9  The railway projects under implementation include Loan 1748-PRC (ADB. 2000.  Hefei-Xi'an Railway Project. \nManila) for $300 million, approved on 17 August 2000; Loan 1850-PRC (ADB. 2001. Ganzhou-Longyan Railway \nProject. Manila) for $200 million, approved on 18 October 2001; and Loan 2051-PRC (ADB. 2003.  Yichang \nWanzhou Railway Project. Manila) for $500 million, approved on 15 December 2003.  \n10  In the project area of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 7) the GDP of 10 counties in Jiangxi province increased from \nCNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5% compared with 10.2% for the \nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n11  During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou-Shuibai Railway (footnote 8), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people, in the process raising them above the poverty line. \n12  The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing-Jiu Railway \n(footnote 7) increased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing-Jiu Railway. \n ", "6   \nemployment;  (v) supply  and  transportation  of  local  materials  generated  employment; \n(vi) improved and lower-cost transport resulted in lower prices of agricultural inputs (such as \nfertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, increased \nthe  mobility  of  rural  residents,  and  allowed  access  to  more  markets  and  employment \nopportunities and social services beyond immediate communities; (vii) counties provided with \nnew railway access recorded higher GDP growth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment \nenvironment was enhanced, resulting in rapid development of secondary and tertiary industries \nthat generated employment;13 (ix) the consequent shift in the structure of employment from low-\nproductivity  agriculture  to  higher-productivity  agro-processing  and  light  industry  increased \nemployment  opportunities  for  women  whose  incomes  and  social  status  then  improved;14 \n(x) tourism  developed  because  of  more  affordable  and  convenient  railway  travel;  and \n(xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the projects as agreed \nat  appraisal,  and  environmental  impacts  of  induced  developments  were  addressed  in \naccordance with the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the projects. In summary, the \nrailway projects have contributed to a transformation of local economies. Per capita rural \nincomes in project areas increased substantially from preproject levels. Living standards were \nraised and poverty was reduced. Finally, the lessons learned and experience gained from the \nprevious railway projects have been incorporated in the project design.  \n \n5.  Rationale \n19.  The  project  rationale  reflects  both  network  development  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. The largely mountainous project area is not integrated into the economic mainstream \npartly because of inadequate transportation. The existing Class II road passes through difficult \nterrain, has limited passing capacity, and is occasionally affected by rain. In spite of abundant \nnatural resources, many of the people living in this area are poor. Most people living in the area \nwork  in  agriculture,  which  is  characterized  by  a  low  level  of  profitability.  People  living  in \nmountainous areas supplement their incomes by engaging in animal husbandry or becoming \nmigrant laborers. The economic growth  necessary to ameliorate rural poverty has failed to \ndevelop,  partly  because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  transport  costs.  Local \ngovernments and people living in the project area see the railway as a key investment for \naddressing the problems of lagging economic development and poverty.  \n \n20.  The railway link provides connectivity from northwestern Yunnan province to Kunming, \nShanghai, and Beijing via three of the 16 east-west and north-south national rail corridors. This \nwill provide accessibility to the ports of Fangcheng and Beihai. The Project will also help in \npromoting the regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), of which the PRC \nis  an  active  participant  through  Yunnan  province,  which  shares  borders  with  other  GMS \ncountries. Through the rail network, the project area will be linked to the port of Haiphong in Viet \nNam and the Pan-Asian railway. \n \n21.  The Project and associated developments are expected to stimulate industrial and \nnatural resource development as well as tourism and related industries, generate employment, \nincrease living standards, and help reduce poverty. The Project is a part of the Government's \n                                                 \n13  The Jing-Jiu Railway facilitated setting up a large number of resource- and agriculture-based industries in \nXingfeng county of Jiangxi province. Their number increased from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after  project \ncompletion. The number of businesses grew from 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons \nemployed in these increased from 18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998, an annual increase of 23%. In the same \ncounty the number of people living below the poverty line reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a \ndecline by 62%. \n14  Beneficial income and social impacts particularly on women were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu-\nMaoming Railway (footnote 7) and Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 7).  \n ", "  7 \nprogram  for  the  integrated  development  of  transportation  facilities,  including  upgrading  of \nhighways  and  constructing  local  roads.  Other  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and \ninvestment to improve education and health care facilities, is also planned. The railway will play \nan important role in facilitating the integration of this poor and underdeveloped region, with the \ndeveloped parts of the PRC.  \n \n22.  The Project railway will be a joint-venture railway by the MOR and Yunnan provincial \ngovernment (YPG). Joint-venture railways, which account for 7,700 km (in 2003) of the total \nlength of the PRC\u2019s system, have substantial managerial and financial autonomy. This includes \nthe freedom to set tariffs, which are several times higher than those of the national network. \nFreight and passenger traffic on joint-venture railways has grown faster than on the national \nrailways. Between 1996 and 2002, passenger traffic grew by 32% (passenger-km) and freight \nby 20.5% (ton-km) annually as compared with an annual growth rate of 6.8% for passengers \nand 3% for freight on the national railway network. Joint-venture railways are more efficient \nemployers than the national railways: there are 5\u20138 people per km employed by joint-venture \nrailways compared with 30 people per km for the national railways.  \n \n23.  The Project will pursue operational reforms, including an emphasis on safety and the \nintroduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  and  introducing  modern \ndispatch control systems and high-quality information systems on the railway network. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n24.  The main objective of the Project  is to remove a transport constraint to sustainable \neconomic growth, thereby helping increase living standards and reduce poverty in the Project \narea. This will be achieved by providing affordable railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped areas to create the conditions necessary for developing local resources and for \ngenerating employment and income-enhancing opportunities.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n25.  The Project will construct 167 km of single-track, standard gauge, Class I railway, \nreserved for electrification, between Dali and Lijiang, and expand the capacity of the existing \nGuangtong\u2013Dali line (Guangda line) to accommodate additional traffic. The Project comprises \nthe following components: (i) laying railway track consisting of rails and accessories, concrete \nsleepers, and stone ballast; (ii) constructing 11 new railway stations complete with facilities; \n(iii) a safety component that includes providing modern technology and equipment for signaling, \ncommunications,  a  dispatch  management  information  system,  freight  yard  operation, \noperational safety equipment, mechanized maintenance of tracks; (iv) installing e-governance \nand management information systems, including computerization and linking Dali and Lijiang to \nthe national railway network; (v) supply of environmental mitigation and protection equipment \nand facilities; (vi) training on the use and maintenance of equipment provided under the Project; \nand (vii) strengthening institutional capacity of MOR and WYRC. The key inputs needed to \nimplement the Project include civil works, equipment, consultants, and staff of MOR and WYRC.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  Subregional Context. Although not a GMS initiative, the Project will promote regional \ncooperation  in  the  GMS.  The  Yuxi-Mengzi (Kunming-Hekou) railway project is planned for \nconstruction  in  2005  (under  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan).  A  link  from  Dali-Ruili,  and  from \nXishangbanna to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), is included for construction \n ", "8   \nin the railway development plan (up to 2020). These three links will provide direct rail links to the \nproposed DLR to south and southeast Asia through Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. The \nimproved  connectivity  will  promote  cross-border  trade  and  stimulate  industrial  and  natural \nresource development, as well as tourism and related development in the region. The Project \nwill provide direct link to the port of Haipong in Viet Nam and to the proposed Pan Asian \nRailway (Singapore-Kunming Railway) and the road network in Yunnan extending to Lao, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam, thereby promoting multi-modal transport in the region (see map). \n \n27.  Cofinancing. ADB helped introduce Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to \nPRC officials and this is the first railway project in the PRC to be cofinanced by AFD. AFD will \ncofinance $40 million (joint cofinancing) equivalent of the project cost. \n  \n28.  Safety. The PRC railway network is undergoing major  technological and operational \nchanges. Improved safety is an important aspect of such development. As part of ADB\u2019s policy \ndialogue, emphasis has been placed on introducing operational reforms in the railway network. \nThis includes introducing safe and reliable technology, modernizing the maintenance systems, \nand monitoring safety performance. A separate component of $10 million equivalent (of which \n$7.3 million will be financed by the ADB loan) is included in the Project to promote and enhance \nproject  railway  safety.  This  component  will  finance  the  procurement of maintenance and \noperational equipment that will enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \n29.  E-Governance and MIS. As part of its railway sector involvement, ADB is pursuing the \nintroduction of modern management systems and high-quality information systems. Since this is \na relatively small railway, stand-alone systems are proposed to be introduced as a pilot project. \nThese systems are scalable, and can be expanded for implementation. The Project will finance \nthe introduction of a modern DMIS and the linking of the  DLR reservation system with the \nnational train reservation system.  \n \n30.  Logistics Center. Container traffic has been growing at three times the rate of ordinary \nfreight traffic. A container terminal is planned for Kunming. Facilities for handling container traffic \nexist at Dali East station and these facilities will be set up under the Project at Lijiang to attract \nhigh-value traffic and to promote intermodal traffic. This will also encourage private sector \nshippers and freight forwarders to use the facilities for exporting and importing cargo. \n \n31.  Tourism. DLR  will support tourism development.  In 2003,  5.5 million domestic and \n140,000  international  tourists  visited  Dali,  generating  CNY2.56 billion  in  revenues.  About \n3.1 million  domestic  and  105,000  international  tourists  visited  Lijiang,  generating \nCNY2.04 billion. A separate component of $10 million is included in the project design to \npromote tourism through the procurement of special rolling stock (a \u201ctourist train\u201d) to cater to \ntourists. The consulting component will finance a study to: (i) identify how the private sector can \nbe involved, including franchising the services; and (ii) conduct a market survey and prepare a \nmarketing plan to attract tourists and other passengers.  \n \n32.   Private Sector. The Project will promote private sector initiatives such as onboard train \nservices, including catering, cleaning, and loading/unloading at freight yards. Activities such as \nmaintenance of tracks and power cables will be outsourced. Industrial sidings will be offered to \nlarge shippers and railway station space will be rented out through open bidding to private \nentrepreneurs to enhance their involvement and optimize the returns to the railway. Private \nsidings, hotels, restaurants, and other facilities will be encouraged in the vicinity of the railway \nstations to maximize economic returns.  \n \n ", "  9 \n33.   Reforms. ADB engaged MOR in discussions to enhance the policy reforms during \nproject processing and these discussions will continue during implementation. Consolidation of \nthe Guangda line into the proposed DLR will enhance the DLR\u2019s financial viability and provide \nmanagerial and operational flexibility. Specific measures to outsource to the private sector some \nof the activities hitherto handled by the railways are proposed under the Project. At the national \nlevel, MOR agreed to continue the process of separating the three large specialized companies, \nseparating core and noncore activities, and rationalizing staff. The Project will also bring in new \ntechnology, emphasize safety, and build capacity for MOR and the joint-venture railways. \n \n34.  Ethnic  Minorities  Development.  The Project will facilitate economic development, \nwhich will benefit the largely ethnic minority population, particularly the Bai and Naxi people. In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies,  an  ethnic  minorities  development  plan \n(EMDP) has been prepared to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated, and that \neconomic development benefits ethnic minorities in an equitable and sustainable manner. \nConsultations with ethnic minority communities have revealed strong support for the Project. \nThe  cost  of  implementing  the  EMDP  will  be  covered  by  the  project budget,  existing  local \ngovernment programs, and the small-scale TA. \n   \n35.  Stakeholder Consultation and Participation. Project preparation involved participatory \nprocesses. Extensive consultations were held with over 4,000 stakeholders, including various \nethnic minority groups (Bai, Naxi, Tibetans, Mosuo, Yi, and Lisu), nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), affected people, potential beneficiaries, monks, village leaders, local ethnic bureaus, \nand  local  governments  in  the  project  area  and  the  seven  neighboring  counties  (called \nboundaries of analysis or BOA).  Consultations included discussions on project alternatives, \nenvironmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, concerns of ethnic minorities, \nand economic development potential (Appendix 16). Over 75 village surveys and 800 household \nsurveys  were  carried  out  to:  (i) understand  public  opinion  about  the  proposed  railway, \n(ii) provide  inputs  for  the  environmental  and  social  assessments,  and  (iii) prepare  the \nresettlement plan and EMDP.  Public opinion surveys were conducted with local residents, \ntourists, and other stakeholders. EIA consultation workshops were held in Dali and Lijiang. In \nAugust 2004, a well-publicized and interactive consultation workshop was held in the project \narea (Dali) to present the draft EMDP, resettlement plan, and the EIA and to discuss findings \nfrom the consultants\u2019 studies in the BOA. In general,  there was widespread support for the \nProject and people look forward to the opportunities that will be generated by it. The workshop \nand its outputs were well publicized in local media, including newspapers. During project \nimplementation, participation of local people will be encouraged to improve the distribution of \nbenefits. Local groups and government agencies, including the All-China Women\u2019s Federation \nand the provincial ethnic affairs bureau, have played and will continue to play key roles in the \nprocess of consultation and participation. \n \n36.  Employment Opportunities for Local People. An average of 27,670 person-years of \nwork will be created per year  during construction. Of this, about 60% will be for unskilled \nlaborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor ethnic minority households. Priority will \nbe given to women and resettlement-affected  people. Contractors will conduct  training for \nsemiskilled and skilled equipment operators and construction workers in the project area during \nthe first year of project implementation. In addition, local people meeting a minimum education \nstandard will be eligible  for a WYRC training course. On  the basis of newly acquired skills, \nworkers will be in a position to put themselves forward for other construction work. The use of \nlocally produced materials for railway construction will generate additional employment during \nrailway construction. The county poverty reduction offices will tailor some of their programs to \n ", "10   \nensure that there are sustained gains from employment in tourism, local freight transport and \nwarehousing, and other areas of induced economic development. \n \n37.  Railway  Station  Area  Development.  The  Project  includes  the  construction  of  11 \nrailway stations, including roads connecting the stations to the nearest county or township. The \nrailway stations, including their surrounding areas, have the potential to promote local business, \nincome-generating  activities,  and  revenues  for  local  communities.  The  stations  will  be \ndeveloped with the participation of local communities. Station area development will stimulate \nlocal earnings, particularly for the poor and ethnic minorities, as they can sell their goods, \nhandicrafts, and services.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n38.  The  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  is  estimated  at \n$548 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange costs of $236.2 million (43%) and local \ncurrency costs of $311.8 million equivalent (57%) (Table 1). Details are in Appendix 7. The cost \nestimates are based on quantities derived from preliminary engineering designs and unit rates, \nreflecting market prices for goods and materials, and including the costs of land acquisition, \ncompensation, resettlement, environmental mitigation measures, and environmental monitoring. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign  Local \nItem  Exchange Currency Total Cost \nA.

The  Government  has  requested  a  $180 million  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The PRC will be the Borrower. The loan will finance the \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  civil  works,  railway  materials,  equipment,  safety  component, \ne-governance  and  MIS  component,  environmental  protection  measures,  and  consulting \nservices; and will cover 76% of the total foreign cost and 33% of the total project cost. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum, conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with \nADB\u2019s loan regulations and conversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decisions to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms \nand conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were independently made, not \ninfluenced by any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n ", "  11 \n40.  The Government had also requested AFD to provide  \u20ac33.5 million (about $40 million \nequivalent) to finance part of the cost of civil works.15 The proceeds from AFD\u2019s loan will be \napplied to three civil works contracts where they will complement ADB\u2019s loan proceeds up to \n100% of costs. The local currency cost of $311.8 million equivalent and foreign exchange cost \nof  $16.2 million  equivalent,  which  represent  the  interest  and  commitment  charges  during \nconstruction on the ADB and AFD loans, will be financed 70% by MOR and 30% by YPG. A \nsummary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and the details are in Appendix 7. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total Cost  % \nADB  180.0  0.0  180.0  33 \nAFD  40.0  0.0  40.0  7 \nMOR  11.3  218.3  229.6  42 \nYPG  4.9  93.5  98.4  18 \n     Total  236.2  311.8  548.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nMOR = Ministry of Railways, YPG = Yunnan provincial government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n41.  The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan will be made available to WYRC on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. WYRC will bear the interest rate variation and foreign \nexchange risks. Assurance was obtained from the Government that the counterpart funds \nrequired to implement the Project, including those to cover physical and price contingencies, will \nbe made available on time. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n42.  WYRC will be the Executing Agency (EA) responsible for overall implementation of the \nProject, setting up of the on-site construction management units along the project route, and \nreporting to ADB. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center under MOR shall coordinate \nthe  project  management  activities,  supervise  the  procurement  of  the  goods  and  services \nfinanced under the project, and review the reports to be submitted to ADB. The business license \nof  WYRC  was  issued  on  16  August  2004  and  includes  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement of the project railway. WYRC will manage and operate the Guangtong to Lijiang \nrailway after completion of construction. WYRC has the capacity to carry out sound and safe \nconstruction of the proposed railway, as well as operate and manage its financial resources \nefficiently.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n43.  The Project will be implemented over about 5 years starting from January 2005 to \nDecember  2009.  Land  acquisition  will  start  in  January  2005.  The  civil  works  under  ADB \nfinancing will start in June 2005 and will take about 3.5 years to complete. Trial operations will \n                                                 \n15  According to the tentative terms and conditions, the AFD loan would be based on 6-month euro interbank offered \nrate (Euribor) with a negative spread of 100 basis points and a 17-year maturity, including a grace period of \n5 years. \n ", "12   \nstart  in  January  2009  and  will  take  1  year  before  commercial  operations  begin.  The \nimplementation schedule is given in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  All  ADB  and  ADB-AFD  financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The civil works are divided into 12 packages. ADB will finance eight packages, to \nbe procured under international competitive bidding procedures, and four packages will be \n100%  financed  by  the  Government.  Three  of  the  eight  ADB-financed  packages  will  be \ncofinanced  by  AFD  (joint  cofinancing).  Equipment  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  or  international  shopping  (IS)  (Appendix 9).  Contracts  valued  in \nexcess of $500,000 for goods and $5 million for civil works will be procured through ICB. Any \nsupply contracts not exceeding $500,000 will be procured through IS. Tendering companies, \nselected by the EA on a competitive basis, will handle the international bidding. Prequalified \ncontractors with adequate technical and financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several \npackages and, if successful, may be awarded more than one contract based on the least-cost \ncombination of contracts. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in \nall documents and contracts during bidding for, and implementation, of the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n45.  A total of 5,472 person-months of qualified domestic consultants will be engaged and \nfinanced  by  the  Government  for  (i) detailed  project  design;  (ii) international  procurement; \n(iii) construction supervision; (iv) construction quality assurance; (v) environmental supervision \nand management; (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement plan; (vii) advising on and \nmonitoring  the  EMDP;  and  (viii) socioeconomic  impact  assessment, evaluation of poverty \nreduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \n46.  The ADB loan will be used to finance 12 person-months of international consulting \nservices for (i) strengthening marketing and business development functions of WYRC, and \n(ii) researching and strengthening the development, operation, and management of the joint-\nventure railway systems in the PRC. The terms of reference for the international consultants, who \nwill be recruited as a firm using quality- and cost-based selection, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, are given in Appendix 10. The provisions of ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy will be included in all invitation documents and contracts for international \nconsultants.  \n \n5.  Advance Action \n47.  ADB approved advance procurement action for civil works on 15 June 2004 up to the \nevaluation of bids, which covers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation \nfor the civil works contract packages, but does not include award of contracts. The advance \naction  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project.16  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Since most of the payments will be made for large contracts well \nabove $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan \n                                                 \n16  The advance action was reported in the August 2004 issue of the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n ", "  13 \nfunds. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  WYRC will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an independent auditor and in accordance with \nauditing standards acceptable to ADB. WYRC will submit to ADB within 9 months after the end \nof each fiscal year certified copies of such audited project accounts and financial statements \nand auditor's reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements will also include: \n(i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to \nproject expenditures and other financial transactions; (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan \ncovenants and ADB's requirements on project management; and (iii) an opinion on the use of \nthe statement of expenditure procedure. WYRC will also submit  its consolidated financial \nstatements covering income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements to ADB \nwithin 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. To ensure that an effective internal control \nsystem and a checks and balances mechanism are put in place, WYRC will establish an internal \naudit unit within the company. The unit will independently test financial transactions to ensure \nthe safe custody of the project-financed assets and will report directly to WYRC's board of \ndirectors and external auditors. WYRC will make  satisfactory arrangements for reporting the \nprogress of project implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of \ncompletion, the EA will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Review \n50.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to the Project\u2019s goals, \npurposes, outputs, and conditions was agreed with MOR and WYRC. The indicators will be \nreviewed at the start of project implementation and will include (i) economic development and \nsocioeconomic indicators for the DLR, (ii) transport costs and times for passenger and freight \nservices, (iii) transport services offered and transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) financial \nsustainability, (vi) county/village incomes, (vii) access to social services, and (viii) jobs created \nin construction and maintenance (Appendix 11). At the beginning of project implementation, the \nDLR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured \nat project inception,  completion, and 3 years later, and compared with the baseline. Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  MOR/WYRC  will  recruit  qualified \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem, and train staff of WYRC in its use. The main sources of data include (i) secondary data \nfrom government sources, (ii) household socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory \nrapid appraisal. A report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, \nand 3 years later will be submitted to ADB. \n \n51.  In 2007, ADB, MOR, and WYRC will carry out a midterm review of the Project, covering \nall institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, \nresettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the \nperformance of the Project and its continuing viability.  \n \n9.  Anticorruption Measures \n52.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. ADB drew attention to the section, highlighting the section on fraud and \ncorruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe \n ", "14   \nthe highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, \nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Based on MOR\u2019s experience in fighting \ncorruption, the following actions will be taken to prevent corruption:  (i) a leading group of \nofficials from the discipline unit and supervision department of MOR will be resident in project \noffices for bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) a supervisory \"watchdog\" body has been \nestablished to prevent interference in the processes; and (iii) briefings between MOR and the \nprosecutor's office are held on a regular basis where warnings about or information on corrupt \npractices can be discussed.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n53.  Since the Project is located in an area that is predominantly inhabited with poor people, \nmost of whom are ethnic minorities, the Government requested ADB to provide a small-scale \ntechnical assistance (TA) to enhance the project benefits to the poor, and ethnic minorities, and \nassist in the preservation of local culture. The small-scale TA will have three components and \nassist the local governments in (i) capacity building and skill enhancement programs for the \npoor, vulnerable groups, and ethnic minorities, particularly with regard to income generation, \nsustainability, cultural tourism and eco-tourism; (ii) undertaking feasibility studies for cultural \nprotection and preservation; and (iii) assessing measures taken or planned for the preservation \nof  local  cultures,  and  recommendation  of  further  measures,  if  any,  required  prior  to  the \ncompletion of the Project. International and domestic consultants providing a total of 16 person-\nmonths with skills in social development, design of vocational training programs, community-\nbased tourism, cultural tourism, and cultural preservation will be hired. The $150,000 small-\nscale TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The outline of the \nsmall-scale TA is in Appendix 12. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n54.  The traffic forecast was made by considering expected economic growth, population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand the assessment of TA consultants and the ADB mission. The freight volume on the DLR is \nforecast to increase from about 640 million ton-km in 2010 to 1,457 million ton-km in 2025. The \nannual growth rate will range between 4.5% and 6.4%. Passenger traffic was forecast based on \nsimilar factors, including an assessment of tourism development potential.17 It was forecast to \ngrow  from  448 million  passenger-km  in  2010  to  1,234 million  passenger-km  in  2025  with \naverage growth rate ranging between 6.5% and 7.3%. These estimates take into consideration \nthe lessons learned from previous railway projects and are consistent with the growth achieved \non the Guangda railway. The projected volumes can be accommodated on the DLR and justify \nconstruction of the Project. Details are given in Appendix 13. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. DLR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor, landlocked \npart of northwestern Yunnan province. The economic costs of the Project reflect the costs for \nconstruction, operation and maintenance, and the value of agricultural production from land lost \npermanently. The economic benefits include (i) operating cost savings in freight and passenger \ntraffic, (ii) time saving in diverted passenger traffic from buses, (iii) the net economic value \n                                                 \n17  Lijiang is officially designated as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization world heritage \nsite. \n ", "  15 \nadded of generated commodity production, (v) generated passenger benefits, and (vi) tourism \nbenefits. The EIRR for the Project is 17%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n(Appendix 13). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in benefits, do not significantly \nimpact economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 54% over the estimate for \nthe EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 29% \nto achieve the same effect. In light of previous experience in the PRC railway sector, variations \nof such magnitude are unlikely. Project risks were quantified using the \u201cMonte Carlo\u201d method, \ni.e., considering the possible value for key variables and the probability with which they may \noccur. The result shows that the EIRR would exceed 12% with 95% probability. Distribution \nanalysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries, which shows that a large portion of  the net benefits will accrue to the local \neconomy. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits  \n56.  Financial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  WYRC  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nADB  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway  (Appendix 14). The \nprojected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \noperation and maintenance costs, income taxes, and debt service, and provide  a reasonable \nrate of return. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 prices. \nThe project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real \nterms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  under  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.7%. \nThis compares favorably with the average weighted average cost of capital, also computed on \nan after-tax basis, of 4.5%. The Project is both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and \nrisk analysis indicates that the FIRR for the Project is robust under most conditions. The \ndetailed evaluation is provided in Appendix 14. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n57.  The Project is classified as environmental category A. The Second Survey and Design \nInstitute Environmental Engineering Division prepared an EIA for the proposed project, which \nwas  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  on  26  October  2004.  The \nsummary EIA was endorsed by the MOR and circulated to ADB\u2019s Board and uploaded on the \nADB web site on 15 July 2004.  \n \n58.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include:  (i) clearing  of  vegetation, \n(ii) management  of  excavated  rock  and  soil  wastes,  and  (iii) induced  impacts  related  to \nsecondary tourism and industrial development. Institutional arrangements for environmental \nmanagement, monitoring, reporting, and oversight are summarized in the summary EIA. The \nEIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully  mitigated. \nImplementation  of  the  environmental  management,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  programs \nincluded in the EIA will ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and procedures of \nADB and the Government. MOR/WYRC agreed that the anticipated industrial development \nwould be subject to a stringent environmental review and approval process, whereby a project \nnormally approved at county level would be approved at city level, and a project normally \napproved at provincial level would be approved at state level.  \n \n ", "16   \n59.  A qualitative review of potential induced impacts in the project area and BOA was \nundertaken.  The  EIA  included  an  evaluation  of  the  impacts  of  tourism,  urbanization,  and \nindustrial development. The evaluation noted that (i) the ongoing development activities are \nadequately managed with respect to environmental protection, (ii) the institutional capacity for \nenvironmental protection is adequate, and (iii) the ongoing environmental protection programs \nare consistent with PRC and ADB requirements. Based on the analysis, ADB agreed with the \nGovernment that (i) the Project  will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in \naccordance with the environmental laws and regulations of the PRC and the  environmental \npolicy of ADB; (ii) the environmental management and monitoring program (EMP) and the \nmitigation measures included therein, as specified in the EIA prepared for the Project, are \nproperly implemented; (iii) any environmental permits, licenses, and clearances are obtained in \na timely manner; (iv) any adverse impact on the environment that may arise from project \nimplementation activities is promptly mitigated or minimized in accordance with the EMP; and \n(v) the implementation of the EMP, including any safety breaches, violation of environmental \nstandards,  and  the  necessary  corrective  measures  are  reported  regularly  to  ADB.  The \nevaluation  also  noted  that  there  is  substantial  external  assistance  for  environmental \nmanagement efforts, particularly for environmental preservation, in northwestern Yunnan.  An \nindependent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out the external monitoring and evaluation \nwork during project implementation. \n \nE.  Impacts on Poverty  \n60.  The Project will benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area. Of them, about 75% \nare rural and 30% are poor with an average net income per capita of less than CNY900. A total \nof 372 key poverty reduction villages are located in the project area, of which 27 villages are \nlocated in the project railway corridor townships. The Project will also benefit the people living in \nthe BOA, where 91% of the population is rural and the poverty incidence is more than 60%. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 18. \n \n61.  About 96,800 person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway, \nwhich will provide direct employment opportunities to over 7,000 poor people. A majority will be \nethnic  minorities  and  priority  will  be  given  to  women  and  resettlement-affected people. In \naddition, during construction, 8,505 person-years of local jobs will be created in the provision of \nconstruction material. When the operation of the new railway starts, approximately 300 people \nwill be employed, creating 7,500 person-years of work over a 25-year time horizon, of which \nabout  2,000  person-years  would  be  available  to  poor  people.  The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction of 251 km of access roads, which will be handed over to the local governments at \nthe end of construction. The access roads will facilitate the spread of the railway\u2019s benefits to \nthe rural economy. By lowering transport costs and travel time along the corridor, the Project will \nimprove the availability of daily necessities in local markets and villages, and access to markets \nfor local produce, and income-generating opportunities. The construction of 11 railway stations \nwill create permanent and support jobs, and help distribute the benefits in the project area. \nThere will be sufficient space in and around the stations for local area development and ethnic \nminorities will be supported to set up shops, sell local produce, handicrafts, and local goods. \nThis will increase income in local communities and help generate local revenue, which can be \nused to improve social services and local infrastructure. The Project will provide the essential \ninfrastructure upon which the local authorities plan to build and improve a wide range of social \nand economic services such as public utilities, and health and education services.  \n \n62.  The Project will provide efficient and low-cost transportation for passengers and goods. \nBetter passenger transport will help manage the projected increase in tourists visiting the project \narea each year. Dali and Lijiang will have higher levels of economic development because of \n ", "  17 \nthe expansion of tourism. The competitiveness of market access to locally produced goods will \nincrease, thus generating economic development in the project area. The Project will also \nfacilitate the development of local industry and tourism, which will  help generate additional \nopportunities in the future for the vast majority of local people who, being ethnic  minorities, \nprefer to remain in their native lands. The Project will improve their living standards without their \nhaving to migrate. In summary, the Project will contribute to achieving the goals of increasing \nincomes and reducing poverty. \n \nF.  Resettlement Impact   \n63.  The railway alignment will cross 56 villages in 13 townships from Dali city to Lijiang city. \nThe railway lengths in Dali  prefecture and Lijiang  city are 138 km and 28 km, respectively. \nBased on the field survey of the first stage of the preliminary design study, the total permanent \nacquisition of land is 394 hectares. About 70% of the land  to be permanently  acquired is \ncurrently under cultivation, affecting 4,159 people (assuming total loss of cultivated land on the \nbasis of average per capita landholdings). The houses of 3,150 rural people (680 households) \nwill be demolished. During construction, temporary land occupation of about 107 ha will affect \nanother 250 people. The relocation of one school and a brick-kiln will require 594 square meters \nand affect an additional  150 people. In total, 7,709 people will be directly affected. Ethnic \nminorities account for 83% of the affected people, including Bai, Lisu, and Naxi villages. The \nrailway alignment was selected to minimize resettlement  impacts, where possible. Special \nmeasures have been included in the resettlement plan and the EMDP to ensure compliance \nwith ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \n64.  The budget approved by the National Development and Reform Commission for land \nacquisition and resettlement is CNY141 million ($17.1 million). The resettlement budget will be \nadjusted  based  on  the  actual  measurement  of  physical  losses.  MOR,  WYRC,  and  local \ngovernments prepared and finalized the resettlement plan with assistance from the project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants and South West Jiaotong University based \non the preliminary design study, 20 village surveys, 218 household surveys, local government \nstatistics, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. WYRC \nhas distributed resettlement information booklets in Chinese to all affected villages to inform the \naffected people of the compensation standards. The final resettlement plan in Chinese has been \ncirculated at the prefecture, county, and township levels. A Summary resettlement plan was \nuploaded on the ADB web site on 15 July 2004. MOR, YPG and WYRC will be responsible for \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. The Dali prefecture and Lijiang city governments will \nbe responsible for (i) provision of livelihood training, support for vulnerable groups, and meeting \nany cost overruns; and (ii) construction of access roads to stations and ensuring support \ninfrastructure  for  station  area  development.  An  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \ncontracted to carry out the external monitoring and evaluation work. MOR, WYRC, and ADB \nhave agreed on a set of supervision milestones, which are shown in the Summary Resettlement \nPlan (Appendix 15).  \n \nG.  Ethnic Minorities \n65.    In the project area, about 73% of the total population consists of ethnic minorities. Of \nthe total population, the largest ethnic group is the Bai (46.2%), followed by Han (26.7%), Naxi \n(18.3%), Yi (3.2%), Lisu (2.8%) and others (2.8%)18. The project will have potential adverse \nimpacts in terms of resettlement, mainly on the Bai people (74.3%) and also some Han (16.8%), \n                                                 \n18  About 2,800 Tibetans reside in the project area (0.2% of population). They live in Lijiang city and Dali city, and are \nengaged in business in the tourist areas. \n ", "18   \nNaxi (6.2%), Yi (1.5%), and Lisu (0.4%) people. Specific provisions to address land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts are included in the resettlement plan. To assess the potential induced \nimpacts, people and NGOs within the seven BOA counties have also been interviewed and \nconsulted. These seven counties have many ethnic groups, including Tibetans19 in Xianggelila \ncounty (Zhongdian), Yi and Miao in Lijiang prefecture, and Pumi and Mosuo in Ninglang county. \nThe results of these studies showed strong support for the railway and economic development \nin general. The local people believe that the DLR is an important project that will benefit the \narea.  The  evaluation  also  noted  that  there  is  substantial  external  assistance  for  poverty \nreduction, and social development in northwestern Yunnan, and saw the Project as a key \ndevelopment investment, the positive social impacts of which are expected to substantially \noutweigh the negative ones. \n \n66.  Given the large number of ethnic minorities in the project area and BOA, the social \nanalysis focused on ethnic minorities, and a stand-alone EMDP was prepared for the Project. A \ndraft EMDP was prepared by the PPTA consultants after extensive consultations with various \nstakeholders  including  all  minority  groups  in  the  project  area.  In  addition  to  the  PPTA \nconsultants, three consultants including two Tibetans were hired to look at possible impacts in \nthe BOA. Consultations included household interviews, village group meetings, meeting with \nNGOs, monks, local ethnic bureaus, village leaders, and other stakeholders. Participatory \nworkshops were organized to disseminate the findings of the EMDP. The draft EMDP was \ndistributed in Chinese to local people and refined based on further consultations, including a \npublic consultation workshop in Dali on 20 August 2004. The finalized EMDP was endorsed by \nMOR, WYRC, and YPG. \n   \n67.  WYRC will have overall responsibility for the EMDP and will carry out implementation in \ncoordination with MOR and YPG. The cost of implementing the EMDP will be covered by the \nproject budget, by existing local government programs, and the small-scale TA. The EMDP \nincludes  a  participatory  strategy,  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan.  The  construction \nmanagement  units  established  by  WYRC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  supervision  and \nmonitoring of the implementation of the EMDP. An independent local institute will act as the \nexternal monitor. A summary EMDP is included in Appendix 17. The EMDP is available in the \nlocal language (Chinese) at the prefecture, county, and township levels.  \n \nH.  Social and Gender Aspects   \n68.  Vulnerable  groups  in  the  project  area  include  orphans,  widows,  and  the  seriously \ndisabled  and  mentally  ill.  The  Project  will  generate  job  opportunities  for  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, women, and other vulnerable groups, and will help develop their job skills. Station \narea development, including station access roads,  will help  address the needs of  the poor, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  Sufficient  areas  will  be \ndesignated for the establishment of shops for the affected villages. Construction and operation-\nrelated jobs will provide potential new sources of income for local people. Women and other \nvulnerable groups will benefit from project-generated employment, afforestation activities, and \nexpansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries,  especially  tourism.  An  increase  in  female \nparticipation in the labor and tourism market has the potential of increasing women\u2019s net income \nand savings potential, improving overall family welfare, and improving the status of women.  \n \n69.  Although, the proposed DLR is not in a high HIV/AIDS epidemic area, the construction of \nthe DLR and the operation of the railway may have an impact on the transmission of HIV/AIDS \n                                                 \n19  There are 141,000 Tibetans residing in Yunnan province, of whom 115,000 are in Diqing prefecture; most of this \narea is included in the BOA of the proposed railway project. \n ", "  19 \nand sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to a large number of workers during construction, \nexpansion of the tourism industry, and lack of adequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS. However, \nthe poverty and social assessment noted that  MOR and Guangda Railway Corporation have \nexperience  from  implementing  various  awareness  and  prevention  programs  during  the \nconstruction of the Guangda railway. Medical clinics were established in the area of construction \ncamps, which have subsequently become hospitals. A unit within Guangda Railway Corporation \norganized  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  and  preventive  measures  for  workers  and \ncommunities during railway construction. These activities will be continued by WYRC during the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  DLR.  The  unit  will  coordinate  with  contractors,  the  local \ndepartments of health, and other relevant line agencies (e.g., All-China Women\u2019s Federation \nand  ethnic  affairs  bureau)  in  delivering  appropriate  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \ninformation  to  construction  workers,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women.  When combined with \nincreased awareness efforts by local governments and the Ministry of Health, such measures \nwill minimize potential risks of STI/HIV/AIDS transmission along the railway corridor. \n \nI.  Risks \n70.  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with \nprevious railway projects, traffic demand was conservatively estimated. The forecast for freight \ntraffic  was  adjusted  for  the  initial  years  of  operation  based  on  generally  slower  growth \nexperienced  on  previous  railway  projects.  Sensitivity  tests  indicated  that  economic \ncircumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the Project to lose economic \nviability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization of benefits. \nMOR and WYRC have successfully built railway lines over difficult terrain, such as the Nanning-\nKunming railway, and the Guangtong-Dali railway. The support that the Project has from the \nGovernment, MOR, and YPG; the thorough preparation of the Project; and the approval of \nadvance  procurement  action,  all  contribute  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  delays  in \nimplementation. The environmental risks will be mitigated by the measures agreed to in the \nenvironmental management plan and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n71.  Resettlement will affect about 8,000 people. The railway alignment has been routed to \ncause  minimal  resettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for \nemployment during construction, supply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near \nrailway stations, and job training. There is a potential risk that the economic development may \nhave some indirect, adverse impacts for some ethnic minorities. To mitigate this, special \nmeasures have been included in the EMDP. Both the resettlement plan and EMDP will be \nclosely monitored to ensure compliance with ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \n72.  Intermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks to the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and the capacity constraint is expected \nto worsen, as there are no current plans to improve the road. Surveys of freight operators and \npassengers indicated that the railway has several advantages over other transport modes: lower \nfares, shorter travel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the \njoint-venture railway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and WYRC have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n ", "20   \n(i)  Cofinancing.

Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key  Features.  Despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport \ncapacity,  serious  constraints  and  bottlenecks  remain,  especially  in  the  road  and  railway \nsubsectors.  By  the  end  of  2002,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system \ncomprised about 72,000 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.69 million km of highways, 121,500 km of \ninland  waterways,  and  1.55 million km  of  civil  aviation  routes.  However,  the  density  of  the \ntransport network ranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic \narea. From 1978, when economic reforms were first introduced, through to 2003, the PRC \nexperienced sustained rapid economic growth. This resulted in an accordingly rapid increase in \ndemand for transportation. The annual growth of passenger transport was 9.2% and freight \ntransport grew at 7.1% during the 1978\u20132003 period. In 2003, road traffic accounted for 55.79% \nof total passenger-km, followed by railways with 34.7%, civil aviation with 9.1%, and coastal and \ninland waterways with 0.5%. The modal split for freight ton-km was 53.3% for coastal and inland \nwaterways, 32% for railways, 13.2% for roads, 1.4% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n2.  Recent Developments. To improve transport inefficiencies and eliminate the transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased \ninvestment in transport infrastructure in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000). Investment in \ntransport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) more than doubled in the last \ndecade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport investment should be increased to at \nleast 3.8% of GDP to avoid the economic costs associated with transport constraints. To meet the \nincrease in transport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. The Government has \ncontinued to accord high priority to transport in the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Substantial \ninvestments in the road and railway subsectors from both domestic and international financing \nsources, including the private sector, are envisaged. \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. The 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) \nidentifies  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  Plan  envisages \n(i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access to unserved areas with the network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km,  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion on capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling \nstock,  is  planned  for  the  railway  sector.  During  2003\u20132007,  the  investments  for  capital \nconstruction are expected to reach CNY450 billion.  \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 km to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to the development of \nrailways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nThe route network length will reach 16,000 km in the western region of the PRC by 2020. The \nplan also calls for separating passenger and freight traffic in heavily trafficked corridors. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Report No. 1595-CHA \nTransport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, Washington, DC. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of the national railways. In the past \n20 years, JBIC has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, \nparticularly in major coal transport corridors. JBIC has also financed the development of new \nsections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has \nprovided 10 loans totaling $2.4 billion for nine national railway projects and one local railway \nproject. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s  Assistance  in  the  Sector.  In  the  railway  subsector,  ADB  has  focused  on \nimproving infrastructure in less-developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 11 loans totaling about $2.1 billion to \nhelp finance the construction of 1,754 km of new railway lines under seven local railway \nprojects, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under four national railway projects. These projects \nhave introduced modern technology and improved the efficiency of railway operation through \ninstitutional and structural reforms.  ADB has also provided 10 TAs totaling $4.6 million, to \npromote the commercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost \nrecovery, and improve the management of railways.  \n \n7.  Evaluation of ADB Assistance. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe executing agencies (EAs) for project implementation. The speed of implementation has \noften exceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal. The EAs generally complied with the \nloan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management were carried out satisfactorily. \nAudited financial statements were submitted in a timely manner, and the audited financial \nstatements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 11 railway projects, 5 are complete, 3 \nare under trial operation, and 6 are under implementation. The key lessons from the previous \nrailway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that the EA established for project processing \nand implementation is also responsible for the project\u2019s operation; (ii) prepare realistic traffic \nforecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on project viability \nof the existing and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that may compete \nwith the project facilities; and (iv) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt-\nequity  ratios.  The  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  transformation  of  local \neconomies. The per capita rural incomes in the project areas increased substantially from the \nlevels before the project. Living standards were raised and poverty was reduced. The project \nperformance audit report2 for the ADB-financed Jing-Jiu railway project in the PRC concluded that \nthe project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Subsector Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy  and Priorities.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway subsector has three broad \nobjectives: (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to \nreduce poverty, and (iii) protect the environment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  developing  efficient  and  integrated  transport \nnetworks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty \nthrough  investment  targeting  poorer  areas  coupled  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nBecause of  the importance of railway transport in the development of the national economy, \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Jing-Ju Railway Technical Enhancement Project. Manila. December 2002.  \n ", "Appendix 3  29 \nADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing \nnew lines in unserved areas that are less-developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and increasing \nthe capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway system, \n(iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty Reduction. ADB focuses on four issues to enhance the poverty reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in the less-developed and \npoor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development,  (ii) encouraging  the \nmaximization  of  employment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operations, \n(iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from poor \nvillages, and (iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen the project\u2019s benefits to \npoor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and  Policy Reform Agenda. ADB\u2019s policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11.  Promoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes toward the capital markets. In the \nrailway sector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create \nthe  conditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include construction of industrial \nsidings, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives: (i) through Yunnan province for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), (ii) through \nthe  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  initiative,  and \n(iii) through  Inner  Mongolia  with  Mongolia.  Improving  the  cross-border  trade  regimes  is  a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. An agreement for facilitating \nthe cross-border movement of goods and people has been developed under the GMS initiative. \nSteps are being taken to develop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of \nregional transport projects, e.g., the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyz Republic-PRC railway development and \nthe Pan-Asian railway project (Singapore-Kunming Railway Link project). \n \nE.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The sector performance is \nmonitored and evaluated annually by the Government and reviewed through the process of the \ncountry strategy and program. A set of indicators for evaluating sector performance includes \n(i) economic development and poverty indicators for the western region, (ii) transport density in \nrelation to land area and population, (iii) public and private investment in railways, (iv) transport \ndemand for freight and passengers with modal split data, (v) level of user charges (railway \nconstruction surcharges, etc.), and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the CARs, GMS, and \nMongolia. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3: Railway Subsector Road Map \n \n  Indicators \nItem  5 Years \n2003  5 Years Later \nAgo \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  West  Yunnan  Railway  Company  (WYRC)  is  implementing  the  Dali\u2013Lijiang Railway \n(DLR) Project that will link Dali with Lijiang in Yunnan province. The objective of the Project is to \npromote  sustainable  economic  growth  by  enhancing  transportation  capability  in  a  less \naccessible  and  mountainous  region,  thereby  creating  employment  and  income-enhancing \nopportunities,  raising  incomes,  and  reducing  poverty.  To  achieve  this  objective,  economic \ndevelopments, such as tourism, as well as value-added and labor-intensive industries, need to \nbe facilitated in the project area. The construction of the DLR will create the conditions for a \nsignificant number of tourist and business companies to invest in the area. From the financial \nperspective of the DLR, tourism and industry on the route of the DLR will generate the greater \nproportion of the traffic. To capture the potential for economic development and traffic in the \nregion and foster railway-local industry cooperation, institutional strengthening in railway market \ndevelopment will be necessary. The purpose of the consulting services will be to assist the \nrailway in defining what the service should be, plan its future operations, and assist in creating \nappropriate customer-oriented services for the DLR.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  For the first component, the consultants will (i) determine the level of tourism, industry, \nand market development expertise in the WYRC; (ii) determine the programs and incentives \navailable for attracting industry at the county, prefecture, and province levels; (iii) meet with a \nselection of potential shippers located or planning to locate along the route of the DLR; (iv) meet \nwith business people of Kunming, Lijiang, and Dali to determine current operations and future \ninland transport requirements including for export to the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS); \n(v) develop plans for improving railway services, for passengers (particularly tourists) and freight \n(including  container  services);  (vi) propose  measures  to  develop  industrial  sidings;  and \n(vii) improve marketing of railway services to industries, specifically for the DLR and WYRC. \n \n3.  For the second component, the consultants will (i) review the performance of existing \njoint-venture railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), (ii) identify the areas that need \nto be strengthened, (iii) recommend actions and changes including institutional efforts to make \nthese joint-venture railways more market oriented and competitive, (iv) strengthen marketing and \nbusiness development functions of WYRC, and (v) research and strengthen the development, \noperation, and management of the joint-venture railway systems in the PRC. The international \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants.  \n \nC.  Expertise and Cost Estimates \n \n4.  About  12  person-months of international consulting services will be engaged under \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. The provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all invitation \ndocuments and contracts for international consultants. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in industrial development and marketing, international trade, and railway operation. \nThe loan will finance the services of the international consultants. \n  \n5.  WYRC will (i) assign appropriate counterpart staff to liaise with and facilitate the work of \nconsulting services; (ii) provide suitable office accommodation and communications facilities \ncommensurate  with  requirement;  (iii) assist  the  consultants  in  scheduling  field  visits  and \ndiscussions with field agencies in connection with the study;  and (iv) provide all facilities, \ndocumentation, and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the consultants to complete \nthe work.  \n ", " \nPROJECT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n4\n  0\n  M onTiotoorl ing  Populatio(nb,a psoevlienrety a Minncdaij dtoaerr ngInceedt ,if iclgiatuetrroearscs yt To r oab teeB  ein cMoorpnoitroarteedd  into PAM)    MAongietonrciyn g    AcAcoguenntcayb le    SRuebpmoritsisnigo nF rDeuqeu eDnactye             A\ng p\nn Infant mortality, maternal mortality, school enrollment  WYRC  WYRC  Annually   p\ni e\nor Number of hospitals/clinics, number of schools        nd\nit Update of poverty reduction program of each county        ix\ny  on GDP, GDP per capita, retail prices of a selection of commodities       (up to 3 years after physical   11\nainabilit  mic Meport    SLFoitxacetaidol  npa rsaiscreeet ae i nslacvnaedlsa tptmiroiecnne, stN ,f oelort  cirnoacal ogdmosv e e prnemr ceanpt irteav enue          c  ompletion)           \nust noR Number of registered enterprises  WYRC  WYRC   \nS o Number of township enterprises, Number of markets        \nc\ne Progress of development of local road network    The indicators will be collected \no\ni Road density by approximate distance from a station  for the following groups: \nc\no Number of villages without roads / safe water / electricity / telephone line   (i) sample on-route townships;  \nS\nNumber of HIV/AIDS cases in the project area.

Introduction \n \n1.  The objective of the Project is to promote sustainable economic growth by enhancing \ntransportation  capability  in  a  less  accessible  and  mountainous  region,  thereby  creating \nemployment and income-enhancing opportunities, raising incomes, and reducing poverty. Since \nthe Project is located in an area that is predominantly inhabited by ethnic minorities, an ethnic \nminorities development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to ensure compliance with the social \nsafeguard  policies  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  West  Yunnan  Railway \nCompany) has requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to enhance the project \nbenefits to the poor, most of whom are ethnic minorities, and assist in developing feasibility \nstudies for the preservation of local culture. The TA will  assist the local governments in the \nproject area in providing capacity building and training to the local people, help in the design \nand implementation of cultural preservation measures, and make a midterm assessment of \ncultural preservation. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  The scope of the consulting services has three components: (i) capacity building and \nskill enhancement programs for the poor, vulnerable groups, and ethnic minorities, particularly \nwith regard to income generation, sustainability, community-based tourism, and cultural tourism; \n(ii) feasibility studies for cultural protection and preservation; and (iii) an assessment of the \nmeasures taken or planned for the preservation of local cultures, and recommending further \nmeasures, if any, that are required to be taken prior to the completion of the Project.  \n \n3.  The capacity building and skill enhancement component would focus on (i) identifying \nthe tourism training needs, particularly for community-based tourism and for cultural tourism; \n(ii) identify people who can be trained, particularly among ethnic minorities and the vulnerable \nsector; (iii) formulate training plans, including identification of trainers; and (iv) commence a pilot \ntraining program. The key objective of this component will be to enhance the skills of local \npeople so that they can maximize the employment opportunities generated by the completion of \nthe Project. \n \n4.  There will be two feasibility studies and they will be focusing on the preservation or \nrestoration of ancient cultures. For the first feasibility study the consultants will conduct (i) a \nstudy on the protection of successor folk culture, and (ii) a study on the rescue and classification \nof ancient works. The objective of this feasibility study would be to assess opportunities to \nsupport artists within the project area, focusing primarily on the Bai and Naxi people (Dongba \nculture). The second feasibility study would focus on the identification, classification, translation, \nand restoration/preservation of ancient books, oral records, and inscriptions. The rescue work \nfor Dali and Lijiang ancient works requires more inputs. The two studies will recommend an \naction plan for implementation by the local governments.  \n \n5.  During the midterm review of the Project, an assessment will be made of the measures \ntaken  or  planned  for  the  preservation  of  local  cultures,  and  whether  such  measures  are \nadequate to achieve results given the pressures from economic development. Based on this \nassessment, the consultants will recommend further measures that are required to be taken \nprior to the completion of the Project by the local government. \n \n ", "Appendix 12   43\nC.

Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  The Dali\u2013Lijiang Railway (DLR) will connect  the  poor,  landlocked  part  of  northwestern \nYunnan province with the rest of the PRC through the existing  Guangtong\u2013Dali (Guangda) \nrailway, including Kunming, Fangcheng and Beihai ports, and Haiphong in Viet Nam. The \nproject area has industrial, natural resources, and tourism development potential. The Project \nwill also help promote regional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n2.  Freight traffic was forecast by commodity (i.e., coal, petroleum products, steel and \nnonferrous metal, metallic ore, nonmetallic ore, building material, cement, timber, chemicals, \nfoodstuffs,  and  others)  in  two  categories  differentiated  by  their  economic  impact:  (i) traffic \ndiverted from other modes, mainly roads, based on an assessment of the relative service and \ncost competitiveness of the DLR; and (ii) generated traffic that would only move because of the \nDLR. The traffic forecast was based on the model of the Second Survey and Design Institute \n(SSDI), that considered expected economic growth, population increase, tourism development \npotential, local government development plans, market surveys, and the judgment of technical \nassistance (TA) consultants and the ADB mission. Based on the work of the TA consultants and \nthe SSDI, the freight volume on the DLR is forecast to increase from about 640 million ton-\nkilometers (km) in 2010 to 1,457 million ton-km in 2025 with annual growth rates ranging from \n4.5% to 6.4%. Passenger traffic was forecast based on similar factors, with a particular focus on \ntourism  development  potential. 1  Passenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  from  448 million \npassenger-km in 2010 to 1,234 million passenger-km in 2025, with average annual growth rate \nranging from 6.5% to 7.3% (Table A13.1). \n \n3.  Transportation improvements will  facilitate the development of natural resources and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas, particularly in the tourism industry. Freight and passenger traffic forecasts are considered \nreasonable given that (i) the Guangda railway, an adjoining line to the DLR, has experienced a \nstrong growth (about 35% per annum) in the last 4 years; (ii) similar joint-venture railways in \nPRC have experienced high annual traffic growth (e.g., 26% for freight and 16% for passengers) \nand (iii) potential cross-border traffic would grow between Yunnan province and Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.  \n \nB.  Economic Evaluation \n \n4.  Cost. The economic evaluation was based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios, using constant 2004 economic prices. The project costs and benefits were revalued \nin  economic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic \nprice numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects.  A \nshadow price was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not \non wages for skilled labor since there is no clear surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate \nfactor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of \nlabor. \n \n5.  Benefits. The economic benefits consist of (i) operating cost savings in diverted freight \nand passenger traffic from roads, (ii) operating cost savings in generated passengers estimated \nby the difference between the railway and buses, (iii) time savings in diverted passenger traffic \nfrom the buses based on the value of time estimated from the net income of local residents, \n(iv) the net economic value calculated on the basis of the economic value per additional ton of \n                                                 \n1  Lijiang is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization world heritage site. \n ", "Appendix 13  45 \neach commodity of generated traffic as a result of the construction of the DLR, and (v) the net \neconomic value of generated tourist days by estimating the number of tourists and average \nexpenditure and considering the cost of providing the services for the tourists. The salvage \nvalue was calculated based on the economic life of each project component. \n \n6.  Least-Cost Analysis. Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected demand. It was considered viable to build a nonelectrified single-track railway in this \ncorridor  to  meet  the  anticipated  traffic  demand  at  this  stage,  given  the  railway  network \ndevelopment,  type  of  cargos  and  passengers,  and  the  energy  efficiency.  Six  alternative \nalignments were subsequently evaluated during feasibility study for the following sections: along \nErhai  Lake,  Haidong-Wenbi,  Haidong-Wase,  Bijia  mountain  tunnels,  Xiyi-Changtou,  and \nChangtou-Lijiang south. Criteria adopted for this purpose included railway length, cost estimates, \nlength  and  difficulty  of  the  construction  of  bridges  and  tunnels,  construction  period,  and \nenvironmental and social impacts, including resettlement. \n \n7.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17% (Table \nA13.3). Benefits from the freight traffic, including generated commodity production,  are the \nmajor economic benefit (80%), followed by  passenger benefits (14%), and tourism benefits \n(6%). Sensitivity analysis tested seven scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the \neconomic analysis (Table A13.4). The capital cost would have to be more than 54% higher than \nestimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the past experience of \nADB-financed projects in the  railway sector, this switching value is unlikely to occur. ADB-\nfinanced railway  projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost overruns, and the \ncontract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting process is becoming \nincreasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more than 30% to make the \nProject economically nonviable. A reduction in the generated production by 20% and a 1-year \ndelay in completion do not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of costs \nand benefits were also tested. The result showed that the Project would maintain its economic \nviability under those scenarios. \n \n8.  The economic analysis of the Project was extended to quantify the project risk and \ndistribute project net benefits among various stakeholders. The risk analysis was based on the \n\u201cMonte Carlo\u201d method by considering the possible value for key variables, including capital \ncosts, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, freight traffic, and net economic \nvalue of generated production, as well as the probability with which they may occur. The result \nshows that the EIRR would exceed 12% with 95% probability. Distribution analysis was carried \nout  by  distributing  project  net  benefits  through  determining  the  project  effects  for  project \nbeneficiaries, such as shippers, passengers, labor, and government/local economy. The result \nshows  that  a  large  proportion  (CNY5.261 million)  of  net  benefits  will  accrue  to  the \ngovernment/local economy through generated production of commodities.  \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nTable A13.1: Traffic Forecast \n \n      2010 2015 2020 2025\nFreight (million)         \n   Ton             5.4              7.2              9.8            12.2 \n   Ton-kms         640.0          872.7        1,168.8        1,456.6 \n     \n   By commodity (ton-kms)   \nCoal           14.9            20.0            26.5            32.2 \n  Petroleum Products           27.3            37.0            53.6            71.4 \n  Steel and nonferrous metal             5.1              0.7              3.3            13.8 \n  Other alloys           28.4            38.4            51.2            62.9 \n  Zinc concentrate             5.1              0.7              3.3            13.8 \n  Metallic ore             2.1              2.7              3.6              4.5 \n  Iron Ore             2.1              2.7              3.6              4.5 \n  Lead             8.5            10.7            14.4            17.8 \n  Manganese           10.4            13.1            17.6            21.8 \n  Zinc ore           25.5            32.1            43.2            53.5 \n  Nonmetallic ore           21.0            12.6            19.6            27.9 \n  Building material           23.1            36.1            48.3            59.4 \n  Cement         297.7          430.6          558.0           665.4 \n  Timber           16.4            21.9            30.7            39.6 \n  Chemicals           23.7            26.6            34.8            42.1 \n  Fertilizers             6.0            11.0            15.9            21.4 \n  Foodstuff           22.2            26.0            36.4            46.8 \n  Other         100.2          149.8          204.8           257.8 \n     \nPassenger (million)   \nNumber             3.1              4.4              6.2              8.5 \n   of which tourists             2.4              3.3              4.7              6.4 \nPassenger-kms         448.4          637.8          900.4        1,233.6 \nkm = kilometers \nSources: Technical assistance consultants; Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nTable A13.2: Distribution of Project Benefits \n(present values at 12%, CNY million)  \n \nFinancial  Economic  Government / \nPresent  Present  Local \nItem  Value  Value  Difference Shippers  Passengers  Labor  Economy \nBenefits               \n  Freight Revenue  1,576   (1,576) (1,576)  \n  Passenger Revenue  1,353   (1,353) (1,353)  \n  Benefits from:     \n     Freight Traffic  1,877  1,877 1,877  \n     Benefits from     \n     Passenger Traffic  1,009  1,009 1,009  \n     Generated Production  5,074  5,074   5,074\n     Tourism Benefits  448  448   448\n  Total Benefits  2,929 8,408  5,479  \nCosts     \n  Capital and O&M  3,202 3,682  (480)   (480)\n  Labor  489 328  161 161 \n  Tax  219   219   219\n  Total Costs  3,910 4,010  (100)  \n     \n  Net Benefits (981) 4,398  5,379 301 (344) 161  5,261\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSources: Technical assistance consultants; Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 13  47 \nTable A13.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(constant 2004 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million)\nCosts Benefits\nOperation and \nPassenger  Freight  Tourism  Net \nYear Capital Maintenance Total Traffic Traffic Benefits Total Benefit\n2004 16 16 (16)\n2005 598 598 (598)\n2006 1,091 1,091 (1,091)\n2007 1,290 1,290 (1,290)\n2008 692 692 (692)\n2009 0 118 118 82 298 36 416 298\n2010 0 166 166 87 710 39 836 670\n2011 0 171 171 94 750 42 885 715\n2012 0 176 176 100 793 45 938 762\n2013 0 181 181 108 837 48 993 812\n2014 77 187 264 116 885 51 1,051 788\n2015 97 192 289 124 935 55 1,114 825\n2016 0 198 198 133 987 59 1,179 982\n2017 0 204 204 143 1,043 63 1,249 1,045\n2018 0 210 210 153 1,102 68 1,323 1,113\n2019 0 216 216 164 1,164 73 1,402 1,185\n2020 13 223 235 175 1,208 78 1,461 1,225\n2021 0 229 229 186 1,253 83 1,523 1,293\n2022 0 236 236 199 1,301 88 1,587 1,351\n2023 0 243 243 211 1,349 94 1,655 1,411\n2024 151 251 402 225 1,400 100 1,725 1,324\n2025 0 258 258 240 1,453 106 1,799 1,541\n2026 0 266 266 255 1,508 113 1,876 1,610\n2027 0 274 274 272 1,564 121 1,957 1,683\n2028 (737) 282 (455) 290 1,623 129 2,042 2,497\nEconomic Net Present Value at 12% =    1 ,349\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return = 17.0%\nSources: Technical assistance consulltants; Asian Development Bank estimates.\nTable A13.4: Sensitivity Analysis\nEconomic Switching\nChange EIRR NPV Sensitivity Valueb\nScenario (%) (%) (CNY million) Indicatora (%)\n    Base Case 17.0 1,349\n1.

General \n1.  West Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), the implementing agency of the Dali\u2013Lijiang \nRailway (DLR), was established in August 2004, after expanding the scope of the existing \nGuangda Railway Corporation (GDRC), established in 1996 to operate the Guangtong\u2013Dali \n(Guangda) Railway line, which was open to traffic in 1999. The project railway, the DLR, will be \nconnected to the Guangda line to extend the railway network from Dali to Lijiang,  another \npopular tourist city in Yunnan. To maximize the operating efficiency, the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR) and Yunnan provincial government (YPG), the existing shareholders of WYRC, have \ndecided that the DLR will be operated by WYRC. MOR and YPG have committed to contribute \nthe required capital for the construction of the DLR. Table A14.1 presents GDRC\u2019s audited \nfinancial  performance  during  2001\u20132003  and  financial  projections  of  WYRC  covering  the \nconstruction period and 20 years of operations (2004\u20132028). The projections reflect the overall \noperating performance and financial status of GDRC and WYRC including both the Guangda \nand DLR lines in current terms. The domestic price escalation is assumed to be 2.7% per \nannum for 2005, and 3% thereafter and the international price escalation is estimated at zero \npercent per annum for 2005 and thereafter. \n \nB.  Major Assumptions for the Financial Projections \n2.  The  existing  average  tariff  rates  of  the  Guangda  line  are  used  for  projecting  the \nrevenues of both the Guangda and DLR lines. The tariffs, CNY0.25 per ton-km for freight and \nCNY0.27 per passenger-km1 in 2004, were increased every 5 years by 5% in nominal terms. \nDLR traffic growth rates follow the traffic analysis in Appendix 13. Freight traffic of the Guangda \nline is based on the projected freight volume of 8.1 million tons in 2010, 11.9 million tons in \n2015, and 29.3 million tons in 2025. Passenger traffic of the Guangda line is forecast based on \nthe operations of 7 pairs per day in 2010, 10 pairs per day in 2015, and 21 pairs per day in \n2025. This implies a traffic growth rate of 12% during the initial stage of operations and the rate \nwill gradually decline to 7% toward the end of the projection period. A business tax of 3.24% is \nimposed on gross revenue. The income tax is 33% on profit before tax.2 \n \n3.  Operating expenses are forecast to increase annually in line with domestic inflation and \nto increase by 10% in real terms every 5 years. Depreciation expenses are based on a 25-year \naverage economic asset life. Salaries and wages account for the major portion of general and \nadministrative expenses. Currently, WYRC employs 570 staff and plans to recruit an additional \n300 staff for the operations of the DLR. Financial expenses reflect the expected interest rates \nand outstanding borrowings. \n \n4.  WYRC will borrow $180 million from ADB and \u20ac33.5 million ($40 million equivalent) from \nthe Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to finance the Project. The ADB loan will be a \nLondon interbank offered rate-based loan with 25-year maturity including a 5-year grace period. \nAFD\u2019s loan will be a euro interbank offered rate (Euribor)-based loan with a 17-year maturity \nincluding a 5-year grace period. Capital injections from MOR and YPG in the ratio of 70:30 to \nfinance the Project are classified as paid-in capital.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Freight tariffs vary according to types of commodities transported while passenger tariffs are based on types of \nseats. The above rates reflect the freight and passenger tariffs on average.  \n2  GDRC was granted exemption from business tax during the financial years 2002\u20132005. \n ", "Appendix 14  49 \nC.  Financial Performance of the Project and Proposed Covenants  \n \n5.  The financial performance of WYRC is projected to be sound and sustainable over the \nlong term. Freight and passenger traffic on the Guangda line has increased substantially since \nthe beginning of operations. Continued increasing traffic, albeit at slower growth rates, will \ncontribute to higher net profits. However, these are projected to decline in 2010, the first year \nwhen the DLR is open to commercial traffic. This reflects the relatively low traffic volume and \nrevenues of the DLR during the initial stage of operation. Because it will take time for traffic to \ngrow, the increase in operating costs will initially be higher than the incremental revenues. The \nsubsequent increase in traffic on the DLR, together with improved operating efficiency as a \nresult of the combined operations of the Guangda and the DLR lines, will result in better \noperating performance and higher net profits.

Asian Development Bank estimates.", "    Appendix 14  51 \n \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \n1.  The financial evaluation of the Project covers the construction period during 2005\u20132008 \nand 20 years of operations during 2009\u20132028. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is \ncalculated in constant 2004 prices, after removing the potential impacts of inflation and foreign \ncurrency fluctuation and on an after-tax basis. Table A14.2 presents the FIRR calculation. The \nkey assumptions used in the evaluation are as follows: \n \n(i)  Capital  costs  consist  of  project  costs  excluding  costs  for  local  roads,  price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. The residual value is \nestimated based on an average economic life of assets of 25 years. \n \n(ii)  Revenues of the Project include (a) freight and passenger revenues of the DLR; \n(b) incremental  revenues  to  the  Guangda  line  as  a  result  of  additional  traffic \noriginated  from  or  destined  for  the  connecting  DLR;  and  (c) other  revenues \nincluding loading and unloading, warehouse storage, parcel transfer, and rental \nincome  from  commercial  areas  in  the  train  stations.  Freight  and  passenger \nrevenues are projected based on forecast freight and passenger traffic and tariffs. \nFreight and passenger tariffs are CNY0.25 per ton-km and CNY0.27 per passenger-\nkm, respectively. Other revenues are estimated at 12% of total revenues. GDRC will \nbe subject to business tax of 3.24% that is to be deducted from gross revenues and \nincome tax of 33% on profits before tax. \n \n(iii)  Operating costs include all incremental costs incurred by the operations but exclude \ndepreciation  provisions.  Based  on  the  operational  experience  of  GDRC,  the \noperating costs were estimated as follows: fixed cost (including provision for major \nrepair and maintenance) CNY447,000 per line-km, freight variable cost of CNY0.07 \nper ton-km, and passenger variable cost of CNY0.03 per passenger-km. \n \n2.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was \ncalculated based on the capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision of ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for \nADB debt, (ii) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate is used for AFD debt, and (iii) the cost of \nequity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of income \ntax of 33%. The nominal cost of debt  is converted to the real cost of debt by applying the \ndomestic and international inflation rate for domestic and foreign currency denominated debt, \nrespectively.  \n \n3.  The Project FIRR is estimated to be 6.7%, which is higher than the WACC of 4.5% The \nfinancial viability of the Project is thus considered satisfactory. The FIRR was subjected to \nsensitivity analysis under various adverse conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that the \nFIRR would decrease to (i) 5.6% if the revenues were to decrease by 10%; (ii) 5.7% if the \nProject was to experience a capital cost overrun of 10%; (iii) 6.4% if the operating costs were to \nincrease by 10%; (iv) 6.0% if the Project was to experience a commissioning delay of 1 year; \n(v) 4.6% if scenarios (i)\u2013(iii) happen; and (vi) 4.0% if scenarios (i)\u2013(iv) all happen. The Project is \nthus  considered  financially  viable  under  almost  all  adverse  scenarios.

The project railway alignment will cross 56 villages in  13 townships from Dali  city to \nLijiang city in Yunnan province. An estimated 5,913 mu (394 hectares [ha]) of land will be \npermanently acquired, of which about 70.3%  is currently under cultivation. The number of \naffected people will be about 4,159, assuming total loss of cultivated land based on average per \ncapita landholdings. The Project will also temporarily require an estimated 1,600 mu (106.7 ha), \naffecting 250 people. About 179,804 square meters (m2) of mainly residential structures will be \naffected, requiring relocation of 680 households (3,150 people). The relocation of one school \nand a brick-kiln will require 594 m2 and affect an additional 150 people. The total number of \npeople directly affected is estimated at 7,709. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were \nminimized by aligning the railway away from densely populated areas, and avoiding irrigated \nland and facilities, where possible, based on consultations with communities. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR), Western Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), and local \ngovernments  prepared  the  resettlement  plan,  with  the  assistance  of  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) consultants and Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJU). It is based \non the first stage of a preliminary design study, 20 village surveys, 218 household surveys, local \ngovernment  statistics,  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected \nhouseholds. The resettlement plan will be revised based on the detailed measurement survey, \nincluding associated cost changes. The revised resettlement plan will be disclosed to affected \npeople, and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for concurrence prior to the start \nof civil works. \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to ensure that compensation and entitlement provided to \naffected people are adequate to at least maintain their \u201cwithout-project\u201d standard of living, with \nprospects of improvement, in line with the Land Administration Law (1998) of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (1995), and policy \non indigenous peoples (1998). People losing land, housing, other assets, or other means of \nproduction will be compensated at replacement cost and assisted in restoring their incomes and \nliving standards. In 2004, the PRC Constitution was amended to ensure that people are \ncompensated according to law for land expropriated for public projects. \n \n4.  The resettlement plan stipulates eligibility/entitlement provisions for affected people. \nPermanent land losses will be compensated either through land reallocation within villager \ngroups or through cash payments at rates of 8\u201310 times the average annual output value \n(AAOV) of the land. A resettlement subsidy is calculated at 4\u20136 times AAOV. Compensation for \ntemporary land loss will be paid directly to the affected people and the land will be restored to \nfarmland after use. Compensation for housing losses will be paid directly to the affected people \nat replacement cost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials; these households will \nrebuild their own houses within the same village. Crop and tree losses will be directly paid to the \naffected people. Private shops will be paid compensation for relocation and reconstruction. \n \n5.  Out of 56 affected  villages, five are seriously affected. However, none of the farming \nhouseholds will incur complete land loss. Also, income loss is thus less severe because planted \ncrops typically account for less than 30% of the household\u2019s gross income. Special assistance is \nprovided to vulnerable households that include orphans, widows, the seriously disabled, and the \nmentally ill. Ethnic minorities account for 83% of the affected people, including Bai, Lisu, and \nNaxi villages. Special measures have been included in the resettlement plan and the EMDP to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies  and  guidelines  and  to  enhance \nopportunities for affected people to directly benefit from the Project. \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \n \n6.  Each village will utilize the land compensation and resettlement subsidy for income \nrestoration. Each village or group will decide the amount of funds to be invested collectively and \nthe amount to be provided directly to affected households. Income restoration measures include \n(i) land redistribution within affected groups, (ii) collective investments in land development and \nenterprises,  (iii) individual  investments  in  farm  and  nonfarm  business,  (iv) setting  up \ninsurance/pension funds for the elderly, (v) provision of job training, and (vi) employment in \nproject-related activities during construction. \n \n7.  MOR, WYRC, and local government, including  the prefecture- and county-level land \nacquisition and  resettlement offices and land administration bureaus, will be responsible for \nimplementing and delegating resettlement activities to township officials and village committees. \nThe estimated resettlement cost is CNY141 million ($17.1 million), including contingencies. \nAgreement on the total resettlement budget was reached on 21 July 2004 between MOR and \nYPG. The resettlement budget will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical \nlosses. Dali prefecture and Lijiang city governments will finance costs for livelihood training \n(e.g., agricultural and nonagricultural training), and additional support for vulnerable groups. \n \n8.  Affected people were informed and consulted about the likely impacts of the project at \nvarious stages. Stakeholders consulted include heads of affected households, village heads and \nrepresentatives, local government agencies and departments, and vulnerable groups, including \nwomen and ethnic minorities. A resettlement information booklet was distributed to villages, \ngroups, and households affected by land loss and/or relocation. The resettlement information \nbooklet contains project description and impact, compensation policy, compensation standards, \nparticipation, and grievance procedures.  Affected households will also be consulted and can \nparticipate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey, location of \nunderpasses, new housing sites, collective investment of compensation, and grievance redress. \n \n9.  WYRC,  with  the  prefecture-level  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  offices,  in \ncollaboration with the county resettlement offices, will be responsible for internal supervision \nand monitoring. The following activities will be monitored: (i) compensation payments, (ii) house \nrebuilding/relocation  for  affected  people,  (iii) land  redistribution,  and  (iv) grievance  redress. \nProgress reports will be prepared by WYRC and submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis, until \nresettlement  is  completed.  WYRC  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for \nsubmission to MOR and ADB. In addition, an independent monitor will be contracted by WYRC \nto carry out the external monitoring and evaluation work. The tasks include: (i) baseline survey, \n(ii) review and verification of the compensation payments, (iii) status of land acquisition and \ncompensation payments, (iv) appraisal of grievance redress procedures, (v) affected people\u2019s \nreaction/satisfaction with entitlements and compensation, (vi) assessment of the restoration of \nlivelihoods of affected people, and (vii) drawing lessons learned for future resettlement planning. \nThe external monitor will prepare monitoring and evaluation reports for submission to MOR and \nADB every 6 months until the completion of resettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation \ninvestigations will be conducted for at least 2 years and reported to WYRC and ADB. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  55 \nTable A15: Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n(as of 25 August 2004)  \n  \n      Responsible  Completion   \nNo.  Resettlement Tasks  Target  Agency  Date  Status \n1.

An ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) was prepared to  (i) ensure equitable \nsharing of project benefits, (ii) address adverse affects of the project on ethnic minorities,1 and \n(iii) increase participation of ethnic minorities in project implementation and operation. The \nEMDP includes specific actions for affected ethnic minorities to ensure compliance with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) policy on  indigenous peoples. Measures to enhance the \neconomic conditions of ethnic minorities have either been integrated into project design or \nspecified separately in the EMDP. \n \n2.  The Project will directly benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area, of whom 73% \nare ethnic minorities including Bai (46.2%), Naxi (18.3%), Yi (3.2%), and Lisu (2.8%). The new \nrail network will enable ethnic minority families to use improved transportation services, have \nbetter access to social services (e.g., government, cultural, health, and education services), and \nemployment opportunities, both from construction and induced economic development.  The \nrailway line will traverse  Dali county-level city and  Heqing county in  Dali Bai Autonomous \nPrefecture, and Lijiang county in Lijiang prefecture. Along the proposed alignment, 83% of the \nresettlement-affected populations are ethnic minorities. The Project will have a direct adverse \nimpact on these ethnic groups in terms of land acquisition and resettlement, which will affect \nabout 7,709 people. Special measures are included in the resettlement plan to mitigate potential \nrisks such as impoverishment and social exclusion. In addition to the Han (16.8%), ethnic \ngroups affected by resettlement include the Bai (74.3%), and some Naxi (6.2%), Yi (1.5%), and \nLisu (0.4%) people. Detailed provisions to address land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nare included in the resettlement plan (e.g., compensation for land loss). \n \n3.  A social due diligence investigation was carried out to assess potential induced impacts \nof the Project in seven counties neighboring the project area, which is referred to as the \nboundaries of analysis (BOA). In the BOA, ethnic groups include: the Zang (Tibetans), Yi and \nNaxi in Xianggelila county; Yi, Naxi, Mosuo, and Pumi in Ninglang; Bai, Lisu, and Pumi in \nLanping county; Yi and Lisu in Yongsheng county; Lisu and Zang in Weixi county; and the Bai in \nEryuan and Jianchuan counties. The mainstream Han constitute 70% of the population in \nYongsheng county, and between 15% and 30% in Eryuan, Ninglang, Weixi, and Xianggelila, \nand less than 10% in Jianchuan and Lanping counties. The results of this assessment indicated \nstrong support for railway development as well as concerns that economic growth was changing \nlocal behavior. Although tourism development had some adverse effects,2 in general it was \npositive for cultural preservation, such as the reconstruction of monasteries financed by tourism \nrevenues. \n \n4.  The Government adopted a policy of ethnic equality post-1949 so all groups are legally \nand constitutionally equal. Local governments of autonomous areas have been able to decide \non  economic  policy,  including  what  to  produce,  some  latitude  in  allocating  government \nsubsidies, and within set guidelines, education and budgeting based on the Law on Ethnic \nRegional Autonomy (1984).  Recent government policies and programs have further helped \nprotect and enhance living standards of ethnic minority groups. \n \n5.  The Project directly benefits ethnic minorities in terms of higher income from increased \ncash-crop farming, more cash income sources due to seasonal migration work and tourism \nopportunities, enhanced communication with urban centers, and better access to markets and \nsocial services. Construction access roads will improve transport services, and will be handed \n                                                 \n1  Ethnic minority groups are distinct from the mainstream ethnic group, the Han. The PRC policy defines \nnationalities (minzu) based on shared language, territory, economic base, and traditions/culture. \n2  The Mosuo group\u2014a matriarchal society located in Lugu Lake in Ninglang county (BOA) has come under \npressure from excessive tourism development. The ethnic affairs bureau and tourism bureau are taking measures \nto avoid negative influences and to enhance cultural preservation as the basis for tourism. \n ", "Appendix 17  59 \n \nover to the community after completion of railway construction. In addition, the Project will have \nthe  following  socioeconomic  benefits:  (i) reduced  travel  times  between  Dali  and  Lijiang; \n(ii) increased affordable, safe, and comfortable transport for passengers traveling between Dali \nand Lijiang; (iii) removal of constraints to economic growth, especially cargo transportation in \nthe project area; and (iv) increased short-term construction jobs in townships crossed by the \nrailway.  \n \n6.  Specific activities are incorporated into the EMDP to ensure that ethnic minorities share \nproportionately in project benefits and adverse impacts are properly mitigated (Table A17). The \nProject and the EMDP will benefit women who are very active in the workforce when economic \nopportunities are available, especially tourism. Women expressed interest in launching small \nbusinesses next to the proposed railway stations. However, women often lack education and \nartisan skills; therefore, job training programs will be targeted at the affected villages, and \nwomen in particular. The incidence of reported HIV/AIDS infection is not high in the project area, \nhowever ethnic minority groups residing in the project area could be more vulnerable to the \nspread of infection given their numbers, language, culture, geographic location, and low levels \nof HIV/AIDS knowledge and awareness. For this reason, special measures are included in the \nproject for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. Ecological and culturally sustainable tourism \nalso needs to be implemented; tourism strategies have already been adopted in Yunnan and \nthis year a tourism plan has been formulated for northwestern  Yunnan. The induced social \nimpacts  of  economic  development,  including  tourism,  will  be  monitored  during  project \nconstruction to ensure that preservation measures of ethnic minority cultures are effective. \n \n7.  The Western Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC) is responsible for implementing the \nEMDP and will work closely with local governments, including the ethnic affairs bureaus. Most of \nthe budget for the EMDP is included in the civil works cost (e.g., station area development), the \nresettlement plan budget, and local employment on project-related activities. Part of the budget \nfor nonagricultural training and HIV/AIDS awareness will come from existing local government \nprograms. ADB will also provide a $150,000 grant as technical assistance for (i) capacity \nbuilding and skill enhancement programs for the poor and ethnic minorities; (ii) feasibility studies \nfor cultural protection and preservation; and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of measures being \ntaken  to  preserve  local  cultures,  particularly  with  respect  to  project-induced  tourism \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  WYRC is responsible for ni ternal monitoring of the EMDP and will submit progress \nreports to ADB semiannually. An independent monitor will conduct external monitoring and \nevaluation,  and  reports  will  be  submitted  to  WYRC  and  ADB  annually.  Results  will  be \ndisaggregated by ethnic minority group and sex, wherever possible. The ADB midterm review \nwill assess the status and effectiveness of EMDP implementation; if needed, steps to better \nprotect or publicize ethnic culture will be further discussed with MOR. \n \n ", "60       Appendix 17 \nTable A17: Summary Ethnic Minority Action Plan  \nLead/Supporting  Funding \nProposed Actions  Targets*  Timing  Monitoring Indicators \nAgencies Involved  Requirements \n1.

No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nBetter railway transport contributes to poverty reduction directly through improved  access to markets, increased \nemployment opportunities during construction and operation, and affordable access to the outside; and indirectly \nthrough induced economic development and job creation. Improved access to markets reduces transport costs, and \nopens up opportunities for locally produced goods and services. Construction and operation of the railway generates \nadditional employment opportunities in local communities, providing an additional source of income for people, \nincluding poor households along the alignment and in the wider project area. Incoming passengers and tourists \ngenerate additional demand for locally produced goods and services. Secondary development associated with railway \nconstruction includes construction of access roads and the upgrading and extension of connector roads from the \nstation to the main road network. These roads help extend project benefits and opportunities to the rural poor \ncommunities by improving local infrastructure, reducing transport costs, increasing access to markets, stimulating \nprice competition, and improving conditions for economic growth, including tourism. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe links between poverty, minority nationality, topography, and transport systems are apparent in the project area for \nthe Dali\u2013Lijiang Railway. The Project will benefit about 1.1 million people in the project area. The proposed railway \ntransverses across 13 townships, directly affecting Dali county-level city and Heqing county in Dali Bai Autonomous \nPrefecture, and Lijiang county. Out of 1.1 million beneficiaries, about 75% are rural with an average rural net income \nper capita of CNY2,202 in 2002, and about 30% are poor with an average net income per capita of less than CNY900. \nA total of 372 key poverty reduction villages are located in the project area, out of which 27 villages are located in the \nproject railway corridor townships. About 73% of the people in the project area are ethnic minorities (e.g., Bai, Naxi, \nand Yi). The boundaries of analysis (BOA) includes neighboring counties that could be affected from induced impacts \nfrom the proposed Project, based on the existing and planned transportation networks. The BOA includes: Eryuan and \nJianchuan counties in Dali Bai prefecture, Ninglang and Yongsheng counties in Lijiang prefecture, Weixi and \nXianggelila (Zhongdian) counties in Diqing prefecture and Lanping county in Nujiang prefecture. About 91% of the \npopulation is rural with a poverty incidence of more than 60% and an average net income per capita of CNY1,128 in \n2002. The Project considered these counties within BOA as part of its due diligence of the potential adverse impacts \non local ethnic populations.  \n \nThe Project will benefit poor people in the project area through direct benefits from employment during the \nconstruction and operation of the railway. It is estimated that 96,800 person-years of work spread over 3.5 years will \nbe needed to construct the railway, or about 27,670 person-years of work per year. Of these, 60% will be for unskilled \nlaborers, of which 50% or more will be targeted to poor ethnic minority households. Priority will be given to women and \npeople from resettlement-affected households. Employment will be created through the use of locally produced \nmaterials for railway construction (e.g., cement). The Project will finance 251 kilometers (km) of construction access \nroads, which will be handed over to the local government at the end of the construction period. The construction of \npassenger stations, using architecture unique to the ethnic minority of the area, will cater to the information needs of \npassengers and tourists. There will be sufficient space in or around the stations for local area development. Kiosks or \nconcession stalls will be incorporated into the design of these intermediate stations. Local governments will be \nencouraged to convert additional space around the railway stations for commercial businesses. This will have \nimmediate benefits for the local poor population. \n \nThe Project will also provide efficient and low-cost transportation for passengers and goods, which will improve access \nto markets, and help the development of natural resources and industry in the area. Local government will prioritize a \nnumber of rural roads for upgrading to provide better access of economic opportunities that the railway will generate \nfor remote communities. These improvements will help generate additional opportunities for the poor population in the \nBOA through indirect project benefits, which will increase in the long run. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 18  63 \nC.

The Ministry of \nRailways (MOR), West Yunnan Railway Company (WYRC), and Second Survey and Design Institute (SSDI) have had \nformal and informal consultations with local communities and relevant local government agencies through meetings, \nsurveys, household interviews, written communications, and workshops, etc. (Appendix 16). Issues discussed \nincluded the selection of the line route, the outlet design for wastewater discharge, selection of water source, \narrangement of borrow pits and spoil disposal sitting, and sand and stone supply. A change in the location of Lijiang \nstation is an example of public influence on the project design. Further public consultation occurred during various field \nsurveys. Surveys were carried out among local residents, other stakeholders, and visiting tourists. Over 75 village \nsurveys and 800 households surveys were conducted for the environmental impact assessment (EIA), poverty and \nsocial assessment, ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP), and resettlement plan. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) commissioned two supplementary studies to further assess the induced development impacts of the Project on \nthe environment and vulnerable ethnic minority groups. Disclosure procedures have been followed for all plans. MOR \nand ADB also held a consultation workshop in Dali city to review the technical aspects of the Project, the draft final \nresettlement plan, EMDP, and summary EIA with provincial and local governments, county-level offices, relevant line \nagencies, Yunnan-based nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and locally affected people. Participants from Dali, \nHeqing, Lijiang, and Kunming attended the workshop, and voiced support for the Project based on the benefits \nbrought by economic, tourism, and natural resource development. Discussions were held on induced development \nimpacts, land acquisition, and resettlement impacts and compensation standards, migrant population impacts due to \ntourism, and the EMDP action plan. \n \nThe participation of local people will be central for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local \ngroups and relevant government agencies continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, \nespecially during the implementation of the EIA, resettlement plan, and EMDP. Railway support offices exist in each \nproject county, and will have copies of all relevant documents. During construction and operation, they will serve as \nkey coordinating points to enhance stakeholder participation.  Relevant line agencies will also help support the \nimplementation of the EIA, resettlement plan, and EMDP. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nDuring project preparation, analyses of sex-disaggregated data and discussions with representatives of the All-China \nWomen\u2019s Federation indicate that women are considered vulnerable. Data collected for the poverty and social \nassessment, the EMDP, and the resettlement plan indicate the following: (i) women constitute 46% of the total \npopulation in the project area; (ii) women primarily engage in agricultural activities; (iii) the female labor participation \nrate is high\u2014approximately 48%; and (iv) male members from poor households tend to travel further for migrant labor \nopportunities  than  nonpoor  males,  leaving  behind  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women.  A \nrepresentative from Lijiang Women\u2019s Federation supported the Project for the additional opportunities it would bring to \nwomen. For instance, the construction of the railway would create opportunities for local area development by \n(i) facilitating flow of materials and information into the area, and (ii) accelerating development of local industry\u2014\nprimarily agricultural and tourism.  \n \nPoverty and social enhancement measures have been built into the project design, and special mitigation (or \nprotection) actions have been included into the resettlement plan and the EMDP. For example, members of the \ncommunity will collectively decide where schools will be relocated. Women, especially female heads of household, will \nbe consulted as schools provide an informal source of daycare for their children. Widows will be eligible for special \nassistance, if necessary, during land acquisition and resettlement. Women will be given priority for project-generated \nemployment during construction and operation of the railway, including afforestation activities. The rise in female \nparticipation in the labor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, thus improving overall family \nwelfare, and increasing the status of women. There is potential for adverse impacts on the Mosuo minorities\u2014a \nmatriarchal society located in the BOA (Lugu lake in Ninglang) caused by excessive tourism development. However, \nthe local government and the Mosuo communities are already taking action to preserve their culture and tradition. This \nsensitive situation will be monitored during project construction to ensure actions are effective; otherwise, further \nmeasures would be required before the Project is completed.  \nHas an output been prepared?
