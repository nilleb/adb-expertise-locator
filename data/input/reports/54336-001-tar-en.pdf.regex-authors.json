The  proposed  project  is  a  financial intermediation loan for  a  line  of credit  of  up  to \n$150 million from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the \nGovernment of Bangladesh. The fund will be relent to Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, for \nonlending to participating financial institutions (PFIs). The PFIs will onlend the funds to micro and \nsmall  enterprises  started  or  operated  by  targeted  vulnerable  groups\u2014unemployed  youth, \nreturning migrant workers, and rural entrepreneurs\u2014with a focus on women entrepreneurs. The \nattached  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  totaling  $900,000  will  help  strengthen  the \ninstitutional capacity of Bangladesh Bank and PFIs and will support the project implementation. \nThe project is included in ADB\u2019s Bangladesh country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.1 The \nproject\u2019s impact is rapid recovery from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to restore \nemployment, income, and economic activities.2 The project will have the following outcome: \nadverse economic effects of COVID-19 on migrants, youth, and rural entrepreneurs mitigated. \nThe project\u2019s outputs are (i) financial support to enterprises started or operated by migrants, rural \nenterprises, and youth from the formal banking sector increased; (ii) capacity of employment-\nsupporting institutions strengthened; and (iii) action plan for promoting formal banking sector \nsupport for cottage, micro, and small enterprises (CMSEs) developed.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.   Despite the economic progress made, the country still faces challenges in providing jobs \nfor its growing population. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have \nexacerbated the employment problem. Millions of jobs are under threat, especially in the export, \ntourism, and service industries. With the absence of any large-scale unemployment protection \nschemes, people who are unemployed will fall into poverty. Workers in the informal sector are \nparticularly exposed, as the sector bears the brunt of the shutdown measures. While the impact \nof the pandemic is broad and deep, a few vulnerable groups\u2014particularly youth, women, and \nreturning migrants\u2014have emerged as severely affected and are among the worst prepared. \n \n3.  Recognizing this issue, the government has requested $150 million from ADB to establish \nthe post-COVID-19 small-scale employment creation fund, which will facilitate access to finance \nfor unemployed or underemployed youth, returning migrants, and entrepreneurs in the rural areas. \nThis fund will be administered by Bangladesh Bank and channeled through PFIs, with a special \nfocus on PFIs that have special targeted programs for youth, returnee migrants, and rural \nenterprises. \n \n4.   Supporting CMSEs is one of the most direct, effective, and sustainable approaches to \nretaining and creating employment. But it also poses significant challenges for the banking sectors \nin areas of risk management, business processes, and corporate strategy. Capacity development \nand implementation of best practices are needed to enable the banks to effectively reach out and \nfinance these marginal borrowers on a sustainable basis. The targeted groups also require \nadditional supports beyond just financing, in areas of training for technical knowhows and financial \nliteracy as well as business development support. Furthermore, to develop an overall enabling \nenvironment to improve financing inclusion of these marginal groups, a sector-wide action plan \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Dhaka. \n \n ", "2 \nwill be necessary to tackle some of the long-standing challenges such high operational costs and \nlack of risk mitigations.  \n \n5.  The attached TA of $900,000 will help Bangladesh Bank to strengthen the banking \nindustry\u2019s support for employment creation through (i) developing a strategy to guide the banking \nindustry to increase lending in the targeted segment, which may include credit enhancement \nmeasures, modernizing loan monitoring processes and systems, fintech, and other best practices \naimed at improving operational efficiency and managing credit risks; and (ii) conducting outreach \nand training for the beneficiaries (especially women and returning migrants), with a focus on \nfinancial literacy and business development. The TA will also aim to strengthen PFIs and potential \nPFIs  that  are  important  for  supporting  employment  creation,  through  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment and the promotion of best practices in CMSE banking.  \n \nB.
