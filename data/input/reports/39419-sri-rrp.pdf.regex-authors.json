Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n   \nProject Description  The Project has three investment components: energy efficiency \nimprovement, renewable energy development, and access for the \npoor.  \n \nThe  energy  efficiency  improvement  component  will  include \n(i) system control modernization (part 1); (ii) transmission system \nstrengthening (part 2); (iii) distribution substations augmentation \n(part  3);  (iv)  demand-side  management  for  municipal  street \nlighting (part 4); and (v) consulting services for system control \nmodernization (part 5).  \n \nThe  clean  energy  development  component  will  be  network \ncapacity augmentation for renewable energy projects (part 6).  \n \nThe access for the poor component will include (i) transmission \nsystem strengthening in the Eastern Province (part 7) and (ii) rural \nhousehold connection (part 8).  \n   \nRationale  Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector struggled throughout the late 1980s, \n1990s,  and  early  2000s  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for \nelectricity.  Electricity  is  expensive  and  subject  to  interruptions. \nAbout 20% of households do not have access to it. The Ceylon \nElectricity Board is burdened with debt, restricting its ability to \nmake capital investments and discouraging private investment. \nThe Government is fully committed to addressing these issues \nand has developed a Ten-Year Development Framework (TYDF). \nUnder  the  TYDF,  the  Government  has  developed  a  national \nenergy  policy  and  strategies  (NEPS).  The  NEPS  provides  a \ncomprehensive road map for the sector. It includes a long-term \ninvestment program and specific policy and reform measures and \naims to (i) supply electricity to 86% of households by 2010 and \n98% by 2016, and (ii) ensure electricity tariffs are competitive with \nthose in other countries and sufficient for utilities to be viable. \n \n \n  Under the NEPS, the Government is accelerating its long-term \ngeneration  expansion  plan  (LGEP)  to  build  up  generation \ncapacity, primarily with bilateral funding. At the same time, it is ", "ii   \ncontinuing its loss reduction efforts and launching a demand-side \nmanagement program to improve energy efficiency. Substantial \ninvestments  will  be  required  to  strengthen  the  transmission \nnetwork  and  for  power  plants.  The  huge  potential  for  energy \nconservation  through  demand-side  management  needs  to  be \nmore actively tapped. \n \nThe share of thermal  power in the power generation mix has \nincreased dramatically from 1% in 1986 to 58% in 2008 as the \nentire  demand  growth  has  been  served  by  oil-fired  thermal \ngeneration. This poses a serious threat to the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity  as  well  as  to  the  environment,  given  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \noverdependence on imported fossil fuels. Coupled with fuel price \nincreases and the delayed construction of new hydropower plants, \ngeneration costs have substantially increased. There is an urgent \nneed to develop clean energy and indigenous renewable energy \nsources.   \n \nTo achieve the electrification target under the TYDF, particular \nattention  needs  to  be  paid  to  regions  with  serious  power \nshortages and many unconnected households, including conflict-\naffected areas. The transmission system is currently too weak to \nmeet growing demand in the regions. Despite the Government\u2019s \nintensive  investment  program  to  expand  the  rural  distribution \nnetwork,  many  poor  households  remain  unconnected  even  in \nareas connected to the grid because they cannot afford the initial \ncost of service connection.  \n \nThe Project will support the Government to address these issues \nthrough  investment  loans  and  grant  and  associated  technical \nassistance.   \n \nThe Government has taken measures to strengthen governance \nand  rationalize  tariffs.  The  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  has  been \npassed by Parliament in March 2009. It will empower the Public \nUtilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to regulate the power \nsector.  To  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector,  the \nGovernment has restructured the debt of the Ceylon Electricity \nBoard (CEB) and raised tariffs by 30% in 2008 to reduce its cash \nshortfall  substantially.  The  Project  will  support  further \nstrengthening  of  the  governance  of  the  sector  through  its \nassociated  technical  assistance  for  capacity  development  of \nPUCSL and CEB.   \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  aims  to  realize  an  affordable  and  reliable  power \nsupply for sustained and inclusive economic growth by improving \nthe  coverage  and  service  efficiency  of  the  CEB  and  Lanka \nElectricity Company (LECO).   \n \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $188.2 million \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.8 million.

The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n16,843,000 ($25 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to finance parts 7 and 8, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n \nGrants of $4,200,000, including $2,000,000 from the Government \nof Japan (to be administered by ADB) and $2,200,000 from the \nClimate  Change  Fund,  will  be  provided  to  finance  part  4. \nAllocation of the grant to CEB and LECO will be decided by ADB \nduring project implementation, based on the project preparedness \nand progress of each agency. \n    \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make the loan proceeds available to CEB \nTerms  and  LECO  through  separate  subsidiary  financing  agreements \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  OCR  loan\u2014until  30  November  2013;  ADF  loan\u2014until  30 \nSeptember 2013.  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 May 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \n ", "iv   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Power and Energy \n   \nImplementing Agencies  CEB and LECO (part 3 (distribution substations augmentation) \nand part 4 (demand-side management) only). \n \nImplementation  The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the Executing \nArrangements  Agency of the Project. CEB will be the sole Implementing Agency \nfor  all  investment  parts  except  for  distribution  substations \naugmentation  (part  3)  and  demand-side  management  (part  4) \nparts which will be implemented jointly by CEB and LECO. Day-\nto-day  project  implementation  will  be  done  by  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be  set  up  in  CEB  and  LECO \nexclusively for the Project and headed by senior officers.   \n \nThe  distribution  substations  augmentation  part  will  be \nimplemented  initially  by  LECO,  and  subsequently  the  project \nassets and associated debt will be transferred to CEB, who will \nundertake operation and maintenance.  \n \nThe demand-side management part will be implemented by both \nCEB  and  LECO  in  their  respective  jurisdictions.  Once  MOPE \nissues a policy circular to delegate responsibility for municipal \nstreet lighting in selected areas from municipal authorities to CEB \nand LECO, they will establish internal energy service company \n(ESCO) units within which escrow accounts will be established to \naccumulate energy savings gains. The associated ADB technical \nassistance  will  help  them  to  do  this.  Upon  completion  of  the \npayback period, energy savings will create a revenue stream in \naddition to that generated through tariffs. It is envisioned that a \ncertain percentage of energy savings profits accumulated at the \nescrow  account  will  be  used  for  reinvestment  in  other  energy \nefficiency  projects  identified  by  the  ESCO  unit  as  part  of  its \noperational responsibilities.  \n \n  The rural household connection part will be implemented by CEB \nwith  the  support  of  service  providers  to  be  engaged  under  a \nperformance-based contract on terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB.  When a credit application is submitted to CEB from a \ncustomer  household,  a  service  provider  will  assess  the \nhousehold\u2019s  repayment  capacity,  while  CEB  will  confirm  the \ntechnical eligibility of electricity connection. If the application is \napproved,  CEB  will  provide  a  service  connection  and  the \nconnection cost will be recorded as a loan to the customer in \nCEB\u2019s balance sheet and recovered in installments over the next \n24\u201336  months.  An  escrow  account  will  be  set  up  in  CEB  to \nreceive  installment  payments.  Principal  and  interest  payments \nfrom  households  will  be  credited  to  the  account  and  used  to \nprovide  new  installment  credits.  ADB  will  provide  associated \ntechnical assistance for the detailed design of the part, selection \nof service providers, and capacity building of major stakeholders. \n ", "  v\nProcurement   Procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nloans will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement \npackages except for part 4 (the demand-side management) will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Shopping procedures will be used for the part 4 \nfor  the  procurement  of  standard  specification  goods  with \nestimated costs less than $0.1 million.  \n \n  CEB  and  LECO  have  requested  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing for procurement of goods up to 20% of the \ncumulative total of the OCR loan agreement and the ADF loan \nagreement for a period of up to 12 months prior to the signing of \neach  loan  agreement.  ADB  management  agreed  to  approve \nretroactive financing for all parts (except for part 4) upto 20% of \nthe proceeds from the loans, provided that expenditures are in \naccordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines  and  safeguard \npolicies,  and  were  incurred  during  the  12  months  before  the \nsigning of the respective loan agreements. CEB and LECO were \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  or  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n   \nConsulting Services  For the system control modernization part, loan-funded consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  under  part  5  to  support  CEB  in \nprocurement, construction supervision and also, on an intermittent \nbasis,  operation  and  maintenance  and  liability  issues  for  the \ndefect liability period (12 months after commissioning). CEB will \nselect  and  engage  consultants  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  procedures  at  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of \n80:20 and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using the full \ntechnical  proposal  method.  About  22  person-months  of \ninternational  and  3 person-months  of  national  consultants  are \nexpected to be required.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The energy efficiency improvement component will enhance the \nBeneficiaries  overall reliability of the power system to benefit households, small \nand medium-sized businesses, and public services, including, in \nparticular, schools and hospitals. It will bring power to industrial \ndistricts  where  existing  industries  currently  relying  on  captive \ngenerators  will  be  able  to  improve  their  productivity.  New \ninvestments will also be encouraged by the additional availability \nof power. In both cases, a sharp increase in labor demand is \nultimately  expected  to  benefit the local population. The demand- \nside management part is expected to save energy equivalent to a \nthermal  power  plant  of  3.5  MW.  The  renewable  energy \ndevelopment  component   will   help   bring  200   MW   of   clean \nhydropower energy into the grid, thereby reducing CO -equivalent \n2\nemissions per year by about 0.5 million tons. \n \n ", "vi   \n  The access for the poor component will contribute to social and \neconomic inclusion and the integration of the marginalized people, \nespecially in rural areas. Health, hygiene, and sanitation will be \nimproved. Children and adolescents will be able to spend more \nhours  studying.  The  component  will  improve  access  to \ninformation, awareness and knowledge. It will enhance mobility \nand security, particularly where people suffer from attacks by wild \nanimals while searching for food or where they are affected by the \nconflict.  Electrification will  enable poor  households  engaged  in \nhome-based  economic  activities  to  generate  more  household \nincome and to save time and physical labor by using electrical \nappliances. The rural household connection part will connect at \nleast 60,000 poor households (8% of the total) to the grid.  \n \n  The  access  for  the  poor  component  will  directly  benefit  the \nEastern  Province,  which  has  been  severely  affected  by  the \nconflict, and other poor regions. Such regions often suffer from \nharsh weather and natural disasters, and lack basic infrastructure, \nincluding  electricity  distribution.  Three  districts  in  the  Eastern \nProvince where the component will be implemented have mixed \nSinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim populations, and are therefore more \ncomplex than other parts of the country. The Project will directly \ncontribute to the development of the Eastern Province, but will \nalso benefit other regions that are lagging behind.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major assumptions are that (i) the Government will remain \ncommitted to power sector reforms; (ii) LGEP will be implemented \nin a timely manner; and (iii) the Sri Lanka Electricity Act will be \nefficiently implemented for PUCSL to regulate the sector. \n  \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to sector reform is demonstrated \nby  the  fact  that  it  has  (i)  provided  financial  support  for  the \nimplementation  of  CEB\u2019s  long-term  debt  restructuring  plan; \n(ii) submitted the NEPS for parliamentary approval, which is not \nrequired  for  a  policy  document,  and  gazetted  it;  and \n(iii) substantially increased retail tariffs to improve CEB\u2019s financial \nposition. CEB has drafted its first long-term corporate plan, which \nit  is  using  as  a  basis  for  its  internal  reform  exercise.  The \nGovernment has already secured financing for the priority projects \nin  LGEP  and  three  projects  totaling  950  MW  are  being \nimplemented. \n \nParliament has passed the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in March 2009 \nand PUCSL has started regulating the power sector. Although \nthere is a risk that PUCSL and CEB will lack the capacity to \noperate effectively under the new regulatory framework, this will \nbe  substantially  mitigated  by  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for \ncapacity  development  of  the  two  agencies  and  PUCSL\u2019s \nexperience in supporting the Government\u2019s policy-making over the \npast 4 years.    ", "  vii\n   \nOther  risks  to  the  implementation  of  the  investment  projects \ninclude (i) delays in associated generation investments, (ii) delays \nin project implementation and resulting project cost escalation, \nand (iii) a deterioration in the security situation in the Eastern \nProvince.  These  risks  also  appear  to  be  low.  A  policy  and \nregulatory  framework  is  already  in  place  to  streamline  the \nGovernment approval process for renewable energy projects. The \nSustainable Energy Authority (SEA) has been established as a \nfocal  agency  for  renewable  energy  development  and  is  being \nsupported by ADB TA to expedite the review of the pending small \nhydropower projects that will be promoted by the Project. All the \nsubprojects under the Project are ready for implementation and \nadvance procurement will help expedite project implementation \nand mitigate risk of cost overruns. As the Government is now \ntaking full control of Eastern Province, no difficulty is foreseen in \nimplementing  the  subprojects.  The  associated  technical \nassistance will also help to design implementation arrangements.   \n \nTechnical Assistance  TA  grants  will  be  provided  for  advisory  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  in  (i)  Capacity  Development  for  Power  Sector \nRegulation\u2014to provide capacity development support for PUCSL \nand  CEB  to  ensure  effective  regulation  of  the  sector  and  to \npromote  CEB\u2019s  internal  reforms  based  on  its  corporate  plan; \n(ii) Demand-Side  Management  of  Municipal  Street  Lighting\u2014to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  demand-side  management  part; \nand (iii) Rural Household Connection\u2014to support implementation \nof the rural household connection part. \n \n  The total cost of the TA projects is estimated at $4,750,000, of \nwhich ADB will finance $3,800,000 on a grant basis from its TA \nfunding  program  ($1,000,000),  the  Climate  Change  Fund \n($800,000), and the Japan Special Fund ($2,000,000). The TA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. ADB will engage qualified consulting \nfirms and individual consultants. \n ", " \nI.

A design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector struggled throughout the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s to \nmeet the growing demand for electricity. Given that demand for power is growing by about 8% \nper  year,  the  country  faces  a  serious  shortage  of  power  and  a  consequent  slowdown  of \neconomic growth unless generation capacity is significantly increased and the transmission and \ndistribution  network  is  strengthened.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  national  electrification  ratio 2  improved \nsignificantly from 10.9% in 1986 to 82% in 2008 and compares favorably with those in other \nSouth Asian countries. However, substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist. As of \nthe end of 2008, per capita electricity consumption was about 492 kilowatt-hours (kWh), lower \nthan in India and Pakistan. System losses are estimated at 15%. While this is relatively low \ncompared to the average of  South Asia, there is still room to reduce losses by another 4%\u20135%.  \n \n3.  In  Sri  Lanka,  the  total  power  generation  capacity  available  to  the  grid  was  \n2,580 megawatts (MW) at the end of 2008. Of the total energy provided to the grid, 37.4% is \nhydropower, 58.2% is thermal (oil), and 4.4% is nonconventional renewable energy. Ceylon \nElectricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) are the only two utilities in the \npower sector. CEB, an integrated utility fully owned by the Government and engaged in the \ngeneration, transmission and distribution of electricity, has an installed generation capacity of \n1,725 MW, serving about 90% of all customers. LECO was formed as a distribution company \nunder the Companies Act and most of its shares are owned by CEB and the Government. \nMunicipal authorities are minority shareholders. LECO purchases bulk power from CEB and \ndistributes it to about 400,000 consumers in other urban areas in the western and coastal belt, \nrepresenting about 10% of all consumers. The private sector is currently only in the generation \nsector and has a total capacity of 705 MW. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems \n \n4.  In  Sri  Lanka,  electricity  is  expensive  and  subject  to  interruptions.  About  20%  of \nhouseholds do not have access to it. CEB is burdened by debt, restricting its capacity to make \ncapital investments and discouraging private investment.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n2 The ratio of electrified households to total households.  ", "2   \n5.  High Cost of Generation. The share of thermal power in the power generation mix has \nincreased dramatically from 1% in 1986 to 58% in 2008 as the entire growth in demand has \nbeen served by oil-fired thermal generation. The 1998 policy of building thermal power plants \nwith private financing has resulted in a proliferation of relatively small high-cost oil-fired plants. \nPolitical decisions and lack of financial resources have prevented CEB from implementing the \nleast-cost generation plan, which is to use coal as it is the most economic source of energy. The \nmove toward oil-fired plants, the increase in the oil price, and the delayed construction of new \nhydropower plants have significantly pushed up the cost of generation. There is an urgent need \nto build up base-load generation capacity with low-cost fuels such as imported coal and to \ninvest in hydropower and other renewable resources. \n \n6.   Skewed Tariff Structure. The dramatic increase in generation costs since 1998 has \nnot been passed on to electricity consumers since the Government, as the regulator, has had \nneither the political will to pass on the cost increases to consumers nor the technical capacity to \nevaluate the CEB\u2019s cost structure to decide on the appropriate level of tariffs. As a result, CEB \nhas posted an operating loss since 2000 and accumulated its liability. Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity \ncustomers, particularly commercial and industrial customers and large households, pay higher \nprices than most of their regional comparators. A reduction in the cost of supply is urgently \nneeded, coupled with a stable and high-quality supply of electricity. \n \n7.  Inadequate and Aging Transmission and Distribution Network. Retail tariffs, which \ndo not reflect the cost of supply, coupled with delays in project implementation, have continued \nto squeeze its investments in transmission and distribution. The low-voltage distribution network \nrequires improvements if it is to meet the expansion in housing and commercial developments. \nOverdue investment in the medium-voltage distribution network has caused overloading, poor \nreliability and fluctuating voltage at many locations. The growth in demand for power distributed \nover the medium-voltage network requires a matching investment in the transmission network \nand grid substations. Immediate investments in the transmission and distribution network are \nneeded, not only to reduce system losses and to ensure the stability of the entire power system, \nbut also to encourage private sector investment in nonconventional renewable energy.   \n   \n8.  High Commercial Losses and Lack of Penetration in Rural Areas. The low customer \ndensity in suburban and rural areas causes higher network losses than in urban areas. In \nparallel with network strengthening, further efforts are needed to upgrade and improve meters \nand  metering  systems  and  to  enforce  strict  surveillance  to  prevent  theft.  Another  major \nchallenge in rural areas is low penetration in electrified villages. Even in neighborhoods already \nreached by distribution feeders, many households remain unconnected as they cannot afford to \npay connection charges.   \n   \n2.  Government Policy and Planning Framework \n \n9.  The  Government\u2019s  Ten-Year  Development  Framework  (TYDF)  prepared  in  2006 \nenvisions  \u201csustainable  development  of  energy  resources,  conversion  facilities  and  delivery \nsystems to enable access to and use of energy services by the entire population, and the safe, \nreliable delivery of such energy services at a regionally competitive price, through commercially \nviable institution subjected independent regulation.\u201d3 To underpin the TYDF, the Government \ndeveloped  the  national  energy  policy  and  strategies  (NEPS),  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  road  map,  including  a  long-term  investment  program  and  policy  and  reform \nmeasures. It aims to (i) supply electricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and \n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

The Government gazetted the NEPS in June 2008.  \n \n3.  Sector Road Map \n \n10.  Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LGEP). In the short term, generation costs \nare expected to continue to increase, reflecting oil prices and the commissioning of the oil-fired \nKerawalapitiya Thermal Power Station (300 MW). In the medium term, the Government aims to \nreverse this trend by adding three coal-fired plants, one hydropower plant, and an additional 500 \nMW of renewable energy. The Government has imposed a moratorium on oil-burning power \nplants  until  non-oil  sources  provide  90%  of  the  grid  energy.  The  Government  is  actively \npromoting private sector investment in coal-fired thermal power, medium-scale conventional \nhydropower, and renewable energy projects. Planned generation capacity addition under the \nLGEP is provided in Table 1.   \n \nTable 1: Generation Capacity Addition Plan \n(MW) \nItem  FY2008  FY2012  FY2016 \nSupply       \nThermal (Oil)        1,222        1,768       1,393 \nThermal (Coal)   0     900       2,100 \nConventional Hydropower  1,205        1,335  1,335 \nRenewable     153     317     622 \n         Total  2,580  4,320  5,450 \nPeak Demand  1,922  2,921  3,943 \n                   Source: Government of Sri Lanka. \n \n11.  Enabling  Regulatory  Environment  and  Sector  Reforms.  The  Government \nestablished the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) in 2002 as a regulator for \nenergy and water sectors under the PUCSL Act 2002. The Electricity Reform Act, 2002, was \nintroduced to empower PUCSL to issue licenses and determine electricity tariffs. However, the \nact did not become fully effective because of the failure of the previous sector reform program \nand  PUCSL  has  been  only  advising  the  Government  on  policy  decisions,  including  tariff \nsettings.  To  complete  the  regulatory  reform,  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  was  passed  by \nParliament in March 2009 to replace the Electricity Reform Act.  \n \n12.  CEB  Corporate  Plan  and  Functional  Business  Unit.  CEB  has  converted  its \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution operations into six functional business units (FBUs) \n(one for generation, one for transmission, and four for distribution). Financial accounts have \nbeen segregated so that each FBU will operate as a profit center. CEB has developed a long-\nterm corporate plan that sets strategic objectives for each FBU based on a corporate vision and \ngoals. The corporate plan will be a basis for its internal reform exercise. The performance of \neach FBU will be measured by key performance indicators to be identified under the corporate \nplan. Performance of each FBU will also be monitored by PUCSL through its conditions to grant \nlicenses to CEB. The corporate plan will also identify those functions that will be decentralized \nto the FBU level and those that will be centralized at the corporate level. A summary of the draft \ncorporate plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. Government approval of CEB\u2019s corporate plan \nin a form that is acceptable to ADB is a condition of effectiveness of each Loan and Grant \nagreement. \n      \n ", "4   \n13.  Clean  Energy  Development. The country\u2019s primary energy sources are indigenous \nbiomass (47% of the total in 2003), imported petroleum products (45% in 2003) and hydropower \n(8% in 2003). About half of the country\u2019s hydropower potential has already been exhausted. Sri \nLanka\u2019s limited options are therefore more use of indigenous resources, less consumption of \nfossil fuels, and diversification into cheaper fuels. At the end of 2008, there were 73 small \nhydropower plants of 138 MW, one wind power plant of 3 MW, and three biomass plants of 12 \nMW. It is estimated that the country has technical potential for 24,000 MW of renewable energy \nincluding biomass, wind and small hydropower plants. The TYDF aims to (i) increase the \npercentage of households electrified through the off-grid supply from 4% at present to 10% by \n2016; (ii) increase the share of nonconventional renewable energy in the on-grid power supply \nfrom 4.1% at present to 10.7%; and (iii) add at least 500 MW of renewable energy capacity by \n2016. Table 2 shows Sri Lanka\u2019s renewable energy development plan to FY2016. \n \nTable 2: Renewable Energy Development Plan \n(MW) \nItem  FY2008  FY2012  FY2016 \nBiomass  12  20  50 \nSmall Hydropower  138  219  419 \nWind  3   78  153 \nTotal  153  317  622 \n                        Source: Sustainable Energy Authority. \n \n14.  In October 2007, the Government established the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), a \nfocal  agency  mandated  to  develop  and  implement  national  policy  for  renewable  energy \ndevelopment, energy efficiency improvements, and energy conservation. It also introduced new \ntechnology-specific  multi-tier  tariffs  to  attract  more  private  investment  to  nonconventional \nrenewable energy projects. Although these initiatives have created an institutional framework to \npromote the development of renewable energy projects, lack of grid capacity remains a major \ntechnical bottleneck for clean energy development through private sector investment.  \n \n15.  Transmission and Distribution Network Development. CEB completed a master plan \nstudy for the development of the transmission system in Sri Lanka in 2006 and prepared a long-\nterm  transmission  development  plan  (LTDP)  until  2015.  LTDP  has  identified  significant \ninvestment needs in the transmission system to (i) evacuate power generated from new power \nplants  planned  under  the  LGEP;  (ii)  improve  overall  system  reliability  and  efficiency;  \n(iii) facilitate rural electrification; and (iv) facilitate grid integration of renewable energy projects. \nIn 2008, the transmission and distribution loss was estimated to be 15% of net generation. \nThese losses are partly technical, e.g., overheating cables and transformers, because of the \nexcessive current caused by the unplanned connection of new customers, and by the non-\nimplementation of planned improvements to the network because of financial constraints. The \nGovernment  aims  to  reduce  the  overall  losses  to  12%  by  2016  by  accelerating  the \nstrengthening of the transmission and distribution network. The Government will also make a \nparallel effort to upgrade and improve the meters and the metering system, and to strengthen \nsurveillance to prevent theft, especially in suburban and rural areas.  \n \n16.  Rural  Electrification. By the end of 2008, 82% of total households had electricity \nconnections. Most of those without access to electricity lived in rural areas. The Government is \ncommitted to an interim target of 86% by 2010 and an ultimate target of 98% (88% on-grid and \n10% off-grid) by 2016. While some areas can be electrified by closing the gaps in the existing \nnetwork, most villages yet to be electrified require off-grid electricity services. Another major \n ", "  5\nchallenge in suburban and rural areas is low penetration in electrified villages. Even though \ndistribution feeders have reached their neighborhood, many households remain unconnected as \nthey cannot afford to pay connection charges. To reduce this financial burden, the Government \nplans to expand a credit support program piloted by an ADB-funded project.4 \n \n17.  Demand-Side Management. The SEA is mandated to develop and implement policies \nto  reduce  consumption  and  achieve  better  energy  efficiency  in  residential,  municipal  and \nindustrial users. The Government has identified eight priority areas: (i) power factor correction in \ntransmission networks, (ii) efficiency improvements in lighting applications in residential and \ncommercial  buildings and  lighting  grids,  (iii)  industrial  boilers,  (iv)  air-conditioning  systems,  \n(v) compressed air systems, (vi) industrial motors and drives, (vii) fans and air blow installations, \nand (viii) municipal water and irrigation pumps and lighting systems. The Government also plans \nto promote compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and introduced mandatory labeling in 2007. It \nplans to complete the program by 2010. In addition, the Government is preparing to update the \nCFL program and to introduce a mandatory energy efficiency building code.  \n \n18.  Debt Restructuring and Tariff Rationalization. In 2005, the Government wrote off \nSLRs7.8 billion of CEB\u2019s deferred tax and other payment arrears to the Treasury and made \ndirect payments of SLRs3.5 billion to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on behalf of CEB. The \nrestructuring plan for CEB\u2019s long-term debt of SLRs61 billion was approved by the Government \nin April 2006. Half of the long-term liabilities have been converted to equity and half have been \nrescheduled. At the end of 2008, CEB has a total long-term liability of SLRs 31 billion.  \n \n19.   To  ensure  electricity  prices  reflect  the  cost  of  supply  and  improve  revenues,  the \nGovernment has rationalized the tariff structure so that all the recurrent expenses of CEB will be \nmet by the tariffs. In March 2008, the Government introduced a new tariff structure increasing \naverage retail tariffs by about 30%. The increases will mainly affect domestic consumers, who \nhave been heavily cross-subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers. However, the \nimpact on \u201clifeline tariffs,\u201d considered necessary to maintain minimum living standards, has been \nminimized. Consumers with high domestic consumption have higher tariffs than those with low \nconsumption. A fuel surcharge now applies to all consumers. This is a significant change, and \ngives the domestic consumer greater incentives to save energy. Under the Sri Lanka Electricity \nAct, all tariffs must reflect costs; the costs of any subsidy approved by the Government will be \nborne by the Treasury.      \n  \n4.  External Assistance to the Sector and ADB Strategy  \n \n20.  ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank have been \nthe main development partners in the Sri Lanka power sector. The three institutions coordinated \nclosely on key policy issues and investment support. JICA has been the largest development \npartner in the sector, providing investment support for generation, transmission, and distribution. \nJointly with JICA, ADB provided a program loan5 for sector reforms and have jointly undertaken \npolicy dialogue with the Government. JICA has been active in the generation subsector and is \ncurrently funding the Upper Kotomale hydropower plant (150 MW) and a feasibility study for the \nuse of imported LNG for power generation. The World Bank has provided a line of credit for off-\ngrid electrification by the private sector.  Recently, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004. Proposed Grant Assistance to Sri Lanka for the Power Fund for the Poor.

Manila. \n ", "6   \nIndia have emerged as major development partners for the sector. A new coal-fired base load \npower plant of 300 MW is under construction, funded by the PRC. A 500 MW coal-fired plant is \nplanned in Trincomalee as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s power sector strategies in Sri Lanka are aligned with the TYDF and aim to \nimprove the coverage and efficiency of the services delivery by CEB and LECO by (i) increasing \nnonconventional  energy  sources;  (ii)  improving  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  promoting  rural \nelectrification; (iv) strengthening sector regulation; and (v) supporting CEB\u2019s internal reforms.  \nADB\u2019s activities will focus on (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) strengthening sector governance; \n(iii) improving access for the poor; and (iv) private sector participation. \n \n5.  Lessons \n \n22.  In 1998, the Government committed itself to carrying out sector reforms and embarked \non a program to restructure the power sector by unbundling CEB into separate functional \ncompanies  and  establishing  an  independent  regulator.  The  Government  introduced  the \nElectricity  Reform  Act,  2002  to  provide  a  legal  framework  for  the  program.  However,  the \nunbundling of CEB did not materialize because of opposition from within the ruling coalition and \nfrom the powerful labor unions. As the act was designed to enable PUCSL to start regulation \nfollowing the unbundling of CEB, regulatory reform has been at a standstill. As a result, in 2006 \nADB terminated the program loans to support the reform program as the second tranche \nconditions were unlikely to be fulfilled.     \n \n23.  The main reason the previous reform program did not succeed was that a CEB trade \nunion backed by a leftist party protested against the reform. Since the leftist party was a \nmember of the ruling coalition, the Government made a political choice not to unbundle CEB. \nSome members of the Government and CEB who believed that the most pressing need was to \nbuild  a  cheaper  base  load  capacity  rather  than  to  carry  out  reform  also  influenced  the \nGovernment decision. Some stakeholders also perceived the reform process to be donor-\ndriven. \n \n24.  Based on the lessons learned from the previous reform attempt, ADB encouraged the \nGovernment to conduct intensive consultations with stakeholders when preparing a fresh sector \ndevelopment program. The Government prepared the NEPS and had it approved by Parliament \nto ensure ownership by all political stakeholders. The Government has taken a pragmatic \napproach to this round of regulatory reform and as a result has faced less political resistance.  It \nleft CEB vertically integrated and delinked regulatory reform from the restructuring of CEB. It \ndecided  to  introduce  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act,  designed  to  encourage  efficiency \nimprovement by CEB by regulating each FBU. Recognizing these policy actions as a strong \nindication of the Government\u2019s commitment to reform, ADB resumed its support for the power \nsector by approving a TA project6 in December 2007 and a country operations business plan \nwhich includes the current Project.  The Sri Lanka Electricity Act was passed by Parliament in \nMarch 2009 to complete the regulatory reform. \n   \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

Impact and Outcome \n25.  The Project aims to realize affordable and reliable power supply for sustained and \ninclusive economic growth by improving the coverage and service efficiency of CEB and LECO. \n \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The  outputs  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  for  the  efficiency  improvement  component,  a \nstronger transmission and distribution network and demand-side management of municipal \nstreet lighting; (ii) for the renewable energy development component, the removal of network \nbottlenecks for small hydropower plants; (iii) for the access for the poor component, a stronger \ntransmission network in the Eastern Province and an expanded credit support program for \nservice connections in the selected provinces. The details of each investment part are provided \nin Appendix 4.   \n \nC.  Special Features  \n1.  Climate Change Mitigation \n \na.  Support  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Small  Hydropower \nDevelopment \n \n27.  In  Sri  Lanka,  the  private  sector  has  been  active  in  investing  in  small  hydropower \nstations. So far, 73 projects with total capacity of 138 MW have been developed by private \ninvestors. However, because of lack of substation capacity, 40 new proposals with a total \ncapacity of 105 MW remain pending. To remove this bottleneck, the Project will finance the \nimprovement and construction of six substations, which will absorb an additional 200 MW from \nnew small hydropower plants. This will help reduce CO  equivalent emissions by about 500,000 \n2\ntons per year. \n \nb.  Capacity Development for Renewable Energy Development \n  \n28.  An appropriate policy and regulatory framework is critical to promoting private sector \nparticipation in renewable energy. ADB has approved technical assistance for capacity building \nof  the  SEA,  a  focal  agency  responsible  for  nationwide  planning  of  renewable  energy \ndevelopment and approval of individual projects (footnote 6). PUCSL will also play a pivotal role \nthrough licensing and tariff setting. Since 2002, ADB has been actively involved in establishing \nPUCSL and has provided technical assistance to develop regulatory rules and codes.  Together \nwith the capacity building support for PUCSL under the Project, ADB will support renewable \nenergy development from policy, regulatory and investment perspectives.      \n \nc.   Energy Efficiency Improvement through Innovative Approaches \n \n29.  The Project is designed to promote demand-side management through an innovative \nenergy service company (ESCO) model.7 Management contracts for implementation of the \n                                                 \n7  The ESCO model is a business model under which the ESCO provides for investments and installs energy-saving \nequipment in industrial, municipal or residential facilities, which become the ESCO\u2019s clients. The ESCO client \nfurnishes the repayment toward the investment from the cost savings realized due to the reduced electricity \nconsumption.  \n ", "8   \ndemand-side management part will be handled by utility ESCO units to be set up in CEB and \nLECO. The realized energy savings will be deposited in the ESCO\u2019s escrow accounts and used \nto finance further energy efficiency projects in CEB and LECO service areas. The ESCO service \nmarket is still quite immature in Sri Lanka, and requires further strengthening and support from \nthe donor community. The utility ESCO model will be more appropriate for initiating demand-\nside  management  programs  for  customers  with  capital  shortages,  such  as  municipal \ngovernments.  \n \n2.  Sector Governance \n \n30.  Since 2006, ADB has been conducting an intensive policy dialogue with the Government \nto strengthen sector governance. With a new regulatory regime launched under the Sri Lanka \nElectricity Act, ADB will redirect its support from development of the regulatory framework to its \nimplementation. To ensure effective regulation, capacity development of PUCSL and CEB will \nbe critical. The Project will provide associated technical assistance to (i) help PUCSL conduct a \nlicensing and tariff review; (ii) support CEB to prepare licensing applications and tariff petitions; \n(iii) facilitate interaction between PUCSL and CEB; and (iv) support implementation of CEB\u2019s \ncorporate plan.  \n \n 3.  Scaling-Up Access for the Poor  \n \n31.  In Sri Lanka, many households remain unconnected because they cannot afford to pay \nconnection charges even though distribution feeders have already reached their neighborhood. \nHowever, some of these households may have the capacity to repay a loan or to pay the \nconnection charges in monthly installments over 2\u20133 years. To address this issue, in 2004, ADB \napproved a microfinance scheme funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction\u2014the Power \nFund  for  the  Poor  (footnote  4).  The  fund  has  been  successfully  implemented  by  two \nparticipating credit institutions in collaboration with CEB and a local organization specializing in \nthe energy sector and has electrified more than 10,000 poor households in eight districts while \nmaintaining a recovery ratio of more than 95%. As evidenced by the high recovery ratio, target \nhouseholds are able to pay once they get connected, with technical and institutional support \nfrom the organizations involved. The Project aims to scale-up the fund through a loan-funded \ncredit support program and is expected to provide electricity connection to at least 60,000 poor \nhouseholds, including those living in areas affected by conflict. This represents 8% of the total \nnumber of poor households. This will provide significant support to the achievement of the \nGovernment\u2019s goal of increasing the household electrification ratio through grid connections \nfrom the present 82% to 88% by 2016. \n \n4.  Development of Conflict-Affected Areas \n \n 32.  Some parts of the Project will be implemented in Eastern Province, which has long been \nneglected by major public investments. It has a history of political, economic, and security \ninstability over the last 3 decades, mainly because of the conflict between the Government and \nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Its population is 41% Tamil, 32% Muslim, and 27% \nSinhalese. Since securing the province and declaring it safe in July 2007, the Government has \nembarked on a \u201cReawakening the East\u201d program to integrate the province into the mainstream \neconomy. The Government held council elections in the province on 10 May 2008, which were \nkeenly contested by all the major parties. The elections were the first for 20 years. The access \nfor  the  poor  component  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  overall  strategies  on  regional \ndevelopment, poverty reduction, and ethnic integration and will benefit all communities in the \n ", "  9\nprovince. It will improve CEB\u2019s capacity to cater to the expected increase in the province\u2019s \nhousehold and industrial demand.  \n  \nD.  Project Investment Plan and Cost Estimates \n33.  The project investment cost is estimated at $188.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$3.8 million. It consists of $147 million in foreign exchange costs and $41.2 million in equivalent \nlocal costs. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \ncharges during implementation.

Financing Plan \n \n34.   The Government has asked ADB to provide two loans, one of $135 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  to  finance  parts  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  and  7,  and  one  of  SDR \n16,843,000  ($25  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund) to finance parts 7 and 8. Part 4 will be jointly funded by two separate grants, one for $2.2 \nmillion from the Climate Change Fund and one for $2 million from the Government of Japan.8 \nDisbursement for part 4 will be made from the two funding sources on a pro-rata basis. ADB will \nnot finance tax and duties or financing charges.  \n \n35.  The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \n                                                 \n8 Through the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by \nADB. Allocation of the fund between CEB and LECO will decided by ADB based on project preparedness and \nprogress by each agency.    \n ", "10  \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. $114.4 million of the OCR loan will \nbe relent to CEB for Parts 1,2,5,6 and 7 and $20.6 million to LECO for Part 3 under a subsidiary \nfinancing agreements between the Government and CEB and LECO, on terms satisfactory to \nADB.   \n \n36.  The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an \ninterest change of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nportion of the ADF loan intended for part 7 (SDR 14,485,000) will be relent to CEB, and the \nbalance (SDR 2,358,000) for part 8 will be transferred by the Government to CEB as a grant.  \nRelending of the proceeds of the ADF loan to CEB as loan and grant will be under a subsidiary \nfinancing  agreement  between  the  Government  and  CEB,  on  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n \n37.  The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the Executing Agency of the Project. \nThe CEB will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for all parts. LECO shall, jointly with CEB, \nimplement parts 3 and 4 (distribution substations augmentation and demand-side management \nparts). Day-to-day project implementation will be done by project implementation units (PIUs), \nwhich will be set up in CEB and LECO. These will work exclusively for the Project and will be \nheaded  by  senior  officers.    The  organizational  structure  of  the  PIUs  is  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Full-time project managers and supervisors with qualified staff will \nbe  appointed  to  supervise  each  part.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation, including procurement, accounting, and social and environmental issues and \ncoordination with concerned agencies. In addition, the CEB\u2019s PIU will coordinate closely with the \n ", " 11\nprocurement committee, which will be appointed by the cabinet or MOPE depending on the size \nof contracts. \n \n38.  Distribution  Substations  Augmentation  Part.  This will be implemented initially by \nLECO,  and  subsequently  by  CEB  who  will  take  over  the  project  assets  and  associated \nsubsidiary debt from LECO and undertake operation and maintenance.  \n \n39.  Demand-Side Management Part. This will be implemented by both CEB and LECO in \ntheir respective jurisdictions.9 MOPE will issue a policy circular to delegate responsibility for \nmunicipal street lighting in selected areas from municipal authorities to CEB and LECO. With \nthe associated ADB technical assistance, they will then establish internal ESCO units within \nwhich  escrow  accounts  will  be  established  to  accumulate  energy  savings  gains.  Upon \ncompletion of the payback period of the initial investments by the ESCO units, energy savings \nwill create an additional revenue stream to that generated by tariffs. It is envisioned that a \npercentage of the energy savings gains accumulated in the escrow account will be reinvested in \nother  energy  efficiency  projects  identified  by  the  ESCO  unit  as  part  of  its  operational \nresponsibilities. Appendix 6 contains a description of the demand-side management part and \nAppendix 10 a description of the associated TA.  \n \n40.  Rural Household Connection Part. This will be implemented by CEB with the support \nof service providers engaged under a performance-based contract on terms and conditions \nacceptable to ADB.  When a credit application is submitted to CEB from a customer household, \na service provider will assess the household\u2019s repayment capacity and CEB will confirm that \nthere  are  no  technical  difficulties  in  making  the  electricity  connection.  If  the  application  is \napproved, CEB will provide the service connection, the cost of which will be recorded as a loan \nto the customer in CEB\u2019s balance sheet and recovered in installments over 24\u201336 months. An \nescrow account will be set up in CEB to receive installment payments. Principal and interest \npayments from households will be credited to the account and used to provide new installment \ncredits. ADB will provide associated technical assistance for the detailed design of this part, \nincluding selection of service providers and capacity building of major stakeholders. Appendix 7 \ncontains a description of the rural household connection part and Appendix 10 a description of \nthe associated TA.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n41.   All parts except for the rural household connection part are expected to be completed \nby May 2013. For the rural household connection part, the loan is expected to be fully disbursed \nwithin 3 years and repayments from consumers will be revolved for new service connections. \nThe implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8.    \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n42.   Procurement of goods and services to be financed under the loans will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement  packages  except  for  part  4  (demand-side  management)  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Shopping procedures will \nbe used for part 4 (demand-side management) for procurement of standard specification goods \n                                                 \n9 As defined by CEB Act No. 17 of 1969 and the memorandum of association of Lanka Electricity Company (Private) \nestablished in 1983 under the Companies Act. In power distribution, LECO supplies power to Colombo and other \nurban areas in the western and coastal belt while CEB covers the remainder of the country.  \n ", "12  \nwith  estimated  costs  of  less  than  $100,000.  A  procurement  plan  and  indicative  contract \npackages are in Appendix 9. Any modifications to the procurement plan will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n43.  CEB and LECO have requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for the \nprocurement of goods up to 20% of the cumulative total of the OCR and ADF loans. ADB \nManagement has approved retroactive financing for all subprojects except for the demand-side \nmanagement subproject up to 20% of the proceeds from the loans, provided that expenditures \nare in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines and safeguard policies, and were incurred \nduring the 12 months before the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement. CEB \nand LECO were informed that approval of advance contracting or retroactive financing did not \ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  The  readiness  of  the  investment  parts  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  For implementation of part 1 (system control modernization), loan-funded consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  under  part  5  to  support  CEB  in  conducting  procurement  and \nconstruction supervision and also, on an intermittent basis, for operation and maintenance and \nliability issues during the defect liability period (12 months after commissioning). CEB will select \nand engage consultants using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures at a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using the full technical proposal method. Outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services are provided in Supplementary Appendix J. About 22 \nperson-months of international and 3 person-months of national consultants are expected to be \nrequired.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n45.   ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government, CEB, and LECO. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the IAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. Table 5 summarizes major governance \nmeasures.  \n \nTable 5: Governance Measures \n \nArea  Measure \nProcurement  \u2022  Use of ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) \n\u2022  Use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard request for proposal \ndocuments for procurement and recruitment of consultants \n\u2022  Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum competition \nunder international competitive bidding procedures \n ", " 13\nArea  Measure \nFinancial  \u2022  Measurable financial performance indicators for CEB and LECO annually \nManagement  evaluated by PUCSL  \nand Audit  \u2022  Regular monitoring of expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody \nof project-financed assets by the accounting and control systems of CEB and \nLECO  \n\u2022  Expanded use of advanced information and communication technology-based \nfinancial management systems to ensure efficient and accountable financial \nmanagement systems \n\u2022  Financial statements to be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and \nregularly published and reported to the shareholders  \nInstitutional  \u2022  Regulation of each FBU of CEB and LECO by PUCSL \n/Corporate  \u2022  Strengthened policy and regulatory framework to promote private sector \nGovernance  participation in renewable energy development and energy efficiency improvement  \n\u2022  Memorandum of performance between FBU heads and CEB Board \n\u2022  Transfer of street lighting operations from municipal authorities to ESCO units in \nCEB and LECO for selected areas \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board, ESCO = energy service company, FBU = \nfunctional business unit, LECO = Lanka Electricity Company, PUSCL = Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.  \nSource: Government of Sri Lanka. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n46.   Disbursement  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by \nthe  Government,  the  IAs  and  ADB.  Imprest  fund  procedures  will  be  used  to  facilitate \ndisbursement for part 8 while a commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used \nfor parts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 and reimbursement for part 4. One imprest account will be \nestablished for part 8. The ceiling of the initial advance of the imprest account will not exceed \nADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest \naccount for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount for part 8, whichever is lower.  \nStatement of expenditure procedures may be used under the reimbursement procedure for part \n4 and for liquidating advances for part 8. The statement of expenditure ceiling for individual \npayments applicable to reimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be $25,000 for part 4 \nand $100,000 for part 8.   \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n47.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The IAs \nwill maintain separate accounts for the different parts. Within 9 months of the close of the \nfinancial year, the IAs will submit (i) annual project accounts, with detailed descriptions of the \nsources of receipts and expenditures; and (ii) annual financial statements comprising an income \nstatement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and related notes to the financial statements \nand  consolidated  for  all  operations.  The  IAs  will  continue  the  current  practice  of  hiring \nindependent  chartered  accountants  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  their  financial  statements, \nproject  accounts,  and  the  procedures  for  the  imprest  accounts  and/or  statement  of \nexpenditures. The auditors will also prepare a memorandum on issues identified during the \naudit process, to be submitted with the respective reports. The auditors will be required to \nprovide  an  opinion  on  the  IAs\u2019  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants.  For  the  rural \nhousehold connection part, CEB will report to ADB every quarter, without limitation, on the \n(i) status of the escrow account (until the full loan amount is disbursed); (ii) overall portfolio \n ", "14  \nperformance; and (iii) the status of processing credit applications. If requested by ADB, CEB will \nprovide ADB with certification that the ADB funds have been used to provide service connection \nand that those who received credit under this project have been physically connected.              \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n48.  The IAs will prepare progress reports for their respective parts and submit these to ADB \nwithin 30 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide (i) a narrative description \nof progress made during the period, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems \nor difficulties encountered, (iv) the performance of the project implementation consultants, and \n(v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The report will also include summary financial \naccounts  for  the  parts,  consisting  of  project  expenditures  for  the  year  to  date  and  total \nexpenditure to date. Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n49.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. ADB will review the \nimplementation and operation of the projects based on the quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith the IAs and the Government twice a year to discuss the progress of each part of the Project \nand any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures that need to be taken. \nA  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  focusing  on  the \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing \nthe financial status of the IAs. The IAs will submit a project completion report to ADB within \n3 months of physical completion of the projects. \n  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n50.  The Project will include associated TA grants for advisory assistance to the Government \nfor (i) Capacity Development for Power Sector Regulation; (ii) Demand-Side Management for \nMunicipal Street Lighting; and (iii) Rural Household Connection. The financing plan for the TA \ngrants is in Table 6. \n \nTable 6: TA Financing Plan \n($ million) \nProject  ADB  Government  Total \nCapacity Development for Power Sector Regulation  1.0 (TASF)  0.25  1.25 \nDemand-Side Management for Municipal Street          0.8 (CCF)  0.2  1.0 \nLighting  \nRural Household Connection  2.0 (JSF)  0.5  2.5 \nTotal  3.8  0.95  4.75 \nCCF = Climate Change Fund, JSF = Japan Special Fund, TASF = Technical Assistance Special Fund. \n \n51.  Total cost of the TA projects is $4.75 million, out of which $3.8 million will be funded by \nADB and $0.95 million by the Government in kind. A summary of the TA projects are provided in \nAppendix 10 and details are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n52.  Capacity  Development  for  Power  Sector  Regulation.  The  TA  will  help  deliver \naffordable and reliable electricity to Sri Lankan consumers through effective regulation of the \npower  sector.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  regulation  of  the  sector  through \n(i) institutional and technical capacity development for PUCSL so it can effectively implement \n ", " 15\nregulation  under  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act  and  (ii)  institutional  and  technical  capacity \ndevelopment for CEB so it can comply with the requirements of the act.  \n \n53.  Demand-Side Management for Municipal Street Lighting. The TA will support the \nuse of utility energy service company (ESCO) units within CEB and LECO to implement the \ndemand-side management part. The TA will (i) assess the operational and functional structures \nin CEB and LECO to determine the optimal type of ESCO units and define their scope of work \nand responsibilities; (ii) propose financing mechanisms to fund the energy efficiency projects \nidentified by the ESCO units; and (iii) assess capacity building needs and develop training and \noutsourcing plans.   \n \n54.  Rural Household Connection. The TA aims to improve electricity access for the poor \nby supporting CEB to design a credit support program for rural household connection, select \nservice providers, and build the capacity of stakeholders.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Analysis \n55.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  Project,  excluding  the  demand-side \nmanagement and rural household connection parts. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwas  calculated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Detailed  cost  benefit \ncalculations show that the Project is expected to deliver net economic benefits, with a combined \nEIRR of 16.0%. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Financial Management Assessment and Financial Analysis \n  1.  Financial Management \n \n56.   A financial management assessment was undertaken to determine whether CEB and \nLECO  could  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  Project.  The  assessment  was  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines and used a financial management assessment questionnaire \nand  field  interviews.  In  CEB,  under  the  general  manager  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement,  additional  general  managers  manage  six  FBUs,  one  generation  unit,  one \ntransmission unit, and four distribution units in different areas. The finance division is headed by \na  finance  manager  and  two  additional  finance  managers  are  responsible  for  financial \nmanagement of the six FBUs.  \n \n57.  CEB's  accounting  records  are  manually  maintained  at  site  offices  and  monthly \nsummaries are forwarded to head office for consolidation under cost centers. For generation, \ncost centers are aggregated under two hydropower and thermal power units. Transmission \nactivities  are  another  cost  center. There  are  four  separate  cost centers  for  distribution  by \ngeographic coverage. Although the billing system is computerized, the accounting system is \nbased  on  spreadsheets.  Financial  management  and  the  accounting  system  should  be \nintegrated  and  computerized  to  improve  their  efficiency.  To  respond  quickly  to  regulatory \nrequirements and ultimately to customers\u2019 needs, routine financial matters will be delegated to \neach  FBU  while  corporate  financial  matters  such  as  treasury  operations  and  investment \nfinancing  will  be  centralized  at  the  finance  division.  Investment  in  a  more  sophisticated \nmanagement information system and accounting system is urgently needed to support the \ndelegation of financial responsibilities to FBUs and to monitor their financial performance.     \n \n ", "16  \n58.  CEB's annual accounts are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with Sri Lanka \nAccounting  Standards,  which  are  similar  to  the  International  Accounting  Standards.  The \naccounts are audited by the auditor general, who appoints a private firm as auditor. The firm is \nrotated periodically. Since CEB has a lot of experience in accounting and auditing for foreign \nloans that have been relent by the Government, audit reports and financial statements are well \nformatted. \n \n59.  LECO is a private limited liability company, with the majority of its shares owned by CEB \nand the Government. LECO has finance divisions located at its head office and seven branch \noffices. Each branch office produces a full set of financial statements, which are consolidated at \nthe head office. The head office finance division is headed by the finance manager, assisted by \na management accountant, a financial accountant, and support staff. The branch accountants \nreport to the finance manager. LECO\u2019s financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in \naccordance with Sri Lanka accounting standards. The accounts are audited by a private firm \naffiliated with an international accounting firm. LECO has experience of implementing externally \nfunded projects and has an internal audit department.  \n \n  2.  Financial Analysis \n \n60.  Financial Analysis of the Project.  A financial evaluation of the Project, excluding the \ndemand-side management and rural household connection parts, was carried out, based on \n2009 prices. The base case financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 8.5%, compared with a \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.9%, thus indicating the Project is financially \nviable. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to a range of project-related \nsensitivities. A summary of the financial analysis is provided in Appendix 12. \n \n61.  Financial Analysis of CEB. The recent tariff revision is expected to improve CEB's \nturnover significantly, coupled with a sharp decrease of oil prices due to the global financial \ncrisis. Once the coal fired plant becomes operational in 2012, CEB's financial position will be \nmore stable because of no need to purchase expensive power from IPPs. To ensure the \nfinancial sustainability of CEB, the least cost generation plans need to be implemented as \nscheduled. Operationally, CEB should also maintain, (i) an account receivable collection of less \nthan 2 months; (ii) a debt to equity ratio of 70:30; and debt service coverage of 1.2 from 2012. \nCEB\u2019s financial performance and projections are provided in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \nC.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development   \n62.  The Project will help to enhance social and economic inclusion and the integration of \nmarginalized people. On-grid electricity is a cleaner source of energy than kerosene and access \nto it will improve health, hygiene, and sanitation. More hours can be devoted to studying and \naccess to information, awareness, and knowledge will improve. For low-income households, the \neducational level of children will increase. Mobility and security will be enhanced, particularly for \npeople who have suffered from attacks by wild animals while searching for their food10 and who \nhave been affected by the conflict. Household lighting brings about an overall improvement in \nliving standards. Electricity is a less expensive source of energy than kerosene and wood that \nneeds to be fetched. Households carrying out home-based economic activities will generate \nmore household income, be more productive because they can work longer working hours, \noperate faster machinery, and spend less time searching for energy sources. \n                                                 \n10 During a field visit in Hambantota (which was electrified by the Power Fund for the Poor), it was reported that \nelectrification had greatly reduced the risks of villagers being attacked by elephants.   \n ", " 17\n \n63.  In  urban  areas,  the  Project  will  ensure  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity,  benefiting \nhouseholds, small and medium-sized businesses (possibly leading to job creation), and public \nservices, including schools and hospitals. High oil prices are deterring investors from investing \nin projects that rely heavily on generators. The Project will bring power to industrial districts11 \nwhere industries that currently rely on generators will be able to improve their productivity. It will \nalso encourage new investments and therefore create jobs.  \n   \n64.  The Project will contribute directly to the development of the Eastern Province, which is \none of the poorest provinces in Sri Lanka.12 It contains Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim population \nand has been severely affected by the conflict. The coastal part of the province (populated \nmainly by Tamils and Muslims) was severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.  To \nensure regional balance, the Project is also designed to benefit other poorer provinces. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13.    \n \nD.  Social and Environmental Safeguards  \n \n  1.  Social Safeguards \n \n65.  The Project will not entail any land acquisition. About 480 ha of private land might be \ntemporarily affected by the erection of transmission towers and stringing of transmission lines. \nAs  a  result,  a  maximum  of  1,800  households  might  be  temporarily  affected,  although  not \nsignificantly. As far as possible, CEB will ensure that construction of towers and stringing of \nlines will not be carried out during the cropping season to reduce the impact on the local rice \ncrop.  \n \n66.  A short resettlement plan has been prepared by CEB for the transmission and substation \nparts (except for part 1, which will not have any adverse social impact). No direct impact is \nforeseen  on  indigenous  peoples  so  no  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  has  been \nprepared. However, special provisions were added to the resettlement plan to ensure additional \ncompensation  is  paid  to  vulnerable  groups,  including  indigenous  peoples.  A  summary \nresettlement plan is provided in Appendix 14. The resettlement plan has been uploaded on the \nADB website and is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n  2.  Environmental Safeguards \n \n67.  CEB and LECO have prepared initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for parts 1, 2, \n3,  6,  and  7.  CEB  has  held  public  consultation  meetings.  All  grid  substations  planned  for \naugmentation  are  located  within  the  existing  premises  of  either  CEB  or  LECO.  Minimal \nenvironmental impacts are expected from the siting of new facilities. All grid substations already \nhave  storm  water  drainage  through  covered  surface  drains.  During  the  construction  and \noperation phase, measures will be taken to minimize environmental impacts. Some potential \nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction of the proposed 132 kV transmission \nlines are anticipated. To minimize these, CEB has observed the route selection criteria set out in \nthe  national  regulations  and  has  adopted  best  environmental  practices.  In  general, \nenvironmental impacts are ranked low or low to medium and have been adequately addressed \nthrough  mitigation  measures  in  the  environmental  management  plans  prepared  for  each \n                                                 \n11 One substation to be constructed under the Project will only serve the Pallekelle industrial park, where a number of \ninvestments are dependent on the availability of on-grid electricity, which is currently unavailable. \n12 Department of Census and Statistics. 2002. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Colombo. \n ", "18  \nsubproject. Both CEB and LECO have sufficient capacity to implement the safeguard measures \nbased on the Plans. ADB has classified the Project environmental category B. The summary \nIEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nE.  Potential Risks and Assumptions \n \n68.  The major assumptions are that (i) the Government will remain committed to power \nsector reforms; (ii) the long-term generation expansion plan (LGEP) will be implemented in a \ntimely manner; and (iii) the Sri Lanka Electricity Act will be efficiently implemented for PUCSL to \nregulate the sector. \n \n69.  The Government\u2019s commitment to sector reform is demonstrated by the fact that it has \n(i) provided financial support for the implementation of CEB\u2019s long-term debt restructuring plan; \n(ii) submitted the NEPS for the parliamentary approval, which is not required for a policy \ndocument,  and  gazetted  it;  and  (iii)  substantially  increased  retail  tariffs  to  improve  CEB\u2019s \nfinancial position. CEB has drafted its first long-term corporate plan, which it is using as a basis \nfor its internal reform exercise. The Government has already secured financing for the priority \nprojects in LGEP and three projects totaling 950 MW are being implemented. \n \n70.  Parliament has passed the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in March 2009 and PUCSL has \nstarted regulating the power sector. Although there is a risk that PUCSL and CEB make lack \ncapacity to operate effectively under the new regulatory framework, this will be substantially \nmitigated by ADB\u2019s technical assistance for capacity development of the two agencies and \nPUCSL\u2019s experience in supporting the Government\u2019s policy-making over the past 4 years.       \n \n71.  Other  risks  to  the  implementation  of  the  investment  projects  include  (i)  delays  in \nassociated generation investments, (ii) delays in project implementation and resulting project \ncost escalation, and (iii) a deterioration of the security situation in the Eastern Province. These \nrisks also appear to be low. A policy and regulatory framework is already in place to streamline \nthe Government approval process for renewable energy projects. SEA has been established as \na focal agency for renewable energy development and is being supported by an ADB TA to \nexpedite the review of the pending small hydropower projects that will be promoted by the \nProject.  All  the  subprojects  under  the  Project  are  ready  for  implementation  and  advance \nprocurement will help expedite project implementation and mitigate the risk of cost overruns. As \nthe Government is now taking full control in the Eastern Province, no difficulty is foreseen in \nimplementing  the  subprojects.  The  associated  technical  assistance  will  help  design \nimplementation arrangement of the projects.    \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n72.

Sector Situation and Key Issues in the Sector \n \n  1.    Sector Situations \n \n1.  Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector struggled throughout the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s to \nmeet the growing demand for electricity. Given that demand for power is growing by about 8% \nper  year,  the  country  faces  serious  power  shortages  after  2008,  which  would  significantly \nimpede economic growth. Sri Lanka\u2019s national electrification ratio1 improved significantly from \n10.9% in 1986 to 82% in 2008 and compares favorably to those in other South Asian countries. \nHowever, substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist. As of the end 2008, per capita \nelectricity consumption stood at about 492 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is lower than that in India \nor Pakistan. System losses are estimated at 16.7%. While this is relatively low compared to the \naverage of South Asia, there is still room to reduce losses by another 4%\u20135%. Table A2.1 \nshows key electricity data for four South Asian countries.  \n \nTable A2.1: Key Electricity Data for Four South Asian Countries \nSri Lanka  Bangladesh  Pakistan  India \n \n(2008)  (2005)  (2005)  (2005) \nInstalled Generation Capacity (MW)  2,580  4,995  19,540  132,329 \n(Mar 2007) \nElectricity Consumption per Capita (kWh)  492  N/A  398  606 \nSystem Losses (%)          15.0  25.0  25.0  40 \u2013 50 \nElectrified Households (%)          82.0  32.0  54.0  44.0 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.   In  Sri  Lanka,  the  total  power  generation  capacity  available  to  the  grid  was  2,580 \nmegawatts  (MW)  at  the  end  of  2008.  Of  the  total  energy  provided  to  the  grid,  37.4%  is \nhydropower, 58.2% is thermal (oil), and 4.4 % is nonconventional renewable energy. Ceylon \nElectricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) are the only two utilities in the \npower  sector.  CEB,  an  integrated  utility  fully  owned  by  the  Government  and  engaged  in \ngeneration, transmission and distribution of electricity, has installed generation capacity of 1,725 \nMW and serves about 90% of all customers. LECO was formed as a distribution company under \nthe Companies Act and most of its shares are owned by CEB and the Government.  Municipal \nauthorities are minority shareholders. LECO purchases bulk power from CEB and distributes it \nto about 400,000 consumers in Colombo and other urban areas in the western and costal belt, \nrepresenting about 10% of all consumers. The private sector is currently only in the generation \nsector and has a total capacity of 705 MW. \n     \n  2.    Key Issues \n \n3.  About 20% of households do not have access to electricity, which is expensive and \nsubject to interruptions. CEB is burdened with debt, restricting its capacity to make capital \ninvestments by CEB and discouraging private investments in the sector.  \n \n4.  High Cost of Generation. The share of thermal power in the power generation mix has \nincreased dramatically from 1% in 1986 to 58% in 2008 as the entire growth in demand has \nbeen served by oil-fired thermal generation. The 1998 policy of building thermal power plants \n                                                 \n1 The ratio of electrified households to total households. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nwith private financing has resulted in a proliferation of relatively small high-cost oil-fired plants. \nPoor  political  decisions  and  a  lack  of  financial  resources  have  prevented  CEB  from \nimplementing the least-cost generation plan, using coal as the most economical source of \nenergy.  The  move  toward  oil-fired  plants,  the  increase  in  the  oil  price,  and  the  delayed \nconstruction of new hydropower plants have significantly pushed up the cost of generation. \nThere is an urgent need to build up base load generation capacity with low-cost fuels, such as \nimported coal, and to invest in hydropower and other renewable resources.  \n \n5.  Skewed Tariff Structure. The dramatic increase in generation costs since 1998 has not \nbeen passed on to electricity consumers since the Government, as the regulator, has had \nneither the political will to pass on the cost increases to consumers nor the technical capacity to \nevaluate the CEB\u2019s cost structure to decide on the appropriate level of tariffs. As a result, CEB \nhas posted an operating loss since 2000 and accumulated its liability. Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity \ncustomers, particularly commercial and industrial customers and large households, pay higher \nprices than most of their regional comparators. A reduction in the cost of supply is urgently \nneeded, coupled with a stable and high-quality supply of electricity. \n \n6.  Inadequate and Aging Transmission and Distribution Network. Retail tariffs, which \ndo  not  reflect  the  cost  of  supply,  coupled  with  CEB\u2019s  institutional  weakness  in  project \nimplementation, have continued to squeeze its investments in transmission and distribution. The \nlow-voltage distribution network requires improvements if it is to meet the expansion in housing \nand commercial developments. Overdue investment in the medium-voltage distribution network \nhas caused overloading, poor reliability and fluctuating voltage at many locations. The growth in \ndemand for power distributed over the medium-voltage network requires a matching investment \nin the transmission network and grid substations. Immediate investments in the transmission \nand distribution network are needed, not only to reduce system losses and to ensure the \nstability  of  the  entire  power  system  but  also  to  encourage  private  sector  investment  in \nnonconventional renewable energy.   \n   \n7.  High Commercial Losses and Lack of Penetration in Rural Areas. The low customer \ndensity in suburban and rural areas causes higher network losses than in urban areas. In \nparallel with network strengthening, further efforts are needed to upgrade and improve meters \nand  metering  systems  and  to  enforce  strict  surveillance  to  prevent  theft.  Another  major \nchallenge in rural areas is low penetration in electrified villages. Even in neighborhoods already \nreached by distribution feeders, many households remain unconnected as they cannot afford to \npay connection charges.   \n   \nB.  Government Policy and Planning Framework \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  Ten-Year  Development  Framework  (TYDF)  prepared  in  2006 \nenvisions  \u201csustainable  development  of  energy  resources,  conversion  facilities  and  delivery \nsystems to enable access to and use of energy services by the entire population, and the safe, \nreliable delivery of such energy services at a regionally competitive price, through commercially \nviable institution subjected independent regulation.\u201d2 To underpin the TYDF, the Government \ndeveloped the national energy policy and strategies (NEPS), which is a comprehensive sector \ndevelopment road map, including a long-term investment program as well as policy and reform \nmeasures. It aims to (i) supply electricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and \n(ii) adopt electricity tariffs that are comparable with those of other countries and sufficient for \nutilities  to  be  viable.  The  Government  gazetted  the  NEPS  in  June  2008.  It  is  based  on  \n                                                 \n2  Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LGEP) \n \n7.  In the short term, generation costs are expected to continue to increase, reflecting oil \nprices, and the commissioning of the oil-fired Kerawalapitiya Thermal Power Station (600 MW) \nin 2008\u20132009. In the medium term, the Government aims to reverse this trend and start to bring \ndown the cost with by adding three coal-fired plants\u2014Puttalam (900 MW), Trincomalee (500 \nMW),  Hambantota  (600  MW)\u2014and  Upper  Kotomale  hydropower  plant  (150  MW)  and  an \nadditional 500 MW of renewable energy. The Government has imposed a moratorium on oil-\nburning power plants until non-oil sources provide 90% of grid energy. The first phase of the \nPuttalam thermal power project (300 MW) is under construction with funding from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Trincomalee is under preparation as a joint venture project between National \nThermal Power Corporation of India and CEB. Hambantota, a proposed independent power \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nproducer, is selecting a private investor.

Enabling Regulatory Environment and Sector Reforms   \n \n8.  The Government established the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) in \n2002 as a regulator for the energy and water sectors under the PUCSL Act, 2002. However, \nalthough the act ensures the independent status of PUCSL staff, the final authority for issuing \nlicenses  and  determining  electricity  tariffs  is vested  in  the  Government  (PUCSL  has  been \nadvising the Government on policy decisions, including setting tariffs). In order to transfer these \npowers to PUCSL and to empower it to regulate the sector fully, Parliament has passed the Sri \nLanka Electricity Act in March 2009. The first licenses to CEB, LECO, and the utilities will be \nissued within 6 months from its enactment.   \n \n9.  CEB  has  converted  its  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  operations  into  six \nfunctional  business  units  (FBUs),  one  for  generation,  one  for  transmission,  and  four  for \ndistribution. Financial accounts have been segregated so that each FBU will operate as a profit \ncenter. PUCSL will regulate each FBU separately and issue individual licenses. The board of \nCEB will delegate to the respective heads of the FBU all day-to-day management and the power \nto take all decisions to fulfill the obligations of the FBU under its license, including all financial \npowers to make capital and other investments, recruit personnel, and incur revenue expenses \nto the extent required to ensure the FBU achieves its revenue targets as approved by PUCSL. \nThe board will also authorize the heads of FBUs to delegate some of the functions of the FBU to \nits officers. A memorandum of performance to be signed between the heads of FBUs and the \nboard to ensure that FBU heads will (i) fulfill the license conditions; (ii) achieve the performance \nstandards set by the regulator; and (iii) have both administrative and financial autonomy to \nmanage the FBU within the stipulations of the license. \n    \n  3.  Clean Energy Development \n \n10.  The country\u2019s primary energy sources are indigenous biomass (47% of the total in \n2003), imported petroleum products (45% in 2003) and hydropower (8% in 2003).  About half of \nthe  country\u2019s  hydropower  potential  has  been  already  exhausted.  Increased  penetration  of \nindigenous resources, reduced consumption of fossil fuels and diversification into cheaper fuels \nare, therefore, the limited options available to Sri Lanka. At the end of 2008, there were 73 small \nhydropower plants with a total capacity of 138 MW, one 3 MW wind power plant, and three  \nbiomass plants of 12MW. It is estimated that Sri Lanka has the potential to generate 24,000 MW \nof renewable energy, including from biomass, wind, and small hydropower plants. The TYDF \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \naims to (i) increase the percentage of households electrified through off-grid supply from 4% at \npresent to 10% by 2016; (ii) increase the share of nonconventional renewable energy in on-grid \npower supply from 4.1% at present to 10.7%; (iii) add at least 500 MW of renewable energy \ncapacity  by  2016.  Table  A2.4  shows  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  renewable  energy  development  plan  to \nFY2016. \n \nTable A2.4: Renewable Energy Development Plan \n(MW) \nItem  FY2008  FY2012      FY2016 \nBiomass  12  20  50 \nMini Hydropower  138  219  419 \nWind  3  78  153 \n       \n     Total  153  317  622 \n  Source: Sustainable Energy Authority. \n \n11.  In October 2007, the Government established the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), \nwith a mandate to develop and implement policy for renewable energy development, energy \nefficiency, and energy conservation. SEA has provided an institutional framework to promote \ndevelopment of renewable energy projects through private investment. SEA will play a pivotal \nrole  in  promoting  renewable  energy  development  by  helping  private  sector  investors  to  \n(i) identify potential projects; (ii) obtain government clearances; (iii) gain access to government \nsubsidies from the Sri Lanka sustainable energy fund managed by SEA; and (iv) enter into a \npower purchase agreement with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). It will also develop and \nimplement new policies and financing schemes for renewable energy development, energy \nefficiency improvement, and energy conservation. The Government recently introduced new \ntechnology-specific  multi-tier  tariffs  to  attract  more  private  investment  to  nonconventional \nrenewable energy projects. \n \n12.  Lack of grid capacity remains a major technical bottleneck for the development of clean \nenergy sources. In Sri Lanka, private investors have been actively investing in small hydropower \nplants. However, a large number of proposals for new projects are pending because of a lack of \nsubstation  capacity.  Eight  grid  substations  have  been  identified  for  immediate  capacity \nimprovement, which would bring an additional 200 MW of clean energy to the grid.  \n \n  4.  Transmission and Distribution Network Development \n \n13.  System Expansion and Strengthening. CEB has completed a master plan for the \ntransmission system in 2006 and a long-term transmission development plan (LTDP) to 2015. \nThe  LTDP  has  identified  the  significant  investment  needs  in  the  transmission  system  as \n(i) evacuating the power that will be generated from new power plants planned under the LGEP; \n(ii) improving overall system reliability and efficiency; (iii) facilitating rural electrification; and  \n(iv) facilitating grid integration of renewable energy projects.  \n \n14.  The power plants scheduled to be commissioned by 2016 will require an investment of \n$296 million in associated evacuation lines. For reliable and efficient grid management, the \npresent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system needs to be replaced by a \nsystem  that  can  ensure  real-time  network  operations.  Investments  in  the  medium-voltage  \nnetwork have been significantly delayed because of a lack of finance, causing overloading, \nunreliability, and poor voltage profiles at many locations. Grid substations and transmission lines \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nneed  to  be  strengthened  in  areas  with  particularly  weak  medium-voltage  networks  and \nwidespread problems, including the North-Central, Eastern, and Uva provinces. Demand growth \non the medium-voltage network will require matching investments in the transmission network \nand  grid  substations.  The  low  voltage  distribution  network  also  requires  continuous \nimprovements to meet the expansion in housing and commercial developments, and to provide \nadditional distribution substations to ensure a reliable electricity supply of specified quality. In \naddition to expansion, the ageing sections of the network have to be replaced, and outdated \ncontrol and protection systems have to be upgraded. The investment plan for the transmission \nand distribution network to 2016 is provided in Table A2.5. \n \nTable A2.5: Transmission and Distribution Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Total \nOngoing Projects  82 \nStrengthening of Grid Substations and    552 \nTransmission Lines \nNew Power Plant Connection  296 \nOther Transmission System  52 \nMedium-Voltage and Low-Voltage Distribution  248 \n     Total  1,230 \n  Source: Government of Sri Lanka. \n \n15.  Loss Reduction. CEB\u2019s transmission and distribution losses have been between 15% \nand 17% of net generation over the past two decades (although they increased to about 21% in \n2000,  because  of  the  excessive  number  of  connections  without  meters).  The  number  of \nconnections without meters has now been reduced to a minimum. While the losses have now \nreverted to the pre-2000 levels, they are significantly above the optimal levels of about 12%. In \n2008, the transmission and distribution loss was estimated to be 15.0% of net generation. \nThese additional losses are partly technical and include overheating cables and transformers, \nbecause of the excessive current caused by the unplanned connection of new customers, and \nnon-implementation of planned improvements to the network because of financial constraints. A \nsmaller share of the losses is due to connections without meters, metering errors, and theft. The \nGovernment will accelerate improvements to those sections of the transmission and distribution \nnetwork where losses are high, and replace and upgrade the network to reduce losses, which \nwould also improve service quality in terms of voltage profile. The Government will also make a \nparallel  effort  to  upgrade  and  improve  the  meters  and  the  metering  system,  and  conduct \nsurveillance on theft. An investment of $87 million in the loss reduction program is planned, \nincluding $64 million for the medium- and low-voltage technical loss reduction program and  \n$23 million for the nontechnical loss reduction program. By these measures, the Government \nplans to reduce overall losses to 12% by 2016. The Government also plans to pilot innovative \noutsourcing projects with ADB assistance, particularly for nontechnical loss reductions in peri-\nurban and rural areas.  \n \n  5.  Rural Electrification \n \n16.  From its inception, CEB has been implementing rural electrification projects with equity \ninvestments  by  the  Government  and  with  internal  funds,  and  has  been  accelerating  rural \nelectrification since the 1980s. As of the end of 2005, 3.34 million housing units (70.8%) out of \n4.56 million had an active grid electricity connection (73.2% including inactive accounts).3 Most \n                                                 \n3  As of the end of 2005, the population was estimated 19,668,000, and the average household size was 4.31 \npersons. These figures excluded Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in the Northern Province. \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nhouseholds without access to electricity are in rural areas. The Government is committed to an \ninterim target of 90% of households by 2010 and an eventual target of 96% (88% on-grid and \n8% off-grid) by 2016.  \n \n17.  Off-Grid Electrification. While some areas can be electrified by closing the gaps in the \nexisting  network,  most  villages  yet  to  be  electrified  require  longer  medium-voltage  line \nextensions and long low-voltage distribution lines. The Government will identify such areas and \ninvest  in  off-grid  electricity  services  through  small  hydropower,  biomass,  and  wind-based \ngenerating  systems,  and  associated  distribution  lines,  as  well  as  stand-alone  solar  home \nsystems. About 300 such community-based village electrification systems currently provide \nelectricity to an estimated 10,000 houses. In addition, about 100,000 solar home systems have \nbeen installed. Investment support for such off-grid services has come from the Government \nthrough the provincial councils and the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development \nproject of the World Bank. \n \n18.  Rural Household Connection. Many households in suburban and rural areas remain \nunconnected as they cannot afford to pay connection charges, even though distribution feeders \nhave already reached their neighborhood. Traditionally, poor households have been a difficult \ngroup to target in the electrification campaigns because connections require initial capital that \nmay be beyond the means of many families. However, some of these households may be able \nto repay a loan or connection fee in monthly installments over 2\u20133 years. Reaching these \nhouseholds would bring two major benefits. First, the households themselves will enjoy the \nbenefits to be derived from having access to electricity. Second, CEB will have more customers, \ngenerating more income and enabling progress toward the electrification targets set by the \nGovernment. \n \n19.  In 2002, ADB approved a pilot project, the Power Fund for the Poor,4 which became \noperational in 2004. The project financed electricity connection costs for poorer households \nthrough a revolving fund administered by local microfinance institutions. As of the end of 2007, it \nhad electrified 10,400 poor rural households in over 400 villages in eight districts. With support \nfrom ADB, the Government will continue to provide a credit support program to rural households \nto build on the success of this pilot project.   \n \n  6.  Demand-Side Management \n \n20.  The SEA is mandated to develop and implement policies to reduce consumption and \nachieve better energy efficiency in residential, municipal and industrial end-user applications. \nThe Government has established a sustainable guarantee facility within SEA to facilitate access \nto  financing  for  energy  conservation  projects.  Eight  technology  priority  areas  have  been \nidentified by the Government for pilot demand-side and energy conservation projects. These \ninclude power factor correction in transmission networks and efficiency improvements in lighting \napplications  in  residential  and  commercial  buildings,  lighting  grids,  industrial  boilers,  air \nconditioning systems, compressed air systems, industrial motors and drives, fans and air blow \ninstallations,  and  municipal  water  and  irrigation  pumps  and  systems.  Combined  with  loss \nreduction  programs  in  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  these  initiatives  can  reduce \ndemand for imported fuels and mitigate environmental impacts associated with the increase in \ngreenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter emissions. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004. Proposed Grant Assistance to Sri Lanka for the Power Fund for the Poor. Manila (financed by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n21.  In Sri Lanka, end-user improvements have been largely price-driven. In the household \ncustomer group, the major intervention has been the promotion of compact fluorescent lamps \n(CFLs). A pilot program started in 1994\u20131995 followed by a large-scale program. Interest-free \nloans were available from CEB and LECO for the purchase of up to three CFLs. As a result, \nthere are now about 2 million CFLs in operation. However, this program has not been very \neffective since 2003 and the Government plans to relaunch it with a target of reaching about  \n4  million  in  operation.  Furthermore,  in  2001,  CEB  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Standards  Institute \nlaunched a scheme to label appliances based on their energy efficiency. The Government \nintroduced mandatory labeling in 2007 and plans to complete it by 2010. It will also update the \nEnergy Efficiency Building Code and to make it mandatory.     \n \n  7.  Debt Restructuring and Tariff Rationalization \n \n22.   Debt Restructuring. In 2005, the Treasury wrote off SLRs7.8 billion of CEB\u2019s deferred \ntax and other payment arrears and made direct payments of SLRs3.5 billion to the Ceylon \nPetroleum  Corporation  on  behalf  of  CEB.  The  restructuring  of  CEB\u2019s  long-term  debt  of  \nSLRs61 billion was approved by the Government in April 2006. Half of its long-term liabilities \nhave been converted to equity and half have been rescheduled, with repayment to begin only \nafter the commercial operations of the Puttalam coal-fired power plant have begun. This plant is \nexpected to lower CEB\u2019s generation cost substantially and hence to generate more cash debt \nservices.  \n \n23.  Tariff  Rationalization.  To  ensure  electricity  prices  reflect  the  cost  of  supply  and \nincrease revenues, the Government has started to rationalize the tariff structure so all recurrent \nexpenses of CEB can be met by the tariffs. In March 2008, the Government introduced a new \ntariff structure that increased average retail tariffs by about 30%. The new tariffs aim to raise \ntariffs for domestic consumers, which have been heavily cross-subsidized by commercial and \nindustrial consumers. However, the impact on \u201clifeline tariffs,\u201d considered necessary to maintain \nminimum living standards, has been minimized. The tariff revision has brought CEB close to an \noperational breakeven.  \n \n  8.  Private Sector Participation \n \n24.  The Government will continue to promote private sector participation in the power sector.  \nIt has recently opened a conventional hydropower project of less than 50 MW to private sector \ninvestment. Two hydropower projects, Moragolla (27 MW) and Ging Ganga (49 MW), are \nintended  for  private  sector  investment.  Of  the  planned  base  load  thermal  plants,  the \nHambantota coal-fired power plant is proposed to be an independent power producer and the \nTrincomalee  coal-fired  plant  is  proposed  to  be  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project.  The \nGovernment plans to rely on private sector investments for renewable energy development and \nhas introduced technology-specific subsidized tariffs to promote small hydropower, wind and \nbiomass generation. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  35 \nPREVIOUS ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nTO THE ENERGY SECTOR IN SRI LANKA \n \nA.

Background \n \n1.  Sri Lanka's generation capacity is projected to continue lagging behind the demand \nrequirements over the near to medium term. The planned enhancement of generation capacity \nwill be derived mainly from new coal-burning thermal facilities and, as a result, the share of \nclean energy in power generation will decrease. It is therefore crucial to mitigate the impacts \nassociated  with  this  substantial  enlargement  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  rapid \ndemand-side management to reduce end-user consumption and losses in transmission and \ndistribution networks.  \n  \n2.  Responsibility  for  street  lighting  traditionally  rests  with  local  authorities  such  as \nmunicipalities, town councils, and pradeshiya sabhas. Electricity bills are paid out of government \nsubsidies so municipalities have no incentive to reduce energy consumption. In addition, the \nGovernment has not been able to pay the full amount of subsidies, which has led to commercial \nlosses for CEB and LECO. In the case of CEB, the energy consumed by street lighting system \nis estimated at 150 GWh per year. Out of this, about 52 GWh are unaccounted for, adding an \nextra 0.57% to CEB system losses. To put an end to this vicious cycle, the Government has \ndecided to delegate responsibility for municipal street lighting to CEB and LECO, starting in \nselected urban areas.  \n \n3.  Under the project, CEB and LECO will establish internal units based on a utility energy \nservice  company  (ESCO)  model  to  undertake  the  street  lighting  operations  and  maximize \nenergy savings through demand-side management. The ESCO service market is still quite \nimmature in Sri Lanka, and requires further strengthening and support from external partners. \nThe  utility  ESCO  model  to  be  set  up  with  ADB  assistance  will  be  used  for  demand-side \nmanagement programs for municipal governments and other customers with capital constraints. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n3.  The energy savings from the project will help reduce the commercial losses of CEB and \nLECO. The outcomes will be (i) a reduction in energy consumption and related costs and \nimplementation of energy efficiency improvements in municipal street lighting systems, and (ii) \nfreed additional capacity and peak load stabilization within distribution networks in the program \nareas.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n4.  The project will support the implementation of pilot energy efficiency projects in the CEB \nand LECO service areas, and have the following outputs:  \n \n(i)  separation of street lighting feeders and installation of feeder meters; \n(ii)  replacement of old conductors and feeder controls; \n(iii)  replacement  of  incandescent  and  mercury  evaporation  lamps  with  compact \nfluorescent or sodium lamps to save energy and ensure longer performance (the \nlamps last five times longer than incandescent lamps); and \n(iv)  installation  of  time-of-day  switches  and  electronic  timers  to  cut  electricity \nconsumption during the daytime, eliminate overcharging, remove delays caused \nby manual switching of lamps, and ensure reliable operating schedules. \n ", "4  0  Appendix 6 \n \nD.  Cost Estimate and Financing Plan \n \n5.   The total investment cost will be $5 million. Of this, $4.2 million will be funded by two \nseparate grants (one of $2.2 million from the Climate Change Fund and the other of $2 million \nfrom the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility)1 and \n$0.8 million will be funded by the Government. In addition, $0.8 million will be funded under the \nClimate Change Fund (CCF) for associated technical assistance.     \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  The project will be implemented by CEB and LECO in their respective jurisdictions2 \nthrough a utility-based ESCO model. Management contracts for a demand-side management \nprogram on street lighting will be handled by ESCO units to be set up within CEB and LECO. \nThe realized energy savings will be deposited in the ESCOs\u2019 escrow accounts and used to \nfinance  further  energy  efficiency  projects.  This  will  ensure  that  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility funds are used to create a sustainable impact and to generate further \nenergy efficiency improvements. The CCF technical assistance will support CEB and LECO to \nestablish the ESCO units. CEB and LECO will collect data to determine baseline consumption, \ninstalling equipment, and monitoring the project performance in accordance with a verification \nand monitoring protocol to be developed under the technical assistance. Details of the technical \nassistance are in Appendix 10 and Supplementary E.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Allocation of the fund between CEB and LECO will decided by ADB based on project preparedness and progress \nby each agency.    \n2  As defined by CEB Act No. 17 of 1969 and the memorandum of associations of Lanka Electricity Company \n(Private) established in 1983 under the Companies Act. In power distribution, LECO supplies power to Colombo \nand other urban areas in the western and coastal belt while CEB covers the remaining part of the country.   \n ", "Appendix 7  41 \nPROJECT DESCRIPTION OF RURAL HOUSEHOLD CONNECTION PART \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  From  its  inception,  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB)  has  been  implementing  rural \nelectrification projects with equity investments by the Government and with internal funds, and \nhas been accelerating rural electrification since the 1980s. As of the end of 2005, 3.34 million \nhousing  units  (70.8%)  out  of  4.56  million  had  an  active  grid  electricity  connection  (73.2% \nincluding inactive accounts).1 Most households without access to electricity are in rural areas.  \n \n2  Even in rural villages that have already been electrified, a large number of households \nremain  unconnected  as  they  cannot  afford  to  pay  connection  charges.  Traditionally,  poor \nhouseholds  have  been  a  difficult  group  to  target  in  the  electrification  campaigns  because \nconnections require initial capital that may be beyond the means of many families. However, \nsome  of  these  households  may  be  able  to  repay  a  loan  or  a  connection  fee  in  monthly \ninstallments over 2\u20133 years. Reaching these households would bring two major benefits. First, \nthe  households  themselves  will  enjoy  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  having  access  to \nelectricity. Second, CEB will have more customers, generating more income, and enabling \nprogress toward the electrification targets set by the Government. \n \n3.  In 2002, ADB approved a pilot project, the Power Fund for the Poor.2 The project \nfinanced  the  electricity  connection  costs  for  poorer  households  through  a  revolving  fund \nadministered by local microfinance institutions. It has successfully electrified more than 10,000 \npoor households (1.2% of the total number of poor households in the country) while maintaining \na recovery ratio of more than 95%. The Government has asked ADB to build on this success \nwith an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan funding. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n4.  The  Project  will  help  to  (i)  improve  operational  and  financial  efficiency  in  rural \nelectrification,  and  (ii)  expand  coverage  of  rural  electrification  for  poverty  reduction.  The \noutcome of the project will be sustainable access to grid electricity by the rural population and a \nbetter service by CEB in rural areas. It is expected that at least 15,000 poor households will be \nconnected to the grid by 2010 and at least 60,000 households by 2016 (8% of the total number \nof poor households).  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n5.  In the Power Fund for the Poor (para. 3), microfinance institutions had a credit line \nbacked by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant, which enabled them to provide micro \ncredit to rural households to help them pay their service connection costs. Under this project, \nCEB will provide installment credit for poor households so they can pay their upfront service \nconnection costs. CEB will develop the credit program with ADB technical assistance. The \nprogram will be operated by service providers with an ADF loan of $3.5 million as a line of \ncredit.  \n \n                                                 \n1  As of the end of 2005, the population was estimated 19,668,000, and the average household size was 4.31 \npersons. These figures excluded Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in the Northern Province. \n2  ADB. 2004. Proposed Grant Assistance to Sri Lanka for the Power Fund for the Poor. Manila (financed by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n ", "42      Appendix 7  \n \n6.  ADB engaged a local nongovernment organization to evaluate the Power Fund for the \nPoor to incorporate its key success factors and lessons learned into the design of the current \nProject. The evaluation revealed that targeting an appropriate group of households is essential \nto ensuring outreach while minimizing credit loss. CEB plans to start the program in Hambantota \nand Ratnapura where it also has a grid extension program and where service providers can \neasily be found. It then plans to roll it out to other areas, including Ampara in the Eastern \nProvince. The following categories of household will eligible: \n \n(i)  households situated in a village that has been electrified for at least 12 months \nbefore the credit application, \n(ii)  households that are able to invest at least 20% of the total cost (connection and \nwiring), \n(iii)  households living in houses with the roof and walls made of permanent materials, \nand \n(iv)  households with unrestricted access to existing main grid line. \n \n7.  When a credit application is submitted to CEB from a household, a service provider will \nassess the household\u2019s repayment capacity and confirm that there are no technical difficulties in \nmaking the electricity connection. If the application is approved, CEB will provide a service \nconnection and the connection cost will be recoded as a loan to the customer in CEB\u2019s balance \nsheet. The loan will be recovered in installments over 24\u201336 months, together with payments for \nelectricity bills. An escrow account will be set up in CEB to receive installment payments. \n \n8.  The  funds  in  the  account  will  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  connection  for  new \ncustomers. Principal and interests on the loans to customers will be deposited to the account to \nprovide loans to new customers as well as to make repayments on the ADB loan. CEB will \nadminister the account, monitor loan recovery, and report to ADB regularly. Interest rates on the \ninstallments will be used to cover the cost of ADB loan, administration costs and a risk premium, \nbut CEB will not expect to make profit from this project. Detailed implementation arrangements \nand a fund-flow chart is provided in Figure A7.1. \n   \nD.  Cost Estimate and Financing Plan \n \n9.  An ADF loan of $3.5 million will be provided for CEB to establish a line of credit. The \nproject will require technical assistance of $2.5 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed by \nthe Japan Special Fund and $0.5 million by CEB.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  As CEB staff have little experience in the customer credit business, the management of \nthis credit program will be outsourced to service providers. This will include (i) awareness-\nbuilding among potential beneficiaries; (ii) identification of potential customers; (iii) assessment \nof  customers\u2019  payment  capabilities;  (iv)  processing  of  credit  applications;  and  (v)  credit \nadministration and recovery. There will be a performance-based contract between CEB and the \nservice providers, measured mainly by the recovery ratio. This means that part of the credit risk \nwill  be  passed  on  to  the  service  provider.  The  microfinance  institutions  that  have  been \nimplementing the Power Fund for the Poor are expected to be the service providers. CEB staff \nwill  work  with  them  and  provide  technical  assessments,  cost  estimates,  and  service \nconnections. ADB TA will support CEB in detailed project design, preparation of a performance-\nbased contract, selection of service providers and capacity building of stakeholders. Details of \nthe technical assistance are in Appendix 10 and Supplementary E.  \n ", "Appendix 7  43 \n \n11.  CEB will report to ADB quarterly on (i) the status of the escrow account (until the full loan \namount  is  disbursed);  (ii)  overall  portfolio  performance,  including  a  minimum  cumulative \nprincipal collection, a minimum annual principal and interest collection, a maximum portfolio \ninfection, and data on connected households); and (iii) the status of the processing of credit \napplications. If requested by ADB, CEB will provide ADB with certification that the ADB funds \nhave been used to provide service connections and that those who received credit have been \nphysically connected.  \n \nFigure A7.1: Implementation Arrangements for Rural Household Connection \n(Loan + Technical Assistance Grant) \nADB\nTechnical \nLoan\nAssistance Grant\nRepayment\nGOSL\nRepayment\nProject \nContract + Pay service fee\nConsulting \nCEB Support select service providers\nFirm\nProvide trainings\nCEB Area \nOffices\nService \nProvide technical assessment  Providers\nand instruction Repayment of installments \nProvide service connection monthly with interest rates Beneficiary identification\nConnection cost estimate\nAwareness raising\nCredit administration\nBenefit monitoring \nHouseholds Poverty impact assessment\n \n \nSources: ADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board, GOSL = Government of Sri Lanka. \n ", " \n \n4\n  4\n \nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 A\nDescription J J A S O N D J F M A  M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J pp\ne\nSystem Control Modernization Defect Liability Period (1 year) nd\nEOI RFP CAM ix\nConsulting Services  8\n(Project Implementation Support)  \nTF CACW C\nCPU & SCADA System\nTF CACW C\nTelecommunication System\nTransmission System Strengthening\nTF CACW C\nGrid Substation\nTF CACW C\nTransmission Line\nDistribution Substations Augmentation\nTF CACW C\nSubstation\nDemand Side Management\nTF CACW C\nStreet Lighting\nNetwork Capacity Augmentation for Renewable Energy Projects\nTF C\nGrid Substation\nTF CACW C\nTransmission Line\nTransmission System Strengthening in the Eastern Province\nTF CACW C\nGrid Substation\nTF CACW C\nTransmission Line\nRural Household Connection\nFirst Generation Loans\nEOI = Expression of Interest,  RFP = Request For Proposal,  M = Mobilization,  TF = Tender Float,  CA = Contract Award,  CW = Commencement of Work,  C = Commissioning\nSource: Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electricity Company.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9    45\nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nA.

The power supply industry in Sri Lanka is vertically integrated and is owned primarily by \nthe Government with the exception of a few generating stations owned and operated by private \ncompanies. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the national utility. It owns and is responsible for \nthe generation, transmission, and approximately 90% of the distribution of electrical power in Sri \nLanka. Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) was formed as a distribution company under the \nCompanies Act and most of its shares are owned by CEB and the Government.  Municipal \nauthorities are minority shareholders  \n \n2.  The CEB transmission system comprises a 220 kV and 132 kV transmission network \nconnected to grid substations and power stations. However, underinvestment and delayed \ninvestments  are  causing  severe  constraints  on  the  operation,  reliability,  and  quality  of  the \nelectricity supply. Development and strengthening of the primary transmission and associated \ngrid substation facilities are essential to meet the suppressed and growing electricity demand.  \n \n3.  The  proposed  transmission  system  investments  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy and provide a least-cost intervention to improve physical infrastructure.1 \nElectricity is a prerequisite for GDP growth as well as for rural and urban development, and an \nadequate power supply is essential for increasing private sector investment in industry and \ncommerce, and for promoting agro-industrial activity and off-farm employment. The importance \nof improving the efficiency of the electricity system has been heightened by the rapid rise in \nworld fuel prices over the past 5 years. These have affected Sri Lanka badly as over 58% of its \npower  supply  comes  from  relatively  small,  high-cost,  diesel-fired  generating  plants.  By \nupgrading the transmission system, removing bottlenecks, and improving system efficiency, the \nproposed investments can contribute the government\u2019s efforts to provide better services at an \naffordable price. As electricity transmission is a natural monopoly under the direction of CEB, a \npublic sector intervention to fund the needed investments is justifiable. \n \n4.  An economic analysis was undertaken for the investment components. The analysis \nsought to determine and verify: \n(i)  electricity demand and supply projections;  \n(ii) that the proposed subprojects are part of the national least cost expansion program; \n(iii) economic cost benefit analysis including sensitivities to key variables; and \n(iv) distribution of costs and benefits amongst stakeholders.  \n \n5.  Economic benefits will accrue from the cost savings resulting from displacing more \nexpensive sources of energy due to the system improvements, and incremental benefits from \ngreater electricity consumption.  \n \nB.  Demand Forecast \n \n6.  Overall annual electricity demand grew from 823 GWh in 1972 to 5,416 GWh in 2000, \nrepresenting an annual compound growth rate of about 7%. Since then it has grown at about \n8% per annum to the current 8,458 GWh.2 CEB prepared a national power and energy demand \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2011): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n2 CEB data as of the end of 2007. \n ", "  Appendix 11    51\nforecast for 2006\u20132026, which formed the basis for preparing specific grid substation demand \nforecasts used to identify the basic grid substation capacity enhancement requirements. As the \ndemand for electricity in Sri Lanka is increasing by 8%\u20139% per annum, the primary transmission \nand associated grid substation facilities have to be enhanced and strengthened. \n \nC.  Least-Cost Planning \n \n7.  CEB\u2019s long-term transmission development plan for 2006\u20132015 identified the upgrades \nthat were needed, using load flow studies, reliability studies, short circuit calculations, and \nstability  studies,  carried  out  using  the  power  system  simulator  for  engineering.  Several \nengineering options to improve the network were proposed. These were evaluated from a cost \nperspective and for economic viability. Economically viable proposals were then selected for the \nCEB expansion and upgrade plan.   \n \nD.  Project Costs \n \n8.  All  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  2009  prices.  The  domestic  price \nnumeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent value and \nwere converted to domestic equivalents using an estimated standard exchange rate factor of \n1.02. Capital costs included physical contingencies, but excluded taxes, price contingencies and \nfinancial charges during construction. \n \nE.  Project Benefits \n  \n9.  The Project\u2019s investment outputs can be categorized into three groups, with the first \ngroup  enjoying  slightly  different  economic  benefits:  (i)  system  upgrades,  including  the \naugmentation  and  construction  of  grid  substations  and  transformer  capacity  enhancement; \n(ii) construction of new transmission lines; and (iii) construction of the new system control \ncenter. \n \n10.  The  primary  benefit  of  grid  substation  augmentations  and  transformer  capacity \nenhancements  are  the  reduction  in  unserved  demand.  This  demand  will  now  be  met  by \nincreasing the transmission capacity by eliminating transmission bottlenecks from the existing \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario, and by enabling the grid to accommodate the anticipated demand \ngrowth  over  time.  This  incremental  power  supply  is  valued  using  consumers\u2019  estimated \nwillingness to pay for incremental consumption. \n \n11.  The primary benefit from the new transmission lines is the power flow improvements, \nand the resulting elimination of diesel-fired power generation that is required in the \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d scenario. The need for small, local diesel generators for voltage correction in the \nrespective transmission constrained areas will be eliminated by the construction of new lines, \nwhich will allow grid power to flow into these areas. This produces a resource cost saving for \nCEB when grid-supplied power costs are compared with the higher-priced, small-scale, diesel-\nfired generation that they will replace. As with the new system control center, this represents a \nnon-incremental output of electricity to consumers, and is valued as a resource cost savings \nthat accrues if these transmission lines are built. CEB estimates the marginal cost of these \ncaptive diesel plants to be SLRs18.65/kWh. Another benefit of these new transmission lines is \nthat they will be able to handle the anticipated load growth on CEB\u2019s system. However, this \nbenefit cannot be valued on its own; it will have to be considered as part of CEB\u2019s long-term \nintegrated  power  system  expansion  program,  encompassing  generation,  transmission  and \n   ", "52   Appendix 11 \ndistribution. For this Project\u2019s economic evaluation, only the immediate, resource cost savings \nwere quantified, thus producing conservative results. \n \n12.  The primary benefit of the new system control center will be increased system efficiency \nand reduced transmission network losses. The new control center will enable proper system \nmanagement, and voltage and reactive power optimization. To value these benefits, the quantity \nof extra power that would have had to be generated to make up system inefficiencies and \nnetwork  losses  results  in  non-incremental  electricity  consumption  from  the  consumers\u2019 \nperspective. Its value represents the resource cost savings that would accrue if this subproject \nwere to proceed and is valued at the avoided cost of generation. The second calculated benefit \nis from incremental power sales due to reduced system outages and reduced restoration times \nwhen outages occur. However, this benefit is very small compared with the resource cost \nsavings (about 0.3% of total calculated benefits). \n  \n13.  The cost of electricity in Sri Lanka is very high because of dependence on diesel-fired \nbase load generation and oil price increases. In such a high-cost environment, resource cost \nsavings  produce  high  upfront  economic  benefits.  It  is  projected  that  the  average  cost  of \nelectricity will decrease over time, as the planned addition of coal-fired generation will lower \naverage system costs.3 In the economic analysis, high upfront resource cost savings decrease \nover time. \n \nF.  Estimation of Willingness to Pay \n \n14.  The  estimation  of  willingness  to  pay  used  the  methodology  outlined  in  the  ADB \nEconomics  and  Research  Department\u2019s  technical  note  Measuring  Willingness  to  Pay  for \nElectricity.4 The economic benefits of electricity consumption are based on the alternative costs \nof energy used in the absence of grid-supplied electricity. Estimates of these benefits require \ntheoretical  demand  curves  for  electricity  use  by  various  consumer  categories.  Taking  into \naccount  the  value  of  alternative  fuel  sources  to  satisfy  suppressed  demand,  in  the  rural \ndomestic context, the cost of kerosene illumination was used. In the commercial and industrial \ncontext, the cost of diesel generators was used.  \n \n15.  Two methods were employed to estimate willingness to pay (further detail is available in \nSupplementary Appendix F). First, demand functions relating energy price to energy demand \nwere  estimated  for  each  of  the  three  main  consumer  groups  in  Sri  Lanka  (domestic, \ncommercial, and industrial).5 Average price and consumption data for the past 5 years were \nadjusted for income and inflation to arrive at a common 2009 base. Consumption data were \nscaled for estimated suppressed demand.6  Regression analysis was used on the data points to \nderive  the  three  demand  functions.  Solving  the  demand  functions  for  the  increase  in \nconsumption per consumer enabled by the investments gives willingness to pay for additional \nunits  of  consumption  of  SLRs21.51/kWh  (domestic  consumers),  SLRs18/kWh  (commercial \nconsumers) and SLRs16.34/kWh (industrial consumers), with a weighted average value based \non power usage of SLRs18.9/kWh. However, as this regression analysis used a limited number \nof years of data, alternative approaches are recommended and their results compared. Second, \n                                                 \n3  The average cost of electricity, at over SLRs13/kwh, is projected to decrease by about 50% over 10 years. \n4  Choynowski, Peter. 2002. Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity. Manila: ADB (Economics and Research \nDepartment Technical Note Series No. 3). \n5  The category of street lighting was not included. As this segment accounts for only 1.5% of electricity consumption, \nthis elimination is considered valid. \n6  As the full amount is difficult to quantify, a conservative estimate for suppressed demand of 2% was used. \n ", "  Appendix 11    53\nsurvey information was taken from two previous ADB-funded studies.7 Sri Lanka\u2019s national \nelectrification ratio as of 2005 was 75%. Substantial disparities in access to electricity still exist, \nwith rural areas having the least amount of electrification. For rural customers, the alternative to \ngrid-supplied electricity is kerosene. Average kerosene usage in non-electrified villages was \n12.5  kWh  equivalent  of  kerosene  per  month,  while  average  electricity  usage  in  electrified \nvillages was 41 kWh per month. Using the price for kerosene and the domestic electricity tariff, \nand the functional form for the demand for electricity of ln qe = \u03b1 + \u03b2pe, the economic benefit of \nincremental  consumption  is  SLRs22.74/kWh.  This  value  was  applied  to  all  residential \nconsumers. For nonresidential consumers, the alternative is the use of diesel generators. In an \nearlier ADB-funded study, 92% of sampled industries had backup unit generating facilities to \nsatisfy their full or partial demand for power at a higher cost than grid-based power.8 To be \nconservative,  it  was  assumed  that  only  the  variable  costs  of  diesel  generators  would  be \ndisplaced; in other words, it was assumed that there would not be any avoidance of capital \ncosts for diesel generators. Marginal costs of diesel generators were based on an estimated \nborder price equivalent value of diesel of SLRs80.0 per liter, specific consumption of 0.25 \nliters/kWh, and non-fuel operation and maintenance of SLRs0.6/kWh. This gave a total variable \ncost of SLRs20.6/kWh. Using this cost versus the marginal average electricity tariff of SLRs12, \nas well as quantities of power for commercial and industrial users based on CEB data, and \nusing the functional form for the demand for electricity, the benefit of incremental consumption is \nSLRs14.39/kWh, with a weighed average value of SLRs18.0/kWh. Using the two weighted \naverage values from the regression and survey methods of 18.9 and 18.0 respectively, the \naverage of these, SLRs18.45 /kWh is used in this economic analysis. Further detail is provided \nin Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nG.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n16.  A period of 30 years was used for economic evaluation, reflecting the economic lives of \nthe investment components. Investment is assumed to take place in the period 2009\u20132011, and \nbenefits are assumed to be realized from 2010. The incremental costs and benefits of the \ninvestment  components  were  estimated  by  comparing  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-project\u201d \nscenarios. Detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that overall the subprojects are expected to \ndeliver significant economic benefits. The combined economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \nestimated to be 16.0%. The EIRR results are shown in Table A11.1.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n17.  The risks of the project not achieving the above EIRR were identified from both the cost \nand the benefit side. Cost-side risks include increases in capital and operating costs, as well as \ncompletion delays. On the benefit side, consumers\u2019 willingness to pay is derived from forecasts \nof their electricity demands in the coming years. If Sri Lanka experiences significantly lower \neconomic growth, this will dampen the demand for electricity and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay \n ", "  Appendix 11    55\nand the program benefits will be lower. Resource cost savings may also be lower if the process \nof reducing currently high electricity costs occurs faster than projected. \n \n18.  For each of the risks identified, the sensitivity of the EIRR was tested (Table A11.2).  \n \nTable A11.2: EIRR Sensitivity Analyses (%) \nSensitivity Analyses  EIRR  Switching Value \nBase Case                                     Variation  16.0   \nCapital Costs    +10  14.7  +39 \nOperating Costs    +10  15.8  +245 \nTotal Benefits    \u201310  14.5  \u201325 \nAll the above    13.2   \nWTP Reduction  \u201310  10.3  \u20137.1 \nTwo-year delay    13.2   \nTwo-year delay plus 10% increase capital cost 12.3   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, WTP = willingness to pay. \n                    Source: Asian development Bank estimates. \n \nI.  Distribution Analysis \n \n19.  The distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders was assessed by comparing \nfinancial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits. Constant price financial cash flows \nfrom the investment program were estimated and discounted at 12% to estimate present values \nof cost and benefit streams. Constant price economic cost and benefit streams were also \ndiscounted  at  12%,  and  the  differences  between  financial  and  economic  present  values, \nrepresenting gains and losses to stakeholders, were calculated. Analysis was undertaken on a \nprefinancing basis, so lenders were not included as stakeholders. Income tax was excluded \nfrom the analysis. \n \n20.  Overall, the economic net present value exceeds the financial net present value by \nSLRs9.46 billion,  with  the  vast  majority  of  this  benefit  (SLRs9.43  billion)  split between  the \nbenefit to consumers in the form of consumer surplus, and benefits to CEB in resource cost \nsavings, which in turn is shared with consumers in the long run in the form of lower tariffs.  \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n \n21.  The economic analysis confirms that the proposed investments are part of the least-cost \nsystem  upgrade  plan  for  Sri  Lanka  and  are  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.  From  an  economic \nperspective, the proposed Project is justified. \n \n   ", "56   Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.    Methodology and Major Assumptions \n \n1.  The financial analysis of the investment components was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 All financial costs and benefits are \nexpressed in constant 2008 prices. Cost streams were used to determine financial internal rates \nof return (FIRR), i.e., capital investment and operation and maintenance costs reflect the costs \nof delivering the estimated benefits. The tariff rates used for incremental energy sales that were \nused to estimate the financial benefits reflect the tariff increases announced in February 2008 \nand effective 15 March 2008 (although the full tariff used in the estimation is lower than the \nannounced rate in case the new tariffs are only partially implemented). The weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC) of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was calculated for the proposed \nProject and compared with the project component FIRRs to ascertain the financial viability of the \nsubproject investments. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying \nassumptions was also assessed. Based on this analysis, it is concluded that the Project is \nfinancially viable.  \n \n2.  Capital  costs  include  all  civil  works,  equipment,  construction,  and  installation  costs \nassociated  with  each  investment,  as  well  as  any  applicable  taxes,  duties  and  physical \ncontingencies. Ongoing operations and maintenance cost assumptions are commensurate with \nestablished  norms  for  transmission  system  facilities  of  this  nature.  Financial  viability  was \nexamined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \u201cwith-project\u201d and \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d scenarios. The incremental benefits of the substation augmentation and construction \ncomponents are based on additional revenues earned by CEB from the sale of additional power \nto consumers as a result of the elimination of transmission system bottlenecks. These revenues \nare valued at the applicable tariff versus the cost of supply, adjusted for system losses. The new \ntransmission lines eliminate the need to run small-scale, localized diesel plants for voltage \ncorrection and grid stability in areas that previously lacked transmission lines, resulting in cost \nsavings. The new system control center also enables resource cost savings from lower system \nlosses, fewer outages, and reduced restoration time after outages. It is assumed that the \ninvestment components will have 30-year economic lives.   \n \n3.  CEB\u2019s tariff rates are divided into domestic, religious purpose, commercial, and industrial \nrates  per  unit.  The  domestic  and  religious  purpose  rates  are  specified  for  each  block  of \nconsumption level, increase progressively, and are accompanied by a fixed monthly charge. \nThe commercial and industrial rates contain per-unit as well as fixed charges based on voltage \nsupply levels, and some industrial customers can opt to pay peak and off-peak rates. The \nexisting  tariff  (applicable  from  1  February  2007)  contains  a  20% fuel  charge for  domestic \nconsumers using more than 90 units per month and commercial consumers, religious purpose \nand industrial consumers were exempted). In 2007, the weighted average tariff per unit of \nelectricity sold, including the fixed charges and based on the distribution of customers, was \nSLRs10.53/kWh. As LECO makes bulk power purchases from CEB and passes through the \npurchase  costs  to  its  customers,  the  weighted  average  LECO  tariff  was  slightly  higher  at \nSLRs12.77/kWh for 2007. Under the proposed new tariff, the rates, including monthly fixed \ncharges, have increased for certain categories of consumers, such as domestic consumers \nconsuming power in excess of 360 units per month and commercial consumers (e.g., hotels). In \naddition, as CEB no longer receives subsidized fuel from Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for \npower  generation,  CEB  will  impose  a  20%  fuel  adjustment  charge  on  all  categories  of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The tariff rates used in the analysis are from CEB\u2019s proposed changes to the tariff \nschedule announced in February 2008.2  \n \nB.  Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  \n \n4.  To compute the WACC, it is assumed that the financing sources would be Government \nequity contributions and foreign loans. The cost of CEB\u2019s equity is calculated at 25%.3 The \nWACC is usually calculated on a post tax basis with taxes at 32.5% of net profits; however, \nbecause of the tax position of CEB, the loan portion was not tax adjusted in  computing this \nWACC. The other assumptions are a domestic inflation rate of 13%4 and an international \ninflation rate of 0.8% (Table A12.1).  \n \nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (%) \nSource  ADB Loan  Equity  Total \nAmount ($ million)  123.8  55.6  179.5 \nWeighting  69.0  31.0  100.0 \nNominal Cost  6.0  25.0    \nTax Rate  0.0a  0.0    \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost  6.0  25.0    \nInflation Rate  0.8  13.0    \nReal Cost   5.2  10.6    \nWeighted  WACC  3.6  3.3  6.9 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na The loan portion was not adjusted because CEB does not pay tax. \n \nC.  Calculation FIRR, Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses \n \n5.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated at 8.5% for the overall project \ncomponents  (Table  A12.2).  This  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated  WACC  of  6.9%, \nsubstantiating the financial viability of the Project.   \n \n                                                 \n2 Ceylon Electricity Board. 2008.

Risk Assessment  \n  \n6.  External Risks. Regulatory or tariff revision must be considered a risk as tariffs have \ntraditionally not reflected the full cost of supply and implementation of the new proposed rates \nhas not yet begun. Demand risk is minimal since considerable suppressed demand exists in Sri \nLanka and the incremental capacity made available by these investments is small compared \nwith the growth in supply arising from power generation projects. Geopolitical and political risks \n ", "  Appendix 12    59\nare present for all projects in Sri Lanka. However, the investments take place in numerous \nlocations and there is an overall shortage of power in Sri Lanka, both of which help to diversify \nthis risk. Therefore, the overall risk to the financial sustainability of CEB is deemed to be \nmanageable, provided the proposed tariff increase takes place. \n \n7.  Project-Specific Risks. Financial risks at subproject level include (i) an increase in the \nprice of civil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to have \naccess to necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered to be low for three reasons. \nFirst, the cost estimates were based on recent tenders received. Advanced procurement will \nreduce the time between loan effectiveness and disbursement. Second, CEB\u2019s implementation \ncapacity is sufficient for these types of investments and further support will be provided under \nthe  capacity  development  component.  Third,  CEB\u2019s  financial  projections  demonstrate \nsatisfactory cash flows throughout the forecast period to meet the repayment of debt associated \nwith the investments, once the investment components are commissioned. \n \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis  \n  \n8.  Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial \nnet  present  value  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables.  The  variables  considered  for  the \nsensitivity analyses were: a 10% increase in capital costs, a 10% increase in operation and \nmaintenance (O&M costs, and a 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs). Project-specific \ntests include a 2-year implementation delay with a 20% increase in costs.  \n \n9.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government of Sri Lanka has been investing for decades in human development, including health care and education. \nInvestments in rural electrification, distribution, and the transmission system enhancements will improve living standards, \nparticularly of the poor. This project will support the Government\u2019s social and economic development efforts. \n \nIn particular, the Project is expected to increase transmission and distribution capacity. It will lead to an affordable and reliable \npower supply, improve energy efficiency and provide more access to electricity for the poor for sustained and inclusive \neconomic growth. It will (i) help bring 200 MW clean energy sources on grid by removing transmission bottlenecks; \n(ii) maintaining system reliability to ensure a stable power supply; (iii) improve  energy efficiency through an innovative \nbusiness  model  including  public\u2013private  partnership;  (iv)  improve  sector  governance  by  strengthening  the  regulatory \nframework and supporting internal reforms of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) (v) promote power supply for poor rural \nhouseholds; and (vi) contribute to development of conflict-affected areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                    Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nAlthough this project is not designed to be a targeted intervention, a number of key elements will ensure it has positive \nimpacts on poverty. The distribution substation in Colombo will increase the power reliability, from which both public \nconsumers (such as social services) and private consumers (households and businesses) will benefit.  \n \nTransmission system enhancement will also have positive impacts, since some important areas will be now reached by the \nnational grid, particularly the Eastern Province and Pallekelle industrial district. In the first case, the Government is expecting \nthat the improvement of the power supply to the Eastern Province will have reduce poverty and support investments. In \nPallekelle the connection to the grid will increase the productivity of the existing factories (which have been relying on \ngenerators) and will boost the investments in new factories. In both cases jobs will be created. In addition to the facilities \nmade  available  to  small-scale  industries,  Medium-sized  and  large  industries  can  also  benefit  from  the  availability  of \nsubstations and spur medium voltage lines. This will open up opportunities for villages to sell ancillary services to industries. \n \nFinally, the Asian Development Fund (ADF) component will support CEB to provide connections to poor households in rural \nSri Lanka. The pilot program will be implemented first in three of the poorest districts: Hambantota, Ratnapura, and the East. \nHouseholds will be more productive, employment will be created, home garden cultivation will be increased through the use of \ndomestic water pumps, and backyard farms and small cottage industries will benefit.  \n \nThis component is expected to improve the living standards of poor households, by improving health conditions, reducing \nexpenditure on power (on-grid electricity is cheaper and more reliable than kerosene), increasing their productivity and \nincome, and increasing the number of hours children can study at night. \n \nNon-electrified households in Sri Lanka use kerosene oil for domestic lighting so electrification will lead to savings in the use \nof imported fuel.  \n \nI.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis  \nGenerally, Sri Lanka enjoys social indicators that are higher than those in other countries of similar economic status. It has a \nhigh literacy rate, high life expectancy at birth and low child mortality. These achievements are due to efforts to provide  vital \nbasic needs in the villages. The extension of electricity will eventually contribute greatly to raising the social indicators.  \n \nNonetheless, social development has been uneven throughout the country. In designing the ADF component (connection for \nthe poor) selection was made at three different levels.  \n \nTarget Districts.  Based on poverty indicators, national policy on rural electrification, and ADB\u2019s focus on Eastern Province, \nthe three districts of Ampara, Hambantota and Ratnapura have been short-listed for the initial round of the project. Other \n ", "  Appendix 13    61\ndistricts could enter the project following recommendations based on project evaluations. All three districts were short listed \non the basis of poverty. The national policy on rural electrification is committed to providing 100% access in the two districts of \nHambantota and Ratnapura. \n \nTargeting Divisional Secretary Divisions and Electricity Schemes: Unlike the pilot Power Fund for the Poor, the scheme \nwill be open to both existing and new electrification schemes. To increase the probability of the most deserving households \nreceiving the benefits of this funding, the project will give priority to divisional secretary divisions with poverty rates higher than \nthe overall district average rate, but other divisional secretary divisions may also be serviced. However for all divisional \nsecretary divisions and existing and new schemes, the criteria of a 12-month time gap should be applied for loan financed \nconnections. This is in line with the rationale of targeting used in the pilot Power Fund for the Poor. \n \nTargeting Households. As in the pilot Power Fund for the Poor, the definition of a poor household will be households unable \nto afford the capital outlay needed to obtain electricity. Within this target group, the ability to service a loan while meeting the \nelectricity bill will be a critical qualifying criterion. Deciding on the credit worthiness of the potential borrower will be the \nresponsibility of the service providers. The basic technical criteria set down by the CEB for a housing structure to qualify for \nmain grid electricity will apply here as well. \n \nThe Project\u2019s main social impacts will be the possible loss of crops due to the construction of towers and the stringing of \ntransmission lines. These will be  minimized through careful planning and scheduling of the activities and related civil works. \nAdditional compensation, whenever needed, will be awarded to vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, households \nheaded by women, and poor households. \nB.  Consultation and participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAffected communities have been consulted from the beginning to minimize or avoid impacts. The corridor  of the proposed \ntransmission lines has been identified in consultation with the communities and the affected people. Their concerns have \nbeen taken into consideration throughout the process. Communities and affected persons will continue to be consulted during \nthe entire implementation of the project to ensure that most civil works will be scheduled to avoid disruption of the crops. \n \nConsultations have also been carried out with the implementing agencies of the Power for the Poor project, as well as with \nother NGOs and financial agencies. The object has been to design the ADF component in the most efficient way, learning \nform the Power Fund for the Poor experience. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.).

Introduction \n \n1.  This resettlement and compensation plan covers parts 2, 3, 6 and 7 of the Project as \nother parts will not have any adverse social impact. Parts 2, 3, 6 and 7 include the augmentation \nof  15  grid  substations,  construction  of  four  new  substations,  and  construction of  five  new \ntransmission lines over new rights-of-way. \n \n2.  Augmentation  of  15  Substations.  All  15  substations  to  be  augmented  under  this \nproject would use land owned by CEB.  \n \n3.  Construction  of  Four  New  Substations.  In  selecting  land  for  new  substations,  a \nnumber of optional sites were reviewed for each substation. To minimize the resettlement \nimpacts, preference was always given to government-owned lands to avoid resettlement of \nprivate dwellings and impacts on land use. Particular attention is given to the convenience of \naccess to a transmission corridor.  \n \n4.  Construction of Five New Transmission Lines. This resettlement and compensation \nplan first explains the process of selecting the new rights-of-way for transmission lines.  Initially, \na number of map-based routing options were considered for each new line, with the primary \nfocus on avoiding or minimizing  impacts on human settlements or built up areas, forest and wild \nlife reserves, places of cultural or historical importance, social infrastructure (e.g., playgrounds, \nschools, or hospitals), and areas with trees. As a result of this careful selection of line routes, \nand  the  subsequent  public  consultation  and  the  appeal  procedure,  the  National  Grid \nDevelopment Project is not expected to cause any involuntary relocation of persons from their \ndwellings. CEB will ensure that maximum efforts will be made to avoid involuntary relocation, \neven if unforeseen events occur.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n5.  The rest of this appendix examines only the land use effects of the five new transmission \nline corridors to be developed under this Project. The width of the corridor for all 132 kV lines is \n27 meters (13.5 m on each side). Table A14.1 shows the summary resettlement and land-use \nimpacts of each transmission line corridor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "64   Appendix 14   \nTable A14.1: Project Impacts \nPermanent Land  Private  Total Affected \nAcquisition (ha)  Affected  Temporary  trees  Blocks of  Total \nGovernment  Households  Affected  to be  Lands   Affected \nSubproject Element   Private  Land   (Permanent)  Area (ha)  cut  (Temporary)  Households \nNew System Control  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nCentre \n           \nNetwork Capacity Augmentation for           \nRenewable Energy Project \nGrid Substations to               \nbe augmented \n1 1.

Policy Framework \n \n6.  The  Project  will  follow  both  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the \nrelevant Sri Lankan laws and policies. Until 2001, project-related resettlement issues were \nguided by Land Acquisition Act, 1950, as amended from time to time.  However, as this did not \nhave adequate provisions for the full social and economic rehabilitation of the people to be \nresettled, Sri Lanka has adopted a National Involuntary Resettlement Policy (NIRP), which \nrequires a resettlement plan to be included in the approval process if a project affects more than \n20 families.1  The policy assigns the overall responsibility for its implementation to the Ministry of \nLand  Development,  with  the  project-approving  agencies  and  the  Central  Environmental \nAuthority also being assigned responsibilities for evaluation and implementation. \n \n7.  In addition to the NIRP, a cabinet decision in 2006 (amended in 2007) covered payment \nof compensation for families affected by land acquisition for power sector development projects \nand works connected with electrical undertakings. No involuntary resettlement is foreseen in this \nproject, but, in case any involuntary resettlement becomes unavoidable, compensation will be \npaid in accordance with the NIRP and the cabinet decision. \n \n8.  A comparison between the Sri Lanka Acts and Regulations, the NIRP, and the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is provided in Table A14.2.  \n \nTable A14.2: Comparison of Sri Lanka Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB Policy \nPolicy Element  Sri Lanka  ADB  Comments \n1.
