It is also experiencing a rapid influx of business and tourism as the country opens as \nan  appealing  new  destination  for  investment  and  attractions.  However,  the  steady  increase  of \ninternational  visitors  is  currently  overwhelming  Yangon,  the  country\u2019s  largest  commercial  city \nand transit hub, due to the surge in demand for basic tourism and business infrastructure such \nas  hotel  rooms,  long-term  accommodation,  and  office  space.  Chronic  underinvestment  in \ntourism and business infrastructure has left the city with an inadequate and insufficient supply of \nworking and living spaces. The severe shortage of basic infrastructure in Yangon is a growing \nimpediment to economic growth, job creation, and foreign investment. The country requires an \nestimated $146 billion in urban infrastructure investment for its large cities during 2010\u20132030; of \nthis, almost 60% is required for residential housing ($87 billion) and more than 10% ($17 billion) \nfor commercial space.2 \n \n3. \nThe  project  comprises  the  revitalization  of  an  emerging  central  business  district, \nincluding  hotel,  retail,  office,  and  residential  space;  and  a  district  cooling  plant  and  network  to \nserve the locality. The overall development will also restore and preserve a prominent heritage \nbuilding  that  will  become  a  significant  feature  of  the  project  site.3 The  project  will  be  the  first \nproject finance transaction under the new Foreign Investment Law, and is identified by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  as  a  priority  to  help \nreduce the acute supply shortage in Yangon, stimulate business and tourism activity, and set a \nprecedent for international standards in the sector. The commercial lending market in Myanmar \nis at a nascent stage as local and international banks are unable to finance large and complex \nprojects  without  multilateral  assistance.  This  project  places  ADB  and  IFC  at  the  forefront  of \nundertaking  the  first  international  project  financing  in  Myanmar  under  the  new  foreign \ninvestment law. The project\u2019s demonstration effects will help commercial banks gain confidence \nin  the  Myanmar  market  and  set  a  blueprint  for  financiers  to  replicate  and  advance  similar \ndevelopments.  Because Yangon  is  a  crucial  engine for generating  economic  growth  and jobs, \nthe  development  of  a  competitive,  equitable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  city  through \nprojects such as this one is a strategic priority for the country.  \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   McKinsey Global Institute. 2013. Myanmar\u2019s Moment: Unique Opportunities, Major Challenges. New York.  \n3   Cultural  and  historic  heritage  sites  are  often  at  risk  during  rapid  and  unplanned  economic  expansion.  Yangon\u2019s \ninvaluable heritage buildings are at risk from long decades of neglect and, more pressingly, now from a new wave \nof commercial development that threatens century-old buildings in the downtown area that are being demolished \nwith  alarming  speed.  The  overall  development  includes  the  restoration  and  adaptive  reuse  of  the  former \nheadquarters  of  the  British  Burma  Railway  Company,  a  Victorian  building  built  in  1877  that  is  currently  in  a \ndilapidated state. While the restoration will not be part of the ADB and IFC investment and financing, it will be an \nintegral  part  of  the  project  site  and  an  important  element  through  shared  infrastructure  and  synergies  with  the \nproject.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  concentration  of  business  and  tourism  activity  in  Yangon  will  put  increasing \n4. \npressure on public utilities and the environment. Yangon has a hot tropical monsoon climate in \nwhich  daytime  temperatures  hover  around  30\u00b0C.  Accordingly,  air  conditioning  is  an  expensive \nnecessity  for  businesses  and  tourism,  and  accounts  for  a  significant  percentage  of  electricity \nconsumption,  especially  during  peak  periods.  The project  will  include the  country\u2019s first  district \ncooling  plant,  which  will  provide  sustainable,  efficient,  reliable,  and  essential  cooling  services. \nThe  plant  will  use  state-of-the-art technology  to  significantly  reduce  electricity  consumption for \ncooling  compared  with  conventional  air  conditioning.  The  plant  will  help  reduce  the  strain  on \nYangon\u2019s  electrical  grid,  reduce  power  plant  fuel  consumption,  provide  cost  savings  to  end-\nusers, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n5. \nMee Ya Hta International Hotel (MIHL) will be the counterparty under the master lease \nwith  MRT.

The borrower has prepared an \n21. \ninitial environmental examination to cover all aspects of the project following the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009). The  initial  environmental  examination  includes an environmental  and \nsocial  management  plan  to  adequately  address  potential  impacts  during  construction  and \noperation,  such  as  noise,  dust,  water  quality  and  quantity,  solid  and  liquid  waste,  hazardous \nwaste,  exposure  of  workers  to  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards,  and  cultural  heritage \nconservation. The borrower is developing internal risk management procedures and assigning a \ndirector  of  risk  management  and  compliance  to  be  responsible  for  overall  environmental  and \nsocial  risk  management.  To  minimize  and  mitigate  potential  impacts,  the  project  will  be \ndesigned,  constructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements,  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  general  environmental,  health,  and  safety \nguidelines, and national environment laws and regulations. \n  \n22. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. The 3.9-hectare project site is located in the city core of Yangon on land belonging to \nMRT. The site has been leased to the borrower since 1993, and the project is not expected to \nhave involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts. The due diligence confirms that \n(i)  no  informal  settlers  or  vendors  use  the  project  area,  and  (ii)  the  project  area  and \nsurroundings  have  no  record  of  settlements  of  ethnic  groups  or  indigenous  peoples.  The \nexisting structures on the site are (i) Myanmar Railway Building, (ii) FMI Centre, (iii) Grand Mee \nYa Hta Executive Residence, (iv) Zawygyi House, and (v) two abandoned residential buildings. \nWith  the  exception  of  Myanmar  Railway  Building,  which  will  be  architecturally  restored  and \nconverted  to  a  boutique  hotel,  the  other  buildings  will  be  demolished.  Grand  Mee  Ya  Hta \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nExecutive  Residence  was  vacated  in  October  2013.  FMI  Centre  (office  and  commercial \ncomplex) and Zawygyi House (restaurant) will be vacated in early 2016, after providing at least \n6-month  notice  to  existing  tenants.  The  borrower  engaged  stakeholders  in  the  surrounding \ncommunities  during  the  project  design.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  address  public \ncomplaints is in place. Consultations carried out as part of the initial environmental examination \ndid not identify any outstanding grievances.  \n\n \n23. \nDuring construction, civil work contractors are expected to provide work opportunities for \n2,500 local community residents. During operation, significant employment opportunities will be \ncreated for local residents in the offices and commercial establishments. In addition, about 900 \nstaff, expected to be mostly local, will be employed in the hotels and serviced apartments. The \nproject  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements,  and  the  borrower  will  work  toward \nincorporating the following measures in the project: (i) prioritize hiring of women for 40% of the \njobs created in hospitality and retail, and (ii) impart skill training programs to locally hired staff in \nhospitality  areas  with  at  least  40%  participation  of  women.  The  borrower  (and  its  contractors) \ncommits to comply with the ADB Social Protection Strategy  (2001) covering the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards and national labor laws.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n24.
