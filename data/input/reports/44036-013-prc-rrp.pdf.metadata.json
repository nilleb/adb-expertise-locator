Its  catchment  covers  about \n10% of the total area of Anhui province. The lake is important to industrial and agricultural water \nsupply,  water  transport,  tourism,  and  recreation  in  Anhui  province.  Since  1990,  the  water \nenvironment of Chao Lake has been deteriorating because of the adverse environmental effects \nof rapid economic growth and urban development. During 2000\u20132009, the urban population in \nthe catchment increased by 30% and gross domestic product increased by 500%. \n \nIn 1996, Chao Lake was identified as one  of the top three priority lakes in the PRC for \n4. \nenvironmental  rehabilitation  due  to  its  poor  water  quality.  Since  then,  the  provincial  and  local \ngovernments concerned, supported by the national government and ADB, have provided large \ninvestments  to  control  municipal  and  industrial  pollution  in  the  lake  catchment. 3  These \ninvestments have reduced industrial and municipal wastewater to a certain extent, but they have \nnot addressed all dimensions of the water quality problems in the lake. Chao Lake continues to \nreceive  excessive  amounts  of  organic  matters,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorous.  Particularly  during \nsummer, elevated levels of pollutants and high temperatures result in algal blooms, depletion of \noxygen, and the emission of offensive odors. \n \n5. \nThe  present  average  water  quality  in  the  lake  is  class  IV  under  the  PRC\u2019s  national \nenvironmental  water  quality  standard,  and  50%  of  water  monitoring  points  in  the  lake  are  still \nclass  V.  This  represents  a  slight  improvement  over  the  situation  in  2005  when  overall  water \nquality in the lake was class V+, but is still far from the government\u2019s long-term objective for the \nlake of class III.4 \n \nAs  a  result  of  past  investments  and  regulatory  efforts,  industrial  pollution  control  in the \n6. \nlake  catchment  has  improved.  The  two  main  pollution  sources  yet  to  be  fully  controlled  are \n\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the \nAnhui  Chao  Lake  Environmental  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila  (TA  7701-PRC,  $900,000,  approved  on  10 \nDecember). \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Anhui  Environmental  Improvement  Project  for  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment. \nManila; and ADB. 1996.

Class V water is suitable only for agricultural water supply and general landscaping \nuse. Class V+ water is unsuitable for any use (PRC Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002). \n\n\f2 \n\nStrategic  planning  and \n\ninstitutional  reform.  The  APG  understands \n\nmunicipal  point  sources5 and  nonpoint  source  emissions.6 The  Anhui  Environmental  Protection \nDepartment  estimates  that  municipal  sources  account  for  about  50%  of  existing  organic \nemissions into the lake, 57% of emissions of nitrogen, and 54% of phosphorous. Rural nonpoint \nsource emissions are estimated to account for 42% of organic emissions, 38% of nitrogen, and \n42% of phosphorous.7   \n \n7. \nthat  a \ncomprehensive  approach  is  required  to  solve  water  quality  problems  in  Chao  Lake.  Such  an \napproach  requires  not  only  continuous  investments  to  control  pollution  sources  but  also  the \nadoption  of  a  strategic  planning  framework.  To  support  a  comprehensive  approach,  the  APG \nhas  formulated  the  Chao  Lake  Environmental  Rehabilitation  Master  Plan  (2008\u20132020).  The \nmaster plan suggests the need for about CNY50 billion of investments to develop a wide range \nof  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  These  measures  include  (i)  a  strengthened \ninstitutional  mechanism,  (ii)  expanded  and  upgraded  municipal  wastewater  treatment  plants \n(WWTPs),  (iii)  extension  of  sewerage  networks,  (iv)  a  continuous  industrial  wastewater \ntreatment control program, (v) comprehensive rural nonpoint source pollution control, (vi) control \nof other nonpoint source pollution sources through in-stream measures, (vii) water conservation, \n(viii) strengthened regulatory supervision, (ix) applied research, and (x) public education. \n \n8. \nAfter  the  master  plan  was  issued,  the  APG  took  the  following  two  important  steps  to \nstrengthen institutional arrangements  in managing the lake basin environment: (i)  reorganizing \nlocal governments in the lake catchment so that the management responsibilities for the entire \nsurface area, the lake foreshores, and most of the upper catchment area were transferred to a \nsingle  local  government  authority\u2014the  Hefei  municipality;  and  (ii)  creating  the  Chao  Lake \nManagement Authority (CLMA), a new subprovincial agency, to provide unified administration of \ngeneral  affairs  relating  to  the  management  of  Chao  Lake.  In  August  2011,  the  State  Council \nordered  the  establishment  of  the  CLMA  to  manage  all  of  the  lake\u2019s  water-related  matters, \nincluding land use planning, water quality and quantity issues, fisheries, navigation, and tourism. \nThe CLMA could be the first lake or river management agency in the PRC that has a sufficiently \ncomprehensive management purview and the first to deal with all aspects of the water cycle.8 \n   \n9. \nLessons. Sustainable management of a lake basin is widely recognized as difficult. An \ninternational study on 28 lakes across the world, financed by the Global Environmental Facility, \nidentified  measures  that  would  lead  to  effective  lake  basin  management:  (i)  adequate \ninstitutions,  (ii)  right  policy  framework,  (iii)  meaningful  stakeholder  participation,  (iv)  relevant \ntechnical  strategies,  (v)  adequate  monitoring  data,  and  (vi)  adequate  financing.9 ADB\u2019s  own \nanalytical  work  supports  a  similar  conclusion.10 Although  all  of  these  six  measures  have  been \napplied in managing the Chao Lake basin, their implementation has not been comprehensive or \n\n                                                \n5  Municipal point sources are mainly liquid waste emissions from urban areas not yet serviced by sewerage systems, \nand inadequately treated emissions from existing municipal wastewater treatment plants which were not designed \nto remove nutrients. \n\n6  Nonpoint source emissions are a result of discharges of domestic waste from unsewered rural households, runoff \nfrom farmers\u2019 fields, waste discharges from animal production enterprises and resuspension of polluted sediments, \nand erosion of river banks during high flow conditions. \n\n7  Industrial point sources account for less than 8% of organic emissions and 6% of nutrient emissions to the lake. \n8  Q.

The  assessment  is  detailed  in  a  knowledge  product  entitled  Sustainable  Lake \nManagement: Implications for Chao Lake Rehabilitation.11  \n \n10. \nThe  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  sustainable  development  agenda  for  establishing  an \nenvironmentally  friendly,  resource-efficient,  and  harmonious  society,  as  outlined  in  the  PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  The  project  will  support  the  master  plan  and  the  PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan  for  Chao  Lake  environmental  protection,  and  introduce  an  integrated \napproach  to  overcoming  current  constraints  on  restoring  the  lake  environment.  The  project  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC  in  supporting \nenvironmental sustainability and inclusive growth.12 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe project impact will be improved quality of life and a sustainable aquatic ecosystem in \nChao Lake. The outcome will be improved water resources and environment in Chao Lake and \nupstream rivers. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe project comprises four outputs: (i) increased municipal point source pollution control, \n(ii) enhanced nonpoint source pollution control, (iii) improved institutional capacity of the CLMA, \nand (iv) strengthened project management capacity. \n \n13. \nIncreased  municipal  point  source  pollution  control.  This  output  includes  (i) \nconstruction of 584 kilometers of wastewater collection network in developed urban areas that \nare  currently  unsewered,  and  interception  of  untreated  sewer  discharges  that  currently  flow \ndirectly  into  the  tributaries  of  Chao  Lake;  and  (ii)  design  and  construction  of  eight  WWTPs  in \nareas where collection systems will be constructed under the project.13 All WWTPs constructed \nunder the project will be of class 1A design which provides for active nutrient removal.   \n \n14. \nEnhanced  nonpoint  source  pollution  control.  This  output  includes  (i)  dredging, \nembankment works, vegetated buffer zones, and enhanced habitat for biota and erosion control \nin eight upstream rivers; (ii) implementation of a solid-waste collection and management project \nin Feidong county to control drifting objects in the area; (iii) construction of artificial wetlands and \nenhanced  habitats  to  reduce  nutrient  loads  into  the  lake;  and  (iv)  support  for  a  pilot  rural \nnonpoint source pollution control activity focusing on the control of agricultural pollution sources. \n\n \n\n15.  An eco-compensation program that stimulates nutrient recycling between animal wastes \nand crop growing through an incentive-based approach will be implemented. It will subsidize the \nproduction of organic fertilizer from animal wastes and provide incentives for farmers to replace \nchemical  fertilizers  with  organic  fertilizers.  In  addition,  nutrient  trading  between  point  sources \nand nonpoint sources in Chao Lake will be tested.  \n \n16. \nImproved institutional capacity of the Chao Lake Management Authority. This output \nwill  comprise  an  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  program  for  the  CLMA.  The \nprogram  will  include  staff  training  through  domestic  and  international  educational  programs, \nprocurement  of  equipment,  and  a  series  of  studies  on  (i)  spatial  land  use  management  of  the \nChao Lake catchment based on water quality functional zoning, (ii) an early warning system for \n\n                                                \n11 Executive  Summary  of  Knowledge  Product:  Sustainable  Lake  Management:  Implications  for  Chao  Lake \n\nRehabilitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 ADB. 2012.

In  addition,  through  a  knowledge  partnership  with  the \nUnited  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization-International  Institute  for \nHydraulic  and  Environmental  Engineering,  ADB  is  engaging  its  staff  to  conduct  the  capacity \nbuilding for the CLMA, which will help develop the understanding and capacity of CLMA staff to \napply principles of integrated water resources management. \n \n17. \nStrengthened project management capacity. This output will provide support through \nan  international  consulting  company  to  assist  the  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  on \nengineering  design  review,  procurement,  and  project  management  and  supervision.  Selected \nPMO  staff  will  receive  training  at  the  early  stage  of  the  project,  including  training  on  financial \nmanagement,  disbursement,  and  procurement  procedures;  safeguard  requirements;  and \nreporting. Consulting services will also be provided to ensure the project\u2019s sustainability through \n(i) corporatizing and strengthening wastewater services in the project areas,14 and (ii) reforming \nwastewater tariffs to ensure sustainable operations and adoption of a pro-poor approach. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $432.11  million,  including  contingencies  of  $49.57 \nmillion,  financing  charges  of  $13.99  million,  and  taxes  and  duties  of  $21.50  million.  ADB  will \nfinance taxes and duties on items financed by ADB loan.15 The investment plan is summarized \nin Table 1 and detailed in the project administration manual (PAM).16 \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nIncreased municipal point source pollution control \n\nImproved institutional capacity of Chao Lake Management Authority \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n  \na  Includes taxes and duties of $21.50 million to be financed from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan and the \n\n \nBase Costb \n1. \n2.

The  design  of  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment will incorporate the best international practices for wastewater service companies. \n\n15 ADB decided to finance taxes and duties because these (i) are within reasonable country thresholds, (ii) apply only \nto  ADB-financed  expenditures,  (iii)  do  not  represent  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan,  and  (iv)  the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $250  million,  or  57.86%  of  the  total  project \n19. \ncost, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, 17  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n20. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. Government counterpart financing amounts to $182.11 \nmillion,  or  42.14%  of  the  total  project  cost  to  cover  civil  works;  design,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement expenses; taxes and duties; and contingencies. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nMunicipal/county governments \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n250.00 \n182.11 \n432.11 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n57.86 \n42.14 \n100.00 \n\n21. \nThe  borrower  will  be  the  Government  of  the  PRC.  The  government  will  make  the  loan \nproceeds  available  to  the  APG.  The  APG  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the \nparticipating  municipal  and  county  governments,  which  in  turn  will  make  the  loan  proceeds \navailable to the implementing agencies. The APG will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks for the loan. The onlending arrangements and indicative funds flow diagram \nare provided in the PAM (footnote 16). Each onlending will be undertaken based on terms and \nconditions specified in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nThe APG will be the executing agency, and will establish a project leading group (PLG) \nto  guide  overall  project  implementation  and  to  ensure  proper  coordination  across  the \nmunicipalities and agencies concerned. The PLG will be chaired by a vice-governor with heads \nof  provincial  agencies  and  municipalities  and  counties  concerned  as  members.  The  vice-\ngovernor  will  chair  the  PLG\u2019s  quarterly  meetings  to  review  project  implementation,  resolve \ncoordination issues, and ensure timely project completion. The APG has established and staffed \nthe project management office  in the CLMA to coordinate and manage project implementation \non a day-to-day basis.   \n \n23. \nThe  15  subprojects  under  the  four  outputs  will  be  implemented  in  two  participating \nmunicipalities\u2014Hefei18 and  Lu\u2019an,  and  in  seven  participating  counties\u2014Changfeng,  Chaohu, \nFeidong,  Feixi,  Hanshan,  Lujiang,  and  Wuwei.19 A  PMO  has  also  been  established  in  each \nmunicipality  and  county  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  subprojects  on  behalf  of  the \nrespective  governments.  The  15  subprojects  will  be  implemented  by  13  implementing \n\n                                                \n17 Interest  includes  a  maturity  premium  of  0.2%,  which  is  based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  the  government\u2019s \n\nchoice of repayment option and dates. \n\n18 The CLMA falls under the Hefei municipality. However, it receives a separate allocation under the loan. \n19 Five of these participating counties\u2014Changfeng, Chaohu, Feidong, Feixi, and Lujiang\u2014are under the jurisdiction \nof the Hefei municipality but will receive fund allocations under the loan to finance their respective subprojects. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nagencies,20 which will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation.

The \n24. \ntechnical  design  of  the  project  and  its  outputs  have  been  aligned  with  sector  strategies  and \npriorities and have incorporated international and national best practices.21 The implementation \nschedule  and  project  management  arrangements  have  been  assessed  as  appropriate.  The \noperation  of  project  facilities  will  be  undertaken  by  the  implementing  agencies,  which,  with \ncapacity  strengthened,  will  have  adequate  professional  operators.  International  consulting \nservices will provide technical support to the PMOs and implementing agencies to ensure that (i) \nADB and PRC safeguard policies and regulations are fully complied with; and (ii) procurement \nand  contract  management,  financial  management,  fund  withdrawal  and  disbursement,  and \nreporting are in accordance with ADB and PRC requirements. The project design has a number \nof  innovative  features,  including  integration  of  the  Chao  Lake  Environmental  Rehabilitation \nMaster Plan into the project design, support for CLMA capacity building, and pilot rural nonpoint \nsource pollution control. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  overall  project  confirms  that  the  project  is  economically \n25. \nviable, with an economic internal rate of return of 13.1%.22 The economic net present value at \n12%  discount  rate  is  CNY143.2  million,  and  the  economic  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  is  1:1.  Sensitivity \ntests indicate that the overall project is sensitive to both cost increases and benefit decreases, \nwith  a  7.5%  increase  in  investment  costs  or  a  5.4%  decrease  in  benefits  being  required  to \nreduce  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  less  than  12%.  The  financial  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  final  borrowers  of  the  loan\u2014the  municipal  governments  of  Hefei  and \nLu\u2019an,  and  the  county  governments  of  Changfeng,  Chaohu,  Feidong,  Feixi,  Hanshan,  Lujiang, \nand Wuwei\u2014will be able to generate sufficient revenue to repay the loan.23 Annual debt service \nas  a  portion  of  total  revenue  in  2018  is  estimated  to  range  between  0.20%  (for  Hefei \nmunicipality)  and 0.68%  (for  Lu\u2019an municipality).  The  analysis  also confirms that  the  individual \nwastewater  treatment  subprojects  are financially  feasible,  with  financial  internal  rates of  return \nranging between 2.6% and 4.0%, all well in excess of the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  1.4%.  Moreover,  the  financial  feasibility  of  each  wastewater  treatment  subproject \nwould hold in most adverse scenarios analyzed. The financial internal rate of return of the solid-\nwaste  management  subcomponent  is  estimated at  10.4%,  also well  in excess of  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital and robust to most adverse conditions. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  the  implementing  agencies  shows  that  their \n26. \ncapacity  is  adequate  to  perform  accounting  and  financial  reporting  to  satisfy  the  needs  for \nproject  implementation,  but  training  in  ADB  procedures  will  be  required  in  procurement, \ndisbursement,  project  management,  and  accounting  systems. \nIssues  and  deficiencies \nassociated  with  the  entities\u2019  financial  management  systems  have  been  identified  and  capacity \ndevelopment  measures  were  included  to  ensure  that  the  implementing  agencies  are  able  to \nmeet  the  subprojects\u2019  accounting  and  reporting  requirements.  The  procurement  capacity \nassessment  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies  have \n\n                                                \n21 Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n22 Economic Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Analysis (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nestablished procurement procedures and staffing and have significant procurement experience \nbut  lack  specific  procurement  experience with foreign-funded projects,  including  ADB-financed \nprojects.24 The early engagement of a tendering agent will mitigate resultant risks but extensive \ntraining and support on ADB procurement policies and procedures should be provided. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  APG,  the  PMOs,  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe rural poor population of the Chao Lake region is estimated at 2.2 million, with a rural \npoverty incidence of 17% using the 2011 national poverty line of CNY2,300. The estimated total \nrural poor population of the project area is 0.9 million, with a rural poverty incidence of 14%. The \nproject  will  create  approximately  9,000  person-years  of  direct  employment  for  about  2,800 \npeople,  generating  an  estimated  CNY400  million  in  earnings  over  5  years.  About  one-third  of \nthe work will be skilled positions and about 40% of the unskilled work will be set aside for poor \npeople. There will be an estimated 4,180 direct jobs during the project operation phase, and this \ncould generate estimated annual earnings of CNY95 million; 75% of the positions are expected \nto  be  unskilled  or  semiskilled.  The  project  is  classified  as \u2015effective  gender  mainstreaming.\u2016  A \ngender  action  plan  to  maximize  gender  design  features  for  the  project  has  been  prepared  to \nensure that (i) women benefit from labor opportunities created by the project to empower them \neconomically,  especially  if  they  are  among  the  households  affected  by  livelihood  impacts;  (ii) \nwomen  participate  in  capacity  building  measures  and  that  their  particular  requirements \nregarding  training  are  considered  so  as  to  improve  their  choices  and  living  standard;  and  (iii) \nwomen  have  access  to  decision-making  processes  affecting  the  project,  in  particular  village \nenvironmental  committees. 25  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  containing \npoverty and social impacts and mitigation measures has been developed.26 A social action plan \nhas also been prepared and is included in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n29. \nBy  improving  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  for  an  estimated  1.4  million  people, \nthe  project  supports  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  for  environmental \nsustainability,  which aims  to  halve the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable access  to  safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. The project will improve the living standards of the \npeople in the project area by providing safer and more spacious public spaces along the rivers, \nand  by  creating  access  to  wastewater  treatment  in  areas  that  are  unserviced.  The  local \ngovernment  price  bureau  will  organize  a  hearing  prior  to  any  increase  on  the  tariff  for  water, \nwastewater,  or  solid  waste  to  discuss  the  amount  of  the  increase  acceptable  to  poor \nhouseholds. Local governments will establish a differential price mechanism for urban and rural \nareas so the poor are given preferential rates for wastewater and solid waste. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30.  Environmental  assessment. The project classification for environment is category A. A \nconsolidated environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and an environmental management \nplan  (EMP)  were  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).27 The  EIA  is \nconsistent with the domestic environmental assessment reports approved in February 2012 by \nthe  four  municipality  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  the  project  area.  Adequate \n\n                                                \n24 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fconsultations  were  conducted  with  affected  persons  and  stakeholders,  and  the  EIA  and  EMP \nreports  have  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  EMP  includes  establishment  of  a \ngrievance redress mechanism, which has been discussed and agreed upon with the APG. The \nAPG, through the provincial PMO, will be responsible for overall implementation and compliance \nwith  the  EMP  mitigation  and  monitoring  plans,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment  arrangements  and  reporting,  and  initiating  corrective  actions  or  measures.  The \nPMO will have final responsibility for implementing a grievance redress mechanism for handling \nany  disputes.  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  PMO  to  implement  the  EMP  and  ensure \ncompliance with the safeguard policy of ADB is considered adequate with institutional capacity \nstrengthening to be provided by loan implementation consultants. A capacity building program, \nwhich includes environmental monitoring, has been included in the project activities.  \n \n31.  The  project  is  expected to generate significant  environmental  benefits: (i)  approximately \n1,660  tons  of  total  nitrogen  and  609  tons  of  total  phosphorus  will  be  removed  from  the  Chao \nLake  basin  through  dredging  and  disposal  of  2.14  million  cubic  meters  of  sediment;  (ii) \nwastewater collection and treatment will reduce pollutant loadings in the river systems each day \nby  12,796  tons  of  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  23,821  tons  of  chemical  oxygen  demand, \n15,768 tons of suspended solids, 1,331 tons of total nitrogen, 266 tons of total phosphorus, and \n1,713 tons of ammonia nitrogen; and (iii) the rehabilitated wetlands will remove an estimated 47 \ntons of total nitrogen, 12 tons of total phosphorus, 168 tons of biochemical oxygen demand, 56 \ntons  of  chemical  oxygen  demand,  and  28  tons  of  ammonia  nitrogen  each  year.  Further,  the \nthree  artificial  wetlands  constructed  under  the  project  will  provide  resting,  nesting,  feeding, \nbreeding,  and  nursery  habitats  for  wildlife,  promoting  biodiversity  in  Chao  Lake.  Possible \nadverse environmental impacts and risks during construction and operational phases are dust, \nnoise,  air,  and  water  pollution  during  construction;  suspended  solids  released  from  stirred  up \nsediments; and odor from WWTPs. All impacts are expected to be prevented or minimized to an \nacceptable level through effective implementation of the EMP and capacity building activities. \n \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n32. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The \npopulation in the project area is ethnically homogenous mainstream Han. There are no impacts \non ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples\u2019 groups in the project area. The project is classified \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement. Although the impacts of land acquisition on most of the \n3,200  affected  people  are  minor,  even  after  design  optimization  more  than  50  people  will  be \naffected  by  house  demolition  and  around  200  people  will  suffer  significant  loss  of  agricultural \nland  which  leads  to  loss  of  more  than  10%  of  their  income-generating  assets.  Major  design \noptimizations were undertaken to improve both the efficiency of the overall project and to reduce \nresettlement and associated social disruptions. After these design optimizations, the project will \naffect  20  villages  of  11  townships  in  nine  counties,  permanently  acquiring  1,251  mu28 of  land \n(1,202  mu  or  96.1%,  as  cultivated  land)  and  temporarily  occupying  1,789  mu  of  land.  An \nestimated 3,050 square meters of buildings (13 houses and other nonresidential structures) will \nbe demolished. A total of 3,168 persons in 817 households will be permanently affected by land \nacquisition  and  house  demolition.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nCNY92.2  million.  Compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  people  and  villages.  Part  of  the \ncompensation will be used for social insurance for the affected people, based on their choice. \n \n33.  Detailed  compensation,  mitigation,  and  training  measures  are  included  in  the  draft \nresettlement plans.29 The Anhui PMO, local PMOs, and implementing agencies are responsible \nfor  preparing,  reviewing,  financing,  implementing,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  resettlement. \nThe  Anhui  PMO  will  engage  an  agency  for  external  monitoring.  Loan  implementation \n                                                \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n29 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nIndigenous  peoples  and \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nconsultants  will  develop  the  capacity  of  offices  responsible  for  implementing  the  resettlement \nplans.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  to  provide  affected  people  with \nsequential  steps  to  follow  in  case  of  grievance.  Affected  people  have  been  informed  of  the \nmeasures  in  the  resettlement  plans  and  grievance  steps  through  public  meetings  and  other \nmeans to ensure that they are aware of their entitlements and legal rights. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \n \n\nRisks \nThe CLMA is a new organization with \nlimited institutional capacity. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nManagement Measures \nEnsure provincial PLG is established with representation from all involved \nsectors and locations. \nImplement the CLMA capacity building component in a timely manner. \nEnsure PLG includes representatives from Hefei and Lu\u2019an  municipalities, \nand  Wuwei  and  Hanshan  counties.  Engage  the  project  implementation \nconsultant. Monitor and report during implementation. \n \nLoan assurance includes agreeing on tariff increases. \nProvincial  finance  bureau  will  pay  debt  service  on  the  loan  if  there  is  a \nshortfall of funds. \nEnsure that implementing agencies establish or appoint an O&M agency at \nthe start of construction, and proper O&M of  works constructed under the \nloan. Synchronize the construction of WWTPs and sewer network. \n\nThe CLMA, as PMO, has limited \nauthority to cooperate with local \ngovernments of Lu'an, Hanshan, and \nWuwei. \nWastewater and solid waste tariffs \nare not increased in a timely manner \nand  by a sufficient amount. \nFinalizing O&M arrangements is \ndelayed for completed project \nfacilities. \nCLMA  =  Chao  Lake  Management  Authority,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PLG  =  project  leading  group,  PMO  =  project \nmanagement office, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  the  APG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 16) and loan documents. The government and the APG have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$250,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Anhui  Chao  Lake  Environmental \nRehabilitation Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n24 October 2012 \n\n                                                \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nImproved quality of \nlife and sustainable \naquatic ecosystem in \nChao Lake \n\nOutcome \nImproved water \nresources and \nenvironment in Chao \nLake and upstream \nrivers \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nBy 2025: \nWater quality in Chao Lake and \nupstream rivers restored from \nclass V to class IIIa \n \n \nReduced episodes of harmful \nalgal blooms in Chao Lake \n \n \n \nImproved hygiene conditions and \nreduction of waterborne diseases \nfor 0.8 million people \n \nImproved livelihoods through \nemployment created for 7000 \npeopleb  \nBy 2018: \nReduced chemical oxygen \ndemand discharge by 24,000 \nt/yr; ammonia nitrogen discharge \nby 1,740 t/yr; and phosphorus \ndischarge by 280 t/yrc \n \nAdditional 1.4 million people \nconnected to expanded \nwastewater collection system \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n\nAnnual public health reports \nby the APG \n \n \n \nAnnual state of environment \nreports by provincial and city \ngovernments  \n \n \nMonitoring reports from CLMA \n \n \n \nReports of employment by \nagencies operating ADB-\nfunded works \n\nMonitoring reports by \nmunicipality and county \nenvironment protection \nbureau and water resources \nbureau \n \nAnnual livelihood surveys by \nthe municipality and county \npoverty alleviation and \ndevelopment office \n\nMunicipality and county \ndisease control center reports \n \nCLMA reports \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \nChao Lake environmental \nprotection management plan \n(2008\u20132020) effectively \nimplemented \n \nContractors and operators \nprovide skills training, especially \nto women and the poor \n \n \nRisk \nGovernment budget inadequate \n\nAssumptions \nMunicipality and county 12th \nfive-year plans for social and \neconomic development plan and \nwater resources effectively \nimplemented \n \nMunicipality and county pollution \ncontrol plan effectively \nimplemented \n \n \nLocal communities willing to \nparticipate \n\n \nRisks \nIneffective enforcement of \nenvironmental regulations \n \nWastewater collection and \nWWTP O&M not implemented \neffectively  \nAssumptions \nLocal governments expand \nwastewater treatment to include \n100% of wastewater collected \n \nCustomers are willing to pay \nincreased tariffs \n\n \n \nRisks \nMunicipality and county \ngovernments favor economic \ndevelopment over \nenvironmental protection  \n \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.
