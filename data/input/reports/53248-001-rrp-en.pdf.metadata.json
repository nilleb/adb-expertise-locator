Hedging  instruments  are  also  crucial  for  financial \narbitrage, i.e. the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset \nto  profit  from  an  imbalance  in  the  price  or  to  exploit  price \ndifferences  of  identical  or  similar  financial  instruments  on \ndifferent markets or in different forms, a crucial pre-condition \nof efficiency in financial markets. \nThe  objective  of  IFRS  16  is  to  report  information  that  (a) \nfaithfully  represents  lease  transactions  and  (b)  provides  a \nbasis for users of financial statements to assess the amount, \ntiming and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. \nInterest rate risk is the danger that the value of a bond or other \nfixed-income investment will suffer as the result of a change in \ninterest rates. \nMarket making is typically required of primary dealers to offer \nboth a buy price and a sell price for the same security. \nThe  Medium  Term  Debt  Management  Strategy  (MTDS)  is  a \nplan that Government intends to implement over the medium \nterm  to  achieve  a  composition  of  the  debt  portfolio  that \ncaptures its preferences with regard to the cost-risk trade-off. \nMarket  where  financial  instruments  such  as  treasury  bills, \ncorporate  notes,  and  repurchase  agreements  are  used  by \nfinancial \nliquidity \nfund \nrequirements  or  invest  their  short-term  cash  surpluses. \nDeveloping  money  markets  helps  provide  banks  with  more \ncertainty over the size of the deposit pool they can rely on to \nfund their long term loans to project their liquidity needs and \nlend or borrow cash from the markets to balance their books \n(key aspects of maturity transformation \u2014 explained in more \ndetail below). \nFinancial  Market  Infrastructure  (FMI)  refers  to  critically \nimportant \nfor  providing  clearing, \nsettlement  and  recording  of  monetary  and  other  financial \ntransactions.

It provides the Market with a fully automated \ntrading system. \nPrice discovery refers to the act of determining the proper price \nof  a  security,  commodity,  or  good  or  service  by  studying \nmarket supply and demand and other factors associated with \ntransactions. \nPrimary  dealers  bid  for  government  contracts  competitively \nand purchase the majority of Treasury bills, bonds, and notes \n\ninstitutions  responsible \n\ntheir  short-term \n\ninstitutions \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fRefinancing risk \n\n\u2013 \n\nRegular \nTreasury Bill \nProgram \n\nRepurchase \nagreement \n(\u201crepo\u201d) \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nat  auction.  Primary  government  securities  dealers  sell  the \nTreasury securities that they buy from the central bank to their \nclients, creating the initial market. \nRefinancing risk, in banking and finance, is the possibility that \na  borrower  cannot  refinance  by  borrowing  to  repay  existing \ndebt. Refinancing risk increases during rising interest rates, as \nthe  borrower  may  not  have  sufficient  income  to  afford  the \nhigher interest rate on a new loan. \nA  program  that  provides  a  constant  supply  of  benchmark \nTreasury  bills  issued  by  auction  on  a  regular  basis  (weekly \nand/or  fortnightly)  across  a  range  of  key  maturities  (one  or \nmore of 90, 180, 270, 365 days), and is generally self-funding \nas the same principal value is issued in each auction. \nA  form  of  short-term  borrowing  for  dealers  in  government \nsecurities.

For  the  party  selling  the  security  (and \nagreeing to repurchase it in the future), it is a repo; for the party \non  the  other  end  of  the  transaction  (buying  the  security  and \nagreeing to sell in the future), it is a reverse repo agreement. \n \n \n\nNOTE \n\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars and \u20ac refers to Euros. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nVice-President \nDirector General  Werner E.

It builds on previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) programmatic \nassistance  to  Armenia  and  the  reform  momentum  maintained  through  its  post-program \nengagement framework. Reforms under the proposed program aim to further (i) strengthen the \nmanagement  of  public  debt  and  fiscal  risks  to  support  the  authorities\u2019  efforts  towards  fiscal \nconsolidation;  (ii)  improve  interbank  markets  liquidity  by  deepening  the  government  securities \nmarket and improving the infrastructure for money markets; and (iii) foster the development of \ncapital  markets  by  enhancing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  new  instruments  and \ninvestment  vehicles.1 This  medium-term  reform  agenda  will  also  help  deliver  more  predictable \nfiscal outcomes over time, as required by the new government program of February 2019 (Para \n10).  A  second  Post-Program  Engagement  Framework  (PPEF)  is  also  proposed  to  assist  with \nreform  objectives  during  2020-2021. The  proposed  support  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy \n2030, which prioritizes developing market institutions to support private sector development and \nenhance financial stability.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\nPotential  output  growth  in  Armenia  is  partly  limited  by  low  levels  of  investment,  which \n3. \ndeclined from  about  40%  of gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  before the global financial  crisis to \nless  than  18%  in  2017\u20132018. 3 A  strong  and  sustainable  rebound  is  unlikely  unless  reforms \naddress the high costs of local currency finance and the constraints to the financial system\u2019s own \ncapacity  to  generate  medium-term  lending.4 Pricing  benchmarks  for  financial  contracts  in  local \ncurrency  are  currently  nonexistent  for  medium-term  tenors  or  are  very  steep  at  the  short-term \ntenors  available. 5 Foreign  currency  lending  remains  common  practice  in  the  banking  sector, \nwhether the parties recognize the key risks or not. The consequence is that the economy remains \ndollarized,  vulnerable  to  external  shocks,  and,  indirectly,  also  constrained  from  a  price \ncompetitiveness perspective.6 Promoting financial deepening in local currency is a priority, and \nalso requires key efficiency-promoting upgrades in public investment and fiscal management. \n\n                                                \n1  Reform processes in these areas were initiated under ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to Armenia for \nthe Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program. Manila. The proposed program finalizes some of these efforts. \n2   Specifically,  Operational  Priority  6  on  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.  Also  see  ADB.  2019. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2020\u20132022. Manila. (circulated to the ADB Board of Directors); and \nADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Armenia, 2020\u20132023. Manila (circulated to the ADB Board of Directors).  \n3  The pre-2009 capital inflows and credit-induced construction boom had fueled significant property investment. The \ncontraction in investment as a share of  GDP since then  is expected to end in 2019, and pro-growth  government \npolicies can help revive it, especially if business environment challenges and geopolitical risks are addressed. \n\n4  Maturity transformation is a key function of banking. The maturity mismatch needed to facilitate long-term investment \n\nprojects, while serving agents\u2019 liquidity needs, is a key driver of the net interest margin in banking.  \n\n5  At the current Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) policy rate of 5.5%, risk-free rates for highly liquid instruments with a \n5-year tenor are about 8.5% (and above 10% for a 10-year tenor). With risk premiums considered, maximum tenors \non offer by commercial banks in local currency are now below 24 months and on average at rates of about 13%. \n6  In  highly  dollarized  economies,  short-term  exchange-rate  pass-through  to  local  prices  and  \u201cfear  of  floating\u201d  (for \ncurrency mismatch concerns in the private and public sectors) tend to produce a preference for nominal exchange \nrate stability in monetary policy decisions, at the expense of real effective exchange rate appreciation. \n\n \n\n\fCore development problem. While Armenia\u2019s financial institutions have improved over \n4. \nthe  years, financial  markets remain nascent. 7 This  limits  Armenia\u2019s  private sector  and  banking \ndevelopment, constrains public finance and fiscal management, and threatens macroeconomic \nand  financial  stability. 8 The  proposed  program  builds  on  momentum  created  during  the  ADB \nassistance  of  2017\u20132018  by  addressing  key  outstanding  issues  at  the  root  of  this  core \ndevelopment problem. These issues are summarized in the three problem areas below.9  \n\n5. \nRoot problem area 1: Public debt and fiscal risk management. Gaps in public debt \nand fiscal  risk  management  still  hold  back  fiscal  credibility  in  Armenia  and  pose risks  to fiscal \nconsolidation.  To  ensure  fiscal  sustainability  and  sustainably  reduce  risk  premiums,  these \nfunctions need to continue becoming more effective and credible in meeting their core objectives. \nADB\u2019s  programmatic  assistance  in  2017\u20132018  initiated  the  medium-term  reform  agenda  to \naddress these constraints (see some achievements in Para 8).10 But key upgrades still need to \nbe established or completed, particularly (i) in fiscal risk management (to expand the scope of \nfiscal  risks  covered, the type  of  management  exercised  and  its  access to information,  and the \neffectiveness  of  the  function  in  overall  terms),  (ii)  in  public  debt  management  (to  gradually \nincrease reliance on local currency market-based instruments at shorter tenors, and more reliably \ncommunicate strategic directions with market players), and (iii) in establishing an effective and \ncredible legal and regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure services.  \n\nRoot problem area 2: Government securities and money markets. Gaps of different \n6. \nnature  continue  to  hold  back  efficiency  and  liquidity  in  Armenia\u2019s  government  securities  and \nmoney  markets.  ADB\u2019s  previous  programmatic  assistance  supported  reforms  and  institutional \ndevelopment efforts to start addressing these gaps in 2017\u20132018 (Para 8).11 Key issues that still \nneed  addressing  include  the  weak  cash/liquidity  management  and  forecasting  between  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Armenia  (CBA)  and  the  money-markets \nvolatility these difficulties create, and the need to fully implement legal and regulatory changes to \nincrease  liquidity  in  secured  interbank  markets,  improve  price  discovery,  and  develop  the \nstandardized safe instruments that are still missing. More formalized processes of scrutiny and \nconsultation with market players about market development strategic options are still absent. \n\n7. \nRoot problem area 3: Legal frameworks and corporate transparency. Deficiencies in \nkey legal frameworks for financial instruments and vehicles, and for the protection of investors, \nalong with deep deficiencies in corporate transparency persist. Reform efforts implemented under \nADB\u2019s  first  program  (Para  8)  need  to  be  followed  up  on12 with  the  development  of  the  legal \nframework  for  new  types  of  instruments  and  equity  vehicles,  of  the  insolvency  framework  to \nimprove investors\u2019 protection and confidence, and of the basic pillars of corporate transparency. \n\n                                                \n7  Insurance is only about 1% of the financial system\u2019s assets. Interbank markets are less than 10% of banks\u2019 funding.  \n8  Some 85% of Armenia\u2019s public debt is in foreign currency. This is a fundamental source of vulnerability to shocks. \n9  A  comprehensive  summary  of  these  issues  is  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Finance  and  Public  Sector \nManagement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The systemic consequences of these root \nproblems are (i) high exposure to currency risks; (ii) very high and time-varying liquidity premiums for public debt \nissuance, with exchange rate premiums dominating the pricing of government securities; and (iii) high dollarization. \n10 Before ADB\u2019s first intervention, (i) public debt management lacked effectiveness and  credible  strategic  pillars; (ii) \nfiscal  risk  management  lacked  tools  and  was  significantly  incomplete  in  scope,  played  no  role  in  vetting  new \ninitiatives,  and  exercised  no  risk  management  or  mitigation  responsibilities;  and  (iii)  private  sector  provision  of \ninfrastructure services lacked a legal and regulatory basis and was done in nontransparent, fiscally adverse ways. \n11  Before  the  first  ADB  program,  debt  securities  issuance  practices  and  communication  were  not  adequate  for \ndeveloping  market  benchmarks,  and  new  practices  and  programs  were  needed  to  gradually  reduce  liquidity \npremiums in government debt securities. Lack of market-making frameworks also impeded price discovery. \n\n12 Before the first ADB program, there were many gaps in legal frameworks for new instruments and asset classes. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nPolicy Reform Agenda and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n8. \nADB\u2019s previous programmatic assistance. The program addresses key reform areas \nthat follow on from previous ADB engagement  and remain pertinent to the new government in \nArmenia,  as  clearly  specified  in  the  government\u2019s  2019\u20132023  development  strategy.  Under \nprevious  ADB  programmatic  assistance 13 ,  public  debt  management  was  centralized  and \nstrengthened  through  new  legal  frameworks,  a  new  PPP  policy  was  approved  to  guide  all  the \nlegal and regulatory framework work that followed, new debt issuance instruments and programs \nwere  introduced to improve the functioning  of  short-term financial  markets,  legal reforms  were \napproved  to  strengthen  secured  interbank  lending,  legal  reforms  were  achieved  to  promote  a \nvariety  of  securitization  instruments  and  residential  mortgage  financing,  regulatory  reforms  to \nfacilitate  private  equity  and  other  investment  vehicles  were  approved,  etc.  A  post-program \nengagement framework was  key  in maintaining momentum  in policy  dialogue,  notwithstanding \nthe political reform process that Armenia witnessed since late-2018. These reforms can trigger \nlong-lasting  changes  in  the  institutional  or  policy  environment.  However,  these  take  time  to \nbecome fully embedded in Armenian institutions\u2019 practice. Through the proposed program, ADB \nand the government continue to build on  past achievements and maintain reform focus on the \nemerging issues in each reform area.  \n\n9. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB  has  accumulated  experience  in  policy  dialogue  and  in \nproviding  technical  support  to  governments  in  deepening  domestic  financial  markets  while \nstrengthening public management functions. Its experience in Armenia in the specific areas of the \nproposed program have also allowed it to continue developing, with the government, the general \npolicy direction and specific reform efforts, even during the recent political transition in Armenia. \nThis was assisted by the original technical assistance to ADB\u2019s past programmatic assistance, \nstaff consultancy resources and a regional technical assistance window in ADB.14 Technical and \nguidance  notes  were  instrumental  to  contextualize  proposed  policy  actions  during  the  policy \ndialogue with the government. ADB\u2019s institutional memory of the challenges and lessons in the \nfirst  program  makes  its  assistance  increasingly  more  efficient  in  supporting  the  government \nthrough the implementation of specific multi-year efforts to develop the different underpinnings of \nfinancial markets and to strengthen the key public functions that can best promote and benefit \nfrom  such finance  deepening. These multi-year reform  plans  under  ADB  assistance  inherently \nserve as an organizing framework for (i) continued coordination between development partners \nin Armenia working in public financial management (e.g. the International Monetary Fund [IMF] \nand  the  World  Bank)  and  capital  markets  development  (e.g.  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  [EBRD]);  and  (ii)  adequately  identifying  crucial  sequencing \nchallenges  and  other  policy  action  implementation  difficulties  of  this  type  of  reform  work.15 To \nensure  traction  and  continued  policy  dialogue,  the  second  PPEF  for  2020\u20132021  will  also  be \nsupported by an ongoing ADB technical assistance (TA) project.16 \n\nIntegration  in  government  plans  and  development  partner  coordination.  Reform \n10. \nareas addressed under the program are firmly anchored in the government\u2019s 2019\u20132023 program \nand  complementary  to  IMF  support  provided  under  the  current  Stand-By  Arrangement.17 ADB \ncontinues  to  coordinate  with  the  IMF  and  other  donors  to  ensure  that  overall  support  to  the \ngovernment emphasizes a common set of priorities to help maintain macroeconomic stability and \n\n                                                \n13 Footnote 1.

Yerevan.  \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fpromote  higher  and  inclusive  economic  growth.  These  priorities  are  broadly  reflected  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s 2019\u20132023 program.18 In more specific relation to the scope of the proposed ADB \nprogram,  the  government  program  aims  to  (i)  promote  entrepreneurship,  innovators,  and  their \naccess  to  affordable  and  sustainable  finance  while  ensuring  efficient  and  sustainable  fiscal \npolicies  and  effective  public  debt  management;  and  (ii)  develop  government  debt  markets  to \nsupport  high-value  human  and  capital  investments.19 The  government  program  also  explicitly \nrefers  to  a  fundamental  development  prerequisite:  the  need  to  develop  capital  markets  and \nfinancial institutions as the way to sustainably expand affordable financial services in support of \nprivate  sector  competitiveness.20 This  is  presented  as  a pivotal  common  objective for  both  the \ngovernment and the CBA to pursue. Under the IMF\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement, the CBA will also \naim  to  (i)  safeguard  financial  stability  by  improving  the  risk-based  supervision  framework, \n(ii) strengthen  macroprudential  measures  in  light  of  high  levels  of  dollarization,  (iii)  enhance \nbanks\u2019 foreign currency liquidity buffers, and (iv) develop capital markets to mobilize long-term \ndomestic capital to fund economic developments.  \n\n11. \nReform area 1: Strengthening public debt and fiscal risk management policies and \npractices.  In  this  area,  the  program  continues  to  (i)  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  risk  management  function,  (ii) promote  the  development  of  fiscally \nresponsible and planning-relevant public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), and (iii) enhance market \ntransparency  and  predictability  in  public  debt  management.  To  strengthen  the  government\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to ensure effective mapping and management of the risks that pose a threat \nto fiscal stability, and in the sequence of past efforts under ADB assistance (coordinated with IMF \nassistance),  the  government  (i)  approved  the  charter  of  a  new  Fiscal  Risks  and  Statistics \nDepartment21 (to elevate the institutional positioning of this role within MOF from a division to an \nactual  department,  and  promote  its  access  to  information),  and  (ii)  approved  an  update  to  the \nRoadmap  of  Fiscal  Risks  Management  Improvement 22  with  the  objective  of  establishing  an \nintegrated risk management framework (policy action 1; see policy matrix in Appendix 3).  \n\n12.  MOF  will  be  considering  proposals  to  develop  the  required  human  resources  and \nanalytical capacity of the new Fiscal Risks and Statistics Department during the second PPEF \n(2020\u20132021), so that it can fulfill its coordinating mandate with line ministries (as risk owners) and \nensure  that  a  new  integrated  fiscal  risk  management  framework  road  map  is  implemented \neffectively. Under this second PPEF, the government will also aim to improve the transparency in \nthe reporting and accounting of  state-owned enterprises. This will all be  complemented by the \ncompletion  of  a full-fledged risk  vetting  and monitoring framework for  PPPs  based  on the  new \nlegal framework, with fiscal affordability limits and an explicit linkage to Armenia\u2019s fiscal rule. \n\n                                                \n18 The common emphasis is on four key pillars identified in the 2019\u20132023 government program: (i) anchoring fiscal \npolicy  on  the  fiscal  rule  to  maintain  debt  sustainability;  (ii)  strengthening  the  monetary  policy  framework  and \nmaintaining a flexible exchange rate system; (iii) safeguarding the financial system and improving access to finance; \nand (iv) implementing structural reforms, with renewed emphasis on inclusiveness and governance. \n\n19 On fiscal management, see point 2 of section 1 and point 1 of section 3.2 of the government program (footnote 3). \n20 Section 5.3 of the new program recognizes the need for reforms to reduce the gaps, barriers, and issues in Armenia\u2019s \nfinancial  intermediation  to  mitigate  risks,  lower  credit  interest  rates,  and  increase  banking  stability  and  credit \nopportunities  to  private  entrepreneurs.  Categorical  statements,  e.g.,  in  section  5.6,  that  developing  market \nmechanisms to bring investors in entrepreneurial assets in contact with domestic savers is \u201can important precondition \nfor sustainable development,\u201d are noteworthy and explicitly referred to as (i) a way of giving Armenian citizens access \nto diversified saving opportunities \u201cthrough the acquisition of bonds or stocks of non-financial corporations\u201d; (ii) a \njustification  for  \u201cexpanding  the  availability  of  alternative  financial  instruments  (e.g.,  through  the  development  of \ninvestment funds) and making easier for non-financial corporates to enter capital markets to issue securities (IPOs)\u201d; \nand (iii) crucial to enable large-scale infrastructure investments and private sector participation in their development. \n\n21 To include vetting and mitigation responsibilities as well as monitoring and reporting of risks. \n22 Originally approved in 2017 through the Ministry of Finance order no. 448 dated 31 August 2017. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fUnder  the  program,  ADB  supported  the  legislative  consultation  processes  led  by  the \n13. \nMinistry of Economy (MOE) and which resulted in Parliament approval of a PPP law in June 2019 \nthat  is  both  fiscally  responsible  and  planning-relevant  (this  was  also  coordinated  with  IMF \nassistance). This law includes key features such as: the exclusion of unsolicited proposals and \ninstitutional PPPs from its scope; clarity on the institutional distribution of roles for PPP pipeline \ndevelopment, as well as clarity on the fundamental principles and criteria for PPP development \nand approval; and awarding the MOF with a key gatekeeper role in PPP approvals. To promote \nstakeholder  awareness  of  the  underlying  policy  choices  taken  (and  for  overall  reform \neffectiveness), and based on the new law, the government also developed and circulated for inter-\nministerial consultations a draft government decree and the remaining methodologies/regulations \nand manuals of the needed operational framework for PPPs. To ensure the integration of PPPs \nwith public investment management functions (also currently under development and supported \nby World Bank assistance), the MOE operationalized a PPP policy unit within the newly created \nPublic Investment Policy Department (these efforts are included in policy action 2). \n\n14. \nThe institutionalization of an effective PPP legal and operational framework can guide the \ngovernment  to  pursue  PPP  deals  that  are  fiscally  responsible  and  relevant  to  the  country\u2019s \ninvestment priorities. Ongoing ADB TA efforts focus on strengthening the government\u2019s capacity \nto manage and assess risks in the current stock of concessions (currently around 10% of GDP). \nThrough the second PPEF, the government (i) is committed to approving the PPP government \ndecree and the remaining methodologies to complete the agreed-upon operational framework, \nand (ii) will approve amendments to the current procurement decree if these are confirmed to be \nrequired to accommodate the operational agenda under the new PPP law. Lastly, the government \nis also committed to continue investing in the institutional and human capacity of MOE for PPP \nidentification, pipeline development, vetting and transaction structuring. \n\n15. \nThe program also aims to promote a more effective, credible, and better communicated \npublic debt management strategy and implementation. The focus of current efforts is on helping \nto provide key annual strategic guidance and credible medium-term planning on the composition \nand  overall  management  of  public  debt  positions  to  markets  and  following  through  on  that \nguidance with actual implementation. This is a crucial institutional behavior upgrade that needs \nto  be  sustainably  achieved  in  Armenia.  Under  the  proposed  program,  the  MOF  implemented \nMedium-Term  Debt  Strategy  (MTDS),  2019\u20132021,  within  its  benchmark targets for refinancing \nrisk, interest rate risk, and exchange rate risk, with minimal deviations. MOF also approved an \nupdate  of  the  MTDS  for  2020\u20132022  with  more  stringent  benchmarks  in  terms  of  reducing \nexposures  to  exchange  rate  risk  and  restructuring  the  composition  of  deficit  financing  toward \nincreasing domestic borrowing.23 The MOF has also remained on track in the implementation of \nthe Treasury Securities Issuance Plan, in terms of amounts and tenors, without any unjustified \ncancellations, and with producing regular due updates to market players. The MOF also approved \nand  publicized  guidelines  for  buying  government  securities  via  Treasury  Direct,  thereby \nexpanding retail investors\u2019 access to its Retail Debt Program (efforts included in policy action 3). \n\n16. \nUnder  the  second  PPEF  and  with  TA  support,  the  government  is  committed  to \nimplementing the MTDS 2020\u20132022 with minimal deviations; and to updating and approving an \nMTDS 2021\u20132023 that continues targeting the strategic reduction of exposures to exchange rate \nrisk and continue the shift towards increased reliance on domestic net borrowing.24  \n\n                                                \n23 The projected share for net borrowings in domestic securities in total new borrowings continues to increase at each \n\nnew MTDS. Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia. http://www.minfin.am/en/page/strategy/. \n\n24 The approach followed is that each annual MTDS update should be implemented within more stringent benchmark \n\ntargets to reduce foreign currency exposure and increase the reliance on market-based instruments. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f17. \nReform  area  2:  Improving  government  securities  market  and  money  market \ninfrastructure.  This  reform  area  is  centered  around  three  key  fronts:  (i)  strengthening \ncollaboration  between  the  MOF  and  the  CBA  and  their  public  communication  regarding \ncommitments to develop financial and capital markets; (ii) improving liquidity management and \nforecasting  between CBA  and  MOF,  while  significantly  improving the  availability  of  benchmark \nsecurities and price-discovery in government securities; and (iii) implementing the Global Master \nRepurchase Agreement (GMRA) to establish liquid secured interbank markets. EBRD assistance \nis also supportive of this reform agenda. Collaboration between the CBA and MOF in developing \nfinancial and capital markets must be promoted, as well as the communication and collaboration \nwith  financial  market  players  in  the  setting  of  priorities.  The  program  promotes  this  close \ncollaboration between the MOF and CBA, through the joint public reporting on progress made \nalong the time-bound road map for the medium-term development of capital and financial markets \nin the country (this is policy action 4).25 Under the second PPEF, the MOF and CBA are expected \nto approve a full-fledged financial and capital market development program to be approved by the \ncabinet  of  ministers,  and  ADB  assistance  will  continue  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  and \nsupport its market consultations, for its relevance and ultimate effectiveness.  \n\n18. \nUnder the program, the Public Debt Management Department (PDMD) operationalized \nthe cash management framework and implemented a road map to upgrade its cash management \nand improve its interface with the systemic liquidity management and forecasting of the CBA. In \naddition,  the  MOF  (i.e.  PDMD)  implemented  key  modifications  to  further  develop  the  Regular \nTreasury  Bill  Program  and  the  primary  dealership,  market-making  system  (these  efforts  are \nincluded  in  policy  action  5).  Under  the  second  PPEF,  the  PDMD  is  committed  to finalizing  the \nimplementation  of  the  road  map  to  improve  cash  management,  and  the  CBA  is  committed  to \napproving all the regulations for the Stock Exchange to offer bond switch auction solutions. \n\n19. \nTo  establish  the  conditions  for  liquid  secured  interbank  markets,  the  CBA  continued  to \nimplement key steps of the time-bound GMRA road map. Among others, these include submitting \nlegal amendments to cabinet to ultimately eliminate re-characterization risks in repo (interbank) \ntransactions  (included  in  policy  action  6). 26  These  legal  amendments  require  parliamentary \napproval, which will be supported under the second PPEF as well as the remaining steps of the \ntime-bound GMRA road map. This will entail (i) final parliamentary approval of legal reforms to \naddress re-characterization risks, (ii) CBA issuance of an Armenia GMRA annex, (iii) issuance of \nthe  GMRA  legal  opinion,  and  (iv)  approval  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding  (or  general \nagreement)  between  the  CBA  and  commercial  banks  to  facilitate  the  systems\u2019  wholesale \ntransition to the GMRA. Through the second PPEF, the CBA is committed to approve interest rate \nbenchmarking proposals and introduce enhancements in the real-time gross settlement system. \n\n20. \nReform area 3: Broadening the base of instruments and investors and enhancing \ncorporate  transparency.  In  this  area,  this  reform  agenda  aims  to  sustain  previous  efforts  to \nstrengthen the legal and regulatory framework for new instruments and corporate transparency\u2014\nto  encourage  both  more  active  investors  and  issuers  into  participating  in  Armenian  capital \nmarkets. 27  The  reform  efforts  pursue  three  key  policy  objectives:  (i)  developing  the  legal \nframework for new types of securities and to broaden the investor base, (ii) developing the legal \n\n                                                \n25 This road map was established via a memorandum of understanding between the two state institutions. \n26 Under Armenian legislation it is still possible that repo contracts are interpreted in court as akin to a secured loan or \na  donation,  which  could  take  away  settlement  finality  from  the  instrument.  The  current  Armenian  civil  code  also \ndoesn\u2019t recognize margin call features of repo contracts. These are urgent issues to resolve.   \n\n27 Medium-term reforms in these policy areas are becoming more relevant under the proposed program (2019\u20132021). \nBut international experience shows that interbank money markets and government bond markets development is an \nessential pre-condition for corporate equity and debt markets to develop. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fframework for private equity to increase volumes of resource mobilization, and (iii) adopting an \neffective insolvency framework and the underpinnings of corporate transparency. \n\n21. \nUnder  the  program,  the  government  promoted  a  number  of  important  reforms  to  help \ndevelop new types of securities and broaden the investor base. Notably, the CBA approved the \nset  of  subsidiary  regulations  to  implement  a  new  law  for  residential  mortgage  lending,  took \ninitiatives  to  set  clear  rules  for  investment  companies  to  remove  the  inconsistency  between \nregulatory  regimes  of  investment  companies  and  other  foreign  exchange  market  participants \nlinked to  the foreign  currency  buy/sell  services,  and  revised relevant  regulations of  investment \ncompanies  and  funds  (including  pension  funds)  taking  into  account  the  amendments  to  the \nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 16.28 The CBA also took to regulate non-standardized \nderivative financial instruments to reduce risks and issued norms to improve the availability of all \ncentral depository services for investment and fund managers without mediation (policy action 7). \n\n22. \nUnder the second PPEF, the CBA is committed to examining regulatory and tax incentive \noptions  to  encourage  corporate  debt  issuance.  This  will  include  a  full  examination  of  tax \nimpediments  to  securities  issuance  to  be  shared  with  stakeholders  for  public  consultation.  In \naddition,  the  government  and  CBA  are  expected  to  jointly  issue  draft  policy  guidance \nrecommendations to ensure that, in the case of international financial institutions financing large \ninfrastructure  companies,  (i) preconditions  are  set  in  the  project  design  to  promote  different \nfinancial  instruments  in local  currency;  and  (ii)  wholesale financing initiatives  promote financial \ntransparency and stress the need for credit ratings and external audits. \n\n23. \nDeveloping a legal framework for private equity is expected to result in an increase over \ntime  of  the  volume  of  resources  mobilized  through  deepening  financial  markets.  Under  the \nprogram, Parliament approved amendments proposed by the government to introduce modern \nelements  of  corporate  law.  These  include  (i)  the  concept  of  a  shareholder\u2019s  agreement  and \n(ii) protection of minority investors\u2019 rights. The government has also approved and submitted legal \namendments  to  Parliament  that  allows  single  proprietorships  to  buy  shares  of  limited  liability \ncompanies (included in policy action 8). The development of an effective insolvency framework is \na  crucial  pillar  of  capital  market  development.  To  establish  effective  insolvency  practices,  the \ngovernment established and operationalized specialized courts for insolvency proceedings with \ndedicated  full-time  judges.  It  also  submitted  amendments  to  the  insolvency  framework  to \nParliament  with  the  objective  of  improving  bankruptcy  processes  and  the  effectiveness  of \nspecialized courts for insolvency proceedings (included in policy action 9).  \n\nUnder the second PPEF, the government is committed to taking steps to maximize  the \n24. \nperformance of the specialized courts for insolvency and consider improvements to the insolvency \nlegislation to  ensure  that  insolvency  proceedings  are geared towards  maximizing  the return to \ncreditors. Also under the second PPEF, following parliamentary approval (which is expected in \nNovember 2019) of (i) amendment proposals to the laws on accounting and auditing; (ii) a new \nproposed law on regulation and public oversight of audit and accounting (to delegate regulatory \nfunctions  to  a  new  public  oversight  board  and  the  prospective  chamber  of  accountants  and \nauditors  of  Armenia);  and  (iii)  legislative  proposals  to  establish  mandatory  audits,  the  MOF  is \ncommitted to approving all the necessary sub-legislation and facilitating the establishment of the \nnew self-regulating architecture for the accounting and auditing professions and practices. \n\n                                                \n28 The objective of International Financial Reporting Standards 16 is to report information that (i) faithfully  represents \nlease  transactions;  and  (ii)  provides  a  basis  for  users  of  financial  statements  to  assess  the  amount,  timing,  and \nuncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n25. \nThe ultimate impact of this reform agenda will be fiscal sustainability and resilience in the \nfinance sector of Armenia increased by 2022. The program aims to deepen the financial market \nin Armenia while strengthening the public administration\u2019s ability to manage public debt and fiscal \nrisks via a combination of policy actions (all completed before Board circulation in October 2019). \nThis will be followed up with the second PPEF.  \n \n26. \n\nIn terms of medium-term results expected and expressed qualitatively:  \n\n\u2022  Reform area 1 aims to (i) achieve significant upgrades in fiscal credibility and establish an \nissuance  program  that  is  conducive  to  market  development  and  dominates  debt  policy \nand borrowing practices; (ii) complete an effective framework that only promotes fiscally \nresponsible  and  planning-relevant  PPPs;  and  (iii)  establish  an  effective  capacity  to \nmanage and assess the risks in the current stock of and forthcoming PPPs. Risk premiums \nand rating outlooks would be expected to gradually reflect these efforts and developments, \nwhich naturally can get transmitted across the economy as lower financial costs;29  \n\n\u2022  Reform area 2 aims to help establish a liquid yield curve along key tenors, promoting liquid \nmoney markets (in terms of trading turnover) and establishing formal pricing benchmarks \nin local currency for the entire economy. This also requires bolder market-based public \ndebt issuance efforts that, in local currency, are tantamount to taking on more refinancing \nrisk  in  exchange  for  a  prospective  reduction  in  liquidity  premiums,  and  that  in  foreign \ncurrency preserve benchmarks. This would be expected to significantly and sustainably \nimprove  access  to  finance  in  local  currency  to  private  businesses  in  the  Armenian \neconomy;30  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIn reform area 3, and at the end of the proposed program and of the second PPEF, the \nexpectation is that capital markets can become more active and viable to the private sector \nin  Armenia,  as  pricing  benchmarks  in  local  currency  would  have  been  established  and \nregulatory and tax barriers removed. \n\nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nThe government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac36,506,000 ($40,000,000-equivalent)31 \n27. \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based \non  the  straight-line  method,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  9.25  years  and  there  is  no  maturity \npremium  payable  to  ADB.  The  loan  amount  is  22%  of  the  projected  financing  gap  in  2019, \nreflecting planned development expenditures and relevant essential recurrent expenditures.32 \n\n                                                \n29 Fiscal transparency and capacity is favorable to economies\u2019 borrowing costs and helps increase foreign investor\u2019s \n\ndemand for their sovereign debt, i.e. beyond issues of availability of information on debt servicing capabilities. \n\n30  Reform  and  institutional  practice  efforts  continued,  with  expectations  of  producing  an  increase  in  liquidity  in \ngovernment securities and money markets over time, which would help to gradually reduce foreign currency risk \nexposure by public and corporate borrowers and lenders.  \n\n31 \u20ac0.912659 = $1.00 as of 11 October 2019. \n32 ADB is also processing a policy-based operation in social sectors for budget support in 2019, for $10 million.

The current medium-term fiscal projections produce significant uncertainty with \nregard to development financing needs in 2020\u20132021, which reflects a combination of factors and \nexpectations. For example: (i) the current fiscal overperformance in tax revenue is assumed to \ncontinue in 2020, and (ii) the recent success with sizable market-based debt issuances is factored \ninto the possibilities for 2020 in terms of the ability to fill financing gaps with a much higher reliance \non market-based domestic borrowing and subsequent tapping of the foreign exchange market. \nAlso,  the  government  is  facing  difficulties  in  capital  expenditure  execution  in  2019  that  might \nproduce non-negligible expenditure carryovers to 2020, which can add to the uncertainty in the \ngovernment\u2019s general financing requirements during 2019\u20132021.33 These expectations may be \nconsidered  optimistic,  but  they  reveal  a  new  level  of  revenue  mobilization  and  public  debt \nmanagement  confidence  that  must  be  supported.  One  of  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  current \nassistance to Armenia is to support MOF in moving towards a much higher reliance on market-\nbased domestic borrowing. Successful implementation of these fiscal strategies in 2020\u20132021 will \ndepend not only on the effective implementation of key reforms under the program but also on \ncontinuous fiscal revenue performance.34  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n29.  \nThe MOF is the executing agency. The CBA, the Ministry of Economy, and the MOF are \nimplementing  agencies  in  their  respective  reform  outputs. 35  The  implementation  period  is \nNovember 2018\u2013October 2019 for the reforms included as conditionality. All policy actions have \nalready  been  accomplished.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe following due diligence was carried out during the program: \n\n30. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSafeguards. The program is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \nEconomic. The expected economic benefits from the program are summarized in \npara. 25 and will be monitored during the second PPEF. \n\n                                                \n33 The financing gap is projected at $175 million for 2019 and $1.1 billion for 2020\u20132021.  \n34 The confident implementation of increasingly stringent medium-term debt management strategies will continue to \n\nrequire ADB TA provided under the second PPEF.  \n\n35 The Armenia Stock Exchange and the Financial Markets Association of Armenia will be implementing partners. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGovernance.  ADB  and  the  government  agree  on  public  financial  management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption issues and related capacity development. \nPoverty, social, and gender. No adverse poverty, social, or gender issues that \nrequire specific attention were identified. The program has no gender elements. Its \ncharacteristics  offer  limited  potential  for  gender  mainstreaming  entry  points,  but \nADB  will  continue  to  pursue  opportunities  for  gender  mainstreaming  during  the \nsecond PPEF and under the ongoing transaction TA support. \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe mitigation of external risks remains a priority of the Government of \nArmenia.
