THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Armenia for the Second Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program. \n2.  The proposed program will help strengthen fiscal sustainability and develop financial and \ncapital markets in Armenia. It builds on previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) programmatic \nassistance  to  Armenia  and  the  reform  momentum  maintained  through  its  post-program \nengagement framework. Reforms under the proposed program aim to further (i) strengthen the \nmanagement of public debt and fiscal risks to support the authorities\u2019 efforts towards fiscal \nconsolidation; (ii) improve interbank markets liquidity by deepening the government securities \nmarket and improving the infrastructure for money markets; and (iii) foster the development of \ncapital markets by enhancing the legal and regulatory framework for new instruments and \ninvestment vehicles.1 This medium-term reform agenda will also help deliver more predictable \nfiscal outcomes over time, as required by the new government program of February 2019 (Para \n10). A second Post-Program Engagement Framework (PPEF) is also proposed to assist with \nreform objectives during 2020-2021. The proposed support is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030, which prioritizes developing market institutions to support private sector development and \nenhance financial stability.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Potential output growth in Armenia is partly limited by low levels of investment, which \ndeclined from about 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) before the global financial crisis to \nless than 18% in 2017\u20132018.3 A strong and sustainable rebound is unlikely unless reforms \naddress the high costs of local currency finance and the constraints to the financial system\u2019s own \ncapacity to generate medium-term lending.4 Pricing benchmarks for financial contracts in local \ncurrency are currently nonexistent for medium-term tenors or are very steep at the short-term \ntenors available.5 Foreign currency lending remains common practice in the banking sector, \nwhether the parties recognize the key risks or not. The consequence is that the economy remains \ndollarized,  vulnerable  to  external  shocks,  and,  indirectly,  also  constrained  from  a  price \ncompetitiveness perspective.6 Promoting financial deepening in local currency is a priority, and \nalso requires key efficiency-promoting upgrades in public investment and fiscal management. \n                                                \n1  Reform processes in these areas were initiated under ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to Armenia for \nthe Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program. Manila. The proposed program finalizes some of these efforts. \n2  Specifically, Operational Priority 6 on strengthening governance and institutional capacity. Also see ADB. 2019. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2020\u20132022. Manila. (circulated to the ADB Board of Directors); and \nADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Armenia, 2020\u20132023. Manila (circulated to the ADB Board of Directors).  \n3  The pre-2009 capital inflows and credit-induced construction boom had fueled significant property investment. The \ncontraction in investment as a share of GDP since then is expected to end in 2019, and pro-growth government \npolicies can help revive it, especially if business environment challenges and geopolitical risks are addressed. \n4  Maturity transformation is a key function of banking. The maturity mismatch needed to facilitate long-term investment \nprojects, while serving agents\u2019 liquidity needs, is a key driver of the net interest margin in banking.  \n5  At the current Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) policy rate of 5.5%, risk-free rates for highly liquid instruments with a \n5-year tenor are about 8.5% (and above 10% for a 10-year tenor). With risk premiums considered, maximum tenors \non offer by commercial banks in local currency are now below 24 months and on average at rates of about 13%. \n6  In highly dollarized economies, short-term exchange-rate pass-through to local prices and \u201cfear of floating\u201d (for \ncurrency mismatch concerns in the private and public sectors) tend to produce a preference for nominal exchange \nrate stability in monetary policy decisions, at the expense of real effective exchange rate appreciation. \n ", "2 \n4.  Core development problem. While Armenia\u2019s financial institutions have improved over \nthe years, financial markets remain nascent. 7 This limits Armenia\u2019s private sector and banking \ndevelopment, constrains public finance and fiscal management, and threatens macroeconomic \nand financial stability.8 The proposed program builds on momentum created during the ADB \nassistance  of  2017\u20132018  by  addressing  key  outstanding  issues  at  the  root  of  this  core \ndevelopment problem. These issues are summarized in the three problem areas below.9  \n5.  Root problem area 1: Public debt and fiscal risk management. Gaps in public debt \nand fiscal risk management still hold back fiscal credibility in Armenia and pose risks to fiscal \nconsolidation.  To  ensure  fiscal  sustainability  and  sustainably  reduce  risk  premiums,  these \nfunctions need to continue becoming more effective and credible in meeting their core objectives. \nADB\u2019s programmatic assistance in 2017\u20132018 initiated the medium-term reform agenda to \naddress these constraints (see some achievements in Para 8).10 But key upgrades still need to \nbe established or completed, particularly (i) in fiscal risk management (to expand the scope of \nfiscal risks covered, the type of management exercised and its access to information, and the \neffectiveness of the function in overall terms), (ii) in public debt management (to gradually \nincrease reliance on local currency market-based instruments at shorter tenors, and more reliably \ncommunicate strategic directions with market players), and (iii) in establishing an effective and \ncredible legal and regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure services.  \n6.  Root problem area 2: Government securities and money markets. Gaps of different \nnature continue to hold back efficiency and liquidity in Armenia\u2019s government securities and \nmoney markets. ADB\u2019s previous programmatic assistance supported reforms and institutional \ndevelopment efforts to start addressing these gaps in 2017\u20132018 (Para 8).11 Key issues that still \nneed addressing include the weak cash/liquidity management and forecasting between the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) and the money-markets \nvolatility these difficulties create, and the need to fully implement legal and regulatory changes to \nincrease  liquidity  in  secured  interbank  markets,  improve  price  discovery,  and  develop  the \nstandardized safe instruments that are still missing. More formalized processes of scrutiny and \nconsultation with market players about market development strategic options are still absent. \n7.  Root problem area 3: Legal frameworks and corporate transparency. Deficiencies in \nkey legal frameworks for financial instruments and vehicles, and for the protection of investors, \nalong with deep deficiencies in corporate transparency persist. Reform efforts implemented under \nADB\u2019s first program (Para 8) need to be followed up on12 with the development of the legal \nframework for new types of instruments and equity vehicles, of the insolvency framework to \nimprove investors\u2019 protection and confidence, and of the basic pillars of corporate transparency. \n                                                \n7  Insurance is only about 1% of the financial system\u2019s assets. Interbank markets are less than 10% of banks\u2019 funding.  \n8  Some 85% of Armenia\u2019s public debt is in foreign currency. This is a fundamental source of vulnerability to shocks. \n9  A comprehensive summary of these issues is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance and Public Sector \nManagement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The systemic consequences of these root \nproblems are (i) high exposure to currency risks; (ii) very high and time-varying liquidity premiums for public debt \nissuance, with exchange rate premiums dominating the pricing of government securities; and (iii) high dollarization. \n10 Before ADB\u2019s first intervention, (i) public debt management lacked effectiveness and credible strategic pillars; (ii) \nfiscal risk management lacked tools and was significantly incomplete in scope, played no role in vetting new \ninitiatives, and exercised no risk management or mitigation responsibilities; and (iii) private sector provision of \ninfrastructure services lacked a legal and regulatory basis and was done in nontransparent, fiscally adverse ways. \n11 Before the first ADB program, debt securities issuance practices and communication were not adequate for \ndeveloping market benchmarks, and new practices and programs were needed to gradually reduce liquidity \npremiums in government debt securities. Lack of market-making frameworks also impeded price discovery. \n12 Before the first ADB program, there were many gaps in legal frameworks for new instruments and asset classes. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Policy Reform Agenda and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n8.  ADB\u2019s previous programmatic assistance. The program addresses key reform areas \nthat follow on from previous ADB engagement and remain pertinent to the new government in \nArmenia, as clearly specified in the government\u2019s 2019\u20132023 development strategy. Under \nprevious  ADB  programmatic  assistance13,  public  debt  management  was  centralized  and \nstrengthened through new legal frameworks, a new PPP policy was approved to guide all the \nlegal and regulatory framework work that followed, new debt issuance instruments and programs \nwere introduced to improve the functioning of short-term financial markets, legal reforms were \napproved to strengthen secured interbank lending, legal reforms were achieved to promote a \nvariety of securitization instruments and residential mortgage financing, regulatory reforms to \nfacilitate private equity and other investment vehicles were approved, etc. A post-program \nengagement framework was key in maintaining momentum in policy dialogue, notwithstanding \nthe political reform process that Armenia witnessed since late-2018. These reforms can trigger \nlong-lasting changes in the institutional or policy environment. However, these take time to \nbecome fully embedded in Armenian institutions\u2019 practice. Through the proposed program, ADB \nand the government continue to build on past achievements and maintain reform focus on the \nemerging issues in each reform area.  \n9.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has accumulated experience in policy dialogue and in \nproviding  technical  support  to  governments  in  deepening  domestic  financial  markets  while \nstrengthening public management functions. Its experience in Armenia in the specific areas of the \nproposed program have also allowed it to continue developing, with the government, the general \npolicy direction and specific reform efforts, even during the recent political transition in Armenia. \nThis was assisted by the original technical assistance to ADB\u2019s past programmatic assistance, \nstaff consultancy resources and a regional technical assistance window in ADB.14 Technical and \nguidance notes were instrumental to contextualize proposed policy actions during the policy \ndialogue with the government. ADB\u2019s institutional memory of the challenges and lessons in the \nfirst program makes its assistance increasingly more efficient in supporting the government \nthrough the implementation of specific multi-year efforts to develop the different underpinnings of \nfinancial markets and to strengthen the key public functions that can best promote and benefit \nfrom such finance deepening. These multi-year reform plans under ADB assistance inherently \nserve as an organizing framework for (i) continued coordination between development partners \nin Armenia working in public financial management (e.g. the International Monetary Fund [IMF] \nand  the  World  Bank)  and  capital  markets  development  (e.g.  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development [EBRD]); and (ii) adequately identifying crucial sequencing \nchallenges and other policy action implementation difficulties of this type of reform work.15 To \nensure traction and continued policy dialogue, the second PPEF for 2020\u20132021 will also be \nsupported by an ongoing ADB technical assistance (TA) project.16 \n10.  Integration in government plans and development partner coordination. Reform \nareas addressed under the program are firmly anchored in the government\u2019s 2019\u20132023 program \nand complementary to IMF support provided under the current Stand-By Arrangement.17 ADB \ncontinues to coordinate with the IMF and other donors to ensure that overall support to the \ngovernment emphasizes a common set of priorities to help maintain macroeconomic stability and \n                                                \n13 Footnote 1.

Yerevan.  \n \n ", "4 \npromote higher and inclusive economic growth. These priorities are broadly reflected in the \ngovernment\u2019s 2019\u20132023 program.18 In more specific relation to the scope of the proposed ADB \nprogram, the government program aims to (i) promote entrepreneurship, innovators, and their \naccess to affordable and sustainable finance while ensuring efficient and sustainable fiscal \npolicies and effective public debt management; and (ii) develop government debt markets to \nsupport high-value human and capital investments.19 The government program also explicitly \nrefers to a fundamental development prerequisite: the need to develop capital markets and \nfinancial institutions as the way to sustainably expand affordable financial services in support of \nprivate sector competitiveness.20 This is presented as a pivotal common objective for both the \ngovernment and the CBA to pursue. Under the IMF\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement, the CBA will also \naim  to  (i)  safeguard  financial  stability  by  improving  the  risk-based  supervision  framework, \n(ii) strengthen macroprudential measures in light of high levels of dollarization, (iii) enhance \nbanks\u2019 foreign currency liquidity buffers, and (iv) develop capital markets to mobilize long-term \ndomestic capital to fund economic developments.  \n11.  Reform area 1: Strengthening public debt and fiscal risk management policies and \npractices.  In  this  area,  the  program  continues  to  (i)  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  risk  management  function,  (ii) promote  the  development  of  fiscally \nresponsible and planning-relevant public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), and (iii) enhance market \ntransparency and predictability in public debt management. To strengthen the government\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to ensure effective mapping and management of the risks that pose a threat \nto fiscal stability, and in the sequence of past efforts under ADB assistance (coordinated with IMF \nassistance), the government (i) approved the charter of  a new Fiscal Risks and Statistics \nDepartment21 (to elevate the institutional positioning of this role within MOF from a division to an \nactual department, and promote its access to information), and (ii) approved an update to the \nRoadmap of Fiscal Risks Management Improvement22 with the objective of establishing an \nintegrated risk management framework (policy action 1; see policy matrix in Appendix 3).  \n12.  MOF  will  be  considering  proposals  to  develop  the  required  human  resources  and \nanalytical capacity of the new Fiscal Risks and Statistics Department during the second PPEF \n(2020\u20132021), so that it can fulfill its coordinating mandate with line ministries (as risk owners) and \nensure that a new integrated fiscal risk management framework road map is implemented \neffectively. Under this second PPEF, the government will also aim to improve the transparency in \nthe reporting and accounting of state-owned enterprises. This will all be complemented by the \ncompletion of a full-fledged risk vetting and monitoring framework for PPPs based on the new \nlegal framework, with fiscal affordability limits and an explicit linkage to Armenia\u2019s fiscal rule. \n                                                \n18 The common emphasis is on four key pillars identified in the 2019\u20132023 government program: (i) anchoring fiscal \npolicy on the fiscal rule to maintain debt sustainability; (ii) strengthening the monetary policy framework and \nmaintaining a flexible exchange rate system; (iii) safeguarding the financial system and improving access to finance; \nand (iv) implementing structural reforms, with renewed emphasis on inclusiveness and governance. \n19 On fiscal management, see point 2 of section 1 and point 1 of section 3.2 of the government program (footnote 3). \n20 Section 5.3 of the new program recognizes the need for reforms to reduce the gaps, barriers, and issues in Armenia\u2019s \nfinancial intermediation to mitigate risks, lower credit interest rates, and increase banking stability and credit \nopportunities  to  private  entrepreneurs.  Categorical  statements,  e.g.,  in  section  5.6,  that  developing  market \nmechanisms to bring investors in entrepreneurial assets in contact with domestic savers is \u201can important precondition \nfor sustainable development,\u201d are noteworthy and explicitly referred to as (i) a way of giving Armenian citizens access \nto diversified saving opportunities \u201cthrough the acquisition of bonds or stocks of non-financial corporations\u201d; (ii) a \njustification for \u201cexpanding the availability of alternative financial instruments (e.g., through the development of \ninvestment funds) and making easier for non-financial corporates to enter capital markets to issue securities (IPOs)\u201d; \nand (iii) crucial to enable large-scale infrastructure investments and private sector participation in their development. \n21 To include vetting and mitigation responsibilities as well as monitoring and reporting of risks. \n22 Originally approved in 2017 through the Ministry of Finance order no. 448 dated 31 August 2017. \n ", "5 \n13.  Under the program, ADB supported the legislative consultation processes led by the \nMinistry of Economy (MOE) and which resulted in Parliament approval of a PPP law in June 2019 \nthat is both fiscally responsible and planning-relevant (this was also coordinated with IMF \nassistance). This law includes key features such as: the exclusion of unsolicited proposals and \ninstitutional PPPs from its scope; clarity on the institutional distribution of roles for PPP pipeline \ndevelopment, as well as clarity on the fundamental principles and criteria for PPP development \nand approval; and awarding the MOF with a key gatekeeper role in PPP approvals. To promote \nstakeholder  awareness  of  the  underlying  policy  choices  taken  (and  for  overall  reform \neffectiveness), and based on the new law, the government also developed and circulated for inter-\nministerial consultations a draft government decree and the remaining methodologies/regulations \nand manuals of the needed operational framework for PPPs. To ensure the integration of PPPs \nwith public investment management functions (also currently under development and supported \nby World Bank assistance), the MOE operationalized a PPP policy unit within the newly created \nPublic Investment Policy Department (these efforts are included in policy action 2). \n14.  The institutionalization of an effective PPP legal and operational framework can guide the \ngovernment to pursue PPP deals that are fiscally responsible and relevant to the country\u2019s \ninvestment priorities. Ongoing ADB TA efforts focus on strengthening the government\u2019s capacity \nto manage and assess risks in the current stock of concessions (currently around 10% of GDP). \nThrough the second PPEF, the government (i) is committed to approving the PPP government \ndecree and the remaining methodologies to complete the agreed-upon operational framework, \nand (ii) will approve amendments to the current procurement decree if these are confirmed to be \nrequired to accommodate the operational agenda under the new PPP law. Lastly, the government \nis also committed to continue investing in the institutional and human capacity of MOE for PPP \nidentification, pipeline development, vetting and transaction structuring. \n15.  The program also aims to promote a more effective, credible, and better communicated \npublic debt management strategy and implementation. The focus of current efforts is on helping \nto provide key annual strategic guidance and credible medium-term planning on the composition \nand overall management of public debt positions to markets and following through on that \nguidance with actual implementation. This is a crucial institutional behavior upgrade that needs \nto be sustainably achieved in Armenia. Under the proposed program, the MOF implemented \nMedium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), 2019\u20132021, within its benchmark targets for refinancing \nrisk, interest rate risk, and exchange rate risk, with minimal deviations. MOF also approved an \nupdate of the MTDS for 2020\u20132022 with more stringent benchmarks in terms of reducing \nexposures to exchange rate risk and restructuring the composition of deficit financing toward \nincreasing domestic borrowing.23 The MOF has also remained on track in the implementation of \nthe Treasury Securities Issuance Plan, in terms of amounts and tenors, without any unjustified \ncancellations, and with producing regular due updates to market players. The MOF also approved \nand  publicized  guidelines  for  buying  government  securities  via  Treasury  Direct,  thereby \nexpanding retail investors\u2019 access to its Retail Debt Program (efforts included in policy action 3). \n16.  Under  the  second  PPEF  and  with  TA  support,  the  government  is  committed  to \nimplementing the MTDS 2020\u20132022 with minimal deviations; and to updating and approving an \nMTDS 2021\u20132023 that continues targeting the strategic reduction of exposures to exchange rate \nrisk and continue the shift towards increased reliance on domestic net borrowing.24  \n                                                \n23 The projected share for net borrowings in domestic securities in total new borrowings continues to increase at each \nnew MTDS. Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia. http://www.minfin.am/en/page/strategy/. \n24 The approach followed is that each annual MTDS update should be implemented within more stringent benchmark \ntargets to reduce foreign currency exposure and increase the reliance on market-based instruments. \n ", "6 \n17.  Reform  area  2:  Improving  government  securities  market  and  money  market \ninfrastructure.  This  reform  area  is  centered  around  three  key  fronts:  (i)  strengthening \ncollaboration  between  the  MOF  and  the  CBA  and  their  public  communication  regarding \ncommitments to develop financial and capital markets; (ii) improving liquidity management and \nforecasting between CBA and MOF, while significantly improving the availability of benchmark \nsecurities and price-discovery in government securities; and (iii) implementing the Global Master \nRepurchase Agreement (GMRA) to establish liquid secured interbank markets. EBRD assistance \nis also supportive of this reform agenda. Collaboration between the CBA and MOF in developing \nfinancial and capital markets must be promoted, as well as the communication and collaboration \nwith  financial  market  players  in  the  setting  of  priorities.  The  program  promotes  this  close \ncollaboration between the MOF and CBA, through the joint public reporting on progress made \nalong the time-bound road map for the medium-term development of capital and financial markets \nin the country (this is policy action 4).25 Under the second PPEF, the MOF and CBA are expected \nto approve a full-fledged financial and capital market development program to be approved by the \ncabinet of ministers, and ADB assistance will continue to emphasize the importance of and \nsupport its market consultations, for its relevance and ultimate effectiveness.  \n18.  Under the program, the Public Debt Management Department (PDMD) operationalized \nthe cash management framework and implemented a road map to upgrade its cash management \nand improve its interface with the systemic liquidity management and forecasting of the CBA. In \naddition, the MOF (i.e. PDMD) implemented key modifications to further develop the Regular \nTreasury Bill Program and the primary dealership, market-making system (these efforts are \nincluded in policy action 5). Under the second PPEF, the PDMD is committed to finalizing the \nimplementation of the road map to improve cash management, and the CBA is committed to \napproving all the regulations for the Stock Exchange to offer bond switch auction solutions. \n19.  To establish the conditions for liquid secured interbank markets, the CBA continued to \nimplement key steps of the time-bound GMRA road map. Among others, these include submitting \nlegal amendments to cabinet to ultimately eliminate re-characterization risks in repo (interbank) \ntransactions (included in policy action 6).26 These legal amendments require parliamentary \napproval, which will be supported under the second PPEF as well as the remaining steps of the \ntime-bound GMRA road map. This will entail (i) final parliamentary approval of legal reforms to \naddress re-characterization risks, (ii) CBA issuance of an Armenia GMRA annex, (iii) issuance of \nthe GMRA legal opinion, and (iv) approval of the memorandum of understanding (or general \nagreement)  between  the  CBA  and  commercial  banks  to  facilitate  the  systems\u2019  wholesale \ntransition to the GMRA. Through the second PPEF, the CBA is committed to approve interest rate \nbenchmarking proposals and introduce enhancements in the real-time gross settlement system. \n20.  Reform area 3: Broadening the base of instruments and investors and enhancing \ncorporate transparency. In this area, this reform agenda aims to sustain previous efforts to \nstrengthen the legal and regulatory framework for new instruments and corporate transparency\u2014\nto encourage both more active investors and issuers  into participating in Armenian capital \nmarkets.27 The  reform  efforts  pursue  three  key  policy  objectives:  (i)  developing  the  legal \nframework for new types of securities and to broaden the investor base, (ii) developing the legal \n                                                \n25 This road map was established via a memorandum of understanding between the two state institutions. \n26 Under Armenian legislation it is still possible that repo contracts are interpreted in court as akin to a secured loan or \na donation, which could take away settlement finality from the instrument. The current Armenian civil code also \ndoesn\u2019t recognize margin call features of repo contracts. These are urgent issues to resolve.   \n27 Medium-term reforms in these policy areas are becoming more relevant under the proposed program (2019\u20132021). \nBut international experience shows that interbank money markets and government bond markets development is an \nessential pre-condition for corporate equity and debt markets to develop. \n ", "7 \nframework for private equity to increase volumes of resource mobilization, and (iii) adopting an \neffective insolvency framework and the underpinnings of corporate transparency. \n21.  Under the program, the government promoted a number of important reforms to help \ndevelop new types of securities and broaden the investor base. Notably, the CBA approved the \nset of subsidiary regulations to implement a new law for residential mortgage lending, took \ninitiatives to set clear rules for investment companies to remove the inconsistency between \nregulatory regimes of investment companies and other foreign exchange market participants \nlinked to the foreign currency buy/sell services, and revised relevant regulations of investment \ncompanies and funds (including pension funds) taking into account the amendments to the \nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 16.28 The CBA also took to regulate non-standardized \nderivative financial instruments to reduce risks and issued norms to improve the availability of all \ncentral depository services for investment and fund managers without mediation (policy action 7). \n22.  Under the second PPEF, the CBA is committed to examining regulatory and tax incentive \noptions  to  encourage  corporate  debt  issuance.  This  will  include  a  full  examination  of  tax \nimpediments to securities issuance to be shared with stakeholders for public consultation. In \naddition,  the  government  and  CBA  are  expected  to  jointly  issue  draft  policy  guidance \nrecommendations to ensure that, in the case of international financial institutions financing large \ninfrastructure companies, (i) preconditions are set in the project design to promote different \nfinancial instruments in local currency; and (ii) wholesale financing initiatives promote financial \ntransparency and stress the need for credit ratings and external audits. \n23.  Developing a legal framework for private equity is expected to result in an increase over \ntime of the volume of resources mobilized through deepening financial markets. Under the \nprogram, Parliament approved amendments proposed by the government to introduce modern \nelements of corporate law. These include (i) the concept of a shareholder\u2019s agreement and \n(ii) protection of minority investors\u2019 rights. The government has also approved and submitted legal \namendments to Parliament that allows single proprietorships to buy shares of limited liability \ncompanies (included in policy action 8). The development of an effective insolvency framework is \na crucial pillar of capital market development. To establish effective insolvency practices, the \ngovernment established and operationalized specialized courts for insolvency proceedings with \ndedicated  full-time  judges.  It  also  submitted  amendments  to  the  insolvency  framework  to \nParliament  with  the  objective  of  improving  bankruptcy  processes  and  the  effectiveness  of \nspecialized courts for insolvency proceedings (included in policy action 9).  \n24.  Under the second PPEF, the government is committed to taking steps to maximize the \nperformance of the specialized courts for insolvency and consider improvements to the insolvency \nlegislation to ensure that insolvency proceedings are geared towards maximizing the return to \ncreditors. Also under the second PPEF, following parliamentary approval (which is expected in \nNovember 2019) of (i) amendment proposals to the laws on accounting and auditing; (ii) a new \nproposed law on regulation and public oversight of audit and accounting (to delegate regulatory \nfunctions to a new public oversight board and the prospective chamber of accountants and \nauditors of Armenia); and (iii) legislative proposals to establish mandatory audits, the MOF is \ncommitted to approving all the necessary sub-legislation and facilitating the establishment of the \nnew self-regulating architecture for the accounting and auditing professions and practices. \n                                                \n28 The objective of International Financial Reporting Standards 16 is to report information that (i) faithfully represents \nlease transactions; and (ii) provides a basis for users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and \nuncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. \n ", "8 \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n25.  The ultimate impact of this reform agenda will be fiscal sustainability and resilience in the \nfinance sector of Armenia increased by 2022. The program aims to deepen the financial market \nin Armenia while strengthening the public administration\u2019s ability to manage public debt and fiscal \nrisks via a combination of policy actions (all completed before Board circulation in October 2019). \nThis will be followed up with the second PPEF.  \n \n26.  In terms of medium-term results expected and expressed qualitatively:  \n\u2022  Reform area 1 aims to (i) achieve significant upgrades in fiscal credibility and establish an \nissuance program that is conducive to market development and dominates debt policy \nand borrowing practices; (ii) complete an effective framework that only promotes fiscally \nresponsible  and  planning-relevant  PPPs;  and  (iii)  establish  an  effective  capacity  to \nmanage and assess the risks in the current stock of and forthcoming PPPs. Risk premiums \nand rating outlooks would be expected to gradually reflect these efforts and developments, \nwhich naturally can get transmitted across the economy as lower financial costs;29  \n\u2022  Reform area 2 aims to help establish a liquid yield curve along key tenors, promoting liquid \nmoney markets (in terms of trading turnover) and establishing formal pricing benchmarks \nin local currency for the entire economy. This also requires bolder market-based public \ndebt issuance efforts that, in local currency, are tantamount to taking on more refinancing \nrisk in exchange for a prospective reduction in liquidity premiums, and that in foreign \ncurrency preserve benchmarks. This would be expected to significantly and sustainably \nimprove  access  to finance  in  local  currency  to  private  businesses  in  the  Armenian \neconomy;30  \n\u2022  In reform area 3, and at the end of the proposed program and of the second PPEF, the \nexpectation is that capital markets can become more active and viable to the private sector \nin Armenia, as pricing benchmarks in local currency would have been established and \nregulatory and tax barriers removed. \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n27.  The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac36,506,000 ($40,000,000-equivalent)31 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based \non the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. The loan amount is 22% of the projected financing gap in 2019, \nreflecting planned development expenditures and relevant essential recurrent expenditures.32 \n                                                \n29 Fiscal transparency and capacity is favorable to economies\u2019 borrowing costs and helps increase foreign investor\u2019s \ndemand for their sovereign debt, i.e. beyond issues of availability of information on debt servicing capabilities. \n30 Reform and institutional practice efforts continued, with expectations of producing an increase in liquidity in \ngovernment securities and money markets over time, which would help to gradually reduce foreign currency risk \nexposure by public and corporate borrowers and lenders.  \n31 \u20ac0.912659 = $1.00 as of 11 October 2019. \n32 ADB is also processing a policy-based operation in social sectors for budget support in 2019, for $10 million.

Subject to government request, ADB will stand ready to explore further policy-based \nlending on the basis of the reform engagement with the different implementing agencies during \nthe second PPEF. The current medium-term fiscal projections produce significant uncertainty with \nregard to development financing needs in 2020\u20132021, which reflects a combination of factors and \nexpectations. For example: (i) the current fiscal overperformance in tax revenue is assumed to \ncontinue in 2020, and (ii) the recent success with sizable market-based debt issuances is factored \ninto the possibilities for 2020 in terms of the ability to fill financing gaps with a much higher reliance \non market-based domestic borrowing and subsequent tapping of the foreign exchange market. \nAlso, the government is facing difficulties in capital expenditure execution in 2019 that might \nproduce non-negligible expenditure carryovers to 2020, which can add to the uncertainty in the \ngovernment\u2019s general financing requirements during 2019\u20132021.33 These expectations may be \nconsidered optimistic, but they reveal a new level of revenue mobilization and public debt \nmanagement  confidence  that  must  be  supported.  One  of  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  current \nassistance to Armenia is to support MOF in moving towards a much higher reliance on market-\nbased domestic borrowing. Successful implementation of these fiscal strategies in 2020\u20132021 will \ndepend not only on the effective implementation of key reforms under the program but also on \ncontinuous fiscal revenue performance.34  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.   The MOF is the executing agency. The CBA, the Ministry of Economy, and the MOF are \nimplementing  agencies  in  their  respective  reform  outputs.35 The  implementation  period  is \nNovember 2018\u2013October 2019 for the reforms included as conditionality. All policy actions have \nalready  been  accomplished.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n30.  The following due diligence was carried out during the program: \n \n(i)  Safeguards. The program is classified as category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n(ii)  Economic. The expected economic benefits from the program are summarized in \npara. 25 and will be monitored during the second PPEF. \n                                                \n33 The financing gap is projected at $175 million for 2019 and $1.1 billion for 2020\u20132021.  \n34 The confident implementation of increasingly stringent medium-term debt management strategies will continue to \nrequire ADB TA provided under the second PPEF.  \n35 The Armenia Stock Exchange and the Financial Markets Association of Armenia will be implementing partners. \n ", "10 \n(iii)  Governance. ADB and the government agree on public financial management, \nprocurement, and anticorruption issues and related capacity development. \n(iv)  Poverty, social, and gender. No adverse poverty, social, or gender issues that \nrequire specific attention were identified. The program has no gender elements. Its \ncharacteristics offer limited potential for gender mainstreaming entry points, but \nADB will continue to pursue opportunities for gender mainstreaming during the \nsecond PPEF and under the ongoing transaction TA support. \n31.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of \u20ac36,506,000 to Armenia for the Second Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in regular terms,  with  interest to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n24 October 2019 \n                                                \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nFiscal sustainability and resilience in the finance sector increased by 2022 (Five-Year Government \nProgram)a \n  \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By the end of 2021:     \nDepth of financial  a.
