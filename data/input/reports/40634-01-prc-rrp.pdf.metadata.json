This has brought substantial environmental damage caused by harmful emissions such \nas sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and total suspended particulates (TSP). SO2 and \nNOx are the main causes of acid rain, a pressing environmental problem in the PRC, and TSP \ncauses  serious  respiratory  diseases.  Carbon  dioxide,  the  main  greenhouse  gas,  is  a  major \nemission from coal burning and a cause of global warming. Air pollution is estimated to cost the \nPRC  economy  3.8%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  annually. 1  The  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) depended on coal to meet more than 90% of its energy demand in \n2008. Reliance on coal has a high environmental cost for urban areas in IMAR, as only 6 out of \n15  cities  monitored  for  air  quality  reach  class  II  air  quality  standards.2 IMAR  has  proven  coal \nreserves of more than 47 billion tons, or about 25% of the total coal reserves in the PRC, but it \nhas  less  than  2%  of  the  PRC's  population. 3 IMAR  generates  electricity  for  export  to  other \nprovinces  and  major  load  centers  like  Beijing.  This  causes  disproportionately  high  SO2  and \nother coal emissions in IMAR. In 2008, its SO2 emissions were 1.43 million tons, which is 5% of \nnational  emissions.  Coal  burning  for  district  heating  contributes  10%  of  IMAR  SO2  emissions. \nThe Government of the PRC targets in its Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 a 10% reduction \nin  SO2  emissions  and  a  20%  reduction  in energy  intensity4 by  2010  compared  with 2005.  The \nIMAR  economy  is  relatively  inefficient,  using  2.61  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent  per \nCNY10,000 of GDP, or double the national average of 1.10 tons in 2008. The IMAR target is to \nimprove energy intensity by 25% by 2010. \n \n3. \nDistrict  heating  in  IMAR  depends  primarily  on  coal,  which  provides  95%  of  heating \nrequirements. Moreover, most of the existing district heating infrastructure is old and inefficient. \nThe  IMAR  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  improving  energy  efficiency  in  district \nheating  as  a  priority  toward  achieving  IMAR's  target  for  improving  energy  intensity.  Large \nenergy efficiency gains are attainable from the district heating subsector through replacing and \nupgrading  heat  generators  and  improving  insulation  on  distribution  systems.  Small  heating \nboilers  typically  have  efficiencies  of  40%\u201350%,  while  new,  larger  boilers  have  efficiencies \nexceeding  80%.  Additional  opportunities  for  improving  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  the \nenvironmental impact of district heating are offered by alternative renewable or recycled energy, \nsuch as geothermal energy and using waste heat from industrial processes.  \n \n4. \nDue  to  its  remoteness  and  low  population  density,  IMAR  includes  some  of  the  poorest \nareas  in  the  PRC.  The  population  of  IMAR  was  24.14  million  in  2008,  which  is  1.82%  of  the \nnational  total,  though  IMAR  occupies  12.3%  of  the  land  area.  IMAR  has  31  national  poverty \ncounties  and  29  provincial  poverty  counties  with  800,665  people  living  below  the  poverty  line. \n                                                 \n1  World  Bank  and  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  2007.  Cost  of  Pollution  in  China:  Economic \n\nEstimates of Physical Damage. Washington, DC (conference edition, February). \n\n2   All  energy  sector  data  in  this  document  were  taken  from  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  of  China  and  IMAR \n\nStatistics Bureau unless noted otherwise. \n\n3  International Energy Agency. 2009. Cleaner Coal in China. Paris.  \n4   Energy intensity is measured as primary energy consumption in standard coal equivalent per CNY10,000 of GDP. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  provision  of  reliable,  affordable  household  heating  is  a  basic  necessity  in  IMAR  as \ntemperatures  can  fall  to  \u201340\u00b0C  and  the  heating  season  can  last  for  7  months.  Environmental \nimpacts  from  current  heating  methods  have  a  disproportionately  high  impact  on  the  poor. \nInadequate  coverage  of  district  heating  in  low-income  urban  areas  drives  residents  to  use \nindoor  coal  stoves  for  heating,  which  is  a  major  cause  of  respiratory  disease.  Urban  pollution \nfrom  small,  local  boilers  also  worsens  outdoor  air  pollution  and  causes  significant  cumulative \nharm to public health. The cost of heating for the poor is relatively high. A typical family living on \nthe poverty line in a remote area of IMAR can expect to pay 20%\u201330% of its annual income on \nheating.  Poor-quality  district  heating  has  a  disproportionate  impact  on  women  as  women  take \nmore responsibility for collecting fuel and operating household heating systems and spend more \ntime at home exposed to high indoor pollution.  \n \n5. \nDemand  for  district  heating  is  growing  rapidly  with  strong  economic  growth,  higher \nincomes, and the privatization of housing, which has increased sharply in recent years. Single-\nstory  residences  that  are  expensive  to  supply  with  district  heating  are  rapidly  being  replaced \nwith high-rise residential buildings that are more suitable for district heating. Relocation policies \nfor  rural  herders,  intended  to  reduce  environmental  pressure  on  fragile  pastures,  are  causing \nurbanization and increased demand for district heating. The urban share of IMAR\u2019s population \nincreased from 42.2% in 2000 to 51.7% in 2008.5 As a consequence, the district heating area \nhas expanded rapidly, increasing by more than 50% during 2006\u20132008. This rapid increase has \nresulted in demand\u2013supply imbalance.  \n \n6. \nMunicipal  and  county  governments  are  responsible  for  urban  planning,  establishing \nheating  tariffs,  providing  financial  support  to  the  urban  poor  to  pay  heating  bills,  encouraging \nprivate sector participation in the heating sector, and establishing supply contracts with district \nheating companies. Heating reforms are works in progress with significant adjustments in tariffs \nthat are now based on cost recovery plus a margin, and mechanisms are in place to allow tariff \nadjustments  based  on  increases  in  operating  costs.  However,  private  sector  engagement  in \nIMAR\u2019s  heating  sector  has  been  relatively  slow  because  (i)  financial  returns  are  low;  (ii)  initial \ninfrastructure costs are high; (iii) perceived high risks make local financial institutions reluctant \nto provide financing, particularly in remote urban areas with small markets; and (iv) the number \nof  private  companies  with  the  required  technical  and  managerial  capacity  to  operate  such \nutilities is small. The district heating sector is not yet mature enough to survive the withdrawal of \nsupport from the public sector that is required for capacity building and easier access to capital.  \n \n7. \nExisting  district  heating  infrastructure  consists  largely  of  inefficient  neighborhood  coal-\nfired boilers with low capacity and efficiency and an aging and poorly insulated pipe network that \nsuffers  high  distribution  losses.  The  existing  coal-fired  boilers  are  highly  polluting  and  lack \nemission-control  devices.  In  many  urban  areas,  district  heating  systems  were  installed  in  the \n1970s and have exceeded their design lives, resulting in unreliable service. The inadequacy of \nheating in remote areas disproportionately affects the poor.  \n \n8. \nIMAR is a major producer of natural gas, which is widely considered to be the cleanest \nfossil  fuel.6 But  the  consumption  of  natural  gas  as  a  proportion  of  total  energy  consumption  is \nless  than  2.5%,  lower  than  the  national  average.  This  is  primarily  because  natural  gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  is  underdeveloped.  Analysis  of  natural  gas \nconsumption  patterns  in  IMAR  shows  that  natural  gas  is  used  mainly  in  industry,  while \nhousehold  use  accounts  for  only  16.1%  of  the  total.  The  project  will  extend  the  natural  gas \n\n                                                 \n5  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2009.

Assistance  will  construct  more \nefficient  boilers,  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines.  The  government  has \nclassified natural gas for residential use as a priority area for development. Keyouqian Banner \nhas incorporated the supply of natural gas into the design of newly urbanized areas. The project \nwill  enable  the  provision  of  clean  energy  to  the  city  and  boost  economic  development  in \nKeyouqian, which is one of the poorest banners in IMAR.7  \n \n10. \nThe project will avoid coal consumption by 1.04 million tons annually, thereby reducing \nannual  emissions  of  14,070  tons  of  SO2,  15,420  tons  of  TSP,  6,500  tons  of  NOx,  and  1.59 \nmillion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2).  Combined,  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \nEnvironment  Improvement  Project 8 and  the  proposed  project  will  construct  or  rehabilitate  a \ndistrict  heating  area  of  71.49  million  square  meters  (m2)  in  IMAR,  which  is  38.7%  of  the  total \ndistrict heating area of 184.5 million m2 in 2008.9 Together, these projects will improve energy \nefficiency  in  the  district  heating  sector  of  IMAR  by  more  than  15%,  thereby  annually  avoiding \n1.75 million tons of coal consumption and annual emissions of 31,640 tons of SO2, 36,967 tons \nof TSP, 9,218 tons of NOx, and 2.66 million tons of CO2.10 \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010 11 \n11. \nstrategic  pillar  of  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  and  the  Energy  Policy12 \npriority  of  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  protection.  It  supports  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) energy efficiency initiative to expand ADB\u2019s investments in clean energy projects. \nThe project will build on continuing engagement with the Government of IMAR (GIMAR) in the \nenergy  sector.  In  2006,  ADB  approved  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  Environment \nImprovement  Project  for  $120  million  (footnote  8),  which  targeted  district  heating  and  natural \ngas  distribution  in  the  Wuhai  and  Bayannur  municipalities  of  IMAR.  In  June  2010,  ADB \napproved  a  major  change  in  project  scope  for  the  expansion  of  Linhe  district  heating \nsubcomponent, utilizing $48.96 million in unused balance of Loan 2260.13 The project will help \nGIMAR  provide  improved  and  diversified  district  heating  to  a  significant  proportion  of  the \nremaining municipalities in IMAR, including remoter and poorer areas.  \n \n12. \nSome start-up delay was experienced in implementing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion  Environment  Improvement  Project  due  to  (i)  slow  mobilization  of  domestic  loan  funds, \n(ii)  county  governments\u2019  poor  understanding  of  requirements  for  counter  guarantees,  and  (iii) \ndeferment  of  detailed  project  design  until  the  loan  agreement  is  signed.  The  project  has \naddressed these issues by (i) rigorously reviewing the key factors in project readiness that may \n\n                                                 \n7   A banner is an administrative unit essentially equivalent to a county. \n8  ADB.  2006.

Manila \n(Loan 2260-PRC, approved on 29 September, $120 million). \n\n9  The IMAR heating area increased from 52.2 million m2 in 2000 to 184.5 million m2 in 2008 and  was projected to \n\nincrease to 245 million m2 by 2010 and 492 million m2 by 2015. \n\n10 The detailed environmental benefit is in the Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2).  \n11 ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n13 The major variation was necessary due to accelerated implementation of six district heating components ahead of \ntime  without utilizing the ADB loan amount. Similarly, one of the  wastewater treatment facilities became obsolete \nas  the  source  of  the  wastewater  was  forced  to  shut  down  because  it  failed  to  meet  environmental  performance \nrequirements. The expanded Linhe district heating will enlarge coverage to additional 10 million m2 than what was \noriginally envisaged.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe \n\nloan \n\ndelay  start-up;  (ii)  ensuring  that  county  governments  are  fully  aware  of  counter-guarantee \nrequirements;  (iii)  providing  training  on  ADB  procurement  and  disbursement  procedures;  (iv) \ncommencing  detailed  project  design  even  while \nis  being  processed;  and \n(v) encouraging  utilization  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  features.  In \naddition, the project management office is getting involved early in the project design stage to \nensure better coordination between the design institutes and implementing agencies. To further \nensure smooth implementation, especially in the first year, separate capacity-building technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Energy  Efficiency  Improvements  in  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  is \nprovided.14 This  TA  provides  support  in  (i)  capacity  building  and  knowledge  dissemination  for \nimproved energy conservation in the district heating sector and (ii) institutional capacity building \nin project management.  \n \n13. \nGIMAR  will  implement  key  heating  reforms  in  the  project  areas  by  requiring  the \nimplementing  agencies  to  (i) install  radiator  control  valves  in  apartments  to  encourage  heat \nconservation,  and  (ii) use  heat-measuring  devices  and  consumption-based  billing  systems  so \nthat charges will be based on actual heat consumption. These reforms will enable consumers to \nregulate the amount of heat they consume, which is essential if tariff-based incentives for heat \nconservation, insulation installation, and heat-loss reduction are to work. \n \n14. \nAlthough the heating sector\u2019s high growth rate provides significant opportunity for private \nsector  participation,  a  number  of  barriers  exist  (para.  6).  Considering  the  importance  of \naffordable and reliable heating during winter, GIMAR plans initially to support interested private \ncompanies, thus allowing them to strengthen their technical, financial, and managerial capacity \nand  reach  economies  of  scale.  The  project  will  provide  financial  assistance  to  two  100% \nprivately  owned  district  heating  companies  and  two  partly  privatized  companies  to  expand \noperations  in  remote  urban  areas,  thereby  contributing  to  economies  of  scale  and  improved \ncommercial performance.  \n \nB. \n \n15. \nproject will be improved air quality in six urban areas in IMAR.   \n \nC. \n \n16. \ntransmission and distribution, as summarized below. \n \n17. \nOutput A: District heating supply.

The  government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n21. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  45%  of  total  project  costs.  The  remaining  $183.02  million \n(55%)  will  be  financed  by  implementing  agency  equity  (35.5%)  and  domestic  bank  loans \n(19.5%). Implementing agency equity includes internally generated funds from parent company \nor  local  government  contributions.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  used  for  civil  works,  equipment  and \nsupplies, consulting services, interest, and commitment charges during construction on the ADB \nloan, and including taxes and duties estimated to be $9.93 million on the ADB financed portion \nof the project costs. ADB's decision to finance the taxes and duties was based on the analysis \nthat the amount of taxes and duties does not constitute an excessive share of the project cost \nand it is material to the success of the project. The government will finance contingencies and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.

Financial \n24. \nanalyses of the subprojects indicate FIRRs of between 7.0% and 9.2%, which for each case is \nhigher  than  the  specific  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  FIRR  for  the  whole  project  is \n7.6%,  more  than  double  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.6%.  Sensitivity  analysis \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\fshows that the FIRR of the whole project would decrease to (i) 6.4% if there were a cost overrun \nof 10%; (ii) 4.5% if revenue decreased by 10%; (iii) 5.5% if major operating costs increased by \n10%; (iv) 7.4% if there were a 1-year delay in construction; and (v) 3.9% if (i), (iii), and (iv) were \nall  to  occur.  The  project  is  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshows that the project is likely to be sustainable under various adverse scenarios. \n \n25. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  district  heating  supply  include  improvements  in  heating \nefficiency  and  to  the  environment.  The  economic  benefits  of  natural  gas  supply  derive  from \nimprovements to the environment. The calculations reflect all project-related costs, benefits from \ncost  savings  from  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvements,  and  local  and  global \nenvironmental benefits. Analyses for each subproject indicate economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs) ranging from 14.1% to 34.8%. The EIRR of the whole project is 27.6%, which is more \nthan double the 12% economic cost of capital. Therefore, the project is economically feasible. \nSensitivity  analysis  for  each  subproject  indicated  that  a  10%  benefit  decrease  would  lower \nEIRRs  for  the  subprojects  to  between  12.7%  and  32.3%,  still  exceeding  the  economic  cost  of \ncapital. The analysis indicated that a 10% cost increase would reduce EIRRs for the subprojects \nto  between  10.1%  and  28.2%,  with  three  subprojects  having  EIRRs  marginally  lower  than  the \neconomic  cost  of  capital.  This  is  considered  acceptable  and  would  not  affect  the  project\u2019s \nviability.  Should  the  project  encounter  a  1-year  delay  in  commissioning,  the  EIRR  for  the \nsubprojects would fall to between 12.4% and 29.7%, which would not affect project viability. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  and  national \nconsultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with simplified technical proposal (quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20).  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  GIMAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n28. \nThe project will improve public health by reducing urban air pollution with the closure of \nsmall, inner-city boilers, installation of more efficient heating boilers, reduced use of household \nstoves,  and  reduced  coal  truck  traffic  through  urban  areas.  Improvements  in  air  quality  will \nindirectly benefit the entire urban population of about 2.28 million residing in the six subproject \nareas, and particularly the 78,100 poor residents, or 3.4% of the total. Access to reliable district \nheating and natural gas will improve the standard of living. By 2015, it is expected that 786,200 \nurban residents will benefit directly from improved district heating and natural gas supply as a \nresult  of  the  project,  and  a  further  680,500  urban  residents  will  benefit  from  the  improved \ninfrastructure.  The  increased  use  of  natural  gas  and  improved  district  heating  will  reduce  the \nuse of such fuels as raw coal, wood, and coal briquettes for indoor heating and cooking, which \nwill  benefit  public  health,  particularly  for  the  poor  and  women  who  spend  most  of  their  time \nindoors, as well as reduce the labor needed to acquire and burn fuel. The project will eliminate \n1,229 jobs with the closure of small boilers. The survey of affected workers indicated that 30% \nof  them  were  former  employees  of  the  heating  companies  and  the  remainder  were  migrant \nworkers  with  contracts  for  a  single  heating  season.  A  labor-restructuring  plan  has  been \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nprepared  to  cover  the  affected  workers.18 The  implementing  agencies  have  agreed  to  ensure \nthat all permanent employees affected by the closure of the small boilers under the project are \nreemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the project labor-restructuring plan.  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory  B,  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The  project  has  substantial  environmental \nbenefits  resulting  from  energy  efficiency  improvements  and  reductions  in  emissions  from  coal \nburning. The project will (i) close small, inner-city coal-fired boilers; (ii) replace household coal-\nfired stoves; (iii) stop the transportation of coal through urban areas; (iv) substantially improve \nlocal  air  quality  through  reduced  emissions  of  SO2,  TSP,  and  NOx;  (v)  provide  a  global  public \ngood by reducing emissions of CO2; and (vi) support the utilization of industrial waste heat. The \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  from  the  project  include  (i)  soil  erosion  during \nconstruction,  (ii)  increased  noise  and  dust  affecting  local  residents  during  construction, \n(iii) inappropriate  storage  of  hazardous  materials  and  wastes  during  operation,  and \n(iv) increased  gas  emissions  during  operation.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination \nconcluded  that  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  by \nfunding appropriate mitigation measures.19 \n \nThe project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples \n30. \ncategory  C.  One  of  the  seven  subprojects,  Zhalaite  District  Heating  Supply  (DHS),  will  affect \npeople  through  land  acquisition.  The  remaining  subprojects  have  no  resettlement,  as  they  will \nbe  implemented  on  government-reserved  land  or  existing  premises.  For  Zhalaite  DHS,  the \nexpansion  of  the  existing  facilities  will  require  (i)  1.1  hectares  of  government-owned  land \ncurrently used by two private entities, a driving school and a closed factory, and (ii) 1,740 m2 of \noffice  and  factory  buildings  of  these  entities.  A  short  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for \nthe Zhalaite DHS subproject.20 \n \n31. \nThe resettlement objective is to achieve  equal or better income and living standards in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Consultations  with  the  two  entities \naffected by Zhalaite DHS revealed that they prefer cash compensation for losing land-use rights \nand  structures.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  leasing  is  CNY3.54  million  for \nZhalaite DHS, including compensation for land-use rights, nonresidential buildings, other assets, \nmoving allowances, administration and internal monitoring, and contingencies.  \n \nE. \n \n32.
