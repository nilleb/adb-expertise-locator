It is expected to enhance RCI in the Shan border province of Myanmar by \nproviding benefits to Myanmar nationals who trade, work, and use social services in the project \ncounties. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRemote location and high poverty levels. Lincang Prefecture is situated in the remote \nsouthwest  region  of  Yunnan  Province  on  the  border  with  Myanmar,  and  is  characterized  by \nsignificant urban and rural poverty. Per capita gross domestic product in the prefecture reached \nCNY21,967  in  2016  up  10.6%  over  2015,  however  the  annual  disposable  income  of  urban \nresidents was CNY22,901 per capita, well below the PRC average. The counties of Cangyuan \nWa and Zhenkang are officially designated as national poverty counties, and are home to a large \nshare of the prefecture\u2019s urban poor. Many Myanmar nationals live and work in these counties, \nwhich  are  located  on  the  PRC\u2013Myanmar  border.  Most  are  seasonal  workers  who  increasingly \nsecure  manual  jobs  in  factories  established  near  the  land  ports  and  border  cities  of  Lincang \nPrefecture. Many people from Myanmar use hospitals and schools in the three project counties \nin preference to the poor municipal services available in Myanmar. Most of the seasonal workers \nbelong to ethnic minorities, which account for a significant proportion of the population in the three \ncounties: 93.9% in Cangyuan Wa County (Wa is the major ethnic group), 52.2% in Gengma Dai \nand Wa County, and 31.5% in Zhenkang County. \n \n4. \nRegional  cooperation  and  integration  potential.  Lincang  Prefecture\u2019s  location  and  \n300 kilometer (km) border with Myanmar provide the potential for it to become an important trade \ngateway by which the PRC can reach key Indian Ocean ports, and thereby facilitate access to \nSouth Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Lincang Prefecture complements other border regions \nof  Yunnan  by  enabling  the  growing  trade  between  the  PRC  and  Myanmar,  which  reached  \n$9.7 billion in 2015, up from $3.6 billion in 2010. Much of the trade originates at the local level, \nand is conducted largely by private sector small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In May \n2017,  the  ministries  of  commerce  of  the  PRC  and  Myanmar  signed  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  for  the  joint  development  of  border  economic  cooperation  zones.  Lincang \nPrefecture\u2019s  comparative  advantage  is  its  location\u2014along  the  shortest  route  from  Kunming  to \nMyanmar\u2019s Kyaukpyu Port, on the Bay of Bengal. Yunnan\u2019s economic and social development \nstrategies have highlighted the potential for the border areas of Lincang Prefecture to become an \nimportant manufacturing and logistics hub along an economic corridor currently being developed \nthrough  major  investment  projects  such  as  the  Kunming\u2013Mandalay  highway  and  the  freight \nrailway linking Kunming to Kyaukpyu. \n \n5. \nlow \ncompetitiveness of its second- and third-tier cities are hindering the enhancement of cross-border \n\nDevelopment  needs.  Lincang  Prefecture\u2019s  poor \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nthe \n\n\ftrade,  and  the  achievement  of  sustainable  economic  and  social  development.  The  existing \ncustoms and quarantine inspection facilities at Qingshuihe, the prefecture\u2019s main land port, are \ninadequate  to  handle  the  border  crossing  point\u2019s  growing  trade  volume.  Further,  the  current \ntrading market area and warehouses are outdated and in poor condition, affecting the quality of \nlogistical  services  provided  to  local  traders  and  SMEs.  A  similar  situation  exists  in  the  town \nsupporting the land port. Qingshuihe\u2019s urban road network is inadequate for current residential \nand  commercial  needs  and  the  lack  of  road  capacity  makes  urban  areas  difficult  to  access, \ncausing economic losses and safety concerns for road users and pedestrians. Access to basic \nutilities  is  limited\u201426%  of  households  lack  access  to  clean  piped  water  and  29%  are  not \nconnected to the sewerage system. Municipal solid waste (MSW) management capacity is limited, \nsorting  facilities  are  lacking,  and  collection  systems  are  basic,  resulting  in  considerable \nenvironmental pollution and general nuisance. Qingshuihe is crossed by the Nanting River, which \nlacks  flood  alleviation  infrastructure;  some  areas  experience  seasonal  flooding,  causing \nsignificant economic losses. Limited customs and logistical facilities in the city and its land port \ninhibit the activity of local enterprises and traders, slowing the flow of goods across the border. In \naddition, the prefecture's border counties of Cangyuan Wa, Gengma Dai and Wa, and Zhenkang \nhave  outdated  social  services  (e.g.,  schools  and  hospitals),  and  are  unable  to  serve  growing \npopulations of local urban\u2013rural residents, and of Myanmar migrants. \n \n6. \nLincang Border Economic Cooperation Zone. As a first step in addressing constraints \nto  cross-border  trade,  as  well  as  economic  and  social  development  in  Lincang  Prefecture,  on  \n23  September  2013  the  PRC\u2019s  State  Council  approved  the  establishment  of  a  national-level \nborder economic cooperation zone that aims to (i) eliminate bottlenecks created by inadequate \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  promote  cross-border  trade  and  investment  to  improve  living  conditions  of \nresidents, (iii) promote sustainable regional economic and social development, and (iv) strengthen \nneighborly cooperation with Myanmar. The Lincang Border Economic Cooperation Zone (LBECZ) \nis comprised of several core industrial zones covering 3.47 square kilometers and located in the \ncounties of Cangyuan Wa, Gengma Dai and Wa, and Zhenkang (including a tier 1 national port \nin  Qingshuihe).  To  boost  socioeconomic  benefits,  the  LBECZ  Management  Committee  has \ndevised plans to develop 200 square kilometers of adjacent land in State Council-approved core \nindustrial  zones,  which  will  provide  complementary  commercial  and  residential  development \nareas; and additional industrial, logistics, and trading capacity. In light of the security situation in \nMyanmar, the LBECZ is instrumental in building cooperation dialogue with authorities in Myanmar \n(nationally and in Shan State) to enhance the development of the economic corridor beyond the \nPRC. \n \nStrategic fit. The development of the LBECZ is supported by the national and provincial \n7. \nstrategic frameworks for urban development and RCI. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for \nNational  Economic  and  Social  Development,  2016\u20132020  and \nthe  National  New-Type \nUrbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 both call for the development of small and medium-sized urban \ncenters  in  key  strategic  border  areas  of  the  PRC,  and  establishment  of  border  economic \ncooperation  zones. 1 Similar  focus  for  the  PRC  is  the  development  of  border  areas  and  the \nenhancement  of  cross-border  cooperation  to  promote  connectivity  and  strengthen  economic \npartnerships in the spirit of open regionalism. Additionally, RCI constitutes an important means to \nincrease integration with the regional and global economy, and is highlighted as a priority in the \nThirteenth  Five-Year  Plan. In  2016, the  State  Council  approved  a  list  of key  border  areas  and \ntrade ports, and identified actions for their development, while the governments of the PRC and \n\n                                                \n1  Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2016.

Beijing. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fMyanmar  began  an  ambitious  cooperation  program  in  2014  intended  to  develop  a  \u201cPRC\u2013\nMyanmar corridor\u201d from Kunming to the sea port of Kyaukpyu, in which the LBECZ plays a key \nrole. The corridor includes highway and railway links, as well as key urban and logistic centers. \nMany sections of the corridor in both countries are already under construction, with others in the \nplanning and design stage. \n  \n8. \nUrban development and RCI are integral to Yunnan Province\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \nwhich emphasizes (i) strengthening cooperation with the GMS countries, (ii) participating in major \ninternational economic corridors linking Yunnan and the GMS, and (iii) serving as the gateway for \nthe PRC\u2019s southeast region.2 However, Yunnan Province is constrained by its low urbanization \nrate; despite rapid development in the Kunming area, many of the province\u2019s small and medium-\nsized  cities  suffer  from  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  limited  connectivity.  Through  the \nGMS, Yunnan has been prioritizing the development of economic corridors, while highlighting the \nimportance  of  cross-border  cooperation  as  a  way  to  enhance  the  benefits  for  neighboring \ncountries,  particularly  Myanmar.  Yunnan\u2019s  RCI  action  plan  includes  priority  investments  for \ndevelopment of the PRC\u2013Myanmar corridor through Lincang Prefecture, which are intended for \nfinancing  by  various  sources,  including  the  PRC  and  Yunnan  governments,  multilateral \ndevelopment banks, and the private sector. \n \n9. \nThe project (i) supports Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in making \ncities more livable, fostering RCI, and accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) is in line with \n(a) ADB\u2019s urban and water operational plans by promoting green, competitive, and inclusive cities; \nand (b) ADB\u2019s operational plan for RCI by strengthening connectivity between economies; (iii) is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 in terms of facilitating \ninclusive urbanization and enhancing RCI; (iv) is included in the country operations business plan \nfor the PRC, 2018\u20132020, which references inclusive development of small cities; (v) is aligned \nwith the latest strategic priorities of the GMS, and (vi) is in support of the achievement of several \nsustainable  development  goals  of  the  United  Nations  related  to  health,  education,  sanitation, \neconomic growth, and sustainable cities.3 \n \n10. \nContinuity  of  development  initiatives  and  lessons  learned.  The  project  is  part  of \nADB\u2019s  continuous  engagement  to  assist  Yunnan  in  achieving  green  and  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment, and support the PRC in enhancing RCI. The project design incorporates lessons \nlearned from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in Yunnan, as well as in small \nand  medium-sized  cities  in  the  PRC.  These  lessons  include  enhanced  implementation \narrangements with integral capacity support from the Yunnan provincial authorities and improved \ndesign of project components in order to further support urban\u2013rural integration. The project will \nalso  build  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  from  recent  urban  development  and  RCI  projects  in  strategic \nborder areas of the PRC on key issues such as construction and management of logistics and \nindustrial parks and on the role of cross-border migrant workers.4 \n \n\n                                                \n2   Government  of  Yunnan  Province,  State  Council.  2016.

By  designing  a  multisector  project  that  includes \n11. \nurban, social, and trading infrastructure, ADB has strengthened a holistic approach that enhances \ncompetitive, green, and inclusive development in the small and medium-sized urban centers of \nthis border region. The project is thus aligned with the livable cities vision endorsed by both the \nPRC  and  ADB.  Throughout  the  project  implementation,  ADB  will  provide  recommendations  to \nLBECZ regarding their master plan review process to introduce best practices in urban planning \nand  development.  Although  the  project  is  being  implemented  entirely  in  the  PRC,  ADB  has \nensured cross-border spillover effects by designing each component so that Myanmar nationals \nwill also be beneficiaries. This is particularly the case for (i) trading markets and logistics parks, \nwhich will accommodate farmers and traders from Myanmar; and (ii) schools and hospitals, which \nwill benefit large numbers of children and other family members from Myanmar. Output 4 of the \nproject  (on \nthe \ninfrastructure components, thereby enhancing their RCI impact. Some of these features, such as \nthose  focusing  on  SMEs  and  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET),  will  be \ndesigned to enhance the capacity of entrepreneurs and workers from Myanmar. The project will \nalso be effectively mainstreaming gender equality through its social infrastructure and services \ncomponents.  For  instance,  the  hospitals  will  have  specialized  maternity  and  obstetrics  and \ngynecology departments promoting safe motherhood and women\u2019s reproductive health, and the \nschools will have gender-inclusive design features and will be staffed by at least 60% women. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) economic growth potential for LBECZ \nand  border  areas  of  Myanmar  enhanced;  (ii)  benefits  of  RCI  in  LBECZ  and  border  areas  of \nMyanmar realized; and (iii) living conditions and public health of residents of LBECZ and border \nareas  of  Myanmar  improved  (footnote  1).

Climate change adaptation measures were incorporated based \non climate risk and vulnerability assessments. The capacity-building components were based on \na  needs  assessment  for  the  successful  implementation  and  operation  of  project  facilities.  The \nPMO  will  provide  funding  and  a  mechanism  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  for  all \ninfrastructure to be developed under the project. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic analysis. The economic analysis prepared for the overall project and individual \nsubprojects concluded the project is economically viable.10 The base case economic internal rate \nof return for the entire project is 12.5%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital. \nCalculation  of the  project\u2019s  economic  benefits  considered  (i) willingness  to  pay  for  incremental \nwater supply, wastewater treatment, and improved solid waste collection and treatment services; \n(ii)  avoided  losses  and  improved  amenity  associated  with  the  river  rehabilitation  subproject;  \n(iii) welfare gains through increased production of agricultural and industrial products, and trade \nmarket and international cooperation zone cost savings for border residents; (iv) time savings, \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings,  and  accident  reduction  for  Qingshuihe  border  infrastructure \nsubproject;  and  (v)  human  resource  returns  associated  with  education  facilities  and  disability-\nadjusted  life-year  values  for  hospital  subprojects.  Economic  costs  comprise  capital  costs, \nincluding physical contingencies and O&M costs. \n \n24. \nFinancial analysis. A financial analysis has been undertaken to establish the project\u2019s \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability. 11 For  the  three  revenue-generating  subprojects,  financial \nviability assessment was based on the comparison between the projected real financial internal \nrate  of  return  and  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital;  the  water  subproject  is  assessed  as \nfinancially viable as its projected financial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average \ncost  of  capital.  The  financial  sustainability  assessment  indicates  that  the  project  county \ngovernments have sufficient funds to pay the debt service and O&M costs during operation, given \nthat  the  higher-level  (provincial  and  federal)  governments  are  expected  to  continue  providing \nadequate  budget  allocations,  however  reliance  on  these  allocations  poses  a  risk  to  financial \nsustainability. A policy dialogue with LMG on water tariff systems to meet the PRC regulations \nand improve project sustainability is to be undertaken during implementation.12 \n \nC. \n \n25. \nA  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for  LMG  and  the  implementing \nagencies.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  the  (i)  PMO  and \nimplementing  agencies  are  unfamiliar  with  ADB  financial  management  policy  and  procedures, \nincluding  annual  project  reporting;  and  (ii)  implementing  agencies  lack  accounting  staff for  the \nreview procedure. These risks will be mitigated by contracting with financial specialists as part of \nthe project implementation consultants. A procurement capacity assessment concluded that the \noverall procurement risk for the project is moderate. The project is not the first externally financed \ndevelopment project in Yunnan. However, it is the first for LMG and the implementing agencies. \nIt was confirmed that LMG  will receive advice and support from other agencies of the Yunnan \nprovincial  government  with  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  Mitigation  measures \nagreed with LMG have been incorporated into the project design, and will be closely monitored \nduring project implementation as specified in the PAM. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  LMG,  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n10  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 In a recent regulatory decree issued by the State Council, the Government of the PRC has made it clear that tariffs \n\nfor water, wastewater, and solid waste must be revised to realize cost recovery by no later than 2025. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n27. \nA poverty, social, and gender analysis was carried out to assess the impacts of the project \non  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  and  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  social  development \naction  plan  have  been  prepared,  and  their  implementation  will  be  monitored. 13  There  are  \n288,924 project direct beneficiaries, of which 47.37% (136,851) are women; 42.80% (123,650) \nare minority beneficiaries; and 6.59% (19,037) are poor. The project will enhance regional social \ninclusiveness because Myanmar border residents will enjoy improved public facilities and social \nservices  in  the  three  project  counties,  and  share  the  benefits  from  cross-border  trade \ndevelopment. Two of the project counties are national poverty counties\u2014poverty ratios in 2016 \nwere 18.5% in Cangyuan Wa and 8.2% in Zhenkang\u2014much higher than the 5.05% average of \nLincang. Lack of public infrastructure and social facilities, low education levels, low agricultural \nproductivity, and lack of industrial competitiveness are key factors causing poverty in the project \nareas. The project will positively impact poor people, who will benefit from improved infrastructure \nand social services, increased business opportunities, and economic development. A rapid health \nimpact assessment identified health risks from both vector-borne and lifestyle-related diseases, \nand the need for expanded health services for local and migrant populations. Implementation of \na  public  health  management  plan  (to  complement  the  hospital  subproject)  using  technical \nassistance resources is being explored. \n \nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  will  significantly  benefit \n28. \nwomen, who are primarily responsible for water collection and conservation, wastewater and solid \nwaste disposal and management, and related household activities. Women use public transport \nmore  than  men,  and  consider  traffic  safety  and  public  transport  access  improvements  as \nimportant benefits that will enhance their quality of life. The GAP will (i) ensure job opportunities \nfor  women  during  construction  and  operation  (30%);  (ii)  ensure  gender-responsive  physical \ndesign  features  in  the  project;  (iii)  enhance  opportunities  for  women  through  capacity \ndevelopment  (i.e.,  development  of  SMEs  and  TVET);  and  (iv)  support  women\u2019s  equitable \nparticipation in all project-related public consultations (50%). Social and gender specialists will be \nhired to ensure the effective implementation of the GAP. \n \nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  categorization  was  based  on  the  project  having \n30. \nnumerous  multisector  components  and  potential  accumulative  impacts  to  the  project  area.  An \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  including  an  EMP  was  finalized  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 25 May 2018. The EIA \nincorporates  findings  of  the  domestic  feasibility  studies,  domestic  EIAs,  climate  risk  and \nvulnerability assessment, and technical reports conducted. The domestic EIAs were approved by \nthe  local  environmental  protection  bureau  in  March  2018.  The  EMP  complies  with  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An external monitoring entity will be \nrecruited  by  the  PMO  to  perform  evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  implementation  and \ncompliance with the EMP during all stages of the project. During project preparation, two rounds \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n13 The analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB. 2012. Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. Manila; and \nADB.  2012.  Guidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects.  Manlia.  Gender  Action  Plan \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fof meaningful consultations have been conducted with all relevant stakeholders, and the findings \nwere incorporated in the project design. Any potential environmental disputes will be handled in \naccordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  established  for  the  project.  Mitigation \nmeasures  identified  in  the  EMP  require  environmental  compliance  for  air  pollution,  water \ntreatment, MSW, and hospital and industrial wastes. An assessment to determine the significance \nof  project  impacts  on  and  risks  to  biodiversity  and  natural  resources  has  been  conducted. \nParticular  attention  has  been  given  to  the  potential  impact  on  extractive  commercial  activity  in \nMyanmar  derived  from  enhanced  border  trade.  The  project  includes  specific  capacity-building \nmeasures to address this important issue. \n \n31. \nClimate  change  assessment.  Construction  sites  are  vulnerable  to  floods  and  intense \nprecipitation. The project sites should be designed with surface water interceptors and other flood \ncontrol structures to capture drainage. Supply of water to construction sites should be secured \nduring  droughts.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  cutting  of  rubber  trees  in  collective  land \nacquired for project implementation, and carbon dioxide sequestration compensation will be built \nin. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). There are 145 households (766 persons) who \nwill be affected by the acquisition of collective farmland (1,038.37 mu) in the Mengding subproject; \n28 households (110 persons) belong to the Wa and Yi ethnic groups.15 The impacts are found to \nbe insignificant because the loss of land per household is less than 5% of their total landholdings \nand  households  have  other  sources  of  income. For the  Cangyuan subproject,  the  impacts  are \nfound to be marginal, as four households (20 persons) will lose about 7.65 mu of cultivated land, \nwhile one household (4 persons) will be affected by house demolition. These five households are \nfrom  the  Wa  and  Dai  ethnic  group.  Impacts  are  also  found  to  be  marginal  for  the  Zhenkang \nsubproject,  where  the  loss  of  an  estimated  38.24  mu  of  collective  land  will  be  affecting  nine \nhouseholds (41 persons) from the De\u2019ang ethnic group. An estimated 125 mu of unallocated state-\nowned rubber forest land in Mengding and a 39.53 mu of state-owned construction land owned \nby a real estate company in Cangyuan will be required. For Zhenkang, where 85.26 mu of state-\nowned  construction  land  was  acquired  in  the  past,  due  diligence  indicated  that  there  are  no \noutstanding issues. There are three resettlement plans that have been prepared in consultation \nwith the affected persons and various stakeholders to address land acquisition and resettlement \nissues. Key information in the resettlement plans has been disclosed to the affected persons. \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  ethnic  population  makes  up  42.8%  of  project \nbeneficiaries. Among ethnic minority beneficiaries, Dai, De\u2019ang, Wa, and Yi minorities comprise \n83.57% of the total.
