In order to meet this load growth, the \nGovernment has decided to construct a 500-kilovolt (kV) ring \nmain transmission system around the major load centers in the \nnorth covering Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh. The proposed \nsector project is part of this expansion program. The Project has \ntwo major components\u2014Part A: expansion and upgrading of the \n500 kV and 220 kV transmission systems, and Part B: upgrading \nand expansion of the supervisory control and data acquisition \nsystem, plus communications facilities at the north, central, and \nsouth  regional  centers  and  the  national  load  dispatch  center \n(NLDC) in Hanoi. \n   \nRationale  The proposed project will strengthen the northern power system \nof Viet Nam so as to enable power transmission with adequate \nreliability and quality from new plants under construction and \nadditional  generating  capacity  programmed  over  the  next  5 \nyears.  Through  its  loan  covenants,  the  proposed  project  will \nfurther the ongoing power sector reforms to restructure Electricity \nof Vietnam (EVN) and thereby create a profitable and viable \nelectricity supply industry in Viet Nam. \n   \nObjectives  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) directly expand and \nstrengthen EVN\u2019s transmission system in the north to improve \nsystem  reliability  and  quality,  and  (ii) indirectly  improve  the \nefficiency of the power sector by promoting restructuring and \ncommercialization of EVN. ADB\u2019s programmed interventions in \nthe sector during 2004\u20132007 will support the power sector reform \nefforts  aimed  at  establishing  a  \u201csingle-buyer\u201d  power  market \nstructure and transparent regulation of the sector by 2009. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $273.6 million  inclusive  of \nphysical  and  price  contingencies  and  financial  charges \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $174.6 million and local \ncurrency cost of $99.0 million equivalent. \n   ", "iii \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nFinancing Source  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency \nADB  119.7  0.3  120.0  43.8 \nAFD  50.0    50.0  18.3 \nEVN Counterpart  4.9  98.7  103.6  37.9 \nFunding \n         \n  Total Project Cost       174.6  99.0  273.6  100 \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nEVN = Electricity of Vietnam. \nSource: Staff Appraisal. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $120,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Viet Nam will act as the Borrower for the \nTerms  ADB loan and the loan proceeds will be re-lent to the Executing \nAgency\u2014EVN\u2014on terms acceptable to ADB and at the ADB\u2019s \ninterest rate applicable to ordinary capital resources loans plus \nan onlending fee, currently set at 0.2% per annum. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented using a sector loan approach. A \nArrangements  total of 11 subprojects have been appraised. The subprojects \nthat have not yet been appraised will be submitted for ADB\u2019s \napproval  during  the  implementation  stage.  EVN  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning,  designing,  contracting,  testing,  and \ncommissioning  the  subprojects.  For  each  subproject  not  yet \nappraised, EVN will submit an appraisal report together with an \ninitial environmental examination report to ADB for approval. \n \nThe Project will use two units of EVN as project implementing \nagencies,  namely,  the  Northern  Power  Project  Management \nBoard  (NPPMB)  and  NLDC.  NPPMB  will  be  responsible  for \n500 kV and 220 kV substations and transmission lines upgrading \nand construction, and NLDC will be responsible for upgrading of \nthe  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system, \ncommunication, and load dispatch facilities. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Electricity of Vietnam \n   ", "iv \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services for the Project will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  the  ADB Guidelines for Procurement. \nSupply  of  materials  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB), international shopping (IS), or direct \npurchase.  Civil  works  will  be  financed  out  of  EVN\u2019s  own \nresources and will be carried out using NPPMB\u2019s own labor force \nand  local  contractors  through  its  own  competitive  bidding \nprocess. The materials required for the Project will be grouped \ninto packages suitable for ICB, IS, or direct purchase.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants are required to be financed under the loan for the \nfollowing:  (i) international  consultants  to  assist  NLDC  in \ncommissioning  hardware  and  software  upgrades  for  load \ndispatch  centers;  (ii) international  resettlement  consultants  to \nassist NPPMB in implementing the resettlement plan; and (iii) \ndomestic  resettlement  consultants  for  monitoring  the \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plan.  The  international \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  individually  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the domestic \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  EVN/NPPMB  following \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. The Government requested \nadvance action for recruitment of consultants to minimize front-\nend  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  approved  early \nrecruitment action, and informed the Government that this action \nwould not in any way commit ADB to finance the consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Adequate  supply  of  power  to  industry  and  commercial \nBeneficiaries  consumers will enable expansion of these sectors and promote \noff-farm  employment  opportunities.  Off-farm  employment \nopportunities will enable more stable income sources to rural \nhouseholds.  Economic  growth  and  structural  change  of  the \neconomy  are  key  elements  in  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nreduce poverty and to distribute the benefits of growth, including \ntargeting vulnerable areas and groups. The investment program \nyields a high economic rate of return of 40%. \n   ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  project \ndepends  on  the  implementation  of  the  other  components  of \npower  system  expansion  in  northern  Viet  Nam.  These  also \ninclude significant investments in new power generation capacity \nas  well  as  transmission  capacity  outside  the  scope  of  the \nproposed Project. The mobilizing of these investments requires \nconcerted efforts by EVN and other public sector investors as \nwell  as  the  private  sector  financing  and  in  successfully \nimplementing these projects. It is expected that EVN and the \nGovernment will create the enabling environment by removing \nentry  barriers  for  private  sector  participation  (domestic  and \nforeign) through proposed power sector reforms. \n \nA key potential concern is the failure of the economy to continue \nachieving its assumed high economic growth rate of 7%. A lower \nrate of growth would reduce the rate of growth in electricity \ndemand. However, the analysis of risks shows that the economic \nviability  of  the  investment  program  can  withstand  extreme \nadverse changes in anticipated economic growth, and in other \nkey risk factors and assumptions. \n   \n ", "vii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Northern Power Transmission Sector Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Introduction \n \n2.  Pro-poor growth is a main component of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for \nreducing income poverty according to the Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program (CSP) \n(2002-2004). The CSP endorsed by the ADB Board in January 2002 emphasized the role of \nprivate sector development, agricultural productivity, financial sector reform, and small and \nmedium  enterprise  development  to  achieve  such  growth.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS)1 of Viet Nam aims to combine high and sustainable \neconomic growth accompanied by targeted measures to create favorable opportunities for the \npoor to improve their living standards, as financed through the redistribution of the fruits of \ngrowth. This approach has proven successful in the last decade. The rapid economic growth of \nover  7.5%  has  contributed  to  bringing  down  the  proportion  of  the  population  below  the \ninternational poverty line from 58% in 1993 to less than 29% in 2002; the CPRGS target is for a \nfurther reduction to 24% by 2010.  \n \n3.  The  critical  role  of  large-scale infrastructure in achieving poverty reduction through \ngrowth is underlined in a new chapter of the CPRGS approved by the Prime Minister of Viet \nNam on 26 November 2003. The new chapter stresses the direct and indirect impact of \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, increasing efficiency, and generating the growth and employment that \nwill directly reduce poverty and indirectly allow redistributive programs to be financed.  ADB  \nconsiders  ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending to  Viet Nam as a means of meeting the \nsignificant financing gap it faces in the infrastructure sector. The 2005-2006 Country Strategy \nand Program Update (CSPU) provided an initial response to these changed circumstances by \ndeveloping an expanded OCR lending program focused on the power and transport sectors.  \n \n4.  The power sector is a key sector for achieving the 7% average growth target up to 2010, \nwhich will require the share of the industry sector to increase from 37% in 2000 to 41% in 2010. \nThe industry and services sectors are expected to maintain above average growth rates of \n10.5% and 8%, respectively, up to 2010 and this is forecast to result in a 13% growth rate over \nthe same period in demand for electricity. As electricity is an underlying input for economic \ngrowth and job creation, any shortage of power will result in a slowing of the economy and \nunderachievement in poverty reduction targets. \n \n5.  As a result of high sustainable economic growth and low initial consumption levels over \nthe last decade, the demand for power has been growing at an average rate of 14% per annum. \nAccording to the Master Plan for Power Development for Viet Nam, 2001\u20132010 (Fifth Master \nPlan),2 annual ni vestments of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion  are  required  to  increase  electricity \nsupplies sufficiently to support the Government\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) projections. \n                                                 \n1  Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, Government of Viet Nam, May 2002 \n2  Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, June 2000. ", "2 \nThe Fifth Master Plan Adjustment File (MP5 AF)3 states that the total investment requirement of \nthe power sector for the period 2002\u20132010 is estimated to be $19.1 billion, consisting of \n$11.8 billion for generation and $7.3 billion for transmission and distribution. Given the huge \ninvestment needs of the sector, it is envisaged that the non-Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) \ninvestments in the sector,4 including those from the private sector, will amount to $3.0 billion and \nthat these investments will be mainly in the generation sector. The investments to be mobilized \nby EVN would be $16.1 billion and the internal cash generation of EVN would contribute more \nthan half (i.e., $8.9 billion) with modest tariff increases.5 The financing gap of $7.2 billion is \nexpected to be filled through borrowings. The official development assistance (ODA) flows to \nthe sector are expected to be $3 billion\u20133.5 billion and the balance would be sourced from \ncommercial borrowings. The domestic banks and export credit agencies are financing several \npower generation projects and this trend is expected to continue in the future as EVN\u2019s credit \nworthiness improves. \n \n6.  Recognizing its fiscal constraints to meet all investment demands, the Government \nrequested assistance from ADB to upgrade its power transmission network in the northern part \nof  the  country.  The  Government\u2019s  request  was  included  in  the  1999  CSP  and  a  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA)6 was approved in 2002. An ADB appraisal mission \nvisited Viet Nam in August 2004 and this report is based on the agreements reached during the \nmission. \n \n2.  Power System \n \n7.  EVN has the legal status of a state corporation under the state enterprise law and \nincludes 15 generation companies,7 4 transmission companies, 7 distribution companies\u2014i.e., \nthe \u201cpower companies\u201d (PCs)8 and the national load dispatch center (NLDC) as core member \nunits. In its current organizational structure, the generation and transmission companies are \nclassified as dependent units of EVN, while the power companies are considered independent \nentities (i.e., quasi profit centers). EVN is engaged in generation and transmission (500 kV to \n110 kV). The seven regionally located power companies purchase bulk power from EVN and \ndistribute it at 35 kV and below. The Ministry of Industry is responsible for policy and oversight \nof the power sector. EVN is vested with all operating and management responsibilities for the \npower sector. \n \n8.  The total electricity demand and the total electricity sales reached 7,366 megawatt (MW) \nand 34,841 gigawatt-hours (GWh), respectively in 2003. This shows a marked improvement \nduring the period 1995\u20132003 when EVN energy sales increased by more than threefold (i.e., \n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, October 2002. \n4  The bulk of these investments would be mobilized by other state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as Vina Coal and \nPetro Vietnam (there are already more than 1,000 MW of thermal power plants financed by Vina Coal and Petro \nVietnam under construction). The private investments in the sector at present are limited to Phu My 2.2 and Phy \nMy 3 (i.e., total investment of approximately $1.0 billion) and the proposed sector reforms are expected to result in \nincreased private investment. \n5  Financial projections of EVN, Appendix 8. \n6  ADB. 2002.

Manila (TA 4051-VIE, approved on 18 December 2002 for $700,000). \n7  EVN, in addition, has a number of noncore member units including: The Electrical Equipment Manufacturing \nCompany, Thu Doc Mechanical-Electrical Company, Power Engineering Consulting Company (PECC) No. 1, \nPECC2, PECC3, PECC4, Electrical Engineering College, Electrical Engineering School (EES) No. 2, EES3, \nElectrical Training School, Information Technology Centre, and Institute of Energy. \n8  Power Company 1, (PC1), Power Company 2, Power Company 3, Power Company Hanoi; Power Company Ho \nChi Minh; Power Company Haiphong; and Power Company Dong Nai. ", "3 \n11,185 GWh  to  34,841 GWh)  and  reduced  the  system  losses  from  21.7%  to  12.8%. \nUnderpinned by strong economic growth, according to MP5 AF, the demand for electricity is \nexpected to reach 82,986 GWh by 2010 with peak demand reaching 16,033 MW in 2010 from \n7,366 MW in 2003. To meet the demand growth, EVN expects to have an installed capacity of \n20,583 MW by 2010 compared with 8,900 MW in 2003. \n \n9.  Presently,  northern  Viet  Nam  accounts  for  approximately  37%  of  the  country\u2019s \ngeneration capacity and 39% of total electricity consumption. The electricity sales and the peak \ndemand in northern Viet Nam are expected to reach 30,766 GWh and 6,090 MW, respectively, \nby 2010 compared with 13,654 GWh and 3,154 MW in 2003. In order to meet this load growth, \nthe Government and EVN have decided to construct a 500 kV ring main transmission system \naround the major load centers in the north, covering Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh. The \nproposed project is part of this expansion in the north. Similarly, load growth has also increased \nin  the  south,  and  the  Government  and  EVN  are  constructing  a  similar  500 kV  ring  main \ntransmission system around the major load centers of Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, \nand Ba Ria\u2013Vung Tau (parts of this southern transmission system is also being financed by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] and World Bank). The north and south 500 kV \nnetworks are currently connected by a single 500 kV line but a second 500 kV line is under \nconstruction to facilitate transfer of power between the two systems (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Policies \n \n10.  The Government\u2019s power sector policy and reform objectives were first articulated in the \nPower Sector Policy Statement issued by the Ministry of Industry on 1 December 1995. In 1997, \nthe Government updated its Power Sector Policy Statement, outlining its objectives and strategy \nfor the development of the power sector. In October 2004, the Government approved a new \nPower Sector Strategy (2004-2010).9 The policy objectives and reform strategy included in the \n2004 updated statement are to (i) provide electricity access to the national economy and the \nentire population of Viet Nam; (ii) increase the operating/technical efficiency of the electricity \nsector to optimize the use of scarce investment resources; (iii) ensure system reliability and \nquality of electricity supply; (iv) use country's primary energy sources such as hydropower, gas, \noil, and coal for power generation; (v) gradually establish competitive domestic power market \nand encourage investments into the sector from non-EVN entities including private sector; \n(vi) promote regional power trading and cross-country transmission links; and (vii) set electricity \nprices at levels that promote investments in the sector. \n \n11.  To help achieve these policy objectives, the  2004 Power Sector  Strategy outlined a \nreform strategy that included developing a regulatory framework, adopting cost-based tariffs, \npromoting  private  sector  participation  in  the  supply  of  power,  increasing  rural  access  to \nelectricity,  powergrids,  and  undertaking  demand-side  management.  The  Government\u2019s \nstructural  reform  objective  is  to  transform  the  power  sector  enterprises  into  efficient \ncommercially run entities that are financially strong and creditworthy, and have management \nautonomy in their operations. The key strategy includes  (i) corporatizing the EVN-owned power \nplants, (ii) developing efficient pricing and contractual relationships between the transmission \nnetwork  businesses  and  the  generation  stations  on  the  system,  (iii) converting  the  power \ncompanies (i.e., the seven distribution companies) into limited liability companies that have true \nfinancial and management autonomy, (iv) equitizing (i.e., partially divesting) power plants and \n                                                 \n9  Decision No. 176/2004 Q D-77G, Government of Viet Nam. ", "4 \nselected units of power companies, and  (v) converting EVN into a holding company to hold the \nGovernment\u2019s stake in the reformed power sector. \n \n12.  The objective of legal and regulatory reform in the strategy is to form a consistent legal \nframework to facilitate commercial operations and government oversight of the sector. The key \nsteps include (i) promulgating an Electricity Law; (ii) developing supporting secondary legislation \nto the Electricity Law to address (a) the scope and structure of the regulatory agency, (b) \nprocedures for tariff setting and regulation, and (c) administrative regulations and standards; \nand (iii) preparing a grid code for interconnection and operating standards between generation \nentities and the transmission entities. \n \n13.  The electricity pricing objective is to use cost-based principles to set retail prices so as to \nensure financial viability and promote efficient use of electricity, and efficient internal transfer \nprices to motivate the power companies to operate efficiently and purchase power economically. \nAlthough the prevailing average tariff is set at a level below the estimated long-run marginal cost, \nthe tariffs are adequate to meet the financial obligations of the sector and to generate cash flows \nto meet an adequate share of the new investments. However, with increasing financing needs of \nthe sector and expected returns on investments by private investors in the sector, the Government \nis committed to undertaking appropriate measures, including tariff adjustments, to ensure the \nfinancial viability of the sector as captured by prudential financial covenants. It is expected that \nthrough these tariff adjustments, the tariff will eventually approach the long-run marginal cost. \n \n  2.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n14.  ADB has approved a total of $186.3 million10 in loans to the power sector of Viet Nam. \nThe loans were primarily for extensions and rehabilitation of existing medium- and low-voltage \nsubstations and distribution networks in the northern, central, and southern regions of the \ncountry. In addition, ADB provided $6.76 million in technical assistance (TA) for five PPTAs and \nsix  advisory  TAs  (Appendix  2).  The  more  recent  advisory  TAs  provided  support  for  the \nrestructuring of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector and the PPTAs supported further expansion and \nrehabilitation of the subtransmission and distribution networks. ADB has also supported private \nsector investment in power generation through its Private Sector Operations Department.11 \nDirect loans and partial risk guarantees were provided for the Phu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 power \nprojects.  \n \n15.  The other major funding agencies to the power sector are JBIC,12 World Bank, and \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida).  Since  1993,  JBIC  has \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1972.

Manila (Loan No. 1923-VIE, for $40 million (Loan) and \n$35 million Partial Risk Guarantee, approved on 18 October 2003. \n12 In 1999, JBIC was formed by the merging of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan (OECF) and the \nExport-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM). ", "5 \ncommitted cumulative ODA funds of \u00a5265,808 million (approximately $2.44 billion) or 33% of its \nODA budget in Viet Nam, to the power sector. These funds were mainly for gas- and coal-fired \nthermal power plants, hydropower plants, and 500 kV transmission lines.13 JBIC is the biggest \nsingle lender for the development of the power sector in Viet Nam. The World Bank has also \nhad a strong presence since the early 1990s. It has provided loans for generation, transmission, \nand distribution. It has also provided TA in the following areas: power sector policy and strategy, \ninstitutional strengthening, demand-side management, and renewable energy. Some of the \nassistance  included  TAs  for  Phu  My  2.2  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  implementation, \ndevelopment  of  the  Electricity  Law,  and  promotion  of  rural  and  renewable  electrification. \nCumulatively, the World Bank has committed $919 million in loans to the power sector since \n1999. SIDA support for the power sector began in 1980s, and it has committed a cumulative \namount of $150 million in ODA funds (loans and TAs) to the power sector in Viet Nam. Other \nbilateral sources of assistance to the power sector include Canada, France, Germany, and \nUnited Kingdom. \n \n  3.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n \n16.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s energy policy and overarching goal of poverty reduction, \nADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector of Viet Nam, as articulated in the 2004 CSPU (2005-2006), \nis to realize the following objectives: (i) ensure stable power supply for economic activity through \nfinancing  and  implementation  of  needed  power  sector  infrastructure  projects  including \ntransmission, distribution, and generation (hydroelectric and thermal). Investments in power \ngeneration would complement private sector investments and would be structured in a manner \nto fill the investment gap in power generation after taking into account private sector capability \nor interest to meet the overall investment requirement of the power sector; (ii) promote financial \nand fiscal sustainability by unbundling EVN, into generation, transmission, and distribution \ncompanies  that  can  operate  as  commercially  viable  and  financially  independent  entities; \n(iii) create an enabling environment for private sector participation in a competitive power \nmarket in Viet Nam; (iv) encourage expansion of rural electrification subsystems and the use of \nrenewable energy sources for power generation; and (v) encourage the transfer of power in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) by providing assistance to Viet Nam to improve its power \ntransmission infrastructure. The Private Sector Operations Department will continue to support \nthe mobilization of private resources to complement the public sector investments in the sector. \n \n17.  To date, ADB has concentrated on providing support to the Government through loans in \nthe transmission and distribution subsectors and TA to improve the commercialization, financial \nviability  through  tariff  reforms  and  sector  reforms  aimed  at  creating  a  competitive  market \nstructure  and  private  sector  participation.  The  2004  CSPU  (2005-2006)  includes  an  OCR \nlending program to support the power generation under the strategic parameters mentioned in \npara. 16. The TA program also includes support to specific restructuring activities critical for \nachieving the objectives outlined in para. 16 and to support the successful implementation of \nproposed investment loans. \n \n  4.  Policy Dialogue \n \n18.  ADB has been engaging the Government and EVN in dialogue on power sector reform \nthrough its previous loans and TAs since 1995. As a result of this dialogue, Loan 1585-VIE(SF) \n                                                 \n13 Thermal  power  projects  (i)  Phu  My  (\u00a561,932 million),  (ii)  O  Mon  (\u00a543,819 million),  and  (iii)  Pha  Lai \n(\u00a572,826 million); hydropower projects (i) Han Thuan (\u00a553,074 million), (ii) Da Nhim (\u00a57,000 million), and (iii) Dai \nNinh (\u00a543,819 million); and Phu My to Ho Chi Minh City 500kV transmission line (\u00a513,127 million). ", "6 \ncontained four major sector reform covenants. The covenants included (i) promulgation of the \nElectricity Law, (ii) preparing secondary laws or decrees to facilitate implementation of the \nElectricity Law, (iii) establishing an independent regulator, and (iv) ensuring that EVN and the \nfive power companies (at that time) undertake steps to commercialize their operations in line \nwith the recommendations of TA 2345-VIE.14 Loan 1585-VIE(SF) will close on 31 December \n2004 and the Government\u2019s level of compliance has been mixed. This is due to high-profile \nfailures  and  design  flaws  of  restructured  and  competitive  power  markets  worldwide,  the \nGovernment took a cautious approach and spent more time examining the most appropriate \nstructure and way to proceed with the power sector reform. As a result, the Electricity Law was \nnot passed on the date covenanted. There has been more than 20 revisions and in May 2004 \nthe Law was finally submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation. The Electricity Law was \napproved on 10 November 2004. The provision for establishing the independent regulator was \nalso included in the Electricity Law and the decision for establishing the independent regulator \nwill be made by the Prime Minister upon promulgation of the Electricity Law. In addition, the \nGovernment has directed EVN to begin the process of corporatizing and equitizing (i.e., partially \nprivatizing) some of EVN\u2019s operating units as a pilot exercise. Two provincial branches of \nPC 1\u2014Ninh Binh Power Utility and Hai Duong Power Utility\u2014are  in  the  process  of  being \ntransformed into single-member limited liability companies.15 The Khanh Hoa Power Utility (a \nprovincial branch of PC 3) is scheduled to be equitized16 in 2005. In addition, Can Tho thermal \npower station will be transformed into a single-member limited liability company by end 2004. \n \n19.  The recommendations of ADB TA 3763-VIE,17 as agreed with the Power Sector Reform \nCommittee, include (i) unbundling and commercializing EVN, (ii) establishing tariff regulations \nfor a power market, (iii) creating a power market (\u201csingle-buyer\u201d model) by 2009, (iv) creating a \nwholesale power market by 2012, and (v) creating a retail competition market by 2018. The road \nmap for achieving these goals was developed under this TA (Supplementary Appendix E) and \nthe Government has pledged to maintain the reform momentum begun under the TA. ADB, \ntogether with major lenders such as the World Bank and JBIC, are assisting the Government in \nEVN\u2019s transition through bilateral and loan-associated TA. A set of TAs recommendation with \ntime-bound action plan has been prepared for the Government and EVN (Appendix 3) by ADB \nTA 3763-VIE to be implemented with external assistance. The Government has requested ADB \nto coordinate in mobilizing such assistance to provide financial and/or technical assistance. The \npresent loan will augment and enhance previous attempts at effective sector reform through \nappropriately set loan covenants. Also, during the implementation of the present loan, further \ninterventions (i.e., TA grants and loans) aimed at supporting the power sector reforms will be \nprovided. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n \n20.  In the last two loans, namely 1358-VIE(SF) and 1585-VIE(SF), covenants aimed at \nincreasing the retail electricity tariffs to approach long-run marginal costs for the entire system \nwere included. The Government had great difficulty in complying with these covenants as it  \nbelieved that there was no clear justification for increasing retail tariffs if certain financial \nperformance ratios (also covenanted) were met. During the midterm review  for Loan 1585-\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1995.

Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Roadmap for Power Sector Reform. \nManila. ", "7 \nVIE(SF), ADB verified that the self-financing and debt service coverage ratios were met by PC 2 \nand PC 3, the two executing agencies (EAs) under Loan 1585. Although the covenant on the \nrate of return on assets was not met, EVN was still generating sufficient cash to service debt \nand self-finance a reasonable portion of its capital expenditures. ADB and the World Bank have \nsince agreed that financial ratios, based on audited financial statements, which focus on internal \ncash generation, such as debt service coverage and self-financing ratios, that also indirectly \ncaptures profitability, should be used to set the average tariff level. These ratios would also \ncapture the financing requirement of the large capital expenditure program and the increased \nreturns expected by the private investors in the sector. An independent \u201ccreditor\u2019s model\u201d is \nbeing prepared with a World Bank assistance to assess the financial viability of EVN and to \nenable the lenders to assess the adequacy of the tariffs and to prescribe remedial measures \nshould the financial viability of the sector come under stress. As part of the \"creditor's model\" \nwork, World Bank is also assisting EVN with a tariff study that would address distortions and \ncross subsidies in retail tariff structures. The model has been completed and the tariff study \nwould be completed in early 2005. This would then assist EVN in tariff setting to ensure that \nfinancial ratios are met. \n \n21.  The Government\u2019s approval process for project procurement, in particular, remains time \nconsuming and has led to delays in project implementation. To compensate for these factors, \nthe  Project  has  undertaken  advance  procurement  action  and  project  management \nresponsibilities have been shared between two implementing agencies, the Northern Viet Nam \nPower Project Management Board (NPPMB) and NLDC to ensure smooth implementation. As \nthese two agencies are dependent units of EVN, as the EA for the Project EVN will monitor and \nmaintain oversight over project implementation. The Project will follow the sector loan approach \nand the Government has also agreed to take measures to expedite approval process for project \nprocurement. It is envisaged that the above measures will greatly reduce procurement time and \navoid the delays experienced in the previous two projects. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n22.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) directly  expand  and  strengthen  EVN\u2019s \ntransmission system in the north to improve system reliability and quality, and (ii) indirectly \nimprove the efficiency of the power sector by promoting restructuring and commercialization of \nEVN.  The  Project  and  the  subsequent  ADB  interventions  programmed  during  the \nimplementation period of the Project will support the power sector reform efforts by ensuring \nthat EVN\u2019s generation units are corporatized/equitized and in establishing of a single-buyer \npower  market  with  transparent  regulation  of  the  sector  in  2009.  The  establishment  of  a \ntransparent regulatory mechanism would also improve the private sector investment climate. \n \n23.  The Government\u2019s sector policy and financing needs of the sector, and the capacity of \nEVN to implement the sector development program have been assessed and found to be \nacceptable and consistent with ADB\u2019s sector policy and ADB\u2019s requirements and procedures \napplicable to sector loans. Although the Project does not finance any sector restructuring \nassistance directly, provisions have been made in the 2004 CSPU for advisory TA in 2005 to \nimprove the capability of EVN in meeting the restructuring challenge that lies ahead of it. Hence, \nthe Project is structured as a sector loan consisting of two main components and a subset of \nabout 24 subprojects, half of which have been appraised and the other half are to be appraised \nduring the implementation phase. ", "8 \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Infrastructure Component \n \n24.  Due to the need to strengthen the northern transmission network to enable transmission \n(with adequate reliability and quality) of power from additional generating capacity programmed \nover the next 5 years, the Government has requested that the Project focus on subprojects in \nthe north of the country. These subprojects would be undertaken during a 5-year period from \n2005. The Project has two major components\u2014Part A: expansion and upgrading of the 500 kV \nand 220 kV transmission systems to transfer additional power to improve system reliability and \nenhance the efficient utilization of existing and new power plants, and Part B: upgrading and \nexpansion  of  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  through  the \nprovision of remote terminal units (RTUs)  for substations and power plants, software and \nhardware upgrades to national regional load dispatch centers, and communications facilities \nlinking three regional load dispatch centers (north, central, and south), and NLDC in Hanoi with \nthe  RTUs  in  substations  and  power  stations.  This  will  improve  load  dispatch,  system \nperformance, and system reliability. The candidate subprojects are described briefly in Appendix \n4. \n \n  2.  Technical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \n25.  The justification  of  each  subproject  is  supported  by  load-flow  and  stability  studies, \nevaluation of alternatives, detailed design, cost estimates, financial and economic analyses, \nsummary initial examination of environmental and social issues, and implementation schedules. \nTwenty  four  subprojects  (out  of  a  total  number  of  410  candidate  500 kV  and  220 kV \ntransmission subprojects) were selected from EVN's Fifth Master Plan for support under this \nloan. Subprojects were selected on the basis of (i) technical suitability and (ii) environmental \nconsiderations and social soundness conforming to relevant ADB guidelines. The financial and \neconomic internal rates of return (FIRR, EIRR) for individual subprojects were not calculated as \nthey were part of EVN's overall investment over the period 2004\u20132010 for which a detailed \nfinancial and economic analysis has been done. Since all the identified subprojects are based \non well-proven technology and are generally within EVN's implementation capability, there are \nno significant technical or engineering risks. The planning and implementation capability of EVN \nhas been reviewed and found to be satisfactory. \n \n26.  To date, 12 subprojects have been appraised with the remaining 12 will be appraised \nduring implementation. The criteria for selection of the subprojects, and any other subproject not \nidentified at appraisal but still part of the Fifth Master Plan, or subsequent revision thereof, will \nrequire EVN to produce (i) a technical feasibility study for each subproject, (ii) a resettlement \naction plan (RAP), and (iii) an environment assessment plan (EAP). The technical feasibility \nstudy will include a detailed engineering design of the subproject, including alternatives and \nindication  that  this  is  the  least-cost  solution,  cost  estimates,  procurement  packaging,  and \nimplementation schedule. Further, the RAP and EAP of proposed subprojects must meet the \nrequirements of the Resettlement Framework (Supplementary Appendix B) and the criteria for \nenvironmental requirements as given in the initial environmental examination (IEE). For each \nsubproject to be appraised, EVN will need to submit an appraisal report to ADB for approval. \nAppendix 5 provides the format for submission of the subproject appraisal report. Proposed \nsubprojects that do not meet the above requirements will not be approved for inclusion in the \nProject. \n ", "9 \n  3.  Resettlement \n \n27.  The  Project  will  require  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  and  extension  of \nsubstations, and of any necessary access roads as well as  towers and foundations for the \ntransmission lines. For the first batch of  subprojects appraised,it was identified that a total of \n901 households (2,474 people) will be affected by land acquisition. Of these, 357 households \n(825 people) will be severely affected and 544 households (1,649 people) will be marginally \naffected. Two hundred four households will have to move from their houses (but should be able \nto rebuild on their remaining plot of land). The total land to be permanently acquired will be \n243,493 hectares, which will severely affect 113 households (104 losing agricultural land and \nnine losing forestry land). Another 909,561 hectares of land will be acquired for temporary use \nduring the construction phase. Only two small businesses are affected, and even then, only \nmarginally. Except for land required for towers, the land within the right-of-way can continue to \nbe  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  Compensation  for  all  lost  assets  will  be  provided  at \nreplacement cost at current market value, and socioeconomic rehabilitation measures will be \nprovided to ensure that affected people will be at least as well off as they would have been in \nthe absence of the Project. The poorest affected and vulnerable affected people will be assisted \nto improve their socioeconomic status. \n \n28.  A RAP has been prepared for the following project components: (i) construction of \n151.59 km  of  500 kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  from  Quang  Ninh  to  Thuong  Tin, \n(ii) construction of one 500 kV substation at Quang Ninh and one 220 kV substation at Van Tri, \nand (iii) expansion of one 500 kV substation at Thuong Tinh in Ha Tay province and one 220 kV \nsubstation  at  Vat  Cach  in  Haiphong  province.  A  resettlement  policy  framework  has  been \nprepared to guide NPPMB in addressing resettlement issues related to those components and \nsubprojects for which no feasibility study has yet been undertaken but which are expected to \nform part of the Project. The Summary Resettlement Plan and Framework is attached as \nAppendix  6  and  the  full  Resettlement  Action  Plan  and  Resettlement  Framework  are  in \nSupplementary Appendixes A and B, respectively. \n \n  4.  Capacity Building \n \n29.  NPPMB staff assigned to the Project does not have adequate experience in involuntary \nresettlement. NPPMB and its local consultants will be assisted, therefore, to strengthen their \ncapacity  for  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  An  international  and \ndomestic resettlement consultant will be recruited to provide formal and on-the-job training \nduring project implementation and to guide and supervise preparation, implementation, and \nmonitoring of the RAPs. \n \nC.  Special Features \n30.  Since its creation in 1995, EVN's financial performance has been reasonable and it has \nconsistently made a profit. This performance has mainly been attributed to  the operational \nefficiency  gains  EVN  has  achieved  coupled  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Vietnamese \neconomy as a whole, resulting in a large increase in demand for electricity. Electricity demand \nhas increased at a faster rate than GDP, and EVN has taken advantage of this fact. However, in \norder to satisfy future demand resulting from sustained economic growth, EVN will need to \nmake considerable investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. As it continues to \nincrease its indebtedness at a rapid pace, this rate of expansion could have a significant impact \non financial performance. \n ", "10 \n31.  Despite  its  ambitious  capital  expansion  program,  it  appears  EVN  can  maintain  its \nfinancial viability, provided that tariff increases are implemented as  projected and additional \nfinancial income from equitization is realized. Although EVN has already achieved significant \nefficiency  improvements  (i.e.,  system  losses  at  12.8%  and  receivables  of  20  days),  it  is \nexpected that further gains will be realized, especially in unit cost of power generation, due to \nthe introduction of competition in power generation. Financial performance covenants have \nbeen set on this basis to ensure financial viability while at the same time providing EVN with \nenough financial flexibility to make the necessary adjustments in the short term. As shown in \nAppendix  7,  compliance  of  the  financial  covenants  is  projected  over  the  forecast  period. \nHowever, should additional income not materialize from equitization or revenue not grow in line \nwith these assumptions, further increases in retail tariffs may be required to maintain covenant \ncompliance.  \n \n32.  EVN\u2019s competence as an EA has been demonstrated by its successful implementation \nof two World Bank loans and the two ADB loans, which has supported PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3. A \nsector loan is therefore considered appropriate to finance a portion of EVN\u2019s investments over \nthe next 5 years. Through the sector loan approach, ADB can support EVN to improve power \nsystem performance and facilitate further sector reform. A sector loan approach will internalize \nthe process of choosing subprojects that meet technical, financial, economic, environmental, \nand social criteria appropriate to modernizing the power subsector. The sector loan approach \nwill also provide EVN with sufficient flexibility to optimally utilize the cofinancing assistance \nprovided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n33.  The Project consists of two main components\u2014Part A: investments in 500 kV and \n220 kV transmission lines and Part B: upgrading of NLDC and associated facilities. The Project \ncomprises of about 24 subprojects (12 of which are still to be appraised). The cost estimates are \nexpressed in 2004 prices and include provisions for resettlement expenses, taxes and duties \n(i.e., for appraised subprojects),  and interest during construction. The cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 8. Due to the sector loan approach, the \ncontingencies were not separately estimated for the subprojects yet to be appraised and the \ncontingencies of appraised subprojects are included in the cost estimates of these projects for \nboth foreign exchange and local currency expenses. Interest during construction is calculated \nbased on the applicable long-term interest rates for relevant financing sources. \n ", "11 \nTable 1: Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency \nPart A: Transmission       \nAppraised Subprojects  91.9  37.2  129.1 \nAdditional Subprojects to be Appraised  41.7  17.4  59.1 \n       \nPart B: NLDC Upgrade  21.1  3.2  24.3 \n       \nResettlement Cost  0.0  13.3  13.3 \nConsultancy Cost   0.4  4.5  4.9 \nTaxes and Duties  0.0  12.6  12.6 \n       \nBase Cost  155.1  88.2  243.3 \n       \nIDC  19.5  10.8  30.3 \n       \nTotal  174.6  99.0  273.6 \n     IDC = interest during construction, NLDC = national load dispatch center. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n34.  The Government has requested a loan of $120,000,000 from ADB's  ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. ADB will fund 68.5%  of the foreign exchange cost, totaling 43.8% of the \nestimated  project  cost,  and  0.5%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  Also,  the  Government  has \nrequested AFD18 to provide \u20ac40 million (approximately $50 million) cofinancing for the Project. \nThe \u20ac40 million loan from AFD will represent 28.6% of the foreign exchange cost or 18.3% of \nthe overall cost of the Project. It will have a grace period of 5 years and a repayment period of \n15 years. The interest rate will be set at the 6-month European interbank offered rate (Euribor) \nwith the option of converting to a fixed rate. The Government will provide $4.9 million in foreign \nexchange and $98.7 million equivalent as counterpart financing, which accounts for 37.9% of \ntotal  costs.  This  includes  financing  civil  works,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \n35.  The ADB and AFD loans will be lent to the Government and then onlent to EVN at the \nADB\u2019s interest rate applicable to OCR loans and at AFD's interest rate, plus an onlending fee \ncurrently at 0.2% per annum. EVN will assume the foreign exchange risk arising from ADB/AFD \nloans. The local currency expenses not financed by ADB/AFD  loans will be financed from \n                                                 \n18  Negotiations between AFD and the Government is ongoing and it is envisaged that financing from AFD would be in \nplace by end 2004. \n ", "12 \nretained earnings of EVN and local currency borrowings from domestic banks.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  The Project will be implemented as a sector loan and  additional subprojects will be \nintroduced during the implementation stage. The Government has agreed to delegate the \nauthority for approving subprojects to EVN and, once approved, these subprojects would be \nsubmitted to ADB for financing under the Project. Implementation of the Project for the 500 kV \nand  220 kV  substations  and  transmission  lines  will  be  the  responsibility  of  NPPMB,  and \nimplementation of the load dispatch facilities upgrade will be the responsibility of NLDC, in their \ncapacity  of  implementing  agencies.  Adequately  staffed  project  offices  have  already  been \nestablished in Hanoi headquarters of NPPMB and NLDC for supervision of the Project. An \ninternational consultant, in association with suitably qualified domestic consultants, will assist \nNPPMB with resettlement planning, implementation, and internal monitoring. Supervision of \ncontracts will be carried out by staff of the respective implementing agencies.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n37.  Project  implementation  will  start  in  2004  with  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  Bid \ndocuments for international competitive bidding (ICB) packages will be prepared concurrently \nwith technical design to allow bid documents to be approved quickly. Delivery of equipment will \nbe  phased  to  suit  NPPMB\u2019s  and  NLDC\u2019s  storage  capacities  and  capability  of  erection \ncontractors. The Project is expected to be completed by June 2009, 6 months prior to the \nanticipated  loan  closing  of  December  2009.  The  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n38.  Procurement of goods and services for the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nthe  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  equipment  was \nrequested by the Government and approved by ADB in the interest of early implementation of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  authorities  were  informed  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action would not in any way commit ADB to approve the Project subsequently or to \nfinance the costs incurred. Supply of materials and services to be procured from international ", "13 \nsuppliers will be on the basis of ICB or international shopping (IS). Direct purchase procedures \nwill be authorized for some specialized items required for the Project. Civil works and locally \npurchased goods will be procured through   local competitive bidding procedures and EVN\u2019s \ncounterpart funds will be utilized for these local currency expenses. ADB financing will be \nrestricted to goods and services to be procured through ICB, IS, or direct purchase from \nsuppliers. The materials required for the Project will be grouped into packages suitable for ICB. \nSupply contracts estimated to cost less than $500,000, if any, will be procured using IS \nprocedures. Supply contract packages estimated to cost less than $100,000 and standardized \nor critical items for the dispatch facilities, if any, will be procured following ADB direct purchase \nprocedures. As the Project will be cofinanced with AFD, procurement packages relating to \ngoods and services to be procured from international suppliers will be divided between ADB and \nAFD. AFD has agreed to the use of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement for the packages that it \nwill finance (Appendix 10). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n39.  International consultants will be required to assist NLDC in commissioning of SCADA \nand  telecommunications  equipment,  and  upgrading  of  associated  computer  hardware  and \nsoftware at load dispatch centers. It is estimated that about 4 person-months of international \nconsultants will be required for this purpose. In addition, an international resettlement consultant \nwill be required to (i) assist NPPMB to prepare subproject RAPs, (ii) guide and supervise \nresettlement committees, and (iii) train NPPMB and resettlement committees. In addition, an \nindependent local resettlement monitoring consultant will be recruited to (i) conduct a baseline \neconomic  survey  on  a  representative  sample  of  project-affected  people  before  they  are \ndisplaced; and (ii) periodically monitor compliance with the approved RAP by meeting with \nproject-affected people, resettlement committees, NPPMB, and other agencies as appropriate. \nIt is estimated that about 4 person-months of international consultants and 36 person-months of \ndomestic consultants will be required for this purpose. The international consultants will be \nrecruited individually by EVN or NPPMB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants;  other  arrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  used  for  the  selection  and \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  Government  requested  advance  action  for \nrecruitment  of  consultants  to  minimize  front-end  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB \napproved early recruitment action and informed the Government that this action would not in \nany way commit ADB to financing the consultants. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n40.  Disbursements under the Project will be mainly for supply of goods and consulting \nservices. Therefore, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used for \ndisbursement purposes in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Based on the \nprocurement packages outlined in Appendix 10, no imprest account will be required for the ADB \nloan. AFD will be responsible for processing disbursements for the packages financed by AFD. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n41.  EVN will prepare regular progress reports for the Project and submit to ADB on a \nquarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  difficulties \nencountered, and a summary of financial accounts for the Project that will consist of project \nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. The progress reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 1 month of the end of each quarter. EVN will maintain separate \naccounts for the Project. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, EVN will submit ", "14 \n(i) annual project accounts, and (ii) annual financial statements. The annual project accounts will \ncontain detailed descriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures. The annual financial \nstatements will consist of an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and \nrelated notes to the financial statements. The annual financial statements will be consolidated \nfor all of EVN\u2019s operations. The financial management systems and procedures of EVN and \nNPPMB (i.e., the implementing agency for Part A) were assessed and found to be satisfactory \nby the Mission to meet ADB\u2019s requirements. The findings of this review are summarized in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n42.  EVN will continue the current practice of hiring independent auditors to audit its annual \nfinancial statements and annual project accounts, together with the memorandum on issues \nidentified during the audit process. These will be submitted with the respective reports. As part \nof the harmonization of procedures of external funding agencies, the standards to be followed in \nauditing and financial standards have been agreed with the World Bank. For future contracts \nand revisions, the auditors\u2019 terms of reference will be provided to ADB. The accounts will be \nprepared using International Financial Reporting Standards, and the audit will be carried out \nusing International Standards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on \nEVN\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants  and  indicate  the  details  of  the  actual \ncalculation for all ratios, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n43.  NPPMB and NLDC will prepare separate progress reports for their respective investment \ncomponents and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a narrative \nof progress made during the period, changes in the implementation schedule, problems or \ndifficulties encountered, performance of the project implementation consultants, and the work to \nbe carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial \naccount for the investment component, consisting of project expenditures during the period year \nto date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the \nProject based on these reports and meet with EVN, NPPMB, and NLDC and the Government \nsemiannually to discuss project progress. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 3 months of project completion. NPPMB and NLDC will carry out the performance \nmonitoring.  Performance  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  performance  indicators/targets \nstipulated in the project framework (Appendix 11). \n \n8.  Project Review \n44.  A midterm review to be carried out 2 to 3 years after loan effectiveness will focus on the \nengineering, resettlement, and environment aspects of the Project, and review the financial \nstatus of EVN. Representatives of ADB, EVN, and the cofinancier, AFD, will take part in the \nreview. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful \nproject implementation and achievement of objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n45.  The  proposed  sector  loan  comprises  individual  subprojects,  including  a  500 kV \ntransmission line and a series of substations, included in the Government\u2019s power sector \ninvestment  program  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand  in  the  northern  region.  As  these \nindividual subprojects are not stand-alone investments, the economic and financial analyses ", "15 \nwere conducted using a macro time-slice approach for the entire northern region investment \nprogram. The investment program analyzed the period 2004 to 2010 and is based on a least-\ncost expansion plan in generation and transmission. \n46.  The financial and economic viability was examined on the basis of comparing the costs \nand benefits of meeting demand growth by the investment program with a without-investment \nprogram scenario where demand would not be met. The period of the investment program \ndefines all associated costs and benefits of meeting demand growth. The analysis runs out to \n2030 but with investments halting in 2010. The without-investments program scenario assumes \nthat there will be no investments in the north beyond 2004 but accounts for the possibility of \nmeeting demand beyond 2004 from spare capacity.  This case represents the costs of not \nimplementing the investment program and accounts for the subsequent impact on the system. \nThe without-investment scenario assumes that EVN will keep connecting consumers and meet \ndemand until it either runs out of generation capacity or puts stress on the transmission system. \nTo determine the costs associated with the without-investment case, Wien Automatic System \nPlanning (WASP) analysis was carried out for generation, and load-flow studies were conducted \nfor the transmission system, on the assumption that the expansion program in the northern \nregion  would  be  frozen.  The  investment  program  for  the  central  and  southern  regions  is \nassumed to be continued. The consequences include increased operation and maintenance \ncosts, fuel cost increases as generation plants with a higher dispatch cost are forced to operate \nfor longer hours, and the economic costs of unserved energy for consumers. \n \nA.  Financial Analysis \n \n47.  The analysis was made over the period from 2004\u20132030 when power plants built during \n2004\u20132010 would end their useful economic life. The financial evaluation of the investment \nprogram was undertaken in real terms using constant 2004 prices. The cost estimates and \nfinancial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected \neffects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and \nbenefits attributable to the investment program were derived by evaluating the financial position \nof EVN under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe investment program, computed on an after-tax basis, is 12.8%. This compares favorably \nwith the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of EVN for the period under consideration, \nalso computed on an after-tax basis, of 6.9%. When discounted at WACC, the proposed \ninvestment program has a net present value (NPV) of D43.2 trillion. The investment program is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicate that the \nFIRR  for  each  component  and  the  investment  program  overall  are  robust  under  adverse \nconditions. The analysis is explained in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n48.  The  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program  was  analyzed  on  the  basis  of \nincremental costs and benefits as compared to the without-investment scenario. The economic \nbenefits of meeting incremental electricity demands were valued on the basis of willingness to \npay and end-consumer tariffs for each consumer category. A conversion factor of 0.91 was \napplied to the consumer surplus to account for exchange rate distortions. The cost of unserved \nenergy for residential poor and nonpoor consumers was valued in terms of forgone value of \nleisure resulting from the load shedding that would occur in the without-investment scenario. \nThe cost of unserved energy for nonresidential consumers was evaluated at the cost of self-\ngeneration. Benefits associated with increased operation and maintenance and fuel costs, ", "16 \nwhich would result from the without-investment case, are reflected as cost reductions for the \ninvestment scenario.  \n \n49.  Incremental  costs  of  the  investment  program  were  evaluated  in  terms  of  capital \nexpenditures in generation, load dispatch, transmission, and distribution to end-consumers and \nthe cost of energy purchase from independent power producers (IPPs). The conversion factor \nwas  applied  to  nontraded  cost  elements  to  account  for  economic  distortions  in  the  local \neconomy. It is assumed that the connection of new consumers would remain part of government \npolicy and the connections would be the same in the with- and without-project cases, but with \npoorer quality of service.  \n \n50.  The economic analysis is summarized in Table A13.3 of Appendix 13. All costs and \nbenefits were discounted by a social discount factor of 12%. This shows that the investment \nprogram yields an EIRR of 40%. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to key risks \nand assumptions. The result shows that the investment program is economically worthwhile \neven under combined extreme adverse conditions. The risk analysis shows that the risk of \nproject failure is negligible. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n51.  The poverty analysis undertaken for the Project was conducted to identify issues and \nassess impacts at the sector level, since it was difficult to identify specific end-consumers. The \nshare of households connected to the grid is 86% and the majority of the poor are connected. \nConnection rates in the project areas range from 75% to 95%. These high connection rates \nimply that investments made in transmission will have economy-wide and direct benefits to poor \nend-consumers in terms of improving quality both of supply and of electricity services. Improved \nquality of services will reduce the cost of repair and repurchase of appliances and improve the \nquality of lighting. Increased quality of supply implies substantial welfare impacts for poor \nhouseholds. From the overall economy perspective, these welfare impacts may be small (due to \nthe small consumption levels of the poor). However, from the household perspective a reduction \nin electricity expenditure and increased value of leisure are substantial. Reduced electricity \nexpenditure releases household funds for food, health, and education expenditures. Most new \nresidential consumers are expected to be poor. \n \n52.  The majority of benefits to the poor are expected to take place through increasing \ndemand for labor resulting from improved services to industrial and commercial sectors in urban \nand semi-urban areas. Analysis indicates that these sectors will grow substantially in the \nmedium term. Remittances from migrant labor will increase welfare and reduce vulnerability of \nrural households. The poverty analysis is provided in Appendix 14. \n \nD.  Impacts \n \n53.  The Project will cause significant involuntary resettlement, including paddy land for two \nsubstations and forestland for one, and houses and trees that must be removed from the \ntransmission line right-of-way. Impact has been minimized by routing the transmission line away \nfrom built-up areas. Transmission line rights-of-way will be cleared permanently of structures \nand trees, but only the small areas under each tower and pole will be permanently acquired. \nThe rest of the right-of-way will remain the property of the current landowner, who will be able to \nmaintain its current use. Transmission line alignments determined during the feasibility study will \nbe fine-tuned during detailed design and finalized during project implementation. Adequate ", "17 \ncompensation, relocation assistance, and income restoration measures have been designed to \nrestore lost incomes and living standards. \n \n54.  Approximately 7% of the population surveyed during the socioeconomic survey was \nfound  to  be  from  ethnic  minorities.  These  households  were  no  poorer  than  the  average \nhousehold in the project area and more often than not, they were found to be better off. They \nwere, like the majority of the population in this area, working in the agriculture sector and \nappeared to be completely integrated into the life of the rest of their respective communities. Of \nthe affected households, 15 were from ethnic minorities and they all live in Quang Ninh \nprovince. The majority (12) lives in Uong Bi town and is from the Dao and Tay groups. A further \nthree households live in Thong Nhat commune and are from the San Diu group. The Project is \nnot expected to have any effect specific to these groups other than land acquisition, which is to \nbe mitigated by the actions proposed in the RAP. In preparing for further subprojects, attention \nwill be given specifically to assess the impacts on any minority groups likely to be affected. \n \n55.  The Project has been assessed as environmental category B. An IEE for the sample \nsubprojects  is  provided  as  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  A  separate  section  on  candidate \nsubproject  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  including  the  environmental \nselection criteria, is included in the IEE. The sample substations and transmission line will not \nbe located in or traverse any environmentally sensitive areas. Unavoidable impacts entailed \nfrom land take will occur at the two new substation sites but the anticipated impacts are \nconsidered  manageable  with  adequate  mitigation  measures.  The  IEE  provides  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) to reflect best practices, which will ensure that the \nimpacts are adequately monitored and mitigated by the contractors. The EMP will be developed \nduring  the  detailed  design  phase  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  contractors  under  the \nsupervision  of  EVN  during  construction.  Institutional  arrangements  for  conducting  and \nmonitoring the EMP are also provided in detail in the IEE. A series of public consultations on \nproject-related environmental issues have been carried out in each province and will continue \ninto the implementation phase of the Project.  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n56.  Compensation, resettlement, and income restoration measures may not be delivered as \nagreed, thereby impoverishing affected people and delaying commencement of civil works. \nNPPMB will have specialists to assist in implementing the RAPs and NPPMB will engage an \nindependent monitoring organization. \n \n57.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  project  depends  on  the \nimplementation of the other components of the power system\u2019s expansion in northern Viet Nam. \nThese include significant investments in new power generation capacity as well as transmission \ncapacity outside the scope of the proposed Project. This requires concerted efforts by EVN and \nother  public  sector  investors  as  well  as  the  private  sector  in  mobilizing  financing  and \nsuccessfully implementing these projects. It is expected that EVN and the Government will \ncreate  the  enabling  environment  by  removing  entry  barriers  for  third  parties  through  the \nproposed power sector reforms. \n \n58.  The  financial  projections  of  EVN  have  been  prepared  on  the  assumption  that  (i) \noperational  efficiency  gains,  (ii)  proceeds  from  equitization,  and  (iii)  tariff  increases  are \nimplemented  in  a  timely  manner  to  ensure  EVN\u2019s  compliance  with  prudential  financial \ncovenants. If the underlying assumptions relating to fuel cost, cost of purchase power from \nIPPs, and shift in the consumer mix deteriorate from the assumed values, then the required tariff ", "18 \nincreases  would  have  to  be  adjusted.  The  sensitivity  of  financial  ratios  used  as  financial \ncovenants to the adverse movements of these assumptions were assessed and included in \nAppendix 8. This is especially important in the context of the proposed reforms with the \nintroduction of limited competition in power generation under a single-buyer market structure. \nThe setting up of a regulatory body under the proposed Electricity Law with powers to set tariffs \non sound economic and financial grounds in a transparent manner will significantly mitigate this \nrisk (Appendix 1). \n \n59.  It has been assumed that there will be significant private investments both in new \nprojects as well as in acquiring EVN-owned power plants (i.e., equitization). The financial \nproceeds from selling equity stakes also make a significant contribution to EVN\u2019s cash flows. As \nthe power market in Viet Nam is relatively underdeveloped, the private sector must be willing to \ntake the market and regulatory risks that may arise in such a market.  \n \n60.  A key potential concern is the assumption of continued high economic growth of 7%. A \nlower rate of growth would reduce the rate of growth in electricity demand. However, the \nanalysis of risks shows that economic viability of the investment program withstands extreme \nadverse changes in anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Sector restructuring \n \n(a)  Within  6  months  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Electricity  Law,  the \nGovernment  will  promulgate  a  decree  or  regulation  establishing  a \nregulatory authority as envisaged under the Electricity Law. \n(b)  Within  12  months  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Electricity  Law,  the \nGovernment  will  have  established  the  regulatory  authority  envisaged \nunder the Electricity Law. \n(c)  By no later than 30 June 2009, the Government will have ensured that all \nEVN generation units have been corporatized such that each generation \nunit either (i) has become an independent unit, including independent \naccounting, or (ii) has become a single-member limited liability company, \nor (iii) has been equitized such that ownership is held by EVN and one or \nmore other investors. \n \n(ii)  Financial matters \n \n(a)  Commencing 2005, EVN will achieve at all times a self-financing ratio of \nat least 25%, a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times, and a \nlong-term debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. \n(b)  The Government will take all necessary measures to meet the financial \ncovenants in (a), including increasing tariffs as necessary. \n \n(iii)  Social and resettlement matters \n ", "19 \n(a)  NPPMB  will  have  resettlement  specialist  consultants  to  assist  in \nimplementing  the  RAPs  and  will  engage  an  independent  monitoring \norganization. The resettlement consultant and the independent monitoring \norganization  will  be  mobilized  before  commencement  of  any  land \nacquisition activities. \n(b)  (i) EVN or NPPMB will take all measures necessary in implementing the \napproved  updated  RAP  and  RAPs  to  be  prepared  for  subsequent \nsubprojects in accordance with the approved resettlement framework. \nAny update of the RAP will be prepared in full consultation with affected \npeople and disclosed to the affected people prior to submitting to ADB. \nThe approved updated RAP is required before implementation of the RAP \ncan commence. For the updated RAP, NPPMB will undertake a detailed \nmeasurement survey and derive updated compensation unit rates for all \ncategories of losses and allowances. NPPMB will provide to ADB a final \ndatabase  of  affected  people,  a  summary  of  the  updated  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  data,  and  replacement  cost  tables  for  each \nsubproject.  The  updated  RAP  must  include  any  revisions  to  the \nentitlement  matrix;  such  revisions  are  limited  to  inclusion  of  new \nentitlements to address impacts not previously recognized. The updated \nRAP, incorporating the above will be submitted for approval by ADB. The \napproved updated RAP must be implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n  (ii) If  at  any  time  after  the  approval  of  the  updated  RAP significant \nrealignment of any part of any project component is required, NPPMB will \nrevise and update the RAP for that component to take into account the \nrealignment. The updated RAP must be submitted to ADB and approved \nby ADB before any land acquisition activities can begin for the realigned \ncomponent.  Significant  realignment  occurs  when  the  component \nalignment  is  moved  entirely  outside  the  construction  corridor  of  the \nprevious design over a distance of greater than 100 meters. NPPMB will \nensure that the RAP will be revised and updated in accordance with the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n(c)  If the subprojects for which the resettlement framework applies will cause \nresettlement impacts, NPPMB will prepare an RAP for each subproject \nand submit it to ADB for approval. The RAPs will be prepared following \ncompletion of detailed design and approved by ADB prior to the start of \nland  acquisition  activities.  These  RAPs  will  consist  of  detailed \nmeasurement survey findings, compensation unit rates for all categories \nof losses and allowances, budgeting, and a final database of affected \npeople. EVN will ensure that civil works contractors will not be issued with \na notice of possession of site for any section of construction works unless \nNPPMB has (i) satisfactorily completed, in accordance with the approved \nupdated RAP for that subproject, compensation payment and relocation \nto new sites, and (ii) ensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place \nand the area required for civil works is free of all encumbrances. \n(d)  Contractors will not differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork  of  equal  type.  Child  labor  is  not  permitted  in  the  Project\u2019s \nconstruction activities and camps. \n(e)  NPPMB will make satisfactory arrangements for timely acquisition of land, \ntaking the measures necessary to implement all RAPs for the Project to \nthe  satisfaction  of  ADB,  including  (i) full  implementation  of  specific ", "20 \nprovisions for ethnic minorities, if required; and (ii) provision of adequate \ncounterpart funding to cover actual costs. \n \n(iv)  Environment matters \n \n(a)  For each subproject, the Government will ensure that EVN prepares an \nenvironmental assessment  for each candidate subproject, meeting the \nrequirements  of  the  IEE  and  Environmental  Assessment  and Review \nprocedures, for submission for ADB approval prior to subproject approval. \n(b)  The Government will ensure that the Government\u2019s laws and regulations \ngoverning  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments,  as  well  as \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  are  followed.  If  there  is  any \ndiscrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements,  then  these  discrepancies  will  be  identified  during \nsubproject appraisal process and resolved to ADB's satisfaction. \n(c)  The Government and EVN will ensure that the contract documents for all \ncivil  works  under  the  Project  include:  (i)  budget  provisions  for \nimplementation of any  specific measures and monitoring requirements \nthat arise from the environmental assessment and review of subprojects \nand (ii) to give due consideration to prevention of damage to the natural \nenvironment in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of \nproject facilities. \n(d)  The Government will ensure that any environmental management plans, \narising from the environmental assessment and review of subprojects, are \nimplemented under EVN\u2019s supervision in order to adequately monitor and \nmitigate environmental impacts. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n62.  As conditions for loan effectiveness, (i)  a Subsidiary Loan Agreement will have been \nduly  executed  on  behalf  of  EVN  and  will  become  fully  effective,  and  (ii)  the  AFD Loan \nAgreement will have been duly executed and delivered, and all conditions precedent to its \neffectiveness will have been fulfilled. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $120,000,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Northern Power Transmission Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \n                  President \n \n18 November 2004  ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Prior to 1995, the electricity sector in Viet Nam was divided between three vertically \nintegrated  regional  utilities  (i.e.,  power  companies  [PCs]  1,  2,  and  3)  responsible  for  the \nnorthern, southern, and central parts of the country. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) was formed in \n1995, as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) under the purview of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The \npower plants with a capacity of more than 60 megawatts (MW) and transmission facilities above \n110 kilovolts (kV) were brought under EVN. The three power companies were converted to \nindependent accounting units of EVN and have responsibility for operating the network below \n110 kV. The responsibility of distributing electricity in two major cities (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh \nCity) was taken away from PC 1 and PC 2 and entrusted to the newly formed PC Hanoi and PC \nHo Chi Minh City. Since then, two more power companies have been formed to manage the \nelectricity distribution in two other cities (Haiphong and Dong Nai).  \n \n2.  The board of management of EVN is responsible for overall business management \nfunctions and has powers over approving the business plan of EVN, and approving new \ninvestments and procurement below limits stipulated by the Prime Minister. The Ministry of \nIndustry is responsible for overall policy and oversight of the power sector. Under the proposed \nsector reforms, a regulatory agency will be set up within the Ministry of Industry, which is later \nexpected to evolve into a fully independent regulatory body. \n \nA.  Generation \n \n3.  The 15 power plants owned by EVN have a total capacity of 8,909 MW (Table A1.1), \nand are managed as dependent accounting units (i.e., cost centers). The non-EVN participation \nin power generation amounting to 600 MW at present is limited to several diesel power plants \nthat  are  primarily  operated  as  captive  power  plants.  However,  there  are  several  large \nindependent power producers (IPPs) with a combined capacity of over 2,500 MW scheduled to \nbe commissioned in 2004\u20132005. These include Phu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 undertaken by the \nprivate sector with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support and several other IPPs being \ndeveloped by SOEs such as Vina Coal and Petro Viet Nam. The breakdown of the installed \ncapacity of operational power plants and the plants under construction are as follows: \n \n4.  The natural gas-based power plants planned for the south will be implemented either as \njoint ventures between EVN and other parties or as IPPs, except the O Mon I 600 MW power \nplant  presently  under  construction  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC). The large-scale coal power plants in the north would be built by EVN with \nofficial development assistance (ODA) financing or as joint ventures with other SOEs and/or the \nprivate sector. However, these new plants, as well as most of the existing coal power plants, \nwould be equitized (i.e., partially privatized) as part of the proposed sector reforms with EVN \nretaining a majority stake. Although most of the large (i.e., with a capacity of more than \n100 MW) hydropower plants would be implemented by EVN as traditional public sector projects, \na large number of medium-size (10 MW to 100 MW) hydro plants are being developed as IPPs \nby domestic investors. \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \nTable A1.1: Electricity of Vietnam Generation Capacity \n(MW) \n \nItem  Hydro  Coal  Gas Turbine  Oil  Total \nOperational Plants           \n      North  2,050  1,245         3,295 \n      South  1,195              2,482  1,067  4,744 \n      Center     870           870 \n       Total  4,115  1,245        2,482  1,067  8,909 \n           \nPlants Under Construction           \n      North  439  1,700        2,139 \n      South  655         3,370    4,025 \n      Center  1,195        1,195 \n       Total   2,289  1,700       3,370    7,359 \n           \nExpected Capacity by 2010a           \n      North  2,657  3,745                   6,402 \n      South  2,667        7,362  1,067   11,096 \n      Center  3,150         3,150 \n       Total  8,474  3,745       7,362  1,067  20,648 \n MW = megawatt.   \n a Including proposed plants not yet under construction. \n Source: Electricity of Vietnam. \n \nB.  Transmission \n \n5.  The transmission network of EVN consists of a 500 kV single-circuit backbone line from \nnorth to south and 220 kV and 110 kV networks connecting the load centers and most of the \npower  plants.  The  transmission  function  is  divided  among  four  transmission  companies \nadministered as dependent accounting units (cost centers). The national load dispatch center \ncarries out the system operation and dispatching of power plants through three regional load \ndispatch centers. \n \n6.  Under the proposed sector reforms, the four transmission units would be merged to form \na  single  transmission  company  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  EVN.  The  national  load \ndispatch center, which will be upgraded under the present ADB project and the World Bank \nproject proposed for 2005, to meet the requirements of operating the power system once the \nfirst stage of reforms aimed at creating a \u201csingle-buyer\u201d market structure is implemented.   \n \n7.  The 500 kV north-south link is being converted to a double circuit and two 500 kV rings \nwould be built in the north and south to connect the proposed large power plants to the load \ncenters. The ongoing transmission augmentation is mainly aimed at completing the 500 kV ring \naround Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, installing new 220 kV substations, upgrading existing \n220 kV substations to meet the increasing demand, and 220 kV transmission lines to connect \nthe new 220 kV substations.

Distribution \n \n9.  The distribution function is handled by seven units of EVN (i.e., power companies) \noperated  as  profit  centers.  The  power  companies  purchase  bulk  power  from  EVN  at \nadministratively fixed bulk power tariffs at 110 kV level or at medium voltage (i.e., 35 kV and \n22 kV). The bulk price tariffs are set by EVN to enable each power company to achieve a \nreasonable  profit  irrespective  of  its  cost  structure.  This  results  in  more  efficient  power \ncompanies having to pay a higher tariff for bulk power purchases and cross subsidize less \nefficient companies.  \n \n10.  There are three power companies (i.e., PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3) serving northern, \nsouthern, and central Viet Nam, respectively, and  there are four separate power companies \nserving the four major cities. (i.e., PC Hanoi, PC Ho Chi Minh City, PC Haiphong, and PC Dong \nHa). The power companies directly supply industrial, commercial, and other consumers and \nresidential consumers in urban areas. In rural areas, consumers supplied at low voltage are \nsupplied through retailers (e.g., rural cooperatives, agents, community organizations) as the \npower company\u2019s network is only up to the low-voltage transformer. This has resulted in poor \nsupply quality and high losses in the low-voltage network maintained by third parties.  \n ", "24  Appendix 1 \n11.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  power  companies  will  be  converted  into  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries of EVN and that the provincial units of power companies will be partially privatized \nas part of the sector reforms.

Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n1.  The  Project  will  require  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  of  and  extension  of \nsubstations and any necessary access roads and towers and foundations for the transmission \nlines. Land acquisition requirements have been minimized by designing the route of the new \ntransmission line (T/L) to avoid passing through markets, densely populated areas, villages, \npagodas, protected areas, and historical or cultural assets, and the dimensions of towers have \nbeen adapted to the terrain. Tables A6.1 and A6.2 present the breakdown of land acquisition \nestimated for each subproject that has been appraised. The first batch of subprojects appraised \nhas identified that a total of 901 households (2,474 people) will be affected by land acquisition. \nOf these, 357 households (825 people) will be severely affected and 544 households (1,649 \npeople) will be marginally affected. Two hundred four households will have to move from their \nhouses (but will be able to rebuild on their remaining plot of land). Two small businesses are \nonly marginally affected. \n \nTable A6.1: Summary Impacts on Land \n \nAgricultural Land    Forestlanda    Residential Land     \n(square meters)  (square meters)  (square meters)  Total Area \nTA  PA    TA  PA    TA  PA    (square meters) \n                   \n \n394,647  108,869    493,707  173,874    21,207   \u2014    1,192,304 \n     PA = permanently affected area, TA = temporarily affected area. \n       a    Planted forest, not old growth. \n    Source: TA 4051-VIE Resettlement Action Plan.  \n \nTable A6.2: Summary of Project-Affected Households and People by Component \n(Number) \n \nConstruction of  Construction  Expansion of  Expansion of \nProject Affected  Transmission  Quang Ninh  of Van Tri  Vat Cach  Thoung Tin \nHouseholds/People  Line  Substation  Substation  Substation  Substation \n           \nSeverely affected \nhouseholds  284  5  62  3  3 \nSeverely affected \npeople  825  21  264  14  14 \nMarginally affected \nhouseholds  468  31  33  9  3 \nMarginally affected \npeople  1,649  159  135  30  10 \nSource: Resettlement Action Plan. \n \nB.  Scope of Resettlement Action Plan and Resettlement Framework \n \n2.  The resettlement action plan (RAP) has been prepared for the following first batch \nproject components: (i) the construction of 151.59 kilometers of a 500-kilovolt (kV) double-circuit \ntransmission line from Quang Ninh to Thuong Tin; (ii) the construction of one 500 kV substation \nat  Quang  Ninh  and  one  220 kV  substation  at  Van  Tri;  and  (iii) expansion  of  one  500 kV \nsubstation at Thuong Tinh in Ha Tay province and one 220 kV substation at Vat Cach in \nHaiphong province. To guide preparation of RAPs for those subprojects for which feasibility \nstudies have not yet been carried out, a resettlement framework (RF) has also been prepared.  ", "32  Appendix 6 \nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n4.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  of  the  Project  have  been  based  upon \nVietnamese legislation, the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). The Government\u2019s policy \nand legal framework toward resettlement are moving much closer  toward the principles of \nADB\u2019s policy. However, provisions and principles adopted in the RAP and RF for the Project \nsupersede the provisions of the relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever there \nis a discrepancy. \n \nD.  Project Principles \n \n5.  The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n \n(i)  The principal objective of the RAP and RF is to ensure that the people affected \nby the Project should be at least as well off as, if not better off than, they would \nhave been without the Project. Project-affected people should at least be able to \nmaintain and preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life. \n(ii)  The populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may stand to \nlose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and nonphysical \nassets, including homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, \ntenancy,  income-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and \nrelationships, as well as other losses that may be identified during the process of \nresettlement planning. \n(iii)  Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized by identifying possible \nalternative project designs and appropriate social, economic, operational, and \nengineering solutions that have the least impact on the population in the project \narea. \n(iv)  Neither  lack  of  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost,  tenure  status,  nor  social  or \neconomic  status  will  bar  the  affected  person  from  entitlement  to  the \ncompensation and rehabilitation objectives and measures outlined in the RAP. \n(v)  The cut-off date for eligibility for compensation for physical assets affected by \nproject  activities  such  as  the  construction  of  the  transmission  line,  towers, \nconstruction of the substations and construction of roads will be the date of \ncompletion of the detailed measurement survey and census after the detailed \ndesign has been completed for these components. \n(vi)  All project-affected people will be entitled to be compensated at replacement cost \nat current market value for affected assets, incomes and businesses; all severely \naffected project-affected people will also be provided with transitional assistance \nand income restoration and other rehabilitation assistance which will be sufficient \nto improve or at least restore their preproject living standards, income levels, and \nproductive capacity. \n(vii)  After the detailed design has been completed for each component, a census and \nsocioeconomic survey will be conducted as the basis for resettlement planning \nand RAP preparation and a detailed measurement survey will be carried out as a \nbasis for compensation. \n(viii)  In the event of any population relocation, efforts will be made for existing social \nand cultural institutions of the people who are being resettled to be maintained to \nthe greatest extent possible. \n(ix)  Preparation of RAPs, as part of subproject preparation and implementation, is to \nbe  carried  out  with  the  full  participation  of  affected  people,  as  well  as ", "Appendix 6  33 \nrepresentatives  of  the  local  governments  of  the  project-affected  areas, \ncommunity leaders, civil society and social organizations such as the Women\u2019s \nUnion,  the  Fatherland  Front,  farmers\u2019  associations,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. Comments, concerns, and suggestions of those consulted will be \nduly taken into consideration during the design and implementation phase of the \nresettlement plans. \n(x)  The order to commence civil works will not be given for any civil works contract \nfor any subproject to be financed under the Project until the Government has \ncompleted  satisfactorily  and  in  accordance  with  the  approved  RAP, \n(a) compensation payment and relocation to new sites, where applicable, and \n(b) agreed rehabilitation assistance, prior to obtaining possession and rights to \nthe land. \n(xi)  Consideration will be given and assistance provided, where necessary, to those \nmost vulnerable to the adverse impacts of resettlement (including the poorest, \nfemale-headed households, the disabled and elderly with no means of support, \nand those from minority groups) to mitigate their hardships and to assist them in \nimproving their livelihoods. Their needs will be considered in the formulation of \nthe RAP and in the options and mitigation measures identified. \n(xii)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and be made available to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within the \nagreed implementation period. \n(xiii)  Detailed RAPs for implementation will be translated into Vietnamese and placed \nin project and commune offices for the reference of affected people as well as \nany interested groups. \n(xiv)  Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and  the  final  outcome  will  be \nconducted independently of the Executing Agency. \n \nE.  Entitlements  \n \n6.  The  project  entitlements  were  designed  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation for lost assets and restoration or enhancement of the livelihoods of all categories \n(directly  and  indirectly  affected,  titleholders  and  nontitleholders)  of  affected  people.  The \nentitlement matrix for the Project summarizes the main types of losses and the support entitled \nfor each type of loss. Structures will be compensated at full replacement cost at current market \nvalue in materials or cash or a combination of the two, with no deduction for depreciation or \nsalvageable materials. All structures can be rebuilt on remaining land and no resettlement sites \nwill be required. Tenants will be entitled to 6 months rental allowance and assistance to find new \naffordable rental accommodation. Severely affected productive land will be compensated with \nreplacement  (land  if  available,  or  cash  equivalent  to  current  market  value)  and  income \nrestoration  assistance.  Crops  and  trees  will  be  compensated  at  current  market  value. \nTemporarily acquired productive land will be rented at a rate of 10% of the current market value \nand returned to the original user fully restored to its original or better condition. All other \ntemporarily acquired land will not be compensated but will be restored to its original or better \ncondition. There will be no permanent loss of business or salary income. Temporary losses of \nsalary  and  business  income  will  be  fully  compensated.  All  severely  affected  households \n(affected by house displacement and/or loss of more than 10% of productive income-generating \nland) will be entitled to a transition subsistence allowance equivalent in value to 30 kilograms of \nrice  per  person  per  month.  Severely  affected  farmers  will  also  be  entitled  to  agricultural \nextension assistance. Severely affected households and vulnerable households will be entitled ", "34  Appendix 6 \nto skills training for 3\u20136 months and a subsistence allowance during the training period, as well \nas credit assistance to be financed by the Project but administered through existing credit \nprograms. The details of this will be designed during RAP implementation and have been \nbudgeted. No landless or illegal occupants of land were identified during project preparation. In \nthe event that any landless households are identified during the detailed measurement survey, \nthey will be provided with temporary or lease rights to replacement land. Landless project-\naffected people will not be displaced until the commune allocates land for them. Any illegal land \nusers will be compensated for their lost assets. All project-affected people will be assisted to \nrestore or improve their preproject socioeconomic conditions. \n \nF.  Ethnic Minorities and Disadvantaged Groups \n \n7.  The social analysis carried out by the PPTA consultants in 2004 shows that 7.4% of the \npopulation in the project area are from ethnic minorities. They are, like the majority of the \npopulation in the project area, working in agriculture and appear to be integrated into the larger \npopulation and, in general, are better off than average. Of the affected households, 15 were of \nethnic minorities and they all live in Quang Ninh province. The majority of these (12) live in \nUong Bi town and are from the Dao and Tay groups. A further three households live in Thong \nNhat commune and are from the San Diu group. The Project is not expected to have any effect \nspecific to these groups other than land acquisition, which is to be mitigated by the actions \nproposed in the RAP and RF. In preparing for further subprojects, attention will be given \nspecifically to assessing their impacts on any minority groups likely to be affected. Special \nattention will be given to identifying and addressing any special needs of this group as well as \nthose of other vulnerable and/or disadvantaged groups such as the landless, the poor, women-\nheaded households, the disabled, and war veterans. Any that might be identified during the \ndetailed measurement survey will be assisted through the Project\u2019s socioeconomic support \nprogram (skills training, agricultural extension assistance, access to credit, and priority access \nto project-related employment). \n \nG.  Resettlement Strategy and Income Restoration \n \n8.  Households that have to relocate will participate in identifying and selecting options for \ngovernment assistance to relocate on their existing plot, or to move to either group or individual \nrelocation sites, or to receive cash compensation and to make their own arrangements for \nrelocation.  Households  that  are  severely  affected  through  the  loss  of  more  than  10%  of \nproductive assets will be assisted to purchase replacement land or increase productivity on \nremaining  land  or  learn  new  income-generating  skills  through  the  socioeconomic  support \nprogram. In the case that any businesses have to relocate, they will be assisted to do so to \nviable new sites. \n \nH.  Participation of Affected People and Resettlement Disclosure \n \n9.  There was an extensive consultative process during the social analysis and resettlement \nplanning  period  of  the  feasibility  study.  Resettlement  planning  and  RAP  preparation and \nimplementation during project implementation will follow the Project\u2019s participatory approach. A \nsocioeconomic survey was conducted with 30% of seriously affected project-affected people \nand 10% of marginally affected project-affected people in all affected districts/communes. The \nquestions were designed to elicit gender-specific data. Further information dissemination and \nconsultations are to be carried out during the implementation phase of the Project. Grievances \nof project-affected people are to be addressed by the grievance mechanism and process as \ndescribed in Chapter VIII of the RAP. Information on compensation and resettlement options ", "Appendix 6  35 \nhas been disclosed to core subproject-affected people by means of a project information \nbooklet, which has been translated into Vietnamese and delivered to all commune offices. This \nwill be done similarly for all remaining subprojects prior to approval. Copies of all final RAPs will \nalso be displayed in commune offices. The RAP and RF have also been posted on ADB\u2019s web \nsite.  \n \nI.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n10.  The implementation of resettlement activities requires the involvement of agencies at the \nnational, provincial, district, and commune levels. Resettlement committees will be established \nat the provincial, district, and commune levels, as required by Decree CP 22/1998 and will be \nunder the responsibility of Northern Power Project Management Board (NPPMB). Electricity of \nVietnam (EVN) and more particularly NPPMB and its local agencies have limited experience in \npreparing and implementing resettlement activities with ADB. Because of the complexity of this \nsector loan and the number of subprojects, resettlement specialist consultants will be engaged \nfor  the  purposes  of  both  supervision  and  capacity  building  so  as  to  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nJ.  Monitoring of Resettlement Planning and Implementation and Impacts \n \n11.  In  addition  to  internal  monitoring  by  NPPMB,  an  agency,  to  be  known  as  the \nindependent monitoring agency, specialized in social sciences, will be identified, recruited, and \nthen  mobilized  before  the  start  of  any  resettlement  activities,  including  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey. The independent monitoring agency will be required to submit periodic \nreports  on  the  progress  of  implementation  and  make  any  necessary  recommendations \nregarding the issues identified through their monitoring. \n \nK.  Cost Estimates \n \n12.  Total costs for resettlement are estimated at D96,278.07 million ($6,146,853). This is \ncomposed  of  (i) compensation  costs,  which  total  D77,391.41 million  ($4,940,406);  and \n(ii) demolition,  management,  and  implementation  costs,  which  total  D18,886.66 million \n($1,206,547). These sums may, however, change at the time that the detailed measurement \nsurvey takes place to take into account actual losses and any changes in prices that may have \noccurred between the preparation of the RAP and actual implementation. \n \nL.  Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  All resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. NPPMB will \nnot approve commencement of any civil work for any subproject to be financed from the loan \nproceeds, unless the Government has completed satisfactorily and in accordance with the \napproved RAP for that subproject compensation payment and relocation to new sites, and \nensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the \nland. ", "36  Appendix 7 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF ELECTRICITY OF VIETNAM \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Since the creation of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) in 1995, its financial performance has \nbeen reasonable and it has consistently made a profit. This performance has mainly been \nattributable to the rapid expansion of the Vietnamese economy as a whole, resulting in a large \nincrease in demand for electricity. Electricity demand has increased at a faster rate than gross \ndomestic product (GDP), and EVN has taken advantage of this fact. However, in order to satisfy \nfuture demand resulting from sustained economic growth, EVN will need to make considerable \ninvestments  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  As  it  continues  to  increase  its \nindebtedness at a rapid pace, this rate of expansion could have a significant impact on financial \nperformance. \n \nB.  Historical Performance  \n \n2.  As  reflected  by  the  energy  sales  (shown  in  Table  A7.1),  EVN's  operations  have \nincreased by over 75% between 1999 and 2003, representing an annual growth rate of 12%. \nThe total electricity sales have increased from 19.5 TWh in 1999 to 34.4 TWh in 2003. Although \nthe average tariffs net of sales taxes have only increased marginally from D662/kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) (USc4.75/kWh) in 1999 to D789/kWh (USc5.02/kWh) excluding value-added tax (VAT) by \n2003, the net profit margin has improved due to the improvements in operational efficiencies. \nThis  has  enabled  the  net  profits  to  reach  D1,828 billion  (i.e.,  $116 million) by 2003 from \nD1,088 billion ($78 million) in 1999. The financial performance of EVN during the period 1998\u2013\n2003 and the key financial ratios are summarized in Table A7.1.  \n \nTable A7.1: Financial Performance of Electricity of Vietnam, 1999\u20132003 \n(D billion) \n \nItem  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003 \nTotal Revenue  14,124  16,513  19,209  23,566  30,246 \nRevenue from Electricity Sales  12,934  15,135  17,540  21,474  27,481 \nProfit before Interest and Tax  2,618  2,100  2,127  3,110  2,880 \nNet Profit  1,088  883  999  1,650  1,828 \n           \nCash Flow from Operations  5,882  7,311  6,739  8,412  10,904 \nNew Borrowings  6,201  8,866  6,132  6,507  46,337 \nNet Capital Injections  (287)  371  519  175  31 \nInvestments  11,666  13,697  9,206  9,928  13,347 \nDebt Service  1,254  2,036  3,811  2,822  2,703 \n           \nSelf-Financing Ratio (%)  22.7  32.9  49.4  46.4  70.3 \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio  4.8  3.0  1.8  3.5  5.7 \nDebt-Equity Ratio  41:59  48:52  48:52  52:48  53:47 \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)  8.9  6.7  5.1  5.9  11.3 \nCurrent Ratio  2.76  1.70  1.48  1.88  2.00 \nReceivables (days)  32  21  16  22  20 \n Source: Audited accounts of EVN (1999-2003). \n \n3.  The liquidity of EVN had also improved during the period under consideration (1999\u2013\n2003) as reflected by a reduction in the receivables from 32 days of turnover in 1999 to 20 days ", "Appendix 7  37 \nof turnover in 2003. At the same time, it maintains an average payable turnover rate of 200 days \n(partially due to treatment of some capital expenditures as current). This discrepancy between \nreceivables and payables resulted in EVN accumulating a significant cash surplus. This is \nreflected in a current ratio and quick ratio of 1.5 and 1.25, respectively, during the period under \nconsideration.  \n \nC.  Historical Covenant Compliance \n \n4.  In  the  two  most  recent  ADB  loans  to  EVN  (loans  1358-VIE  and  1585-VIE),  EVN \ncommitted to three of its power distribution companies (PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3) maintaining \ncertain financial ratios to ensure the sustainability of ADB's investments. These included a \nminimum self-financing ratio (SFR) of 30%, a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5, and a \nrate of return on net fixed assets (ROR) of 12%. In addition, EVN committed to ADB (i) to \nincrease its average retail tariffs in a phased manner, reaching the equivalent of 7.0 cents/kWh \n(i.e., including 10% VAT) by 1999; (ii) to maintain the ratio of the average residential tariff to the \naverage retail tariff; and (iii) to maintain the level of bulk tariffs charged from EVN to the power \ncompanies as a percentage of retail tariffs. \n \n5.  With regard to the power company covenants, they generally complied with the SFR and \nDSCR but regularly fell short on the ROR covenant. As the power companies were generally \nprofitable, although below the 12% threshold, this covenant was not strictly enforced. However, \nbecause the financial performance of the power companies was largely determined by EVN \nadministratively setting the bulk tariff on an ex-post basis (i.e., at the end of the fiscal year prior \nto finalization of financial statements) to ensure compliance with the ratios, it is proposed that \nfinancial ratios with the power companies should no longer be used as loan covenants. \n \n6.  EVN generally complied with the covenants on the average level of residential tariffs and \nlevel  of  bulk  tariffs  compared  to  average  retail  tariffs.  However,  EVN  was  unable  to  get \ngovernment  approval  to  raise  its  average  retail  tariffs  to  the  7.0  cents/kWh  level  due  to \nperceived negative impacts to economic growth. In 2001, a tripartite meeting was held between \nthe World Bank, ADB, and the Government and a new schedule of tariff increases was agreed \nto raise retail tariffs to 7.0 cents/kWh by July 2005. The first step of the tariff increases was \nimplemented in October 2002 to improve the average tariff to 840 D/kWh (i.e., 5.6 cents/kWh) \nincluding VAT, but the schedule was not maintained thereafter. Although EVN submitted a \nproposal to increase the average tariffs to 5.9 cents/kWh in April 2003 and to 6.2 cents/kWh by \nOctober 2004, the Government has ruled out further tariff increases for the time being in the \ncontext  of  improved  financial  performance  of  EVN  and  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial \ncommitments, including servicing its debt and a substantial portion of the capital investments up \nto 2005 with the present tariffs.  \n \n7.  For these reasons, the World Bank, ADB, and the Government have agreed to move \nforward with new financial covenants based on: (i) consolidated EVN results (not with the power \ncompanies), and (ii) EVN's overall financial viability and performance rather than arbitrary tariff \nlevels set in foreign currency. Proposed covenants are covered in the section on financial \nprojections below. \n \n8.  The cumulative financial performance of EVN during the period 1998\u20132003 and the key \nfinancial ratios are summarized in Table A7.1 above. The detailed financial data on an annual \nbasis are provided in Table SAG.1 of Supplementary Appendix G. ", "38  Appendix 7 \n9.  The cumulative capital investments and the debt service of EVN during 1998\u20132003 \namount  to  D58.7  trillion  ($4 billion)  and  D12.6  trillion  ($850 million)  respectively.  These \ninvestments had been financed through cash flows from operations amounting to D39.2 trillion \n($2.6 billion), borrowings of D46.6 trillion ($3.2 billion), and capital injections of D1.9 trillion \n($140 million). Although these increased borrowings increased EVN\u2019s debt-equity ratio from \n41:59 in 1999 to 53:47 in 2003, EVN still retains the capacity to absorb further borrowings to \nfinance its investments in the context of strong growth in future cash flows and low initial \ngearing. \n \nD.  Financial Projections (2004\u20132010)  \n \n  1.  Sales Growth \n \n10.  Although the corporate structure of EVN is envisaged to be changed under the proposed \npower sector reforms, EVN is likely to remain as a holding company owning significant stakes of \nthe operating subsidiaries. It is assumed that the electricity sales will reach 80.5 terawatt-hours \n(TWh) in 2010 compared with 34.5 TWh in 2003, with annual growth rates slowing to 12.5% \nfrom 2005, down from 15% in 2003 and 2004. It is also expected that EVN will purchase \n32.6 TWh from third parties (i.e., private power producers and joint-venture companies) out of \nthe  total  generation  of  93 TWh  in  2010  at  an  average  cost  of  D730/kWh  (USc4.2/kWh) \ncompared with just  2.1 TWh, the rate at which EVN bought from independent power producers \nin 2003. \n \n11.  The aggregate financial projections of EVN for the time period and the key financial \nratios for the period 2004\u20132009 are shown in Table A7.2. The detailed financial projections of \nEVN on annual basis are provided in Supplementary Appendix G. The Supplementary Appendix \nalso contains the sensitivity of key financial ratios such as DSCR and SFR for several adverse \nmovements in key assumptions has been computed to assess the robustness of the financial \nviability of EVN. \n \nTable A7.2: Financial Performance of Electricity of Vietnam, 2004\u20132009 \n(D billion) \n \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nTotal Revenue  34,496  39,940  50,030  56,613  63,610  71,526 \nRevenue from Electricity Sales  31,421  36,386  45,622  53,696  61,125  69,623 \nProfit before Tax  3,674  1,730  4,481  6,176  7,974  9,405 \nNet Profit  2,456  1,040  2,970  4,151  5,513  6,495 \n             \nCash Flow from Operations  13,580  14,178  17,896  21,270  25,926  30,825 \nEquitization Proceeds    655  1,172  2,321  720  1,863 \nNew Borrowings   14,519  20,551  25,272  31,238  31,093  33,912 \nNet Capital Injections  555  611  992  1,387  1,452  891 \nInvestments in Fixed Assets  22,192  31,220  38,610  47,513  46,721  47,312 \nEquity Investments in JVs  799  1,345  1,772  2,030  1,623   \nDebt Service  4,467  6,419  8,678  11,581  15,141  18,767 \n             \nSelf-Financing Ratio (%)  38.10  27.50  26.20  25.90  32.60  36.10 \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio  3.06  2.32  2.21  2.05  1.97  1.98 \nDebt-Equity Ratio  58:42  63:37  66:34  69:31  69:31  70:30 \nD= Dong, JV = joint venture.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "Appendix 7  39 \n \n  2.  Tariffs \n \n12.  The financial projections assume that average tariff of EVN will increase by 1.3% per \nannum due to the change in consumer mix (i.e., increase in the share of consumption by \ncommercial  and  industrial  consumers  at  the  expense  of  residential  consumers).  This \nassumption is based on the demand forecast for different consumer categories and higher \nindustrial and commercial tariffs relative to residential tariffs. It is further assumed that an \naverage tariff increase of 10.5% (i.e., in addition to the increase in average tariff due to shift in \nthe consumer mix) in 2006 and 3% tariff increase in 2007 in order to meet minimum debt \nservice coverage and self-financing ratios would be required. This would result in the average \ntariff level reaching D973/kWh (USc 5.74/kWh) by 2009 compared to average tariff level of \nD789/kWh (USc 5.02/kWh) in 2003. \n \n13.  To meet the increasing demand for energy, EVN will have to undertake substantial \ninvestments in generation and network capacity. While EVN is expected to undertake most of \nthe transmission and distribution investments, non-EVN entities, i.e., the private sector and \nother  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  will  also  invest  in  power  generation  facilities  to \nsupplement EVN\u2019s investments. The total investments to be mobilized by non-EVN entities in \nthe power sector is expected to be in the order of $3 billion during 2004\u20132009. \n  \n  3.  Capital Expenditures \n \n14.  The cumulative capital investments to be made by EVN during 2004\u20132009 amount to \nD234 trillion ($14.9 billion) compared with D58 trillion ($4.0 billion) during 1998\u20132003, implying a \nthreefold increase in capital investments. In addition to the direct investments, EVN is also \nplanning to form joint-venture companies to implement some of the power generation projects in \n2004\u20132009, and to invest D7.6 trillion ($465.0 million) of equity in these companies. These joint \nventures would also mobilize debt financing of approximately D31,000 billion ($2.0 billion). \n  \n15.  The Government has approved a plan for EVN to equitize (i.e., partially divesture) \nminority stakes in some power generation plants, and the proceeds from these sales are \nincluded in the cash-flow projections and used in the computation of the SFR and DSCR. The \nliabilities of new power plants to be developed as joint ventures between EVN and other parties \nare not consolidated in the base case financial projections as the ownership of structures of \nthese joint ventures has yet to be finalized.  \n \n16.  Although EVN\u2019s internal cash generation is projected to reach D124 trillion ($ 7.9 billion) \nduring 2004\u20132009, the bulk of the investments will be financed by borrowings amounting to \nD153 trillion ($9.8 billion). This indicates significantly increased levels of borrowings compared \nwith 1999\u20132003 when EVN borrowed only D39 trillion ($2.5 billion). In the absence of significant \nequity injections, this investment plan would substantially increase EVN\u2019s debt and its debt \nservice requirements. The debt-to-equity ratio would increase to 70:30 in 2009 from 53:47 at \n2003  and  the  debt  service  requirements  in  2009  would  be  D18.8  trillion  ($1,195 million) \ncompared with D2.29 trillion ($146 million) in 2003, resulting in DSCR dropping to 2.0 by 2009 \nfrom 5.7 in 2003. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition from a lightly geared utility due to lack of \naccess to debt financing prior to 1995, to a more typical utility in a fast-growing economy.    \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \n  4.  Proposed Covenants \n \n17.  Given the increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 \nand minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure that EVN\u2019s debt level \nand its debt service capacity remain within prudential limits. Although the debt-to-equity position \nis steadily increasing and DSCR is decreasing, they are expected to remain within these limits \nduring the forecast period. It is also important to include a minimum SFR of 25% to ensure that \nEVN  is  generating  adequate  cash  flows  to  finance  a  reasonable  portion  of  the  capital \ninvestments to retain the company's leverage within prudential limits. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n19.  Despite its ambitious capital expansion program, it appears that EVN can maintain its \nfinancial viability if tariff increases are implemented as proposed and if additional financial \nincome from equitization is realized. As shown in Table A7.3, compliance of the financial \ncovenants  is  projected  over  the  forecast  period.  However,  if  additional  income  does  not \nmaterialize from equitization or if revenue does not grow in line with these assumptions, further \nincreases in retail tariffs will be required to maintain covenant compliance. \n ", "  Appendix 8  41 \n                                   COST ESTIMATES OF THE CANDIDATE SUBPROJECTS \n($ million) \n \n \n  Foreign  Local    % of Total \nItem  Cost  Cost  Total  Project Cost \nPart A: Transmission         \nA1: 500 kV overhead line         \n        Thuong Tin\u2013Quong Ninh   33.85  29.42  63.27  23.1 \nA2: 500 kV Quang Ninh Substation  20.42  2.80  23.22  8.5 \nA3: 500 kV Thuong Tin Substation  4.20  0.44  4.64  1.7 \nA4: 220 kV Van Tri Substation  11.25  1.95  13.20  4.8 \nA5: 220 kV Nghi Son Substation  2.60  0.27  2.87  1.1 \nA6: 220 kV Trang Bach Substation  2.21  0.31  2.52  0.9 \nA7: 220 kV Dong Ha Substation  2.42  0.34  2.76  1.0 \nA8: 220 kV Vat Cach Substation  4.97  0.69  5.66  2.1 \nA9: 220 kV Nam Dinh Substation  1.79  0.15  1.94  0.7 \nA10: 220 kV Thai Binh Substation  2.70  0.28  2.98  1.1 \nA11: 500 kV Spare Equipment  5.48  0.52  6.00  2.2 \nA11: Additional Subprojects   41.72  17.46  59.18  21.6 \n         Subtotala  133.61  54.63  188.24  68.8 \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement    13.27  13.27  4.8 \nProject Implementation Consultancy  0.20  3.46  3.66  1.3 \nServices  \nTaxes and Duties    10.42  10.42  3.8 \nPart A Base Cost  133.81  81.78  215.59  78.8 \nPart B: NLDC Upgrade         \nB1: SCADA and Remote Terminals  13.89  3.00  16.89  6.2 \nB2: Telecommunication for SCADA  7.21  0.25  7.46  2.7 \n       Subtotala  21.10  3.25  24.35  8.9 \nProject Implementation Consultancy  0.20  1.01  1.21  0.4 \nServices  \nTaxes and Duties    2.16  2.16  0.8 \nPart B Base Cost  21.30  6.42  27.72  10.1 \nTotal Base Costa  155.11  88.20  243.31  88.9 \nFinancing Charges         \n  IDC (ADB loan)   14.41    14.41  5.3 \n  IDC (AFD loan)  5.08    5.08  1.9 \n  IDC (domestic loans)    10.83  10.83  3.9 \nTotal Financing Charges  19.49  10.83  30.32  11.1 \n         \n  Total Project Cost  174.60  99.03  273.63  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, IDC = interest during construction, \nkV = kilovolt, NLDC = national load dispatch center, SCADA = supervisory control and data acquisition. \na  Includes the physical and price contingencies of identified subprojects. \nSource: ADB estimates.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project involves a number of subprojects consisting of augmentation of the existing \ntransmission system at 500-kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV voltage levels and upgrading of the national \nload dispatch center. As these individual subprojects are not stand-alone investments and \nwould not yield benefits if considered in isolation, the financial analysis was conducted using a \ntime-slice approach for the entire northern region investment program. Hence the financial \nviability of the overall investment program in northern Viet Nam during the period 2004\u20132010, of \nwhich the subprojects to be financed under the project form part, has been assessed. The \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) is also calculated for the overall investment program \nin northern Viet Nam to be financed by Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) and was compared with the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  to  ascertain  the  financial  viability  of  the  investment \nprogram. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions was \nalso  assessed.  Based  on  this  analysis,  the  investment  program  in  northern  Viet  Nam  is \nfinancially viable. \n \nB.  Methodology \n \n2.  The financial analysis is carried out in a manner consistent with the assumptions in the \neconomic  analysis.  The  sales  forecast  and  the  without-investment  case  described  in  the \neconomic analysis are used for the purpose of evaluating the financial benefits attributable to \nthe investment program during 2004\u20132010. The financial cost of total system failure due to \nnoninvestment in north Viet Nam under the without-investment case, which is likely to happen \nafter 2007, has also not been considered in the financial analysis. \n \n3.  The revenues under the with-investment case are frozen when the system capacity \ninstalled during 2004\u20132010 is fully utilized. The incremental financial benefits attributable to the \ninvestment program consist of the difference between cash flows under the with-investment \ncase and the without-investment case. They are: \n \n(i)  the incremental sales over and above the curtailed sales under the without-\ninvestment case; \n(ii)  savings on transmission losses compared with the without-investment case due \nto higher energy flows from south to north under without-investment case; and \n(iii)  the difference in generation cost between the two scenarios. The plant dispatch \nunder the without-investment case is suboptimal and results in higher generation \ncost  on  a  per  unit,  i.e.,  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  basis.  However,  the  total \ngeneration cost under the with-investment case would be more than the without-\ninvestment case due to higher plant output to meet the higher demand. \n \nC.  Assumptions  \n \n4.  The financial analysis is carried out in real terms on an after-tax basis. The projected \ntariff increases shown in Appendix 7, Table A7.3 are applied after adjusting for inflation (i.e., \nadjusted tariffs are shown in the first column of Table A12.5). It is assumed that the tariff will \nremain constant in real terms after 2010. The prevailing fuel costs and power purchase prices \nare applied without any inflationary adjustments. The operation and maintenance costs and the \ncapital costs are based on EVN\u2019s estimates (from the Fifth Master Plan, 2002) and industry ", "Appendix 12  47 \nnorms. The capital expenditure program used in the analysis is shown in Table A12.1. The \ncapital expenses of investments scheduled for commissioning after 2010 are not included. \n \nTable A12.1: Capital Expenditure Program of Northern Viet Nam (2004\u20132010) \n(D billion) \n \nYear  Generation  Transmission  Distribution  Total \n2004  15,615  6,749  2,608  24,972 \n2005  8,785  5,827  2,528  17,140 \n2006  10,070  2,918  2,704  15,692 \n2007  10,424  1,069  3,040  14,533 \n2008  3,977  276  3,440  7,693 \n2009  1,160  119  3,872  5,151 \n2010    11  4,416  4,427 \n  Total  50,031  16,969  22,608  89,608 \nSource: PPTA Final Report, Table 2.6. \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n5.  WACC is calculated for the total investments in northern Viet Nam to be made by EVN \nduring  2004\u20132010.  It  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  will  consist  of  EVN\u2019s  equity \ncontribution financed through retained earnings and a combination of foreign and local currency \nloans. Based on expectations and EVN\u2019s historical cost of borrowing, the foreign and local \ncurrency loans earmarked for generation, transmission, and distribution are assumed to carry \ndifferent nominal interest rates. \n \n6.  The cost of EVN\u2019s equity is estimated using the capital asset pricing model. The risk-free \nrate is taken as 8.5% based on the prevailing rate of government bonds denominated in local \ncurrency. The market risk premium for Viet Nam is taken as 11% based on the average return \non listed companies in Viet Nam. The equity beta for EVN is estimated to be 0.85 based on the \nlisted power utilities in other developing countries. This results in a risk premium of 9.4% and a \nnominal cost of equity of 17.9%. The other assumptions are domestic inflation rate of 3%, \ninternational US dollar interest rate of 1%, tax rate of 32%, and 2.5% for the minimum interest \nrate test in view of prevailing low international interest rates. As shown in Table A12.2, WACC \nfor the investment program in northern Viet Nam during 2004\u20132010 is 6.86%. \n \nTable A12.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital Computation \n \n  Financing  Nominal  Weight  Tax Adj.

The annual financial benefits and costs attributable to the proposed investment program \nin  north  Viet  Nam  are  valued  as  explained  above  for  the  period  2004\u20132030. These were \ncalculated by taking the difference between sales, transmission losses, and operating costs \nunder the with- and without-investment scenarios. The difference in plant dispatch between the \ntwo scenarios is computed by simulating the plant dispatch under the two scenarios. The fuel \ncost and the purchase price from independent power producers are used in computing the \ngeneration cost under the two scenarios. The savings due to reduced transmission losses under \nthe  with-investment  case  compared  with  the  without-investment  case  are  captured  in  the \ndifference in generation cost between the two scenarios. The financial revenue flows due to \ndifference in operation and maintenance cost under the two scenarios are also included in the \nfinancial analysis. The net financial revenue flows are further adjusted for taxation by taking into \naccount the tax credit due to depreciation and interest cost. The net financial flows are shown in \nTable A12.5. \n \nTable A12.3: Comparison of With- and Without-Investment Scenarios \n(GWh) \n \n  With-Investment Scenario  Without-Investment Scenario \nYear    Sales        Generation    Losses    Sales          Generation      Losses \n2004  39,013  45,523  6,510  38,562  46,375  7,813 \n2005  45,040  53,439  8,399  43,607  53,438  9,831 \n2006  50,847  59,939  9,092  48,006  59,775  11,769 \n2007  57,430  67,919  10,489  52,515  67,122  14,607 \n2008  64,896  75,528  10,632  53,766  72,509  18,743 \n2009  73,368  82,779  9,411  59,001  78,639  19,638 \n2010  82,984  96,126  13,140  63,773  86,233  22,460 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  The differences in sales and generation cost under the two scenarios remain constant \nfrom  2011  as  system  capacity,  including  investments  made  during  2004\u20132010, are fully \nexhausted by 2010 and no further increases in sales are considered. Hence the financial flows \n(sales revenue, cost of generation and of operation and  maintenance) under both with- and \nwithout-investment scenarios remain constant from 2011. \n \n9.  All project benefits and costs were discounted at a discount rate equivalent to the WACC \nof the proposed investment program in north Viet Nam. The analysis was run over the period \nfrom 2004 to 2030 when the power plants built during 2004\u20132010 end their useful economic life. \nThe analysis indicates that the proposed investment program in north Viet Nam has an FIRR of \n12.82% compared with a WACC of 6.86% and a net present value (NPV) of D43.2 trillion when \ndiscounted at the WACC. \n  \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n10.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  and  the  NPV  to  several  adverse  movements  in  key \nassumptions has been computed to assess the robustness of the financial analysis. The NPV \nhas been calculated at a discount rate equal to the WACC.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the financial viability of the investment program in \nnorthern Viet Nam is sufficiently robust to withstand the adverse movements in the underlying \nassumptions. It is noted that the increased fuel cost improves the FIRR. This is because in the \nwith-investment case, the proposed hydro plants in northern Viet Nam displace some of the \nthermal plants. This results in larger financial savings compared with the without-investment \ncase when the fuel prices are increased from the base case. \n ", " \n \nTable A12.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return Computation  5\n0\n(D billion)   \n \n  Average Incremental  Incremental  Income Tax on      A\np\np\nYear  Tariff  Incremental  System  Revenue Flow  Incremental  Capital  Net Financial  e\nn\nD/kWh  Sales Revenue  Operation Cost  from Operations  Revenues  Expenditure  Benefits  d\nix\n2004  792  357  (325)  32  0  (24,973)  (24,941)   1\n2\n \n2005  802  1,149  (711)  438  0  (17,140)  (16,702) \n2006  882  2,505  (542)  1,963  0  (15,692)  (13,729) \n2007  908  4,462  2,374  6,836  0  (14,433)  (7,597) \n2008  920  10,240  (413)  9,827  (145)  (7,692)  1,990 \n2009  932  13,390  186  13,576  0  (5,150)  8,426 \n2010  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,267)  (4,427)  9772 \n2011  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,198)    14,268 \n2012  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,340)    14,126 \n2013  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,485)    13,981 \n2014  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,636)    13,830 \n2015  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,800)    13,666 \n2016  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (1,933)    13,533 \n2017  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (2,364)    13,101 \n2018  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (2,997)    12,469 \n2019  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (3,490)    11,976 \n2020  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (3,937)    11,529 \n2021  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,271)    11,194 \n2022  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,473)    10,992 \n2023  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,634)    10,832 \n2024  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,728)    10,738 \n2025  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,766)    10,700 \n2026  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,804)    10,662 \n2027  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,846)    10,620 \n2028  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,878)    10,588 \n2029  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (4,903)    10,562 \n2030  944  18,136  (2,670)  15,466  (5,777)    9,688 \n             \n          FIRR   12.86%\n          NPV at WACC  43,173 \nD = dong, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour, NPV = net present value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "Appendix 13  51 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The Project includes a series of individual subproject investments, including a 500-\nkilovolt (kV) transmission line and a number of substations. These investments form part of the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector investment program for the northern region. Since these individual \nsubprojects are not stand-alone investments and would not yield benefits if considered in \nisolation, the economic analysis was conducted using a time-slice approach for the entire \nnorthern region investment program. The investment program analyzed covers the period 2004 \nto 2010. This period defines all associated costs and benefits of meeting demand.  \n \nA.  Demand Forecast \n2.  Despite the global economic slowdown in the early 2000s, Viet Nam\u2019s economy has \nexperienced real annual growth rates of about 6.8%. While per capita consumption of electricity \nin Viet Nam1 is still among the lowest in Southeast Asia, average demand growth has been \naround 14% over the past decade. With an expected medium-term annual real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth of around 7%, electricity demand is predicted to continue to increase over \nthe coming years.  \n \n3.  The load forecasts used by EVN are developed by the Institute of Energy (IoE). These \nwere  updated  in  May  2003.2  The  key  force  driving  growth  in  electricity  demand  is  the \nassumption of a sustained GDP growth of around 7% per year. The forecasts show that the \nmarket share for industry increases significantly. This is consistent with the view that the \nindustry sector will be the main driver of economic growth. Demand growth in domestic sector \ndemand mainly stems from existing consumers as new connections are limited by the already \nhigh connection rates. Table A13.1 shows the increase in demand in the base case forecasts \nfor the northern region and the derived implicit elasticities.  \n \nTable A13.1: Load Forecast \n \n2000\u20132005  2005\u20132010  2010\u20132015  2015\u20132020 \nItem  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nSales GWh         \nIndustry  17.4  15.7  12.8  12.3 \nAgriculture  4.2  3.9  3.5  3.4 \nLighting  8.1  7.4  6.4  6.5 \nCommercial \u2013 Service  16.6  15.5  12.2  12.2 \nOther  11.9  11.7  10.3  10.4 \nGDP Growth Rates \nIndustry  10.3  9.0  8.1  9.2 \nAgriculture  3.2  2.9  3.0  3.1 \nCommercial \u2013 Service  8.9  8.5  7.0  7.4 \nImplied Elasticity \nIndustry  1.69  1.74  1.58  1.34 \nAgriculture  1.30  1.34  1.15  1.10 \nComm. \u2013 Service  1.86  1.82  1.74  1.65 \n                GDP = gross domestic product, GWh = gigawatt-hour. \n                Source: Calculations based on forecast in Fifth Master Plan Adjustment File, Ministry of Industry, 2002.. \n \n                                                 \n1  327 kWh per capita. \n2  The first forecasts were published in the original Fifth Master Plan from June 2000. Two revisions have since been \nmade in response to changes in the long-term economic outlook for Viet Nam. ", "52  Appendix 13 \nB.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n4.  The least-cost generation expansion analysis was carried out by IOE using the Wien \nAutomatic System Planning III (WASP III). Input data and assumptions were reviewed and \nfound appropriate. Fuel costs are based on international prices. A sensitivity analysis was \ncarried out by examining the impact of fuel price changes. The generation plan was found to be \nwell balanced in terms of least cost, the use of indigenous fuels, and diversity of fuels sources. \nDetails of the generation expansion program are provided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n5.  The least-cost analysis of the 500 kV transmission line accounted for the possibility that \nit may be cheaper to move coal by road to power stations. This analysis was carried out in \neconomic terms at border prices and includes costs for resettlement and environment mitigation \nmeasures. It shows that the transport cost for coal is higher than the cost of transmission of \nelectricity. Analysis with respect to least-cost alternatives for transmission voltages and the \nsizing of the 220 kV transformers were also undertaken for the substations. This analysis shows \nthat 500 kV is the least-cost voltage for the transmission line and that either 125-megavolt-\nampere (MVA) or 250 MVA transformers are the best size for the substations, depending on \nload growth.  \n \nC.  Economic Viability \n \n6.  The  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program  was  examined  on  the  basis  of \ncomparing costs and benefits of meeting demand growth as compared to a without-investment \nprogram scenario. The investment period covers the period 2004\u20132010. This period defines all \ncosts and benefits associated with the investment program.  \n \n7.  The  without-investment  scenario  assumes  that  there  will  be  no  investments  in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution in the northern region after 2003. Demand will be \nconstrained by capacity available prior to 2004 but accounts for the possibility of meeting \ndemand beyond 2004 from spare capacity. It is assumed that \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Vietnam (EVN) will \nkeep connecting consumers and meet demand until it either runs out of generation capacity or \nputs stress on the transmission system and threatens cascade collapse. To determine the \nwithout-investment  associated  costs,  load-flow  analysis  was  conducted  assuming  that  the \nexpansion program (generation, transmission, and distribution) in the north of the country is \nfrozen. The programs for the central and southern regions are allowed to continue. This will \nhave several direct consequences: \n \n(i)  losses in the northern region will rise. This is caused by the load growth requiring a \nhigher current to go through the existing system; \n(ii)  the fuel cost increases as generation plants with a higher dispatch cost are forced to \noperate for longer hours; and \n(iii)  increasing levels of unserved energy. \n \n8.  With the investment program, the demand constraint will occur at a later period and at \nhigher levels. Associated with the different demand levels in the with- and without-investment \ncases are capital expenditure, fuel, and operation and maintenance costs. Generation costs are \nbased on the Fifth Master Plan Adjustment File (MP5 AF) and on estimates derived from the \nWASP III analysis. Transmission costs for 500 kV and 200 kV and distribution costs (110 kV \nand below) are based on the MP5 AF. These costs were revised to include resettlement costs \nand load dispatch cost. Interest during construction (IDC), taxes, and duties were removed from ", "Appendix 13  53 \nthe capital expenditure and a conversion factor of 0.91 was applied to estimated local cost \nelements.  \n \n9.  The  quantified  economic  benefits  associated  with  the  with-investment  case  include \n(i) cost savings resulting from higher fuel costs of meeting demand in the without-investment \ncase, (ii) increased sales (since the load forecast will be severely constrained in the without-\ninvestment case), and (iii) cost savings associated with unserved energy.  \n \n10.  The approach taken to evaluate the benefits associated with incremental demand was to \ndetermine the area under the demand curve as the measure of willingness to pay (WTP) for \neach consumer group. This area is determined by taking two extreme points, where the first \npoint represents the present tariff and the revealed consumption  at this tariff. The second \nextreme point represents the maximum price that consumers would be willing to pay for \nelectricity. At prices higher than the maximum, consumers would avoid consuming electricity as \nthe benefits would be less than the costs. The maximum price is determined by considering the \nvalue added by electricity consumption. The levels of electricity consumption at the maximum \nprice  are  calculated  by  ensuring  equilibrium  between  cost  of  supply  and  the  benefits  of \nconsumption.  \n \n11.  For the domestic sector it is assumed that consumers have a choice between leisure \nand work where people would work up to the point where the marginal wage rate is equal to the \nmarginal value of leisure. With electricity, the value of leisure increases. Thus, the value of \nelectricity will be the loss of value, or welfare, of leisure caused by outage. For nondomestic \nconsumers it is assumed that production ceases if there is no electricity. Thus, consumers \nwould be willing to pay the amount up to the value added to avoid outage. Beyond this value, \nthe costs exceed the benefits. Thus, the value of lost electricity is the lost output caused by \noutage, where output for each sector is taken to be sector gross domestic product. Thus, the \ncost to consumers of unserved energy represents the price they would be willing to pay to avoid \noutage. However, since nondomestic consumers would not be willing to pay more than it would \ncost to run an isolated generator, an upper bound is set at the cost of self-generation. The \nbenefits  of  the  investment  program  associated  with  a  reduction  of  unserved  energy  are \nevaluated at the cost of unserved energy (COUE) for each consumer category. \n \n12.  Benefits associated with incremental demand are evaluated using a consumer surplus \nmeasure that reflects how much better off the consumers would be as a result of the price \nchange in electricity. The consumer surplus measure reflects the change in money income \nresulting from the price change that would be needed to leave the consumer equally well off as \ncompared to before the price change. This compensating welfare measure is used to define the \nWTP for each consumer category. The calculated WTPs were adjusted by the conversion factor \nsince they were estimated at the official US$ exchange rate. The WTP and COUE by consumer \ncategory  are  shown  in  Table A13.2  and  the  details  of  the  calculations  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nTable A13.2: Willingness to Pay \n \nConsumer Category  Willingness to Pay  COUE  \n($/kWh)  ($/kWh) \nIndustry  0.080  0.68a \nCommercial  0.067  0.49a \nAgricultural  0.069  0.16a \nDomestic Nonpoor  0.081  1.41 \nDomestic Poor  0.098  0.31 \nCOUE = cost of unserved energy, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  COUE for nondomestic consumers was capped by the cost of self-generation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  The economic analysis compares the costs and benefits associated with the with-\ninvestment program scenario with those of the without-investment program scenario. It is \nsummarized in Table A13.3 (below). All costs and benefits were discounted by a social discount \nfactor of 12%. The analysis shows that the investment program yields an EIRR of 40%, well \nabove the opportunity cost of capital. \n \n14.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to key risks and assumptions to \ninvestigate the robustness of the economic viability of the investment program. The analysis \ntakes into account a combination of adverse events. Particular concerns identified were related \nto the event that demand growth would not be realized. This may occur as a result of a global \neconomic downturn affecting the local economy or as a result of overestimation of income \nelasticities. The low-load scenario analyzed in the sensitivity analysis corresponds to a scenario \nwhere  the  income  elasticity  has  been  overestimated  by  50%  in  combination  with  a  50% \nreduction in GDP growth throughout the time period. In addition, the effect of an overestimation \nof the COUE estimates was analyzed. The sensitivity analysis assumed that the benefits \nassociated with COUE were overestimated by 50% and 100%, respectively. In addition, risks \nwith respect to adverse impacts of a combination of costs of capital expenditures, fuel, and \nindependent power producer energy purchase prices and operation and maintenance were \nanalyzed. The analysis shows that the investment program is economically worthwhile even \nunder these harsh sensitivity assumptions. The EIRR marginally falls below the opportunity cost \nof capital only in the most extreme adverse conditions (Table A13.4). A separate risk analysis \nwas also undertaken with respect to key factors. This analysis is detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix D. The results of the risk analysis show that the probability of the EIRR falling below \nthe opportunity cost of capital is negligible.  \n \nTable A13.4: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n  CAPEX  Fuel  O&M  IPP       \nLoad  (%)  Costs  Costs  Costs  COUE  EIRR  NPV  \nGrowth  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  ($ million) \nBase   Base  Base  Base  Base  Base  40  12,073 \n    -20        29  5,933 \nLow            26  5,251 \nLow  +20  -20  +20  +20  -50  19  2,691 \nLow  +30  -30  +30  +30  -50  16  4,165 \nLow  +30  -30  +30  +30  -100  11  -282 \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, COUE = cost of unserved energy, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, \nIPP = independent power producer, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?  Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam has made remarkable progress in providing electricity services to the population.  This is a key objective in \nthe Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The share of households with access to electricity \nincreased from 49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002. Demand for electricity has increased substantially in the last decade with \nincreasing incomes and reduced poverty. This has increased household affordability of appliances and electricity \nservices. However, annual per capita consumption remains among the lowest in Asia at about 321 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh). Utilization of households is even lower, about 158 kWh per year or 13 kWh per month. \n \nReliable and good quality of electricity supply is key for economic growth and poverty reduction. Electricity supply \npromotes alternative sources of income that reduce the  vulnerability of households to falling below the poverty line. \nAccess to electricity has substantial expenditure-reducing effects, which is particularly important for poor households. \nThe poorest households in Viet Nam with access to electricity spend less than 2% of their total spending on electricity. \nThis is low compared with other countries in the region. Reduced expenditure on electricity allows households to use \nmore expenditure for food and education and health services. Access to electricity also reduces the workload of \nwomen in food processing and collecting water. Irrigation using electricity reduces input cost for farmers and increases \nagricultural productivity. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nThe poverty analysis for the Project was conducted to identify issues and assess impacts on the sector level since it \nwas difficult to identify specific end-beneficiaries. Field assessments and consultations were conducted in both rural \nand urban areas within the impact area of the Project. This was supplemented by data analysis from the 2002 Viet \nNam Living Standard survey (VLSS 2002) and Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) consumption and connection cost data. A \nreview of EVN\u2019s business practices was conducted to identify possible barriers for the poor to connect. These were \nthen discussed with the poor themselves and with the provincial people\u2019s committees in the project areas. \n \nVLSS 2002 shows that the national incidence of poverty has been reduced from 37% to 29%. Poverty headcounts in \nthe provinces located in the Project area ranges form 47.7% in Nge An  to 15.2% in Hanoi. The share of poor \nhouseholds reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting in the project areas ranges from 75% to 95%. The \nratio of rural to urban beneficiaries is about 1:4. This means that the majority of project benefits will accrue to urban \nareas where poverty incidences are generally lower. But with strong rural-urban links, increasing urban migration \n(particularly of females who make up an increasing proportion of migrants), and remittances, indirect impacts in terms \nof employment and income effects of the Project are expected to benefit poor households in rural areas. Reducing \nunemployment and underemployment in both rural and urban areas will be key for sustaining the poverty reduction \neffects of economic growth. Formal sector employment opportunities need to be expanded to absorb new entrants into \nthe labor market. \n \nThe high share of households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting suggests that a majority of the \npoor are connected. It can be assumed that the remaining households are the very poor and live either in very remote \nareas with no grid-access or far from the community center and the main grid. Special efforts will be needed to \nconnect these households in terms of investments, management of local networks and in terms of addressing \naffordability, in particular that of up-front charges. Some donor funded programs exist that address up-front charges. \nBut they are limited to specific project areas. \n \nThe level of electricity consumption is normally strongly correlated with income. This is mainly because as household \nincomes rise, affordability of appliances increases. Poor households thus consume smaller amounts than nonpoor. \nThe very poor are often limited to using one or two light bulbs and sometimes a fan. Consumption levels range from \n2 kWh per month for the very poor to around 20\u201330 kWh for the poor just below and above the poverty line. The near-\npoor and poor just below the poverty line have some affordability of appliances and may even have a TV. Of the \npoorest income quintile, 17% reported having a color TV. However, these appliances, while cheap in terms of capital \ncosts, are second hand and inefficient in electricity usage and thus more expensive in running costs. Despite these \nlow consumption levels, electricity is a priority for poor households. This is reflected in the fact that they are willing to \nsell an animal, and thus deplete savings, to pay for up-front connection charges. Thus, the value of just a few kWh of \nelectricity consumption in terms of enhancing the quality of life is large from the household perspective. Most ", "Appendix 14  57 \nelectricity consumption in terms of enhancing the quality of life is large from the household perspective. Most \nhouseholds use electricity for domestic activities such as lighting, water pump, TV, and radio. Very few of the poor use \nelectricity for own-business activities. Access to the grid also has large expenditure-reducing effects for poor \nhouseholds and allows them to become more energy efficient, using fewer kWh. \n \nHowever, in rural areas electricity services are not always reliable and of good quality. This is due to the rapid \nexpansion of the electricity network, poor local network management, and poor and long wiring from the pole to the \nhouse in rural areas. The sector will need to make substantial investments to meet the increasing demand from the \nresidential sector. High losses and inadequate power supply remain a burden for many of the connected rural \nconsumers. Unreliable services and voltage fluctuations reduce some of the benefits of electricity. First, electricity \nusage for income-earning activities in agriculture and small-scale commercial activities are adversely affected with a \nconsequent loss in income. Second, voltage fluctuations reduce the life time of appliances and increase the total cost \nof using electricity. This will deter consumers from purchasing appliances and using electricity in an optimal way. \nThird, when electricity is unreliable some households will resort to alternative but more expensive sources of supply \nwith a consequent impact on expenditure. These effects will worsen if investments are not made to increase quality \nand quantity of supply. Box A14.2 illustrates the effects of low voltage. \n \nIn urban areas, the requirement of formal registration cards is a key barrier for poor informal migrants, often from rural \nareas, to connect directly to EVN\u2019s services. This has created a market for \u201cmiddle-men\u201d, or meter landlords who buy \nelectricity from EVN and on-sell to end-consumers at higher prices. This depletes the intention of the substantial \nsubsidies on the lowest tariff category. \n \nSubsidies in the sector are better able to reach the poor in Viet Nam than in most other countries in the region. This is \nbecause of the high connection rates, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, the poor do not receive the full benefit \nof subsidies due to the existence of meter landlords. The design of the tariff structure and the overall subsidy level is \nnot particularly pro-poor. All residential consumer categories are heavily subsidized, including the nonpoor, which \nimposes an opportunity cost that could have been used for alternative activities to reduce poverty. It would be \nimportant to reduce subsidies in the sector and to target the subsidy to the poor\u2019s consumption bracket.  \n \nAffordability of up-front charges and monthly charges among the ethnic minorities living in the project area remains an \nissue. Poverty incidences and the depth of poverty remain higher among the ethnic minorities than for the Kinh.  \n \nThe poverty analysis has been summarized in a Poverty Impact Matrix (Table A14). \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes. A stakeholder analysis was undertaken during resettlement planning.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? There is a participation strategy for resettlement planning and implementation as \ndescribed in the summary resettlement action plan (RAP) and resettlement framework. \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAll data collected during the inventory of loss and socioeconomic survey for resettlement planning were gender \ndisaggregated. The assessment shows that women are not disadvantaged in terms of education and literacy. \nWomen\u2019s names appear with their husbands in the Red Book giving formal right to the use of lands and rights \nassociated therewith. Women may be disadvantaged in that they may not speak out about resettlement-related \ngrievances. This will  be taken into account and the grievance procedures will be strengthened in this regard. During \nresettlement implementation, special attention will continue to be paid to the particular needs of women, particularly \nany special needs of women-headed households. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
