Investment Program Summary\nThe project will support the Government of Bangladesh in constructing the 102-kilometer (km) Dohazari-Cox's Bazar section of \nthe Chittagong-Cox's Bazar railway corridor in southeastern Bangladesh.  The government is rehabilitating the 47-km \nChittagong-Dohazari section with its own funds. The project will also strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh Railway for project \nimplementation management. The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade facilitation and transport \nworking group endorsed the project at a meeting held in Tokyo on 26 November 2015.\nThe government has requested for an multitranche financing facility (MFF) in an amount up to $1.5 billion from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and Special Fund resources to help finance the project. An MFF using the time-slicing approach is \nproposed as the modality to finance this large-scale stand-alone project through long-term works, goods and services, and \nconsultant contracts. The project was fully appraised as part of the due diligence for the MFF, and each tranche will finance \nparts of this project. The MFF allows a long-term partnership with the government for policy dialogue and capacity development.\nImpact: Efficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh and improved subregional connectivity and trade \nOutcome: Railway transport system in the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar corridor improved \nOutputs: (i) New railway line commissioned,  and (ii) Project implementation capacity of Bangladesh Railway strengthened\nImplementation Arrangements: Bangladesh Railway will be the executing agency.\nProject Readiness: Consultants recruited under the Subregional Transport Project Preparatory Facility  prepared the project's \ndesign, which considered engineering design measures to minimize the need for land acquisition and resettlement. Given that \nBangladesh is a low-lying country and the project area experiences high rainfall, the main climate change-related impact on the \nproject is increased flooding and river flow volumes due to more rainfall. Embankment height, drainage structure design, and \nbridge height were adjusted to account for these impacts.\nBangladesh Railway's capacity to operate and maintain assets was strengthened by updating several operations manuals as \npart of the railway reform project. Bangladesh Railway will maintain all assets financed under this loan in such a way that they \nare available for safe railway operation, and will establish a dedicated maintenance unit for the new line.\n12.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway Project, Phase 1. \nThe report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Project Implementation \nManagement,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the proposed  MFF,  I,  acting  under the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Bangladesh in constructing the 102-kilometer \n(km)  Dohazari\u2013Cox\u2019s  Bazar  section  of  the  Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s  Bazar  railway  corridor  in \nsoutheastern Bangladesh.1 The government is rehabilitating the 47-km Chittagong\u2013Dohazari \nsection with its own funds. The project will also strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh Railway \nfor project implementation management. The SASEC trade facilitation and transport working \ngroup endorsed the project at a meeting held in Tokyo on 26 November 2015.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal. Bangladesh is also located at the main corridor of the Trans-Asia Railway network linking \nSouth and Southeast Asia. Nonetheless, railways account for a low market share in subregional \ntransport. Only 11.9% of Bangladesh\u2019s imports from India (876,855 tons) and 1.1% of its exports \nto India (17,832 tons) in 2011 were transported by rail. Only one passenger train operating twice \na week links Dhaka with Kolkata, India. On average, only one freight train per day crosses the \nborder. Major constraints in subregional rail connectivity are the lack of connectivity between the \nrail networks, the differences between the track gauges in the member states, incompatibilities \nin rolling stock, limited line capacity, and the overall condition of the rail network in Bangladesh. \n \n4.  The  project  will  connect  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  district  for  the  first  time  to  the  national  and \nsubregional railway network, and support efficient development in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s \nBazar\u2013Myanmar border corridor through improved, reliable, safe, and environmentally friendly \nrailway  connectivity,  contributing to the  overall  development  of  the  national  economy.  The \nrailway corridor is part of the Trans-Asia Railway network and will facilitate access for the Cox\u2019s \nBazar district\u2019s population and products to subregional markets and trade. The project will \nimprove  connectivity  toward  Myanmar  by  intermodal  facilities  for  passengers  and  freight \ntransferring to road transport toward the Myanmar border. The project will be constructed in \ndual-gauge tracks to enable future direct connectivity toward western Bangladesh and India, \nwhere railways are constructed mostly in broad gauge, as well as toward northeastern India and \nSoutheast Asia, where railways are mostly constructed in meter gauge. \n \n5.  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  is  being  developed  to  become  a  major  domestic  and  regional  tourist \ndestination. Tourism in Cox\u2019s Bazar is expected to grow by at least 5% annually and the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  intends  to  develop  the  district  into  a  regional  tourist  hub  and \nseaside resort, and other areas of the district and the Chittagong Hill Tracts into eco-tourist \ndestinations. Developing tourism in Cox\u2019s Bazar is expected to contribute significantly to the \ndistrict\u2019s economic growth and create jobs in tourism and supporting industries. But tourists can \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA under the Subregional Transport Project \nPreparatory Facility (TA loan 2688-BAN). \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \ntravel to the district only by road via the two-lane national highway or on a very limited scale by \nair; most tourists use the bus and come from Bangladesh\u2019s urban centers, such as Dhaka \n(located 470 km north of Cox\u2019s Bazar), Comilla, and Chittagong. Each year, around 1.875 \nmillion tourists visit Cox\u2019s Bazar and stay in the district\u2019s more than 200 hotels and numerous \nguesthouses and dormitories. Annually, more than 9 million bus trips are made to the district \nfrom Chittagong alone. It is expected that the railway will serve as an alternative mode of \ntransport for about 50% of trips currently using buses. Through this modal shift from road to rail, \nthe project will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve road safety. Special tourist \ntrains will be operated between Dhaka and Cox\u2019s Bazar to accommodate the demand. \n \n6.  In addition, significant local demand from the district\u2019s population of about 2.2 million is \nexpected from trips related to work, educational, social, medical, and administrative reasons. To \naccommodate this local demand, all train stations will be equipped with multimodal facilities, and \nlocal as well as mail trains will operate on the line. Inbound freight demand is expected mainly \nfrom supplies for the district and its tourism industry, while outbound freight will carry goods \nfrom the district, such as salt, fish products, and timber. The project will also facilitate access to \ninvestments by other development partners, such as Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s \n(JICA) planned power plant and deep-sea port in Matarbari Island near Cox\u2019s Bazar. \n \n7.  Road map. The government\u2019s Vision 2021 lays out development targets that would help \nBangladesh reach middle-income status by its 50th anniversary in 2021.3 To achieve this, the \n7th Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 (the seventh plan) aims to accelerate economic growth, \nemployment generation, and poverty reduction; and intends to raise the annual average growth \nrate to 7.4%.4 The project is part of the government\u2019s strategy to connect more districts of the \ncountry to the railway network. It will further support the objectives to (i) generate employment \nby developing Cox\u2019s Bazar\u2019s tourism industry; (ii) improve subregional connectivity and trade; \n(iii) increase the market share of the railway system, especially for long-distance passenger and \nfreight traffic; and (iv) improve the integration of different modes of transport. \n \n8.  Strategic context. The seventh plan includes the improvement of railways as energy-\nefficient  multimodal  transport  systems  to  reduce  carbon  emissions.  It  also  refers  to  the \nestablishment  of  proper  regional  rail  connectivity  as  a  major  investment  priority.  The \ngovernment\u2019s strategy in the seventh plan is to increase Bangladesh Railway\u2019s market share \nfrom 4% to 15% in freight transport, and from 4% to 10% in passenger transport. The railway \nwill focus on lucrative market segments and provide long-distance passenger transport by \nintercity trains as well as long-haul freight transport and container trains. The subsector policies \nfor rail transport are set out in the National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy, which states \nthat the railway can help avoid the construction of roads by attracting current and future road \nusers through improvements in long-distance intercity train service quality, timetabling, and \ncapacity.5 The  Railway  Master  Plan  pointed  out  that  the  rail  transport  subsector  must \nsignificantly  improve  its  efficiency,  service  quality,  intermodal  connectivity,  and  network \ncoverage to serve as a viable mode of transport.6  \n \n9.  Policy framework. To ensure the sustainability of the project, Bangladesh Railway will \npursue ongoing reforms by (i) improving its accounting; (ii) implementing annual adjustments to \nthe passenger and freight tariff; (iii) fully operationalizing the container company to increase the \n                                                \n3  Centre for Policy Dialogue. 2007.

Railway reform. The sector reform framework agreed between the government and \nADB, JICA and the World Bank formulated a detailed reform program. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)-financed  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  provided  support  for  the \nimplementation of these key sector policy, organizational, and capacity-building reforms to make \nthe state-owned Bangladesh Railway more commercially focused, and improve governance and \naccountability. 7  It  restructured  Bangladesh  Railway  into  a  lines-of-business  structure; \nestablished  an  accounting  system  based  on  this  structure;  and  introduced  an  information \ntechnology system to support enterprise resource planning and improve asset management, \nfinancial management and governance, accounting systems, and human resource utilization \nand governance. The full rollout of the enterprise resource planning system is ongoing; it is \nexpected that FY2017 financial statements for Bangladesh Railway can be prepared by the \nsystem. Reforming the railway industry in addition to investing in increased transport capacity is \none of the priorities of the government under the seventh plan. As a first step in transforming \nitself into a more commercially focused transport service provider, Bangladesh Railway set up a \ncontainer company in April 2016 to handle the container business as a government-owned \ncorporate entity in close coordination with private sector clients, especially from the garments \nand logistics industries. A tariff reform was introduced in February 2016, which rationalized the \npassenger and freight tariff and provides for annual tariff adjustments based on cost indicators. \nA detailed description of the railway reform activities is in the railway reform progress report.8 \n \n11.  Investment program. The project has been identified as one of the priorities in the \nseventh plan and the Railway Master Plan. It will focus on financing the construction of the 102 \nkm Dohazari\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar section as phase 1 of the planned improvement for the Chittagong\u2013\nCox\u2019s Bazar railway corridor. The Government of the Republic of Korea plans to finance the \nreplacement of the road cum railway bridge over Karnaphuli River in Chittagong. The project \ndesign  includes  provisions for future  capacity  enhancement,  and  extensions  of the  line  to \nGundam at the Myanmar border and to the planned deep-sea port on Matarbari Island. These \nfuture extensions are expected to be financed under phase 2 of the proposed project. The dual-\ngauge conversion of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong section will be financed under a future ADB project. \nThe project will also continue to support the implementation of the railway reform program. \n \n12.  ADB-financed railway projects. The Railway Sector Investment Program (Footnote 7) \nfinances (i) the double tracking of the 64 km Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section of the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong corridor (ii) the extension of loop lines and modernization of signaling in the Ishurdi\u2013\nDarsana section; and (iii) the procurement of 150 passenger carriages. In 2014, ADB approved \nthe SASEC Railway Connectivity: Akhaura\u2013Laksam Double Track Project, which is cofinanced \nby the European Investment Bank.9 It will upgrade the 72 km Akhaura\u2013Laksam section of the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor to a double track railway line with modern signaling equipment.

Development coordination. In the Bangladesh rail transport subsector, interventions by \nkey development partners are well-coordinated. The sector reform framework agreed by the \ngovernment, ADB, JICA and the World Bank is supported by the ADB-financed Railway Sector \nInvestment Program (Footnote 7) and provides a platform for institutional development as basis \nfor infrastructure financing investment programs. Infrastructure investments are concentrating \non the two key rail corridors, Dhaka\u2013Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar and Dhaka\u2013Khulna. In addition to \nthe ADB-financed projects, JICA financed (i) double tracking of the 61 km Laksam\u2013Chinki \nAstana section of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor; (ii) remodeling of the Chittagong station yard; \nand  (iii)  procurement  of  11  diesel  locomotives  The  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  prepares \nfinancing (i) the improvement of the signaling system in the Chinki Astana\u2013Chittagong section; \n(ii) procurement rolling stock; and (iii) the new Karnaphuli river road cum railway bridge in \nChittagong. The Government of India is supporting (i) construction of the second Bhairab Bridge \nand the second Titas Bridge in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor; (ii) procurement of passenger \ncoaches, freight wagons, and locomotives; (iii) construction of the Kulna\u2013Mongla Port Rail Line; \n(iv) construction of the third and fourth dual-gauge track between Dhaka and Tongi; and (v) \nrehabilitation of the Kulaura\u2013Shahbazpur section. JICA is supporting design for construction of \nthe new Jamuna railway bridge in the Dhaka\u2013Khulna corridor. \n \n14.  Investment plan and MFF modality. The government has requested for an MFF in an \namount up to $1.5 billion from ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. An MFF using the time-slicing approach is proposed as \nthe modality to finance this large-scale stand-alone project through long-term works, goods, and \nservices; and consultant contracts. The project was fully appraised as part of the due diligence \nfor the MFF, and each tranche will finance parts of this project. The MFF allows a long-term \npartnership with the government for policy dialogue and capacity development. Once a tranche \nis disbursed, the government will submit a periodic financing request for a subsequent tranche, \nwhich will continue to finance the contracts awarded under tranche 1. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the project will be efficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh and \nimproved subregional connectivity and trade. The outcome will be improved railway transport \nsystem in the Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar corridor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The  project  will  support  (i)  the  construction  of  a  new  railway  line  and  (ii)  the \nstrengthening of the project implementation capacity of Bangladesh Railway. For the first output, \n102 km of new railway line will be commissioned, with nine stations, integrating design features \nthat are friendly to elderly people, women, children, and people with disabilities. The second \noutput will involve implementation of a safeguard monitoring system, public communication plan, \nand safety awareness. Tranche 1 will finance part of the construction contract for the project. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2015.

The government has requested ADB financing through an MFF in an amount up to \n$1,500,000,000 or 74.6% of the project cost from ADB's ordinary capital resources and Special \nFunds  resources.12 The MFF  will  consist  of  several  tranches,  subject  to  the government's \nsubmission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan agreements for \neach  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing  agreement.  Each  tranche  will finance  parts  of the  works, goods,  and \nservices;  and  consulting  services  contracts  using  the  time-slicing  approach  for  large-scale \nstand-alone  projects.  Once  a  tranche  is  disbursed,  the  government  will  submit  a  periodic \nfinancing request for a subsequent tranche, which will continue to finance the contracts awarded \nunder tranche 1. \n \n19.  For  the  first  tranche  of  the  MFF,  the  government  has  requested  an  OCR  loan  of \n$210 million and a loan in various currencies equivalent to  SDR64.374 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources.13 The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,14 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft OCR loan agreement. The loan from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of \n                                                \n12  Financing includes taxes and duties of about $115 million for civil works, to help offset the financial burden of \ncounterpart funds by the government, especially for land acquisition and resettlement. The amount is within the \nreasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process, is not excessive \n(7.67% of ADB loan resources), applies only to ADB-financed expenditures, and is material and relevant to the \nsuccess of the project. \n13  The loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources includes $40 million from the subregional pool. The OCR loan \nincludes $100 million from the regional cooperation and integration set-aside. \n14  The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n ", "6 \n2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft special funds resources loan agreement. \n \n20.  The proposed tranching schedule and financing plan is in Table 2.15 The government will \nfinance  the  remaining  cost  equivalent  to  $512  million,  including  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, project management, and other miscellaneous costs.

If such \ncofinancing becomes available, it will be on a parallel basis and not administered by ADB. \n16  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nBangladesh Railway has sound experience in procurement and contract management under \nADB  financing.  ADB  will  play  an  active  facilitation  role  in  the  bidding  process  to  ensure \ntimeliness and quality in the process, and will engage its own consultants to help with this work. \nConstruction supervision and project management support will require two consultants, which \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). All consulting services will be recruited using the 90:10 quality- and \ncost-based selection method, considering the complexity of multidisciplinary railway projects. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n23.  Capacity  development  TA  for  project  implementation  management  will  be  provided \nunder the first tranche.17 The TA  will  support  Bangladesh  Railway  (i)  in  the monitoring  of \nsafeguards  implementation  by  an  independent  external  monitor  for  environment  and \nresettlement, (ii) in public stakeholder communication through development of a website, (iii) in \na safety awareness campaign for railway crossings, and (iv) through procurement support and \nadvisory  services.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  Bangladesh  Railway.  The  TA \nimplementation period will be from January 2017 to December 2024. \n \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, \nreports, and other logistical support and in-kind contributions. ADB will engage national and \ninternational consulting firms as well as individual consultants according to its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, using the 90:10 quality- and cost-based selection method due to the highly \nspecialized knowledge required for the railway sector. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  Consultants recruited under the Subregional Transport Project Preparatory Facility18 \nprepared the project\u2019s design, which considered engineering design measures to minimize the \nneed for land acquisition and resettlement. Given that Bangladesh is a low-lying country and the \nproject area experiences high rainfall, the main climate change-related impact on the project is \nincreased flooding and river flow volumes due to more rainfall. Embankment height, drainage \nstructure design, and bridge height were adjusted to account for these impacts. Bangladesh \nRailway\u2019s  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  assets  was  strengthened  by  updating  several \noperations manuals as part of the railway reform project. Bangladesh Railway will maintain all \nassets financed under this loan in such a way that they are available for safe railway operation, \nand will establish a dedicated maintenance unit for the new line. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic and financial analyses were undertaken and concluded that the project is \neconomically and financially viable. The project economic internal rate of return is 14.8%. The \neconomic  analysis  compared  the  benefits  and  costs  of  with-project  and  without-project \nsituations. The main benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time, and a \nreduction in accidents. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in \nthe key parameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The analysis indicates that \n                                                \n17 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Subregional Transport Project Preparatory Facility. Manila. \n ", "8 \nthe project\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. The \nfinancial assessment was undertaken to examine the viability of the project investment. The \nincremental revenues being generated under the project will be adequate to fully finance the \nproject\u2019s incremental recurrent costs, and partially contribute to capital repayment and debt \nservicing. The project\u2019s lending decision is based more on economic viability than financial \nviability.  Overall,  Bangladesh  Railway\u2019s  operations  are  supported  by  the  government\u2019s \nbudgetary  commitment;  the  yearly  government  support  is  adequate  to  sustain  operations, \nreflecting the systemic importance of Bangladesh Railway. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Financial management. The financial management assessment was updated following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,19 Financial  Due \nDiligence: a Methodology Note,20 and related technical guidance notes. The assessment found \nthat the capacity is adequate and the overall risk is moderate. Bangladesh Railway has prior \nand ongoing experience in implementing ADB projects, and understands ADB\u2019s procurement, \ndisbursement,  and financial  management  procedures. The  capacity  is further  strengthened \nthrough the Bangladesh Railway Reform Project by improving the financial accounting and \nreporting system.21 Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM (footnote 16). \n \n28.  Procurement  and  anticorruption  measures.  ADB  will  review  procurement-related \ndocuments at all major milestones before proceeding with the procurement process. Two large \nworks  packages  will  be  procured  and two  consultants  recruited; the works  and  consulting \npackages will be to complete the entire project, and will be financed by ADB under tranche 1 \nand all subsequent tranches. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and Bangladesh Railway. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \n29.  The procurement rules for the selection of contractors required by international financial \ninstitutions  such  as  ADB  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to  deter  corruption.  National \nprocurement regulation has also improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006 and the \nrelated Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (with subsequent amendments); and the establishment \nof a Central Procurement Technical Unit under the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation \nDivision of the Ministry of Planning of the Government of Bangladesh. In October 2012, the \nNational Integrity Strategy (NIS) was approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was \nformed with the Prime Minister as the chair to steer the anticorruption movement and implement \nthe  strategy.  The  NIS  includes  a  road  map  for  strengthening  both  state  and  non-state \naccountability institutions to fight corruption and improve governance. Under the NIS, all line \nministries and key watchdog institutions have formed an ethics committee and appointed a focal \npoint  to  implement  a  corruption  prevention  program  and  corresponding  actions  in  their \nrespective ministries or agencies. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  The project\u2019s direct area of influence includes six administrative upazilas (subdistricts) in \nChittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar districts.22 Overall, poverty rates in the project area are lower \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n20 ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n21 The Bangladesh Railway Reform Project is financed under tranche 1 of the Railway Sector Investment Program \n(footnote 7). \n22 Chandanaish, Lohagara, and Satkania in Chittagong district; and Chakaria, Cox\u2019s Bazar Sadar, and Ramu in Cox\u2019s \nBazar district. Estimates are based on the 1991 population census, taking population growth into account. \n ", "9 \n(13%\u201334%) than the national average (31.5%).23 According to the poverty and social analysis, \nthe main sources of income are agriculture, businesses, remittances, day labor, and services. \nTourism is important and growing; Cox\u2019s Bazar\u2019s 120 km of sandy beaches make it one of the \nmost visited destinations in the country. The project will improve accessibility for the estimated \n2 million residents living in the project\u2019s direct area of influence (who do not have access to the \nrailway system at present) and support the growth of businesses, trade, and services. \n \n31.  Gender. Surveys conducted under the poverty and social analysis revealed that only 5% \nof women in the project-affected area have used the train, since no rail connection exists \nbetween Dohazari and Cox\u2019s Bazar. Overall, women had a positive perception of the project \nand the majority (61%) said they would feel comfortable traveling alone on a train. Moreover, \n50% of the women viewed the new train  line as a way for them to access new income-\ngeneration opportunities. But 44% expressed concerns about their personal safety, particularly \nin relation to theft and harassment, while others were worried about train delays. \n \n32.  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  Although  district  data  on  HIV  prevalence  for \nChittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar is lacking, health officials have pointed out that tourism and cross-\nborder  population  movements  may  have  increased  the  incidence  of  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases. As for human trafficking, while neither local data nor nationally collected data exist on \nthe number of trafficked persons to and from Bangladesh, discussions with community-based \norganizations during project preparation indicate the existence of people smuggling in Cox\u2019s \nBazar, which is near the Myanmar border. Although the project is not expected to facilitate \ninternational human trafficking given that train services are subject to greater control than the \ncurrent routes used by the traffickers, it may contribute to more rural\u2013urban migration flows. \nThese migrants may then be vulnerable to being coerced and exploited by organized traffickers. \n \n33.  Rail  crossing  safety.  Given  that  the  project  consists  of  a  new  line  located  in  a \ncommunity  that  is  not used to  train  services,  the risk  of train  collisions  with  vehicles  and \npedestrians is high\u2014residents and drivers along the corridor may not be aware of the train\u2019s \nbraking limitations (compared with vehicles) and the need to clear the rail tracks in advance. \n \n34.  Gender  action  plan.  The MFF and tranche 1 are categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared for tranche 1 and the MFF to ensure \nwomen-friendly design features and mitigate the social risks mentioned above. The action plan \nincludes the following activities: (i) integrate features that would make the stations friendly to \nelderly people, women, children, and people with disabilities; (ii) promote rail crossing safety \nawareness campaigns to communities along the corridor, targeting pedestrians, drivers, parents, \nschoolchildren,  and  professional  drivers;  (iii)  include  personal  safety  and/or  anti-sexual \nharassment protocol in station and capacity building; (iv) run a public, preventive awareness-\nraising campaign on sexually transmitted disease and human trafficking; (v) take proactive \nmeasures  to  support  the  rehabilitation  of  affected  women;  (vi)  launch  a  website  and \ncommunication platform about the project, its impact, and its implementation progress. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environmental  impact.  The  project  as  a  whole  was  assessed  as  category  A  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project scope includes the \nconstruction of a greenfield rail line passing through elephant crossings and three protected \nareas (Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary, Faisakhali Wildlife Sanctuary, and Methakatchpia National \n                                                \n23 Government  of  Bangladesh,  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2011.  Report  of  the  Household  Income  & \nExpenditure Survey 2010. Dhaka. \n ", "10 \nPark). Accordingly, tranche 1 and all subsequent tranches will be classified as category A. An \nenvironmental impact assessment was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 26 May \n2016. An environmental assessment and review framework was also prepared for the MFF as a \nwhole and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Key impacts during project construction will include the \nremoval of about 240,000 trees, earthworks, and hill cutting works that pose dust and erosion \nrisks, occupational health and safety risks, disturbance to elephants, and further disturbances to \nthe three protected areas. Creating a barrier to elephant crossing routes and generating noise \nfrom the new rail line are key long-term risks. A comprehensive environmental management \nplan (EMP) was prepared to mitigate all identified impacts. It will be mandatory for the contractor \nto implement the EMP requirements during construction. Innovative measures such as elephant \noverpasses, use of thermal imaging cameras, and habitat enhancement have been proposed to \navoid rail\u2013elephant collisions and enable continued movement of elephants in the project area. \nExtensive consultations were held with over 350 people during project preparation, including \npeople affected by the project, relevant government agencies,24 local women\u2019s groups, and \nnongovernment organizations. Their concerns were incorporated in the project design. The \nproject will continue to address concerns and grievances of affected people through a grievance \nredress mechanism proposed under the project. \n \n36.  A project implementation unit in Chittagong will manage on-site project implementation, \nwith support from the project management and construction supervision consultants; all will \nhave environment safeguard officers. The contractor will be responsible for implementing the \nEMP. An independent monitor to be recruited under the TA will conduct third-party monitoring of \nenvironmental safeguards and provide technical guidance on the elephant crossing design. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  as  a  whole  was  assessed  as  category  A; \naccordingly, tranche 1 and all subsequent tranches will be classified as category A as per ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  detailed  survey  of  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  was \nconducted,  which  identified  the  acquisition  of  562.83  hectares  of  land  and  impacts  on \n1,984 households (9,946 persons), the majority of whom (80%) will have to physically relocate. \nMost  affected  households  (65%)  are  titleholders.  About  80%  of  physically  affected  titled \nhouseholds will lose less than 30% of their land and will be able to relocate their homestead to \ntheir residual plot. The project is also expected to affect 44 community structures.  \n \n38.  The resettlement plan was designed using a participatory approach, which led to several \nrealignments and design changes. Its measures adequately deal with the identified impacts and \nreflect lessons learned from other projects being implemented in Bangladesh. The resettlement \nplan includes compensations at replacement cost, income restoration measures, shifting and \nreconstruction  assistance,  special  provisions  for  vulnerable  households,  and  assistance  in \nidentifying  alternative  plots  of  land  to  buy  or  rent.  In  addition,  it  includes  a  livelihood \nimprovement  program  with  special  measures  to  encourage  women\u2019s  participation.  The \nresettlement plan will be financed entirely by the government, and its budget has been approved. \nIt will be implemented by Bangladesh Railway, with support from a nongovernment organization. \nBangladesh  Railway  is  familiar  and  experienced  with  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \nrequirements,  as  it  is conducting  land  acquisition  and resettlement  activities for  two  ADB-\nfinanced investments (footnote 7 and footnote 9). Measures to develop Bangladesh Railway\u2019s \ncapacity will be included as part of project inception. The resettlement plan is disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website25 and will be disclosed by Bangladesh Railway locally as well. Since the project \n                                                \n24 This includes forestry officials responsible for the three protected areas in the project area. The forestry officials \nsupport the project, and their technical recommendations were incorporated in the project. \n25 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nis financed through an MFF modality, a resettlement framework was prepared and is also \ndisclosed.26 \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples. The MFF and tranche 1 are classified as category C as per the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The alignment does not affect tribal lands, and the survey confirms \nthat no indigenous person is affected. Given that the project will be financed through an MFF, \nan indigenous peoples planning framework was prepared and disclosed.27 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Key  project  risks  are  (i)  project  implementation  delays,  (ii)  inadequate  safeguard \ncompliance, and (iii) uncertain financial sustainability. These risks and mitigating measures are \ndiscussed in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan.28 The integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n41.  The government and Bangladesh Railway have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n42.  The government and Bangladesh Railway have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by \nthe government and Bangladesh Railway with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are \nset forth in the loan agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazar Railway Project, Phase 1 in \nan  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000,000,  which \ncomprises \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and \nother  terms  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources; and \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and \nother terms to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n5 September 2016 \n                                                \n26 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Indigenous People\u2019s Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nEfficient and safe railway transport in Bangladesh (7th Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020)a \nImproved subregional connectivity and trade (7th Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2024     \nRailway transport  a. 10 passenger trains  a.
