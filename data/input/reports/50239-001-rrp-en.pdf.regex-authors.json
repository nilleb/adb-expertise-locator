I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to \u20ac45,000,000 in CreditAccess Asia (CAA) to provide growth capital to support \nCAA\u2019s pan-Asia microfinance operations.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Microfinance  subsector  overview:  India.  As  of  31  March  2016,  the  microfinance \nsubsector in India provided microcredit to 33.2 million customers through 9,781 branches across \nthe country, disbursing 34.7 million loans amounting to Rs670 billion (average loan size of $265).2 \nDisbursements in FY2016 grew 78.2% over FY2015, while the aggregate gross loan portfolio \ngrowth increased 91.0% during the same period. Since FY2013, there has been a compound \nannual growth rate of 88.6% in disbursements and 93.7% in the gross loan portfolio in the sector.3 \nDue to continuing demand and large underserved segments, CRISIL, a rating agency, expects \nthe aggregate microfinance institution (MFI) loan portfolio to grow 30%\u201334% annually from \nFY2016 to FY2020. Problem loans among MFIs have been steadily decreasing, falling from \n0.50% in FY2013 to 0.33% in FY2016 for 30 days past due. However, high growth rates, partly \ndriven by an increase in client leverage in the top 10 states for microfinance lending, might put \npressure on portfolio quality by 2020.4 \n \n3.  Microfinance subsector overview: Indonesia. Commercial banks dominate Indonesia\u2019s \nfinancial system, have wide access across various areas of the country, and account for 98% of \nthe system\u2019s loans. As banking regulations require customers to have proof of a permanent job, \nincome, and physical collateral, a significant portion of microfinance demand is met by a large \nnumber  of  nonbank  financial  institutions,  including  rural  banks,  regional  cooperatives, \nmultifinance companies, and venture capital companies.5 Consequently, few large-scale MFIs \nhave national coverage. Large nationwide institutions that cater to individuals earning $2\u2013$6 per \nday are (i) BTPN Syariah, a commercial bank that uses the joint liability group (JLG) methodology \nto serve around 2 million clients; and (ii) Mitra Bisnis Keluarga Ventura, a venture capital company \nand the largest JLG lending nonbank MFI in Java, with a client base of almost 600,000.6 \n \n4.  Microfinance subsector overview: Philippines. According to the Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas (BSP), banks are a source of borrowing for only 4.4% of the Philippine population, while \nfinancing companies lend to 12.0% of the population, cooperatives to 10.5%, microfinance \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to 9.9%, and government entities to 6.1%. NGOs typically \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will make an initial investment of up to \u20ac30 million in CAA.  \n2  The information pertains to nonbanking financial company MFIs, which constitute over 90% of the microfinance \nsubsector\u2019s total business in India on aggregate. The data excludes Bandhan, which was the largest MFI in the \ncountry and converted to a full-fledged bank in August 2015. \n3  Microfinance Institutions Network. 2016.

They can also be an insurance agent.  \n6  A JLG is a group, typically of 4\u201310 people from the same village, who come together to take out loans without \nproviding any collateral. Each member of the group is jointly and severally liable for the repayment of loans taken by \nall group members. \n \n ", "2    \n \nserve the portion of the population with the lowest income and hold a total portfolio of P11.6 billion \nwith about 2.5 million borrowers (up from P2.6 billion in 2002).7 Since 2000, the BSP has been \nimproving the National Framework for Microfinance Regulation, which was rated third best in the \nworld (at the same level as India) by the Economist Intelligence Unit.8 The strong regulatory \nenvironment has led to an approved national strategy for financial inclusion, which further \npromotes access to finance and financial stability. \n \n5.  Gender and microfinance. Women are one of the most vulnerable groups in the world\u2019s \npoorest populations, and a significant number of them remain unbanked. According to the World \nBank\u2019s financial inclusion data, in 2014 women lagged behind men in terms of borrowing from \nformal financial institutions in India, with 7.8% of men and only 4.9% of women accessing credit. \nIn Indonesia, 15.1% of men and 11.2% of women had access to credit. In the Philippines, while \nmore  women  were  able  to  borrow  from  financial  institutions  than  men  (13.6%  for  women \ncompared to 9.9% for men), the unbanked female population remains significant.9 Businesses \nowned by women remain unevenly constrained by a lack of access to credit. Constraints include \nlack of a land title, lack of collateral needed to obtain credit, low income, lack of financial \ndocuments, and unfamiliarity with paperwork and procedures.10 Nonbank microfinance models \nhave provided an alternative channel for provision of financial services to women because they \naddress the constraints of traditional banking models by, for example, having limited or no \ncollateral requirements.11 Well-designed microfinance products provide an opportunity for women \nto enter the formal finance sector, build microfinance credit histories, and increase economic \nactivities. \n \n6.  Rationale.  Access  to finance  is  a key  challenge  in  Asia,  with  estimated  unbanked \npopulations of 46% in South Asia and 69% in East Asia and the Pacific. Access to credit is even \nmore limited in these regions, with less than 14% of borrowers accessing credit through formal \nchannels in South Asia and 27% in East Asia and the Pacific (footnote 9). Given the continued \nneed to address access to credit for many customer segments across developing Asia, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  sought  to  identify  partner  financial  institutions  that  have \ndemonstrated the ability to reach underbanked segments profitably and sustainably. Through a \nmicrofinance holding company model, ADB will support financial inclusion across several markets \nwhere access to finance is severely restricted. ADB will be able to do so without taking direct \nexposure on higher risk early-stage entities in these markets and will benefit from the larger and \nmore profitable Indian operation, Grameen Koota, which is the largest asset on CAA\u2019s balance \nsheet, thus lowering ADB\u2019s portfolio unsystematic risk. This allows for greater development impact \nwith greater risk diversification, as failure of any one of the new subsidiaries will not significantly \nimpact the overall operations of CAA, thus also protecting ADB\u2019s interests. The investment also \nallows greater diversification of ADB\u2019s microfinance exposure by geography and currency. The \nholding company model also allows the newer operating subsidiaries to draw on the experience \nof the established subsidiaries, while simultaneously offering more agility to innovate and pilot \ninitiatives that can be later adopted by larger MFI subsidiaries. Holding companies add value to \ntheir subsidiaries by providing stronger branding and support to the operating MFIs in areas such \n                                                \n7  BSP. 2015.

Microfinance holding company models have been successfully tested in other instances. \nADB has worked with AccessHolding as a lender to AccessBank Azerbaijan, and has also worked \nwith FINCA International, which operates under a similar model with 23 operating subsidiaries. \nCAA\u2019s track record of supporting highly successful MFIs, such as Grameen Koota and Equitas \nHoldings, and commitment to expanding the model to other markets in Southeast Asia with a \nstrong focus on women make it an excellent partner for ADB. ADB will support CAA\u2019s expansion \nof  its  operating  subsidiaries  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  while  reinforcing  the \nnetwork\u2019s governance, technology, and innovative product development. The role of ADB as \nCAA\u2019s first development financial institution investor is also expected to attract further funding, \nwhich will be channeled to Asian microfinance markets. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  Business overview. CAA, a holding company headquartered in Amsterdam, operates \nMFIs across Asia, serving approximately 1.8 million clients (99.8% of whom are women) with JLG \nloans (loan sizes of \u20ac200\u2013\u20ac500), individual loans (\u20ac500\u2013\u20ac2,000), and other financial services \nsuch as life and health insurance. CAA started operations in 2006 under the leadership of Paolo \nBrichetti and a group of Italian investors. At the start of its operations, CAA took minority stakes \nin MFIs and was an early-stage investor in Grameen Koota and Equitas Holdings in India. In 2011, \nthe company changed its strategy to an operator model and started new MFIs in Indonesia (Bina \nArtha Ventura) and the Philippines (One Puhunan), while acquiring a majority stake in Grameen \nKoota.12 As of August 2016, the CAA Group had a loan portfolio of about \u20ac440 million distributed \nacross 692 branches in three countries, and employed 7,325 people worldwide. CAA also holds \na 5.21% stake in Equitas Holdings, India\u2019s fourth-largest MFI. \n \n8.  The operating subsidiaries. With an income-generation capacity of over \u20ac1 million in net \nprofits monthly, Grameen Koota is the backbone of the CAA Group. It started operations in 1999 \nas a nonbank financial company (NBFC) in India. As of August 2016, it had a loan portfolio of \n\u20ac409 million with over 1.5 million women customers in 390 branches spread across 74 districts in \nfive states (Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu) and 4,610 \nstaff members. Grameen Koota was awarded MFI of the Year in the Large MFI category in the \nMicrofinance India 2015 Awards. Grameen Koota has been part of ADB\u2019s Microfinance Risk \nParticipation Program since 2012. Bina Artha started operations as a venture capital company in \nDecember 2011. As of August 2016, it had a loan portfolio of \u20ac20.4 million with 195,353 clients \nserved by 192 branches and 1,715 staff members. One Puhunan started operations in February \n2014. As of August 2016, it had a loan portfolio of \u20ac10.7 million with 109,225 clients served by \n110 branches and 1,000 staff members. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n9.  ADB funding consists of up to \u20ac45 million in equity investment in CAA, with an initial \ninvestment of up to \u20ac30 million. Depending on the total equity raised by CAA in the current capital-\nraising round, ADB\u2019s final stake in CAA is estimated to be 9%. CAA will use ADB\u2019s proceeds to \ncapitalize the existing subsidiaries and support their growth. Under separate approval, ADB will \n                                                \n12 CAA is also starting operations in Viet Nam, where it commenced a pilot in November 2016 and expects to start full-\nfledged operations by the end of April 2017. \n \n ", "4    \n \nprovide capacity building technical assistance of up to $500,000, which will accompany ADB \nfunding and will support CAA\u2019s institutional strengthening with initiatives such as the roll out of \nstrategic information technology projects, including data mining and cashless processes.13 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.14 CAA will provide ADB with financial \nreports at predetermined regular intervals and on demand (both at a consolidated and subsidiary \nlevel),  including  (i)  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  (ii)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, (iii) reports on CAA\u2019s loan portfolio characteristics, (iv) annual reports on selected \ndevelopment indicators agreed between ADB and CAA, and (v) annual reports on safeguards \nand social protection compliance. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n11.  Supporting  finance  sector  development  and  financial  inclusion.  The  proposed \ntransaction seeks to support a private financial institution\u2019s growth as it expands its operations \nacross some of Asia\u2019s most significantly underserved markets where financial outreach is lowest. \nWhile CAA has been able to access other sources of funding, ADB will provide a high quality \nstable source of capital with a long term vision aligned with CAA\u2019s goal to contribute to closing \nthe financial gap currently unmet by mainstream financial institutions and investors. \n \n12.  Support  inclusive  growth  as  a  strategic  shareholder.  ADB  will  be  CAA\u2019s  first \nmultilateral institutional partner. CAA specifically approached ADB because (i) CAA\u2019s areas of \noperations align with ADB\u2019s regional focus, and (ii) a partnership with ADB can help facilitate \ndialogue with governments to foster a more conducive environment for microfinance. Through \nADB\u2019s nominee director on CAA\u2019s board and broader shareholder engagement, CAA hopes to \nbenefit from ADB\u2019s experience with other financial institutions in the region.15 Having ADB as a \nstrategic shareholder will send a positive signal to potential new investors. \n \n13.  Strengthening capital adequacy of CreditAccess Asia\u2019s subsidiaries. CAA will need \nto further capitalize its subsidiaries to support their growth as they expand in response to the \nsignificant demand for credit from their targeted underserved and unserved segments and the \nneeds of their clients. The proceeds from ADB\u2019s investment will have a multiplier effect. Following \nADB\u2019s investment, CAA plans to infuse capital in its operations in India, Indonesia, and Viet \nNam.16 \n \n14.  Gender equity theme. The World Bank\u2019s Global Findex reveals that women lag behind \nmen in financial access, with a gap between men and women of 4% in East Asia and 18% in \nSouth Asia.17 According to a Goldman Sachs study, if the credit gap is closed by 2020 in Brazil, \nRussia, India, and the People\u2019s Republic of China plus the Next Eleven countries (including \nIndonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam), per capita incomes could be 12% higher on average \n                                                \n13 The technical assistance will be approved separately and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB will only be entitled to nominate a director for so long as it retains a shareholding above a certain threshold. \n16 Assuming a target capital adequacy ratio of 20%, ADB\u2019s initial investment is expected to support disbursements of \n\u20ac150 million in these jurisdictions. \n17 WB. Global Findex Data: Gender. http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/indv-characteristics/ \ngender (accessed 18 November 2016). \n \n ", "5 \n \nby 2030.18 CAA\u2019s subsidiaries target primarily women with services adapted to their needs, \nincluding loans for income-generation purposes, sanitation, health, and education. ADB has \nprovided expert advice in the preparation of a gender action plan to help CAA become more \neffective in serving women clients\u2019 needs. CAA\u2019s institutional capacity on this domain will be \nfurther reinforced with ADB\u2019s technical assistance.  The project is expected to benefit at least 3.5 \nmillion women borrowers directly by 2021 and is classified as a gender equity project.19  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact. The impact will be strengthening the capacity of domestic financial institutions to \nencourage and expand access to banking, insurance, and financial services for the underbanked \nand unbanked population. \n \n16.  Outcome. ADB\u2019s equity investment will allow increased uptake of financial services by \nwomen to narrow the gender gap in financial inclusion. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) the increase in CAA\u2019s capacity to provide loans \nand other financial services to micro entrepreneurs and micro businesses by investing up to \u20ac45 \nmillion in MFIs, (ii) the introduction of a new financial product, and (iii) the expansion of CAA\u2019s \nbusiness into new markets. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for the finance sector.20 \nThe proposed investment contributes to finance sector development by supporting the growth of \nan institution that is dedicated to delivering access to finance to the significantly unserved and \nunderserved population in Asia. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 also seeks to promote \ninclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, people with lower income or in \nunderserved segments will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. The proposed \nequity investment will support microfinance in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \nMicrofinance is one of the financial infrastructures identified as a high priority for the governments \nof the target countries. The investment also aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for \nIndia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam; and with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.21 \n \n                                                \n18 The Next Eleven countries, according to Goldman Sachs, are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Republic of Korea, \nMexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey, and Viet Nam.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n19.  The  investment  is  classified  category  FI  treated  as  category  C  for  impacts  on  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts of the proposed investments and associated risks of CAA and its subsidiaries\u2019 \nbusiness activities have been assessed, and there are expected to be minimal or no adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples are \nunlikely. The lending portfolio of CAA\u2019s operating subsidiaries comprises small loans of $200\u2013\n$2,000  to  JLGs  and  individual  micro  entrepreneurs.  Projects  classified  category A  for  the \nenvironment and category A or category B for involuntary settlement or indigenous peoples will \nbe excluded from its portfolio. CAA and its subsidiaries will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list, ensure that its lending activities abide by applicable national laws and regulations, \nand comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). CAA and its subsidiaries will confirm \nthis in their periodic report to ADB.22 They will comply with national labor laws and will take \nmeasures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards. CAA will collect the \nreports of its operating subsidiaries and submit a consolidated report regularly to ADB on its \ncompliance with such laws, and the measures taken. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n20.  CAA was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. CAA\u2019s draft know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money-laundering policy, which is subject to board approval, mitigates the risks \nof  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment \ndocumentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n21.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and \nsingle investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n22.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),23 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the governments of \nIndonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have no objection to the proposed investment in CAA. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.
