This is the first step in creating the Southern Gas Corridor as an \nalternative  for  gas  deliveries  to  Europe  from  the  Caspian  region  and  the  Middle  East.  The \nproject supports regional cooperation and integration, a core operational area in Strategy 2020 \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), 4  and  will  improve  Europe\u2019s  energy  security  by \ndiversifying  its  gas  sources.  Sustained  revenues  from  gas  exports  will  fund  social  and \ninfrastructure  spending  to  help  diversify  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  away  from  its  dependency  on \nhydrocarbons. The project will create over 19,000 temporary and 1,800 permanent local jobs.  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nEconomy and energy sector. Azerbaijan has extensive energy resources, with proven \noil reserves in excess of 7 billion barrels and over 1,100 bcm of natural gas reserves. In 2015, it \nproduced  841,000  barrels  of  oil  and  18.2  bcm  of  gas. 5  Since  1994,  the  government  has \nsuccessfully  pursued  a  strategy  of  developing  the  oil  and  gas  sector  as  the  country\u2019s  primary \nsource  of  economic  growth.  It  has  been  operated  in  line  with  international  best  practices  and \nunder a predictable contractual framework, attracting strong private sector participation with an \nestimated $60 billion in foreign direct investment in the country during 1994\u22122014.6 In 2014, the \nenergy sector employed about 1.4% of Azerbaijan\u2019s officially reported workforce of 4.6 million. \n\n4. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s rapid transition to an upper middle-income country has been made possible \nby the exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources, high levels of public expenditure, and market-\nbased  economic  reforms.7 The  associated  high  growth  rates  since  2001  have  resulted  in  a \nsignificant drop in the percentage of  the population living below the national poverty line: from \n49%  in  2001  to  5%  in  2013.  The  oil  and  gas  industry  has  played  an  important  role  in  poverty \nreduction,  with  hydrocarbons  contributing  approximately  31%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct and approximately 87% of the country\u2019s total gross exports in 2015.8  \n\n5. \nAzerbaijan  has  an  extensive  gas  network,  and  is  a  net  exporter  of  oil,  gas,  and \nelectricity.  Through  the  State  Program  on  Socioeconomic  Development  of  Baku  City  and  its \n\n                                                \n1   The  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a \nnonsovereign  loan  to  Lukoil  Overseas  Shah  Deniz  to  finance  its  stake  in  the  project  in  2015  and  is  proposing  a \nsimilar $500 million loan to SGC for the same project.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n3   The  project  finances  the  Shah  Deniz  Stage  II  expansion  of  the  gas  field  and  production  facilities  and  additional \ncapital expenditure requirements and operational expenditure outlays related to the Shah Deniz Stage I project. \n4  ADB. 2008.

London. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSettlements, Azerbaijan\u2019s gasification rate increased from 78.5% in 2013 to 86.7% in 2015; the \ngovernment  plans  to reach  90%  national gasification  by  2018. The  power  sector  is the  largest \ngas  consumer.  Over  90%  of  power  is  generated  using  gas,  and  power  generation  consumes \nabout  half  of  the  9.8  bcm  of  gas  consumed  annually.  The  electrification  rate  is  100%.  Gas  is \ncurrently exported to Iran, Georgia, and Turkey. Diversification of the export base by accessing \nlarger  markets  is  needed  to  secure  stable  revenues  from  gas  production.  Economic \ndiversification to reduce reliance on the hydrocarbon sector has been a significant challenge.  \n\nProject. The Shah Deniz gas condensate field is located about 70 kilometers offshore, \n6. \nsoutheast  of  Baku,  Azerbaijan.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  gas  fields  in  the world,  with  over  1,000 \nbcm  of  gas.9 The  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  development  is  a  public\u2013private  partnership  between \nAzerbaijan  and five international  companies,  led by  BP  (through  its  subsidiary,  BP  Exploration \n[Azerbaijan]) as the operator. Shah Deniz gas will be exported to Europe, via Georgia, Turkey, \nGreece,  and  Albania  (the  Southern  Gas  Corridor).10 Exploration,  development,  and  production \nare governed by the Shah Deniz production sharing agreement (PSA), which was executed in \n1996.11 BP is responsible for the development and operation of the gas field and the laying and \noperation  of  the  South  Caucasus  Pipeline  Expansion.  All  other  Shah  Deniz  PSA  partners  are \nacting purely as financial investors, and not involved in day-to-day operations.12   \n\n7. \n The  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  is  being  developed  in  two  stages.  The  initial  development, \nShah  Deniz  Stage  I  (Shah  Deniz-l)  began  production  in  2006.  Despite  the  use  of  pioneering \ntechnologies,  it  was  developed  in  only  7  years  and  has  become  a  reliable  gas  supplier  to \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Full gas field development under Shah Deniz Stage II (Shah \nDeniz-II)  is  underway,  with  about  93%  of  procurement  and  72%  of  construction  completed. \nCompletion  of  full  field  development  of  the  Shah  Deniz  is  on  target,  with  gas  scheduled  to  be \nsupplied  to  Georgia  and  Turkey  in  late  2018,  and  to  Europe  in  2020.  Once  completed,  Shah \nDeniz-II  will  produce  16 bcm  of gas  per  annum, in addition  to the  9.8  bcm from  Shah Deniz-l. \nDaily production of gas condensate will increase from 45,000 barrels to 105,000 barrels.  \n\n8. \nThe  State  Oil  Company  of  Azerbaijan  Republic  (SOCAR),  a  vertically  integrated  state-\nowned  oil  and  gas  company,  is  responsible  for  the  exploration,  exploitation,  and  marketing  of \npetroleum  and  petrochemical  products  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  The  State  Oil \nFund  of  the  Republic  of Azerbaijan  (SOFAZ)  was established in 1999  to  convert  the  country\u2019s \nhydrocarbon reserves into financial assets that generate perpetual income.  \n\n9. \nTo ensure the success of the fully developed Shah Deniz gas field and gas delivery to \nEurope,  in  October  2013  the  President  of  Azerbaijan  signed  a  decree  establishing  a  State \nCommission. 13  A  subsequent  presidential  decree  in  February  2014  established  SGC  to \nconsolidate  the  financing  and management  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  ownership  interests  in  Shah  Deniz \nand  the  transmission  of  gas  to  Europe. 14  SGC,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  SGC \nUpstream  (SGCU),  acquired  a  6.67%  interest  in  Shah  Deniz  and  contracted  to  purchase  an \n\n                                                \n9   BP. Shah Deniz Stage I Project. http://www.bp.com/en_az/caspian/operationsprojects/Shahdeniz/SDstage1.html. \n10  The  Southern  Gas  Corridor  comprises  (i)  the  South  Caucasus  Pipeline and  South  Caucasus  Pipeline  Expansion  \nfrom  the  Sangachal  Terminal  in  Azerbaijan  through  Georgia  to  Turkey;  (ii)  the  Trans-Anatolian  Pipeline  through \nTurkey  and  Greece;  and  (iii)  the  Trans-Adriatic  Pipeline  through  Albania  and  the  Adriatic  Sea  to  southern  Italy. \nLong-term gas offtake agreements are in place. \n\n11  While currently in effect until 2036, the Shah Deniz PSA may be extended until 2048.   \n12  Current  Shah  Deniz  PSA  partners  are  BP  (28.83%),  Turkish  Petroleum  Overseas  (19.00%),  Petronas  (15.50%), \n\nNaftiran Intertrade (10.00%), Lukoil (10.00%), SOCAR (10.00%), and SGC (6.67%).  \n\n13 The State Commission was established by the Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan  to oversee the \n\ntransportation of Azeri natural gas to world markets along the Southern Gas Corridor, dated 29 October 2013. \n14  SGC is 51% owned by the Republic of Azerbaijan, represented by the Ministry of Economy, and 49% by SOCAR. \n\n\fadditional  10%  interest  (the  completion  of  which  is  expected  to  take  place  in  2023),  from \nSOCAR\u2019s  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Azerbaijan  (Shah  Deniz)  Limited  (AzSD).15 SGC\u2019s  indirect \nstake  in  BP\u2019s  cash  call  contributions  and  its  concurrent  investments  in  the  Southern  Gas \nCorridor  to  date  have  been  financed  by  (i)  approximately  $1.7  billion  in  equity  from  its \nshareholders, (ii) $2.5 billion in 10-year SGC bonds subscribed by SOFAZ, (iii) $1.0 billion in 10-\nyear  Eurobonds  issued  in  March  2016,  and  (iv)  revenues  generated  by  the  Shah  Deniz-I  and \nSouth Caucasus Pipeline projects.   \n\nThe 10% interest held by AzSD will be transferred to SGCU upon completion of closing \n10. \nconditions,  which  include  the  full  and  unconditional  repayment  in  2023  of  certain  outstanding \nbonds issued by SOCAR. The deferred sales and purchase agreement provides that SGCU will \nmake  progress  payments  for  the  cash  call  requirements  of  the  10%  interest,  and  AzSD  will \ncontinue to meet all expenditures, receive all income, and perform all obligations relating to the \n10% interest.16  Pursuant to the Resolution of the State Commission of July 2014,17 all revenues \nreceived by SOCAR from this 10% interest are to be used to support SGC\u2019s financing needs. \n\n11. \n\n Financing need. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n12. \nLow  hydrocarbon  prices  and  consequential  unfavorable  financial  market  conditions \nresulted in the government requesting multilateral financing institutions to help finance the Shah \nDeniz-II  and  the  pipeline  projects,  totaling  $51  billion  in  aggregate  investments  by  2020.  ADB \nhas been requested to consider financing SGC\u2019s cash calls for Shah Deniz-II. To help overcome \nadverse market conditions, it is proposed for ADB to (i) issue a PCG covering up to $500 million \nin principal payments plus interest and guarantee fees against the non-honoring of a Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  guarantee  to  commercial  banks  for  SGC\u2019s  borrowing,  and  (ii)  provide  a \nnonsovereign  loan  of  up  to  $500  million.18 The  government  may  request  further  support  from \nADB for 2018\u22122020 cash calls should financing costs through the financial markets remain high. \n\nDevelopment  impact. Globally depressed oil prices and the halving of the value of the \n13. \nAzerbaijan manat against the United States dollar in 2015 have placed pressure on Azerbaijan\u2019s \neconomic growth and balance of payments. As a result, government revenues and the country\u2019s \nforeign exchange reserves have decreased significantly. The downgrading of Azerbaijan\u2019s credit \nrating  in  early  2016  increased  Azerbaijan\u2019s  financing  costs  and  adversely  affected  access  to \ncommercial funds. SOFAZ was responsible for 50.8% of the national budget in 2014 and 46.5% \nin 2015.19 Low oil and gas prices, however, have decreased SOFAZ\u2019s net holdings. \n\nADB assistance to SGC to meet financial commitments to Shah Deniz will allow SOFAZ \n14. \nand the government to use oil and gas revenues for social expenditures and continued efforts to \ndiversify the economy away from the oil and gas sector. Based on a diagnostic analysis of the \neconomy, the government has identified priority sectors20 to help achieve such diversification as \nspecified  in  a  2016  presidential  order,  providing  basic  directions  to  develop  a  new \n\n                                                \n15 SGC\u2019s initial 6.67% interest was purchased from SOCAR in 2014, which SOCAR purchased from Statoil in 2013. \n16 Finalization of project documentation, including the PCG, will be subject to satisfactory legal due diligence on AzSD \nbeing completed and appropriate contractual provisions applicable to AzSD being agreed with AzSD and SGC. \n17 Resolution of the State Commission on determination of the financing mechanism of the Projects by Southern Gas \nCorridor  CJSC  (SGC)  in  order  to  ensure  the  operation  of  the  Southern  Gas  Corridor  in  connection  with  the \ntransportation of Azerbaijani Gas to world markets. 9 July 2014. \n\n18 ADB. Forthcoming. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \n\nSouthern Gas Corridor CJSC for the Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project in Azerbaijan. Manila. \n\n19  Government of Azerbaijan, Ministry of Finance. 2015. The Law on State Budget 2015. Baku. \n20 These sectors include agriculture, manufacturing, logistics, tourism, and education (vocational training).  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fcomprehensive  national  economic  vision.21 These  sectors  are  relatively  more  labor  intensive \nand  their  further  development  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  employment,  and \nparticularly  demand  for  skilled  jobs.  The  government\u2019s  focus  on  vocational  training  is  also \nexpected to accommodate such increase in demand for skilled jobs.   \n\n15. \nAdded value of the partial credit guarantee. The use of the PCG is essential for SGC \nto  continue  meeting  its  financial  obligations  toward  the  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  expansion  and \npipeline  projects  through  private  sector  participation,  despite  the  current  unfavorable  market \nconditions. Without ADB\u2019s credit enhancement, SGC\u2019s ability to meet its participation obligations \nwith  funding  from  commercial  lenders  is  likely  to  be  prohibitively  expensive.  Although  ADB\u2019s \nPCG will help lower SGC\u2019s cost of financing, it reflects commercially feasible risk-based pricing \nfor an export revenue-generating project, while sharing underlying project and commercial risks \nwith  commercial  lenders  for  the  uncovered  portion.  In  contrast  to  making  a  direct  loan,  the \nproposed PCG instrument allows ADB to leverage the use of its own capital resources.   \n\n16. \nADB  support.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  government  efforts  to  improve  the  sector  include \ninterventions  in  energy  efficiency,  power  sector  financial  sustainability,  renewable  energy,  and \nprivate  sector  participation.22 The  government  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  addressing  sector \nissues  through  the  2016  presidential  order  (footnote  21),  and  the  draft  State  Program  on \nEfficient  Use  of  Energy  Resources  and  Energy  Efficiency  of  End  Customers  (2016\u22122020), \nwhich calls for tariff reforms to recover costs and achieve commercially viable operations.23   \n\n17. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 (footnote 7) has a focus on energy. The \nproject  aligns  with  the  commitment  by  ADB  to  provide  catalytic  solutions  for  upper  middle-\nincome countries like Azerbaijan under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.24 It supports two \nStrategy  2020  core  operation  areas  (infrastructure  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration) \nand one strategic driver of change (catalyzing investments through private sector participation).  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  aligned  with  sustained  revenues  from  oil  and  gas  exports, \nwhich  will  facilitate  diversification  of  the  country\u2019s  economy.25 The  outcome  will  be  increased \nproduction  and  exports  of  gas  from  the  Shah  Deniz  gas  field.  The  project  will  help  diversify \nEurope\u2019s energy sources and contribute to the development of multi-seller, multi-buyer markets. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n19. \nThe project\u2019s outputs are (i) Shah Deniz-II natural gas production and processing facility \nunder  construction,  (ii)  greater  efficiency  in  the  gas  sector,  and  (iii)  jobs  created  during \nconstruction and operations. The ADB PCG will  help SGC secure financing, and proceed with \nthe (i) construction of two new bridge-linked oil platforms, (ii) drilling of 26 new subsea wells, (iii) \nconstruction  of  a  new  500\u2013kilometer  subsea  pipelines,  (iv)  consolidation  of  the  government\u2019s \ninterests  in  Shah  Deniz  within  a  single  entity,  and  (v)  creation  of  over  19,000  temporary  and \n\n                                                \n21  Government of Azerbaijan. 2016.

Estimates for Shah Deniz-II of the gas-\ninitially-in-place show that there will be sufficient resources to deliver the annual gas production \nof 16 bcm. The technical advisor concurred with BP\u2019s detailed drilling plans, which employ state-\nof-the-art drilling methods and technology. BP has a well-established capital value management \nprocess  and  the  latest  progress  report  shows  Shah  Deniz-ll  is  not  only  well  underway,  but \nahead of schedule and 5% under budget. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].  \n\n25. \n \n26.  While  these  analyses  show  the  project\u2019s  financial  and  economic  viability,  SGC  faces  a \nchallenge  in  raising  commercial  financing  to  meet  its  sizable  upcoming  financing  needs. \nHowever,  any  shortfall  will  be  covered  by  additional  contributions  from  SGC  shareholders  in \naccordance  with  a  State  Commission  resolution  (footnote  17),  providing  an  established \nmitigation mechanism to the potential challenge.   \n\n                                                \n32  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  Report of lenders\u2019 technical advisor for Azerbaijan: Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project (July 2016).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAs  a  key  source  of  funds  for  SGC,  SOFAZ\u2019s  financial  strength  was  also  analyzed.  Its \n27. \nassets  have  grown  rapidly  from  $2.5  billion  in  early  2008  to  $35.1  billion  as  of  mid-2016. \nHowever, the 2015 drop in oil and gas prices adversely impacted SOFAZ\u2019s revenues and asset \nbase.  As  of  the  end  of  2015,  the  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  had  contributed  $2.4  billion  to  SOFAZ \nsince the commissioning of Shah Deniz-I in 2007. Based on the oil and gas price forecast by the \nlenders\u2019  market  consultant,  Shah  Deniz  is  expected  to  contribute  an  additional  $10  billion  to \nSOFAZ by 2035. While SOFAZ provides security to SGC, implementation of Shah Deniz-II and \nthe pipelines will further strengthen the financial sustainability of SOFAZ. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n28. \n SGC\u2019s financial management risk is considered moderate. While it has a sound financial \nmanagement system and structure, securing large financing in a timely manner will continue to \nbe  a  challenge.  Lack  of  experience  with  multilateral  financing  institutions  while  relying \nsubstantially  on  such financing  is  also  a  challenge.  SGC  has  put forth mitigation measures  by \nengaging legal and financial advisors and through the early engagement of multilateral financial \ninstitutions.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and SGC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 32). \n \nProject  procurement  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  BP\u2019s  procurement  practices  as \n29. \nagreed  among  the  parties  to  the  joint  operating  agreement.34 The  lenders\u2019  technical  advisor \nconfirmed  that  BP  Azerbaijan\u2019s  procurement  strategy  and  supply  chain  management  are  well \nestablished.  With  approximately  93%  procured  and  72%  completed,  the  project  is  ahead  of \nschedule and actual  costs  are  5%  under  budget.  The first gas  is  scheduled  to be  delivered in \n2018.  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  project\u2019s  procurement  has  been  conducted  following  normal \ncommercial practices, with due attention to economy and efficiency as required for procurement \nin relation to loans guaranteed by ADB. \n\n \n30. \nIntegrity  due diligence was  conducted  by  ADB's Private  Sector Operations  Department \n(PSOD) for its proposed nonsovereign loan (footnote 1). For this PCG proposal, the Central and \nWest  Asia  Regional  Department  has  relied  on  the  outcome  of  PSOD\u2019s  integrity  due  diligence. \nNo  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  issues  were  identified  in  relation  to  SGC. \nAzerbaijan is an early member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initative (EITI) and was \ngiven compliant status in 2009. The EITI redefined its standards in 2013 and now includes more \ncomprehensive  requirements  for  civil  society  engagement.  Against  these  new  standards, \nAzerbaijan  was  downgraded  to  candidate  status  in  2015.  During  its  recent  October  2016 \nmeetings,  EITI\u2019s  board  concluded  that  Azerbaijan  has  made  meaningful  progress  with \nconsiderable  improvements,  maintaining  the  country\u2019s  candidate  status.  The  government  is \nexpected to continue implementing corrective actions to regain \u201ccompliant\u2019 status in 2017. \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nD. \n\n31. \nThe project will provide additional economic benefits and support government policies by \n(i)  providing  revenues  for  the  development  of  other  sectors,  (ii)  modernizing  the  oil  and  gas \nsector, (iii) promoting the efficient use of energy resources, and (iv) increasing sector efficiency. \nThe  community  engagement  and  workforce  management  plans  of  BP  recognize  key  social \nissues for communities in the vicinity of the gas terminal. Specific recruitment targets for named \n\n                                                \n34 Shah Deniz Joint Operating Agreement dated 5 March 1997. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \nSafeguards  \n\nE. \n\ncommunities  are  included  in  construction  contracts.  Over  20,000  people  were  involved  in \nconstruction activities in Azerbaijan by the end of 2015; 80% were Azerbaijani nationals.  \n\n32. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project  is \nclassified  category  A  for  environment,  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. Potential environmental and social impacts of the project were identified and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in \nsafeguard reports and plans. An environmental and social impacts assessment was performed \nfor  Shah  Deniz-II  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  July  2014.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS \nrequirements  for  financing  of  existing  facilities,  an  environmental  and  social  compliance  audit \nreport (ESCAR) for the existing facilities of Shah Deniz-I was carried out in May 2014. Another \nESCAR  on  the  ongoing  Shah  Deniz-II  construction  activities  was  produced  in  July  2015  and \nupdated in August 2016.35 The audit found the project in compliance with the ADB SPS, with no \ncorrective action plan required. SGC\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to ensure that BP \nproperly manages the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n33. \nThe  project  is  located  in  Sangachal  Bay  in  the  Caspian  Sea,  which  contains  high \nbiodiversity areas; the environment and social impact assessment indicates the project area is \nnot  located  in  areas  of  high  biodiversity.  The  Shah  Deniz-ll  contract  area  overlaps  with  the \nmigration  routes  and  spawning  areas  of  some  fish  species.  The  impact  assessment  indicates \nthat  construction  impacts  on  fish  will  be  minimal.  Fishing  is  the  dominant  threat  to  fish \npopulations  in  the  Caspian  Sea.  Existing  fish  population  monitoring  programs  established  for \nShah Deniz-I are satisfactory to ADB and will continue. The  Shah Deniz area may have some \noverlap  with  Caspian  seal  migration  pathways.  BP  engages  with  and  provides  support  to  the \nCaspian  Sea  conservation  programs.  BP  has  in  place  an  ecological  and  wildlife  management \nplan. ADB will require a commercial loan provision that SGC, to the extent permissible under the \nproject  agreements,  procure  that  the  operator  implements  the  project  in  compliance  with  the \nrelevant plans and ADB\u2019s SPS requirements. \n \n34. \nUnder the terms of the Shah Deniz PSA, SOCAR has transferred all lands required for \nthe  Shah  Deniz-II  project  to  the  operator.  The  audit  confirmed  that  no  resettlement  issues, \nincluding  access  rights  or  temporary  usage  of  lands,  existed  as  a  result  of  the  Shah  Deniz-I \nfacilities  and  the  sites  proposed  for  expansion  of  the  terminal  as  part  of  Shah  Deniz-II.  No \nindigenous communities are located in the project area, and no indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts are \nexpected.  The  operator  has  prepared  and  implemented  a  small-scale  fishing  livelihood \nmanagement  plan  to  address  economic  displacement  of  48  fishermen.  All  affected  fishermen \nhave  resumed  their  fishing  activities  at  the  same  location,  except  for  six  fishermen,  who \nvoluntarily  chose  to  move  to  another  location  about  40  kilometers  from  the  Sangachal  Bay. \nThese fishermen have reported additional impacts due to increased transportation costs and the \nlower  productivity  at  the  new  fishing  location.  The  operator  is  trying  to  address  these \nunanticipated  impacts  in  consultation  with  the  affected  fishermen.  The  operator  will  monitor \nimplementation of the fishing livelihood management plan and prepare a closure report once all \nresidual  grievances  are  satisfactorily  addressed.  Through  ADB-required  commercial  loan \nprovisions, SGC will be required to procure to the extent possible under its project powers that \nthe  operator  complies  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \n\n                                                \n35 Earlier  drafts  of  the  ESCAR  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  beginning  in  mid-2015;  the  final  ESCAR  was \n\ndisclosed on 28 September 2016. \n\n \n\n\fStrategy,  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.36 \nSimilarly,  SGC  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  the  compliance  of  the  operator  (and  its \ncontractors)  with  such  laws.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are \nexpected to be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.37 Such reports will be similar \nin scope and contents to the ESCAR. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 38  The  project\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nPipelines are not completed as planned.  Project progress is based on BP\u2019s extensive experience and expertise, and \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nDiversion of Shah Deniz revenues or \nlack of sufficient financing in a timely \nmanner leads to SGC\u2019s noncompliance \nwith Shah Deniz agreements. \nInadequate gas and gas condensate \nsales revenues due to the persistence \nof low oil and gas prices or a drop in \ndemand or take-off. \nConstruction activities fail to meet the \nnational environmental safeguard \nstandards and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). \nChange in loan market conditions \naffecting appetite and costs of funds of \nlenders to participate in the ADB PCG-\ncovered loan facility. \n\nit is anticipated that Shah Deniz Stage II (and its downstream pipeline \nprojects) will be completed within budget and on time. \nThe State Commission established a financing mechanism to cover SGC\u2019s \nfinancing needs for the project (and the pipeline projects), obliging SOCAR \nto direct net revenues earned by it from its 10% participating interest in \nShah Deniz and the pipeline projects to an equity injection in SGC. \nOil price forecasts from international market consultants, providing best \navailable projections, are adopted.   \n\nThe operator (BP) produces environmental and social monitoring reports \nbased on international practices that are acceptable to ADB. Progress is \nscrutinized by all participating shareholders, which are internationally \nreputable companies.  \nMacroeconomic indicators and responses to commercial market soundings \nhave been positive. The market for PCG-covered loans is relatively stable \nas lenders take limited credit exposure on the Government of Azerbaijan. \nLead arrangers are incentivized by an all-in pricing grid-based structuring \nfee to achieve lowest pricing to SGC. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  PCG  =  partial  credit  guarantee,  SGC  =  Southern  Gas  Corridor  Closed-Joint  Stock \nCompany, SOCAR = State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and SGC acknowledged that ADB will require the  commercial lenders \n36. \nto include in the loan agreement with SGC (to be negotiated) certain undertakings arising from \nADB  policy  requirements  with  respect  to  the  project,  including  those  concerning  prohibition  of \ncorruption, money laundering and financing of terrorism, safeguards, gender, and procurement, \nas  well  as  appropriate  reporting  requirements.  SGC  will  be  required  to  provide  cash  call \nstatements,  payment  notice  statements,  and  proofs  of  payment  for  the  project  cash  calls  and \ndeferred sales and purchase agreement progress payments to ADB to substantiate the intended \nuse of proceeds of the ADB-guaranteed loan. \n \n37. \nAs  a  condition  to  effectiveness  of  the  PCG,  a  sovereign  counter-guarantee  and \nindemnity issued by the Republic of Azerbaijan in favor of ADB shall have been duly executed \n                                                \n36 ADB. 2003.
