I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npartial credit guarantee (PCG) for the Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project.1 The PCG will \nbe issued to credit enhance loans extended by eligible commercial lenders to the Southern Gas \nCorridor Closed Joint-Stock Company (SGC) for its financing needs for the project, covering up \nto $500 million in principal amounts plus regular interest and guarantee fees payable thereon.2 \n2.  The project will increase Shah Deniz gas field\u2019s annual gas production capacity from 9.8 \nbillion cubic meters (bcm) in 2015 to 26 bcm by 2022.3 The additional gas will be exported to \nEurope, Georgia and Turkey. This is the first step in creating the Southern Gas Corridor as an \nalternative for gas deliveries to Europe from the Caspian region and the Middle East. The \nproject supports regional cooperation and integration, a core operational area in Strategy 2020 \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),4 and  will  improve  Europe\u2019s  energy  security  by \ndiversifying  its  gas  sources.  Sustained  revenues  from  gas  exports  will  fund  social  and \ninfrastructure spending to help diversify Azerbaijan\u2019s economy away from its dependency on \nhydrocarbons. The project will create over 19,000 temporary and 1,800 permanent local jobs.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economy and energy sector. Azerbaijan has extensive energy resources, with proven \noil reserves in excess of 7 billion barrels and over 1,100 bcm of natural gas reserves. In 2015, it \nproduced  841,000  barrels  of  oil  and  18.2  bcm  of  gas.5 Since  1994,  the  government  has \nsuccessfully pursued a strategy of developing the oil and gas sector as the country\u2019s primary \nsource of economic growth. It has been operated in line with international best practices and \nunder a predictable contractual framework, attracting strong private sector participation with an \nestimated $60 billion in foreign direct investment in the country during 1994\u22122014.6 In 2014, the \nenergy sector employed about 1.4% of Azerbaijan\u2019s officially reported workforce of 4.6 million. \n4.  Azerbaijan\u2019s rapid transition to an upper middle-income country has been made possible \nby the exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources, high levels of public expenditure, and market-\nbased economic reforms.7 The associated high growth rates since 2001 have resulted in a \nsignificant drop in the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line: from \n49% in 2001 to 5% in 2013. The oil and gas industry has played an important role in poverty \nreduction, with hydrocarbons contributing approximately 31% of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct and approximately 87% of the country\u2019s total gross exports in 2015.8  \n5.  Azerbaijan  has  an  extensive  gas  network,  and  is  a  net  exporter  of  oil,  gas,  and \nelectricity. Through the State Program on Socioeconomic Development of Baku City and its \n                                                \n1  The  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a \nnonsovereign loan to Lukoil Overseas Shah Deniz to finance its stake in the project in 2015 and is proposing a \nsimilar $500 million loan to SGC for the same project.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n3  The project finances the Shah Deniz Stage II expansion of the gas field and production facilities and additional \ncapital expenditure requirements and operational expenditure outlays related to the Shah Deniz Stage I project. \n4  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n8  Standards & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. 2016. Azerbaijan Country Rating Update, 29 January. London. ", "2 \nSettlements, Azerbaijan\u2019s gasification rate increased from 78.5% in 2013 to 86.7% in 2015; the \ngovernment plans to reach 90% national gasification by 2018. The power sector is the largest \ngas consumer. Over 90% of power is generated using gas, and power generation consumes \nabout half of the 9.8 bcm of gas consumed annually. The electrification rate is 100%. Gas is \ncurrently exported to Iran, Georgia, and Turkey. Diversification of the export base by accessing \nlarger  markets  is  needed  to  secure  stable  revenues  from  gas  production.  Economic \ndiversification to reduce reliance on the hydrocarbon sector has been a significant challenge.  \n6.  Project. The Shah Deniz gas condensate field is located about 70 kilometers offshore, \nsoutheast of Baku, Azerbaijan. It is one of the largest gas fields in the world, with over 1,000 \nbcm of gas.9 The Shah Deniz gas field development is a public\u2013private partnership between \nAzerbaijan and five international companies, led by BP (through its subsidiary, BP Exploration \n[Azerbaijan]) as the operator. Shah Deniz gas will be exported to Europe, via Georgia, Turkey, \nGreece, and Albania (the Southern Gas Corridor).10 Exploration, development, and production \nare governed by the Shah Deniz production sharing agreement (PSA), which was executed in \n1996.11 BP is responsible for the development and operation of the gas field and the laying and \noperation of the South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion. All other Shah Deniz PSA partners are \nacting purely as financial investors, and not involved in day-to-day operations.12   \n7.   The Shah Deniz gas field is being developed in two stages. The initial development, \nShah Deniz Stage I (Shah Deniz-l) began production in 2006. Despite the use of pioneering \ntechnologies, it was developed in only 7 years and has become a reliable gas supplier to \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Full gas field development under Shah Deniz Stage II (Shah \nDeniz-II) is underway, with about 93% of procurement and 72% of construction completed. \nCompletion of full field development of the Shah Deniz is on target, with gas scheduled to be \nsupplied to Georgia and Turkey in late 2018, and to Europe in 2020. Once completed, Shah \nDeniz-II will produce 16 bcm of gas per annum, in addition to the 9.8 bcm from Shah Deniz-l. \nDaily production of gas condensate will increase from 45,000 barrels to 105,000 barrels.  \n8.  The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), a vertically integrated state-\nowned oil and gas company, is responsible for the exploration, exploitation, and marketing of \npetroleum and petrochemical products in domestic and international markets. The State Oil \nFund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) was established in 1999 to convert the country\u2019s \nhydrocarbon reserves into financial assets that generate perpetual income.  \n9.  To ensure the success of the fully developed Shah Deniz gas field and gas delivery to \nEurope, in October 2013 the President of Azerbaijan signed a decree establishing a State \nCommission.13 A  subsequent  presidential  decree  in  February  2014  established  SGC  to \nconsolidate the financing and management of Azerbaijan\u2019s ownership interests in Shah Deniz \nand  the transmission  of gas to  Europe.14 SGC,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  SGC \nUpstream (SGCU), acquired a 6.67% interest in Shah Deniz and contracted to purchase an \n                                                \n9  BP. Shah Deniz Stage I Project. http://www.bp.com/en_az/caspian/operationsprojects/Shahdeniz/SDstage1.html. \n10  The Southern Gas Corridor comprises (i) the South Caucasus Pipeline and South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion  \nfrom the Sangachal Terminal in Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey; (ii) the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline through \nTurkey and Greece; and (iii) the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline through Albania and the Adriatic Sea to southern Italy. \nLong-term gas offtake agreements are in place. \n11  While currently in effect until 2036, the Shah Deniz PSA may be extended until 2048.   \n12  Current Shah Deniz PSA partners are BP (28.83%), Turkish Petroleum Overseas (19.00%), Petronas (15.50%), \nNaftiran Intertrade (10.00%), Lukoil (10.00%), SOCAR (10.00%), and SGC (6.67%).  \n13 The State Commission was established by the Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan to oversee the \ntransportation of Azeri natural gas to world markets along the Southern Gas Corridor, dated 29 October 2013. \n14  SGC is 51% owned by the Republic of Azerbaijan, represented by the Ministry of Economy, and 49% by SOCAR. \n ", "3 \nadditional 10% interest (the completion of which is expected to take place in 2023), from \nSOCAR\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) Limited (AzSD).15 SGC\u2019s indirect \nstake  in  BP\u2019s  cash  call  contributions  and  its  concurrent  investments  in  the  Southern  Gas \nCorridor  to  date  have  been  financed  by  (i)  approximately  $1.7  billion  in  equity  from  its \nshareholders, (ii) $2.5 billion in 10-year SGC bonds subscribed by SOFAZ, (iii) $1.0 billion in 10-\nyear Eurobonds issued in March 2016, and (iv) revenues generated by the Shah Deniz-I and \nSouth Caucasus Pipeline projects.   \n10.  The 10% interest held by AzSD will be transferred to SGCU upon completion of closing \nconditions, which include the full and unconditional repayment in 2023 of certain outstanding \nbonds issued by SOCAR. The deferred sales and purchase agreement provides that SGCU will \nmake progress payments for the cash call requirements of the 10% interest, and AzSD will \ncontinue to meet all expenditures, receive all income, and perform all obligations relating to the \n10% interest.16  Pursuant to the Resolution of the State Commission of July 2014,17 all revenues \nreceived by SOCAR from this 10% interest are to be used to support SGC\u2019s financing needs. \n11.   Financing need. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n12.  Low  hydrocarbon  prices  and  consequential  unfavorable  financial  market  conditions \nresulted in the government requesting multilateral financing institutions to help finance the Shah \nDeniz-II and the pipeline projects, totaling $51 billion in aggregate investments by 2020. ADB \nhas been requested to consider financing SGC\u2019s cash calls for Shah Deniz-II. To help overcome \nadverse market conditions, it is proposed for ADB to (i) issue a PCG covering up to $500 million \nin principal payments plus interest and guarantee fees against the non-honoring of a Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  guarantee  to  commercial  banks  for  SGC\u2019s  borrowing,  and  (ii)  provide  a \nnonsovereign loan of up to $500 million.18 The government may request further support from \nADB for 2018\u22122020 cash calls should financing costs through the financial markets remain high. \n13.  Development impact. Globally depressed oil prices and the halving of the value of the \nAzerbaijan manat against the United States dollar in 2015 have placed pressure on Azerbaijan\u2019s \neconomic growth and balance of payments. As a result, government revenues and the country\u2019s \nforeign exchange reserves have decreased significantly. The downgrading of Azerbaijan\u2019s credit \nrating in early 2016 increased Azerbaijan\u2019s financing costs and adversely affected access to \ncommercial funds. SOFAZ was responsible for 50.8% of the national budget in 2014 and 46.5% \nin 2015.19 Low oil and gas prices, however, have decreased SOFAZ\u2019s net holdings. \n14.  ADB assistance to SGC to meet financial commitments to Shah Deniz will allow SOFAZ \nand the government to use oil and gas revenues for social expenditures and continued efforts to \ndiversify the economy away from the oil and gas sector. Based on a diagnostic analysis of the \neconomy, the government has identified priority sectors20 to help achieve such diversification as \nspecified  in  a  2016  presidential  order,  providing  basic  directions  to  develop  a  new \n                                                \n15 SGC\u2019s initial 6.67% interest was purchased from SOCAR in 2014, which SOCAR purchased from Statoil in 2013. \n16 Finalization of project documentation, including the PCG, will be subject to satisfactory legal due diligence on AzSD \nbeing completed and appropriate contractual provisions applicable to AzSD being agreed with AzSD and SGC. \n17 Resolution of the State Commission on determination of the financing mechanism of the Projects by Southern Gas \nCorridor CJSC (SGC) in order to ensure the operation of the Southern Gas Corridor in connection with the \ntransportation of Azerbaijani Gas to world markets. 9 July 2014. \n18 ADB.

Baku. \n20 These sectors include agriculture, manufacturing, logistics, tourism, and education (vocational training).  \n ", "4 \ncomprehensive national economic vision.21 These sectors are relatively more labor intensive \nand  their further  development  is  expected to  have  a  positive  impact on  employment,  and \nparticularly demand for skilled jobs. The government\u2019s focus on vocational  training is  also \nexpected to accommodate such increase in demand for skilled jobs.   \n15.  Added value of the partial credit guarantee. The use of the PCG is essential for SGC \nto continue meeting its financial obligations toward the Shah Deniz gas field expansion and \npipeline projects through private sector participation, despite the current unfavorable market \nconditions. Without ADB\u2019s credit enhancement, SGC\u2019s ability to meet its participation obligations \nwith funding from commercial lenders is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Although ADB\u2019s \nPCG will help lower SGC\u2019s cost of financing, it reflects commercially feasible risk-based pricing \nfor an export revenue-generating project, while sharing underlying project and commercial risks \nwith commercial lenders for the uncovered portion. In contrast to making a direct loan, the \nproposed PCG instrument allows ADB to leverage the use of its own capital resources.   \n16.  ADB  support.  ADB\u2019s  support for government efforts  to  improve  the sector  include \ninterventions in energy efficiency, power sector financial sustainability, renewable energy, and \nprivate sector participation.22 The government reaffirmed its commitment to addressing sector \nissues  through  the  2016  presidential  order  (footnote  21),  and  the  draft  State  Program  on \nEfficient Use of Energy Resources and  Energy Efficiency of End Customers (2016\u22122020), \nwhich calls for tariff reforms to recover costs and achieve commercially viable operations.23   \n17.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 (footnote 7) has a focus on energy. The \nproject aligns with the commitment by ADB to provide catalytic solutions for upper middle-\nincome countries like Azerbaijan under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.24 It supports two \nStrategy 2020 core operation areas (infrastructure and regional cooperation and integration) \nand one strategic driver of change (catalyzing investments through private sector participation).  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The impact of the project is aligned with sustained revenues from oil and gas exports, \nwhich will facilitate diversification of the country\u2019s economy.25 The outcome will be increased \nproduction and exports of gas from the Shah Deniz gas field. The project will help diversify \nEurope\u2019s energy sources and contribute to the development of multi-seller, multi-buyer markets. \nC.  Outputs \n19.  The project\u2019s outputs are (i) Shah Deniz-II natural gas production and processing facility \nunder  construction,  (ii)  greater  efficiency  in  the  gas  sector,  and  (iii)  jobs  created  during \nconstruction and operations. The ADB PCG will help SGC secure financing, and proceed with \nthe (i) construction of two new bridge-linked oil platforms, (ii) drilling of 26 new subsea wells, (iii) \nconstruction of a new 500\u2013kilometer subsea pipelines, (iv) consolidation of the government\u2019s \ninterests in Shah Deniz within a single entity, and (v) creation of over 19,000 temporary and \n                                                \n21  Government of Azerbaijan. 2016.

While these analyses show the project\u2019s financial and economic viability, SGC faces a \nchallenge  in  raising  commercial  financing  to  meet  its  sizable  upcoming  financing  needs. \nHowever, any shortfall will be covered by additional contributions from SGC shareholders in \naccordance  with  a  State  Commission  resolution  (footnote  17),  providing  an  established \nmitigation mechanism to the potential challenge.   \n \n                                                \n32  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  Report of lenders\u2019 technical advisor for Azerbaijan: Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project (July 2016).  \n ", "7 \n27.  As a key source of funds for SGC, SOFAZ\u2019s financial strength was also analyzed. Its \nassets have grown rapidly from $2.5 billion in early 2008 to $35.1 billion as of mid-2016. \nHowever, the 2015 drop in oil and gas prices adversely impacted SOFAZ\u2019s revenues and asset \nbase. As of the end of 2015, the Shah Deniz gas field had contributed $2.4 billion to SOFAZ \nsince the commissioning of Shah Deniz-I in 2007. Based on the oil and gas price forecast by the \nlenders\u2019 market consultant, Shah Deniz is expected to contribute an additional $10 billion to \nSOFAZ by 2035. While SOFAZ provides security to SGC, implementation of Shah Deniz-II and \nthe pipelines will further strengthen the financial sustainability of SOFAZ. \n \nC.  Governance \n28.   SGC\u2019s financial management risk is considered moderate. While it has a sound financial \nmanagement system and structure, securing large financing in a timely manner will continue to \nbe  a  challenge.  Lack  of  experience  with  multilateral  financing  institutions  while  relying \nsubstantially on such financing is also a challenge. SGC has put forth mitigation measures by \nengaging legal and financial advisors and through the early engagement of multilateral financial \ninstitutions. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and SGC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 32). \n \n29.  Project procurement is conducted in accordance with BP\u2019s procurement practices as \nagreed among the parties to the joint operating agreement.34 The lenders\u2019 technical advisor \nconfirmed that BP Azerbaijan\u2019s procurement strategy and supply chain management are well \nestablished. With approximately 93% procured and 72% completed, the project is ahead of \nschedule and actual costs are 5% under budget. The first gas is scheduled to be delivered in \n2018. ADB is satisfied that the project\u2019s procurement has been conducted following normal \ncommercial practices, with due attention to economy and efficiency as required for procurement \nin relation to loans guaranteed by ADB. \n \n30.  Integrity due diligence was conducted by ADB's Private Sector Operations Department \n(PSOD) for its proposed nonsovereign loan (footnote 1). For this PCG proposal, the Central and \nWest Asia Regional Department has relied on the outcome of PSOD\u2019s integrity due diligence. \nNo  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  issues  were  identified  in  relation  to  SGC. \nAzerbaijan is an early member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initative (EITI) and was \ngiven compliant status in 2009. The EITI redefined its standards in 2013 and now includes more \ncomprehensive  requirements  for  civil  society  engagement.  Against  these  new  standards, \nAzerbaijan  was  downgraded  to  candidate  status  in  2015.  During  its  recent  October  2016 \nmeetings,  EITI\u2019s  board  concluded  that  Azerbaijan  has  made  meaningful  progress  with \nconsiderable improvements, maintaining the country\u2019s candidate status. The government is \nexpected to continue implementing corrective actions to regain \u201ccompliant\u2019 status in 2017. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n31.  The project will provide additional economic benefits and support government policies by \n(i) providing revenues for the development of other sectors, (ii) modernizing the oil and gas \nsector, (iii) promoting the efficient use of energy resources, and (iv) increasing sector efficiency. \nThe community engagement and workforce management plans of BP recognize key social \nissues for communities in the vicinity of the gas terminal. Specific recruitment targets for named \n                                                \n34 Shah Deniz Joint Operating Agreement dated 5 March 1997.   \n ", "8 \ncommunities  are  included  in  construction  contracts.  Over  20,000  people  were  involved  in \nconstruction activities in Azerbaijan by the end of 2015; 80% were Azerbaijani nationals.  \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n32.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project  is \nclassified category A for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous \npeoples. Potential environmental and social impacts of the project were identified and effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in \nsafeguard reports and plans. An environmental and social impacts assessment was performed \nfor  Shah  Deniz-II  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  July  2014.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS \nrequirements for financing of existing facilities, an environmental and social compliance audit \nreport (ESCAR) for the existing facilities of Shah Deniz-I was carried out in May 2014. Another \nESCAR on the ongoing Shah Deniz-II construction activities was produced in July 2015 and \nupdated in August 2016.35 The audit found the project in compliance with the ADB SPS, with no \ncorrective action plan required. SGC\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to ensure that BP \nproperly manages the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n33.  The  project  is  located  in  Sangachal  Bay  in  the  Caspian  Sea,  which  contains  high \nbiodiversity areas; the environment and social impact assessment indicates the project area is \nnot located in areas of high biodiversity. The Shah Deniz-ll contract area overlaps with the \nmigration routes and spawning areas of some fish species. The impact assessment indicates \nthat  construction  impacts  on  fish  will  be  minimal.  Fishing  is  the  dominant  threat  to  fish \npopulations in the Caspian Sea. Existing fish population monitoring programs established for \nShah Deniz-I are satisfactory to ADB and will continue. The Shah Deniz area may have some \noverlap with Caspian seal migration pathways. BP engages with and provides support to the \nCaspian Sea conservation programs. BP has in place an ecological and wildlife management \nplan. ADB will require a commercial loan provision that SGC, to the extent permissible under the \nproject agreements, procure that the operator implements the project in compliance with the \nrelevant plans and ADB\u2019s SPS requirements. \n \n34.  Under the terms of the Shah Deniz PSA, SOCAR has transferred all lands required for \nthe Shah Deniz-II project to the operator. The audit confirmed that no resettlement issues, \nincluding access rights or temporary usage of lands, existed as a result of the Shah Deniz-I \nfacilities and the sites proposed for expansion of the terminal as part of Shah Deniz-II. No \nindigenous communities are located in the project area, and no indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts are \nexpected.  The  operator  has  prepared  and  implemented  a  small-scale  fishing  livelihood \nmanagement plan to address economic displacement of 48 fishermen. All affected fishermen \nhave  resumed  their  fishing  activities  at  the  same  location,  except  for  six  fishermen,  who \nvoluntarily chose to move to another location about 40 kilometers from the Sangachal Bay. \nThese fishermen have reported additional impacts due to increased transportation costs and the \nlower  productivity  at  the  new  fishing  location.  The  operator  is  trying  to  address  these \nunanticipated impacts in consultation with the affected fishermen. The operator will monitor \nimplementation of the fishing livelihood management plan and prepare a closure report once all \nresidual  grievances  are  satisfactorily  addressed.  Through  ADB-required  commercial  loan \nprovisions, SGC will be required to procure to the extent possible under its project powers that \nthe  operator  complies  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \n                                                \n35 Earlier drafts of the ESCAR were disclosed on the ADB website beginning in mid-2015; the final ESCAR was \ndisclosed on 28 September 2016. \n ", "9 \nStrategy, will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards.36 \nSimilarly,  SGC  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  the  compliance  of  the  operator  (and  its \ncontractors) with such laws. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people are \nexpected to be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.37 Such reports will be similar \nin scope and contents to the ESCAR. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the risk  assessment  and risk management  plan.38 The  project\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPipelines are not completed as planned.
