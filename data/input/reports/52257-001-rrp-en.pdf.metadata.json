THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Expanded Social Assistance Project (ESAP).  \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the Government of the Philippines\u2019 Pantawid Pamilyang \nPilipino Program (4Ps) by financing a portion of the education and health conditional cash \ntransfers (CCTs) provided to poor households; strengthening compliance verification, payroll, and \ngrievance redress systems of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD); \nbuilding linkages with complementary social programs; and improving project management, \nmonitoring, and impact evaluation. The ESAP will build on the ongoing support of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for the 4Ps CCT program since 2010.1 It will support the DSWD in \nfulfilling  its  vision  of  \u201call  Filipinos  free  from  hunger  and  poverty,  having  equal  access  to \nopportunities, enabled by a fair, just, and peaceful society.\u201d2 While the ESAP had been planned \nas part of the Country Partnership Strategy 2018\u20132023 and included in the Country Operations \nBusiness Plan  2020\u20132022, well before the Philippines was hit by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19), it will benefit the poor and vulnerable 4Ps households even more in the post COVID-\n19 situation given the significant adverse health, social, and economic impact of the pandemic.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic performance until COVID-19. The Philippines grew at an average annual rate \nof 6.5% in 2012\u20132019. Unemployment fell from 7.0% in 2012 to 5.3% in 2018. The quality of jobs \nimproved, with the share of wage and salary workers growing from 57.2% in 2012 to 63.8% in \n2018. The poverty rate declined from 25.2% in 2012 to 23.3% in 2015 and to 16.6% in 2018, \nwhich translates to 17.6 million people living below the poverty line.4 The National Economic and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) attributed the increase in the income of the poorest 30% to, \namong other things, the implementation and expansion of the government\u2019s social assistance \nprograms, especially the 4Ps.5 The annual budget for the 4Ps grew from $422.31 million in 2011 \nto $1.77 billion in 2019. The number of target beneficiary households increased from 2.30 million \nto 4.25 million over this period. Unfortunately, owing to the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic \nand the community quarantines imposed across the country, the economy\u2014and therefore, poor \nhouseholds including the 4Ps\u2014have been hit badly. Projections show that gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth may potentially fall to -1% in 2020 (footnote 3).  \n \n4.  Development problem. Despite the steady economic performance between 2012\u20132019, \nlevels of poverty and inequality in the Philippines remain high. Approximately 14.2 million people \n \n1  ADB. 2010.

An estimated 5.5 million Filipinos are expected to fall into poverty, which will increase the \npoverty incidence from 16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. (footnote 3).  \n \n5.  4Ps design and conditionalities. The 4Ps was launched by the government in 2008 to \nhelp poor households improve the education and health of their children so that they can escape \npoverty. Initially, only households below the poverty line, with children younger than 14 years \nand/or with pregnant women, as identified by the National Household Targeting System for \nPoverty Reduction in 2009 (Listahanan 1), were included under the 4Ps.9 With the launch of the \nKindergarten to Grade 12 Program in 2013, which extended schooling from grade 10 to grade 12, \nthe 4Ps raised the age cap of children from 14 to 18 years to enable them to complete senior high \nschool. In 2008, the conditional cash grants were set as follows:10 \n \n(i)  For the education grant, 4Ps households would receive \u20b1300 per month for 10 \nmonths annually for children in day care, elementary school, and junior high school \n(i.e., up to grade 10) provided they are enrolled in school and attend at least 85% \nof the classes each month. Each household could register up to three children for \nthe education grant. With effect from 2015, 4Ps households started receiving \u20b1500 \nper month for 10 months annually for children in senior high school provided their \nattendance was at least 85% each month.  \n \n(ii)  For the health grant, 4Ps households would receive a fixed amount of \u20b1500 per \nmonth for 12 months (irrespective of the number of children), provided they fulfill \nthe following conditions:  \n \n(a)  pregnant women avail themselves of pre- and postnatal care, and are \nattended during childbirth by trained health professionals;  \n(b)  parents attend regular family development sessions (FDS);  \n(c)  children 0\u20135 years old receive regular preventive health checkups and \nvaccination; and  \n(d)  children 6\u201314 years old receive deworming pills twice a year.  \n \n6.  Households exit from the 4Ps when all their children receiving education grants reach 18 \nyears of age and/or graduate from senior high school, or if they fail to comply with the conditions \ndespite repeated reminders. \n \n \n6  PSA. 2018.

World Development \nIndicators online (accessed 28 November 2019).  \n9  A proxy means test\u2013based standardized targeting survey identified poor households. Households with children under \n14 years old and/or with pregnant women were selected for the 4Ps. \n10 The cash grants were not indexed to inflation. According to the DSWD, the real value of the cash grant declined from \nabout 23% of the poverty line in 2008 to about 9% by 2018. \n ", "3 \n7.  4Ps expansion since 2008. The coverage of active households under the 4Ps increased \nfrom 337,418 in 2008 to 2.30 million in 2011, 4.00 million in 2014, and 4.25 million in 2019. The \n4Ps covers 17 regions, 80 provinces, 145 cities, 1,482 municipalities, and 41,539 barangays.11 \nAs of 29 February 2020, 4.28 million households nationwide were eligible for 4Ps.12 About 85.3% \nof these are headed by female grantees. Currently, 643,414 households of indigenous people \n(15.0% of total 4Ps households) are covered. Approximately, 7.88 million children, 3\u201318 years \nold (51.7% females), are registered under the 4Ps. About 52.9% are between 6\u201314 years old. \nSchool attendance of 5,493,415 children is being monitored. More than 94% of these children \nmaintain at least 85% attendance. Of all children under 5 years who are monitored for health \n(212,000 in 2020 out of total 298,516 children under 5 years), about 97% avail themselves of \ngrowth monitoring and regular health checkups. As of 29 February 2020, 86.4% of the 4P \nhouseholds had cash cards, while the rest relied on over-the-counter payments. The Land Bank \nof the Philippines (LBP) aims to distribute cash cards to all 4Ps households by the end of 2020. \n \n8.  Support services provided under the 4Ps. The 4Ps also supports community education \nand empowerment through monthly FDSs. Topics include gender equity, family planning and birth \nspacing, protection of women and children against all forms of violence and exploitation, pre- and \npostnatal care, and recognition of the rights and respect for the culture and beliefs of indigenous \npeoples.13 The FDSs include modules on responsible parenthood, early childhood care and \ndevelopment, prevention of child sexual abuse, teenage pregnancy, and drug abuse, food and \nnutrition,  sanitation,  disaster  preparedness,  financial  literacy,  and  active  citizenship  among \nothers. Youth development sessions (YDS) are conducted for adolescent youth to help develop \nand enhance their life coping skills, offer positive perspectives on life, and nurture their character \ntowards individual growth and personality development.14 \n \n9.  Impact on poverty. Transfers from government social programs contributed about 25% \nof poverty reduction in 2006\u20132015.15 The 4Ps expanded rapidly during this period and became \nthe largest social assistance program in the Philippines. Estimates show that the 4Ps helped \nreduce the national poverty rate by up to 1.5 percentage points, lifted 1.5 million people out of \npoverty, and reduced national income inequality by 0.6 percentage points. The 4Ps households \nbenefit from short-term (provision of cash grant) and long-term (investment in education and \nhealth) interventions. Spending on social assistance and social safety nets has had a greater \nimpact in the Philippines than in other countries even though the quantum of such spending \nrelative to GDP at 0.67% is lower than the global average of 1.5% during 2013\u20132014.16 While the \nCOVID-19 pandemic will erode some of the gains made in  terms of reducing poverty, by \nsupporting the 4Ps, the ESAP will help to address some of these losses. \n \n \n11 A barangay is the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines. There are currently 42,046 barangays as of 31 \nMarch 2020.  \n12 The number of poor households that the 4Ps can cover is capped at 4.4 million. Coverage increased steadily from \n2008 and reached the cap by 2017. The number of households covered in February 2020 is lower owing to the exit \nof households whose children (receiving education grants) turned 18 years old and/or graduated from senior high \nschool, as required under the 4Ps. \n13 Including discussions on gender marginalization, subordination, multiple burdens, gender stereotyping, violence \nagainst women, and domestic violence. The 4Ps case management and referral pathways manual guides project \nimplementers in handling child protection and gender-based violence. \n14 Topics include physical and cognitive development, social and emotional development, mental health, changes \nduring the teenage years, sexuality, and adolescent sexual reproductive health (including menstruation, pregnancy, \nand birth control). \n15 World Bank. 2018.

The Philippine Institute for Development Studies completed the \nthird impact evaluation of the 4Ps in  January 2020. It used data from household surveys \nconducted  in  November\u2013December  2017.17  Additional  ADB  analysis  confirms  that  the  4Ps \nincreases utilization of health services, improves key educational outcomes, enhances children\u2019s \nsocioemotional skills, and raises household consumption.18  Around 83% of 4Ps households have \nat least four prenatal checkups as compared to 74% of non-4Ps households. The enrollment rate \nfor children aged 16\u201317 years in 4Ps households (88%) is significantly higher than that for children \nin non-4Ps households (70%). Improvement is greater for girls (31%) than boys (15%). Grit or \ndetermination,  a  key  socioemotional  skill,  is  higher  among  children  of  4Ps  households. \nEmployment and labor force participation outcomes are not lowered, which implies that the 4Ps \ndoes not induce dependency. The 4Ps households spend significantly more on food and school-\nsupplies. The incidence of hunger is lower for 4Ps households. However, ADB analysis finds that \nthe gains are confined to children being monitored for compliance with conditionalities, and that \nthere are adverse effects on children who are not monitored. Administrative data show that the \nnumber of children aged 0\u20135 years being monitored for health conditionalities fell from 2 million \nin 2013 to 212,000 by February 2020. The reasons for this decline need to be analyzed and \nregistration and monitoring of newborn children strengthened.19 \n \n11.  4Ps institutionalization. To reinforce its efforts to reduce poverty, vulnerability, and \nincome inequality, the government signed the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program Act (Republic \nAct 11310) into law on 17 April 2019.20 The law raises the grant amounts set in 2008.21 This \nunderscores the government\u2019s continued commitment to support the 4Ps. The law will ensure \nsustainability through adequate budget allocation and other government support. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  past  engagement.  The  design  of  the  ESAP  draws  on  ADB\u2019s  decade-long \nexperience of supporting the 4Ps (footnote 1). It incorporates the findings of the joint review \nmissions held twice each year with development partners, including Australia\u2019s Department of \nForeign Affairs and Trade, the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund, and the \nWorld Bank. The $400 million Social Protection Support Project (SPSP) helped to establish the \nnational poverty targeting system and supported the 4Ps implementation and evaluation (footnote \n1). It closed in June 2017. The SPSP-Additional Financing (SPSP-AF), which was approved in \n2016, funded a share of the cash grants for education and health to more than 4 million \nhouseholds nationwide (footnote 1). It disbursed the entire $400 million by January 2020 and was \nexpected to close in June 2020. However, at the government\u2019s request, a second additional \nfinancing loan for $200 million has been processed to provide unconditional emergency cash \nassistance of between \u20b15,000\u2013\u20b18,000 per month for 2 months to approximately 3.67 million 4Ps \nhouseholds (having cash cards) to help them cope with the adverse economic impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic (footnote 3). To date, ADB has provided cumulative technical assistance \n(TA)  support  of  $4.7  million  to  support  capacity  development,  implementation,  gender \nmainstreaming, and other reforms. \n \n \n17  Philippine Institute for Development Studies and DSWD.

The education grant per child (for a maximum of 10 months per year) enrolled in day care and elementary \nschool programs will remain at \u20b1300 per month. The grant for junior high school students has been increased from \n\u20b1300 to \u20b1500 per month, and that for senior high school students from \u20b1500 to \u20b1700 per month. \n ", "5 \n13.  Lessons learned. Key lessons from ADB engagement include the following: \n \n(i)  Update the list of beneficiaries. The 4Ps continues to be based on the list of \npoor households identified in 2009 by the Listahanan 1. Since the list of eligible \nhouseholds is 10 years old, it reduces the credibility of the targeting. It is timely \nthat the National Household Targeting Office of the DSWD is undertaking a \nnational  survey  (from  October  2019  to  August  2020)  of  nearly  16.1  million \nhouseholds, based on a new standardized targeting test (Listahanan 3) to update \nthe list of poor and near-poor (1.1 times the poverty line) households.22 This survey \nwill cover all rural barangays and the pockets of poverty in urban barangays. The \nfinal list of poor households is expected to be available by the end of 2020. \nThereafter,  the  DSWD\u2019s  National  Program  Management  Office  (NPMO)  will \nidentify households eligible for the 4Ps, i.e., poor households with children aged \n0\u201318 years old and/or with women pregnant at the time of registration. The \ntransition to the updated list of households eligible for the 4Ps is expected to be \ncompleted by January 2022. ADB will support this process as requested. \n \n(ii)  Expand payment options. The LBP has been the main payment partner of the \n4Ps since 2008. While the number of 4Ps households has grown rapidly over the \nyears, the LBP has not been able to keep pace with the demand for additional \nbranches and automated teller machines (ATMs).23 Owing to the 4Ps\u2019 near-total \nreliance on the LBP and its conduits, payments to 4Ps households are often \ndelayed. When beneficiaries try to withdraw from ATMs of other banks or from \npoints of sale, they are charged \u20b130\u2013\u20b150 per transaction. The DSWD must \ncontinue discussions with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the \nPhilippines) and the Department of Finance on how to expand payment options for \nbeneficiaries and tap financial technology solutions to make timely payments.  \n \n(iii)  Use IT solutions to reduce burden of implementation. The DSWD requires the \nsupport of the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Interior and Local \nGovernment (DILG), and the Department of Education (DepEd) to implement a \ncomplex  and  multifaceted  program  such  as  the  4Ps  effectively.24  Given  the \nexpansion in the number of beneficiaries since 2009 and the need to draw on data \nfrom  thousands  of  partner  schools  and  health  facilities,  the  burden  of  4Ps \nimplementation has grown significantly. Every two months, DSWD field staff visit \nhundreds of households, collect records from dozens of schools and clinics, and \nupdate the information manually. The process is tedious and prone to errors. ADB \nwill provide TA to help modernize the DSWD\u2019s information technology systems and \nstrengthen linkages with the IT systems of DepEd and DOH (para. 18[i]). \n \n14.  Strategic  alignment.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan  2017\u20132022  aims  to  reduce \npoverty to 14% by 2022. It emphasizes the need to accelerate human capital development and \nreduce vulnerability to various risks. The 4Ps is a critical part of the government\u2019s strategy to \nachieve universal and transformative social protection. The ESAP will support the development \n \n22 ADB provided inputs for the design of the proxy means testing model, which was accepted by the DSWD and the \nNational Technical Advisory Board as the basis of Listahanan 3. \n23 The LBP has only 396 main branches, 49 sub-branches, 10 mobiles, and 1,969 ATMs, compared with more than \n12,000 branches nationwide operated by other banks (including private banks). \n24 The DOH, in partnership with local government units, ensures the availability of supplies and services for the health \nand nutrition components.

The project is aligned with the third pillar of ADB\u2019s Philippines country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132023 which emphasizes investing in people by focusing on human development, \nsocial protection, financial inclusion, and social innovation.25 Table 1 provides the linkage between \nthe ESAP and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.26 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project \nAddressing remaining  The project will fund part of the CCTs to at least 4.25 million poor households, \npoverty and reducing  thereby improving the education and health of their children and helping them \ninequalities  to escape poverty.

Choice of modality. The project loan modality worked well for SPSP and SPSP-AF. The \nprotocols for tracking overall performance and results through joint review missions involving all \ndevelopment partners, spot checks, and rigorous impact evaluations are well established. The \nWorld  Bank  has  been  using  the  project  modality  for  its  loans  for  the  4Ps.27  Effective \nimplementation of a CCT program involves targeting, verification, coordination with multiple \nagencies, complex payment systems, and ongoing engagement with millions of households. It \nmay be difficult to maintain this level of ground-level engagement involving ADB, development \npartners, and the DSWD through policy-based loans, which are more \u201cmacro\u201d in nature. Results-\nbased lending is not appropriate since finding distinct disbursement-linked indicators is difficult. \nEven  though  the  education  and  health  conditionalities  (para.  5)  are  different,  the  4Ps \nimplementation is holistic. The support provided by the DSWD field staff to households combines \nelements of education and health conditionalities and general counselling. These cannot be \nseparated into distinct disbursement-linked indicators. Since the share of ADB and the World \nBank is smaller (6%\u201310%) than the government\u2019s total annual expenditures on the 4Ps, project \ninvestment with statement of expenditure-based reimbursements is appropriate. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25 ADB. 2018.

Project Description \n \n16.  The proposed ESAP is aligned with the following impact: a universal and transformative \nsocial protection system that builds socioeconomic resilience.28 The project will have the following \noutcome: education and health profile of the children of 4Ps households improved. The ESAP will \nachieve this outcome by supporting the following output:  \n \n17.  Conditional cash transfers delivered effectively and on time. The project will finance \na share of the CCT grants to eligible and compliant poor households with children aged 0\u201318 \nyears and/or with pregnant women. Effective December 2019, 4Ps households have started to \nreceive grants at the higher rates specified in the 4Ps law (footnote 22).29 By 1 January 2022, the \nDSWD is expected to transition to the Listahanan 3 to identify eligible households. \n \n18.  The entire $500 million loan proceeds will be used for the above output. To ensure that \ncash grants for eligible poor households are transferred in a targeted, efficient, and timely manner, \nADB will provide the following support through the ongoing Strengthening Social Protection \nReforms TA facility:30 \n \n(i)  CCT delivery systems strengthened (supported by the TA facility). During \neach payout period, DSWD staff coordinate with 84,007 education facilities and \n23,607 local health facilities to verify compliance with the conditionalities. To \nimprove coordination with multiple agencies, ADB will help the DSWD to (a) \nprepare road maps for IT reforms to improve business processes and streamline \ncompliance verification, beneficiary data, payroll, and grievance redress systems; \n(b) upgrade the DSWD\u2019s Pantawid Pamilyang Information System and link it to \nDepEd\u2019s  Learner  Information  System  (LIS)31  to  automate  the  verification  of \neducation  (attendance)  data  and  to  the  DOH\u2019s  Integrated  Clinic  Information \nSystem (i-ClinicSys)32 to do the same for health-related compliance data; and (c) \nexplore innovative technology solutions for government-to-person payments to \nsupport financial inclusion. \n \n(ii)  Awareness  building,  connections  with  complementary  social  programs, \nproject management, and evaluation capacity strengthened (supported by \nthe TA facility). \n \n(a)  FDS and YDS modules updated. Assistance will be provided to review \nand improve the FDS Manual and selected modules (e.g., sanitation and \nhygiene, teenage pregnancy, drugs, livelihood, and disaster resilience), \nincorporate gender and cultural sensitivity in the learning material, and \n \n28 Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017. Philippine Development Plan \n2017\u20132022. Pasig City. \n29 Since 2017, 4Ps households have been receiving an additional \u20b1600 per month as rice subsidy along with their \npayment for CCTs. The project will finance only the CCT grants for education and health, not the rice subsidy. \n30 The TA, Strengthening Social Protection Reforms, in the amount of $1 million was attached to the Social Protection \nSupport Project-Additional Financing which was approved in 2016. This was converted into a transaction TA facility \n(with the same name) in November 2018, with additional funding of $1 million to support the design and \nimplementation of the ESAP. \n31 The LIS is the national online registry of all students enrolled in schools (public and private), state and local \nuniversities and colleges, and higher education institutions offering Kindergarten to Grade 12. It includes personal \ndata and enrollment history of students and identifies those who are recipients of the 4Ps cash grants.  \n32 i-ClinicSys is an electronic medical record and health information system to support the functions of primary care \nfacilities and barangay health stations. It automates service delivery processes to monitor patient care efficiently. \n ", "8 \ntranslate the updated FDS Manual into three local languages (Filipino, \nIlocano,  and  Bisaya).  The  design  of  information,  education  and \ncommunication (IEC) material will be improved to raise awareness and \noutreach. To ensure effective delivery of the new FDS material, ADB will \nsupport training of facilitators. Assistance will be provided to complete six \nvolumes of YDS modules.33 \n \n(b)  Innovative \u201cgraduation\u201d approaches developed. Since 2016, ADB has \nbeen undertaking a graduation pilotwith the Department of Labor and \nEmployment targeting 1,800 4Ps households across 5 municipalities in \nNegros Occidental. 34 Based on this pilot, ADB will help the DSWD design \nand administer sequenced and time-bound interventions to help up to \n3,000 4Ps households in selected sites from regions I, VI, X, and XII \n\u201cgraduate\u201d out of poverty through sustainable livelihood assistance. This \nwill form part of the DSWD\u2019s COVID-19 recovery program.  \n \n(c)  Project management and evaluation capacity strengthened. Support \nwill  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  DSWD\u2019s  project  and  financial \nmanagement capacity as required. ADB will provide inputs for the design \nof the fourth impact evaluation scheduled in 2021\u20132023. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  Improved IT-based business processes. The proposed support for IT reforms and \nlinking of the management information systems will add value by unlocking significant gains in \noperational efficiency and reliability of compliance verification and beneficiary updates. This will \nreduce the huge burden of compliance verification on DSWD field staff and free up their time for \ncase management and outreach. The reforms will also prepare the DSWD for progressive linkage \nwith the unique foundational identity number, PhilSys, which will help 4Ps households open bank \naccounts (by fulfilling know-your-customer requirements) and enable direct benefits transfers to \n4Ps households. These reforms will strengthen the governance and institutional capacity of the \nDSWD  by  streamlining  its  IT-based  business  processes,  harmonizing  its  management \ninformation systems, and improving coordination and data sharing across agencies. \n \n20.  Relevance of ESAP in the context of COVID-19. The ESAP reaches out to around 4.28 \nmillion of the poorest households of the Philippines. While their participation in the 4Ps over the \nyears has improved their education and health profiles, especially of their children, the adverse \nimpact of COVID-19 may push some of these households to distress and poverty once again. \nThe ESAP will continue ADB\u2019s support for these households and ensure that the positive \nbehavioral changes with respect to education and health seeking behavior, instilled over the \nyears, do not get diluted. The DSWD has designed a special \u201cEnhanced FDS module\u201d to assist \nthe 4Ps households to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Infographics are being disseminated \nthrough social media to reiterate the need for basic hygiene and social distancing, backyard \ngardening  to  supplement  household  nutrition,  responsible  use  of  the  CCT  as  well  as  the \nunconditional emergency cash assistance to safeguard health and other critical expenses, and \ncoping with mental trauma. ADB will provide TA support to help DSWD develop these initiatives \n \n33 Assessment of Family Development Sessions and Youth Development Sessions (Summary) (accessible from the \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 The four foundational graduation pillars include social protection to provide immediate relief for basic needs, social \nempowerment to promote inclusion and behavioral change, financial inclusion to provide income management and \nincrease savings, and localized livelihood promotion to develop productive income-generating activities. \n ", "9 \nfurther so that after the quarantines are progressively lifted, the FDSs can continue to build the \nawareness and capacity of the 4Ps households to deal with the long-term effects of COVID-19 \nwithout compromising the health and education of their members, especially of the children. The \nproposed support for the update of Listahanan 3, IT reforms, and FINTECH solutions under ESAP \nwill improve targeting, automate aspects of compliance verification (thereby, reducing the need \nfor physical contact), and increase the speed and accuracy of the grants payments, which will be \neven more relevant in the post-COVID-19 environment.   \n \n21.  Integrated solutions. While the 4Ps has been effective in improving education and health \nof 4Ps households, the long-term impact on human capital development depends on access to \nschools and health facilities, and on the quality of teachers, health staff, and facilities. These \naspects fall under the purview of DepEd, the DOH, and the DILG. While the ESAP will focus only \non the DSWD, ADB\u2019s other ongoing support for secondary education and proposed support to \nimplement the Universal Health Care Act of the Philippines will help improve the supply side and \nreinforce the positive effects of 4Ps\u2019 demand-side interventions.35 ADB will tap synergies across \nits interventions to meet the multidimensional challenges of human capital development and \npoverty reduction, as emphasized in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The  4Ps  is  estimated  to  cost  $8,306.6  million  from  2020  to  2023  (Table  2).  The \ngovernment will finance $7,506.6 million or 90.4% of the total to cover cash grants, salaries, \ncapacity  building,  training,  social  marketing  and  advocacy,  recurrent  costs,  bank  fees, \nadministrative costs, and monitoring and evaluation, including spot checks. The World Bank has \nprovided a loan of $300 million as additional financing to its ongoing Second Social Welfare \nDevelopment Reform Project, covering the period 2020-2022. \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The DSWD\u2019s Fund Category 101: Social Protection Support Program includes rice subsidies and \nCCTs. Of the $7.611 billion projected transfers to 4Ps households from January 2020 to December 2023, 31.3% will \nbe for rice subsidies and 68.7% for education and health CCTs. The entire project loan of $500 million will be used \nto finance CCTs for education and health, representing, on average, about 9.56% of government spending on CCTs \nfrom January 2020 to December 2023. Actual disbursement by ADB in any single year may be more or less than \n9.56%, depending on the government\u2019s borrowing requirements with respect to CCTs.

The  DSWD\u2019s \nExecutive Committee, chaired by the secretary, will have oversight responsibility for the 4Ps and \nthe project. The NPMO of the 4Ps will execute all policies, plans, and activities. An undersecretary \nwill serve as the national project director and be responsible for guiding project implementation. \nThe assistant secretary of operations for specialized programs will serve as the deputy national \nproject  director  of  4Ps.  A  full-time  national  program  manager  will  manage  the  day-to-day \noperations of the NPMO, with the support of a deputy program manager for operations and a \ndeputy program manager.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) analysis was undertaken to assess the \neconomic viability of the 4Ps, which will be supported by the ESAP.36 The analysis draws on \nestimates of the third impact evaluation of the 4Ps and is based on quantifiable benefits arising \nfrom the 19% increase in enrollment seen for children who are 16\u201317 years old. The increased \nenrollment is expected to help more 4Ps children to complete senior high school, thereby raising \ntheir labor productivity and wages. Benefits such as improved health and nutrition, community \nengagement through FDS, and better socioemotional skills are significant but difficult to quantify. \nThus, the EIRR calculated is a lower bound of 4Ps benefits. The economic analysis excludes \nCCTs since they are transfer payments, and hence, not considered as economic costs. It treats \n4Ps incremental operational costs, assumed at 8% of total grants based on the DSWD\u2019s budget \nestimates, as economic costs. For grantees, the costs include opportunity cost of not working \nwhile studying in senior high school, based on estimated wages foregone. The benefits of \nincreased school enrollment and completion are based on econometric analysis of the association \nbetween wages and the level of schooling using labor force survey data, while controlling for \nsample selection bias.37 The EIRR is 9.8%, and the economic net present value is $419.1 million. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return is robust to variations in the assumptions. \nLowering the high school enrollment rate for beneficiaries from 88% to 80% (i.e., cutting the \nenrollment effect of the program nearly in half) decreases the EIRR to 6.8%, while increasing it to \n95% raises the EIRR to 11.1%. Doubling the operational cost reduces the EIRR to 6.3%, while \nhalving it raises the EIRR to 12.5%. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Spending on the 4Ps grew from 0.57% of the government\u2019s expenditure in 2009 to 2.39% \nin 2019. In real terms, spending expanded eleven-fold. The ratio of national government debt to \nGDP fell from 52.4% in 2010 to 38.9% in 2019. Recent projections reflecting the impact of COVID-\n19 show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be 41.5% in 2020 before eventually falling to \n39.6% by 2024. Thus, there is reasonable fiscal space to finance the 4Ps program despite the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The 4Ps is estimated to cost about $8,306.6 million from 2020 to 2023. The \ngovernment  will  finance  $7,506.6  million  or  90.4%.38  Its  commitment  to  the  program  is \n \n36 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Rates of Return to Education in the Philippines (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 Economic and Financial Analysis; and Philippines: Public Expenditure on Social Protection and Policy Reforms for \nConvergence (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nunderscored by the enactment of the 4Ps law, which which effectively institutionalizes the \nprogram and guarantees adequate annual budget allocation. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The government continues to strengthen its public financial management. Significant \nimprovement in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment of 2016 were \nnoted in areas of transparency of budgeting, accounting, and reporting.39 However, budget \nreliability and aggregate expenditure outturn have been below par, with obligations falling short \nof appropriations. Weak internal controls\u2014updating of records, tracking of compliance, quality of \ninternal audit, and lack of automation\u2014create risk of funds misuse. Overall performance is \nassessed as weak, and associated fiduciary risks rated substantial.40 \n \n29.  At the 4Ps level, the pre-mitigation financial management risk is rated substantial. The \nCommission on Audit issues annual audit opinions on the 4Ps. Most, if not all, observations are \nresolved within the fiscal year.41 A consistent audit observation is the delay in liquidation of cash, \ncaused mainly by the shift to cash cards, delays in replacement of cash cards, and changes in \nthe addresses of some households. The unliquidated funds remain with the LBP. The DSWD has \na good financial management system, with strong internal controls. It has extensive experience \nundertaking large programs and working with multiple development partners. Its overall obligation \nrate averaged 87.5% in 2011\u20132018. ADB is providing technical assistance to further strengthen \nthe DSWD\u2019s financial management system. With this support, the risk is moderate. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government  and  the  DSWD.  The specific policy  requirements  and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.42 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The key causes of poverty in the Philippines include high rates of inequality of income and \nopportunities, underinvestment in physical and human capital, and adverse impacts of frequent \nnatural hazards. Poor families lack adequate access to essential social services, including \neducation  and  health,  which  lowers  their  investment  in  human  capital  and  exacerbates \nintergenerational transmission of poverty. Therefore, the government expanded the coverage of \nthe 4Ps to nearly 4.4 million poor households between 2008\u20132019. The ESAP will support the \n4Ps and help break the intergenerational transfer of poverty by financing a portion of the CCT. In \nremote areas where most indigenous people live, the 4Ps conditionalities and support packages \nhave been modified to better reflect people\u2019s cultural preferences, practices, and needs. The \nESAP will act as a cushion against the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has \nexacerbated the plight of the poor.  \n \n32.  The ESAP has a gender equity theme. It will use a gender mainstreaming strategy to \nempower women and transform gender relations within households. Key gender issues that will \nbe addressed under the project include (i) low reporting of new pregnancies or births from \nsucceeding pregnancies; (ii) non compliance with conditions due to gender-based violence and \nchild protection issues such as early pregnancy, early cohabitation, neglect/abandonment, rape, \n  \u2010\n39 Government of the Philippines and Development Partners. 2016.

The ESAP will (i) support women and children beneficiaries who \nare  non-compliant  due  to  gender-based  violence  and  child  protection  cases;  (ii)  provide \nladderized gender capacity building for the DSWD staff and program implementers, and gender-\nresponsive FDS and YDS for beneficiary households; (iii) improve reporting of succeeding \npregnancies to monitor mother\u2019s health benefits; (iv) support women with gendered-vulnerabilities \nby  linking  services  through  referral  mechanisms  for  complementary  interventions;  and  (v) \nrecognize gender advocate families. The 4Ps\u2019 gender guidelines detail the entry points and \nstrategies to mainstream gender in every component. The Gender Action Plan also integrates \nspecific  needs  and  concerns  of  indigenous  women,  including  developing  appropriate  IEC \nmaterials for FDS modules that use socially inclusive images and gender-fair language.43  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguards \ncategories are as follows: \n \n34.  Environment (category C). No civil works or other activity with potential for adverse \nenvironmental impacts will be supported under the project. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No land will be acquired under the project. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The project will have a positive impact on indigenous \nhouseholds by providing them with additional cash income to improve their children\u2019s education, \nhealth, and nutrition, as well as raise awareness of their rights and of government development \nprograms. The 4Ps has always had a strong focus on indigenous people. As of 29 February 2020, \n643,414 indigenous households (15.0% of total active households) are covered under 4Ps. Of \nthese households, 72.6% are from Mindanao, 24.75% from Luzon, and 2.7% from Visayas. \nAround 69.6% of these households are headed by female grantees. The ESAP will employ \nculturally appropriate and gender-sensitive consultation processes when engaging with tribal \nleaders,  indigenous communities,  and  indigenous  peoples\u2019  representatives. The  indigenous \npeoples plan specifies safeguard provisions to be monitored during project implementation to \nensure  that  benefits  are  equally  distributed.44  The  indigenous  peoples  plan  also  provides \nguidance for culturally appropriate program implementation for indigenous beneficiaries.  \n \nF.
