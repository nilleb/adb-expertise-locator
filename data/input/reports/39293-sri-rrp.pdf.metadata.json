It  helps  increase  equity  of \naccess  to  quality  teaching  and  learning  by  upgrading  one \nprovincially  administered  secondary  school  in  each  of  the  150 \npoorest  administrative  divisions.  The  upgraded  schools  will  offer \nadvanced  level  science  streams,  and  teaching  in  key  subjects \nsuch as information and communication technology (ICT), English \nand technical subjects.  \n\n(CBE) \n\nthrough \n\nin  English  Education  (CEIEE). \n\nThe Project will support Government reform in competency-based \nthe  development  of  curriculum, \neducation \ninstructional  materials,  performance  standards  and \nteacher \ntraining.  It  will  continue  supporting  mainstreaming  of  School-\nBased  Assessment  (SBA).  It  will  help  improve  the  quality  of \nEnglish  teaching  by  supporting  the  establishment  of  a  Center  of \nExcellence \nIt  will  continue \nsupporting the expansion of ICT education and the use of ICT in \nlearning. The Project will upgrade Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced \nTechnological  Education  (SLIATE)  institutions  into  more  market-\nresponsive  tertiary  education  providers.  It  will  promote  a  senior-\nlevel  inter-agency  policy  dialogue  to  strengthen  linkages  and \npartnerships  between  general  and  tertiary  education,  technical \neducation and vocational training (TEVT), and the private  sector. \nGovernance  and  service  delivery  will  improve  through  education \nmanagement  and  leadership  training  programs,  development  of \nan  integrated  management  information  system,  strengthened \ncareer  guidance,  and  social  marketing  programs  to  support  the \nchange  of  prevailing  attitudes  and  bias  to  university  degree \nadmission  as  the  only  option  for  secondary  school  students.  In \naddition, \nimmunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  health \neducation.  \n \n\nthe  Project  will  support  human \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  education  system  needs  to  adjust  to  the  changing  needs  of \nthe  modern  economy.  The  school  system  is  oriented  toward \nconventional  university  education  and  does  not  teach  skills  and \nattitudes that  are  relevant  to  labor market  needs.  Intake  capacity \nof  tertiary  education,  including  TEVT  is  still  limited.  As  a  result, \nmost young school leavers lack the necessary competencies to fit \ninto  the  workplace.  Many  unemployed  are  educated  youth. \nTherefore, there is a need to improve the quality and relevance of \nsecondary  education,  and  to  broaden  learning  options  at  tertiary \nlevel. Introducing CBE, and strengthening teaching of science and \ntechnology,  English,  technical  subjects  and  ICT  will  increase \nskills-based  competitiveness \nin  areas  of  high  demand: \nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors.  Strengthening  career \nguidance  and  social  marketing  programs  to  orient  students \ntowards  wider \nincluding  non-\ntertiary  education  options, \nconventional  tertiary  programs  and  TEVT  will  help  broaden \nlearning options and career paths for educated youth.      \n \nRegional disparities are acute in access to sciences, English, ICT, \nand  technical  subjects.  The  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  and \nthe plantation areas particularly lack resources. Increasing equity \nof access to quality education irrespective of regions, gender and \nethnic groups is a key priority of the Government.    \n \nAlthough  Sri  Lanka  has  low  prevalence  of  HIV  infection,  lack  of \nawareness of the risk of infectious diseases increase the country\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  an  epidemic.  Successful  prevention  and  control \nwould  depend  on  the  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  of \nadolescents  and  youth.  This  calls  for  expanded  access  to \ninformation and education for a healthy life.  \n \nThe expected impact of the Project is the increased relevance of \nsecondary  and  tertiary  education  to  labor  market  requirements, \nwhich will lead to increased employability of educated youth. The \nexpected  outcome  of \nimproved  quality, \nrelevance,  effectiveness,  and  equity  of  access  to  secondary  and \ntertiary education. \n \nThe total investment cost is estimated at $105.3 million including \ntaxes and duties of $8.0 million. \n \nThe Government has requested a loan of $65.0 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and an ADF grant of $15.0 \nmillion  equivalent  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  ADB  loan  and \ngrant  will  finance  76%  of  the  project  cost.  The  Government  is  to \nprovide  $25.3  million  equivalent,  or 24%  of  the total  project  cost, \nto  cover  (i)  40%  of  civil  work  cost;  (ii)  29%  of  local  training  cost; \n(iii)  100%  of  the  loan  project  cost  on  office  overhead  and \noperation, operation and maintenance of project facilities including \nvehicles,  computers,  equipment,  and  furniture;  and  (iv)  all  the \ntaxes and duties. \n\nthe  Project \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n\n \n\niii \n\n \nThe loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years.  The  loan  will  carry  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during \nthe  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n \nIn addition, the Government has requested a grant of $15.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ADF resources to help finance a scholarship program, \nan  Initiative  for  Innovative  ICT  for  Learning  (IIIL),  and  the \nHIV/AIDS health education component. \n \n30 June 2013 \n \n31 December 2012  \n\nof \n\n \nMinistry of Education (MOE)  \n \nThe  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  of  the  ongoing  Secondary \nEducation Modernization Project II (SEMP II) will be enlarged and \nserve as the PSC of the Project. It will direct the Project, monitor \nits  activities  and  outputs,  guide  the  Project  Management  Office \n(PMO),  and  coordinate  with  other  government  agencies  and \ndepartments.  The  Secretary  of  MOE  will  chair  the  PSC,  whose \nmembers  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Higher \nEducation,  Ministry  of  Vocational  and  Technical  Training,  MOE, \nFinance  Commission,  External  Resources  Department  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  Department,  National \nInstitute  of  Education,  National  Education  Testing  Services, \nprovincial  ministries \neducation,  National  Education \nCommission,  Ministry  of  Health,  and  Federation  of  Chambers  of \nCommerce  and  Industry,  as  well  as  one  Provincial  Director  of \nEducation  on  a  rotating  basis.  To  ensure  complementarity  with \nSEMP  II,  the  same  PMO  will  take  responsibility  of  managing  the \nProject, with additional staff.   \n \nin \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Each contract for goods and services \nof  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  contract \npackages  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  National \nCompetitive  Bidding  (NCB).  All  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nawarded \nthe  commencement  of  any \nprocurement  activity  under  NCB,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will \nreview the Borrower\u2019s procurement law to ensure consistency with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Minor  items  valued  at  less  than \n$10,000 equivalent will be procured directly following Government \nprocedures.  \n \n\nthrough  NCB.  Before \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nA  team  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  provide  services  in  a \nrange of specializations, with estimated international inputs of 69 \nperson-months  and  national  inputs  of  300  person-months  under \nthe  loan,  and  15  person-months  of  international  inputs  and  54 \nperson-months of national inputs under the grant. The consultants \nwill  be  engaged  through  firms  using  the  quality-and  cost-based \nselection  method.  The  quality-cost \nratio  will  be  80:20. \nApproximately  3  international  and  4  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged through individual recruitment. \n \nThe Project will benefit primary and secondary school students in \nthe  150  poorest  administrative  divisions.  The  upgraded  schools \nwill provide them with quality teaching in key subjects of sciences, \nEnglish, ICT, and technical subjects. This will widen their options \nfor  tertiary  education,  and  ultimately  their  career  path.  Reform  in \nCBE  will  make  education  more  outcomes-based,  thus  more \npractical.  Expansion  of  SBA  will  make  assessment  more \ncomprehensive  and  less  centered  on  national  examination. \nStrengthened  use  of  ICT  for  learning  will  diversify  and  enrich \nteaching and learning. Enhanced linkages with industry will make \nstudents understand the world of work. Capacity enhancement of \nprincipals and education administrators will improve management \nefficiency.  Upgrading  of  SLIATE  will  expand  tertiary  education \nopportunities  in  all  provinces.  Education  partnerships  will  have  a \npositive  institutional  impact.  It  will  help  the  system  to  become \nmore  responsive  to  diversified  needs,  secure  more  resources  to \neducation, and to have a holistic view of the education sector. All \nProject  interventions  will  contribute  to  the  knowledge-based \nsociety which the Government envisions.   \n \nAs  the  proportion  of  schools  to  benefit  from  Project  interventions \nwill follow the School Census Data, equity among Sinhala, Tamil, \nand  Muslim  students  will  be  ensured.  An  affirmative  action  to \naddress  weakness  in  English  teaching  in  Tamil  schools  will \nespecially  benefit  Tamil  medium  students.  Expansion  of  tertiary \neducation opportunities through SLIATE will also allow access to \nhigher  skills  by  poor  students  from  all  ethnic  groups,  leading  to \nbetter jobs in both local and foreign markets.  \n \n\n\fv \n\nThe Project will ensure that all target beneficiaries gain access to \nresources provided by the Project irrespective of gender, ethnicity, \nand  geographic  location.  However,  security  concerns  may  affect \nproject  activities  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  The  Project  will \nbuild  maximum  flexibility  in  its  implementation.  For  instance,  for \nthe upgrading of secondary schools, if in any given year selected \nschools  from  the  Northern  Province  cannot  be  upgraded  due  to \nsecurity concerns, those schools will be replaced in that year with \nschools  from  another  province,  but  the  overall  project  quota  for \nschools  to  be  upgraded  from  Northern  Province  will  not  change. \nFurthermore,  reallocation  of  funds  among  schools  within  the \nNorthern  Province  will  be  agreed  between  MOE  and  ADB. \nRefurbishment  of  schools  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  will  only \ntake place with the assurances of a return to peace and security. \nClose  monitoring  of  security  conditions  will  mitigate  risks.  The \nstatus of project implementation in the conflict-affected areas will \nbe  assessed  periodically  and  adjustment  will  be  made  in  project \nscope or implementation arrangements as necessary. The Project \nwill not cause displacement of any families or households as civil \nworks are limited to existing school property and the renovation of \nexisting  buildings.  In  the  event  that  land  acquisition  is  required, \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) will be followed. No \nadverse  environment  impact  is  anticipated.  Civil  works  will  follow \ncountry  specific  environmental  guidelines  and \nthe  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Disposal of hazardous chemicals that \nmay  be  used  during  science  classes  will  be  consistent  with  the \nhandling  and  safe  disposal  measures  already  employed  in  the \nsecondary schools in the country. \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f80  00'Eo\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nS R I   L A N K A\nEDUCATION FOR KNOWLEDGE\nSOCIETY PROJECT\n\nP a l k     S t r a i t\n\nJaffna\n\nKankasanturai\n\nKodikamam\n\nP a l k     B a y\n\nKilinochchi\n\nMullaittivu\n\nTanniyuttu\n\nNational Capital\n\nChief Provincial Town\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\n9  00'No\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n9  00'No\n\nTalaimannar\n\nMannar\n\nG u l f   o f   M a n n a r\n\nMankulam\n\nN O R T H E R N\nPuliyankulam\n\nVavuniya\n\nHorowupotana\n\nTrincomalee\n\nAnuradhapura\n\nN O R T H  C E N T R A L\n\nTambuttegama\n\nKekirawa\n\nPuttalam\n\nB a y     o f     B e n g a l\n\nPolonnaruwa\n\nDambulla\n\nWelikanda\n\nValaichchenai\n\nE A S T E R N\n\nBatticaloa\n\nChilaw\n\nMadampe\n\nN O R T H\nW E S T E R N\n\nKurunegala\n\nPolgahawela\n\nNegombo\n\nWarakapola\n\nMinuwangoda\n\nKegalle\n\nMawanella\n\nMatale\nC E N T R A L\n\nKandy\n\nGampola\n\n7  00'No\n\nGampaha\n\nColombo\n\nAvissawella\n\nTalawakele\n\nNuwara Eliya\n\nBadulla\n\nWelimada\n\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE\n\nMoratuwa\n\nWESTERN\n\nHatton\n\nMonaragala\n\nU V A\n\nBandarawela\n\nRatnapura\n\nWellawaya\n\nKalutara\n\nAlutgama\n\nBalangoda\nPelmadulla\nS A B A R A G A M U WA\n\nAmpara\n\n7  00'No\n\nElpitiya\n\nAmbalangoda\n\nHikkaduwa\n\nAkuressa\n\nS O U T H E R N\n\nHambantota\n\nN\n\nGalle\n\nMatara\n\nTangalle\n\n80  00'Eo\n\no\n81  30'E\n\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n\n0\n\n10 20 30 40 50\n\nKilometers\n\n07-3077 RM\n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education \nfor Knowledge Society Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nSri  Lanka  has  achieved  universal  primary  education,  high  literacy  rates,  and  gender \nequity in basic education. In 2006, the completion rate at junior secondary level reached 84%.  \nPerformance  at  senior  secondary  level  has  significantly  improved  since  2001  as  result  of \nGovernment\u2019s efforts and external support such as that of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nBetween 2001 and 2006, the General Certificate ordinary level (O level) examination pass rate \nincreased from 37% to 49%, and the General Certificate advanced level (A level) examination \npass rate increased from 50% to 60%. Pass rates in science, mathematics and English remain \nlower  than  the  average,  thus  further  improvement  is  needed.  Students  who  fail  the  O  level \nexamination  repeat  the  test.  Those  who  passed  O  level  generally  continue  to  A  level.  A  level \ngraduates  compete  for  university  and  other  tertiary  education  institutions,  but  the  system  has \nsuch  limited  intake  capacity  that  only  about  11%  of  those  who  qualify  are  admitted  to  tertiary \neducation  institutions.  Others  enroll  in  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (TEVT) \nprograms.  With  ADB  support,  quality  and  relevance  of  TEVT  programs  have  improved,  but \noptions  for  higher  skills  upgrade  are  still  limited.  Overall,  performance  at  secondary  level  has \nimproved,  but  bottlenecks  entering  tertiary  level  institutions,  including  TEVT  undermine  the \nachievement and efficiency gained in primary level.  \n \n3. \nUnemployment in Sri Lanka declined from 8.8% in 2002 to 6.6% in 2006. However, the \nunemployment rates among O level and A level graduates were 12% and 14%, respectively. Of \nthe total unemployed, 44% were below O level, 28% were O level graduates and another 28% \nwere A level graduates while 55% of the unemployed were below 29 years old. These figures \nshow that many unemployed are educated youth. This is partly due to lack of job opportunities \nbut  also  largely  due  to  the  mismatch  between  the  supply  from  the  education  system  and  the \ndemands  of  the  labor  market.  Thus,  Sri  Lanka  needs  to  increase  both  internal  and  external \nefficiency of its education system, if the sector is to play a key role in national economic growth. \nA sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n  \nB. \n \n4. \nLabor  Market  Conditions  and  Demand.  The  labor  market  has  undergone  significant \nchanges  since  1990:  employment  in  agriculture  has  decreased  while  employment  in  the \nmanufacturing  and  services  sectors  has  increased.  Employment  in  foreign  countries  through \nremittances  from  expatriate  workers  has  become  a  key  component  of  the  economy.  Labor \nmarket  data  and  projections  show  an  increasing  demand  for  skilled  and  semi-skilled  labor  in \ntechnology  (ICT)  and  other \nconstruction,  health  care, \nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors  in  local  and  foreign  markets.  If  a  favorable  political  and \neconomical  environment  can  promote  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  development, \nproductive and skill-intensive formal and informal sector employment will also expand.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\ninformation  and  communication \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.

As  a \nproductive and competitive economy, it will require high level skills in specific fields as well as \nincreasing  diversified  and  updated  skills.  To  meet  such  future  demand,  quality  and  relevant \nsecondary  and  tertiary  education,  including  TEVT,  need  to  expand.  More  flexible  and  broader \nlearning options at each education level should be made available. As such, ministries involved \nin  education  can  no  longer  finance  and  provide  education  alone;  neither  can  the  education \nsystem  work  in  isolation  from  other  sectors.  A  key  sector  challenge  is  to  build  effective \npartnerships  among  multiple  governmental,  private,  and  community  stakeholders  to  make \neducation more responsive to the needs of the economy.  \n     \nReorienting  the  School  System.  The  school  system  has  traditionally  focused  on \n6. \nscreening and selection for conventional university education. As a consequence, students lack \npractical  and  generic  skills  and  attitudes  that  are  needed  in  the  labor  market,  such  as \ncommunications,  team  work,  problem  solving,  and  critical  thinking.  Career  guidance  is  weak. \nAlthough  only  a  few  students  can  enroll  in  university,  parents  and  students  have  a  traditional \npreference for university degree admission as the only option for higher skills upgrade. As the \neconomy becomes more dynamic, education must become more practical and relevant to labor \nmarket needs. Thus, the school system needs to prepare and orient students to wider learning \noptions  and  career  paths,  including  non-university  tertiary  education  and  TEVT  programs. \nEducation  content  and  teaching  methodologies  should  become  more  competency  based,  life \noriented, and applied to current and future labor market needs.  \n \nEquity of Access to Key Study Areas. Another key challenge is to increase the equity \n7. \nof access to quality teaching and learning. Although science streams have better employment \nprospects,  many  A  level  students  opt  for  art  streams.  This  is  because  of  the  lack  of  science \nteachers and laboratories, especially in rural areas. Out of 2,300 senior secondary schools, still \nonly  about  700  provide  teaching  in  A  level  science.  Access  to  ICT  in  education  has  gradually \nexpanded  since  2001,  however  it  is  still  limited  to  large  schools  in  urban  areas.  As  such, \nregional disparities in access to quality education persist, with the unequal distribution of school \nfacilities,  teachers,  and  teaching-learning  resources.  As  a  consequence,  large,  well  equipped \nurban schools are overcrowded, while poorly equipped schools in remote areas are in decline. \nConflict-affected  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces  and  resource-starved  rural  and  plantation \nareas particularly suffer. The shortage of teachers in science, mathematics, and English is acute \nin  the  rural  areas,  in  both  Sinhala  and  Tamil  language  schools.  Gender  stereotypes  affect  girl \nstudents opting for science and technology fields. Ultimately, children from disadvantaged areas \nhave little chance of breaking the poverty cycle by getting into schools leading to better career \nprospects.  Continuous  efforts  are  needed  to  upgrade  schools  in  rural  areas  and  to  promote \nequitable deployment of teachers across regions and medium of instruction. Specific attention is \nrequired to support education in the conflict-affected areas to ensure that children in those areas \nare not excluded from the benefits of modern knowledge and technologies. \n \nManagement  Efficiency.  In  part  due  to  a  policy  of  decentralization,2  different  policies, \n8. \nprocedures, and resource management systems coexist between national schools administered \nat the central level and provincial schools administered at the provincial level. Such dual system \nand inadequate management capacities at various levels of administration impede the efficiency \nof  education  governance.  School-based  management  has  been  introduced  to  improve  school \ngovernance  and  quality  of  teaching  through  bottom-up  planning  and  resources  management. \n\n                                                 \n2 In 1987, the Government devolved education management to the nine provinces (see Appendix 2).    \n\n\f3 \n\nHowever, further strengthening of managerial capacity and professional development of school \nprincipals  and  education  officers  at  all  levels  are  needed  to  improve  management  efficiency. \nFurthermore, streamlining and modernizing administrative systems by introducing an integrated \nmanagement information system will help rationalize operational procedures at all levels.  \n \n9. \nTertiary  Education  and  Education  Finance. Better  performance  and  more  graduates \nat  the  secondary  level  lead  to  increasing  demand  for  education  at  the  tertiary  level.  However, \npublic  resource  constraints  limit  the  expansion  and  modernization  of  tertiary  education.  Sri \nLanka has a relatively low public expenditure on education, which is 3% of its gross domestic \nproduct and about 9% of total government expenditure in 2007. Moreover, education is free up \nto the university first degree level, thus it relies heavily on public resources. With Government \nbudget  constraints,  access,  quality,  and  relevance  of  education  cannot  be  maintained  or \nenhanced without cost recovery measures and greater private sector involvement. However, the \ncurrent political environment does not favor establishment of private universities, or the concept \nof cost recovery in the university system. Therefore, tertiary education institutions outside of the \nuniversity system, including postsecondary TEVT programs, will play a greater role in providing \nhigher skills upgrade opportunities. Non-conventional institutions such as the Sri Lanka Institute \nfor  Advanced  Technological  Education  (SLIATE),  award  National  Diploma  (ND)  and  High \nNational Diploma (HND) level qualifications for mid-level engineering and business professions. \nWhile an overarching policy on tertiary education and revised regulatory frameworks are needed \nfor  long-term  reforms,  a  key  medium-term  strategy  is  to  strengthen  capacity  of  existing \ninstitutions such as SLIATE to meet immediate demands.  \n \n10. \nHIV/AIDS  and  Health  Education.  Although  Sri  Lanka  has  a  low  prevalence  of  HIV \ninfection,  lack  of  awareness  of  the  risk  of  infectious  diseases  increases  the  country\u2019s \nvulnerability to an epidemic. Successful prevention and control would depend on the knowledge, \nattitudes, and practices of adolescents and youth. This calls for expanded access to information \nand education for a healthy life. Schools are well placed to address this need. To reap the full \nbenefit  of  the  investment  in  education,  those  who  pass  through  the  system  must  acquire \nsufficient well-rounded knowledge and skills to remain healthy and productive throughout their \nlifetime.  \n \nGovernment Strategy. The Government\u2019s ten year development plan (2006\u20132015) calls \n11. \nfor an education system that will provide the technological skills required for a knowledge-based \nsociety  to  underpin  rapid  economic  and  social  development.  Key  Government  strategies  in \ngeneral  education3  are  to:  (i)  introduce  competency-based  education  (CBE)  at  the  secondary \nlevel  to  make  education  more  life-skills  oriented;  (ii)  strengthen  teaching  in  ICT,  languages \nincluding English, sciences, and technical subjects; (iii) upgrade one secondary school in each \nof the 325 administrative divisions to full-fledged schools to enhance equitable access to quality \neducation  nationwide;  (iv)  delineate  primary  schools  (grades  1\u20135)  from  secondary  schools \n(grades  6\u201313)  for  better  rationalization;  (v)  strengthen  the  linkage  between  general  education, \ntertiary education, and TEVT; (vi) introduce school-based teacher appointment as a measure to \nensure equitable distribution of teachers; and (vii) strengthen public-private partnerships (PPP) \nin selected fields.  \n \n12. \nHarmonized Sector Assistance. The Government has developed an Education Sector \nDevelopment  Framework  and  Program  (ESDFP)  2006\u20132010  that  provides  a  policy  framework \nand guide for development assistance in general education. The ESDFP calls for a harmonized \napproach to external assistance in general education. External assistance is integrated into the \n\n                                                 \n3   General education in this context means school education from grades 1 to 13.  \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nESDFP  under  the  leadership  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE).  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank  provide  the  largest  assistance  through \nproject  investments  and  budgetary  support.  Bilateral  agencies  have  been  active  in  education \nprograms for peace building, school improvement, TEVT, and rehabilitation in the Northern and \nEastern Provinces and tsunami-affected areas. External assistance is described in Appendix 3. \n \n13. \nADB Strategy and its Outcomes. Consistent with Government priorities, ADB\u2019s sector \nstrategy  for  Sri  Lanka4  focuses  on  raising  the  quality  and  relevance  of  education,  increasing \nequity  of  access,  and  enhancing  employability  of  graduates.  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  policy5 \ncalls  for  more  investment  in  post-basic  and  tertiary  education,  including  TEVT,  to  support  the \ntransformation to a high-technology and service-oriented economy. In line with the sector policy \nand  strategy,  ADB  is  investing  in  several  spheres  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  secondary  and  tertiary \neducation,  including  TEVT,  between  2000  and  2010.6  The  earlier  Secondary  Education \nModernization  Project  (SEMP)  and  the  ongoing  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project  II \n(SEMP  II)  have  initiated  support  for  modernizing  secondary  education,  and  teaching  and \nlearning  methods,  through  curriculum  revision  and  enhanced  use  of  ICT  in  learning,  science \nteaching, and reform in school-based assessment (SBA). SEMP II further supports devolution of \neducation  management  through  school-based  management  and  training  in  teaching  and \nlearning  at  zonal  level.  At  the  tertiary  level,  the  Distance  Education  Modernization  Project \n(DEMP)  supports  the  expansion  of  tertiary  education  opportunities  through  enhanced  use  of \ndistance education for service delivery, PPP in distance education, and capacity upgrade of the \nOpen  University  of  Sri  Lanka  (OUSL).  The  Technical  Education  Development  Project  (TEDP) \nsupports  further  upgrading  of  technical  colleges  and  expansion  of  post-A  level  technical \neducation through a new University of Vocational Technology.     \n \nFindings  of  the  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  (CAPE)7  show  that  education \n14. \nsector  assistance  is  relevant,  efficient,  effective,  and  likely  to  be  sustainable.  Outcomes  in \nsecondary  education  are:  (i)  improved  pass  rates  over  the  period  2001\u20132006  (para.  2);  (ii) \nrelatively  high  entry  to  A  level  (73%)  and  university  (58%)  for  scholarship  recipients  under \nSEMP; (iii) higher access to senior secondary level by economically disadvantaged children; (iv) \naccess to ICT in school initiated through 1,000 computer learning centers and school networks, \nand teaching of General Information Technology at O and A level; (v) wider recognition of SBA \nas  part  of  the  national  assessment;  and  (vi)  strengthened  capacity  of  the  National  Evaluation \nand Testing Service (NETS). In tertiary education, a 72% employment rate of graduates of ADB- \nassisted Science and Technology institutions was achieved in 2002. Outcomes in TEVT include: \n(i)  higher  job  relevance  and  self-employment  rates  of  TVET  graduates;  (ii)  an  institutionalized \ncompetency-based training system; and (iii) establishment of a National Vocational Qualification \nsystem that offers a career path and alternative avenue to higher education. \n \n15. \nLessons.  Besides  initial  positive  sector  outcomes,  lessons  were  identified  for  further \nsystem  improvement:  (i)  because  the  scope  of  individual  projects  is  limited,  continuous  and \n                                                 \n4   ADB.2003.

Cost-recovery \n\ncomplementary  investments  within  an  overall  sector  assistance  framework  are  needed  to \nmaximize  project  outputs  and  accelerate  progress  in  sector  outcomes;  and  (ii)  the  CAPE  and \nother  studies  further  demonstrate  that  support  to  implement  major  policy  reforms  needs  to \ncarefully  consider \nin  education,  PPP, \ndecentralization,  teacher  deployment,  and  school  rationalization  are  complex  policy  areas  that \nrequire strong and stable political leadership, wider public acceptance, and stronger stakeholder \ncapacity.  Long-term  project  assistance  to  reform  processes  through  building  best  practices, \ncontinuous  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  enhancement  will  be  more  effective  than  ambitious \npolicy-based lending.   \n \n16. \nThe proposed Project builds upon past project outcomes and complements the ongoing \nprojects  in  secondary  and  tertiary  education.  The  ESDFP  appropriately  addresses  the  key \nissues in general education. Its themes of equity, quality, efficiency, and good governance are \nconsistent with ADB sector strategies. Therefore, the Project will be integrated into the ESDFP \nand  support  implementation  of  Government  strategies  in  specific  areas.  The  Project  also \nincorporates  support  in  key  policy  reform  areas,  such  as  innovations  for  PPP,  capacity \ndevelopment  in  education  leadership  and  management,  and  a  mechanism  for  inter-agency \npolicy dialogue between general education, tertiary education, TEVT, and the private sector. A \nsummary of ADB assistance in the sector in relation to the Project is in Appendix 4.               \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe expected impact of the Project is the increased relevance of secondary and tertiary \n17. \neducation to labor market requirements, leading to increased employability of educated youth. \nThe  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is  the  improved  quality,  relevance,  effectiveness,  and \nequity of access to secondary and tertiary education.  \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nIncreased Equity of Access to Education  \n\n \n18. \nSecondary  School  Upgrading.  This  component  will  support  the  Government  strategy \nto  upgrade  one  provincially  administered  secondary  school  to  a  full-fledged  school  in  each  of \nthe 325 administrative divisions. The Project will upgrade 150 secondary schools nationwide in \nthe poorest divisions. The selection of the divisions will follow the poverty ranking of the National \nHeadcount  Index  published  by  the  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics.  In  the  absence  of \nofficial poverty data available for the Northern Province, data from existing poverty surveys will \nbe  used  as  reference  to  select  the  divisions  in  that  province.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  specific \nchallenges  for  development  in  the  Northern  Province,  the  selection  of  the  divisions  will  also \nconsider strategic geographic and demographic areas of development potential. The provincial \nMinistries  of  Education  (PMEs)  will  finalize  the  selection  of  divisions  in  close  partnership  with \nMOE. An appropriate number of schools will be selected from the Northern Province, taking into \nconsideration the national demographic balance. The selection of schools will follow criteria that \ntake into account the regional, ethnic, and medium of instruction balance, and the  potential of \nthe school to serve a sufficient number of students in the surrounding area. To enhance social \ncohesion, priority will be given to schools that cater to a multi-ethnic student population. Schools \nthat  have  received  support  from  SEMP  II  are  eligible,  provided  that  there  is  no  duplication  of \ninputs.  The  indicative  selection  criteria  and  approval  process  for  upgraded  schools  are  in \nAppendix 5. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \n19. \nA  Cabinet  memorandum  specifies  that  primary  school  (grades  1\u20135)  will  be  phased  out \nfrom the upgraded schools. Children starting grade 1 will attend a primary school close to their \nhomes. These primary schools will be the feeder schools to the upgraded secondary schools in \nthe surrounding area. The selected schools will have multi-purpose teaching facilities, including \nICT facilities with internet connectivity to support CBE teaching methods, particularly in science, \nmathematics  and  technical  subjects  including  ICT,  in  grades  10\u201313.  A-level  commerce  and \nscience streams will be offered. In schools with a multi-ethnic student population, instruction will \nbe  provided  in  the  two  official  languages  and  English.  Project  inputs  include  civil  works, \nprovision of equipment, furnishings, and instructional materials. Teacher quarters, water supply, \nand  electricity  will  be  provided  as  required.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  an  adequate \nnumber of qualified teachers and a competent principal will be appointed for each school. It will \nalso provide an incentive package for teachers to compensate for serving in remote areas.  \n \n20. \nScholarship  Program.  Scholarships  will  be  awarded  to  needy  children  from  poor \nfamilies  wishing  to  send  children  to  the  upgraded  schools.  Criteria  for  identifying  eligible \nstudents  and  families  will  be  established  using  household  poverty  indicators.  Eligible  students \nwill  receive  a  scholarship  of  10,000  Rupees  per  year  while  continuing  their  studies  at  the \nupgraded  schools  or  at  non-university  tertiary  level  institutions.  A  total  of  30,000  scholarships \nwill be awarded during the Project period. \n   \n\n2.  \n\nQuality and Relevance of Education Enhanced \n\n \n21. \nCBE  Curriculum  Development.  This  component  will  support  the  National  Institute  of \nEducation  (NIE)  in  the  design  and  development  of  a  CBE  curriculum,  instructional  materials, \nteaching  methodology  and  assessment  of  learner  competencies,  particularly  in  languages, \nmathematics,  sciences,  and  technical  subjects  including  ICT.  PPP  will  be  promoted  to  make \ncurriculum  more  responsive  to  student  employability.  A  quarterly  education  industry  forum  for \nCBE  development  will  be  organized.  The  curriculum  has  been  revised  for  grade  6  and  10. \nRevisions in the grade 7 and 11 curricula will be effective in January 2008, and grades 8 and 9 \nin 2009. Eight full-time staff at NIE specializing in mathematics, sciences, and technical subjects \nwill follow overseas master degree studies. Seven staff will follow master degree studies in Sri \nLanka.  One  month  of  international  training  in  current  practices  for  pedagogical  applications  of \nICT will be provided to 25 staff. Local training programs will be conducted for 60 NIE and NETS \nstaff. Consultancy services will be provided in CBE curriculum development. ICT equipment will \nbe provided to develop capacity for educational software development and for teacher training. \nEquipment  and  furnishings  for  multi-purpose  workshops  will  be  provided  to  support  teacher \ntraining  in  8  technical  subjects  including  agriculture,  information  technology,  civil,  mechanical \nand  electrical  technology,  and  automotive,  refrigeration  and  food  preservation  and  processing \ntechnology.  \n \n22. \nCompetency  Standards  for  CBE.  The  subject  syllabi  and  teacher  guides  will  provide \nteaching  methodology,  competency  standards,  and  formative  evaluation  techniques  for  CBE. \nThe  Project  will  support  NIE  and  NETS  to  develop  competency  standards  for  all  secondary \ngrades in languages, mathematics, sciences, and technical subjects, including ICT. A database \nfor  the  storage  of  the  competency  standards  will  be  established.  Preparation  of  user-friendly \ninformation  describing  the  standards  and  their  appropriate  use  will  be  developed,  and \ndistributed to teachers and education administrators. \n \n23. \nSBA  for  CBE.  The  Project  will  support  the  transition  towards  SBA.  It  will  design  and \nimplement  strategies  to  increase  SBA  practices  in  secondary  schools.  Short  term  training \n\n\f7 \n\nprograms  will  be  conducted  for  teachers  on  evaluation  of  learner  performance  in  CBE.  The \nzonal facilitators program for SBA initiated under SEMP II will be strengthened. Record keeping \nand reporting processes for improved classroom management will be introduced. National and \ninternational  professional  development  programs  will  be  provided  to  NIE  and  NETS  staff \nresponsible for CBE evaluation techniques and best practices of SBA.  \n      \n24. \nIn-Service  Teacher  Training  for  CBE.  The  Project  will  support  the  development  and \ndelivery  of  a  teacher  training  program  on  the  integration  of  ICT  in  languages,  mathematics, \nsciences,  and  technical  subjects.  18  National  Colleges  of  Education  (NCOE)  and  10  Teacher \nTraining Colleges (TTC) will develop their capacity to provide pre-service and in-service training \nprograms to TC(TC) staff and teachers. In-Service Advisers (ISA) will receive training from NIE. \nAll  institutions  will  provide  pre-service  and  in-service  training  to  teachers  from  schools  in  their \nregion.  About  360  staff  of  NCOE/TTC  and  200  TC  staff  will  be  trained  in  CBE  teaching  and \nassessment  methods  and  in  applications  of  ICT  for  teaching  and  learning.  Teacher  training  in \nCBE methods, assessment and ICT applications will then be provided to about 18,000 teachers \nthroughout Sri Lanka. NCOEs and TTCs will be provided with basic ICT equipment and media \nprojectors to facilitate the training programs. \n       \n25. \nCenter  of  Excellence  in  English  Education  (CEIEE).  The  quality  of  English  teaching \nwill improve with the development of the CEIEE in Peradeniya, which has been upgraded from a \nTTC  into  a  NCOE.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  make  it  the  headquarters  of  English \neducation  combining  several  modes  of  instructional  delivery.  CEIEE  will  develop  a  series  of \ntraining  courses  using  the  latest  advances  in  ICT.  The  Government  has  taken  actions  to \nrefurbish  some  of  the  existing  facilities.  To  make  the  CEIEE  a  self-sustaining  institution,  a \nbusiness  plan  was  developed  with  assistance  from  the  United  States  that  describes  the \ngovernance structure, potential markets for English education, and revenues from the provision \nof  services.  12  academic  staff  positions  have  been  approved  to  complement  the  existing  6 \nacademic staff.  \n \n26. \nThe Project will support the refurbishment of selected buildings, provision of furnishings \nand  ICT  equipment  and  staff  development  in  new  instructional  methods.  It  will  support  a \nresidential and distance education program for teachers and other educators of English. A total \nof 7,000 teachers will have improved English competency. One 9-seat passenger van and one \n24-seat  passenger  bus  will  be  provided.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancy  services  in \ndistance and online course delivery methods  and learning materials development. This will be \ncomplemented by a long term international expert in English language teaching to be provided \nby the United States Agency for International Development.  \n \n27. \nUpgrading  of  SLIATE.  SLIATE  provides  ND  and  HND  programs  in  engineering  and \nbusiness  studies  nationwide  through  12  Advanced  Technological  Institutes  (ATI).  The  Project \nwill  assist  SLIATE  institutions  to  develop  into  more  market-responsive  providers  of  demand-\ndriven, high-quality tertiary education programs. SLIATE institutions are expected to become a \npositive  alternative  for  A  level  graduates  that  do  not  gain  admission  to  the  universities.  By \nupgrading  SLIATE,  the  Project  will  complement  the  DEMP  and  TEDP,  and  the  World  Bank- \nsupported  project  in  undergraduate  education  in  expanding  a  variety  of  quality  and  relevant \ntertiary education opportunities.  \n \n28. \nThe Project will assist SLIATE in further developing their Strategic Plan 2007\u20132010 for \ngrowth  in  student  enrollment  and  the  expansion  of  programs.  It  will  upgrade  the  12  ATIs  by \nfurnishing  selected  classrooms,  labs  and  workshops.  Industry  advisory  councils  will  be \ndeveloped  and  the  curriculum  revised  to  be  more  market  responsive.  The  occupational \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nstandards provided by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) will be \nused  in  the  curriculum  revision.  SLIATE  has  identified  new  areas  of  technology  identified  as \nhighly  demanded  in  the  labor  market  through  annual  reports  of  the  Central  Bank  and  by \nmembers of academic syndicates. New courses will be developed in software engineering, food \ntechnology,  aquaculture,  horticulture,  telecommunications,  and  construction  management.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  cadre  positions  required  for  program  expansion,  including \nmanagement  of  the  new  courses,  will  remain  available  and  that  recruitment  will  take  place \naccordingly. SLIATE programs will improve through greater access to ICT, revised instructional \nmaterials, and improved capacity of teaching staff. Minor renovations and upgrading of electrical \nservices  and  installation  of  local  area  network  cabling  for  ICT  laboratories  and  student  work \nstations  will  be  provided.  The  Project  will  strengthen  SLIATE  administrative  capacity  through \ndevelopment  of  a  Management  Information  System  (MIS).  All  SLIATE  ATIs  will  be  equipped \nwith  computers  to  support  administrative  functions.  Study  rooms  of  25-student  capacity \nequipped with a minimum of two computers will be provided for each ATI. Local, regional and \ninternational professional development programs for staff will be implemented. Support provided \nunder  the  Project  will  be  complementary  to  the  assistance  provided  by  Kuwait  for  facility \nupgrade,  and  by  Austria  and  the  Netherlands  for  courses  in  mechanical,  civil,  and  electronic \nengineering.  \n \n29. \nUse  of  ICT  in  Learning.  The  Project  will  continue  supporting  the  expansion  of  ICT \neducation as well as the use of ICT in learning in secondary schools. 2,125 type 28 secondary \nschools  that  have  not  been  supported  under  SEMP  II  will  be  equipped  with  a  minimum  of  3 \ncomputers, uninterrupted power supplies and a printer. Teacher training in computer skills and \nthe use of ICT in learning will be conducted. Eligibility criteria for receiving equipment are that \nthe  school  has:  (i)  a  minimum  enrolment  of  200  students;  (ii)  electricity;  (iii)  a  secure  weather \nresistant facility to house the computers; (iv) available staff to introduce ICT in school; and (v) \nnot received previous assistance. Schools supported under SEMP and SEMP II will continue to \nbe assisted with learning materials, teacher training and progress monitoring.  \n  \n30. \nInitiative  for  Innovative  ICT  for  Learning  (IIIL).  The  Project  will  provide  funding  to \nsmall  or  locally-based  initiatives,  involving  secondary  schools,  community  groups,  and  the \nprivate  sector  to  enhance  innovative  use  of  ICT  for  learning.  A  maximum  of  $50,000  for  such \nprojects, or smaller sums for enhancement of ongoing school-based initiatives, will be provided. \nProjects proposed by schools are expected to contribute to the achievement of MOE objectives \nto:  (i)  facilitate  grassroots  innovation  in  teaching  and  learning  using  ICT;  and  (ii)  promote  and \nfacilitate the formation of multi-stakeholder partnerships for the enhancement and/or replication \nof  small-scale  and  community-based  initiatives.  All  public secondary  schools  will  be  eligible  to \napply  for  IIIL.  Eligibility  criteria  will  be  established,  the  program  advertised,  and  invitations  for \nproposals will be released semi-annually. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproved HIV/AIDS and Health Education  \n\n \n31. \nHIV/AIDS education will be introduced within a comprehensive school health promotion \nprogram  that  establishes  a  foundation  for  understanding  the  relationships  between  personal \nbehavior  and  health.  The  HIV/AIDS  and  health  education  program  will  take  into  account  the \ndevelopmental levels of different age groups of students and be culturally sensitive. Systematic \nreview of evidence from developing countries has shown that the most effective programs are \nthose that are curriculum-based and led by adults. The target groups will be those studying in \nsecondary schools from grades 6 to 11 and young adults in the NCOEs and TTCs. \n\n                                                 \n8 Type 2 schools offer classes from grade 1 to 11 (see Appendix 2)  \n\n\f9 \n\n \n32. \nThe Project will support: (i) integration of HIV/AIDS and health education into secondary \nschool  curricula;  (ii)  instructional  material  development  and  teacher  training;  and  (iii)  teacher \nand student support. A multidisciplinary group of subject experts and trainers will be established \nat national level in order to train a core group of trainers at zonal level, who in turn will train and \nsupport the teachers in schools. Zonal resource centers will be established in each zone\u2019s TC. \nThese zonal resource centers will provide interactive self learning material for students to further \ntheir  knowledge.  The  zonal  core  group  of  trainers  will  also  use  opportunities  provided  through \nco-curricular  activities  such  as  youth  clubs  and  school  health  clubs  to  address  related  issues. \nIndicators  will  be  developed  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  process,  outcome,  and  impact  of  the \nprogram.  Criteria  will  be  developed  and  a  system  of  accreditation  established  to  recognize \nschools with good performance. The School Health and Nutrition Unit of the MOE will plan and \ncoordinate  project  implementation  in  partnership  with  NIE  and  the  Ministry  of  Health.  The \nProject will provide civil works for office refurbishment for the School Health and Nutrition Unit of \nMOE  and  the  zonal  resources  centers,  furniture  and  multi-media  equipment  for  the  zonal \nresource  centers,  international  and  local  training,  consultancy  services,  and  operating \nexpenses, such as monitoring and communication costs. This component will be financed under \nan Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant for HIV/AIDS. It will be also supported by a regional \ntechnical assistance financed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.9 \nA description of the HIV/AIDS health education component is in Appendix 6. \n  \n\n4. \n\nImproved Policy, Governance and Service Delivery  \n\n \n33. \nSenior Level Policy Coordination and Partnership Mechanism. A central mechanism \nfor  policy  dialogue  among  senior  representatives  of  general  and  tertiary  education,  TEVT  and \nthe private sector will be established to improve coordination and partnerships among education \nand  training  providers.  This  mechanism  will  be  formally  established  among  MOE,  MHE,  the \nMinistry of Vocational and Technical Training (MVTT) and private sector representatives. It will \nbe linked with the ongoing policy development process in tertiary education under the National \nEducation  Commission.  The  Project  will  support  research  studies  for  policy  analysis  and \ndevelopment, best education practices, seminars and workshops, international exchanges and \npeer reviews with education policy makers in Asia. The policy coordination mechanism will also \nadvocate  and  facilitate  education  partnerships  in:  (i)  curricula;  (ii)  teacher  development;  (iii) \nassessment;  (iv)  service  delivery;  (v)  accreditation;  (vi)  quality  standards  and  assurance;  (vii) \nPPP;  (viii)  career  guidance;  and  (ix)  social  marketing.  One  of  immediate  actions  will  be  the \nsetting  up  of  the  education-industry  forum  for  CBE  development.  NIE  will  take  the  technical \nleadership for such forum in partnership with the private sector. Another area of importance is \nthe Education-Industry Partnership in career guidance. Technical assistance to further elaborate \nthe organizational structure and working mechanism of such an inter-agency policy coordination \nbody will be provided.10  \n \n34. \nIntegrated Management Information System. A management information system will \nbe designed and implemented to consolidate and integrate education system information. This \nwill  include  business  processes  for  finance,  personnel,  planning,  student  records,  resource \nallocation  and  monitoring,  and  research  functions  that  will  provide  reliable  data  in  a  timely \nmanner.  A  secured  network  operating  center  will  be  established.  The  data  communication \nnetwork at MOE will be upgraded. Zonal offices will have improved computer access and data \ncommunication capacity. \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006.

Management  and  Leadership  Training.  Education  management  and  leadership \nprograms will be developed and delivered to provincial and zonal officers and school principals. \nThe  programs  will  be  conducted  through  the  Center  for  Education  Leadership  Development \n(CELD) of NIE. The capacity of CELD will be developed. The Project will support master degree \nstudies for four staff and other opportunities in professional development, such as participation \nin  conferences  and  workshops,  to  teaching  staff  at  CELD.  The  Project  will  support  CELD  to \nconduct  one  management  training  certificate  program  and  one  education  leadership  program. \nThe  instructional  materials  and  methods  will  support  multi-mode  delivery  using  residency, \ndistance education and self-directed learning. Approximately 4,000 education administrators will \nbenefit from the education management certificate program and 200 will obtain a Master degree \nin education leadership through CELD. \n  \n36. \nCareer  Guidance.  The  Project  will  support  strengthening  career  guidance  through  the \ninter-agency  coordination  mechanism  involving  MOE,  MHE,  MVTT  and  the  private  sector.  A \ncareer  guidance  committee  composed  of  the  Career  Guidance  Unit  of  MOE,  the  Tertiary  and \nVocational  Education  Commission,  SLIATE  Director-General,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  the \nFederation  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  other  industry  associations  will  develop  detailed \nannual  plans  and  strategies  and  oversee  implementation.  Furthermore,  under  the  Education-\nIndustry  Partnership,  industry  representatives  and  educators  will  jointly  implement  career \nguidance  activities  in  schools,  develop  a  career  guidance  manual,  and  train  school  principals \nand teachers in career guidance. Work of the career guidance committee will be assisted by an \ninternational and a domestic career guidance specialist.  \n \nA  network  of  92  zonal  resource  centers  staffed  and  equipped  to  assist  teachers, \n37. \nstudents and parents will be developed. Existing TCs throughout the country will be used for this \npurpose.11 The TCs will be provided with two computers with access to Internet. One full time \nstaff  from  each  province  will  undergo  professional  development  program  leading  to  a  post-\ngraduate diploma in career guidance and vocational counseling. The qualified staff, assisted by \nthe  career  guidance  specialist,  will  deliver  training  programs  to  a  minimum  of  800  teachers \nassigned  to  provide  career  guidance  in  secondary  schools  and  to  184  TC  staff.  The  career \nguidance  committee  will  develop  a  comprehensive  career  guidance  manual  and  materials, \nincluding a list of available resources, websites and private sector contacts. A website hosted by \nMOE  will  provide  current  information  to  support  the  planning  and  delivery  of  career  guidance. \nThe  website  will  give  labor  market  information,  and  link  to  the  Chambers  of  Commerce, \nJobsNet12 and education and training programs available through TEVT and SLIATE networks. \n  \n38. \nSocial Marketing. The Project will support a social marketing strategy and information \ncampaign  to  promote  change  in  prevailing  attitudes  and  bias  towards  admission  to  university \nand  employment  in  the  public  sector.  A  domestic  social  marketing  specialist  will  assist  in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  a  social  marketing  strategy  and  program.  The  program  will \nincrease  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  various  career  options,  and  the  institutions  providing \nprograms  leading  to  the  selected  options.  To  sustain  the  social  marketing  initiative  at  the \nnational  and  provincial  level,  the  Project  will  support  a  minimum  of  30  people  from  MOE  and \nPMEs  to  complete  a  certificate  program  in  social  marketing  offered  by  the  OUSL.  This  social \nmarketing  strategy  complements  the  ongoing  investment  through  the  TEDP.  Private  sector \n\n                                                 \n11  The  same  teacher  center  will  be  used  for  providing  other  resources  for  teacher  support  such  as  HIV/AIDS  and \n\nhealth education and serve as multifunction teacher resource centers.   \n\n12 JobsNet is  an on-line and service center-based  employment delivery network  of the Ministry  of Employment and \n\nLabor. \n\n\f11 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n\nparticipation in developing the social marketing strategy and campaign will be assured through \nthe social marketing specialist\u2019s participation in the career guidance committee. \n  \nC. \n \n39. \nA  $15,000,000  grant  will  support:  (i)  the  scholarship  program;  (ii)  the  IIIL;  and  (iii)  the \nHIV/AIDS health education program. The scholarship program will help poor families in sending \ntheir  children  to  the  upgraded  schools.  The  IIIL  will  support  grassroots  innovation  in  ICT  for \nlearning.  The  HIV/AIDS  health  education  program  of  $5,000,000  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with the criteria outlined in the ADF IX grant program for HIV/AIDS and infectious \ndisease  control  activities.  The  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be  carefully  monitored  through \nregular project review and reporting, the midterm review, and impact studies.  \n   \nD. \n \n40. \nEducation  Partnerships.  To  meet  the  challenges  of  the  fast  changing  economy,  the \neducation system can no longer rely solely on individual public sector ministries to provide and \nfinance  education  services.  Partnership  building  with  the  private  sector,  local  governments, \ncommunities,  schools,  and  among  ministries  will  be  a  key  strategy  to  improve  quality  and \nrelevance of education. The Project promotes innovative partnerships in key selected areas: (i) \ncooperation,  and  resource  and  knowledge  sharing  with  the  private  sector  in  curriculum \ndevelopment,  career  guidance,  social  marketing,  training  and  service  delivery  in  ICT  for \nlearning, and in business processes; (ii) with the Ministry of Labor on labor market information \ndissemination;  (iii)  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  on  HIV/AIDS  health  education;  (iv)  multi-\nstakeholder partnerships between schools, communities, and the private sector under the IIIL; \nand (v) partnerships between MOE, PME, zonal offices, and schools to develop and sustain the \nupgraded  secondary  schools,  and  enhance  bottom  up  planning  and  management.  The  high \nlevel inter-agency policy coordination mechanism established between MOE, MHE, MVTT and \nprivate  sector  representatives  will  be  the  vehicle  to  initiate,  monitor  and  sustain  such \npartnerships. It is expected that in the long-term, education partnerships will be mainstreamed in \nall aspects of education planning, management, financing, and monitoring.  \n    \nE. \n \n41. \nThe  total  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $105.3  million  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$7.9  million.

MOE will be the Executing Agency. The project steering committee (PSC) for SEMP II will \nbe enlarged and serve  as the  PSC  for the Project. It  will direct the  Project,  monitor its activities \nand  outputs,  guide  the  Project  Management  Office  (PMO),  and  coordinate  and  liaise  with  other \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments.  The  Secretary  of  MOE  will  chair  the  PSC,  whose \nmembers  will  comprise  the  Secretary  of  MHE,  representatives  of  MVTT,  MOE,  the  Finance \nCommission,  the  External  Resources  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National \nPlanning  Department,  NIE,  NETS,  PME,  the  National  Education  Commission,  the  Ministry  of \nHealth,  and  the  Federation  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  as  well  as  one  Provincial \nDirector of Education on a rotating basis.  \n \n45. \nThe  implementation  agencies  will  be  the  respective  units  under  MOE,  the  Provincial \nDepartments  of  Education,  Zonal  Education  Offices,  NIE,  CELD,  NETS,  SLIATE  Directorate-\nGeneral  and  SLIATE  Centers,  and  the  NCOE  in  Peradeniya.  Close  coordination  will  be \nmaintained  between  MOE  and  MHE  for  the  implementation  of  the  SLIATE  sub-component.13 \nPartnership  will  be  initiated  between  MOE  and  MHE  for  the  implementation  of  the  HIV/AIDS \nhealth education component through a technical committee. Industry representatives under the \ncoordination  of  the  Federation  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  will  jointly  implement  selected \nactivities. Considering the need to review the capacity of NIE as implementing agency, MOE will \nundertake  an  institutional  audit  of  NIE  prior  to  project  implementation,  which  will  include  a \nhuman resources plan with budget allocation. Such audit will be conducted under the ongoing \nSEMP II. A project implementation responsibility matrix is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n  \n46. \nA  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  fund  management,  procurement,  and  accounting.  It  will \ncoordinate  implementation  of  project  activities  by  the  implementing  agencies  at  all  levels.  To \nensure project complementarity, SEMP II\u2019s PMO will take responsibilities for the management of \nthe  Project,  with  additional  staff  required.  The  current  organization  consists  of  a  central  PMO \nand 8 provincial PMOs. Each office is staffed by a Provincial Project Manager, a secretary, and \na driver. SEMP II is scheduled to be finished by December 2009, while the Project is estimated \nto start in 2008 and end in 2012. There will be a two-year overlap of the projects during 2008-\n2009.  The  Project  will  utilize  the  SEMP  II\u2019s  PMO  during  this  overlap.  Project  implementation \ncosts  will  be  assumed by  the  Project  starting  in  2010.  At SEMP  II  completion,  MOE  and  ADB \nwill jointly review staff resource requirements and make adjustment as required. \n   \n47. \nThe  SEMP  II  PMO  will  be  strengthened  to  assume  the  additional  responsibilities, \nincluding  positions  for  a  deputy  project  director,  an  education  specialist,  a  procurement \nspecialist,  an  accountant,  an  ICT  specialist  and  5  management  assistants.  In  addition,  a  sub-\nunit  will  be  added  for  the  central  PMO  to  work  specifically  on  school  upgrading,  comprising  a \nprogram  manager,  engineer,  architect,  2  technical  assistants,  a  draughtsman,  2  management \nassistants, and a driver. A new Provincial PMO will be established in the Northern Province,14 \ncomprising a Provincial Project Manager, a secretary, a management assistant, and a driver. An \nadditional position for a management assistant will be added to all Provincial PMOs. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  Due  to  the  recent  change  in  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  SLIATE,  which  was  previously  under  the  administrative \n\nsupervision of MOE, has moved under the supervision of MHE.     \n\n14  Until December 2006, Northern and Eastern provinces were amalgamated in one province.      \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nThe SEMP II PMO has been working in a fully integrated manner with MOE as well as \n48. \nwith  the  Provincial  Departments  of  Education,  maintaining  regular  coordination  with  the  MOE \nPlanning Division as well as with the Planning Division at the Provincial level. The PMO with the \nadditional responsibilities will continue working in the same manner. The PMEs are expected to \nbe fully involved in the selection of secondary schools to be upgraded. MOE\u2019s Planning Division, \nincluding the foreign aid funded project focal point and the Provincial Departments of Education, \nwill ensure that the Project\u2019s contribution to the ESDFP annual planning and budgeting process \nis accurately reflected, and that no duplication of activities with other government or foreign fund \naided activities will occur.    \n \n49. \nThe  Project,  including  the  HIV/AIDS  health  education  component  financed  under  the \ngrant,  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  January  2008  to  December  2012.  The  Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.    \n  \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n50. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Each  contract  for  goods  and \nservices of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding \nprocedures,  while  contract  packages  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  National \nCompetitive Bidding (NCB). All civil works contracts will be awarded through NCB. Civil works \nprocurement will ensure universal access for the disabled in accordance with the Government \nCircular  of  17  October  2006,  and  will  also  follow  the  Central  Environment  Authority  guidelines \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Before the commencement of any procurement activity \nunder  NCB,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s  procurement  law  to  ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Minor  items  valued  at  less  than  $10,000 \nequivalent will be procured directly following Government procedures. A procurement plan is in \nAppendix 9.  \n   \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n51. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  A  team  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  provide  services  in  a \nrange  of  specializations,  with  estimated  international  inputs  of  69  person-months  and  national \ninputs of 300 person-months under the loan, and 15 person-months of international inputs and \n54 person-months of national inputs under the grant. The consultants will be engaged through \nfirms  using  the  quality-and  cost-based  selection  method.  The  quality-cost  ratio  will  be  80:20. \nApproximately  3  international  and  4  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  individual \nrecruitment. Consultant inputs from the Project will be closely coordinated with those provided \nunder SEMP II and projects assisted by other development partners. A summary of consulting \nservices  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.   \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \n\n\f15 \n\nloan  and  regulations,  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MOE  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  following  project-\nspecific anticorruption measures have also been included in the design: (i) under the SEMP II, \nMOE  established  a  complaint  investigation  and  resolution  unit  within  MOE's  internal  Auditors \nDepartment.  The  Project  will  continue  to  support  the  use  of  this  unit,  including  for  complaints \nrelated  to  the  award  of  scholarships;  (ii)  detailed  selection  criteria  and  guidelines  for  the \nselection of schools to be upgraded as well as for awarding scholarships and awarding projects \nunder  the  IIIL  will  be  prepared  and  agreed  upon  in  the  initial  stage  of  project  implementation, \nthus  discouraging  abuse  during  the  subsequent  selection  processes;  (iii)  regular  disclosure  of \nproject-related  information  through  the  MOE  web  page  and  school  net15  to  increase \ntransparency, accountability, and efficiency; (iv) six-monthly review of fiduciary issues, inclusive \nof  financial  management  and  audit  findings  and  sample  checks  of  statements  of  expenditure; \nand  (v)  annual  financial  audit  and  capacity  development  to  be  undertaken  by  an  external \nfinancial auditor appointed by the Auditor-General and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n53.  MOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  for  requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  and  grant \nfunds, two imprest accounts (one for the loan and another for the grant) will be established in \nthe  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  6  months  projected \ndisbursements  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  or  grant  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  procedures \nmay be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest \naccounts in accordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \nMOE will coordinate the timely release of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of \nthe imprest accounts and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the \nannual audit report.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\nThe Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \n54. \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  MOE  will  maintain \nseparate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial \nstatements are audited annually by independent auditors appointed by the Auditor-General and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related \nfinancial  statements,  including  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds, \ncompliance  with  project  covenants,  and  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  under  ADB\u2019s  SOE \nprocedure,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  in  English  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal year. MOE will  ensure that recommendations of the annual external audit \nare implemented accordingly.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15 School net is a wide-area network of more than 1,000 senior secondary schools and other educational institutions, \n\ninitiated under the Secondary Education Modernization Project.     \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nThe  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  progress  of  project  implementation  and \n55. \nsubmit them to ADB and MOE within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate (i) progress made against established targets, (ii) status of \nperformance  indicators,  (iii)  problems  encountered  and  actions  taken  to  address  them, \n(iv) compliance with project covenants, and (v) proposed program of activities for the following \nquarter. Within 3 months after project physical completion, the Government will submit to ADB a \nproject  completion  report  describing  project  implementation,  accomplishments,  benefits, \nimpacts, costs, and compliance with project covenants. \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n7. \n\n56. \nTo  ensure  efficient  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  provide \nADB with the next fiscal year\u2019s project operational plan at least 30 days before the start of the \nnext  fiscal  year.  The  operational  plan  will  include:  (i)  project  activities  with  cost  estimates  and \nperformance targets proposed for each component/subcomponent; (ii) a plan for complying with \noutstanding  project  covenants;  (iii)  a  breakdown  of  financial  requirements,  including  loan  and \ngrant proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; and (iv) details of how \nproject activities will be integrated into the ESDFP\u2019s annual plan and budget.  \n \n57.  MOE  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem acceptable to ADB. Project monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of MOE \nthrough  the  PMO.  Within  the  first  6  months  of  implementation,  a  baseline  study  will  be \nconducted  to  refine  and  expand  verifiable  indicators  of  project  inputs,  outputs,  and  outcomes. \nData will be segregated by gender and ethnicity.   \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review   \n\n58. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly review the Project\u2019s progress at least twice a year. \nBesides  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review \nduring the Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the project scope, design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity-building  processes;  \n(ii) review any changes in the Government\u2019s policies and institutional framework since appraisal \nand  evaluate  their  impact  on  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii)  assess  project \nimplementation  against  appropriate  projections/performance  indicators;  (iv)  review  compliance \nwith loan covenants; (v) identify critical issues and constraints; and (vi) recommend changes in \nproject  design  or  implementation  as  needed.  The  midterm  review  will  specifically  assess  the \nequity of resource distribution across regions, gender, ethnicity, and medium of instruction of all \nproject components and make adjustments if required. The status of project implementation in \nthe conflict-affected areas, including the Project quota for schools in the Northern Province (see \npara.  65)  will  be  also  assessed.  Adjustments  will  be  made  in  project  scope  or  implementation \narrangements as necessary.       \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts  \n\nA. \n \n59. \nSectoral  Benefits  and  Impact.  The  Project  will  benefit  primary  and  secondary  school \nstudents in the 150 poorest administrative divisions. The upgraded schools will provide higher \nquality teaching in key subjects of sciences, English, ICT, and technical subjects. This will widen \nthe students\u2019 options for tertiary education, and ultimately their career paths. Reform in CBE will \nmake  education  more  outcomes-based,  and  thus  more  practical.  Expansion  of  SBA  will  make \n\n\f17 \n\nassessment  more  comprehensive  and  less centered  on  national  examinations.  Greater  use  of \nICT  for  learning  will  diversify  and  enrich  both  teaching  and  learning.  Enhanced  linkages  with \nindustry  will  help  students  understand  the  world  of  work.  Capacity  enhancement  of  school \nprincipals  and  education  administrators  will  improve  management  efficiency.  Upgrading  of \nSLIATE will expand tertiary education opportunities in all provinces. Education partnerships will \nhave  a  positive  institutional  impact,  helping  the  system  to  be  more  responsive  to  diversified \nneeds, securing more resources to education, and promoting a holistic view of the entire sector. \nAll  Project  interventions  will  contribute  to  the  knowledge-based  society  which  the  Government \nenvisions.  Ultimately,  education  content,  methodology,  service  delivery  and  governance  will \nimprove and become more relevant to the needs of the modern economy and society.  \n \n60. \nEconomic Benefit. Improved quality and relevance, and increased access to secondary \nand  tertiary  education  will  lead  to  increased  internal  and  external  efficiency.  Increased \nparticipation and completion rates at secondary and tertiary level will reduce education wastage \nand  reduce  burden  on  public  expenditure.  Availability  of  a  skilled  labor  force  in  key  sectors  of \nthe economy will contribute to national economic growth, which in turn will create more jobs for \nthe  educated  youth.  A  summary  of  the  project  demand  and  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix \n11, and detailed analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n61. \nSocial  Benefits  and  Poverty  Impact.  The  upgrading  of  secondary  schools  in  the \npoorest  administrative  divisions  will  yield  positive  benefits  to  children  in  disadvantaged \ncommunities. Access to teaching in key subjects such as sciences, mathematics, English, ICT, \nand  technical  subjects  will  help  these  children  breaking  into  better  incomes  and  employment \nperspectives. As the proportion of schools to benefit from the Project\u2019s interventions will follow \nthe  School  Census  Data,  equity  among  Sinhala,  Tamil,  and  Muslim  students  will  be  ensured. \nAffirmative  action  to  address  weakness  in  English  teaching  in  Tamil  medium  schools  will \nespecially benefit Tamil medium students. Expansion of tertiary education opportunities through \nSLIATE  will  also  increase  access  to  higher  skills  upgrade  by  poor  students  from  all  ethnic \ngroups, leading to better jobs in local and foreign markets. Ultimate success of the secondary \nschool upgrade could result in reestablishment of local communities as children presently forced \nto  attend  secondary  school  in  urban  areas  will  have  access  to  an  upgraded  school  closer  to \nhome.  Development  of  multi-ethnic  and  multi-lingual  schools  will  promote  better  multi-ethnic \nunderstanding.  Overall,  a  more  socially  inclusive  education  system  will  reduce  social  tension \nand enhance social cohesion among different ethnic groups. The Summary Poverty Reduction \nand Social Strategy is in Appendix 12. An Ethnic Equity Framework (EEF) is in Appendix 13. \n \nProject Risks   \nB. \n  \n \n62. \nSustainability  of  Project  Investment.  Lessons  identified  from  earlier  projects  show  a \nrisk that facilities of the institutions upgraded under projects may not be maintained after project \ncompletion.  The  Government  has  assured  that  sufficient  recurrent  cost  will  be  provided  to \nmaintain  the  facilities  financed  under  the  Project.  Furthermore,  cost-recovery  measures  and \nbusiness plans have been developed for the upgrading of SLIATE institutions, the CEIEE, and \nthe  CELD.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  the  upgraded  schools  may  fail  to  secure  an  adequate \nnumber of qualified teachers. Therefore, disbursement conditions ensure that no funds for the \nupgrading of any school will be disbursed unless the school has prepared a time-bound plan for \nthe  selection  and  deployment  of  the  needed  teachers  and  principal,  and  until  MOE  and  PME \nhave allocated the requested cadre. All cadre positions thus allocated will be filled prior to the \ndisbursement of any funds required for the implementation of the Project operation plan of the \nsubsequent year for that particular school. \n \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nInstitutional  Capacity.  Performance  of  earlier  projects  demonstrates  the  adequate \n63. \nimplementation capacity of MOE as EA. An adequate number of additional staff will be hired for \nSEMP  II\u2019s  PMO  to  implement  the  Project.  Close  monitoring  and  guidance  from  ADB  will  be \nprovided  to  SEMP  II\u2019s  PMO  in  handling  multiple  project  accounts.  Experience  under  SEMP \nraises  concern  over  shortage  of  staff  of  NIE  and  its  implementation  capacity.  NIE  will  ensure \nthat its vacancies related to curriculum development will be filled with an appropriate mixture of \ncandidates  with  considerable  experience  in  teaching  in  a  particular  subject,  and  graduate \ncandidates that are up-to-date with the latest findings and trends in such subject. Furthermore, \nan institutional audit, including a human resources plan with budget allocation will be conducted \nand a sufficient number of allocated vacancies filled before project activities at NIE start. \n  \n64. \nSafeguard  Measures.  The  Project  will  not  cause  displacement  of  any  families  or \nhouseholds as civil works are limited to existing school property and the renovation of existing \nSLIATE  and  CEIEE  buildings.  In  the  event  land  acquisition  is  required,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  will  be \nfollowed.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  a \nResettlement  Framework.  No  adverse  environmental  impact  is  anticipated.  Civil  works  will \nfollow country specific environmental guidelines and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Disposal \nof  hazardous  chemicals  that  may  be  used  during  science  classes  will  be  consistent  with  the \nhandling and safe disposal measures already employed in the secondary schools in the country.  \n  \nConflict Sensitivity. The Project will ensure that all target beneficiaries gain access to \n65. \nresources  provided  by  the  Project  irrespective  of  gender,  ethnicity,  and  geographic  location. \nHowever,  peace  and  security  concerns  may  affect  activities  in  the  conflict-affected  areas. \nTherefore, the Project will build maximum flexibility in its implementation to ensure that children \nin those areas are not excluded from the benefits of the Project. For instance, for the upgrading \nof secondary schools, if in any given year selected schools from the Northern Province cannot \nbe upgraded due to security concerns, those schools will be replaced in that year with schools \nfrom another province, but the overall project quota for schools to be upgraded in the Northern \nProvince will not change. Furthermore, reallocation of funds among schools within the Northern \nProvince  will  be  agreed  between  MOE  and  ADB.  Refurbishment  of  schools  in  the  conflict-\naffected  areas  will  only  take  place  with  the  assurances  of  a  return  to  peace  and  security.  All \nupgrading  and  development  work  will  be  done  with  people  from  the  area.  Close  monitoring  of \nsecurity  conditions  will  mitigate  risks.  Local  labor  will  be  used  for  civil  works.  The  status  of \nproject  implementation  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  will  be  assessed  periodically  and \nadjustment made in project scope or implementation arrangements as necessary.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurance,  the  Government  and  MOE  have  given  the \n\n66. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWithin  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  coordination  mechanism  between  the \nMOE,  MHE,  MVTT,  and  the  private  sector  will  be  established,  aiming  at \nharmonizing  policies  for  the  broader  education  sector,  and  promoting  multi-\nstakeholder education partnerships in key policy reform areas. \nThe  selection  of  schools  to  be  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  be  done  in \naccordance with the selection criteria and the procedures agreed between MOE \nand  ADB  and  taking  into  account  geographical  distribution.  In  the  first  year, \napproximately  60  schools  will  be  selected,  and  about  60  schools  every  year \nthereafter, up to a maximum of 150 schools. If in any given year selected schools \nfrom the Northern Province cannot be upgraded due to security concerns, those \n\n\f19 \n\n(iii) \n\nschools will be replaced in that year with schools from another province, but the \noverall project quota for schools to be upgraded from the Northern Province will \nnot  change.  Furthermore,  reallocation  of  funds  among  schools  within  the \nNorthern Province will be agreed between MOE and ADB.  \nthe \nThroughout  Project \nGovernment  will  allocate  sufficient  funds  from  its  budget  to  maintain  an \nacceptable  level  of  operation  and  maintenance  of  schools,  including  for  (1)  the \navailability  of  water,  sanitation,  and  utilities;  (2)  maintenance  and  repair  of \ncomputers; and (3) salaries of teachers, principals, and support staff. \n\nimplementation  and  after  Project  completion, \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Within 12 months of the effectiveness date, MOE will have reviewed and updated \nthe  action  plans,  including  incentives  and  disincentives,  for  teacher  transfer  to \nrural and disadvantaged areas that were prepared under SEMP II. \nAll  scholarships  will  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and  guidelines \ndeveloped  for  the  selection  and  management  of  scholarships,  which  will  be \nprepared  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  guidelines  will  include  a \ncomplaint and grievance procedure. \nAt the latest by the midterm review during the Project\u2019s third year, MOE will have \nconducted an impact and tracer study of the scholarship program. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  MOE will ensure that all required allocated positions for the CEIEE will be filled \n\nprior to the commencement of the respective training program.  \n\n(viii)  The SLIATE centers to be upgraded under the Project will be selected in such a \nway as to ensure geographical distribution. The upgrading of any SLIATE center \nshall  be  in  line  with  the  SLIATE  Strategic  Plan  2007\u20132010,  as  may  be  updated \nfrom time to time.  \n\n(ix)  MOE and MHE will ensure that the revision of SLIATE\u2019s curriculum will be done \n\n(x) \n\nin accordance with appropriate occupational standards. \nMOE  and  MHE  will  ensure  that  cadre  positions  required  for  SLIATE\u2019s  program \nexpansion, including management of the new courses, will remain available and \nthat recruitment will take place within 12 months of loan effectiveness. \n\n(xi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the CELD will be established as a center \n\n(xii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line \n\nunder the NIE Act.  \n\nwill be installed at the CELD. \n\n(xiii)  MOE  and  MHE  will  ensure  that  any  staff from  NIE,  CELD,  CEIEE,  and  SLIATE \ncenters  who  participate  in  a  training  course  of  more  than  one  month  will  have \nsuitable replacements prior to starting the course.   \n\n(xiv)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established the \nInitiative for Innovative ICT for Learning (IIIL) including operating rules, guidelines \nand selection criteria acceptable to ADB.  \n\n(xv)  MOE  will  ensure  that  all  candidates  for  local  and  international  training  and \nfellowships will be selected in accordance with criteria agreed upon between the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning and ADB. All efforts will be made to retain staff \nwho  have  participated  in  such  international  training  and  fellowships  at  their \nrespective institutions, in accordance with existing regulations. \n\n(xvi)  MOE will ensure that the social marketing campaign will be conducted in the two \n\nofficial languages as well as in English.  \n\n(xvii)  MOE  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \n\nEthnic Equity Framework and the Gender Strategy.  \n\n(xviii)  MOE ensures that all facilities under the Project to be extended or upgraded will \nbe  located  on  land  owned  by  the  Government,  and  that  no  displacement  or \nresettlement  of  people,  including  squatters,  will  be  involved.  All  efforts  shall  be \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n \n67. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nmade  to  ensure  that  no  civil  works  shall  be  included  that  would  require  land \nacquisition,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  voluntary  land  donations.  Should  any \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement nonetheless be required, this shall be \ndone in accordance with the Resettlement Framework. \n\n(xix)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  baseline  monitoring  and  evaluation \n\nstudy will have been completed.  \n\n(xx)  MOE will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws. \n(xxi)  MOE will ensure compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations of \n\nSri Lanka, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n\n(xxii)  MOE shall ensure to  update it\u2019s webpage with Project related information in such \n\na way that promotes transparency, accountability, and efficiency. \n\n(xxiii)  MOE will ensure that the recommendations of the annual external financial audit \nare implemented within 2 months after receipt of such recommendations.  \n\nThe following are conditions for disbursement: \n\nNo funds for the upgrading of any school will be disbursed unless the school has \nprepared  a  time-bound  plan  for  the  selection  and  deployment  of  the  needed \nteachers and principal, and until the MOE and PME have allocated the requested \ncadre. All cadre positions thus allocated will be filled prior to the disbursement of \nany  funds  required  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project  operation  plan  of  the \nsubsequent year for that particular school; and  \nNo  funds  for  NIE  will  be  disbursed  until  the  institutional  audit,  including  the \nhuman  resources  plan  with  budget  allocation  has  been  approved  by  the  NIE \ncouncil and at least 60% of the approved cadre has been filled.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n68. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 41,847,000 to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education for Knowledge \nSociety  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at \nthe  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Financing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $15,000,000  to  the  Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education for Knowledge Society Project \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  on  the  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Financing Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Haruhiko Kuroda \n \n\nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 November 2007\n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 1         21           \n\n\u2022  Birthrate and student \n\nage population remain \nconstant  \n\n \n\u2022  Economy continues to \n\ncreate jobs and \nprovides higher wages \nto graduates with new \nand higher level skills,  \n\nRisk  \n\n\u2022  Economic and social \n\nconditions are unstable \n\n\u2022  Government allocates \nsufficient recurrent \nbudget \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\nData Sources/Reporting  \nMechanisms \n\nImpact  \n\n\u2022  Unemployment rates of \n\n\u2022  Tracer and impact \n\nAssumptions  \n\neducated youth reduced by 5 % \nfrom 2008 to 2012  \n\nstudies. \n\n\u2022  Labor statistics  \n\nIncreased relevance of \nsecondary and tertiary \neducation to labor market \nrequirements, which will lead to \nincreased employability of \neducated youth  \n\nOutcome  \n\nImproved quality, relevance,  \neffectiveness and equity of \naccess to secondary and \ntertiary education, in particular \nin rural and disadvantaged \nlocations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Employment of educated youth \nin the private sector increased \nby 4% from 2008 to 2012  \n\n\u2022  Pass rates of general certificate \nO-level and A-level increased by \n8% from  2008 to 2012, \nespecially in science, \nmathematics  and English  \n\n\u2022  Number of A-level graduates  \nenrolled in nonconventional \ntertiary  education increased by \n4% by 2012  \n\n\u2022  Enrollment rates in secondary \nschools in the 150 poorest \ndivisional secretary divisions \n(DSDs) increased 8% between \n2008 and 2012 \n\n\u2022  Completion rates for grades 6\u2013\n11 students in the 150 poorest \nDSDs increased by 8% \nbetween 2008 and 2012.  \n\n\u2022  Enrollment and completion \n\nrates of SLIATE increased by \n25% and 12% respectively from \n2008 to 2012   \n\n\u2022  Secondary  school\u2019s  students\u2019  \nknowledge  and  skills  related  to \nHIV/AIDS  and  healthy  life  have \nimproved   \n\n\u2022  National Education \n\nTesting Services (NETS) \nstatistics  \n\n2008 (gender and ethnic \ngroup segregated data \nwill be used )   \n\n\u2022  School census  \n\n\u2022  Project reports \n\n\u2022  SLIATE data  \n\n \n \n\u2022  Grant  monitoring  reports. \nStudent survey in year 5   \n\n\u2022  Baseline established in \n\nAssumption  \n\nOutputs  \n\n1: Increased Equity of Access to Education  \n\n1.1.

Tertiary education is open to those who pass the \ngeneral  certificate  advanced  level  (A-level)  national  examination  after  grade  13.  It  consists  of \npublic  universities,  nondegree  private  institutions,  private  institutions  affiliated  with  foreign \nuniversities,  National  Colleges  of  Education  (NCOE),  the  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Advanced \nTechnological  Education  (SLIATE),  and  technical  colleges.  Currently,  only  public  universities \ncan award degrees. Entry to technical and vocational education (TEVT) starts at grade 11 upon \npassing the general certificate ordinary level (O-level) national examination. Sri Lanka has three \ncategories  of  secondary  schools:  (i)  type  1AB  schools  offer  classes  from  grades  1\u201313  with  A-\nlevel options in commerce, arts, and science; (ii) type 1C schools offer classes from grades 1\u2013\n13 with A-level arts and commerce only, and (iii) type 2 schools offer classes from grades 1\u201311 \nin preparation for O-level examinations. Type 1AB schools are generally located in urban areas, \nwhile  type  1C  and  2  schools  are  normally  situated  in  semi  urban  and  rural  areas.  Type  3 \nschools  offer  primary  grades  1\u20135.  Approximately  71%  and  29%  of  schools  use  Sinhala  and \nTamil  as  the  language  of  instruction,  respectively.  English  is  considered  a  link  language  and \nsome schools provide instruction in English.  \n  \n2. \nIn 2006, primary school completion rates were 91% for boys and 94% for girls. In junior \nsecondary, grade 6 enrollment is about 90% of the age cohort. The completion rate declines at \ngrade 9 to about 84%. O-level and A-level pass rates improved between 2001 and 2006, from \n37%  to  49%  for  O  level,  and  50%  to  60%  for  A  level.  However,  pass  rates  in  science, \nmathematics, and English remain lower than the average. Many of those who fail O-level exams \nrepeat the test. Students who pass the O-level exam generally continue to the A level. A-level \ngraduates  compete  for  university  and  other  tertiary  education  institutions,  but  the  system  has \nsuch  limited  intake  capacity  that  only  about  11%  of  those  who  qualify  are  admitted  to  tertiary \neducation  institutions.  Others  seek  higher  skill  upgrading  opportunities  in  TEVT.  Although  the \nquality and relevance of TEVT programs have gradually improved, they offer limited options for \nschool leavers with O- and A-level qualifications. As a consequence, many educated youth are \nunemployed. Despite remarkable attainment in primary education and gradual improvement in \nsecondary  education,  bottlenecks  entering  tertiary  institutions,  including  TEVT,  undermine  the \nachievement and efficiency gained in primary education.   \n \nB. \n  \n \n  \nindustry  representatives \n3. \nidentified a key issue to be school graduates\u2019 lack of generic skills and attitudes required in the \nworkplace,  such  as  communications,  team  work,  problem  solving,  and  critical  thinking.  As  the \nschool  system  has  been  traditionally  oriented  to  university  admission,  education  content  and \nteaching  methodologies  remain  theoretical,  rigid,  and  subservient  to  passing  the  national \nexaminations. Despite several attempts to introduce activity-based learning, the traditional rote \nlearning process has not seen significant changes.  \n \nIn  2006,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  issued  a  directive  to  change  the  secondary \n4. \nschool curriculum  and  teaching  methods  to competency-based  education  (CBE).  The  purpose \nof  the  curriculum  reform  was  to  increase  effective  teaching  and  learning  to  develop  core \n\nStudent  Competencies.  Stakeholder  consultations  with \n\nRelevance and Quality of Education \n\nSector Needs and Challenges \n\n1. \n\n\fAppendix 2         27 \n\ntechnology, \n\nThe  Right  Options.  Science  and \n\ncompetencies  in  communication,  problem  solving,  and  team  work.  The  learner-centered  CBE \napproach  is  intended  to  provide  practical  applications  to  reinforce  the  theoretical  content. \nSchool-based formative assessment of learner performance is an integral part of CBE. The bold \nreforms  in  curriculum,  instruction,  and  evaluation  intend  to  transform  the  Sri  Lanka  education \nsystem to be more responsive to present and future needs. Responsibility for implementing the \nreform was given to the National Institute of Education (NIE), which is responsible for curriculum \ndesign and oversight of teacher education.  \n \ninformation  and  communication \n5. \ntechnology (ICT), and English are considered key study areas that prepare students for better \nemployment  opportunities.  The  challenge  is  to  expand  quality  teaching  and  learning  in  these \nareas  with  the  appropriate  facilities,  equipment,  tools,  and  qualified  teachers,  so  that  students \ncan select the best options. ICT is not only an important subject in itself. Moreover, it can be an \neffective multimedia tool for subject learning that enriches learning content and methods, thus \ncontributing to student\u2019s better mastery of the subject. The eight optional technical subjects at A \nlevel  (agriculture;  information  technology;  and  civil,  mechanical  and  electrical,  automotives, \nrefrigeration, and food preservation and processing technologies) are also important, either as \nprevocational  subjects  or  as  subjects  that  add  practical  knowledge  and  skills  to  core  subject \nlearning. However, the shortage of teachers with appropriate training impedes the availability of \nthese optional technical subjects.  \n   \n6. \nTertiary  Education.  In  addition  to  the  14  universities,  SLIATE,  NCOEs,  and  the \ntechnical colleges, numerous private institutions and 21 ministries ranging from the Ministry of \nTourism  to  the  Ministry  of  Transport  offer  nondegree  tertiary  education.  Because  public \nresource  constraints  limit  the  expansion  of  universities,  these  nonconventional  public  and \nprivate tertiary education institutions will play a greater role in providing a positive alternative for \nA-level  graduates  who  wish  to  pursue  upgrading  of  skills  before  seeking  employment.  These \ninstitutions  typically  offer  diplomas  and  high  national  diplomas  in  selected  professional  fields. \nThe  immediate  task  is  to  upgrade  a  selected  number  of  these  institutions  to  more  market-\nresponsive and high-quality tertiary education providers. The future task would be to establish a \nregulatory  framework  that  regulates  and  facilitates  their  expansion,  and  provide  them  with  a \nquality assurance mechanism.  \n \n7. \nTEVT. TEVT comprises a mixture of planned and unplanned programs promoted by the \nGovernment,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations,  mostly  targeting  school \nleavers  with  O-  and  A-level  qualifications.  The  major  achievements  in  TEVT  today  are  better \nplanning  and  a  better  subsector  structure  that  replaced  earlier  ad  hoc  interventions:  (i)  an \ninstitutionalized  competency-based  training  system,  and  (ii)  a  national  vocational  qualification \nsystem that offers a career path and alternative avenue to higher education. That attainment led \nto  higher  job  relevance  and  self-employment  rates  of  TEVT  graduates.  The  future  task  is  to \nexpand  high-quality  TEVT  programs  in  selected  sectors  that  are  in  high  demand  by  the \neconomy and to establish effective mechanisms to ensure the quality of many private providers \nof training.  \n \n \n \n8. \nFree  Education.  Before  independence  (1949),  the  dual  system  of  education  included \nfee-levying  English  schools  and  non-fee-levying  Sinhala  and  Tamil  schools.  Government \nexpenditure  on  education  was  biased  in  favor  of  urban  English  schools,  while  schools  in  rural \nareas were largely neglected. After independence, various initiatives were introduced to correct \nthe  inequities  through  educational  reforms  implemented  to  improve  conditions,  particularly  in \n\nEquity of Access  \n\n2.  \n\n \n\n\f28         Appendix 2 \n \n\n \n\nremote and rural areas, and for children from disadvantaged groups. The reforms included free \neducation  from  grade  1  to  the  completion  of  the  first  university  degree,  instruction  using  the \nmother  tongue,  provision  of  free  textbooks,  free  midday  meals  in  primary  and  secondary \nschools,  subsidized  transport,  and  free  uniforms.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  success  in  achieving  universal \nprimary education is largely due to thorough reforms that meet the socioeconomic, cultural, and \nlinguistic factors that constrain the demand for education among the poor.  \n      \n9. \nSupply  of  Education.  Many  children  of  poor  families  or  in  marginalized  communities \nhave access to schools, but in many cases the quality is poor. In recent years, the quality gap \nhas increased between the education available in more affluent areas and that in many remote \nlocations including the plantation sector and conflict-affected areas. Despite Government efforts \nto address inequity in supply of good quality education, the colonial model of preferential status \nfor  a  relatively  small  number  of  selected  national  schools  and  inadequate  support  for  the \nmajority  of  provincial  schools  continues  to  dominate  education  governance  and  development. \nUneven  deployment  of  teachers  in  the  country  contributes  to  the  regional  imbalances  in  the \nquality  of  education.  High  demand  by  teachers  to  be  assigned  to  popular  urban  schools  has \ngenerally  led  to  an  oversupply  in  urban  areas  and  shortfall  of  teachers  in  rural  schools.  The \nshortage  of  teachers  is  acute  in  disadvantaged  rural  areas,  the  plantation  sector,  the  conflict-\naffected areas, and Tamil teachers teaching English and science. \n  \nFurthermore, in Northern and Eastern provinces, the escalation of armed conflict during \n10. \nthe  last  two  decades  has  had  considerable  impact  on  education  through  structural  damage  to \nschools, closures of schools, and displacement of pupils and teachers. As of January 2007, the \ntwo  provinces  had  more  than  26,000  displaced  students  and  approximately  1,000  displaced \nteachers.  Displacement  of  teachers  and  students  has  led  to  partial  or  complete  disruption  of \neducation in some of the most affected areas. \n \n11. \nAs children attending urban schools with good learning conditions have a better chance \nof  passing  national  examinations  and  entering  tertiary  education,  inequity  in  supply  of  quality \nprimary and secondary education leads to inequity in tertiary education. The net enrollment rate \nof children in grades 10\u201313 from families in the lowest income quintile is approximately half the \nrate  for  the  richest  quintile.  For  tertiary  education,  the  disparities  widen  even  more:  the  net \nenrollment rate for the richest quintile is 13% compared to 2% for the poorest quintile. Overall, \nthe  lack  of  supply  of  good  education  undermines  efforts  to  provide  free  education  to  needy \nfamilies and children. \n      \n \n   \n12. \nDecentralization.  In  1987,  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  introduced \ngovernance  reform  devolving  authority  for  the  local  administration  and  management  of \neducation  to  the  nine  provinces.  The  legislation  was  well  intended,  timely,  and  sound,  but \nimplementation  has  been  slow.  The  role  of  MOE  is  to  set  education  policy  and  oversee  the \nentire  education  system  in  cooperation  with  provincial  ministries  of  education.  Authority  to \nadminister  and  operate  all  public  primary  and  secondary  schools  is  delegated  to  the  nine \nprovinces,  except  for  the  324  national  schools  administered  directly  by  MOE.  Although  these \nnational  schools  represent  only  3.3%  of  all  schools,  they  enroll  20%  of  the  students.1  The \nprovincial  governance  model  includes  approximately  10  educational  zones  per  province  for  a \ntotal of 92 zonal education offices. The zones are further divided into 325 divisional secretariat \ndivisions, and finally the 9,727 schools.  \n \n                                                 \n1   Department of Census and Statistics. 2004.

School-based management was introduced to \nimprove  school  governance  and  quality  of \nteaching  through  bottom-up  planning  and \nmanagement. However, managerial capacity and leadership of school principals and provincial \nand  zonal  education  officers  need  to  improve,  including  effective  supervision  and  monitoring. \nMOE initiated establishment of quality assurance, however more efforts are needed to expand it \nat the school level. \n       \n\n4. \n\nEducation Financing \n\n  \n14. \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  public  expenditure  on  education  as  a  percentage  of  its  gross  domestic \nproduct has increased from 2.6% in 2005 to 3% in 2007. As the sector has to compete with a \nbroad  range  of  public  services,  the  education  budget  cannot  increase  drastically  unless \nexpenditures  in  other  sectors  such  as  defense  decrease.  MOE  directly  finances  national \nschools. The provincial schools are partly financed by the provincial councils and partly by MOE \nas a block grant for the capital budget. As education is free up to the first university degree, it \nrelies heavily on public resources. The impact of budgetary constraints on access, quality, and \nrelevance  of  education  is  seen  in  both  the  capital  and  recurrent  budgets.  Restrictions  in  the \ncapital  budget  constrain  investment  in  physical  expansion  of  school  facilities  such  as \nclassrooms,  sanitation,  laboratories,  and  libraries.  Provincial  schools  in  rural  areas  particularly \nsuffer.  Recurrent  budget  accounts  for  about  80%  of  public  expenditure  in  education.  As \napproximately  85%\u201390%  is  used  for  salaries,  little  is  left  for  quality  improvement  such  as \nprofessional development for teachers, supervision and monitoring, and quality maintenance of \nexisting facilities. As such, equity of access to, and quality and relevance of education cannot be \nmaintained  or  enhanced  without  cost  recovery  measures  and  cost  sharing.  Public-private \npartnerships  in  service  delivery  will  be  a  viable  means  to  lessen  the  burden  on  public \nexpenditure, especially in secondary education and above. For instance, greater cost sharing in \ntertiary  education  among  nonpoor  students  would  save  on  public  expenditure  in  education, \nwhich  in  turn  can  be  used  to  improve  quality  of  service  delivery  at  lower  levels  of  education. \nHowever, wider public acceptance of public-private partnerships in areas traditionally dominated \nby the public sector, such as general education and tertiary education, remains a key challenge. \n \nC. \n  \n15. \nThe key policy issues in education are summarized in Table A2, along with a description \nof progress in policy reforms, the constraints, and the alternative solutions suggested under the \nEducation for Knowledge Society Project considering the prevailing sociopolitical context. \n\nPolicy Issues: Progress, Challenges, and Alternative Solutions \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable A2: Policy Issues: Progress, Challenges, and Alternative Solutions \n\n \n\neducation. \n\nPolicy Issues \nDecentralization \nThe \nof \ndelineation  of  authority  between  provinces, \nzones and schools in education management \nis  ambiguous.  The  dual  system  of  national \nand  provincial  schools  impedes  efficiency  of \neducation  governance,  and \nin \nequity of access to quality education.    \n\nincreases \n\nProgress \nSchool-based  management  initiated  in \n2000  has  been  more  widely  recognized \nsince 2004. Through bottom-up planning \nand \nschool-based \nmanagement is expected to bring quality \nand  efficiency  in  management  at  the \nschool level.  \n\nmanagement, \n\nConstraints \nAttempts \nto  streamline  education \ngovernance  by  transferring  national \nschools \nprovincial \nunder \nadministration were not successful.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nRegional  disparities \nin  education.  The \nteacher deployment and transfer policy is not \nenforced.  The  pressure  on  parents  to  send \nchildren  to  popular  urban  schools  increases \ngaps  in  enrolment.  As  such,  the  inequitable \ndistribution  of  teachers  and  resources  make \nschools \nwell-equipped \novercrowded,  while  small  schools  in  remote \nareas lack teachers, facilities, and students.  \n\nurban \n\nlarge \n\ninvolvement  and  cost-\nPrivate  sector \nrecovery \nin  education.  To  ease  public \nexpenditure,  and  to  improve  the  quality  of \neducation,  especially \nfor  secondary  and \ntertiary  education,  cost-sharing  and  cost-\nrecovery \nimportant \nin  expenditure  are \nelements.  \n\nAbsence of linkage within and outside the \neducation  system.  Coordination  between \ngeneral  education, \ntertiary  education  and \nTEVT  Is  lacking;  as  is  any  linkage  between \neducation and industry.   \n\nThe  Government  has  attempted \nto \naddress the teacher deployment issue by \n(i)  providing \nto \nfinancial \nteachers  going  to  difficult  areas,  and  (ii) \nintroducing \nteacher \nrecruitment. \n  The  success  of  such \ninitiatives is not yet known.  \n\nschool-based \n\nincentives \n\nyet \n\nThe  Government  has \nto \nundertake robust reforms to address \nthe  issue  of  inequitable  distribution \nof  teachers  and  school  enrollment. \nPolitical \nschool \nadmission and teacher transfer often \noccurs. \n\ninterference \n\nin \n\nInnovative  public-private  partnerships \nhave  been observed at the  project level, \nespecially in the provision of and teacher \ntraining in ICT in education in secondary \neducation. \nPublic-private  partnerships  are  also  an \nimportant  component  of  the  Distance \nProject \nEducation \n(DEMP).

In  addition  to  the  Government  criteria,  selection  of  the  150  schools  to \nreceive funding through the Project will be determined using the following criteria:  \n \n\nThe  school  is  and  will  continue  to  be  administered  by  the  provincial  education \nauthority and not be classified as a national school.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n  \n\n   \n(iv) \n\n  \n(v) \n\n      \n(vi) \n \n(vii) \n\nEligible  schools  will  either  be  type  1C  or  type  2.  In  DSDs  where  a  type  1AB \nschool exists but is assessed as no longer fully functional and satisfies all other \nselection criteria, it may be considered eligible for upgrading.     \n\nThe  DSD  is  ranked  among  the  poorest  150  of  the  325  DSDs  based  on  the \nnational headcount index1 prepared by the Department of Census and Statistics,2 \nSri  Lanka.  Selection  of  DSDs  in  the  Northern  Province  will  be  determined \nseparately,  due  to  the  absence  of  data  for  many  DSDs  in  the  province.  Taking \ninto consideration the national demographic balance3, approximately six schools \nwill be selected in each of the five districts in the Northern Province. Due to the \nspecific challenges for development in the province, the selection of the divisions \nwill  also  consider  strategic  geographic  and  demographic  areas  of  development \npotential.  In  the  conflict-affected  areas,  the  selection  of  schools  to  be upgraded \nwill take into account the security and safety conditions in the region. \n\nThe scheduling priority for selecting the divisions and developing the schools will \nbegin with the poorest DSDs in all provinces. \n\nA  minimum  of  five  type  3  schools  and  three  type  2  or  type  1C  schools  will  be \nwithin  the  specified  catchment  area.4  A  projection  of  the  student  population \nbased  on  demographic  data  combined  with  analysis  of  projected  student \nfuture \nincreases \nenrollment.  \n\nfeeder  schools  will \n\nindicate  positive \n\nincreases \n\nfrom \n\nin \n\nPriority  will  be  given  to  a  school  located  in  an  area  with  Sinhala  and  Tamil \nmedium  feeder  schools  in  the  catchment  area.  The  upgraded  school  will  be \nmultilingual.  The  proportion  for  equitable  distribution  of  school  development  per \nlanguage  of  instruction  will  be  determined  according  to  the  school  census  data \n(2006). \n\nAt least 6,000 children under 18 must reside in the catchment area.5  \n \nPresent enrollment in the school to be upgraded is a minimum of 250 students in \nthe primary grades (1\u20135) and 200 in junior secondary school (grades 6\u20139). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  National headcount index is the percentage of population living below the poverty line deemed appropriate for the \n\ncountry by its authorities. Currently, data does not include Northern Province.  \n\n2 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. 20 June 2005 (Available: www.statistics.gov.lk). \n3 Out of 25 districts, 5 districts are in Northern Province.  \n4  The catchment area is defined as a 10 kilometer radius (approximately 80 square kilometers) around the school.  \n5 National population census and school census data will be used as the basis of the analysis.  \n\n\fAppendix 5          37           \n\n    \n(viii)  Recruitment,  appointment,  and  deployment  of  the  school  principal  will  be  a \npublicly  announced  competition.  The  criteria  for  selecting  the  most  appropriate \ncandidate include:   \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\na  minimum  of  5  years  experience  as  principal  in  the  selected  school  for \nupgrading or in schools of similar capacity; \na  record  of  performance  as  principal  including  positive  references  to \nmanaging  teachers  and  nonteaching  staff;  overseeing  maintenance  and \nupkeep  of  school  buildings,  grounds,  and  equipment;  good  rapport  with \nstudents; and involvement of parents in school planning and activities; \na pattern of increased student enrollment in schools administered by the \nprincipal; \nimproved  student  performance  as  shown  through  pass  rates  in  school-\nbased assessments and in various exams; \npreparation  of  quality  school  development  plans  and  a  positive \nassessment of the results of plan implementation; and  \ndemonstrated competency in the allocation and use of school funds. \n\n(f) \n \nAccess roads to and from the school are suitable for year-round transportation by \ncar, bus or heavy delivery vehicle. \n  \nPublic transportation is available for students living more than 4 kilometers away \nfrom the selected school.   \n\nSufficient land and space is available for school expansion without disrupting the \nenvironment,  appropriation  of  adjacent  properties,  displacement  of  people,  or \nnegative effect on peoples\u2019 lives and livelihood. \n\nThe existing supply of potable water is sufficient to satisfy increased consumption \nor drilling a deep tube well to access a satisfactory water supply is possible.  \n\n  \n(xiii)  A system of wastewater treatment exists but may require upgrading. \n  \n(xiv)  An  adequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity  is  available  in  the  school  or  the \nsupply from power lines no more than 500 meters from the school buildings can \nbe upgraded.  \n\nTelephone service connection is available in the school or may be installed from \nlines and switch cabinet located within 500 meters of school buildings. \n\n \n(xvi)  The  school  should  have  existing  classrooms  made  available  or  other  space \n\nsuitable for conversion to science labs and activity rooms.   \n\n \n(xvii)  Library  facilities  with  a  minimum  collection  of  100  library  books  and  other \n\nmaterials exist.  \n\n \n(xviii)  A playground or sports field should exist.

The  committee  will \nconsult closely with the Ministry of Education. The identified school should obtain \nthe Divisional Development Committee clearance. \n\nfrom \n\nThe selection committee will prepare a report and recommendation for the school \nthat best matches the selection criteria. A summary explanation indicating how or \nwhy  the  selected  school  meets  the  selection  criteria  is  to  be  included  in  the \nwritten  report  and  recommendation.  A  map  of  the  DSD  showing  the  location  of \nthe  selected  school  and  the  location  of  all  other  schools  (including  tertiary \neducation institutions) in the catchment area will be attached. The map should be \nto scale or should otherwise indicate the distance in kilometers to feeder schools \nin the catchment area.     \n\nThe  divisional  secretary  must  endorse  the  recommendation  of  the  selection \ncommittee.  \n\nThe recommendation must be endorsed by the provincial director of education of \nthe provincial council.  \n\nThe recommendation may only be rejected by the Secretary of Education, of the \nMinistry of Education if the minimum criteria are not fully achieved. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6          39           \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND IX GRANT FOR HIV/AIDS HEALTH EDUCATION \n\nRationale  \n\nObjective  \n\n \nA. \n \nSri Lanka remains a country with  a low prevalence of HIV1 infection. However, several \n1. \nfactors increase vulnerability of the population to an impending epidemic. Successful prevention \nthrough improved knowledge, attitudes, and practices is a preventative approach to reduce risk \nof  infection and  disease.  Children  and  youth  are  among  the  most  vulnerable  and  at  the  same \ntime represent a captive audience to access health-related information. Furthermore, to realize \nthe full potential of the country\u2019s massive investment in education, schooling should ensure that \nthose who pass through the system acquire sufficient knowledge, skills, and attitudes to remain \nhealthy  and  productive  throughout  life.  The  HIV/AIDS  health  education  component  will \ncomplement previous and ongoing efforts of the Government and other development agencies \nproviding assistance in the health sector.   \n \n2. \nSystematic review of health education literature including evaluations and lessons from \ndeveloping countries has shown that the most effective programs are curriculum-based and led \nby adults. Reports on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted disease education indicate such \nprograms can be introduced and best achieved within a comprehensive school health promotion \nstrategy  that  establishes  a  foundation  for  understanding  the  relationships  between  personal \nbehavior and good health. The most effective programs take into consideration the physiological \nand emotional developmental levels of the different age groups and must be culturally sensitive \nand appropriate in delivery.   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  objective  of  the  HIV/AIDS  health  education  component  is  to  provide  adolescents \nand youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to adopt responsible, culturally acceptable, \nand safe reproductive behavior for a healthy and productive life. To achieve the objectives, the \nProject will design, develop, and introduce HIV/AIDS health education as an integral part of the \nsecondary  school  curriculum  and  co-curricular  activities  for  grades  6  to  11.  To  successfully \nimplement the revised curriculum, a minimum of 300 teacher educators at the National Colleges \nof Education (NCOE), teacher training colleges (TTC), and teacher centers (TC) will be the first \nof three beneficiary groups to be trained. The second group is approximately 6,000 teachers in \ntype 1AB, 1C, and type 2 schools. The third and ultimate target group will be all boys and girls \nstudying  in  grades  6\u201311.  Project  components  will  include  (i)  integration  of  HIV/AIDS  health \neducation  into  the  school  curriculum;  (ii)  learning  material  development  and  teacher  training, \nand (iii) teacher and student support.   \n \nC.  \n \n \n \n4. \nSeveral subjects in the curriculum are well suited to include knowledge about growth and \ndevelopment  of  children  as  they  enter  secondary  school.  Girls  and  boys  in  junior  secondary \nschool are at the appropriate developmental stage to learn about the importance of good health, \nappropriate  behavior,  personal  hygiene,  proper  nutrition,  and  community  health.  The  physical \nand  emotional  development  of  adolescents  brings  a  maturity  leading  to  subjects  such  as \nreproductive  health,  sexuality,  sexually  transmitted  disease,  HIV/AIDS,  drug  abuse,  and \n\nIntegration of HIV/AIDS Health Education into the School Curriculum \n\nProject Activities  \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1   HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f40          Appendix 6          \n\n2. \n\nInstructional Material Development and Teacher Training \n\naddiction.  In  addition  to  theoretical  content,  the  curriculum  should  include  skill  acquisition  and \ndevelopment  of  healthy  attitudes.  The  National Institute  of Education  (NIE)  will  be  responsible \nfor  integrating  HIV/AIDS  health  education  in  science  subjects,  health  and  physical  education, \nand  the  life  competencies  components  of  the  curriculum.  Two  national  workshops  will  be \norganized.  \n   \n5. \nThe  main  content  areas  or  themes  of  the  HIV/AIDS  health  education  component  will \nbuild  on  inputs  from  the  primary  school.  The  program  will  begin  in  grade  6  with  a  review  of \npersonal  health  and  hygiene,  and  understanding  of  environmental  influences  on  health.  In \nsubsequent  years,  the  topics  will  include  growth  and  development;  and  physiological, \npsychosocial,  and  psychological  changes  during  adolescence.  Threats  to  health  and  how  to \ncounter  the  risks  will  be  covered  in  topics  including  tobacco;  alcohol  and  drug  abuse; \nreproductive  health;  sexually  transmitted  disease;  HIV/AIDS;  knowledge  and  skills  for \nsafeguarding sexual and reproductive health; skills to adapt responsible, culturally acceptable, \nand safe reproductive behavior; biology of sexually transmitted disease; HIV infections; nature \nof the diseases; behaviors that facilitate transmission and increase the risk of infection; and the \nskills necessary to avoid behavior that exposes people to risks. The program will also promote \nattitudes of respect for human rights and compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS. Students \nwill  learn  skills  necessary  to  interact  with  people  living  with  disability  and  HIV/AIDS  in  a \nnondiscriminatory, considerate, and supportive way. \n \n \n \n6. \nInternational  and  domestic  HIV/AIDS  and  health  education  specialists  will  design  a \ntraining of trainers (TOT) program for 300 trainers from the 18 NCOEs, 10 TTCs, and 92 TCs. \nFour  hundred  sets  of  TOT  materials  will  be  provided  for  the  TOT  program.  The  TOT  program \nwill  develop  a  network  of  trainers  to  teach  6,000  secondary  school  teachers  and  to  serve  as \nresource  people  in  the  92  education  zones.  Six  thousand  and  five  hundred  sets  of  teacher \ntraining materials will be prepared for the training of teachers. Approximately 12 TOTs2 of 5-day \nduration will be conducted at NIE for NCOEs, TTCs, and TC personnel. An estimated 250 3-day \nprovincial  teacher  training  workshops  will  be  conducted  for  secondary  school  teachers.  The \nProject will provide instructional materials, cost of transportation, accommodation, and meals for \nthe  participants  to  attend  the  training  programs.  Ten  teachers  per  province  will  undertake  1 \nmonth  of  training  in  Asia  on  innovative  teaching  learning  for  HIV/AIDS  education.  Staff \ndevelopment program in Asia for 30 staff will be available.  \n \n \n \n7. \nAvailable  learning  materials  from  the  international  market  will  be  purchased  and  made \navailable  to  the  resource  centers.  Multimedia  learning  materials  for  classroom  use  will  be \nprepared  and  distributed  to  the  teachers.  To  provide  continuing  support  to  local  teachers  and \nstudents,  a resource  center  will  be identified in each  zone. The  existing  network  of TC  will  be \nthe  first  choice  for  locating  the  HIV/AIDS  health  education  zonal  resource  center.  Each  zonal \nresource center will be multipurpose to provide information to teachers, students, and parents. \nEach center will be equipped to accommodate two full-time staff and include a resource room \nwith  print  materials  and  a  minimum  of  two  computers  to  access  online  resources.  This \ncentralized service approach in each zone will be used to support the initiatives of other project \ncomponents  thus  increasing  utilization  rates  and  efficiency  of  existing  physical  and  human \n\nTeacher and Student Support \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n2   The maximum number of participants per workshop is 30. The same workshop will be repeated 12 times.   \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6          41           \n\nProject Implementation Arrangements  \n\nresources.  The  27  largest  TCs  will  be  equipped  with  multimedia  systems  such  as  digital \nprojectors, DVD players, and accessories.  \n  \n8. \nIn areas where a TC is not well located or otherwise not suitable as a resource center, a \nschool  or  alternate  facility  may  be  appropriate.  The  centers  should  be  accessible  to  students \nfrom physical and psychosocial perspectives. Learning resources at the center will supplement \nwhat is taught in class and will consist of printed materials as well as software. The center will \nalso have web-based facilities to enable students to anonymously ask and receive a response \nto  a  question.  Counseling,  especially  on  reproductive  health  matters,  will  be  made  available. \nServices of field health staff such as from the Ministry of Health will be available as needed, on \na call basis to strengthen the service provided through the center. \n  \nThe  Project  will  provide  civil  works  for  office  refurbishment  for  the  School  Health  and \n9. \nNutrition Unit of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the zonal resource centers; furniture and \nmultimedia  equipment  for  the  resource  centers;  international  and  local  training;  consultancy \nservices; and operating expenses, such as monitoring cost and communications.  \n        \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  School  Health  and  Nutrition  Unit  of  MOE  will  plan  and  coordinate  project \nimplementation,  with  the  assistance  of  national  and  international  consultants  in  HIV/AIDS \neducation. A technical committee comprising the education advisor of the Secondary Education \nModernization Project II; the Science, Health, and Physical Education Department of NIE; and \nthe Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health will serve as an advisory group to the MOE \nSchool Health and Nutrition Unit. The agencies involved in HIV/AIDS education will be invited to \njoin  the  technical  committee  meetings  as  required.  The  project  management  office  will  be \nresponsible for  all  procurement,  disbursement,  and  reporting.  MOE  will  design  and  maintain  a \nwebpage  for  the  Project  that  will  include  regular  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to \nincrease transparency, accountability, and efficiency of project implementation.   \n \nE. \n \nThe  School  Health  and  Nutrition  Unit  of  MOE  will  establish  monitoring  indicators  of \n11. \nproject  progress,  outcome,  and  impact  in  consultation  with  the  technical  committee.  The  core \ngroup of teacher educators in each zone will provide information for monitoring and evaluation. \nA  school  recognition  and  reward  system  based  on  objective  criteria  for  success  will  be \ndeveloped and schools with good performance will be recognized and acknowledged through a \npublic information campaign. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimate by Financier \n($ million) \n\nSri Lanka\nEducation for Knowledge Society Project\nDisbursement Accounts by Financiers\n($ Million)\n\n \n \n  Asian Development\n \n\nBank (Loan)\n%\n\nAmount\n\nAsian Development\nBank (Grant)\n%\n\nAmount\n\nGovernment of\nSri Lanka\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nAmount\n\n%\n\nTotal\n\nFor.\nExchange\n\n(Excluding Duties and\n\nTaxes)\n\nTaxes\n\nLocal\n\n A.

The quality and relevance goals of the Project reflect both learning and \nteaching perspectives. The Project will improve and modernize teaching facilities, especially in \ndisadvantaged  and  underserved  areas.  The  Project  also  pays  attention  to  health  education  to \nincrease  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS,1  emphasizing  the  importance  of  preventive  measures  to \ncontrol such diseases among the school population. Increases in secondary and tertiary school \nenrollment and completion rates are some of the measurable outcomes of the Project. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  address  issues  relevant  to  the  prevailing  economic  situation  in  the \ncountry  where  unemployment  among  secondary  school  leavers  remains  high.  The  Project \nrecognizes  that  this  problem  arises  from  a  combination  of  factors,  including  the  lack  of \nmarketable skills among school leavers, lack of appropriate training facilities, lack of access to \nteaching and learning in key subjects such as information and communication technology (ICT), \nand limited dissemination of information about labor market conditions and the knowledge and \nqualifications needed by employers. The economic  impact of the Project will arise through the \nhigher employability of school leavers after their exposure to educational and training programs \nsupported  by  the  Project.  These  education  and  training  programs  will  help  them  secure \nemployment with higher earnings as compared with school leavers currently entering the labor \nmarket with secondary and postsecondary education. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe need for the Project results from the inadequacies in the current education system, \nwhich  reflects  the  traditional  emphasis  of  the  education  system  and  public  preferences  for \nformal academic programs leading to university education. Despite the introduction of vocational \ntraining  in  the  early  1990s,  inadequacies  still  exist  in  terms  of  the  availability  of  market-driven \nskills, particularly among those entering the labor market for the first time. As a result, there is a \nmismatch between the skills demanded by the private sector and those acquired by secondary \nand  postsecondary  students.  This  problem  was  highlighted  in  The  National  ICT  Policy  in \nEducation (2001) and  Proposals for a National Policy Framework on General Education in Sri \nLanka (2003) prepared by the National Education Commission. The latter in particular highlights \nthe  dearth  of  graduates  qualified  in  science,  mathematics,  and  ICT.  The  2004\u20132005  Global \nCompetitiveness  Report  noted  that  inadequate  skills  and  quality  of  the  work  force  was  one  of \nthe constraints to developing business in Sri Lanka.2  \n \nMost of the demand for the Project comes from the formal and informal private sector, \n4. \nwhich employs 90% of the labor force. Demand for skilled secondary and postsecondary school \nleavers is increasing (Supplementary Appendix C). Given the major emphasis of the Project on \nimproving  English  language  and  ICT  skills,  secondary  and  tertiary  graduates  will  be  more \nreadily  employable  as  their  skills  will  more  closely  match  labor  demand  in  the  private  sector. \nThe improved employability of these graduates will also facilitate the adoption of new industrial \nprocesses  and  technologies  and  product  diversification.  While  the  Project  will  significantly \n\nProject Demand \n\n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n2   Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka.  2005.  Promoting  Competitiveness  in  Sri  Lanka.  News  Survey,  Vol.  26,  No.  1 \n\n(January\u2212March). \n\n \n\n\f52         Appendix 11 \n\n \n\nimprove the skills of the young labor force, school leavers interested in self-employment will also \nbe better equipped to start new enterprises relevant to both local and international markets. \n \nC. \n \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nEfficiency in the Job Market \n\n \n5. \nAs  analyzed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  unemployment  among  graduates  with \nsecondary and postsecondary education is high, particularly for those aged 15\u201329 years. At the \nsame time, labor demand is high for skilled school leavers with relevant knowledge and skills, \nespecially  in  manufacturing,  construction,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  transport,  storage  and \ncommunication, banking and finance, real estate, and community development. \n \n6. \nThe gaps that exist in labor supply in relation to demand suggest that the lack of relevant \nskills influences unemployment more than the lack of employment opportunities. The economy \ncurrently  generates  around  200,000  new  jobs  per  year,  45%  of  which  are  filled  by  employees \nwith secondary and postsecondary education. However, most of these jobs are at the minimum \nwage.  The  2005  labor  market  survey  carried  out  in  connection  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank-assisted  Human  Resource  Investment  Project3  estimated  the  shortfall  in  semiskilled  and \nskilled labor to be around 122,000 jobs by the end of 2007. Accordingly, the Project will focus on \nfilling the gap at higher technical levels in areas of high economic demand. \n \n7. \nEmployers will benefit from recruiting new employees with improved skills. Industrialists \nin  particular  will  be  willing  to  hire  graduates  with  generic skills,  as  they  are  more  adaptable  to \nlearning the additional skills needed by specific industries. The availability of a labor force with \nmore  suitable  work  skills  will  also  help  the  private  sector  to  avoid  some  of  the  difficulties \nencountered due to the Government\u2019s very strict labor regulations.4 \n \nDifferent  wages  are  offered  within  the  same  occupational  group  depending  on \n8. \nqualifications and experience. Accordingly, it is expected that school leavers with qualifications \nprovided by the Project will receive a higher wage than at present. In addition, they can move \nfurther and reach higher wage levels after successfully completing the job training provided by \nprivate sector institutions. The additional skills acquired through the Project will also help those \nwho are self-employed. \n \n\n2. \n\nIncreased Efficiency of the Education System  \n\n \n9. \nThe Project will significantly improve the quality and relevance of secondary and tertiary \neducation  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  Project  will  upgrade  150  provincially  administered  schools, \nparticularly  in  disadvantaged  areas,  and  will  also  provide  scholarships  to  deserving  students. \nThese  two  activities  will  encourage  students  to  continue  their  education  beyond  primary  level \nand will contribute to higher retention among school children at all levels. \n \n10. \nImproving  the  efficiency,  quality  and  relevance  of  education  fundamentally  depends  on \nhaving  teachers  who  are  capable  of  meeting  that  challenge.  Accordingly,  the  Project  will \ndevelop  skills  of  teachers  at  secondary  and  tertiary  levels  through  professional  training  in  ICT \nand  communication  skills.  In  order  to  support  this,  the  Project  also  emphasizes  the  need  to \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB.2007. Preparing the Human Resource Investment Project. Manila  \n4   These regulations reduce the ability of the private sector to terminate the services of employees on the grounds of \n\ninefficiency. \n\n\fAppendix 11         53 \n\nrevise curricula to reflect the changing needs of secondary education, and to develop teaching \nmaterials and text books accordingly. \n \n11. \nThe Project will promote knowledge-based development by upgrading tertiary education \nand  teacher  training  institutions,  including  those  responsible  for  developing  curriculum  and \nteacher  guides.  The  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  and  make  teachers  aware  of \nmodern  teaching  methodologies,  leading  to  more  relevant  programs  reflecting  the  needs  of  a \nmodern economy. \n \n12. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  health  education  program  will  considerably  reduce  the  cost  of  fighting \nHIV/AIDS  in  the  future.  Although  Sri  Lanka  has  relatively  low  prevalence  of  HIV  infection  in \ncomparison  with  other  developing  nations,  the  potential  significance  of  the  problem  cannot  be \nignored.  In  countries  where  HIV  infection  has  reached  epidemic  proportions,  there  have  been \nheavy economic and social costs due to treatment costs, premature death, loss of employment \nand income, and disintegration of families. \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n \n13. \nAnother  contribution  of  the  Project  will  be  to  reduce  regional  disparity  and  poverty. \nDespite the impressive performance of the economy in recent years, with 5.5% growth in 2004, \n6.3% in 2005 and 7.4% in 2006, Sri Lanka is characterized by significant regional disparities in \ndevelopment, income distribution, and poverty. The Western Province, which accounts for 28% \nof  the  total  population,  has  the  highest  concentration  of  industrial  activities  and  services.  This \nprovince  accounted  for  nearly  50%  of  Gross  Domestic  Product  in  2003,  including  more  than \n60%  of  industrial  output  and  nearly  60%  of  services  output.  All  other  provinces  play  a  very \nlimited role in industrial production and services. \n \n14. \nSuccessive Governments have tried to encourage investment in regions other than the \nWestern  Province  in  order  to  bring  about  more  equitable  economic  growth  and  create  more \nemployment  opportunities.  However,  these  efforts  have  been  constrained  by  the  relatively \nlimited  infrastructure  facilities  and  supply  shortages  of  skilled  and  semi-skilled  labor.  Although \nthe  Project  will  not  remedy  all  the  problems  underlying  regional  disparity,  the  availability  of  a \nmore productive labor force with relevant skills will be an important factor to attract investment \nto the provinces for expanded industrial activities. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nAs  the  Project  does  not  directly  generate  income,  the  key  to  sustaining  the  Project \nbenefits  will  be  the  budgetary  allocation  to  cover  expenditures  beyond  the  implementation \nphase. The annual financial requirement to sustain the Project is estimated to be around $4-5 \nmillion. This will account for about 4-5% of the present recurrent budget in the education sector. \nThe  Government  has  a  strong  incentive  and  commitment  to  allocate  sufficient  funds.  The \nincentive  comes  from  the  benefits  of  the  Project  in  terms  of  faster  growth  and  more  equitable \nemployment  and  income  generation  for  secondary  and  postsecondary  graduates  in  both \ndomestic and international markets. Recognizing these broad economic and social benefits, the \nGovernment  has  assured  as  a  condition  for  ADB  financing  that  throughout  the  Project\u2019s \nimplementation and after Project completion, sufficient funds will be allocated from its budget to \noperate and maintain the improved schools and their facilities, and to pay salaries of teachers, \nprincipals,  and  support  staff.  Furthermore,  cost-recovery  measures  and  business  plans  have \nbeen developed for the upgrading of the institutions supported under the Project. \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\n\f54          Appendix 12         \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in the country poverty analysis?  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n\nThe goal of the Education for Knowledge Society Project (EKSP) is to increase access to quality secondary schooling \nand a variety of tertiary education programs relevant to the diverse needs of the learners, their communities, and the \nnation.  The  goal  will  be  achieved  by  increasing  enrollment,  retention,  and  completion  rates  of  youth  in  secondary \nschools and tertiary education particularly in rural and disadvantaged locations. The Project is designed to better suit \nthe needs of the majority of  students  who  exit the general education system rather than continuing on to  university. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  teacher  development  with  greater  application  of  knowledge  through  activity-based \nteaching, team work, effective communication, problem solving, and critical thinking. The Project\u2019s focus of increasing \nretention and completion rates in secondary schools combined  with the geographic and social economic attention to \nrural  and  remote  communities  (including  plantations)  will  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  low  income  families. \nThe selection of 150 schools to be upgraded through the Project supports the development of smaller communities. \nOne of the criteria for school selection is low ranking on the poverty index of all divisional secretariat divisions in Sri \nLanka.  The  poorest  150  divisions  will  be  identified.  Further  scrutiny  of  schools  selected  for  upgrading  will  be \nundertaken  during  project  implementation.  The  convergence  of  factors  such  as  the  recent  change  to  competency-\nbased education curriculum and teaching methodology, the introduction of practical subjects in junior secondary and \ntechnical subjects in senior secondary, greater access to computers, and more opportunities to learn sciences should \nimprove schooling for all students and particularly those in disadvantaged areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB. \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nApproximately  25%  of  the  population  of  Sri  Lanka  experience  absolute  poverty.  The  incidence  of  poverty  varies \nsignificantly  by  province.  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  are  the  poorest  areas  largely  due  to  a  quarter  century  of \narmed conflict. Uva Province and North Central Province rank third and fourth poorest. Income poverty is primarily a \nrural phenomenon with about 85% of poor households located in rural areas. The poor suffer mostly from low quality \nsocial services. Access to social facilities is generally broad, but education outcomes of the poor are well below the \nnational  average.  The  benefits  of  growth  in  the  richer  provinces  and  the  nation  generally  are  not  being  distributed \nevenly throughout the country. Economic development has tended to benefit Western Province with only about 10% of \nthe population largely bypassing the rural areas that account for 80% of the population.   \n\nImpact of Poverty on Education  \nThe impact of poverty on education is reduced somewhat by government programs to provide free uniforms, books, \nand in needy situations midday meals. International donor agencies such as the World Food Program distribute food \nand  assist  in  the  construction  and  operation  of  kitchen  facilities  in  schools  in  the  poorest  areas.  Basic  education  is \navailable to all, but quality public education is accessible mainly to the wealthy. Low quality education is provided in \npoor and vulnerable areas. Few students from poor areas manage to pass A-level examinations. Thus, the education \nsystem  reinforces  inequality.  An  array  of  causes  explains  the  pervasive  low  quality,  including  teacher  absenteeism, \nlack  of  teacher  accountability,  poor  and  incomplete  facilities,  and  lack  of  access  to  English  language  instruction \nparticularly  in  rural  areas.  Continued  heavy  reliance  on  O-  and  A-level  examinations,  as  the  standard  of  student \nassessment, places additional burden on all families especially the poor.  \n\nHistorically, equitable access to education has been a prime consideration in formulating education policy in Sri Lanka. \nThe  introduction  of  free  education,  and  establishment  of  central  schools  and  the  many  student  welfare  measures  to \npromote  participation  have  been  successful  particularly  for  primary  education.  However,  a  disturbing  trend  in  the \nschool system has led to the decline and closure of some rural schools as parents are lured to send their children to \nthe more popular urban schools. In the past 10 years, this trend has escalated resulting in the growth of megaschools. \nThis has been described as the bipolarization of the school system. The number of schools with an enrollment of less \nthan 100 students has increased to 2,873, while 75 schools now have an enrollment of more than 3,000.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12          55           \n\n \nThe  significant  impact  of  the  migration  to  larger  schools  includes  a  strain  on  the  transport  system  as  the  flow  of \nstudents  from  rural  areas  to  urban  centers  occurs  daily;  the  physical  and  mental  development  of  children  spending \nlong hours in vehicles and away from their homes; increased competition among parents to get their children admitted \nto  prestigious  schools  and  their  resorting  to  fraudulent  means,  which  breeds  corruption  in  the  school  admission \nprocess; and decline in the standards of discipline in large urban schools as they become unmanageable. In addition \nto these negative effects of popular schools, the Ministry of Education(MOE) and its officers and provincial authorities \ndevote  considerable  time  dealing  with  school  admission  issues  rather  than  focusing  on  improving  quality.  The \ndistortion of policy ensuring equal education opportunities for all has led to better-off students (20%) having increased \naccess to quality education while the children (80%) in poor and remote areas are becoming more disadvantaged. In \nsummary, the present education system is failing the majority, thus causing the poor to fail in such a system.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Constitution of 1978 guarantees equal rights without discrimination on the basis of sex; universal franchise  was \ngranted  in  1931.  Sri  Lanka  ratified  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  in  1981.  Equal \naccess is provided to free education and health services (introduced in the 1940s). Women have equal rights under \nthe  general  law  but  face  discrimination  in  the  personal  laws  of  the  different  communities  in  the  country.  Despite \nconstitutional  and  legal  provisions  and  positive  social  policies  for  many  decades,  women  lag  behind  men  in  many \nrespects.  Universal  franchise  and  free  education  has  not  led  to  equal  participation  of  women  in  politics  and \ngovernance. Female representation in the parliament and local government is abysmally low, demonstrating women\u2019s \nunequal  access  to  decision-making.  While  free  education  led  to  gender  equality  in  access  to  education,  patriarchal \nvalues  and  cultural  norms  and  attitudes  contribute  to  gender  stereotyped  subject  choices  in  secondary  and  tertiary \neducation, and in technical and vocational training. These  factors limit  women\u2019s marketability, constrain employment \nopportunities,  and  reinforce  gender-based  divisions  in  the  labor  market.  For  the  past  few  decades,  the  female \nunemployment  rate  has  been  double  that  of  males.  Persistent  poverty,  ethnicity  and  caste  factors,  uneven  \ndevelopment  in  certain  regions,  and  lack  of  infrastructure  and  access  to  services  and  facilities  contribute  further  to \ngender disparity. The two-decade war and the tsunami in 2004 have compounded the situation of gender inequality.   \n \nThe  gender  strategy  supports  EKSPs\u2019  goal  to  increase  access  to  and  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  secondary \neducation and tertiary education through better governance and service delivery to suit the needs and aspirations of \nstudents.  The  Project  will  focus  on  youth  who  may  opt  for  nonuniversity  tertiary  education  to  equip  them  with \nemployable  skills  to  find  suitable  employment.  Quality  improvement  in  secondary  education  and  its  delivery  in  the \ndifficult  areas  will  offer  disadvantaged  girls,  especially  in  the  rural  and  plantation  areas,  access  to  science  and \ntechnical  education  to  improve  employability  at  that  level  or  acquire  necessary  competencies  through  tertiary \neducation  to  suit  labor  market  demands.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  eliminate  stereotyped  perceptions  of  girls\u2019 \neducation, subject choices, and job preferences dictated by the norms of rural society.   \n \nThe  gender  strategy  will  be  implemented  by  the  MOE,  Ministry  of  Higher  Education,  National  Institute  of  Education, \nprovincial ministries of education, schools, and other relevant education institutions based on areas of responsibility. \nThese  agencies  will  allocate  required  financial  and  human  resources  to  implement  this  plan  in  the  course  of \nimplementing the Project. The Project will practice a policy of affirmative action in hiring staff and consultants. Females \nwill  comprise  40%  of  the  managerial  staff  for  the  Project.  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies/units  will  be \nstrengthened  through  training  and  consultants/consulting  agency  services.  Project  management  staff  will  have \nexpertise in social development and gender and development. The Project will recruit a part-time gender consultant to \nmanage  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  will  include \ngender-disaggregated targets and indicators. The Project will develop and maintain a gender-disaggregated database \nfor benefit monitoring and evaluation. Reporting mechanisms will include both quantitative and qualitative information \nand will reflect the elements of the gender strategy.   \n \nGender issues will be addressed through the following strategies: \n \n\n1.  Female teachers will comprise at least 50% of the teachers trained by EKSP. \n2.  A gender sensitization component will be included in teacher training curricula and teachers will be trained to \n\nencourage girls to take science and technical subjects in school. \n\n3.  Female teachers will make up 50% of teachers selected to follow programs for professional development of \n\nschool principals and education officers. \n\n \n\n\f56          Appendix 12         \n \n\n4.  Gender equality modules will be introduced in life competency programs in secondary schools. \n5.  The scholarship program will give priority to girls who opt to follow technical courses. \n6.  Textbooks  promoting  ideals  of  gender  equality,  with  examples  of  strong  female  role  models,  will  be \n\ndeveloped when school curricula are reviewed and revised.  \n\n7.  The gender-specific needs of female youth in rural, plantation, and conflict-affected areas will be addressed \n\nwhen redesigning Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological Education courses. \n\n8.  Girls will be encouraged through career guidance and social marketing to follow technical courses. \n9.  Media campaigns will be designed and conducted to change stereotype perceptions of male preference and \n\nmale competency in following technical courses.  \n\n10.  Community women\u2019s groups will be encouraged to apply, through school development societies, to the Fund \n\nfor Innovative ICT in Education for projects on self-employment.  \n\n11.  A  component  on  gender  and  HIV/AIDS  will  be  included  in  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training  and \n\nschool curricula. \n\n12.  General,  higher  education,  technical  education  and  vocational  training  sector  policy  dialogue  will  address \ncurrent  issues  of  gender  inequality  in  education,  skill  training,  employment  opportunity,  career  choice,  and \nadvancement. \n\n13.  Female teachers will be appointed to provide career guidance for female youth.  \n14.  The teachers engaged in career guidance will be trained in a rights-based approach to help change gender-\n\nstereotype perceptions in career selection. \n\n15.  The  social  marketing  strategy  for  EKSP  will  focus  on  changing  societal  attitudes  to  enrollment  in \n\ntechnological fields and removing misconceptions about subject choices for boys and girls. \n\n16.  Equal numbers of women and men from the MOE and provincial education authorities will be trained in social \nmarketing and information campaigns to convey messages through social marketing for attitudinal changes \namong policy makers, private sector, and other relevant groups. \n\n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nE.

In the event \nland acquisition is required, the resettlement framework \n(Supplementary Appendix D) will be followed. \n \n\nThe Project will provide equal access to project benefits to \nall ethnic groups. Thus, the Project will have a positive \nimpact on ethnic minorities. An Ethnic Equity Framework \nwas prepared (Appendix 13).   \n\nThe peace and security situation remains fragile.

The expected \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  the  improved  quality,  relevance,  efficiency,  and  equity  of  access  to \nsecondary and tertiary education The Project will particularly aim at providing employable skills \nto  those  who  may  not  enter  universities,  but  rather  seek  nonuniversity  tertiary  education \nopportunities.  Children  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  and  economically  and  socially  isolated \nregions including the plantation communities will benefit from the Project. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe population of Sri Lanka in the year 2000 was estimated at 18.7 million. The Sinhala \npopulation constitutes 74%, while Tamils and Muslims represent 18% and 7%, respectively. The \nconflict  between  the  Tamil  militant  groups  and  the  Government  continued  for  20  years.  The \nwhole  country  has  suffered  from  the  conflict.  The  constitutional  provisions  to  meet  the \naspirations of ethnic minorities are found in articles dealing with fundamental rights, proportional \nrepresentation,  language  policy,  and  devolution.  The  13th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution \ndeclared that Sinhalese and Tamil languages shall be official languages. English is declared to \nbe the link language. The 16th Amendment passed in 1988 declared that Sinhala and Tamil be \nthe languages of administration and language of the courts throughout Sri Lanka. \n \n \nC. \n \nThe ethnic equity framework is developed to ensure that all ethnic groups in the project \n3. \nareas  have  equal  access  to  project  benefits.  Central  and  provincial  education  authorities  will \nplan and implement project components according to project implementation arrangements for \nvarious administrative levels in the education sector. The Project gives priority to students from \neconomically deprived and conflict-affected areas. The prevailing political and security contexts \nmust be taken into account and measures taken to ensure that objectives and activities will not \nbe compromised by the project environment. \n \n\nProject Components to Ensure Equity in Quality Education for All Ethnic Groups  \n\n \n\n\fTable A13:  Project Interventions and Actions to Ensure Ethnic Equity Benefit \n \n\n58          Appendix 13         \n\n \n\nProject Interventions \nUpgrade  150  provincial  type  C  and  type  2  schools \nlocated  in  the  poorest  divisional  secretary  divisions \n(DSD)  by  providing  resources  and  facilities  to  improve \nfrom \ncompetency-based  education \ngrades  6\u221213,  and  in  particularly  science  and  technical \nsubjects  in  grades  10\u221213.

Other  available  poverty  data  will  be  used  for \nthe  selection  of  DSDs  from  the  Northern  Province. \nApproximately six schools will be selected in each of the \ndistricts including the Northern Province. \n2.  The  selection  of  the  schools  will  follow  the  agreed \ncriteria (Appendix 5)  \n3.  Priority will be given to schools located in areas where \nthere  are  Sinhala  and  Tamil  medium  feeder  schools.  \nThese schools should be multilingual.   \n4.  The  Project  midterm  review  progress  report  will \ninclude  a  review  of  student  populations  of  the  upgraded \nschools  (including  the  feeder  schools)  and  will  suggest \nremedial  measures \nif  ethnic  equity  has  not  been \nmaintained.   \n1. Criteria for identifying eligible students and families will \nbe established using household poverty indicators.  \n2.  The  impact  and  tracer  study  of  the  scholarship \nprogram will include a comparative analysis per ethnicity \nand gender.  \n \n1.  Proportion  of  schools  per  medium  of  instruction  will \nfollow the School Census data (2006)   \n\n1.  The  advanced  technology  institutes  (ATIs)  located  in \nJaffna,  Trincomalee,  Amparai,  Dehiwala,  and  Kandy \nconduct  courses  in  the  Sinhala  and  Tamil  medium  and \nthe ATI Kandy caters to students including the plantation \nsector population. \n1. An affirmative action is taken to address weakness in \nEnglish teaching as well as shortage of English teachers \nin Tamil medium schools.

The \nProject  has  built  maximum  flexibility  in  its  implementation  so  that  children  in  those  areas  do  not \nremain  excluded  from  the  benefits  of  modern  knowledge  and  technologies.  For  instance,  for  the \nupgrading of secondary schools, if in any given year selected schools from the Northern Province  \ncannot  be  upgraded  due  to  security  concerns,  those  schools  will  be  replaced  in  that  year  with \nschools  from  another  area,  but  the  overall  project  quota  for  schools  to  be  upgraded  from  the \nNorthern Province will not change. \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "\u2013 \nADB \n\u2013 \nADF \n\u2013 \nATI  \n\u2013 \nCAPE \n\u2013 \nCBE \n\u2013 \nCEIEE \n\u2013 \nCELD  \n\u2013 \nDEMP \n\u2013 \nDSD \n\u2013 \nESDFP \n\u2013 \nHND  \nHIV/ AIDS   \u2013 \n\u2013 \nICT \n\u2013 \nIIIL \n\u2013 \nJBIC \n\u2013 \nMHE  \n\u2013 \nMIS  \n\u2013 \nMOE  \n\u2013 \nMVTT  \n\u2013 \nNAITA  \n\u2013 \nNCB \n\u2013 \nNCOE  \n\u2013 \nND  \n\u2013 \nNETS  \n\u2013 \nNGO \n\u2013 \nNIE \n\u2013 \nOUSL \n\u2013 \nPME  \n\u2013 \nPMO  \n\u2013 \nPPP \n\u2013 \nPSC  \n\u2013 \nSBA \n\u2013 \nSBM \n\u2013 \nSEMP  \n\u2013 \nSEMP II \n\u2013 \nSLIATE \n\u2013 \nSOE \n\u2013 \nTEDP \n\u2013 \nTC  \n\u2013 \nTEVT \n\u2013 \nTOT \n\u2013 \nTTC \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Sri Lankan rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0090192  \nSLRs110.86 \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nadvanced technological institute \ncountry assistance program evaluation \ncompetency-based education \nCenter of Excellence in English Education  \nCenter for Education Leadership Development \nDistance Education Modernization Project \ndivisional secretary divisions \nEducation Sector Development Framework and Program \nhigh national diploma \nhuman immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \ninformation and communication technology \nInitiative for Innovative ICT for Learning \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nMinistry of Higher Education \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Education \nMinistry of Vocational and Technical Training \nNational Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority \nNational Competitive Bidding \nNational College of Education \nnational diploma \nNational Education Testing Services \nnongovernment organization \nNational Institute of Education \nOpen University of Sri Lanka \nprovincial ministries of education \nproject management office \npublic-private partnerships \nproject steering committee \nschool-based assessment \nschool-based management \nSecondary Education Modernization Project \nSecondary Education Modernization Project II \nSri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological Education \nStatement of Expenditure \nTechnical Education Development Project \nTeacher Center \ntechnical education and vocational training \ntraining of trainers \nTeacher Training College \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", " \n", "L.
