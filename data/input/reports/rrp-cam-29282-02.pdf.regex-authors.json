The Project will upgrade \nthe  water  supply  systems  in  six  provincial  towns,  develop  a \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  in  Sihanoukville, \nimprove community sanitation conditions in selected communities, \nand help mobilize resources at the local government level.  \n   \nRationale  Water supply systems and environmental sanitation in provincial \ntowns deteriorated severely during the 1970s and 1980s because \nof war, ineffectual management, and lack of maintenance. The \nrapid  population  increase  in  urban  centers  has  aggravated  the \nsituation. Inadequate potable water supply and sanitation systems \nhave  resulted  in  deteriorating  environment  and  public  health \nconditions in the urban centers. Almost 20% of children die before \nreaching the age of five, and waterborne diseases account for \nabout 30% of hospitalizations. \n \nCambodia\u2019s provincial towns serve as economic centers for the \nrural areas and link the country's rural and urban economies. The \ntowns  are  the  immediate  markets,  transportation  depots,  and \nprocessing  centers  for  agricultural  products  in  the  provinces. \nImproving urban services, including water supply and sanitation, \nin the provincial towns will contribute to poverty reduction in both \nrural  and  urban  areas.  It  will  also  complement  other  social \ndevelopment programs such as primary health. In addition, the \ndevelopment  of  provincial  towns  will  help  absorb  the  rural \nmigrants  and  reduce  pressures  on  the  urban  environment, \ninfrastructure, and employment in the capital city of Phnom Penh. \nThe Project is expected to bring about long-term positive social and \nenvironmental impacts. \n   ", "iv \nObjectives   The Project is expected to improve basic urban services, public \nhealth, and the urban environment in seven towns: Battambang, \nKampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, Sihanoukville, \nand Svay Rieng. The Project was developed on the basis of \nsocioeconomic  surveys  and  extensive  consultation  with  the \ncentral  and  provincial  governments,  local  communities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  potential  beneficiaries.  The \nProject consists of five parts. \n \nPart  A:  Community  sanitation  and  health  awareness. \nSanitation conditions in the poor communities in the Project towns \nwill be improved through community education and participation in \nsubproject design, cost sharing, and operation and maintenance. \nAbout 3,500 households in the Project towns will benefit from the \nprogram.  \n \nPart B: Water supply.  Water supply in Battambang, Kampot, \nKompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay Rieng will be \nimproved. The subprojects will involve the provision, upgrading, or \nrehabilitation of the facilities for water intake and production, and \nreplacement and extension of the reticulation networks.  \n \nPart  C:  Wastewater  management.  A sewage collection and \ntreatment system with a capacity of 5,700 cubic meters per day \nwill be designed and constructed in Sihanoukville. \n \nPart  D:  Local  governance  and  resource  mobilization.  The \nessential structure for urban local governance will be studied and \nrevenues at the local level improved.  \n \nPart E: Implementation assistance. The assistance will cover: \n(i) consulting services for community development, engineering \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  project  management \nsupport; (ii) project administration equipment and facilities; and (iii) \ntraining.  \n \nCost Estimates  The cost of the approved Project was estimated at $26.3 million \nequivalent, including $18.3 million in foreign exchange and $8.0 \nmillion equivalent in local currency. The reappraised cost of the \nProject  is  estimated  at  $34.6  million  equivalent,  consisting  of \n$23.6 million in foreign exchange, and $11.0 million equivalent in \nlocal  currency.  The  cost  increase  is  $8.2  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $5.2  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $3  million \nequivalent in local currency. \n \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \n  supplementary loan of $6.3 million to cover 76% of the estimated \ncost increase, with the balance to be covered by the Government \nof Cambodia. The financing plan for the original loan is as follows: \n ", "v \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Costs \nAsian Development Bank  18.17  1.83  20.00  76.0 \nAsian Development Assistance Facility  0.13  0.10  0.23  0.9 \nGovernment  0.00  5.87  5.87  22.3 \nLocal Communities  0.00  0.20  0.20  0.8 \n  Total  18.30  8.00  26.30  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  equivalent  of  SDR14,533,000  ($20.0  million)  has  been \nprovided  in  various  currencies  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and with an  interest rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The equivalent of \nSDR4,546,000  ($6.3  million)  will  be  provided  under  the \nproposed supplementary loan, with the same terms as those of \nthe original loan. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2006   \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2005 \nCompletion Date   \n \nImplementation  Project management units (PMUs) established at the Ministry of \nArrangements  Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and the Ministry of Public \nWorks  and  Transport  (MPWT)  are  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the Project. A project implementation unit has \nbeen  set  up  in  each  project  town  to  be  supervised  and \ncoordinated  by  the  two  PMUs.  An  urban  management \ncommittee has been established in the towns where project \nactivities need coordination. \n   \nExecuting Agency  MIME for parts A and B, and MPWT for parts C and D. Both \nagencies will implement their respective components of part E. \n \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nCivil works and supply contracts estimated to cost more than $1 \nmillion and $0.5 million, respectively, will be carried out under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Minor  civil  works \ncontracts under part A will  be procured under local competitive \nbidding.  Equipment  and  vehicles  will  be  procured  under \ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000 or less, and direct purchase procedures for contracts \nvalued at $100,000 or less. Funds from the supplementary loan \nwill be used to finance two civil works contracts: one for water \nsupply in two towns, and one for Alternate 3 balance of works \nfor the Sihanoukville wastewater management system. The civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  the  winning  bidders, \nselected following ICB procedures under the approved Project, \nthrough direct negotiations.  \n ", "vi \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  financed  by  ADB  were  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic consultants. A total of 340 (128 international and 212 \ndomestic)  person-months  of  consulting  services  were \nenvisaged  under  the  original  loan  for  engineering  design, \nconstruction  supervision,  community  development,  local \nresource  mobilization,  and  project  management  assistance. \nAdditional 33 (13 international and 20 domestic) person-months \nof consulting services will be required to cover the extended \nperiod of construction supervision.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit about 350,000 people, about 30% of \nBeneficiaries  whom  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Corresponding  benefits \ninclude time and cost savings from buying, fetching, treating, \nand  storing  water;  improved  public  and  family  hygiene and \nhealth;  reduced  medical  outlays;  increased  productive  days; \nand more employment opportunities. \n   \n \n \n \n \n ", "v\n  ii ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Towns Improvement Project. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  In 1995, the Government of Cambodia requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nassistance in rehabilitating the water supply and sanitation facilities in the major urban centers \nof the country. ADB approved project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to the Government \nin November 1996 to help prepare a feasibility study of an urban development project suitable \nfor  ADB  financing.  The  feasibility  study  was  carried  out  in  1997.2  Based  on  the \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and findings of ADB loan processing missions in 1999, \nADB approved Loan 1725-CAM(SF): Provincial Towns Improvement Project for $20 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund on 17 December 1999. The Loan Agreement \nwas signed on 2 February 2000 and the loan was declared effective on 11 April 2000. The \nProject envisaged an implementation period of 5.5 years, with an estimated project completion \ndate of 30 June 2005, and a loan closing date of 31 December 2005.  \n \n3.  In January and March 2003, the Government, realizing a significant cost overrun of the \nProject, requested ADB to provide a supplementary loan to cover the additional cost of the \nProject. The Government informed ADB that, due to fiscal constraints, it could not finance the \ncost overrun from its own resources, and that it had contacted other development agencies for \nassistance but no resources with a suitable time frame were available. The Government further \nconfirmed that water supply, sanitation, and environmental protection were priority development \nareas of the Government and the Project continued to be accorded development priority. Based \non  the  request,  ADB  fielded  a  supplementary  Loan  Reconnaissance  Mission  in  January\u2013\nFebruary  2003,  and  a  Reappraisal  Mission  in  July  2003.  The  missions  reviewed  the \nmacroeconomic situation of the country, implementation status of the Project, and technical, \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  social,  and  institutional  aspects  of  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan; and reached an understanding with Government agencies concerned on \nkey parameters of the proposed supplementary loan. A project framework is presented in \nAppendix 1. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Economic Growth, Urbanization, and Poverty \n4.  In  the  1990s,  Cambodia  was  transformed  from  an  agricultural  economy  to  one \ndominated  by  industry  and  services.  During  1990-2000,  the  share  of  agriculture  in  gross \ndomestic product declined from about 51% to 38%, while the share of industry and services \nincreased from 49% to 62%. Along with the economic transformation, rapid urbanization took \nplace. The urban population growth rate peaked to 8.4% in the early 1990s before it declined to \nabout 4% per annum. It is projected that up to 2005, the urban population will grow at an annual \nrate of around 3.4%, compared with a national average growth rate of about 2.5%. The rapid \nincrease of the urban population and dilapidated urban infrastructure, resulting from destruction \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for the Integrated Urban Development Project. Manila. \n2  The fragile coalition government eventually broke up in July 1997. As a result, ADB suspended its operations in the \ncountry till the new government was established after the general election in July 1998. ", "2 \nand negligence during the 1970s and 1980s, have caused the urban environment and public \nhealth, particularly among the urban poor, to deteriorate.  \n \n5.  Poverty  is  pervasive  in  Cambodia.  Calculating  the  cost  of  food  and  nonfood \nrequirements in Cambodia in 1997, the Government estimated the overall poverty line to be \nKR1,407 ($0.36) per capita per day in urban areas other than Phnom Penh. About 30% of the \nurban population in the provincial towns were living below the poverty line. One characteristic of \nCambodian  urban  poverty  is  lack  of  access  to  basic  services  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation. \n \nB.  Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation \n6.  Most urban centers suffer from poor water supply and sanitation. Only 8.5% of the \nhouseholds in the provincial towns have access to private or public tap water, and 58% of the \npeople living in the provincial towns draw water from unprotected sources. About 58% of the \nhouseholds living in these towns do not have access to any sanitation facilities. The cost of \npurchasing, treating, and storing water; the medical expenses for waterborne diseases; and lost \nproductive time due to water fetching or illness are much higher to the poor as a percentage of \ntheir incomes. The socioeconomic survey conducted during the feasibility study of the Project \nindicates that in the project towns residents without house connections pay 2.5\u20134 times higher \nfor water than those with house connections.  \n \n7.  The water supply systems in most of the urban centers were built in the 1920s and \n1930s,  and  their  production  capacity  can  no  longer  meet  the  demand  of  today's  urban \npopulation. The treatment plants have fallen into disuse, the distribution systems are in disrepair \nwith average leakage rates of around 60%, and lack of pressure in the pipelines has allowed \npolluted groundwater to enter the water supply systems.  Insufficient production capacities, \nleaking distribution networks, and intermittent power supply limit water supply in most towns to a \nfew hours per day and to limited areas only. Major urban centers have combined stormwater \nand sewage drainage systems, which were constructed during the same period as those of the \nwater supply. The systems have no treatment facilities and were basically designed to drain \nonly the commercial and market areas of towns. Untreated sewage flows into nearby rivers and \nwater bodies and polluted the environment. The haphazard dumping of solid waste into the \ndrainage systems blocked the pipes and collection manholes.  \n \nC.  Government Policies and Plans \n8.  The Government stated in its first 5-year Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP), \n1996\u20132000, that the primary objectives of its development strategy are to reduce poverty and \ndevelop the country\u2019s human resource base. The strategy emphasizes a balanced approach to \nrural development, assistance to the urban poor, and development of major urban growth poles. \nThe SEDP accords high development priority to water supply and sanitation in urban centers. \nThe Government\u2019s long-term development objectives in the provincial towns are to supply \naffordable water that meets the drinking water quality standards,3 with adequate supply to at \nleast 70% of the provincial urban population. The long-term objectives for sanitation are to \nenable the population as a whole to have access to environmental sanitation facilities, and \nestablish treatment for wastewater in all provincial towns.  \n \n                                                 \n3  The World Health Organization\u2019s standards are currently used until the national standards are approved. ", "3 \n9.  Improving access of the poor to water supply and sanitation, and promoting sustainable \nmanagement of the environment continue to be key development strategies of SEDP II, 2001\u2013\n2005. The Government will promote wider provision of affordable potable water supply and \nsanitation, as it contributes broadly to tackling the causes of poverty and improving public \nhealth. SEDP II also recognizes that untreated wastewater is a significant problem leading to \nthe pollution of rivers.  \n \n10.  Since 1999, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) has been working on an \nurban water supply policy. The policy calls for (i) a demand\u2013responsive approach in developing \nnew water supply systems in the urban centers, (ii) a wide range of private sector participation \nin providing the services, (iii) full cost recovery and improvement in tariff collection efficiency, \n(iv) access of the poor to improved water supply systems, (v) financial autonomy of public \nutilities, and (vi) establishment of an independent regulator for the water supply sector. This \npolicy was later combined with the rural water supply and sanitation policy and became the \nNational  Policy  on  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation,  which  was  approved  by  the  Council  of \nMinisters in February 2003. MIME has been working with ADB, World Bank, World Health \nOrganization (WHO), and other development agencies in establishing national drinking water \nquality standards; MIME has also been working, with assistance from the World Bank, on \nsetting up the standards for designing and constructing piped water supply systems in both \nurban and rural areas, and on establishing a regulatory framework for the water supply sector. \n \nD.  External Assistance \n11.  ADB\u2019s assistance to the urban sector in Cambodia started in 1993 when ADB approved \na small-scale TA to assess the needs of the water supply and sanitation sectors.4 The TA \nrecommendations led to assistance for an  urban water supply and sanitation project,5 and, \nsubsequently, the preparation of the Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project.6 To \nimprove the institutional capacity of the Department of Potable Water Supply7 under MIME, ADB \napproved TA8 to provide essential training on technical, financial, and management skills and \ndevelop a database on provincial waterworks covering physical and financial assets as well as \nhuman resources. In 1996, ADB approved TA for preparing an integrated urban development \nproject that eventually led to Loan 1725-CAM(SF): Provincial Towns Improvement Project.  \n \n12.  Other  key  development  agencies  in  the  sector  include  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernments of France and Japan. The World Bank approved an urban water supply project in \nFebruary 1998 to augment water production capacity in Phnom Penh, improve water supply and \nmanagement in Sihanoukville, and upgrade the accounting systems of water supply authorities \nin  both  Phnom  Penh  and  Sihanoukville.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  working  with  the \nGovernment on a water supply and sanitation program covering about 140 semiurban centers \nover  the  next  15  years.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  been  helping  the  Government \nrehabilitate the Phum Prek water treatment plant and a part of the distribution networks in \nPhnom Penh, and prepare a drainage and flood control master plan for Phnom Penh. The \nGovernment of France has provided significant assistance for water supply, drainage, and \nenvironmental protection. It has supported the improvement of the billing system in the Phnom \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

Under  the  ADB-financed Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage \nProject,  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD)  cofinanced  a \nneighborhood improvement program, under which a nongovernment organization (NGO) is \nemployed to conduct a community awareness and education program aimed at improving \nsanitation conditions in low-income communities.  \n \n13.  Over the years, ADB has been coordinating well with other development agencies in \nboth physical investments and a wide range of policy and project-related issues, including \nautonomy of water utilities, private sector participation, water tariffs, national water supply and \nsanitation policies, and drinking water quality standards. An updated list of external assistance \nto the sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nE.  Lessons Learned \n14.  Major lessons learned with regard to sustainable sector development and timely project \nimplementation  include  the  need  for  cost  recovery,  adequate  funding  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M), community participation and education, and institutional capacity building. \nA major cause of unsustainable projects in the sector, mostly assisted by external agencies, is \nlack  of  O&M  funds.  Actions  to  generate  adequate  financial  resources  for  project  O&M, \nespecially for those components where a direct user charge is difficult to apply, should be \nidentified and discussed with concerned Government agencies during policy dialogue. Great \nefforts have to be made to develop a feasible cost recovery mechanism. If cost recovery is \nthrough indirect means such as development charges or local fees, management and auditing \nof the additional revenues and expenditure should be considered in the project design.  \n \n15.  The  ADB-financed  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Project  included  a \ncommunity awareness and education program cofinanced by NORAD to encourage community \nparticipation in project planning and implementation, and to educate the urban residents on \nenvironmental sanitation matters. Initial success has led the Government and NORAD to agree \nto expand the program's coverage and extend its duration. The findings of the program are \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  other  developing  member  countries,  that  community \ninvolvement in planning and implementing projects leads to a greater sense of ownership and \nenhanced sustainability of the services.  \n \n16.  Institutional strengthening and capacity building are essential for project implementation \nand long-term sustainability. Severe shortage of skilled personnel, a legacy of recent eventful \nhistory, is a major constraining factor in project design. Consulting services under the Project \nwill provide necessary technical support for project management. The Project will also provide \non-the-job  training  to  the  officials  involved  in  project  implementation.  It  is  expected  that \ncapacities  of  the  institutions  involved  in  the  Project  will  be  further  strengthened  during \nimplementation. A major lesson learned from the ADB financed projects in the sector is that \nminimizing the number of procurement contracts will substantially simplify implementation. This \nis  especially  relevant  for  executing  agencies  (EAs)  with  limited  experience  in  managing \nexternally funded projects.  \n \nF.  ADB's Sector Strategy \n17.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the water supply and sanitation sectors in the country supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development objective of reducing poverty and developing the country\u2019s human \nresource base. It recognizes that scarce financial and human resources and weak institutional ", "5 \ncapacities are the key constraints to the sector's development. The thrusts of the strategy are to \n(i)  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  initiatives  to  create  a  conducive  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional framework for sustainable sectoral development; (ii) emphasize institutional capacity \nbuilding;  and  (iii)  link  assistance  with  cost  recovery  potential  and  institutional  capacities. \nOperationally, the strategy requires (i) participation of beneficiaries, particularly women and \nlocal communities, in project planning, design, implementation, and O&M; (ii) the development \nand  utilization  of  affordable  and  appropriate  technologies;  (iii)  clearly  defined  O&M \nresponsibilities and financing sources; and (iv) well-defined cost recovery mechanisms that are \naffordable, equitable, and manageable. Crosscutting issues such as poverty reduction, women \nin development, and environmental protection remain the central concerns of the strategy.   \n \nIV.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n18.  It has been recognized that substantial improvement of the living standards of the rural \npoor, who account for 84% of the total population, is closely linked with economic development \nin urban centers. The expected benefits of rural development can be realized only if farmers are \nable to sell their increased agricultural produce to the urban economy in exchange for new \nfarming  equipment,  fertilizer,  seeds,  technology,  and  better  consumption  goods.  Rural \ndevelopment, therefore, is correlated to the absorptive capacity of the urban economy for \nincreased rural produce. The provincial towns serve as the economic centers for the rural \nhinterland in the provinces, and the links between the rural and urban economies in the country. \nThese  towns  are  the  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and  processing  centers  for \nagricultural produce from the provinces. They also provide part\u2013time employment opportunities, \nand hence additional income, for poor farmers during the slack seasons. Improving urban \nservices, including water supply and sanitation, in the provincial towns will therefore contribute \nto poverty reduction in both rural and urban areas. \n \n19.  The selection of the project towns took into consideration the geographic concentration \nof ADB\u2019s previous assistance and the economic growth potential, the status of cost recovery, \nand  institutional  capabilities  of  the  provincial  towns.  Four  selected  towns?Svay  Rieng, \nKompong Cham, Kampot, and Sihanoukville?are in areas under ADB\u2019s first Rural Infrastructure \nImprovement Project.9 The three other towns?Battambang, Kompong Thom, and Pursat?are \nalong the major national highways where ADB is the major multilateral development institution \nproviding financial assistance.10 Battambang, located near the Cambodian-Thai border and \nalong national highway No. 5, is the largest provincial town and has the potential to become the \nmajor trade center in the northern part of Cambodia. The seaport and tourist resources in \nSihanoukville make it the fastest growing town in the country. Transport services and tourism \nwill continue contribute significantly to its economic growth. Kompong Cham is the capital town \nof traditionally the richest province of the country and has the potential to become the major \ncenter  of  agro-industries.  With  the  improvement  of  the  highways  along  the  transportation \ncorridor connecting Viet Nam and Thailand, economic development in these and other project \ntowns is expected to take off rapidly. \n \n20.  The current urban and environmental conditions in the provincial towns have an adverse \nimpact on people's health and life quality, and are constraining the economic growth potential of \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1995.

Improving urban services, including water supply and sanitation, in the provincial \ntowns is also closely linked to the objectives of other social development programs in the urban \ncenters, such as primary health care. In addition, the development of provincial towns will help \nabsorb the rural migrants and reduce pressures on the urban environment, infrastructure, and \nemployment in the capital city of Phnom Penh. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n21.  The Project aims to improve the urban environment, public health, and basic urban \nservices in seven towns to support the Government\u2019s development objective of reducing urban \npoverty through sustained economic growth. The major project components are as follows.  \n \n1.  Part A. Community Sanitation and Health Awareness Program \n22.  Sanitation conditions in the poor communities of the project towns will be improved \nthrough  community  participation  in  subproject  design  and  cost  sharing.  The  communities \nselected will contribute in kind to the capital cost for house connections or on-site sanitation \nfacilities. The component will cover the cost of underground structure for on-site sanitation \nfacilities, and cleaning and repairing community drains. About 3,500 poor households in the \nproject towns are expected to benefit from the program. A community sanitation committee will \nbe set up in each of the selected poor communities to coordinate activities related to the project \ndesign and in-kind contribution arrangements. The project management unit (PMU) will provide \ntechnical support to the community sanitation committees. This component will also provide \nfunds to prepare a program on cost recovery, sanitation, and health awareness to be broadcast \nby Government television and radio stations. \n \n2.  Part B. Water Supply \n23.  This component will improve water supply conditions in Battambang, Kampot, Kompong \nCham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay Rieng. The subprojects will construct, upgrade, or \nrehabilitate the water production facilities (river intakes, deep wells, and treatment plants), and \nupgrade  or  extend  the  reticulation  networks.  The  reticulation  extension  will  include  direct \nconnections to individual consumers, as well as community water supply points for low-income \nhouseholds.  The  Project  will  provide  training  in  leakage  detection,  O&M,  and  preventive \nmaintenance. Provincial waterworks will acquire laboratory equipment and materials for water \nquality monitoring.  \n \n3.  Part C. Wastewater Management \n24.  A sewage collection and transmission network, and a treatment plant in Sihanoukville \nwith a capacity of 5,700 cubic meters per day will be designed and built. The works include (i) \ninstalling about 13 kilometers (km) of interceptor and trunk mains, 44 km of reticulation pipes, \nand  3,300  property  connections;  and  (ii)  constructing  anaerobic  ponds,  facultative  ponds, \nmaturation ponds, and inlet and outlet sparges and outlet weirs.  \n \n4.  Part D. Local Governance and Resource Mobilization \n25.  The component reviews the current legal and administrative structure of the provincial/ \nmunicipal governments of Battambang, Kompong Cham, and Sihanoukville, and recommends a \ncomprehensive legal and institutional reform action plan to improve local government financial \npositions and fully decentralize the authority for urban development and management. It also ", "7 \nreviews  the  current  and  potential  revenue  base  of  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville,  and \nrecommends an immediate action plan for the municipality of Sihanoukville to expand its \nrevenues within the existing legal and institutional framework to cover the anticipated O&M cost \nof the wastewater management system to be constructed under the Project. The revenues \ncollected under the immediate action plan will be put in an earmarked account and will be used \nfor  the  wastewater  management  system  in  Sihanoukville.  The  earmarked  account  will  be \nsubject to auditing under the Project.  \n \n5.  Part E. Implementation Assistance \n26.  This component covers (i) consulting services for community development, engineering \ndesign, construction supervision, and project management support; (ii) project administration \nequipment and facilities; and (iii) training.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n27.  The cost of the approved Project, including physical and price contingencies and interest \nduring construction, was estimated at $26.3 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost was \n$18.3 million, 70% of the total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, was $8.0 \nmillion equivalent, 30% of the total. \n \n28.  ADB provided a loan of $20.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources with a \nterm of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan covers 76% of the total project \ncost including $18.2 million foreign exchange cost and $1.8 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  New  Zealand  Government,  through  its  Asia  Development  Assistance \nFacility, cofinanced, on a parallel basis, a part of the consulting services (project management \nsupport) for about $0.2 million. The balance of $6.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost \nis  financed  by  the  Government  and  local  communities.  The  Borrower  is  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia. The Government transfers the project funds to MIME and Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT) through budgetary allocation. The financing plan of the approved Project \nis shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Costs \n         \nADB  18.17  1.83  20.00  76.00 \nADAF  0.13  0.10  0.23  0.90 \nGovernment  0.00  5.87  5.87  22.30 \nLocal Communities  0.00  0.20  0.20  0.80 \nTotal  18.30  8.00  26.30  100.00 \nADAF = Asia Development Assistance Facility, ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  MIME is the EA for parts A and B, MPWT for parts C and D. MIME and MPWT have set \nup, respectively, a PMU at the central level, and the provincial/municipal governments in the \nproject towns have set up their respective project implementation units (PIUs). The Project was \nexpected to be implemented over 5.5 years and be completed by mid\u20132005. The approved ", "8 \nProject has been progressing well. All civil works financed under the original loan will be \ncompleted before the original Project completion date. Major civil works for the water supply \ncomponent in six towns were combined into two contracts, and one (four towns) has been \nawarded following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The civil works for the \nSihanoukville wastewater management system were divided into two ICB contracts, and one \n(Alternate 2 partial works) has been awarded. A contract for community sanitation and health \nawareness program has been awarded following local competitive bidding procedures.  \n \n30.  The municipality of Sihanoukville had acquired the land for the wastewater treatment \nplant prior to the start of the Project. Detailed design revealed that, while no resettlement would \nbe incurred, additional rights-of-way would have to be acquired and some structures dismantled \nfor laying the trunk sewers. Short resettlement plans,11 following ADB guidelines, have been \nprepared by MPWT and reviewed by ADB. Comments from ADB have been incorporated in the \nrevised plans and the final short resettlement plans were submitted to ADB on 6 July 2003. The \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has confirmed availability of a budget for implementing \nthe short resettlement plans. The water supply component needs two pieces of land, one in \nPursat (10,707 m2, three owners), and one in Kompong Thom (735 m2, one owner). MIME has \nprepared a short resettlement plan, which had been reviewed and approved by ADB, and \ncompleted  land  acquisition.  The  Project-affected  persons  and  MIME  have  negotiated  and \nagreed on the compensation based on market values. The short resettlement plan prepared by \nMIME  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A,  and  those  prepared  by  MPWT  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nE.  Environment and Social Measures \n31.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  and  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were conducted during the feasibility study of the approved Project. The \nIEEs concluded that environmental impacts during Project construction and operation would be \nminor,  and  no  environmental  impact  assessment  would  be  needed.  Minimization  of \nenvironmental disturbances such as noise and dust during construction has been considered in \nthe  detailed  design,  and  appropriate  environmental  management  requirements  have  been \nincluded in the environmental management plans (EMPs). All contractors will be required to \nreinstate affected areas to their original, or a better, condition. Adequately planned preventive \nmaintenance programs will be developed for all facilities constructed under the Project, and safe \nworking  practices  at  international  standards  will  be  adopted  in  both  the  construction  and \noperational phases. To ensure that water to be supplied under the Project meets the national \ndrinking water quality standards in the six project towns, and the discharges at the Sihanoukville \nwastewater treatment plant satisfies the Government's environmental requirements, the Project \nprovides a budget for laboratory equipment for all the Project towns.  \n \n32.  Community  and  beneficiary  participation  has  been  encouraged  throughout  project \npreparation. Extensive discussions have been held with key stakeholders including central \nGovernment departments, provincial and municipal governments, NGOs, and communities. \nSocioeconomic and technical surveys, key informant interviews, and  public meetings were \ncarried out during the feasibility study and detailed design. The Project is designed in response \nto the communities\u2019 needs and willingness to pay. It incorporates social measures, such as \nproviding community water selling points, to ensure that the needs of the disadvantaged social \ngroups for basic urban services will be taken care of, and that there will be equitable access to \n                                                 \n11  One for Alternate 2 partial works covering the eastern part of the town, and one for Alternate 3 balance of works, \ncovering the southern part of the town. ", "9 \nwater supply and sanitation. The Project will expand piped water supply systems into currently \nunserved areas where the low income groups live, and provide reliable water supply at a price \n2\u20133 times lower than that from water vendors. The community sanitation and health awareness \nprogram  is  intended  to  disseminate  knowledge  and  provide  financial  assistance  to  the \ncommunities for improving hygiene practice and sanitation conditions.  \n \nF.  Benefits \n33.  The Project will benefit about 350,000 people, about 30% of whom live below the official \npoverty line. Corresponding economic benefits include the time and cost savings from buying, \nfetching, treating, and storing water; improved public and family hygiene and health; reduced \nmedical outlays; increased productive days for adults and school attendance for children; and \nmore employment opportunities.  The project feasibility study carried out social  and gender \nimpact analyses, including impacts of the Project on vulnerable groups such as the urban poor, \nwomen, and children. The analyses concluded that there were overall positive social impacts, \nthe impacts were not gender biased, and all urban residents in the project areas would benefit \nfrom the improved urban environment and services. The positive impacts of the improved urban \nenvironment are more evident for women, children, and the urban poor. Statistics show that at \nleast 75% of women living in provincial towns are either self-employed or unpaid family workers. \nSafe and convenient water supply will significantly increase their productive time and reduce the \nburden of fetching water. Improved water supply will also benefit children. Apart from the fact \nthat children are most susceptible to waterborne diseases, Government surveys show that 52% \nof male students and 37% of female students drop out of school because of the need to help \nwith household chores, of which fetching water is a major one. The poor have fewer choices of \nlocations, and therefore are prone to environmental hazards such as unsafe water supply, \nunsanitary sewage discharge, and solid waste accumulation.  \n \n34.  Sihanoukville has become a major destination for both domestic and foreign tourists. \nThe sewage collection and treatment system in Sihanoukville will significantly reduce pollution in \nbeaches,  thus  protecting  the  coastal  environment,  and  promote  tourism  and  the  service \nindustry, hence the employment opportunities, in the city.    \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n35.  Compared with the bidding results, the cost for Part B (the six-town water supply \nsystems) and part C (wastewater management system in Sihanoukville) was substantially \nunderestimated for the approved Project at appraisal, with the base cost for part B estimated at \n$10.8 million, and that for part C at $5.6 million. The bidding results for the two components \nshowed the lowest bid price, net of contingencies, of $14.4 million for part B and $9.5 million for \npart C. The key factors contributing to the increase in cost are discussed in paras. 36-40.  \n \n1.  Provincial Towns Water Supply Systems \n36.  A comparison of the winning bid and the cost estimates at appraisal shows a significant \ncost increase in the water intake and treatment facilities in Battambang, Kampot, Kompong \nThom, and Pursat. While the feasibility study and appraisal assumed that the existing facilities \ncould be rehabilitated at lower cost, the design consultants recommended reconstruction of \nthese facilities instead. Apart from technical considerations, such as water source quality and \nsystem compatibility, the reconstructed facilities would have a longer useful life (50 years if ", "10 \nreconstructed  compared  with  15  years  if  rehabilitated),  and  higher  service  level  (100% \ncompared with 60%). Therefore, the high capital cost for reconstruction would be a lower-cost \nsolution in the long run. Rehabilitation at low capital cost was preferred during the feasibility \nstudy and appraisal because of other considerations: political instability in the Government, \neconomic inactivity in the provinces, and poor institutional and financial capabilities at the \nprovincial waterworks. However, all these aspects have changed significantly since appraisal.  \n \n37.  Another major cause of the cost increase is the construction of generator and laboratory \nbuildings and the provision of generators and laboratory equipment and chemicals in the project \ntowns. The feasibility study anticipated that the provincial/municipal electrical supplies would be \nsignificantly improved to provide reliable electrical supplies when the Project is completed. \nHowever, the electrical supplies are still unreliable in the project towns at the design stage, and \nthe waterworks would need to install their own generators to ensure smooth operations of their \nwater supply systems. The laboratory facilities were considered necessary at the design stage \nto meet the increasing demand of stakeholders for better water quality monitoring all over the \ncountry. The laboratories would also be useful for the local authorities to regulate local small \nand medium-sized food processing enterprises.  \n \n38.  A change in the chlorination systems also contributes to the cost increase. Presently, \nnone of the project towns chlorinates its water supply, either because there is no chorine dosing \nsystem in place, or because of the high cost of chemicals for the simple calcium hypochlorite \ndosing systems present in some project towns. The feasibility study recommended the provision \nor  repair  of  calcium  hypochlorite  dosing  systems.  However,  the  design  consultants \nrecommended  gas  chlorination  systems  instead,  which  are  more  expensive  in  capital \ninvestment, but have a much lower O&M cost and will be less expensive and more effective for \nthe towns in the long run. \n \n39.  Unit costs for pipeline construction appear to have risen significantly since appraisal. \nInstallation  of  pipes  in  the  size  range  most  frequently  employed  in  the  project  (100-200 \nmillimeter in diameter), the unit cost has risen by over 50%. Since the transmission and \ndistribution pipes typically represent a substantial percentage of the total value of a water supply \nsystem, such cost increases adversely affected the capital cost of the Project. Besides, the unit \nprices used at appraisal did not include separate categories for general items to be furnished by \nthe contractor, such as securities, insurance, office facilities, etc. Such costs, when considered \ncumulatively, substantially increased the value of the contract. \n \n2.  Sihanoukville Wastewater Management System \n40.  A major cause of the cost overrun for the Sihanoukville wastewater management system \nis the change in the diameters of trunk sewers. The topographic survey conducted during \ndetailed design revealed that, to keep the effluent outlet at the treatment plant at a level high \nenough to accommodate tidal changes and flooding levels, the slope of the trunk sewer lines \nwould be relatively flat (0.6 meter per 1,000 meter), which in turn requires pipelines with a much \nlarger  diameter  (900  millimeter  vs  450  millimeter,  for  instance),  to  maintain  the  designed \nsewage flows. Along with the change in the size of the trunk sewers, the size of connector \nsewers was also adjusted to minimize the long-term investment cost. In addition, to maintain the \nflow of sewage by gravity without pumping in the system, embankment is needed for many \nportions of the pipelines.  \n \n41.  Another major cause of the cost overrun is replacement of the polyethylene lining of the \nanaerobic ponds with concrete lining, and the need to dig dewater trenches at the work site and ", "11 \nprovide grouted stone and clay lining for the facultative and maturation ponds. This change is \nnecessary because the geotechnical investigation carried out during detailed design revealed a \nvery high groundwater table throughout the project area, especially at the treatment plant site \n(at 0.4-0.8 meter in depth), and aside from unconsolidated sandy soils at the surface layer \n(down to 1 meter in depth), there are loose silty sands at the treatment plant site. Other factors \ncontributing to the cost overrun include: (i) the unit cost of the comparable pipes had increased \nby more than 50%, (ii) the domestic preference had resulted in higher cost, and (iii) the winning \nbid has an unexpected high price for general items. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n42.  The economic, financial, environmental, social, and institutional impacts of the cost \noverrun  have  been  reappraised.  The  objectives,  structure,  and  overall  implementation \narrangements of the approved Project remain unchanged, despite the cost overrun; however, \nwithout additional financing, the geographic coverage, hence the number of beneficiaries of the \nProject, will be affected. Without supplementary financing, the approved project will be able to \ncover water supply for only four provincial towns12 instead of six, and only half of the sewage \ncollection and treatment system in Sihanoukville will be constructed and operated.  \n \n43.  The economic viability of each of the subprojects was reevaluated based on updated \ninformation on benefits and construction costs. The reevaluation indicates that despite the \nincreases in cost, all subprojects remain economically viable. For water supply subprojects, the \ncost increase has been largely offset by the higher value of nonincremental water consumption, \nwhich was significantly undervalued at appraisal. For the wastewater management subproject in \nSihanoukville, higher than expected tourist arrivals in the last few years and recent economic \ndevelopment in the town have significantly raised the economic benefits of the subproject. \nDetails of the economic analysis are in Appendix 3. \n \n44.  The impact of the cost overrun on the financial viability of the Project and the financial \nsustainability of the provincial waterworks depends critically on the ability of the waterworks to \ncollect adequate water tariffs to recover the increased cost. While water tariffs have to be \nincreased in all the project towns except Battambang, the proposed water tariffs are affordable \nto the targeted beneficiaries including the low-income groups. The tariffs are also significantly \nlower than those projected for 2004 at appraisal. This is mainly because of lower-than-expected \ndepreciation of the domestic currency (the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-\u00e0-vis the \ndollar remains unchanged since appraisal). Moreover, for those people who are unconnected to \nthe piped system, the proposed tariffs are much lower than those for alternative sources, such \nas water vendors. In developing the wastewater tariffs for Sihanoukville, the design consultants \nhad extensive consultations with municipal and district governments, local businessmen, and \nthe general public, and found that while additional investment cost would result in higher tariffs, \nthese were still generally affordable to the local enterprises and residents, mainly due to the \neconomic growth led by tourism in the city. The analysis of the affordability of the water and \nwastewater tariffs to the communities, including low-income groups, in the project towns is \nincluded in the financial analysis in Appendix 4. Financial projections for the six provincial \nwaterworks are presented in Supplementary Appendix  C, and financial projections for the \nSihanoukville wastewater management system are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n                                                 \n12  Battambang, Pursat, Kompong Thom, and Kompong Cham for a total contract amount of $10,581,721.35. \n ", "12 \n45.  As  the  reappraised  Project  will  retain  the  coverage  and  beneficiary  targets  of  the \napproved Project, the social impact of the proposed supplementary loan will be limited to the \naffordability and willingness to pay of the targeted groups. To mitigate the impact, MIME has \nagreed to introduce a credit policy in the project towns to allow the low-income groups in the \nprovincial towns to pay the connection charge by installment. MPWT has also developed a tariff \nand connection charge scheme that will provide cross-subsidies from industrial and commercial \nusers to the poor. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy, prepared on the basis of \nthe social analysis carried out in the feasibility study of the approved Project and findings of the \nreappraisal missions, is attached as Appendix 5. \n \n46.  IEEs prepared for parts A, B, and C under the approved Project were reviewed and \nupdated during reappraisal, based on findings of the engineering design. The updated IEEs \nreconfirmed that the Project would have an overall positive environmental impact, that minor \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  could  be  mitigated  or \neliminated  by  following  international  best  practices,  and  that  no  environmental  impact \nassessment was needed. To ensure that adverse environmental impacts are mitigated and \nenvisaged environmental benefits are properly monitored, an environmental management plan \n(EMP) was prepared separately by MIME and MPWT. The EMPs addressed the following \nenvironmental issues: (i) siting of subproject components and good construction practices to \nminimize dust, noise, or silt runoff from constructions, and disruption of vehicular and pedestrian \ntraffic;  (ii)  worker  and  local  resident  safety,  and  adequate  construction  monitoring; \n(iii) health/safety  hazards  in  treatment  plant  operations  and  pipeline  maintenance;  and \n(iv) adequate operation stage monitoring. The Project provides funds for laboratory equipment \nand  training  of  operational  staff  on  environmental  monitoring.  The  project \nexecuting/implementing  agencies  have  appointed  an  officer  responsible  for  environmental \nmonitoring in each project town. The summary IEE (SIEE), prepared under the approved project \nand updated on the basis of the revised IEEs, is presented in Appendix 6. The revised IEEs are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix E, and EMPs in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nC.  Remedial Steps \n47.  Before reappraising the proposed supplementary loan, alternative remedial measures \nwere explored. Financing from other bilateral and multilateral funding sources were sought, but \nit was found that few agencies would be able to provide additional funding within the time frame \nbecause of full commitment in their existing assistance programs. Scaling down the scope of \nwork for the components that experienced cost overruns to maintain the cost within the budget \nwas also examined. Analyses showed, however, that while this was technically feasible, it would \nresult in a project with a substantially reduced capacity to meet the demand of the communities, \nsustain economic growth in the urban centers, and protect the urban environment. A significant \nproportion of the expected socioeconomic and environmental benefits of the approved Project \nwould be lost.  \n \n48.  For the water supply component, reducing the number of towns was considered an \nalternative. However, since the beginning of the feasibility study, numerous socioeconomic \nsurveys, technical survey, public awareness campaigns, and health and sanitation education \nprograms have been carried out in the communities and have been fully supported by the \ncommunities and local governments alike. There is high expectation from all the project towns. It \nwould be difficult to delete any town from the project. On the other hand, scaling down the \nscope of works in each town would substantially affect the project's socioeconomic objectives, \nincrease the unit cost of water supply, and impact negatively the financial sustainability of the \nprovincial waterworks.  ", "13 \n \n49.  For the Sihanoukville wastewater management system, it is technically possible to divide \nthe sewerage collection areas as well as the treatment plant into two half systems, with the \nProject financing the cost of one part of the divided system. However, the scaling down would \nsignificantly reduce the financial, economic, and environmental benefits. The reduced number of \nconnections would result in higher capital and O&M cost per cubic meter of wastewater treated \nand would lead to tariffs significantly beyond the willingness to pay of the residents and \ncommercial and industrial establishments in the project areas. This would lead, in turn, to \nincreased risks of revenue collections and affect the financial sustainability of the proposed \nSihanoukville wastewater management unit. The financial analysis shows that, if only half of the \nsystem will be constructed and operated, the average incremental financial cost of a cubic \nmeter of wastewater treated will be 26% higher than if the complete system is constructed and \noperated. It also shows the full cost recovery will be achieved only by year 2015 instead of \n2009, and with much lower internal cash generation capacity. Apart from the financial costs, the \nintended environmental benefits would also be seriously eroded.  \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n50.  The revised cost of the Project is estimated at $34.56 million equivalent, comprising \n$23.56 million in foreign exchange, and $11.00 million equivalent in local currency. The total \nincrease  is  $8.24  million  equivalent,  comprising  $5.22  million  in  foreign  exchange  and \n$3.02 million equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB provide a supplementary loan \nof  SDR4,546,000  ($6.26  million)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  the  entire \nadditional foreign exchange cost and $1.04 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of $1.98 million. The ADB loan will carry a term of 32 years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. Details \nof the original and  revised cost estimates for the  Project are presented in Appendix 7. The \nfinancing plan for the cost overrun is shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Costs \n         \nAsian Development Bank  5.22  1.04  6.26  76.00 \nGovernment  0.00  1.98  1.98  24.00 \nTotal  5.22  3.02  8.24  100.00 \n%  63.40  36.60  100.00   \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n51.  The implementation arrangements for the supplementary loan will be unchanged from \nthe approved Project. MIME will be the EA for provincial towns water supply systems and \nMPWT will be the EA for the Sihanoukville wastewater management system. The respective \nPMU and PIU in each EA will be responsible for day-to-day project management.  \n \n52.  The reappraised project implementation is expected to experience some delays because \nof the time lag between the original and the supplementary loan. The completion date of the \nwater supply component will be extended from March 2004 to June 2005, and that of the \nwastewater  management  system,  from  June  2005  to  December  2005.  Overall  project \nimplementation is expected to experience about 6 months delay. Consequently, the utilization ", "14 \nperiod of the original loan, and hence that of the proposed supplementary loan, will be extended \nfrom 31 December 2005 to 30 June 2006. The revised project implementation schedule is \npresented in Appendix 8. \n \n53.  Two major civil works contracts will be financed under the proposed supplementary loan, \none for water supply in the remaining two towns, and one for the second half of the wastewater \nmanagement system in Sihanoukville. Civil works for the water supply systems in the six \nprovincial towns and Sihanoukville wastewater management system have been tendered under \nthe  original  loan  following  ICB  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. However, the winning bidders were awarded civil works contracts for only four \ntowns for water supply and half of the wastewater management system in Sihanoukville due to \nfunding  constraints.  As  bidders  for  both  components  have  included  bids  for  the  complete \nsystems, the remaining two civil works contacts will be awarded directly to the respective \nwinning bidder based on original bids through negotiations, to save time and reduce cost. ICB \nprocedures will be followed in case such negotiations fail to reach an agreement within 90 days \nfrom the effective date of the Supplementary Loan Agreement. About 33 (13 international and \n20 domestic) person-months of consulting services will be required to supervise the extended \nperiod of construction. The services will be financed under the original loan through a contract \nvariation.  \n \nF.  Supplementary Loan Policy Requirements \n54.  Since the 1991 Peace Accord, the Cambodian economy has been rebuilt from the ruins \nof two decades of regional and domestic conflicts. While remarkable progress has been made in \nthe past decade, its weak and underdeveloped economic base still cannot provide adequate \nforeign exchange to meet the demand for consumption and investment. Nor can it generate \nsufficient revenues for the Government to rebuild the essential economic infrastructure in the \ncountry. Consequently, the country has been experiencing continued deficit in both external and \nfiscal accounts. Its development programs are largely financed by external funding agencies.  \n \n55.  The Government has accorded water supply, sanitation, and environmental protection \nhigh development priority, as reflected in SEDP, 1996-2000, and SEDP II, 2001-2005. The \nplans recognize that developing water supply and sanitation contributes positively to poverty \nreduction, and that environmental protection is essential for long-term sustainable development. \nFor  these  reasons,  the  Government  has  reconfirmed  the  priority  of  the  Project  in  its \ndevelopment programs.  \n \n56.  Given its limited domestic resources, the Government has sought additional funding \nfrom a number of external sources to finance the cost overrun. Due to the urgency of the \nfinancing requirement, it has been difficult for the Government to receive the funding in the time \nframe required for the Project. Although the Government has difficulty in providing funding for \nthe cost overrun up-front, the Government and the EAs have committed to implement full cost \nrecovery for the investment. MIME has agreed with ADB to gradually introduce the required \ntariff increase in the six provincial towns to reach full cost recovery by the end of 2006. Similarly, \nMPWT and the municipality of Sihanoukville have agreed with ADB to introduce wastewater \ntariffs in the city to reach full cost recovery by the end of 2009. \n \nVI.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION \nA.  General \n57.  The Project will bring about positive socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the \neconomy as well as to 350,000 urban residents in the provincial towns. Improved urban services ", "15 \nwill enable the provincial towns to attract investments, sustain economic growth, better serve \nthe surrounding rural economy, and contribute to the reduction of rural poverty. Improved water \nsupply and sanitation will benefit the residents directly due to time and cost savings from buying, \nfetching, treating, and storing water; improved public and family hygiene and health; reduced \nmedical outlays; and increased productive days. The  benefit to women and children will be \nsignificant because a safe and convenient water supply and better sanitation will free them from \none of the heavy house chores, and allow women to engage in income-generating activities and \nchildren to attend schools. The clean environment in Sihanoukville will sustain the tourist boom \nin the city, and create revenues and employment opportunities for the residents of the city.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n58.  The Project remains economically and financially viable despite the cost overrun. The \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the water supply subprojects range from 14.8% to \n34.6%, higher than the assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Sensitivity tests assessed \nthe magnitude of the impact of adverse changes in the key parameters underlying the EIRRs. \nThe results indicate that the EIRRs are robust and are able to withstand adverse changes in the \nparameters. The analysis indicates that the EIRRs of the subprojects are most sensitive to \ndelays in project implementation (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Results of Economic Analysis \n \n    Sensitivity Tests \n  Cost +  Benefit  Implementation \nAppraisal (%)  Reappraisal (%)  10%  \u201310%  Delayed by  \nTown \n(%)  (%)  1 Year \n(%) \nBattambang  EIRR (%)  15.6  17.1  14.8  14.5  13.7 \nSI  4.2  5.2 \nSV (%)  23.7  19.2 \nKampot  EIRR (%)  25.0  23.9  21.2  21.0  18.9 \nSI  1.8  2.8 \nSV (%)  56.1  35.9 \nKompong Cham  EIRR (%)  34.6  22.7  20.0  19.8  18.0 \nSI   2.0  3.0 \nSV (%)  50.8  33.7 \nKompong Thom  EIRR (%)  16.6  15.5  13.5  13.3  12.7 \nSI  5.4  6.3 \nSV (%)  18.5  15.8 \nPursat  EIRR (%)  20.2  15.4  13.5  13.3  12.7 \nSI  5.3  6.3 \nSV (%)  18.7  15.8 \nSvay Rieng  EIRR (%)  15.9  14.7  12.8  12.6  12.1 \nSI  6.7  7.7 \nSV (%)  14.9  12.9 \nSihanoukville  EIRR (%)  22.2  16.4  15.4  15.2  14.2 \nSI  2.0  3.0 \nSV (%)  49.7  33.2 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n59.  The financial analysis shows that the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for each \nwater  supply  subproject  ranges  from  3.3%  in  Kampot  to  8.6%  in  Battambang.  While  the \nconstruction is expected to be completed in 2005, a significant increase in the volume of water \nsold can be achieved starting from 2003 as a result of the leakage detection and monitoring \nprogram. Tariffs will be set at such a level that the average monthly expenditure on water of a \nhousehold with a private connection would be about 4% of the average monthly household ", "16 \nincome in all project towns. All households using a public selling point would spend less than \n3% of their average  monthly household income on water. With the implementation of the \nplanned financial measures, all towns will be in a position to sustain the subprojects. Projected \nfinancial statements for the waterworks indicate that all water supply subprojects will achieve full \ncost recovery and all water supply subprojects will generate positive cash flows from operations \nafter project completion. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n60.  The Government and the EAs have substantially complied with the covenants of the \napproved  Loan  1725-CAM(SF):  Provincial  Towns  Improvement  Project.  A  summary  of  the \nstatus of compliance with loan covenants is in Appendix 9. In addition, the Government and the \nEAs  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal \ndocuments: \n \n(i)  In accordance with the schedule agreed upon with ADB, MIME will annually \nincrease water tariffs in the six provincial towns during 2004-2006 to achieve full \ncost recovery of O&M plus depreciation not later than 31 December 2006. \n \n(ii)  MIME  will  introduce  payment  by  installment  for  connection  fees  in  the  six \nprovincial towns within 6 months of effectiveness of the Supplementary Loan \nAgreement. \n \n(iii)  The municipality of Sihanoukville, or its designee, will have the authority to \nadminister the Sihanoukville wastewater management system and collect fees \nfrom, among other sources, beneficiaries of the wastewater system. The fees \ncollected will be deposited into an earmarked bank account to be established by \nthe municipality of Sihanoukville, or its designee, and will be used solely for the \nSihanoukville wastewater system. Shortfalls, if any, between the fees collected \nand O&M expenses of the wastewater systems will be met from the budget of the \nmunicipality of Sihanoukville. MPWT and other Government agencies concerned \nwill review, after 2 years operation of the system, the feasibility of establishing a \nstate-owned autonomous enterprise to manage the wastewater management \nsystem. \n \n(iv)  MPWT and the municipality of Sihanoukville will approve the wastewater tariffs, \nas agreed upon with ADB, before 31 December 2004, and implemented the \ntariffs upon commissioning of the wastewater management system. The tariffs \nwill be increased over 2006-2009 to achieve recovery of O&M cost and capital \ndepreciation before 31 December 2009. \n \n(v)  MPWT and the municipality of Sihanoukville will implement a connection fee \nschedule to be agreed upon with ADB, which will provide cross-subsidies from \nindustrial and commercial beneficiaries to the low-income households. \n \n(vi)  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  MPWT  will  implement  the \nresettlement  plan  as  approved  by  ADB  and  ensure  that  all  Project-affected \npersons will be duly compensated in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. \n ", "17 \n(vii)  MIME and MPWT will ensure that the contractors will follow the respective \nenvironmental management plans as agreed upon with ADB.  \n \n(viii)  MPWT will ensure that an officer in the municipality of Sihanoukville, or its \ndesignee, will have an explicit responsibility for environmental monitoring and \nmanagement. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,546,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial \nTowns Improvement Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1% per annum  during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

General \n1.  The original economic analysis was undertaken in 1999 during the feasibility study. \nBecause of significant changes in the cost estimates between the feasibility study and detailed \nengineering  design  phases,  the  subprojects  were  reevaluated  using  detailed  design  cost \nestimates  and  updated  project  scope  and  benefits.  The  methodology  adopted  in  the \nreevaluation was essentially the same as that used at appraisal and has followed the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997)  and \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects  (1998). The  subprojects are \nevaluated over a period of 25 years with no salvage value assumed thereafter. \n \n2.  The capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of each \nsubproject were considered. Economic costs were derived from the financial project costs. All \ncosts are expressed in constant (2003) prices, and taxes and duties have been deducted from \nbase costs. Economic costs were valued using the domestic price numeraire, but expressed in \ndollars.  Tradable  components  have  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor (SERF)1 and nontradable components are valued at domestic market \nprices. A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) for unskilled labor was used to reflect opportunity \ncosts in the context of wide availability of unskilled labor in Cambodia.2 \nB.  Water Supply \n3.  The Project will directly benefit approximately 270,000 people in six provincial towns, \nnamely: Battambang, Kampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay Rieng. The \nappraisal report showed that all households including those with piped connections in the six \ntowns used a variety of sources of water throughout the year because of limited supply from the \nexisting systems. The construction of the Project will remove the water supply limitations and \nenable  more  households  to  be  connected  with  reliable  and  stable  piped  water  supply. \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  from  improved  water  supply  include  nonincremental  water \nconsumption, valued at the current average price of water supply from nonpiped sources \nranging  from  KR1,400  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  to  KR2,500  per  m3;  and  incremental  water \nconsumption, valued at the average demand price ranging from KR1,200 per m3 to KR1,850 per \nm3. The volume of nonincremental water consumption and incremental water consumption for \neach  subproject  was  estimated  based  on  household  surveys  and  the  population  that  the \nsubproject is going to serve.  \n \n4.  Resource cost savings are also expected from the Project. The socioeconomic survey \nshowed that all households in the six towns, including those with piped connections, were \nequipped with water storage facilities such as water tanks and jars to respond to the unstable \nand irregular water supply, and nearly a quarter of the households without piped connection had \nto spend 1\u20135 hours weekly to fetch water from sources other than a piped system. The reliable \nand stable water supply service provided by the Project will enable the households to get rid of \nthe water storage facility and stop spending time in fetching water. The cost savings on the \nwater storage facility and time savings, estimated from the household survey, range from \nKR1,100 to KR5,000  and from KR2,200 to KR5,500 per person per year, respectively.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The SERF is estimated at 1.11. \n2  The SWRF is estimated at 0.75. ", "22  Appendix 3 \n5.  The results of the economic analysis for water supply subprojects are summarized in \nTable A3.1. The reevaluated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range from 14.7% to \n23.9%. Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis and the \nconsequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% increase in the project cost, (ii) 10% \ndecrease in project benefits, and (iii) 1\u2013year delay of project benefits. The results show that the \nEIRRs are most sensitive to delays in project benefits. However, all EIRRs remain over 12% in \nthe worst possible scenario tested, indicating the economic viability of the subprojects. The \nswitching values range from 14.9% to 56.1% in the case of cost increase and 12.9% to 35.9% in \nthe case of benefit reduction.  \n \nTable A3.1: Economic Analysis of Water Supply Subprojects \n \n  Sensitivity Tests \nEIRR (%) \nCost +  Benefit  Implementation \nTown \n10%  \u201310%  Delayed by  \nAppraisal  Reappraisal  (%)  (%)  1 Year(%) \nBattambang  EIRR (%)  15.6  17.1  14.8  14.5  13.7 \nSI  4.2  5.2 \nSV (%)  23.7  19.2 \nKampot  EIRR (%)  25.0  23.9  21.2  21.0  18.9 \nSI  1.8  2.8 \nSV (%)  56.1  35.9 \nKompong Cham  EIRR (%)  34.6  22.7  20.0  19.8  18.0 \nSI   2.0  3.0 \nSV (%)  50.8  33.7 \nKompong Thom  EIRR (%)  16.6  15.5  13.5  13.3  12.7 \nSI  5.4  6.3 \nSV (%)  18.5  15.8 \nPursat  EIRR (%)  20.2  15.4  13.5  13.3  12.7 \nSI  5.3  6.3 \nSV (%)  18.7  15.8 \nSvay Rieng  EIRR (%)  15.9  14.7  12.8  12.6  12.1 \nSI  6.7  7.7 \nSV (%)  14.9  12.9 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \nC.  Sihanoukville Sewerage \n6.  Sihanoukville, located on the Gulf of Thailand, is a recognized tourism center with many \nnatural advantages, particularly four beautiful beaches and one attractive island. The coastal \ncity has been enjoying dramatic tourist growth in the past 5 years, with an average annual \ngrowth rate of more than 35% (70% for international tourists). With approximately 120,000 \ntourist arrivals in 2002, including 20,000 international tourist arrivals, and about 1,300 hotel \nrooms, Sihanoukville has become a leading coastal resort that attracts tourists traveling from \nViet  Nam,  Thailand,  and  Singapore.  While  the  booming  tourism  has  brought  growth  and \nemployment to the city, it has also produced an increasing amount of wastewater that has been \ndischarged into the open sea close to the beaches, polluting the very resources that have been \nthe tourist attractions of the city,  and posing health hazards to the recreational users of the \nbeaches. The problem will become more acute in the near future with increasing tourist arrivals \nand the completion of an urban water supply project in 2005.  \n \n7.  The Project will provide a reticulated sewerage system in the central area and major \ntourist destinations of Sihanoukville and a treatment plant that uses the stabilization ponds \nprocess. This treatment process was considered the least-cost solution, both at appraisal and \nreappraisal,  compared  with  other  wastewater  treatment  technologies.  It  is  suitable  for ", "  Appendix 3  23 \nSihanoukville where land cost is low and skilled technicians are rare. It has the advantage of low \ncapital and O&M cost, relatively high biological oxygen demand conversion, and minimum \noperational skills required. The treatment plant is located on vacant land far from the town \ncenter and residential areas; therefore, the environmental impact of bad odors from the ponds is \nnegligible.  Because  power  supply  is  expensive  and  unreliable  in  Cambodia,  the  sewage \ncollection, reticulation, and transmission will be gravity-fed with no pumping to minimize energy \nconsumption in operating the system. \n \n8.  The major economic benefits expected from the subproject are tourism benefits arising \nfrom (i) increased number of tourists visiting Sihanoukville, and (ii) increased daily spending by \ntourists. The analysis considers mainly the benefits from foreign tourists, as net spending by \nlocal tourists is marginal compared with that of foreign tourists.  \n \n9.  The tourism benefits attributable to the subproject are the increased net expenditure of \nforeign tourists and its multiplier effects on the country\u2019s economy, which are induced by the \nproject and retained by the country. The net expenditure of tourists, estimated at 30% of their \ngross expenditure, is the difference between the tourists\u2019 gross expenditure on tourism services \nand the costs of providing such services.  The analysis takes 50% of the project-induced \nincremental net expenditure of tourists as the benefits arising directly from the subproject and a \nfactor of 0.9 is used to adjust this net expenditure to the benefits of the country after considering \nthe leakage and multiplier effects of tourism benefits in the Mekong region.3 \n \n10.  The without-project scenario assumes wastewater will continue to flow untreated to the \nsea. The tourist\u2019s interest to visit Sihanoukville will be impaired by the increasing pollution of the \nbeaches which are the main tourist attractions. This scenario assumes tourist growth will \ngradually slow down from the current 35% to 8% in 2024, and the average tourist stay will be \nreduced by half a day. The with-project scenario assumes that tourist growth will slow down but \nat a more gradual rate, the average tourist stay will remain at 3.5 days, and tourist spending will \nincrease slightly by $1.5 per day to accommodate the wastewater treatment charges to hotels \nand restaurants which will be passed on to the tourists, who will be more willing to consume due \nto less health concerns.  These assumptions are considered conservative, as tourist arrivals \neven in  the with-project scenario equal only about 80% of the Government\u2019s projection  for \ntourist arrivals in Sihanoukville.4 The assumptions made for calculating the tourism benefits are \nsummarized in Table A3.2. \n \nTable A3.2: Assumptions in Calculating Tourism Benefits  \nTourists    2003- 2006- 2010- 2013- 2017-2025 \nin 2002  2005  2009  2012  2016 \n20,000  Without  Annual Tourist Growth Rate (%)  35  16  12  10  8 \nProject   Tourist Stay (days)  3.5  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0 \nTourist Spending ($/day)  75  75  75  75  75 \nWith  Annual Tourist Growth Rate (%)  n.a.  20  15  12  10 \nProject  Tourist Stay  (days)  n.a.  3.5  3.5  3.5  3.5 \nTourist Spending ($/day)  n.a.  76.5  76.5  76.5  76.5 \nn.a. = not applicable; 2003\u20132005 are Project implementation period. \nSource: Master Plan for Tourism Development in the Coastal Zone (2002) and Asian Development Bank staff \nestimates. \n \n                                                 \n3  The major assumptions and estimations in this economic analysis are made based mainly on the Mekong Lancang \nRiver Tourism Planning Study, which was completed in 1998 with ADB\u2019s support and other previous studies done \nby ADB and Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in the tourism sector. \n4  Master Plan for Tourism Development in the Coastal Zone (2002).

The subproject will also generate health benefits for local residents and domestic tourists \nvisiting  Sihanoukville  as  well  as  environmental  benefits  such  as  the  preservation  and \nconservation  of  species.  However,  these  benefits are not included in the analysis due to \ndifficulties in valuation and lack of data.   \n12.  The economic analysis for the subproject is summarized in Table A3.3. The reevaluated \nEIRR is 16.4%. Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis \nand the consequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% increase in the project \ncost; (ii) 10% decrease in the tourist arrivals, (iii) 10% decrease in the tourist spending, (iv) \ntourist stay in Sihanoukville reduced by half a day, and (v) project benefits delayed by 1 year. \nThe results show that the EIRR is most sensitive to delays in project benefits. However, all \nEIRRs  remain  over  12%  and  the  plausible  ranges  of  variability  of  the  tested \nparameters/variables are well within the switching values calculated under the sensitivity tests, \nindicating the economic viability of the subproject.  \n \nTable A3.3: Economic Analysis for Sihanoukville Wastewater Management \n \nSensitivity Test \nItem    Appraisal Reappraisal Cost  Tourist  Tourist  Tourist Stay  Implementation \nArrival  Spending  Delayed by \n+ 10%  -0.5 day \n\u201310%  \u201310%  1 year \nEIRR (%)  22.2  16.4%  15.4  15.3  15.2  15.3  14.2 \nSI          2.0  2.9  3.0  2.0     \nSV (%)          49.7  -34.6  -33.2  -1.7     \nPlausible Range         (0~10%) (-15%~15%) (-5%~10%) (0~0.5)days   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  25 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n1.  Financial analyses were prepared for the water supply and sewerage components of the \nProject in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Framework for the Economic and \nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Financial internal rates of return \n(FIRRs) were calculated and sensitivity analyses were carried out. Financial projections for the \nwaterworks  and  the  wastewater  management  system  are  included  in  the  supplementary \nappendixes. The analyses used May 2003 constant prices. \n \nB.  Financial Viability of Water Supply Subprojects \n2.  All capital cost estimates are based on the winning bid price. Financial projections of \noperating entities are made in local prices, and an annual escalation factor of 3.5% per annum \nwas applied to the estimates. The unaccounted-for water is to be reduced from the current 55% \nof water produced to 30% by 2006. Among the project towns, the average water tariff in 2006 \nwill vary from KR1,210 to KR1,544 per cubic meter (m3) (in constant May 2003 prices). \n \n3.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures include personnel, energy, chemicals, \nrepair  and  maintenance,  administration,  miscellaneous,  and  depreciation  expenses.  The \nnumber of personnel varies between 4 and 8 employees per 1,000 connections, which is \nconsidered  reasonable.  The  average  monthly  personnel  cost  ranges  from  KR70,000  to \nKR200,000 based on each project town\u2019s existing level. Energy consumption varies between \nKR150 to KR335 per cubic meter (m3) of treated water, depending on the distance and type of \nwater sources. Chemical cost varies from KR20 to KR80 per m3 of treated water, depending on \nthe type and quality of water sources. Repairs and maintenance are estimated at 2% of the \ninvestment  costs.  Administration  costs  are  estimated  at  5%  of  operating  revenues,  while \nmiscellaneous  expenses  are  estimated  at  5%  of  the  combined  cash  operating  costs. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using 4% of the historical cost of depreciable \nfixed assets used in operations. \n \n4.  For  financial  viability  analysis,  FIRR,  which  is  the  discount  rate  that  equalizes  the \npresent  values  of  costs  and  revenues  over  the  project  life,  was  calculated.  The  analysis \nconsidered incremental capital and operational costs, as well as incremental income. While the \nconstruction is expected to be completed in 2005, a significant increase in the volume of water \nsold can be achieved starting from 2003 as a result of the leakage detection and monitoring \nprogram. Tariffs were set such that the average monthly expenditure on water of a household \nwith a pipe connection would be about 4% of the average monthly household income in all \nproject towns. All households using a public selling point would spend less than 3% of their \naverage monthly household income on water. The FIRRs are more sensitive to a change in \nrevenue than to changes in O&M cost. The FIRRs with the associated sensitivity tests are given \nin Table A4.1. With the implementation of the planned financial measures, all towns will be in a \nposition to sustain the subprojects. Projected financial statements for the waterworks indicate \nthat all water supply subprojects will achieve full cost recovery and, after project completion, will \ngenerate positive cash flows from operations. \n \n \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nTable A4.1: Financial Evaluation and Sensitivity Analyses of Water Supply Subprojects \n \nFIRR, SI  Base  Capital Cost  O&M Cost  Benefits  Benefits \nTown  and SV  Case  + 10%  + 10%  \u201310%  Delayed \nby 1 Year \n             \nAll Towns Combined  FIRR (%)  6.7  5.8  6.1  5.1  5.4 \n  SI    0.8  1.1  2.9   \n  SV (%)    131.4  88.1  (34.5)   \nBattambang  FIRR (%)  8.6  7.5  7.7  6.4  6.7 \n  SI    1.8  2.2  5.0   \n  SV (%)    54.9  46.2  (20.1)   \nKampot  FIRR (%)  3.3  2.5  2.6  1.8  2.3 \n  SI    (11.8)  (8.5)  (19.3)   \n  SV (%)    (8.5)  (11.7)  5.2   \nKompong Cham  FIRR (%)  7.8  7.0  7.4  6.5  6.6 \n  SI    1.6  1.2  3.8   \n  SV (%)    62.4  82.2  (26.2)   \nKompong Thom  FIRR (%)  7.9  7.1  7.3  6.4  6.5 \n  SI    1.7  1.6  4.2   \n  SV (%)    60.2  64.1  (23.7)   \nPursat  FIRR (%)  5.8  5.0  5.1  4.1  4.5 \n  SI    4.0  4.2  9.2   \n  SV (%)    24.9  23.7  (10.8)   \nSvay Rieng  FIRR (%)  6.0  5.3  5.6  4.7  4.9 \n  SI    3.5  2.4  6.9   \n  SV (%)    28.9  41.6  (14.6)   \n             \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching \nvalue. \nSource: Staff consultant estimates. \n \nC.  Water Tariff Structure and Affordability to Households \n5.  The Government has agreed that costs related to water supplies will be recovered \nthrough direct user charges, which will be set at a level affordable to the poorer sections of the \ncommunity. The current and proposed water tariffs in the six towns are shown in Table A4.2. \nThe water tariffs in 2006 range from KR1,210 to KR1,544 per m3 of water consumed, in \nconstant 2003 prices. \n \nTable A4.2: Current and Proposed Water Tariffs  \n(KR/m3) \n \nHousehold Connection    Public Selling Point \n2006 Tariff  2006 Tariff \nTown  Current  Current \nConstant  Current    Constant  Current \nTariff  Tariff \n2003 Prices  Prices  2003 Prices  Prices \nBattambang  1,400  1,388  1,512    ?   1,388  1,512 \nKampot  1,200  1,533  1,670    ?   1,533  1,670 \nKompong Cham  550  1,210  1,318    1,500  1,210  1,318 \nKompong Thom  1,000  1,536  1,673    ?   1,536  1,673 \nPursat  800  1,396  1,521    2,500  1,396  1,521 \nSvay Rieng  900  1,544  1,682    2,500  1,544  1,682 \n?=  not availa ble \nSource: Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy and staff consultant estimates. \n \n6.  The socioeconomic survey results indicated that (i) most households in the target areas \nplace water supply as their top priority, with sewerage/sanitation always in the top three; and (ii) \nhouseholds are willing to pay a market rate for water. With the tariff proposed under the Project, \nall households receiving piped water will be paying less than the market rate and within their ", "  Appendix 4  27 \naffordability levels. All consumers obtaining water from public selling points, which generally \ninclude the poorer sections of the community, will be paying less than 3% of their monthly \nhousehold  income  and  substantially  less  than  from  alternative  sources.

Wastewater Management System in Sihanoukville  \n \n7.  The  component  will  provide  essential  sewerage  system  to  the  built-up  areas  of \nSihanoukville and protect important natural beach and seafront areas. These areas are vital to \npreserve and revitalize the town's tourism industry. Based on the present value of the winning \nbid price for capital works, the estimated O&M costs, and incremental sewage generated, the \naverage incremental financial cost (AIFC) was calculated to determine the tariff required for full \ncost recovery over the expected life of the project assets. If only half of the system will be \nconstructed and operated due to nonavailability of supplementary financing, the AIFC was \ncalculated at $1.06 per m3 of wastewater treated. Under the complete system, the AIFC was \ncalculated at $0.84 per m3 of wastewater treated. \n \n8.  The proposed tariff to be applied to households, however, will be less than the AIFC on \naccount of cross-subsidies from high-volume water consumers (brewery, hotels, restaurants, \netc.). The proposed wastewater tariff for these high-volume water consumers will be less than \nthe cost of on-site treatment. To recover fully the O&M and depreciation costs by year 2009 \nunder the complete system, the household charges in 2009 are estimated to be KR3,674 per \nmonth (1% of average monthly income for low-income households) and KR8,053 per month \n(1.5% of average monthly income for middle-income households), in constant May 2003 prices. \nThe proposed tariff will therefore be affordable to the users. The household survey found that \n78% of the households interviewed were willing to pay an average of KR145,340 for a sewerage \nconnection.  \n \n9.  The  projected  financial  statements  under  the  complete  system  indicate  that  the \nproposed tariff will fully cover O&M and depreciation costs by 2009 and will generate positive \ncash flows from operations to enable the operating entity to expand its collection network using \nits internally generated funds. The projected financial statements indicate that, if only half of the \nsystem will be constructed and operated, full cost recovery will be achieved only by year 2015 \nand internal cash generation capacity is much lower. ", "28  Appendix 4 \nE.  Subsidies and Cost Recovery \n10.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  on  full  cost  recovery  basis  without  Government \nsubsidies. Water tariffs in the six provincial towns will be gradually increased over 2004-2006. \nBy the end of 2006, the tariffs in all the six provincial towns will be sufficient to cover O&M plus \ndepreciation. Similarly, wastewater tariffs in Sihanoukville will be increased over 2006-2009. By \nthe end of 2009, the wastewater tariffs in Sihanoukville will be sufficient to cover O&M plus \ndepreciation for the wastewater management system.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  29 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

The  Project  aims  to  improve  and  sustain  the  water-related  urban  facilities  in  the \nprovincial towns of Battambang, Kampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay \nRieng, and the municipality of Sihanoukville. Environmental improvement and protection are \nmajor project objectives. The Project is classified as environment category B, as per the Asian \nDevelopment Bank's (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for Environmental Assessment of Project Impacts. As \nan  integral  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were carried out following ADB's guidelines. The IEEs are based on an \nanalysis of the impacts of the proposed works, the socioeconomic survey conducted during \nproject preparation, and a visual assessment of the project towns. The IEEs analyzed the likely \nenvironmental consequences and impacts of implementing water supply, wastewater treatment, \nand sanitation improvements in the project towns. The IEEs are reviewed and updated during \nreappraisal of the Project, based on information collected in the course of engineering design. \nThis summary is based on the updated IEEs of the Project. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project consists of a package of components that cover water supply, sanitation, \nand sewage treatment. A detailed description of the Project is given in the main text. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n  1.  Physical Resources \n \n3.  The project towns are widely scattered. Most are within the Mekong River catchment \narea, while Kampot and Sihanoukville are on the coast. All towns experience a pronounced wet \nand dry season.  \n \n  2.  Ecology \n \n4.  There are no known endangered varieties of flora, or species of fish or fauna in the \nimmediate project areas. The project components are in urban areas that are surrounded by \nrural areas dominated by rice fields and forests. \n \n  3.  Human and Economic Development \n \n5.  The project towns are comparatively underdeveloped. Town centers are characterized \nby continuous rows of one or two story buildings with some form of commercial activity taking \nplace in most properties along the main streets. Water supply systems exist in most centers, but \nthe extent of coverage is poor. Gross evidence of fecal matter and sewage is observed in storm-\nwater drains, which overflow during the wet season, spilling sewage into the streets and around \nhouses. Many roadside drains are filled with stagnant, black, putrid water, and choked with solid \nwaste. Foul odors from pit latrines and drains are common. \n \n  4.  Items of Archaeological Significance \n \n6.  Some project towns include sites of historic and cultural importance such as temples, \nand  residential,  commercial,  or  administrative  buildings  from  the  colonial  era.  Project \nimplementation will not negatively affect these sites.  \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 6 \n  5.  Quality of Life \n \n7.  The project towns are semirural in character, with relatively low population densities. \nThey do not exhibit many of the social problems associated with high-density urban areas. \nAlthough average incomes are very low, they are increasing and income disparity within the \ntowns is relatively low for most of the population. The Government still employs large numbers \nof people, but the private sector is offering increasing employment opportunities. Improvements \nare being made to housing conditions as some progress is made on housing ownership. Urban \nservices, however, are basic and coverage is low. Employment and basic needs are important \nto most people in the towns, who are striving and working for improved standards of living. \nRecreation and leisure activities are not a major concern of the communities in general. \n \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Water Supply Improvements \n \na.  Project Location \n \n8.  Works  involve  mostly  (i)  upgrading  the  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  and \nreticulation systems; and (ii) expanding reticulation systems to urban areas not currently served \nwith water. However, new treatment plants will be built in Battambang and Kampong Thom, and \nnew  water  intakes  in  Battambang  and  Pursat.  Two  pieces  of  land  are  required,  one  for \nconstructing the new water intake in Pursat, and one for a new treatment plant in Kampong \nThom. A short resettlement plan has been prepared and implemented. \n \nb.  Design Aspects \n \n9.  Water supply improvements are designed to ultimately provide a 24-hour supply of \ntreated water to a vastly enlarged section of the urban population in six provincial towns. At the \nsame time, the works will substantially reduce the volume of unaccounted-for water. Chlorine \nwill be used in the systems for disinfection.  \n \nc.  Construction Stage \n \n10.  No unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during the construction \nof this component. Work will be undertaken primarily in the dry season, but restored trenches \nwill need to be monitored in the wet season. Excavation for pipelines will disrupt traffic, but \ndisruption will be confined to short periods at any given location. \n \nd.  Operations Stage \n \n11.  Regular training and maintenance are necessary to achieve full environmental benefit \nfrom the water supply component. Full benefits will only be achieved if the system operates \nunder pressure for 24 hours a day, and adequate testing is done at the treatment plants and \nthroughout the distribution system. Training of operators and new testing equipment will be \nprovided in the Project.  \n \ne.  Critical Overall Environmental Review \n \n12.  Works proposed are essential for enhancing the quality and the quantity of supplied \nwater in the six towns. Adverse environmental impacts can be eliminated through design \nprovisions although increased water use over the long term will mean increases in wastewater, \nwhich will need to be taken care of in the future. To ensure that adverse environmental impacts ", "  Appendix 6  33 \nare mitigated during the construction stage, and envisaged environmental benefits are properly \nmonitored, an environmental management plan (EMP) is prepared. \n \n2.  Sihanoukville Wastewater Management System \n \na.  Project Location \n \n13.  Works involve construction of house connections, reticulation pipelines, and a treatment \nplant to provide a sewerage scheme to serve the central area of Sihanoukville. No land is \nrequired for the works in the town except that for the site of the treatment plant. The chosen site \nis Government-owned land, under the control of the municipality. The Project needs to procure \nright-of-way  for  laying  sewers  under  some  private  property.  A  short  resettlement  plan  is \nprepared. \n \nb.  Design Aspects \n \n14.  The sewerage system is designed for a time horizon up to 2015 and can be upgraded at \nthat time. The system will eliminate gross evidence of fecal matter and sewage in the open \nstorm-water drains, foul odors from pit latrines and drains, and pollution of low-lying land and \nbeach frontages. The treatment plant is designed to effectively treat the sewage to a standard \nlevel such that beaches are suitable for primary and secondary contact.  \n \nc.  Construction Stage \n \n15.  No unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during construction. \nWork will be undertaken primarily in the dry season, but restored trenches will need to be \nmonitored in the wet season. Excavation for sewers will cause some traffic disruption. \n \nd.  Operation Stage \n \n16.  Gases in sewers are a potential problem, but they will largely be controlled as the \nmunicipality adopts proper regulations and monitoring. Operators and officials will be trained \nunder  the  Project.  The  Cambreu  Brewery's  wastewater  will  be  pretreated  before  being \ndischarged into the system.  \n \ne.  Critical Overall Environmental Review \n \n17.  The sewerage scheme will significantly reduce the environmental damage currently seen \nin  storm-water  channels,  in  streams,  and  along  the  coast.  The  proposed  plant  is  a  low-\ntechnology system with low operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, but capable of producing \nhigh-quality effluent. To ensure that adverse environmental impacts are mitigated during the \nconstruction stage, and envisaged environmental benefits are properly monitored, an EMP is \nprepared. \n \n3.  Community Sanitation and Health Awareness Program \n \na.  Project Location \n \n18.  This  community-based  program  will  develop  and  strengthen  complementary  and/or \nalternative sanitary delivery systems in project towns. \n \nb.  Design Aspects \n \n19.  Design of the sanitation improvement scheme in each community will be decided upon \nwith the direct involvement of the communities and with guidance from the project consultants. ", "34  Appendix 6 \nCommunity ownership will be enhanced through community in-kind contributions to capital cost \nfor the selected schemes and O&M cost. Health education and community development will be \nprovided.  \n \nc.  Construction Stage \n \n20.  No unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during the construction \nof this component.  \n \nd.  Operation Stage \n \n21.  The communities, through their community sanitation committees to be formed under the \nprogram, will take full responsibility for O&M.  \n \ne.  Critical Overall Environmental Review \n \n22.  The program will significantly reduce environmental damage caused by inappropriate \ndisposal of human waste in the project towns. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n23.  The project management units in the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy and \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport will ensure monitoring of environmental impacts during \nthe construction stage of the Project. The provincial water works in the six towns and the \nwastewater management system to be established in Sihanoukville will monitor environmental \nimpacts during the operational stage of the Project. The Project will support upgrading of the \nwater testing laboratories in Battambang, Kampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, \nand Svay Rieng, and incorporation of a small testing facility at the Sihanoukville wastewater \ntreatment plant. The Project encourages the formation of community sanitation committees to \nsupervise, contract, manage, and carry out the low-cost sanitation program. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n24.  The Project is designed to improve and sustain the urban environment in the project \ntowns. Within the scope of the project components it will help these urban areas cope with the \ndevelopment and population pressures that will arise as urbanization increases.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n25.  The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact, but will result in \noverall and numerous environmental improvements. An environmental impact assessment is \nnot considered necessary.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  35 \nDETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES  \n(in $ million) \n \n  Item    Original Estimates    Revised Cost Estimates \n        Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total \n        Exchange  Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
