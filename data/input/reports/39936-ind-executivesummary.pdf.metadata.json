This business accounted for approximately 93% \nof the company\u2019s total revenue in fiscal year 2006.  \n \nLeveraging  on  its  experience  in  infrastructure  equipment \nfinancing  and  the  absence  of  players  focused  on  small  to \nmedium  sized  infrastructure  projects,  SREI  has  started  to \ndiversify  into  financing  of  smaller  infrastructure  projects.  By \nraising  funds  for  its  infrastructure  project  financing  division, \nSREI  plans  to  grow  its  market  share  in  infrastructure  project \nfinancing  and,  consequently,  consolidate  its  position  in  the \ninfrastructure  sector  focusing  on  small  and  medium  sized \nprojects.  \n  \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  used  to  fund  small  and  medium-\nsized  private  sector  infrastructure  projects  in  selected  areas \nsuch as roads, power, and ports. \n \nSREI  is  a  private  sector  non-bank  finance  company  (NBFC) \nowned  by  foreign  institutions  (34.03%),  promoters  (20.08%), \nthe Indian public (25.73%), private corporate bodies (16.89%), \nand  mutual  funds  (2.10%).  Foreign  institutional  investors \ninclude  shares  underlying  the  global  depository  receipt  issue \n(4.05%).   \n \nSREI  also  benefits  from  financial  assistance  provided  by \ninternational development institutions such as the International \nInvestment \nFinance  Corporation \nOrganization \n(BIO),  Deutsche  Entwicklungsgesellschaft \n(DEG),  and  Nederlandse  Financierings-Maatschappij  voor \nOntwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO).  \n \n\nthe  Belgian \n\n(IFC), \n\n\f \nJustification \n\nLoan Terms \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nlocal \n\ninvestors \n\ninstitutional \n\nfocus  on  small  and  medium-sized \n\nADB\u2019s  resources  for  financing  private  sector  infrastructure \nprojects  are  limited.  The  proposed  loan  to  SREI  presents  an \nopportunity  for  ADB  to  leverage  these  resources  in  India, \nwhere  infrastructure  sector  demand  is  huge  and  public  funds \nare short.  SREI is one of the few financial institutions in India \nfocusing  on  the  infrastructure  sector  financing,  especially  on \nthe  smaller  transactions.  To  match  the  5  to  10-year  tenor  of \nthe  infrastructure  project  financing  business,  SREI  requires \nsimilar  tenor  liabilities.  SREI\u2019s  present  size  and  short  track \nrecord  in  project  financing  limits  its  ability  to  issue  debt  with \ntenor  over  5  years  in  the  local  and  international  capital \nmarkets. \n \nSREI\u2019s \ninfrastructure \nprojects  will  improve  funding  availability  to  sections  of  the \nIndian  economy  left  underserved  by  the  large  commercial \nbanks.   \n \nThe project also aims to catalyze long-term funding from other \nin  SREI, \ninternational  and \nparticularly in the area of infrastructure project financing where \nit competes with larger financial institutions. \n \nIndirectly, the success of SREI will (i) demonstrate the viability \nof  private  sector  participation  in  small  and  medium-sized \ninfrastructure  projects,  (ii)  create  jobs  for  SREI  and  its \ncustomers,  (iii)  support  India\u2019s  economic  growth  through \ninfrastructure development, and (iv) set a model private sector \ninstitution dedicated to infrastructure sector financing for India \nand other developing member countries to emulate. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  in  local  currency.  Additional  local \ncurrency  funding  is  expected  to  be  raised  in  2006,  either \nthrough  the  issue  of  a  new  ADB  bond  or  via  a  swap \ntransaction.  Principal  repayment  will  be  amortized.  The \nmaximum  tenor  of  the  loan  will  not  exceed  10  years.  The \ninterest  rate  will  be  the  market  rate  for  this  type  of  borrower \nand instrument.  \n \n \nThe loan will be structured in two tranches. The proposed loan \nwill  be  secured  by  a  first  charge  over  all  the  assets  and \nreceivables financed out of the loan. \n \nThe main risks are: (i) inability to repay interest and principal, \n(ii)  default  by  SREI\u2019s  borrowers  and/or  construction  delays  of \nfunded loans, (iii) changes in the regulatory environment, and \n(iv) inability to access debt. \n \nThese risks are mitigated by (i) the management\u2019s knowledge \n\n\fand  experience  in  the  infrastructure  sector,  (ii)  SREI\u2019s  track \nrecord in meeting its debt obligations; (iii) demonstrated lower \nthan  industry  average  non-performing  loan  ratio,  and  (iv) \nenhancement of SREI\u2019s credit risk management policy. \n \nSREI  has  been  classified  as  a  financial intermediary  (FI)  with \nrespect  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.
