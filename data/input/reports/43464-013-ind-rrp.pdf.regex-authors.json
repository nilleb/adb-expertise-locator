I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Clean  Energy \nTransmission Investment Program.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA)  for  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Capacity  Development  and  Implementation \nSupport, and if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The investment program will fund electric transmission system upgrades and expansion \nin the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. Outputs will be new transmission substations and high \nvoltage transmission lines. A capacity development component will benefit the state\u2019s recently \nformed,  stand-alone  transmission  utility,  H.P.  Power  Transmission  Corporation  Limited \n(HPPTCL), and thus assist the state to achieve its power sector reform objectives, which include \nthe formation of an independent transmission utility.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Background. Himachal Pradesh, a small mountainous state with a population of slightly \nover 6.8 million, has abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state \nfrom the western Himalayas. The hydropower generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is \nabout 23,000 megawatts (MW)\u2014about one-fourth of the total hydropower potential of India. \nPower generation capacity located within Himachal Pradesh consists solely of hydropower, with \nabout 6,256 MW of capacity installed as of December 2010. In its Hydropower Policy, 2006,3 the \nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) targets its comparative advantage in hydropower \nwith the goal to become the \u2015hydropower state\u2016 of the country. This development will not only \nbenefit Himachal Pradesh, but will provide a clean indigenous source of energy to assist in \nmeeting the country\u2019s rapidly increasing energy demand resulting from its high economic growth \nand aim to provide electricity for all its citizens. \n \n4.  Sector road map and investment program. The state\u2019s power sector road map covers \npower generation, transmission and distribution, regulatory matters, and capacity building. The \nroad map\u2019s emphasis is to encourage investment in hydropower generation\u2014the majority of \nwhich are run-of-river type\u2014and articulates that Himachal Pradesh must build out its electric \ntransmission infrastructure so that the additional hydropower can be efficiently transmitted within \nand outside the state. As Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states in India with 100% \nelectrification at the village level, additional hydropower capacity will not just serve the state\u2019s \ngrowing demand, but will serve the national grid through interstate power flows. As a subset of \nthe  overall  sector  road  map,  and  with  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nHPPTCL  has  prepared  a  power  system  master  plan  to  articulate  a  transmission  network \nexpansion  plan  for  Himachal  Pradesh. 4 This  plan,  endorsed  by  India\u2019s  Central  Electricity \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Project preparatory TA for the investment program was provided. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to India for the \nHimachal Pradesh Clean Energy Transmission Investment Program, Manila (TA 7771-IND, for $500,000, approved \non 11 January).            \n3  GOHP. 2006. Hydro Power Policy, 2006. Shimla. \n4  ADB. 2010. Capacity Building - Power Sector Agencies - A Power System Master Plan for Himachal Pradesh. \nManila\u2014funded under a component of ADB. 2008.  Technical Assistance to India for Capacity Building for \nHimachal Pradesh Power Sector Agencies. Manila (TA 7181-IND). ", "2 \nAuthority  (CEA),  provides  a  sound  basis  for  investment  in  transmission  facilities,  and  is \nexpected to engender confidence among existing and potential private hydropower developers \nthat  sufficient  transmission  capacity  will  be  available  to  evacuate  power  from  hydropower \nfacilities to markets outside of Himachal Pradesh. The investment program thus consists of \ntransmission system investments required through 2016, and a capacity development program \nfor  HPPTCL  to  help  corporatize  the  state  transmission  utility  as  a  stand-alone  entity\u2014a \nrequirement of the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \n5.  Strategic  context. The  road  map  and  investment  program  are  consistent  with  the \ndevelopment goals and strategies of the Government of India and ADB. The government\u2019s \nEleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012, includes increased infrastructure investment as a key for \npromoting broad-based economic growth, and advocates expanded use of renewable energy \nresources to increase energy security and improve energy efficiency in the economy. ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy5 includes increasing energy security needs and facilitating a transition to low \ncarbon economies by promoting increased renewable energy in the region\u2019s energy mix. Since \nthe  investment  program\u2019s  transmission  capacity  additions  support  further  hydropower \ndevelopment in Himachal Pradesh, the investment program indirectly contributes to a reduction \nin the carbon intensity of India\u2019s power supply mix. The road map and investment program are \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012, which supports expanded \nand optimized transmission systems and institutional strengthening.6 \n \n6.  Policy framework. The Integrated Energy Policy, 2006 advocates optimizing the power \nsupply mix, including greater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy. \nPolicies  specifically  related  to  hydropower  promotion  include  the  50,000  MW  Hydropower \nInitiative, 2003 and the New Hydro Policy, 2008. At the state level, the GOHP\u2019s Hydropower \nPolicy, 2006 targets the hydropower resources in the state and promotes hydropower project \ndevelopment and its enabling infrastructure, including the transmission system. \n \n7.  The Electricity Act, 2003 is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector in India, and \nrequires integrated utility companies to unbundle into separate generation, transmission, and \ndistribution  entities.  In  2006,  the  GOHP  formed  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation \nLimited as the state\u2019s generating company, and in 2008 formed the HPPTCL as a stand-alone \ntransmission utility company. The old Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board has become a \ncorporation  and  will  serve  as  the  state\u2019s  distribution  utility.  While  this  process  has  been \nprogressing since 2006, the legal order issued on 10 June 2010 formally recognized HPPTCL \nas the state transmission utility. The state also has an independent regulator since 2000, \nHimachal Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (HPERC), which determines tariffs and \nregulates these new entities in accordance with regulatory guidelines from the Central Electricity \nRegulatory Commission. \n \n8.  Rationale  for  ADB  partnership  and  multitranche  financing  facility.  The  MFF \nsupports a well-defined investment program underpinned by continued institutional reform and a \ndelineated  sector  road  map.  The  state\u2019s  investment  program  objectives  require  a  flexible \nmodality that allows financing of individual investments as projects and conditions warrant, by \nlinking financing to project readiness and capacity. The MFF is a suitable modality as it provides \nup-front  support  to  the  GOHP  for  its  substantial  development  program,  but  with  financial \ncommitments  sequenced  to  match  project  readiness.  As  the  sequenced  investments  are \nimplemented, expertise will build over time and will allow future projects to benefit directly from \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "3 \nimplementation  experience  gained  from  the  initial  investments  and  from  the  capacity \ndevelopment component. It also allows ADB to engage with the GOHP in a continuous long-\nterm dialogue consistent with the clean energy policies of the Government of India and ADB. \n \n9.  Lessons.  A  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  on  the  energy  sector  in  India, \nconducted in 2007, identifies lessons learned from previous ADB assistance.7 Lessons identified \ninclude (i) ADB\u2019s approach to lending at the state level has worked well and should be used as \na model for future assistance, (ii) sustained TA is needed to support state-level sector goals, \nand (iii) corporatization is providing benefits similar to those normally attributed to privatization \nby introducing commercially and financially sustainable principles and better governance into \nstate entities. These experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the proposed \nMFF, including TA and capacity development for the state transmission utility. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  that  the  Himachal  Pradesh  power  sector \ntransmits clean energy to end users in Himachal Pradesh and the rest of India. The outcome will \nbe  that  HPPTCL  has  sufficient  assets  and  capacity  to  support  its  mandate  as  the  state \ntransmission utility company. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The investment program\u2019s outputs will include two major areas: (i) physical investments \nin transmission infrastructure, including high voltage lines and transmission substations; 8 and \n(ii) capacity development for the state transmission utility company. The additional transmission \ncapacity to be added by this investment program is sufficient to transmit power to electrify over \n456,000 homes in India, and includes about 125 kilometers of transmission lines and over \n12,000 MW of additional substation capacity. Specifically, the first project of the investment \nprogram will fund the four investment components shown below. \n \n(i)  66/220/400 kilovolts (kV) gas insulated switchgear (GIS) substation at Wangtoo, \nDistrict Kinnaur; \n(ii)  220/400 kV GIS substation near Pragati Nagar, District Shimla; \n(iii)  66/220 kV GIS substation at Bhoktoo, District Kinnaur; and \n(iv)  a  transmission  line  of about  28 kilometers  (220 kV  double  circuit  line) from \nHatkoti to Pragati Nagar, District Shimla. \n \n12.  Future  tranches  are  expected  to  include  nine  additional  substations  and  four \ntransmission lines. Substations include (i) 132/220 kV pooling station at Naggar, (ii) 33/220 kV \npooling station at Lahal, (iii) 66/22 kV pooling station at Kilba, (vi) 132/220 kV pooling station at \nSunda, (v) 220 kV switching station at Hatkoti, (vi) 220/400 kV pooling station at Lahal, (vii) \n132/220 kV pooling station at Koti, (viii) 33/220 kV pooling station at Naggar, and (ix) 33/132 KV \nsubstation at Pandoh. Transmission lines include (i) 220 kV line from Sunda to Hatkoti, (ii)  400 \nkV line from Lahal to Chamera, (iii) 220 kV line from Koti to Koria, and (iv) 220 kV line from \nNaggar to Banala. \n \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2007.

Capacity development activities will strengthen procurement, financial management, and \nproject monitoring capacity; and support HPPTCL staff to manage its growing asset size. It will \nalso  fund  a  computerized  enterprise  resource  planning  solution  covering  accounting  and \nmanagement  information  system  applications;  and  will  finance  the  purchase  of  software, \nhardware, training, and initial system maintenance. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The  GOHP\u2019s  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  about  $438  million.  The \nGovernment of India has requested an MFF in an amount up to $350 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance part of the investment program. The MFF is expected \nto have three tranches, with tranche 1 ($113 million) scheduled for 2011, and two more tranches \nestimated  at  $80  million  and  $157  million  each  for  2012  through  2014,  subject  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan \nand  project  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. Individual loans will include taxes \nand duties for the investment components,9 as well as imbedded costs in supply and erection \ncontracts such as transport (including local transport), freight, and insurance costs. The central \ngovernment  will  make  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  in  each  tranche  available  to  the  state \ngovernment, which will relend the proceeds to HPPTCL, in each case on terms and conditions \nconsistent with Indian legislation and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n      Amount   \nItem    MFF    Tranche 1   \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  HPPTCL will be the executing agency as well as the implementing agency for the \ninvestment program, responsible for supervising subproject implementation and monitoring of \nsubproject operational performance. For these purposes, HPPTCL has established a project \nmanagement unit located at HPPTCL\u2019s headquarters in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. The project \nmanagement unit is headed by a project director, and includes staff located at headquarters and \nin the field at project sites. As HPPTCL was established in 2008 as part of the unbundling of the \nformer state integrated utility company (Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board), HPPTCL \nretains staff and considerable transmission system planning and operational experience from \nthe  Himachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board,  and  currently  has  130  employees.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility \nadministration manual (FAM).10 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2011\u2013December 2017 \nEstimated completion date  December 2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Board of Directors of HPPTCL (chaired by chief secretary, GOHP) \n(ii)  Executing agency  HPPTCL \n(iii)  Implementing agency  HPPTCL \n(iv)  Implementation unit  HPPTCL Shimla headquarters, 8 staff \nProcurement (tranche 1)  International competitive  5 contracts  $99.5 million \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding  0 contracts  $0 \nShopping  Various contracts  $50,000 \nConsulting services (MFF)  QCBS  0 person-months   \nIndividual  43 person-months  $500,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advanced contracting for procurement and consulting services \nadvance contracting  Retroactive financing for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures \nincurred up to 12 months before loan signing \n   \n                                                \n10  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOHP = Government of Himachal Pradesh, HPPTCL = H.P.

The  TA  for  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Capacity  Development  and \nImplementation  Support,  with  a  total  cost  of  $650,000,  is  included  in  the  2011  country \noperations  business  plan.11 ADB  will  fund  $600,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and HPPTCL will provide $50,000 in kind in the \nform of office accommodation, transport, and other support services. The TA is attached to the \nloan and will support HPPTCL in the preparation of future subprojects under the investment \nprogram, provide technical support, and assist in project implementation.12 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n19.  All investment projects under the investment program will be subject to rigorous scrutiny, \nas they are first examined by HPPTCL and then by the CEA for their technical, economic, and \nfinancial  feasibility.  ADB  will  also  review  all  aspects,  including  visiting  sites,  reviewing  all \navailable  reports,  and  undertaking  a  comprehensive  due  diligence  assessment,  including \nsafeguard aspects, and technical, financial, and economic viability. \n \nA.  Technical \n20.  All proposed transmission system components within the investment program are part of \nthe power system master plan (footnote 4), which was endorsed by the CEA. This plan included \nseveral interrelated elements, including forecasting power demand growth, distribution system \nplanning, formulating the generation expansion plan, the river basin plan, and the transmission \nsystem expansion plan. The design of the electricity infrastructure considered the security and \nreliability of the electricity supply via the transmission system, and involved a long-term view in \ndetermining least-cost options for optimizing the system. \n \n21.  ADB  has  reviewed  and  confirmed  the  technical  viability  of  the  tranche  1  loan \ninvestments. Project designs are consistent with overall least-cost expansion plans; and reflect \nbest-practice design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) features. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The principles set by HPERC as the regulatory agency define the \nbasis on which revenue will be generated from transmission assets. The transmission tariff \npricing  regime  (the  aggregate  revenue  requirement  or  \u2015aggregate  revenue  requirement\u2016 \napproach) transfers all but operational risk away from the transmission licensee (HPPTCL) by \nensuring that costs are recovered against approved investments and that investments earn a \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2010.

Volume risk is borne by transmission customers (i.e., distribution \nlicensees  and  ultimately  end-use  customers  at  the  state  level).  The  aggregate  revenue \nrequirement, which will be confirmed by HPERC, will recover the full cost of loan capital by way \nof accelerated depreciation (to cover  the bulk of principal repayments over 12 years) and \ninterest, return on equity, O&M expenses, and interest on working capital. \n \n23.  Financial analysis of all tranches under the investment program will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.13 Financial viability will \nbe examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \u2015with-investment\u2016 and \n\u2015without-investment\u2016 scenarios. Cost streams used for financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \ndetermination  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits,  and  include  capital \ninvestment, income tax, and O&M. Benefits flow to HPPTCL through revenue accruing from \ntariffs earned from transmission of electricity through the transmission assets. The investment\u2019s \nFIRR will be compared to the weighted average cost of capital of the proposed investments to \nHPPTCL. Sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions will also \nbe assessed. For the tranche 1 project, the FIRR of 6% exceeded the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 4.3%, so the tranche 1 investments are deemed financially viable.14 \n \n24.  Economic analysis. Projects financed by the investment program, as part of the state\u2019s \npower system master plan, are integral components of the least-cost plan to achieve desired \nlong-term outcomes for power system expansion in Himachal Pradesh. A time-slice approach \nwas adopted for detailed economic cost\u2013benefit analysis, considering the entire power system \nmaster plan\u2019s generation and transmission investment plans, 2012\u20132016. This was done to \navoid  the  difficulties  inherent  in  allocating  costs  and  particularly  benefits  to  individual \ntransmission components in an increasingly interconnected network. \n \n25.  Electricity generated and transmitted from hydropower assets built under the master \nplan will be used to meet any unserved demand for electricity in Himachal Pradesh and the \nnorthern region of the national grid. When there is no unserved demand, this electricity will \ndisplace more expensive sources of generation in the northern region\u2014primarily diesel captive \nplants and coal-fired plants. Non-incremental outputs from the investment program are valued at \nthe resource cost savings that would accrue if the  investment plan proceeds. Incremental \noutputs  are  valued  using  Himachal  Pradesh  and  northern  region  consumers\u2019  estimated \nwillingness to pay for incremental consumption, adjusted for medium voltage and low voltage \nlosses as appropriate. The basis for economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs \nbetween the with- and without-investment scenarios. Investment is assumed to take place \nduring 2012\u20132016, and benefits are assumed to be realized progressively from 2013. The \ndetailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that the overall investment master plan is economically \nviable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 24.9%. This robust return reflects \nthe high economic value of hydropower in India.15 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  A  governance  assessment  of  HPPTCL  included  public  financial  management, \nprocurement activities, and anticorruption measures. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n14 Financial Analysis: Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Economic Analysis: Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n27.  Public  financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  evaluated \nHPPTCL\u2019s  ability  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  investment  program.  The \nassessment was in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects \nusing  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field  interviews.  HPPTCL \naccounts  are  audited  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general  of  India,  the  supreme  audit \nauthority in India. In addition, HPPTCL has engaged a chartered accounting firm as an internal \nauditor since 2009. The accounts personnel are familiar with accounting and different control \naspects in power sector financial management. HPPTCL\u2019s present accounting system in the \ncorporate office is a computerized commercial accounting package. However, as the company \ngrows, further computerization will be required. The tranche 1 loan will fund a computerized \naccounting  management  information  system  that  will  meet  HPPTCL\u2019s  increasing  corporate \naccounting and financial reporting requirements as well as the project level accounting and \nreporting  requirements  under  the  investment  program.  Staff  will  be  trained  in  the  new \ncomputerized  accounting  systems;  corporate  accounting  procedures; and  in  all  appropriate \naccounting, reporting, and audit functions.  Furthermore, HPPTCL staff have participated in \nADB-sponsored loan disbursement seminars. As a consequence of the existing capacity, hiring \nplans, recommended training, and proposed upgrading and computerisation of accounting and \nmanagement  information  systems,  the  project  financial  management  arrangements  are \nconsidered satisfactory. \n \n28.  Procurement. HPPTCL has a procurement unit with a full-time staff of eight personnel, \nheaded by a procurement professional with 20 years of procurement experience. Its tender \ncommittee, which will evaluate bids and make recommendations for award, consists of one \nrepresentative each from (i) the Contract Services Department; (ii) the Materials Management \nServices,  Engineering,  Erection,  and  Construction  Department;  and  (iii)  the  Finance \nDepartment. Proper record-keeping procedures are in place, and HPPTCL\u2019s board of directors \ngrants final approval of all procurement transactions. HPPTCL staff have participated in ADB-\nsponsored procurement seminars, and ADB provided support to HPPTCL in preparing bidding \ndocuments in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  HPPTCL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 10). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Adequate  power  supply  is  essential  to  sustain  economic  growth,  and  regular  and \nefficient power supply is correlated to poverty reduction. Indian states like Gujarat, Haryana, and \nPunjab, with high levels of power generation and consumption, also have lower poverty rates. \nThe benefits of improving the power sector are manifold. Technical developments and reforms \nthat lead to sector sustainability can free up resources for other pro-poor initiatives. Greater and \nmore reliable power supply helps bolster social services, as hospitals, schools, and other social \nentities often suffer most from low-quality power supply and load shedding. Socially, efficient \npower supply increases access to electronic media such as television and radio, allowing a \ngreater understanding of civic affairs and better informed choices. For the economy of India, a \ndeveloped power sector boosts farm mechanization and agricultural yield, and benefits the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  through  business  expansion  and  more  employment \nopportunities. With regular electrification, household and cottage industries would also increase \nand improve. During construction, the investment program is expected to generate employment \nin Himachal Pradesh of both skilled and unskilled labor, which can include women workers. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  An environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and \nindigenous peoples planning framework outline the governing environment and social safeguard \nprinciples and requirements for the projects financed by the investment program.16 HPPTCL will \nundertake environmental and social safeguard due diligence on all projects based on these \nframeworks and submit annual reports on implementation of environmental management plans \n(EMPs) and resettlement plans for projects, and if required, indigenous peoples plans. HPPTCL \nhas its own board-approved safeguards policies: (i) the Environment and Social Safeguards \nPolicy; and (ii) the Resettlement, Relief, Rehabilitation and Compensation Policy. These policies \nwere taken into consideration in preparing the environmental assessment and review framework \nand resettlement framework. \n \n32.  The tranche 1 project is environment category B. The civil construction work is limited to \nbuilding foundations for the transmission towers, and substations, and the tranche 1 project \ndoes  not  come  within  any  environmentally  sensitive  area.  Based  on  the  environmental \nassessment and surveys, associated potential adverse environmental impacts are minimal and \ncan be mitigated through implementation of the EMP. An adequate budgetary provision in the \ntranche 1 project covers the environmental mitigation and monitoring requirements, and the \nEMP is part of the construction contracts. HPPTCL will supervise the construction contracts and \nEMP implementation, and semiannual progress reports of its implementation will be submitted \nto ADB. Overall, the major social and environmental impacts associated with the tranche 1 \nproject are limited to the construction period and can be mitigated to an acceptable level by \nimplementation of recommended engineering measures and environmental practices. Future \ntranches are expected to be environment category B based on investigations conducted to date, \nwhich will be confirmed during detailed due diligence conducted for each tranche. \n \n33.  The tranche 1 project is involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples \ncategory C. Census surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Indicative  and  expected  categorization  for  all  future \ntranches is involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples category C based on \nsubproject reviews to date, which will be confirmed during investment program implementation. \nThe  tranche  1  project  will  entail  minimum  private  land  acquisition.  Of  the  three  proposed \nsubstations, two are to be built on government land, and the third requires 2.5 hectares of \nprivate land. The transmission line will have 76 towers, out of which 63 will be located on \nprivately owned land, 10 towers will be placed on government land, and the remaining three \ntowers will be placed on community land. No structures or buildings will be affected and no \nphysical displacement is foreseen. In total, the tranche 1 project includes the acquisition of 3.65 \nhectares of private land. Regarding gender issues, the loan agreements include a standard \nassurance related to core labor standards for contractors (including equal pay for equal type of \nwork), and an awareness program on HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.17 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The risks are manageable and appropriate \n                                                \n16 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Plan: Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nmitigation measures are incorporated in the investment program design.
