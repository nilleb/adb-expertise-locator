If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2. \nThe loan will support Phu Yen JSC to operate a 257-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic \npower plant and its associated facilities in Phu Yen Province, Viet Nam. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor United States (US) \ndollar-denominated project financing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. The \nfinancing  will  also  catalyze  commercial  cofinancing  for  one  of  the  largest  scale  solar  power \nprojects in Southeast Asia. In addition, ADB\u2019s participation in the project will ensure compliance \nwith  rigorous  environmental  and  social  safeguard  standards,  and  will  enable  gender  design \nfeatures and targets to be incorporated. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n3. \nProject identification. High rates of economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization \nare  leading  to  growing  electricity  demand  in  Viet  Nam,  which  has  become  the  second-largest \npower market in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia). Access to electricity, which was less than 10% \nof the population in 1986, is now nearly universal (99.5% in 2019). Electricity demand has grown \nrapidly, averaging 12.0% per year from 2005 to 2018, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% \nper  year through  2030. However, meeting  fast-growing  electricity  demand  and  sustaining  high \nrates of economic growth will be a significant challenge for Viet Nam. According to the Revised \nNational Power Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132020 (PDP VII), Viet Nam needs to invest about \n$148 billion in power transmission and generation infrastructure from 2016 to 2030.2 Because of \nfinancial  constraints  on  the  state  utility  Vietnam  Electricity  (EVN)  and  limits  on  sovereign \nborrowing, private sector investment will be essential to avoid future power shortages. \n  \n4. \nIn 2018, large hydropower, coal, and gas projects comprised nearly 90% of Viet Nam\u2019s \n54.9 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity. With limited potential remaining to develop large-\nscale  hydropower  plants,  depleting  domestic  coal  reserves,  and  growing  public  concern  over \nenvironmental issues, renewable energy development is receiving greater focus. Viet Nam\u2019s PDP \nVII seeks to increase the share of renewable energy as a percentage of total forecast installed \ncapacity to 21% (27 GW) by 2030 and to reduce the use of imported coal-fired electricity. To meet \nthis target, installed solar power capacity is expected to increase to 12 GW by 2030.  \n \n5. \nIn  April  2017,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  issued  a  decision  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of private sector solar projects. This decision included a provision for a 20-year feed-\nin tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale solar power projects. Although the \nnew FIT policy sparked significant private sector interest, project developers and financiers faced \ntwo  major  challenges.  First,  developers  wishing  to  receive  the  FIT  were  required  to  be \n\n1   Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  Vietnam Electricity. 2016. Revised National Power Development Master Plan 2011\u20132020. Ha Noi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ncommissioned  by  the  end  of  June  2019\u2014a  compressed  development  and  construction  time \nframe. Second, they were required to use the standard power purchase agreement (PPA) issued \nby the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is not considered bankable for international lenders \non  a  nonrecourse  project  finance  basis  due  to  its  lack  of  sufficient  protection  for  curtailment, \nchanges in law, and various termination scenarios. As a result, developers were unable to obtain \nlong-term project financing under these conditions. \n \n6. \nConsequently,  developers  decided  to  proceed  with  project  construction  using  a \ncombination of sponsor equity, short-term supplier credit, or corporate loans with short tenors and \nin local currency (dong). This was considered an interim arrangement for many developers, and \nexperienced  international  developers  such  as  B.Grimm  Power  Public  Company  Limited \n(B.Grimm) continued their efforts to structure more sustainable long-term financing solutions. \n \n7. \nBy  June  2019,  82  solar  power  plants,  with  a  total  capacity  of  nearly  4.5  GW,  were \ncommissioned and connected to the national grid, taking the share of solar power in the country\u2019s \npower mix from less than 0.5% to almost 10.0% in just a few months. This exceeds the target of \n850 MW of solar power by 2020 and 4,000 MW by 2025 set out in PDP VII, but is still below the \n2030 target of 12 GW. However, while the rapid development of solar power capacity is a great \nsuccess in terms of renewable energy development, the need for sustainable financing solutions \nremains of paramount importance to support the sector\u2019s long-term viability and stability. Further, \nrapid development has resulted in network congestion in some areas, and certain projects have \ncurtailment issues because of grid capacity constraints. \n \n8. \nSince 2018, ADB has engaged in discussions with project developers to explore options \nfor financing solutions. Establishing a viable long-term financing structure is critical to support the \nsustainable development of Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector. The ADB approach has been \nto  (i)  selectively  support  high-quality  landmark  projects  developed  by  reputable  sponsors,  and    \n(ii) take the lead in developing a bankable structure to help catalyze commercial bank cofinancing \nto Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector by reducing the market perception that long-term financing \nis not feasible. In late 2018, B.Grimm approached ADB to discuss its development pipeline in Viet \nNam and potential financing structures.3 The projects were considered suitable because of their \nsize and strategic location,4 and B.Grimm\u2019s strong technical capacity and record as a developer. \n  \n9. \nIn response to market conditions and sponsor demand, ADB has developed an innovative \nproject finance solution with tailor-made sponsor support to address the key risks in Viet Nam\u2019s \nstandard  PPA.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  this  project  will  showcase  one  of  the  first  international \nlimited-recourse  financings  for  one  of  the  biggest  solar  power  projects  in  the  country  (and  in \nSoutheast  Asia).  Through  its  B  loan,  ADB  will  also  mobilize  one  of  the  largest  commercial \ncofinancings for a renewable energy project to date in Viet Nam. ADB has led the deal structuring \nand will ensure compliance with rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \n10. \nProject design. The project consists of the development and operation of a 257 MW solar \nphotovoltaic  power  plant  and  its  associated  facilities  in  Phu  Yen  Province.  The  project  is \nconnected to the national grid and has entered into a 20-year PPA with EVN. It will directly serve \nthe  electricity  demand  of  Quang  Ngai  and  Nha  Trang  city  and  surrounding  areas\u2014a  region \nemerging as one of Viet Nam\u2019s key tourist centers where power shortages are likely because of \n\n \n\n3   The  proposed  Phu  Yen  Project  is  one of  two  solar projects  led by  B.Grimm  that  ADB is considering  financing  in \nViet Nam in 2020. The other project, the B.Grimm Viet Nam Solar Project \u2013 Dau Tieng Project, is expected to  be \nprocessed during the second quarter of 2020 and is located in a different province with a different local partner. \n4   The Phu Yen Project is located close to the 220 MW Song Ba Ha hydropower plant which has high complementarity \n\nwith the project during dry seasons.  \n\n\f3 \n\nrapidly  growing  demand.  The  project  achieved  commercial  operation  in  June  2019,  and  its \noperation to date has been on track and without any curtailment.  \n \n11. \nBorrower  and  sponsors.  The  borrower,  Phu  Yen  JSC,  was  established  in  2016  to \ndevelop and operate the project. B.Grimm owns 80% of the borrower while Truong Thanh Viet \nNam Group Joint Stock Company (TTVN) owns the remaining 20%. \n \n12. \nB.Grimm, established in 1993, is one of the largest private power generation companies \namong  Thailand\u2019s  small  power  producer  operators.  As  of  November  2019,  B.Grimm  had  total \ngenerating  capacity  of  2.9 GW  from  a  diversified  portfolio  including  17  gas-fired  co-generation \nplants, 24 solar power plants, and three hydropower plants. As of November 2019, the company \nhad 19 power projects under construction and development, which will raise its total generating \nportfolio  to  3,424  MW  by  2025.  B.Grimm  has  also  established  climate  targets  to  increase  the \nshare of renewable energy as a percentage of installed capacity in its portfolio from 8% in 2017 \nto 30% in 2022. B.Grimm is one of ADB\u2019s largest private sector clients in Thailand; ADB owns \n4.7% shares and, with ADB assistance, it issued Thailand\u2019s first certified climate bond in 2019.5 \n \n13. \nTTVN is a Vietnamese company established in 2012 that is primarily active in real estate \ndevelopment,  with  investments  in  luxury  resorts,  commercial  property,  and  social  housing \nprojects.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  outlines  seven  operational  priorities  to  address  development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.9 It supports two of those priorities: (i) tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(ii) addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequality.  It  also  supports  Strategy  2030\u2019s \nobjectives to expand the role of private sector operations and mobilize additional resources on \ntop of ADB\u2019s own financing. \n \n19. \nADB has long-standing, strong, and successful cooperation with Viet Nam. The project is \naligned with two of the three pillars of the country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020: \n(i)  increasing  the  inclusiveness  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  and  (ii)  improving \nenvironmental  sustainability  and  climate  change  response. 10 The  project  is  also  aligned  with \nViet Nam\u2019s  commitments  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change, \ntargeting a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 8%\u201325% by 2030 (footnote 7). \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects.11 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of $6 billion in annual \nfinancing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020. Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, \nthe  project  benefitted  from  close  cross-departmental  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment in assessing and analyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \nLessons from previous operations.

Manila. \n\n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f5 \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nArrangements \n\nThe project is being implemented under Prime Minister Decision No. 11/2017/QD-\nTTg, which establishes the framework and the standards for implementing solar \npower projects. \nThe main project sponsor, B.Grimm, has extensive experience in the development, \noperation, and maintenance of power projects. \nTo meet the June 2019 deadline for the commercial operation date under the PPA, the \nproject was initially financed with sponsors\u2019 equity and short-term vendor financing.  \n\nConstruction arrangements  The EPC contract for the photovoltaic plant was procured via a competitive bid \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and       \nmaintenance \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nprocess. China Energy, was selected as the contractor.  \nFor the project\u2019s 220-kilovolt substation and 12.2-kilometer transmission line, the EPC \nservices are provided by the ACIT-TEG Consortium.  \nThe EPC contracts are standard fixed-price, date-certain turnkey contracts. \nThe photovoltaic panels were manufactured by JA Solar and Trina Solar. \nThe borrower will sell electricity generated by the project to EVN under a 20-year \npower purchase agreement at a fixed feed-in tariff of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour. The \ntariff is paid in dong but indexed to the United States dollar. ADB will receive sponsor \nsupport to mitigate key risks from Viet Nam\u2019s standard PPA for renewable energy. \nAn O&M contract is signed between the borrower and China Energy, by which China \nEnergy will be responsible for O&M for a period of 2 years. After the expiry of the \ncontract, Phu Yen JSC will continue to outsource O&M through a third party. \nPhu Yen JSC will submit to ADB (i) development effectiveness reports on key \nperformance indicators, (ii) semiannual unaudited and annual audited financial \nstatements, and (iii) environmental and social monitoring reports. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; China Energy = China Energy Engineering Group; EPC = engineering, procurement, \nand  construction;  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance;  PPA  =  power  purchase  agreement;  Shanxi  Electric  Power \nEngineering Co., Ltd.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \n22. \nADB\u2019s assistance will have three components: (i) a direct senior secured loan, A loan, of \nup  to  $27,900,000;  (ii)  a  B  loan  of  up  to  $148,800,000  to  be  funded  by  participating  financial \ninstitutions;  and  (iii)  administration  of  a  parallel  senior  secured  loan  of  up  to  $9,300,000  to  be \nprovided  by  LEAP.  The  A  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \nADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the project commercially \nviable. International lenders are not comfortable offering long-term US dollar-denominated debt \non a nonrecourse basis in the Vietnamese renewables market because of concerns regarding the \nPPA  and  the  nascency  of  the  sector.  Local  banks  are  unable  to  offer  US  dollar-denominated \nlonger  tenor  debt.  As  one  of the first  and  biggest  international  limited-recourse  project finance \ntransactions in Viet Nam\u2019s renewable energy sector, the project will demonstrate the potential for \nprivate  sector  investment  in  the  sector,  send  a  strong  signal  to  the  market,  and  attract  other \ninvestors for similar investments. ADB has led the structuring of the transaction and is crowding \nin commercial banks under the B loan structure, at a cofinancing ratio of $5.3 for every $1 of ADB \nassistance. ADB will offer a longer tenor than participating commercial banks, helping to improve \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ndebt service coverage ratios for lenders and thereby improve the project\u2019s financial viability. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  will  demonstrate  that  innovative  financing  solutions  can \naddress existing challenges in this nascent market. The support also contributes to B.Grimm\u2019s \ntarget of increasing the share of renewable energy in its portfolio. ADB\u2019s involvement and due \ndiligence  will  ensure  that  the  project  is  developed  and  operated  to  international  best  practice \nstandards and will perform to expectations over the project life. ADB\u2019s participation in the project \nwill enable gender design features and targets to be incorporated, and will also ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n25. \nADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B),  and \nindigenous peoples (category B). Safeguard Requirement 4 for existing facilities is applicable.15 \n  \n26. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate for the adverse impacts \nin the safeguard reports and plans. An environmental and social compliance audit was conducted \nin  parallel  by  an  independent  consultant  to  assess  the  project\u2019s  performance  against  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Phu  Yen  JSC  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  required  to  be  enhanced  to  ensure  the  ongoing  management  of \nsafeguards aspects in compliance with ADB SPS requirements. \n \n27. \nEnvironment.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment  report  was  prepared  in \ncompliance  with  Vietnamese  regulations  and  approved  by  the  chair  of  the  Provincial  People\u2019s \nCommittee in July 2018. The project area has moderately flat plain and semi-mountainous terrain. \nThe project, including the transmission line right-of-way, is not located within or adjacent to any \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area.  It  retained  the  original  state  of  undulating  areas  and  streams \nrunning across the site, and did not undertake any ground leveling. The project considered 100-\nyear  floods  in  its  drainage  system  design.  The  independent  audit  observed  gaps  in  the \nenvironment,  health,  and  safety  performance,  including  (i)  the  absence of  a  designated  safety \nofficer; (ii) unsafe practices, such as working at heights without proper protection; (iii) improper \nwaste handling, management, and disposal; (iv) poor housekeeping practices (e.g., waste and \ntrash resulting in partial clogging of drains); and (v) inadequate traffic and security management. \nThe audit also noted the lack of a formal grievance redress mechanism for internal and external \nstakeholders.  Phu  Yen  JSC  has  agreed  to  implement  corrective  actions  to  address  the  gaps \nbefore  the  loan  drawdown.  During  operation,  the  borrower  will  prepare  an  operational \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan  that  will  include  mitigation,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement measures for waste handling, pollution prevention, grievances, health, and safety \nprocedures. It will also work on measures to avoid flooding during typhoon seasons. \n \n\n15 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nSocial. The project is located on about 262 hectares (ha), of which the government leased \n28. \n256 ha to the project for 50 years through the land use rights certificate awarded on 21 June 2019 \nand valid until 5 May 2068. Aside from this, the project directly purchased about 6 ha of land on \na willing seller\u2013willing buyer basis. These have been done in accordance with the expectations of \nthe  affected  land  users.  Before  the  resumption  of  land  rights  (undertaken  before  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement) by the government and the subsequent transfer to the borrower, the land was used \nfor varied agricultural purposes (mostly plantation and single cropping of cassava and sugarcane). \nHowever, the affected land users did not rely heavily on the land for their sustenance or livelihood, \nsince  it  was  not  suitable  for  intensive  agriculture  or  plantation  because  of  poor  soil  quality.  A \nportion of the farmland was also communally owned and included (i) undulating areas and small \nstreams  running  across  the  site,  (ii)  internal  access  roads,  and  (iii) graveyards  for  ethnic \nminorities\u2014the Cham Hoi Roi. Although the affected people were not solely dependent on this \nland  for  their  livelihoods,  the  project\u2019s  land  acquisition  caused  loss  of  or  disruption  to  the \nlivelihoods of nearly 166 households (approximatively 650 persons). The land transfer and lease \nalso  impacted  the  community  graves  of  the  ethnic  minorities  (16  households  comprised  of \napproximatively  64 persons).  In  addition,  it  disrupted  community  access to  areas  adjoining  the \nsolar farm. \n \n29. \nAn  independent  third  party  undertook  an  audit  of  the  land  transfer  and  its  impact  on  \nexisting users. The audit findings suggest that (i) the resumption and transfer of land rights was \ndone in accordance with statutory requirements, (ii) all affected households were compensated \nfor    loss  of  income  resulting  from  loss  of  land  and  other  productive  assets,  (iii)   no  legacy  or \nongoing  encumbrances  or  risks  are  associated  with  project  lands,  and  (iv) the  land  and  asset \ncompensation  process  provided  enhanced  compensation  and  other  benefits  that  exceed  \nstatutory  requirements  and  were  largely  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. To support their transition, 118 of the 166 affected households or approximately \n472 persons were given additional allowances (in the form of compensation and optional training). \n \nAs  mitigation  measures  for  potential  residual  impacts  and  in  accordance  with  the  audit \n30. \nrecommendation, a livelihood restoration plan (LRP) will be prepared and implemented for the \naffected,  vulnerable,  willing  and  suitable  families,  and  a  project  level  grievance  redress \nmechanism will be developed to receive and address potential concerns of the project-affected \npeople by Phu Yen JSC before the first loan disbursement. The LRP will build on the livelihood \nsupport  already  provided  to  affected  households  to  address  the  long-term  impact  of  land  and \nlivelihood  losses.  The  LRP  will  include  an  assessment  of  affected  households\u2019  socioeconomic \ncondition and the provision of opportunities for skills building and alternative livelihoods to ensure \nthe restoration of sustenance and livelihood status to at least pre-project levels. \n \n31. \nThe land acquisition included a communal lot used as a graveyard of the Cham Hoi Roi \nethnic group. A total of 18 graves owned by 16 Cham households were transferred to adjoining \nland parcels next to the site boundary. The audit confirmed that the graveyard was relocated in \naccordance with the sociocultural norms and practices of the Cham people. Land for relocation \n(including additional land for future use) has been allocated to the ethnic community. Extensive \nand culturally oriented engagements (meaningful consultations) with the ethnic group (including \nall affected households) were undertaken by the project team; and compensation rates, timelines, \nand  the  process  of  grave  relocation  were  mutually  agreed  through  these  engagements. \nRepresentatives from the village level commune, the tribal chieftain, tribal mayor, and affected \nhouseholds  expressed  satisfaction  with  the  compensation  and  relocation  process  and  the \ncustomary  and  cultural  sensitivities  shown  by  the  project.  The  project  has  made  additional \ncommitments, including the fencing of the new gravesite, construction of a road, and a bridge for \neasy access to the community graves, which are being implemented. The project will (i) continue \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nto  engage  with  the  ethnic  group  in  a  culturally  appropriate  manner,  and  (ii) provide  economic \nopportunities  (as  part  of  the  larger  livelihood  restoration  measures)  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment to willing and qualified households of this group of ethnic minorities. \n \nEffective Gender Mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n32. \n(1998),  Phu  Yen  JSC  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment  in  its  business  activities.  Key features  of  the  gender  action  plan  are  as follows:      \n(i) an increase in the proportion of women employed by the borrower in technical and supervisory \nroles; (ii) gender equality for jobs in maintenance and cleaning; (iii) an annual internship program \nfor  female  students;  and  (iv) strengthening  of  the  borrower\u2019s  human  resources  policies  and \nprocedures  regarding  equal  pay,  a  better  workplace  environment,  access  to  social  security \nbenefits, and anti-sexual harassment policies and guidelines. Phu Yen JSC will submit periodic \nreports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB.  \n \n33. \nPhu Yen JSC will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.16 Phu Yen JSC will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will follow ADB requirements.17    \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n34. \nPhu Yen JSC and the project sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\n35. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),18 \n36. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \nViet Nam  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Phu  Yen  JSC.  ADB  will  enter  into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$176,700,000,  comprising  (i)  an  A  loan  of  up  to  $27,900,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources; and (ii) a B loan of up to $148,800,000 to Phu Yen TTP Joint Stock Company for the \n\n \n\n16  ADB. 2003.
