An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  This process-oriented Project will finance subproject investments \nthat will be selected and approved during implementation through \nparticipatory processes involving communities and implementing \nagencies. Implementation plans will evolve in response to local \nneeds  and  priorities  identified  through  active  community \nparticipation, while the pace of implementation will be linked to the \nrate of development of increased capacities at the local level. The \nProject focuses on the development of profitable and sustainable \nlivestock  enterprises  and  has  two  key  elements:  (i)  intensive \nlivestock production (22 districts); and (ii) processing, marketing, \nand commercialization of livestock subsector services (22 focus \ndistricts, and selected districts from the intensive production area). \nA livelihoods pilot program for five higher-altitude districts is to be \nformulated during the first 2 years of the Project, and implemented \nduring the last 4 years.  \n   \nRationale  The intent of national plans, the views of poverty and conflict-\naffected  communities,  the  recommendations  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Livestock Subsector Review, and the \nADB  country  program  strategy  all  recognize  the  need  for  a \nlivestock project with a poverty reduction focus: one that meets \nthe needs of the poor; effectively links production and marketing; \ncreates  jobs;  and  meets  urban  market  requirements  for  meat, \nmilk, and eggs currently supplied by imports. \n \nObjective  The  objective  is  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  rural \ncommunities in the project area. Its purpose will be to improve the \nlevels of food security, nutrition, incomes, and employment for \n164,000 families through increased productivity of the livestock \nsubsector in an environmentally sustainable and socially equitable \nmanner, while enhancing the capacity of the people to manage an \nongoing process of development themselves. \n \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $33.0  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $2.8 million, and local currency of \n$30.2  million  equivalent.  Component  investments  cover \ncommunity  development  and  capacity  building,  livestock \nproductivity improvement, livestock processing and marketing, a \nlivelihoods  pilot  program  for  higher  altitudes,  and  project \nmanagement services.

The loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  The  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS),  and  the  Rural \nMicrofinance Development Center (RMDC) \n   \nImplementation  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  oversee \nArrangements  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives will establish a project management unit (PMU) in \nKathmandu, headed by a project manager to supervise all project \nactivities.  Project  management  will  be  supported  and \ninstitutionalized  by  delegating  responsibilities  to  DLS  regional \ndirectors in each of the five development regions to implement \nspecific elements of the Project; and to coordinate, supervise, and \nmonitor  and  evaluate  project  activities.  A  working  level \nimplementation  coordination  committee  will  be  established  to \nguide  the  PMU  on  a  regular  basis.  A  group  of  established \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) with operational networks \nin the project area will implement the community development \ncomponent and RMDC will onlend microfinance to microfinance \nintermediaries  for  the  livestock  productivity  improvement,  and \nlivestock processing and marketing components.  \n   ", "  v\nProcurement  All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Major items such as equipment and vehicles will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Civil works to \nimprove infrastructure and facilities scattered over a large area will \nbe  in  many  small  contract  packages.  All  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  from  prequalified  local  contractors  through  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  team  of  consultants  will  support  project  implementation  and \nassist DLS in implementing the Project. The PMU will engage \nconsulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Quality-and  cost-based \nselection procedures will be used in recruiting the consultants. \nADB  approved  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  for \nGovernment recruitment of consultants. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  The main project benefits will be the incremental production and \nBeneficiaries  sale of milk, meat, eggs, and animals that will be consumed by the \nbeneficiaries  or  sold  in  local  markets.  Incremental  household \nincomes are expected to increase by 50% and levels of family \nnutrition to rise by 20%. Livestock services such as extension and \nanimal  vaccinations  by  village-level  livestock  development \nassistants  will  also  increase.  The  Project  will  provide \nenvironmental benefits: manure produced from cattle is used as \nfertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  about  49%  (0.6  million)  of  1.2  million \nhouseholds in the project area live below the poverty line. The \nProject  will  assist  69,000  households  (50%  of  the  poor \nhouseholds  in  targeted  production  pocket  areas)  to  improve \nlivestock  production,  concentrating  its  activities  on  landless \nhouseholds  and  those  headed  by  women  that  are  among  the \npoorest of the poor. In addition, 95,000 households will benefit \nfrom project marketing and processing interventions. Provision of \na readily accessible flow of financial and social resources through \nthe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  raising \nbeneficiaries\u2019  levels  of  empowerment,  particularly  in  accessing \nservices; (ii) increasing the number of organized farmer (female \nand  male)  groups  and  ward-level  associations;  (iii)  increasing \nhousehold  incomes  through  employment  generation;  (iv) \nimproving  the  nutritional  status  of  households  through \nconsumption  of  livestock  and  dairy  products;  (v)  increasing \nwomen\u2019s  employment  and  enhancing  participation  and  self-\ndetermination; and (vi) encouraging the growth of environment-\nfriendly economic enterprises. \n ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  The recent resumption of armed conflict and instability represent a \nproject risk. The eight new project districts have been among the \nworst affected and are active sites for conflict. However, because \nthe  insurgents  view  livestock  projects  as  highly  pro-poor  it  is \nexpected  that  the  Project  can  operate  in  the  districts  of  the \nongoing  Third  Livestock  Development  Project\u2014as  it  has  been \ndoing during the insurgency\u2014in addition to moving into new ones. \n  \nThe  Project\u2019s  participatory  planning  approach  will  give  the \nparticipating beneficiaries flexibility in selecting enterprises and \nensure that the individual makes the best possible choice. Past \nproject  experience  indicates  that  the  risk  of  adverse  producer \nprices is minimal, since most of the products are consumed or \nmarketed locally, with little outside competition at lower prices. \nAlso,  the  growing  consumption  levels  of  livestock  products  in \nNepal  indicate  that  household  consumption  and  local  market \ndemand will readily dispose of the Project\u2019s incremental output \nwithout a significant adverse impact on producer prices. The risk \nof  the  outbreak  of  animal  diseases  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nincreased  use  of  vaccines  supplied  by  community  livestock \nassistants.  The participatory processes used in the Project will \nminimize the risk that the transfer of technical staff and funds to \nthe district level as part of the devolution process in Nepal will \nexceed district level capacities and resources.  \n \n ", "   ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community Livestock Development Project (CLDP).1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.   Of Nepal's economically active population, 84% are engaged in subsistence-oriented \nagriculture. Farmers keep livestock to provide essential support for agriculture production (draft \npower and compost), nutrition for the family, and household income. Livestock farming is closely \ninterrelated  with  crop  production,  management  of  communal  lands,  and  remote  area \ntransportation. Animals also are assets that serve as a buffer against risk.  \n \n3.  In 2001 there were approximately 7 million cattle, 3.6 million buffalo, 0.9 million sheep, \n6.5 million goats, 0.9 million pigs, and 19.8 million poultry in Nepal. Nepal has one of the highest \nlivestock populations per capita and per unit of cultivable land of any country in Asia. Reliance is \non low-producing local breeds that are adapted to the environment. Improved livestock accounts \nfor only 8% of cattle, 21% of buffalo, 6% of sheep, 14% of goats, 41% of pigs, and 50% of \npoultry. These percentages are increasing as farmers in areas of good access respond to \nmarket signals by introducing new animals and using improved animal breeds. In the 12-year \nperiod to 1997/98, pig and poultry numbers increased significantly (72 and 79%, respectively). \nGoats (21%), buffalo (18%), and cattle (11%) increased more slowly. Sheep numbers are static, \nas are those of yak. Farmers with smaller landholdings of between 0.2 and 0.5 hectare (ha) \nkeep almost 25% of the livestock. People who have either no land or own less than 0.2 ha own \nabout 11% of the livestock. \n \n4.  The  contribution  of  the  livestock  sector  to  the  agricultural  gross  domestic  product  \n(AGDP) is currently estimated at 31% and is planned to increase to 45% by the latter part of the \nAgriculture Perspective Plan period (1995-2015). Dairy is the most important livestock activity, \naccounting for 62.7% of the total livestock sector contribution to AGDP, followed by meat \n(32.4%) and eggs (5.0%). Growth performance in the agriculture sector varies and the share of \nits subsectors has changed over time. During 1995-1996 to 1999-2000, the share of food \ngrains, cash crops, livestock, and fisheries increased, whereas that of other crops and forestry \ndeclined.  The  better  performing  subsectors were  fisheries  (9.7%),  cash  crops  (5.6%),  and \nlivestock (3.6%). In contrast, the growth rate for food grains was 2.3%, other crops 3.0%, and \nforestry 0.3%. Livestock (animals and products) exports are 0.2% of total exports and 1.1% of \ntotal imports, and 11.4% and 6.1% of agricultural sector exports and imports, respectively. \nIncome from livestock is high as a proportion of total income, particularly for poorer farmers over \n20% of whose income is from livestock, compared with around 9% for wealthier farmers.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  The livestock subsector recorded healthy growth during the 1990s and averaged over \n3% growth annually, accelerating from 1.6% during the first half of the decade to 3.6% in the \nsecond half. It is a fast-growing agriculture subsector and is considered important in poverty \nreduction. The Agriculture Perspective Plan targets the livestock subsector as an engine for \n                                                 \n1 Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom \nof Nepal for Preparing the Community Livestock Development Project. Manila. ", "2  \ngrowth in agriculture. The Ninth Plan (1997-2002) emphasized the prominent role expected of \nthe livestock subsector in national development, recognizing that it tends to redistribute urban \nwealth to the rural areas. The current Tenth Plan (2002-2007) seeks to bring about a substantial \nand sustainable reduction in poverty, and also gives special emphasis to the livestock subsector \nas a strategic means to reach poor communities and meet poverty reduction targets. \n \n6.  Development through livestock can reach over 80% of the rural population. The livestock \nsubsector is one of the key entry points for programs to reach the rural poor and, if correctly \noriented to small animals, its development favors disadvantaged groups, such as women and \npoorer farmers. Livestock needs to be brought more fully into the farming system as a revenue \nsource in its own right, rather than just to support crop enterprises. At present, extension and \nanimal  health  support  are  insufficient  due  to  poor  area  coverage,  and  use  of  inputs  is \nconstrained by a lack of awareness among communities and . Current returns to labor are low: \nfrom  about  $0.11  per  day  and  averaging  $0.53,  or  about  $40  per  year  for  poor  families. \nLivestock development is also environmentally neutral, contributing to land stability and soil \nimprovement from forage, reduced pressure on grazing lands from stall-feeding systems, and \nreduced dependence on forest resources through the use of biogas. Women undertake 70% of \nthe work and make many of the decisions associated with livestock keeping; therefore, key \nissues continue to be providing animal health and production services (including microfinance) \nto men and women farmers and improving the ability to use the services; and greater attention \nto the gender balance of farmer groups, umbrella organizations, and cooperatives.  \n  \n7.  The recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) Nepal Livestock Sector Review2 concluded \nthat,  while  the  livestock  subsector  is  very  complex,  with  many  crosscutting  issues  and \ninterrelationships with other sectors, it is a very important part of the agriculture sector and has \na key role to play in the country's development and in poverty reduction. While a great deal of \nprogress has been made over the last 30 years and innovative new approaches have been \ndeveloped,  new  approaches  are  still  needed.  Future  development  must  include  (i)  more \neffective social enhancement (strengthening of farmer organizations, and self-determination); (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening (changed attitudes, including sensitivity to issues of gender and social \nexclusion, improved capabilities, and levels of cooperation by government services-providers); \n(iii) increased commercialization involving market chain development, value addition, import \nsubstitution, and greater participation of the private sector; and (iv) improved coordination and \nsupport among government, the private sector, and aid agencies. The subsector analysis is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n8.  Between 1980 and 2003 ADB supported three livestock development projects with loans \ntotaling $37 million (Appendix 2).3 The projects covered 24 of the 75 districts of Nepal. Still \nmany  poorer  families  are  not  captured  by  this  development  assistance.  In  addition,  many \ndistricts in the west have had limited ADB or other external assistance. It is in these deprived \nareas that the recent insurgency has been most pronounced and where livestock development \nwill help meet some of the frustrated expectations of communities.  \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2001.

Lessons learned in the third and earlier ADB-assisted livestock development projects \nprovide  a  basis  for  further  development  and  improvement  in  the  livestock  subsector.  The \nsecond project was rated partially successful primarily because too much emphasis was placed \non introducing technological changes that beneficiaries were unable to adopt. While capability \nlevels and orientation in the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) have changed as a result \nof the support provided under the Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP), more needs to \nbe done to develop a facilitation- and output-oriented organization. Livestock action teams \n(LATs) at the district level in the TLDP have facilitated intersectoral cooperation, but more is \nneeded  at  the  village  and  central  levels.  The  Government  has  also  realized  that  greater \nemphasis on social mobilization and gender equality, and involvement of the private sector \n(community-based  organizations  [CBOs],  nongovernment  organizations  [NGOs],  and \nentrepreneurs) is required. With the creation of new positions frozen in the civil service, DLS \nmust develop new approaches to deliver services more effectively with existing staff resources.  \n \n10.  While the national incidence of poverty is 42%, incidence in the majority of the project \ndistricts is estimated at 60%. Poverty is highest among the disadvantaged castes (68%) and \nethnic minorities (58%). Poverty reduction through livestock involves reducing risks for the poor, \nimproving food security, improving levels of nutrition and incomes, improving livelihoods, and \nproviding an effective  asset buffer against adversity. Small animals purchased locally with \nmicrofinance, supported by improved animal health services, improved levels of feeding, and \nincreased  knowledge  of  animal  husbandry  methods  and  marketing  provide  poor  farm \nhouseholds with the means to reduce poverty. Livestock production, processing, and marketing \nare a base for entrepreneurial activity and stimulate job creation. Milk, for example, has an \nemployment multiplier effect of around 8:1. \n \n11.  Unequal development, economic disparity, crisis in governance, high underemployment, \nrural poverty, social exclusion, and gender discrimination have produced a fertile ground for the \nrecent conflict to take root in rural communities, particularly in the Mid-Western Region. There \nhas been significant migration to towns in search of protection and social services. Other \nfamilies  have  been  completely  displaced.  For  those  who  stayed,  the  conflict  has  affected \nhousehold work and productivity, increased household expenses, and led to domestic stress. \nAffected communities have indicated that they should be mobilized and unified in their efforts to \nparticipate in effective income generation and employment programs, and be trained to improve \ntheir capabilities and capacities. \n \n12.  Nepal is a rapidly urbanizing country where 50% of the population (30 million) will live in \nurban areas by 2035 (20% or 4 million currently live in urban areas). The rural population will \ncome under increasing pressure to supply urban consumers with their meat, milk, and egg \nrequirements. Nepal imports approximately half its current requirements for meat and milk, and \nimport substitution is a national objective. The marketing of live animals and meat is undertaken \nentirely by the private sector and is reasonably efficient, although quality standards require \nimprovement. Marketed milk is either locally produced milk or processed milk reconstituted from \nimported milk powder. The formal milk marketing system shows marked seasonal differences in \nproduction, and oversupply occurs in some months. Where milk collection is not possible, \nseasonal surpluses are converted to butter. \n \n13.  DLS  has  had  the  experience  of  implementing  three  major  ADB  loans  for  livestock \ndevelopment, and participated in several other smaller projects over the last 20 years (Appendix \n2).  There  is  a  history  of  successful  experiences  and  innovation  on  which  to  base  further \ndevelopment activity (paras. 7\u20139). DLS is considered one of the more innovative government \ndepartments in Nepal and is more attuned to development priorities. It has pioneered several ", "4  \ninnovations such as public-private partnerships, cross-sectoral cooperation, and small-scale \nentrepreneur development. DLS has the technical competence to implement another project, \nbut  the  changes  in  managerial  ability,  role  orientation,  cross-sectoral  linkages,  extension \ncapability, and competence started under the TLDP need to be continued and reinforced. DLS \nconstraints also include a staff-to-farming household ratio of 1:2,000, insufficient training for \ntechnical  staff,  lack  of  specialization,  mobility  problems,  weak  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncapacity, and an input-driven orientation as opposed to a demand- and output-driven outlook \nthat public-private partnerships can address.  \n \n14.  Several policy issues identified in the ADB Nepal Livestock Subsector Review require \nattention. They include (i) giving equal opportunities to livestock industries, which are treated \ndifferently  from  agriculture  industries  in  the  value-added  tax,  tax  exemption,  discounted \nelectricity charges, bank interest rates, and import duties; (ii) enforcing existing legislation on \nproduct quality control, hygiene, and environmental management; and (iii) privatizing facilities \nand services that the private sector can undertake. Privatization of the Pokhara Milk Supply \nScheme and the future role of the Dairy Development Corporation in the subsector are issues \nthat need to be resolved. The Government has prepared a time-bound action plan to address \nthese policy issues. \n \n15.  The intent of national plans, the views of poverty and conflict-affected communities, the \nrecommendations of the subsector review, and the ADB country program strategy all recognize \nthe need for a livestock project with a poverty reduction focus, one that meets the needs of the \npoor, particularly poor women; effectively links production and marketing; creates jobs; and \nmeets urban market requirements for meat, milk, and eggs currently supported by imports. The \nproject design is consistent with these objectives. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n16.  The Project aims to reduce poverty among poor rural men and women through gender \nand  socially  inclusive  development.  Its  purpose  will  be  to  improve  levels  of  food  security, \nnutrition, incomes, and employment from livestock production and small-scale livestock related \nenterprises in 48 districts (all 5 development regions) of Nepal (map, page vii). The Project will \nbenefit  164,000  families  through  increased  productivity  of  the  livestock  subsector  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable and socially equitable manner, while enhancing the capacity of men \nand women to manage the development process. The project framework is in Appendix 3. The \nproject concept and area are described in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n17.  The  project  comprises  five  components:  (i)  community  development  and  capacity \nbuilding, (ii) livestock productivity improvement, (iii) livestock processing and marketing, (iv) a \nlivelihoods pilot program for higher altitudes, and (v) project management services. \n \n1.  Community Development and Capacity Building \n18.  The objective of this component is to build the capacity of all stakeholders to a level \nwhere they contribute significantly to the Project's goal and purpose. Experience in the TLDP \nhas been that for communities to benefit from livestock productivity improvement programs, they \nmust  be  made  more  aware  of  their  rights  and  responsibilities,  and  risks,  and  have  their \ncompetency levels raised before development activities begin. The project design recognizes ", "  5\nthat time must be allowed and the effort increased for community awareness building. The most \ntime  and  effort  are  required  in  districts  worst  affected  by  poverty  and  the  recent  civil \ndisturbances. The component targets not less than 35% women participants. \n \na.  Community Development \n \n19.  DLS will work in partnership with local NGOs, and district and village development \ncommittees (DDCs and VDCs) in 22 districts to undertake poverty and social mapping to identify \nand  target  poorer  and  disadvantaged  communities,  and  intensive  livestock  development \npockets (areas) according to established criteria. An NGO or consultant group will undertake \nbaseline studies involving quantitative and qualitative assessment in each district. The data will \nprovide a clearer understanding of the socioeconomic characteristics of the beneficiaries and a \nbenchmark against which project progress may be measured.  \n \n20.  Targeted communities in approximately 690 selected intensive livestock development \npockets will be informed of project opportunities, their responsibilities and risks associated with \nparticipation, and the rights of communities through awareness programs run by NGO partners. \nThe NGOs, supported by DLS, will assess the training needs of communities (male and female), \nand training programs will be village based, farmer-to-farmer, and oriented toward enterprise \neducation  (embracing  technology,  legal  literacy,  and  basic  agribusiness).  Training  will \nstrengthen farmer organizations and farmer capabilities. It will focus on leadership, records and \nbookkeeping, financial savings, meeting procedures, animal health and production technology, \nforage development, and local-level marketing. \n \n21.  The  capacity  of  district-level  organizations\u2014CBOs  and  NGOs\u2014to  participate  in  the \nProject will also be assessed in the baseline study. Potential partners of at least one locally \nbased NGO per district and two microfinance intermediaries (MFIs) will be identified, along with \ntheir capacity-building requirements, using selection criteria established in the TLDP. Local \norganizations will be strengthened in the areas of social mobilization (including their ability to \nincrease  the  participation  of  women  and  the  poor),  livestock  enterprise  activity,  and \nmicrofinance  to  (i)  improve  their  performance  as  project  partners,  (ii)  encourage  balanced \ngrowth in the organization, and (iii) reinforce their prospects of sustainability. \n \n22.  Concurrently,  awareness  of  the  Project\u2019s  aims  and  activities,  and  new  roles  and \nresponsibilities will be raised among DLS staff and key staff in the project DDCs. Project \norientation programs will be held, followed by a three-module package of training that will \ninclude (i) social mobilization; (ii) improving animal production, and agribusiness; and (iii) basic \nprinciples of animal and product processing, and marketing.  \n \n23.  Approximately 3,450 farmer groups, comprising at least 35% women in mixed groups, \nwith 20 households per group will be formed after social mobilization activities. Communities will \nselect an enterprise from a menu of 15 livestock enterprises, and groups will be formed around \nshared interests, such as poultry and goat groups. Group members will agree on an objective, \nprepare an action plan, and commit to a savings program. Elected group leaders will receive \ntraining in leadership, monitoring, evaluation, and bookkeeping to improve the efficiency and \ntransparency of group activities. All group members will receive enterprise education training. \nAn umbrella committee will coordinate the activity of 5-10 groups to address any production-\nrelated or input and output supply problems, consider the growth of small economic units \n(groups) into larger legally recognized economic units (cooperative societies), address broader \ncommunity needs, and liaise with lower levels of administration such as VDCs and DDCs. \n ", "6  \n24.  Communities will be encouraged to identify a member of their community for training as \na community livestock assistant (CLA). Approximately one CLA per two production pockets is \nenvisaged (345 CLAs), and at least 35% of the CLAs will be women. The CLAs are expected to \nbecome self-supporting, obtaining income from the sale of services to the community, or to the \ncommunity through the VDC. CLAs will also have the opportunity to undertake para-veterinary \ntraining to improve their ability to support themselves.  \n \nb.   Development of CBO and NGO Capacity \n \n25.  NGOs selected at district level will be approved by the project management unit (PMU) \naccording to criteria used in the TLDP, and will be allocated operational areas. They will deliver \nsocial mobilization and training services to the participating beneficiaries over 3-4 years. Female \nrepresentation in the NGO and orientation of its activities toward women will be part of the NGO \nselection  criteria.  Capable  MFIs  will  distribute  microfinance  to  beneficiaries.  The  Rural \nMicrofinance  Development  Center  (RMDC)  or  microfinance  trainers  will  provide  capacity \nbuilding  training  to  approximately  100  MFIs,  focusing  on  existing  institutions.  In  districts \ncurrently  without  MFIs,  NGOs  or  farmer  cooperatives  will  be  assisted  to  become  MFIs. \nParticipating NGOs will be trained to improve their social mobilization and group strengthening \ncapability. \n \nc.  Development of DLS Capacity \n \n26.  In addition to training to improve the extension capabilities of DLS district-level staff, 35 \nmore  senior  DLS  officers  and  40  district  officers  will  be  trained  locally  in  leadership, \nmanagement, and planning to strengthen the project implementation and managerial capacity of \nthe  department.  To  strengthen  DLS\u2019s  capabilities  in  the  participatory  systems  learning \napproach, provision is made for DLS staff training. Short-term, awareness building immersion \ntraining will be provided for another 250 DLS staff, DDC, and private sector partners. All DLS \nstaff  will  receive  gender  and  organizational  change  training  to  ensure  that  gender  is  fully \nintegrated into DLS structures and practice. The project manager will be the gender focal point \nat  the  central  level.  Junior  technicians  and  their  assistants  will  be  trained  in  production, \nprocessing and marketing to develop specialist support at the district level. DLS staff will receive \ntraining  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  from  the  Project's  technical  assistance  team.  Two \nmembers  of  the  recently  formed  Directorate  of  Livestock  Marketing  Promotion  will  receive \ntraining in marketing, market development, market information systems, and quality assurance \nand control systems. Department of Food Technology and Quality Control and DLS officers will \nalso be trained in meat inspection, milk and meat quality, and quality control and assurance \nsystems. Quality control laboratory facilities will also be improved. \n \nd.   District Development Committee Strengthening \n \n27.  DDC staff in at least 22 intensive livestock districts will receive project orientation to \nstrengthen their capacity to implement livestock development programs. Key staff will be trained \nin management, and monitoring and evaluation. Members of the district and village LATs will \nreceive training in gender awareness, microfinance, and monitoring and evaluation. Women \nstaff members will have priority for this training.  \n \ne.  Development of Private Sector Capacity \n \n28.  The Project will assist DLS to work with representative private sector organizations such \nas the Nepal Dairies Association, Nepal Butchers Services Committee, and poultry and feed ", "  7\nmillers  associations  to  develop  their  capabilities  to  implement  member  awareness,  quality \nassurance, and member training programs. The objective is to begin to shift responsibility to the \nprivate sector for a number of the needs of private sector entrepreneurs.  \n \n2.  Livestock Productivity Improvement \n29.  Fifteen livestock improvement models have been identified as suitable for small and \nresource-poor  farmers.  Thus,  the  69,000  men  and  women  farmers  participating  in  the  22 \nintensive  production  districts  will  have  a  degree  of  choice  in  selecting  project  activities. \nEmphasis will be on smaller investments such as forages, goats, calf rearing, pigs, and poultry \nto enable a higher proportion of poorer families (including women and disadvantaged groups) to \nparticipate. Financial savings by beneficiaries will be promoted. \n \n30.  Training is proposed for feed millers, poultry farmers, and feed ingredient suppliers to \nimprove the standard of feed formulation. Feed standards will be reviewed, and the Department \nof Food Technology and Quality Control and DLS will undertake quality control with 520 district-\nlevel  staff  being  trained  in  this  area.  Approximately  20  entrepreneurs  will  be  assisted  to \nestablish  small-scale  feed  mill  operations  in  the  intensive  livestock  production  areas,  with \nemphasis on using forage legumes to replace imported protein ingredients. Better quality feeds \nwill benefit all producers, including the poor. Loans will also be provided for biogas digesters, in \ncooperation with the Biogas Support Program.  \n \n31.  Forage-led development will involve importing new genetic stock, demonstrating species \nand their management to farmers, and establishing a viable forage seed industry. DLS district \nstaff  will  extend  forage  technologies  and  management  to  farmers  using  the  successful \nstrategies developed under the TLDP. DLS staff will be trained in seed production systems and \ntechnologies suitable for adoption in Nepal.  \n \n32.  RMDC and its network of MFIs will provide microfinance credit. A total of 100 MFIs are \nlikely partners. RMDC or a specialized training institution will train 60 less experienced MFIs to \nprovide microfinance services in six project districts currently without such services. Borrowers \nare  more  likely  to  be  women;  therefore  training  will  emphasize  gender  issues  related  to \nmicrofinance. An equity contribution of 10% in the form of labor is expected from small farmers \nborrowing to establish their selected enterprise. Improvement in microfinance performance will \nbe facilitated through a program of training for MFIs, farmer leaders, and DLS district staff.  \n \n3.  Livestock Processing and Marketing  \n33.  This component aims to develop small-scale and localized processing and marketing of \nlivestock products for the benefit of producers. The component will create employment and \nimprove product quality. Microcredit for small enterprises will be made available to commercial \nbanks through RMDC. Approximately 1,050 small enterprises will be created, with investments \nranging from live animal markets to milk chilling centers, milk processing facilities, slaughter \nslabs, meat shops, and para-veterinary practices. The enterprises are estimated to provide at \nleast 5,100 person-years of permanent employment. The project initiatives will be demand-led \nand private-sector based. Where possible, local bodies (municipalities and DDCs) and private \nsector entrepreneurs will be encouraged to develop integrated market facilities to be known as \nthe  livestock  commercial  center  approach.  Awareness-raising  activities,  market  supply  and \ndemand appraisals, market linkage analyses, and stakeholder participatory planning exercises \nwill precede market development activities. A range of training will be available to improve the ", "8  \nskills of those already involved in processing and marketing, and to bring new entrepreneurs \ninto the business. \n \n34.  In  at  least  22  livestock  commercial  centers,    existing  live  animal  markets  will  be \nimproved and new markets developed. Approximately 2,400 farmer leaders, of which at least \n35% will be women\u2014in accordance with the Government\u2019s policy of promoting a minimum of \n35% women\u2019s participation in all development activities\u2014will be made aware of how they may \nextend their influence along the market chain to the markets, and 1,680 farmers and traders will \nreceive training in market management. The Project will provide assistance to improve the \nquality and hygiene standards of slaughter, meat handling, and meat selling.  \n \n35.  The Project will provide credit for 370 new dairy enterprises comprising chilling centers, \nsmall-scale and cottage dairies, and cold chain retail outlets. The strategy will be to encourage \nentrepreneurial activity in and around district towns and to provide consumers with an increased \nsupply of improved products. A significant campaign to raise farmer awareness of milk hygiene \nwill be undertaken along with new dairy entrepreneur training, milk processor training, milk plant \nmaintenance, and milk product quality management. As in the TLDP, the objective will be to \nstimulate local processing and marketing microenterprises, generate employment, and increase \nthe supply of products to meet the demand of consumers in rural towns.  \n \n36.  It has become clear from the TLDP that processing and marketing initiatives may be \nlimited by low levels of consumer responsiveness and that consumer awareness and education \nprograms must run parallel with market development activities. The Project will support a series \nof mass media programs directed at urban consumers to make consumers more aware of \nhygiene  and  quality  issues,  and  the  reasons  behind  market  improvement  initiatives.  The \noutcome, as has been indicated by TLDP experience, is appreciation by consumers of quality \nassurance systems, and increased demand for improved quality products. \n \n37.  As the demand for animal health and production services in commercialized farming \nareas is outstripping the ability of DLS to provide services, farmers show a strong demand for \nthe services of private para-veterinary personnel. Based on TLDP\u2019s successful experience and \nneeds, the Project will support the establishment of 250 para-veterinarians. DLS will be assisted \nto link with and provide training to strengthen private sector organizations. Technical assistance \nwill be provided to the new Directorate of Livestock Marketing Promotion to develop policies and \naction plans, and to build working linkages with the private sector.  \n \n4.  Livelihoods Pilot Program for Higher Altitudes \n38.  A  limited  knowledge  of  successful  strategies to  improve  livestock production in  the \ndifficult higher altitude environment prevents DLS from delivering programs suitable for the high \nhills. The Project will support (i) the cost of data assembly on experience from similar agro- \necological regions, (ii) surveys and investigations into the changing nature of transhumant \nlivestock keeping in the pilot program area, (iii) participatory rural appraisal studies into the \ndevelopment needs of people in the pilot area, and (iv) participatory preparation of a multisector \nplan to be implemented in the final 4 years of the Project. The proposed pilot area comprises \nfive districts that are on traditional north/south transhumance routes.  \n \n5.  Project Management Services \n39.  The  Project  will  support  DLS  with  the  required  financial  and  technical  assistance \nresources necessary to ensure the effective implementation, management, and coordination of ", "  9\nproject activities. A PMU will be established in Kathmandu and staffed by DLS. It will be \nsupported by project implementation technical assistance in two locations, Kathmandu (project \nmanagement,  and  processing  and  marketing  support  for  the  processing  districts),  and \nNepalgunj  (for  livestock  productivity  improvement  districts,  and  training  in  implementation \nactivities).  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n40.  More emphasis than in the TLDP will be placed on social and community development \nactivities to prepare poorer communities for livestock improvement activities. Experience in \nNepal shows that a livelihood approach and provision of adequate time (3-12 months) for social \nadjustment are necessary for livestock development interventions to be successful. Ensuring \nthe sustainability and replicability of livestock enterprises to other areas will be emphasized.  \n \n41.  Four districts previously under the TLDP have been selected to act as leader and pilot \ndistricts. They are leader districts in the sense that their achievements in the area of farmer \nmobilization, NGO partnerships, interaction with the private sector, and forage development \nactivities can serve as a model and a learning experience for replication in new project districts. \nThe Government\u2019s decentralization policy also requires that new arrangements be introduced \nfor funding at the district level, and interaction between the DDCs and DLS district staff. The \ndistricts will be used as pilot districts where the new relationships and modalities for replication \nelsewhere can be developed, tested, and demonstrated. \n \n42.  The pocket package and group approach has been modified from the TLDP approach. \nIn association with the district livestock services officer, LATs, and VDCs and DDCs will identify \npocket areas on the basis of poverty-affected communities in wards. Thus, the pockets will be \narea based, rather than commodity based. Linkages will be developed between farmers in \ngroups and the lower levels of administration in wards and villages. Ward livestock committees \nwill coordinate the activities of groups, assist with organizing inputs and services such as \ninsurance,  and  represent  the  interests  of  group  members  with  village  and  district \nadministrations.  \n \n43.  Communities, in the form of farmer groups and their associations, will have three foci. \nThe primary focus will be on making their enterprise activity financially successful and capable \nof growth. The second will be on addressing community concerns and needs such as literacy, \nhealth, or other social needs. The third will be on the concept of helping others less fortunate in \nthe community by using their own experience to assist other groups to establish and function. \nFor  the  three  foci  to  work  well,  women  need  to  be  strongly  represented,  not  only  in  a \nparticipatory sense, but also in decision-making roles. The target is involvement of at least 35% \nwomen.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n44.  The estimated project cost is $33.0 million equivalent, inclusive of physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $2.8 million, or about 8% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $30.2 million equivalent, or about 92% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency costs include an estimated $4.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by \nDLS and investors. The project cost estimates summarized in Table 1 should be regarded as \nindicative only.

Financing Plan \n \n45.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $20  million  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance 61% of the project cost. The loan will fund $2.8 million (100% of the \ntotal foreign exchange cost), and $17.2 million equivalent of the local currency cost (67% of the \ntotal  local  currency  cost).  The  Government  has  been  requested  to  provide  $5.0  million \nequivalent, or 15% of the project cost. RMDC and MFIs will contribute $6.5 million toward the \ncost of livestock enterprise development, or 20% of the project cost. The beneficiary households \nthat receive microfinance packages and entrepreneurs that receive agro enterprise packages \nwill contribute 1.5 million or 4% of the project cost through their labor and cash inputs in \nestablishing the livestock and small business enterprises. Local cost financing is justified given \nthe poverty-oriented nature of the Project, and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n46.  The Borrower will be the Government of Nepal. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% during \nthe grace period and an interest charge of 1.5% per annum during the amortization period. The \nGovernment will relend to RMDC the portion of the ADB loan required for investing in livestock \nenterprises, in accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreement. The subsidiary \nloan  agreement  will  contain  procedures,  terms  and  conditions,  and  implementation \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. RMDC will in turn onlend to participating MFIs under subloan \nagreements,  and  the  MFIs  will  use  these  funds  to  provide  microfinance  to  farmers  and \nentrepreneurs. The subloan agreements will specify procedures, terms and conditions, and ", " 11\nimplementation arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The Government will provide the funds to the \nPMU for the livestock development portions of the Project.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n47.  DLS will be the Executing Agency (EA) responsible for overall project management and \nimplementation of all noncredit activities. Having managed three previous projects for ADB, DLS \nhas  shown  that  it  has  the  necessary  organizational  structure  and  staff  skills  to  manage \nsuccessfully a large and diverse project. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) \nwill appoint a project manager in its head office. The Project will fund a small PMU that will be \nlocated in Kathmandu, and which will be staffed by a team of seconded staff comprising (i) a \nmanagerially competent project manager, (ii) deputy project manager, (iii) two planning officers \n(field  programs,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation),  (iv)  two  junior  technical  officers,  (v)  an \naccounts officer, and (vi) adequate support staff.  \n \n48.  The PMU will act as a facilitating unit. It will (i) prepare annual work plans and the \nrelevant project reports in consultation with other service providers; (ii) supervise all project \nactivities and the performance of the implementing agencies and service providers; and (iii) \nmonitor and evaluate project activities, project outputs, and expected impacts. The PMU will \nalso ensure that several crosscutting issues are firmly embedded in project activities: (i) the \ninclusive and participatory systems learning approach to be used in the Project, (ii) gender \nawareness and gender equity, (iii) environment concerns and mitigation measures, and (iv) \ngood governance. To deliver project services effectively to 48 districts, management of the \nProject will be supported and institutionalized by delegating  to the DLS regional director in each \nof the five development regions the responsibility to coordinate, supervise, implement selected \nactivities, and monitor and evaluate project activities.  \n \n49.  As  EA,  RMDC  will  distribute  project  microfinance  services  and  credit  funds  to \nparticipating MFIs and commercial banks on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. RMDC is \na capable institution, which is satisfactorily implementing the ADB-financed Rural Microfinance ", "12  \nProject.4  NGOs  will  be  recruited  to  form  farmer  groups  and  provide  preparatory  social \nmobilization  before  providing  microfinance  to  group  members.  Through  the  Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of Nepal and commercial banks, RMDC will provide the credit for livestock \nprocessing and marketing. At the midterm review, these arrangements will be reviewed.  \n \n50.  A project steering committee (PSC) has been established to oversee the implementation \nof the Project. It will meet as necessary, but not less than twice a year, to review progress and \nresolve policy issues. The secretary of MOAC will chair the committee, which will include \nrelevant joint secretaries from MOAC; ministerial representatives from the Ministry of Finance; \nMinistry of Forests and Soil Conservation; Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare; \nMinistry of Local Development; the National Planning Commission; and RMDC, with the director \ngeneral of DLS as member secretary. \n \n51.  An implementation coordination committee (ICC) will be established to guide the PMU \non a more regular basis. Chaired by the director general of DLS; the committee will comprise \nheads of DLS\u2019 directorates for animal health, marketing, training and extension, and animal \nproduction;  MOAC\u2019s  Department  of  Food  Technology  and  Quality  Control;  as  well  as \nrepresentatives  of  the  Department  of  Women  Development;  milk,  meat,  and  poultry-based \norganizations;5 RMDC; the Nepal Rastra Bank, and regional project managers. Representatives \nof other stakeholder organizations6 will be co-opted as necessary. The ICC will meet every 2 \nmonths. Its responsibility will be to address and resolve implementation issues, to advise on \ntechnical matters, and to advise the PSC on policy matters.  \n \n2.  Component Implementation \n \n52.  The PMU will implement the Project, in cooperation with the various DLS directorates \nand RMDC. It will also be responsible for organizing training at the central level, such as the \nproposed management training for DLS officers. The regional project managers will implement \ntraining and technical backstopping being made available through regional training centers, and \ncoordinate activities between districts in their regions. \n \n53.  District livestock offices, and NGOs will undertake district activities involving community \nawareness  building,  social  mobilization,  gender  awareness,  group  formation,  livestock \nproductivity improvement, farmer training, community-based livestock development assistance, \nand monitoring and evaluation. District implementation arrangements will be further defined \nduring project implementation to meet the Government's intention to decentralize fiscal and \nadministrative responsibility to DDCs. LATs proved an effective mechanism under the TLDP for \ncoordinating  and  aligning  line  agency  programs  at  village  level,  and  establishing  linkages \nbetween line agencies and DDCs. This mechanism will be continued, extended to VDC level, \nand be institutionalized within the DDC organizational structure. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Initial \nactivities will include recruiting consultants for the PMU; establishing a project performance \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n5 Such as Nepal Dairy Association and Newa Khadki Sewa Samiti meat industry association. \n6 For example, the Federation of Forest User Groups of Nepal; and other projects such as the Rural-Urban \nPartnership Program, the Microenterprise Development Project, and the Biogas Support Program. ", " 13\nmonitoring  system  in  DLS;  carrying  out  district  and  market  area  benchmark  surveys, \nparticipatory rapid appraisals and community discussions; selecting local NGOs; and procuring \nessential equipment and vehicles. Enterprise development and credit disbursements in new \nproject areas will be delivered starting in the third quarter of 2004, while in previous TLDP \nareas, these activities will continue without interruption. A summary project implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Lending Terms and Conditions \n \n55.  The  cost  of  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation  activities  is  high.  The \nGovernment has agreed to onlend to RMDC, and for RMDC to onlend to MFIs at a level that will \nallow MFIs to obtain an adequate interest spread to cover all costs, cover for bad and doubtful \ndebts, and an adequate savings margin. The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk for \nthe ADB loan. It is proposed that the Government relend $5.2 million equivalent to RMDC at a \nservice charge of 2% per year for 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. RMDC will \nonlend to MFIs with a margin of 3.5%, at an interest rate of not more than 5.5%. RMDC\u2019s \nlending spread will be used to cover the cost of bad debts; evaluating and selecting MFIs; and \nmonitoring their performance, credit risks, and profit. Project funds are separately available to \nsupport training in financial management for the staff of 60 MFIs. The cost of funds for RMDC \nwill be reviewed periodically as needed and at the midterm review. Funds onlent to MFIs for the \npurpose of providing loans to microfinance clients will be for an initial term of 18 months with \nquarterly repayments of interest and semi-annual repayments of principal. Subject to acceptable \nMFI repayment performance, the term of subsequent loans may be extended to 3 years and, \neventually 5 years. The participating banks and MFIs will onlend to smallholders for poultry, \nbuffalo fattening, and goat-rearing (and other small animals); and to entrepreneurs investing in \nprocessing enterprises at prevailing market rates, using the interest rate margin to cover credit \ndelivery and management costs, other operating costs, and an allowance for bad debts and \nprofit. Livestock loans will be supported by farmer organization insurance schemes, which have \nbeen successfully operated under the TLDP.  \n \n5.  Procurement \n \n56.  Goods, related services, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since any civil works will be small and widely dispersed, \nforeign contractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding. Consequently, all the civil works \ncontracts will be procured through local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nPrequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. A \ncontracted private sector engineer under the guidance of the PMU will advise on the award of \ncontracts  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  livestock  processing,  and  market  improvements. \nSupply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more  are  not \nexpected,  but  if  a  contract  becomes  necessary,  it  will  be  awarded  through  international \ncompetitive bidding, and those costing less than the equivalent of $500,000 (other than minor \nitems) will be awarded through international shopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used \nfor  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than  $100,000.  The  PMU  will  procure  the \nequipment and vehicles. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 7. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n57.  The Project will require 531 person-months of consulting services in two packages (A and \nB) for training, guidance of process-related activities, technical support, and privatization issues ", "14  \nassociated  with  the  provision  of  farmer  services,  inputs  marketing,  and  agroprocessing. \nInternational (67 person-months) and domestic (464 person-months) consultants will be fielded \nto support the identified beneficiaries and achieve the desired technology transfer and change in \napproach. The EA will select the PMU implementation support consultants for packages A and \nB  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  EA  will  engage  other  required  consulting  services  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures will be used in recruiting the consultants. The Government will undertake advance \naction  for  recruiting  implementation  consultants  to  facilitate  the  project  start-up.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n58.  The civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in value. To ensure \neffective project implementation and timely disbursement, the Government will establish two \nimprest accounts in the name of the Project at NRB immediately after the effectiveness of the \nloan agreement. Payments for eligible items will be made to DLS through one account, and to \nRMDC  for  microfinance  and  credit  funds  through  the  other  account.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small \ncontracts. The imprest accounts and the SOE procedure will be established, maintained, and \naudited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling of the imprest \naccounts will not exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 months, or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The SOE procedure is applicable for reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances under the imprest account for any individual \npayment below $50,000 equivalent. All project expenditures incurred by the Project will be \nsubmitted by the PMU through DLS and by RMDC to ADB for reimbursement. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n59.  DLS will submit to ADB trimester and annual progress reports on project implementation. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  the  reports,  particularly  addressing  progress  in  meeting  the  project \ntargets. The reports will include information on the physical progress of the project and the \nstatus of the project components. Within 3 months of substantial physical completion of the \nProject, DLS will submit to ADB a project completion report that will cover the details of project \nimplementation,  cost,  project  performance  management  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n60.  DLS will maintain separate project accounts and records to facilitate identification of \nincome  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  be  assigned  sufficient  and \nqualified accounting staff, including an accountant. An auditor acceptable to ADB will annually \naudit all the accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project. The \nAuditor General\u2019s Office of Nepal is acceptable for this purpose. The annual audit will include \naudit of the imprest account and SOE procedure. The annual audit report will include a separate \naudit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within \n9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n \n ", " 15\n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n61.  To ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, the PMU will use a participatory and gender-sensitive \nproject performance monitoring program modeled on ADB\u2019s monitoring system, which improves \non the one used in the TLDP. The Project will strengthen DLS\u2019s management information \nsystem and adapt it to the project\u2019s information requirements. Periodic monitoring activities will \nassess  whether  the  project  inputs  and  activities  have  delivered  the  expected  outputs  and \nbenefits to the intended beneficiaries. The monitoring system will also be used to detect at an \nearly stage any discrepancy between the project plan and its execution.  \n \n62.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  initial  district-level  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic \nsurveys  are  conducted,  and  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring \nperformance and for preparing gender-disaggregated benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review \nand concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PMU will submit annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will be \nconducted to review the progress of the Project before the ADB midterm review. The EA will \ncomplete an impact evaluation study before the PMU prepares the project completion report. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n63.  ADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will cover review of the \nperformance of DLS and the PMU, RMDC and MFIs, participating NGOs, and any other project \nimplementing agencies; implementation of the loan covenants and the gender action plan; \nphysical  progress  of  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  midterm \nreview will allow the Government and ADB to monitor the Project and to adjust the project \ndesign and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n   \nA.  Economic Impacts \n \n64.  The main project benefits will be the incremental production and sale of milk, milk \nproducts, meat, eggs, forage, seeds, and animals that will be consumed by the beneficiaries or \nsold in local markets. Household incomes are expected to increase by 50% from the current \naverage of $40 per year, and levels of family nutrition to improve by 20%.  \n \n65.  Intermediate outputs will be increased forage and feed supplies that improve animal \nhealth and productivity, improved care of existing livestock, and reduced risks associated with \nanimal keeping. Increased meat and milk supplies will be available to consumers; support \nservices to farmers will improve with the activities of CLAs and better-trained DLS field staff; and \nlocal NGOs and MFIs will be strengthened. The livestock processing and marketing component \nwill create permanent employment opportunities of about 5,100 person-years, and improve \naccess to markets and farmers\u2019 market awareness for about 95,000 households. The Project \nwill provide environmental benefits in the form of dung for use as crop fertilizer and domestic \nfuel, and in biogas production. The Project will also provide consumer benefits in the form of \nmilk, meat, and milk and meat products of improved hygiene and quality. \n \n66.  A process driven by farmer demand will determine the outputs; so it is difficult to predict \nthe actual mix of enterprise investment and scale of the outputs. Therefore, a full benefit cost ", "16  \nanalysis for the overall project was considered impractical. Furthermore, it is not possible to \nquantify the longer-term benefits of the human capital development activities in the community \nand  capacity  development  components.  Livestock  services,  especially  those  provided  to \ncommunities  by  CLAs,  and  the  private  sector,  will  be  improved.  The  summary  project \njustification and financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 9. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n67.  Poor farm families will be offered a choice of one of several livestock enterprises that \nmatch their needs, resources, and circumstances. Group strategies will result in high adoption \nrates of individual enterprises by farmers. The Project will reach 69,000 poorer farming families, \nwhile processing activities will be offered to 95,000 families. There are approximately 1.1 million \nfarming households in the project area, of which 49% are below the poverty line. The Project will \nreach about 50% of poverty-affected communities in production pockets in the project area. The \nProject  will  particularly  target  landless  households  headed  by  women,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups such as ex-bonded laborers and low caste families. Low-cost enterprises have been \nspecifically developed to facilitate access of the target groups to income-generating activities.  \n \n68.  Expected impacts of livestock enterprises on poverty have been examined. Agricultural \nproduction benefits generally accrue to the owners of the land, but there are additional expected \nincrements to household income through more efficient labor use with the Project. Assuming the \ndegree of unemployment and underemployment typical of the districts of west Nepal, in financial \nterms  this  improved  return  to  labor  (measured  as  returns  per  day)  will  add  50%  to  poor \nhouseholds\u2019 income and raise them above the poverty line.  \n \n69.  Access to a regular and usable flow of financial and social resources provided by the \nProject will contribute to poverty reduction by (i) raising beneficiaries\u2019 levels of empowerment, \nparticularly with regard to accessing services; (ii) increasing the number of organized farmer \n(female  and  male)  groups  and  ward-level  associations;  (iii)  increasing  household  incomes \nthrough employment generation; (iv) improving the nutritional status of households through \nconsumption of livestock and dairy products; (v) increasing women\u2019s employment, participation, \nand  self-determination;  and  (vi)  encouraging  the  growth  of  environment-friendly  economic \nenterprises. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n \n70.  In 690 poverty-affected pocket areas the Project will improve levels of awareness of \ncommunities,  and  promote  improved  and  easy  access  to  skill  development  and  capacity- \nbuilding resources and services. About 3,450 farmer organizations will be strengthened through \nintensive training of leaders and members. Farmer groups will be affiliated at ward level so that \ncommunity concerns can be more directly transmitted to the lowest levels of administration at \nVDC and DDC levels. This change is expected to lead to greater empowerment of the poor to \ndemand and gain access to services and resources they would otherwise not obtain and will be \na long-term benefit of the Project. Furthermore, NGOs and MFIs will be increased (24 additional \nMFIs will be established) and strengthened to better provide ongoing service to communities. \n \n71.  Successful livestock enterprises initiated by the Project and the social benefits arising \nfrom  successful  community  mobilization  will  lead  to  employment  generation  for  the  poor, \nespecially through the development of technical and managerial skills among women project \nparticipants. Social benefits will be increased opportunities for education and health care, and \nthe enhanced nutritional status of families in general, and children and women in particular.  ", " 17\n \n72.  The use of selection criteria that target poor areas for project interventions will ensure \nthat investments in the development of the livestock subsector are directed to poorer areas of \nthe  western  regions  of  the  country.  If  during  implementation  it  becomes  apparent  that \nindigenous  people  are  a  major  potential  beneficiary  group  in  some  of  the  new  project \nsubdistricts, then need-based strategies will be developed together with a detailed plan of action \nto address their specific needs. \n \nD.  Gender and Development Issues \n \n73.  Over 70% of the female population are engaged in livestock rearing. Faced with the \ndouble impediments of a marginalized status in the family, community, and society, and a lack \nof negotiating skills, women have had little or no real participation in decision-making. The \nProject will provide opportunities to address these concerns by (i) strengthening DLS through \nthe provision of a gender consultant for the 6-year project period; (ii) mandating 35% women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  mixed  farmer  groups  and  in  beneficiary  training  activities;  (iii)  requiring  all \ntraining activities to have a session on gender issues, in addition to specific gender capacity \nbuilding activities; (iv) recruiting at least 50% women CLAs to ensure larger outreach and \nbenefits to  women farmers; (v) improving women\u2019s access to technology and extension by \ndirecting  such  training  to  at  least  35-50%  women;  (vi)  stipulating  at  least  35%  women\u2019s \nrepresentation in umbrella ward level farmer coordination committees, and similar executive \ncommittees; (vii) supporting one model woman entrepreneur per project district to increase \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  enterprise  development;  (viii)  ensuring  at  least  50%  women \nbeneficiaries  are  informed  of  project  activities,  including  information  on  credit  and  lending \nmodalities, and the proposed 15 livestock investment models; (ix) strengthening linkages with \nthe Department of Women Development to increase training opportunities for farmer groups; (x) \nfacilitating increased support for gender mainstreaming activities by establishing gender focal \npoints at all project levels to review progress made in addressing gender concerns; (xi) requiring \nall  data  to  be  gender-disaggregated;  (xii)  allocating  a  budget  for  gender  mainstreaming \nactivities; and (xiii) requiring NGO project partners to have at least 50% women field staff. A \ngender action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n \n74.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) has indicated that the mountainous terrain \nand high-intensity rainfall during the monsoon coupled with high population pressure from both \nhumans and livestock lead to land degradation in the midhills in the form of soil loss from \nslopes, landslides, and erosion. None of the surveyed households had any waste treatment \nsystem, nor had they any precise understanding of the effects of a degraded environment. The \nProject will promote stall-feeding or tethered systems for larger animals and semi-scavenging \nand stall-feeding systems for goats. The by-products from these enterprises will be recycled as \ncrop fertilizer, or used as domestic fuel. Growing of fodder trees also contributes fuelwood, \nwhich significantly reduces pressure on forests. The Project will facilitate funding for biogas \ndigesters to reduce dependence on burning dung for fuel. The environmental impacts of the \nproduction activities are expected to be insignificant. The NGO and farmer training programs will \ninclude education on environmental responsibilities and management to develop community \nconsciousness of environmental issues that will extend beyond the life of the Project, including \nthe need to preserve existing biodiversity. The design of markets, slaughter slabs, and milk \ntreatment facilities will include effective and environmentally sound waste and water disposal \nsystems, with adequate budget to construct the required environmental protection facilities. The \nproject enterprise activities are expected to have minimal adverse impact on the environment; ", "18  \ntherefore MFIs do not need to apply an environmental management system. However, DLS will \nconstitute an IEE team to screen processing and marketing subprojects, and prepare reports \nrequired by the Government and ADB. The forage and fodder tree development and project \ntraining  programs  will  significantly  assist  in  developing  better  environment  management \npractices in rural areas. A summary IEE is in Appendix 12.  \n \nF.  Risks \n \n75.  The recent resumption of armed conflict and instability represent a project risk. The eight \nnew project districts have been among the worst affected and are active sites for conflict. \nHowever, because the insurgents view livestock projects as highly pro-poor, they allowed the \nTLDP to continue to operate in areas where they had a strong presence.  This acceptance is \nexpected to prevail in new CLDP districts. \n \n76.  The  commitment  of  MOAC  through  DLS  to  the  Project  and  the  project  approach \n(community based and using a participatory, learning approach) is vital. Both MOAC and DLS \nhave demonstrated a strong sense of ownership and support in preparing CLDP, as evidenced \nby their preparation of the prefeasibility study in 2002. MOAC is also committed to further \nsectoral reform and has prepared a time-bound action plan to address policy issues such as \nfurther reform of the Dairy Development Corporation. The risk of a lack of commitment is \nconsidered very small. \n \n77.  The  project  design  relies  heavily  on  participating  NGOs  entering  into  partnership \narrangements with DLS and DDCs, and correctly interpreting the project\u2019s goals and objectives. \nThe dialogue on participatory planning and the systems learning approach between the PMU \nand  the  participating  NGOs  during  project  implementation  minimizes  this  risk.  The  implicit \nassumption  is  that  participating  NGO  program  organizers  and  program  assistants  will  be \ncapable of training a wide range of beneficiaries after their own training. The risk of this not \nhappening is mitigated by attention to curricula development, training supervision, and post-\ntraining impact evaluation by the PMU. \n \n78.  NGOs have a proven performance in timely and efficient project delivery. The new \nproject area is a natural expansion of the TLDP project area and much of the infrastructure and \nsystems established under the TLDP can be used by the new Project. However, because the \ntrend  in  all  sectors  is  to  utilize  the  strengths  of  local  NGOs,  there  is  the  possibility  of \noverstretching the capacity of the NGOs.  The pressure on NGOs to participate and to perform \nis a risk, but it is manageable, given the training and strengthening of capacity under the \nProject. \n \n79.  The Project\u2019s participatory planning approach will allow flexibility in the selection of \nenterprises by the participating beneficiaries and ensure that the individual makes the best \npossible  choice  of  enterprise.  Also,  this feature  will  allow  participants  to  move  away  from \ninvestment areas that become unprofitable or distorted by externalities such as unfair trade \npractices. Favorable product prices are required to provide farmers with the expected financial \nbenefits. The price assumptions used in the financial and economic analyses are conservative, \nand experience in the TLDP indicates that the risk of adverse producer prices is minimal, as \nmost of the products are consumed or marketed locally, with little outside competition at lower \nprices. Also, the low (but growing) consumption levels of livestock products in urban areas of \nNepal indicate that household consumption and local market demand will readily dispose of the \nProject\u2019s incremental output without a significant adverse impact on producer prices. The risk of \nlivestock diseases will be mitigated by the increased use of vaccines supplied by the private ", " 19\nsector,  CLAs  and  para-veterinarians  to  vaccinate  animals,  and  improved  district-level  DLS \ndisease diagnostic services. \n \n80.  The  devolution  process  lacks clarity,  and  new  roles  and relationships  between line \nagencies and DDCs are required at the district level. MOAC has a devolution plan that includes \ndeputation of staff and allocation of funds for district-level activities to the district. The Project \nwill  be  implemented  according  to  these  guidelines.  However,  few  districts  have  either  the \ncapability or the confidence to implement these technical programs, and the responsibility is \nreassigned to DLS district level staff. Beginning in four districts and extending progressively to \nothers, the Project will work on a pilot basis to develop the capacity and capability of DDC staff \nto integrate the activities of LATs (district and village levels) into those of the DDC, and to \ndevelop close and harmonious working relationships among all stakeholders at that level. The \nrisk is that (i) livestock development may either not be accorded high priority in the district plan, \nor be neglected by the volume of activity from other sectors, overtaxing the underdeveloped \ncapacities and resources at district level; and (ii) undue deferment of elections will affect the \nbottom up and participatory approach of the Project. The risk is considered to be low in both \ncases, and is manageable through the participatory processes employed by the Project. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n81.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  RMDC  will  (a)  designate  MFIs  and \nparticipating banks, satisfactory to ADB, to deliver and manage the microfinance \nactivities  and  training  activities  in  the  livestock  production  and  enterprise \ndevelopment  components;  and  (b)  enter  with  the  MFIs  into  agreements, \nsatisfactory to ADB, to document the flow, accountability, and repayment of the \nmicrofinance activities. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that funds provided under the TLDP for onlending to \nMFIs  continue  to  be  used  for  livestock  loans  to  farmers,  including  potential \nbeneficiaries of the CLDP. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the approved annual development program \nallocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  required  counterpart \nfunding in accordance with the financing plan. \n(iv)  The  Government,  through  DLS,  will  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  duly \nconsidered in project implementation, with respect to both project beneficiaries \nand  staff  recruited  by  DLS  and  participating  NGOs,  in  accordance  with  the \nProject\u2019s gender action plan. \n(v)  DLS will ensure that the participating NGOs provide social development training, \nincluding  awareness  raising,  group  management,  legal  literacy,  governance, \nhealth, and hygiene. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws. Bidding documents will include a clause prohibiting child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, and a clause specifying equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n(vii)  If involuntary resettlement and land or asset acquisition are required for livestock \nmarket  construction,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared.  DLS  will  publicly ", "20  \ndisclose  the  resettlement  plan.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, and will include a complete \ncensus and inventory of losses. DLS will not award any civil works contract for \nany market improvements unless a resettlement plan, in form and substance \nacceptable to ADB, has been submitted to and approved by DLS, the PMU, and \nADB. Land acquisition work including compensation payments will be completed \nbefore possession of land and other assets, in accordance with the agreed-upon \nresettlement plan. \n(viii)  Within  6  months  of loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  conduct  initial  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation-\nmonitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. The data will include income \nand expenditure data, demographic trends, gender issues, issues of ethnic and \nminority groups, nutritional status, child labor, and environmental issues.  \n(ix)   Within 1 year after loan effectiveness, the Government will have implemented \nthe time-bound action plan prepared before loan negotiations to address the \nissues raised in para. 14, and will regularly review progress with ADB. \n(x)  The Government will require 35% women\u2019s participation in mixed farmer groups \nand in beneficiary level training activities, and will implement the gender action \nplan in Appendix 11.  \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n82.  The following are conditions for loan effectiveness.  \n \n(i)  A subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to ADB, between the Government and \nRMDC for microfinance activities will have been executed and become effective \n(subject to the effectiveness of the loan agreement).  \n(ii)  A first year work plan for the Project will have been prepared and submitted for \nADB approval. \n(iii)  The DLS and RMDC will have opened imprest accounts. \n(iv)  The Pokhara Milk Supply Scheme will have been privatized. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n83.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 13,969,000 to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community Livestock \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n                      Tadao Chino \n  President \n \n25 November 2003    ", "Appendix 1          21 \nLIVESTOCK SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Nepal  is  a  rural  country  with  a  population  of  23  million.  Of  the  economically  active \npopulation, 84% are engaged in subsistence-oriented agriculture based on crop-livestock, or \ncrop-livestock-forest integrated farming systems. Livestock farming is closely interrelated with \ncrop production, forest management, management of communal lands, and transportation. Most \nfarmers keep livestock, and animals are an essential part of rural landscape management, \nfarming systems, and the household economy. \n \n2.  The contribution of the livestock sector to the agricultural gross domestic product is \nestimated to be 31% and is expected to increase to 45% toward the latter part of the Agriculture \nPerspective Plan period. Dairy is the most important livestock component, contributing 62.7% of \nthe livestock share in the agricultural gross domestic product, followed by meat (32.4%) and \neggs (5.0%). Livestock exports (animals and products) are 0.2% of total exports and 1.1% of \ntotal imports, and 11.4% and 6.1% of agricultural sector exports and imports, respectively. \n \n3.  The livestock subsector recorded healthy annual growth during the 1990s, averaging \nover 3%, accelerating from 1.6% during the first half of the decade to 3.6% in the second half. It \nis one of the faster growing agricultural subsectors and is considered an important tool in \npoverty reduction, offering the poor family nutrition, income, asset development, and asset \nbuffering against adversity. However, its growth reflects a growing population's propensity to \nkeep livestock, rather than any significant increase in livestock productivity. Individual projects \nlead to productivity improvements but they need to be widely replicated nationwide. \n \n4.  Low  animal  productivity  is  associated  with  underfeeding  (by  about  one  third),  poor \ngenetic quality in milk- or meat-producing animals, low levels of management, and inadequate \nextension  services  (animal  health,  animal  husbandry,  feeding,  and  agribusiness).  Where \nfarmers are supplied with necessary services, increases in productivity do occur; however, \nstaffing  and  budgetary  constraints  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  expand  this  effect \nnationwide. The need to develop private sector-based services to work alongside those of the \nGovernment is becoming more urgent. \n \n5.  The  increasing  rate  of  urbanization  will  result  in  half  of  Nepal\u2019s  population  being \nurbanized within 25 years. An increasing population and rising urban incomes will significantly \nincrease the demand for milk, meat, and eggs. This demand will place significant pressure on \nfarmers to move from subsistence to more commercialized systems of production. Only half the \nurban requirement for milk and meat is being met by local production at the moment; the rest is \nbeing  imported.  The  Project's  emphasis  on  improving  animal  productivity  recognizes  the \ngrowing pressure on local production and imports. \n \n6.  As the population grows and available land resources are divided among the population, \nrural families have increasingly found it difficult to support themselves on a shrinking individual \nshare of the agricultural base. Men are being compelled to migrate for work to support their \nfamilies,  while  women  must  contribute  as  best  they  can  to  family  enterprises  in  rural \nhomesteads. The effect in some areas has been either depopulation of livestock or a reduction \nin its performance. The need for social, economic, or enterprise education to underpin family \nenterprise  activity  is  of  increasing  importance.  The  community  development  and  capacity \nbuilding component of the Project addresses this issue. \n \n7.  The recent conflict in Nepal has affected everyone at village level with destruction of \ninfrastructure  and  a  reduction  in  employment  and  jobs.  Migration  to  towns  in  search  of ", "22           Appendix 1 \nprotection and services has been significant and some families have been displaced. Economic \ndisparity, political frustration, crisis in governance, justice being denied to the poor, and poverty \nhave contributed to the spread of conflict that has affected western areas in particular. Poverty \nis not only widespread but also deep-rooted, and women and children are especially vulnerable. \nWith the aim of improving incomes and employment, the Project has selected eight of the worst \naffected districts. \n \n8.  The presence at Nepal\u2019s border of a large market in India represents an opportunity \nrather than a threat, providing Nepal can increase the volume and consistency of production by \naggregation  of  individual  producers\u2019  production,  improving  supply  chains  from  producer  to \nconsumer, and raising the currently low standards of product quality. Positive trends in this \ndirection will start with the livestock processing component of the Project to address quality and \nprocessing improvement.  \n \n9.  Nepal became a signatory to the World Trade Organization in October 2003. To access \nthe  benefits  of  World  Trade  Organization  membership,  overall  investment  in  agriculture, \nincluding livestock, will have to improve\u2014better infrastructure, improved animal productivity, \nimproved financial systems, market information systems, and quality certification. A number of \nchanges are required: (i) less dependence on imports of live animals for slaughter, and milk \npowder; (ii) increased exports of higher value semiprocessed products such as dairy products, \nhides, and skins; (iii) improved agroprocessing of domestically produced milk, meat, and fibers, \nand  imported  raw  materials  (such  as  wool  for  carpets);  (iv)  stronger  producer-processor-\nconsumer supply chain linkages; and (v) the emergence of niche marketing with high value \nadded and brand recognition. The Project addresses each of these issues. \n \n10.  It is estimated that during the next decade, the annual milk demand of the urban sector \nwill grow by 11.1%. This estimate is based on (i) trends in demand over the last 10 years for \nprocessed fluid milk, (ii) urban population growth of 5.2% in milk-buying municipalities, and (iii) a \nfamily consumption income elasticity of 1.5%. On this basis, milk production of 1.1 million metric \ntons in 2001 needs to increase to 3 million metric tons in 2010/11. This indicates that the \npresent annual growth rate in milk production must increase from around 3% to 17% (when \nimports are excluded) to meet the demand of larger urban centers.  \n \n11.  While the growing demand for milk and milk products in urban areas is not matched by \nlocal production growth, the formal milk market is complicated by government involvement in \nmilk  processing  and  pricing.  Privatization  of,  or  at  least  price  deregulation  by,  the  Dairy \nDevelopment Corporation is a reform that would open the market to further private sector \ninvestment. The seasonal surpluses of milk occurring after the wet season could be addressed \nby allowing supply and demand to establish the producer milk price. These issues and the \npersistent problems with milk quality are being addressed through a time-bound action plan for \nthe Government to deal with the Dairy Development Corporation and pricing issues; and training \nprograms for farmers, collectors, and processors in the marketing chain. \n \n12.  Annual  per  capita  consumption  of  meat  in  Nepal  is  about  8  kilograms,  but  urban \nconsumption exceeds 10 kilograms. The annual increase in total demand for meat has been \nestimated at 2.2% during the 1990s, which is roughly equivalent to the increase in population. \nAnnual growth in domestic production of meat over the same period has been estimated at \n1.9%.  The  growth  in  meat  consumption  is  caused  by  rapid  urbanization  and  associated \nincreases in income. There is a growing gap between supply and demand. It is estimated1 that \n                                                 \n1 Agriculture Perspective Plan. ", "Appendix 1          23 \nnational meat demand will reach 453,000 metric tons in 2010, whereas the present level of \nproduction is below 200,000 metric tons.  \n \n13.  While the demand for livestock products from major urban centers will exceed supply \nwell into the future, the consumption of products in rural areas and secondary towns also \nrequires attention. Because many secondary towns have insufficient supplies of milk and meat \nproduct prices in such localities are very high. The Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP) \ninitiated a strategy of processing and marketing products in smaller district towns (secondary \ntowns) to develop local capability and to generate local employment. Four principles were \napplied in promoting small-scale processing: (i) promoting of public-private partnerships, (ii) \nassisting  entrepreneurs  with  preparing  technical  and  financial  plans  to  establish \nmicroenterprises  suited  to  local  conditions,  (iii)  promoting  the  use  of  locally  manufactured \nequipment,  and  (iv)  practical  hands-on  training  in  product  development  delivered  by \nexperienced trainers. The Project will continue with this approach. \n \n14.  The Department of Livestock Services (DLS) is constrained by (i) staffing restrictions \nthat have led to the use of alternative approaches to address farming communities\u2019 needs \nthrough groups, with the active collaboration of local nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (ii) \nlow morale of DLS staff resulting in poor performance that can be improved through in-service \ntraining and more effective supervision; and (iii) a supply-driven as opposed to an output- and \ndemand-driven approach. However, the use of farmer groups as a focus for extension and \ncredit delivery, facilitated by NGOs, has led to significantly lower farmer transaction costs, and \nan increase in the impact of services delivered to farmers in the TLDP. Until the alternative \napproaches introduced in the TLDP are fully adopted nationwide, there is little likelihood that \nDLS can be fully responsive to the needs of farming communities, or have programs tailored to \nthe  characteristics  and  potentials  of  a  district.  Such  changes  will  take  time,  and  will  be \nsupported by the Project.  DLS also has poor monitoring and evaluation capability that will be \nimproved under the Project.  \n \n15.  Microfinance  for  livestock  is  coming  from  several  sources\u2014banks  as  well  as \nmicrofinance intermediaries that are accredited to and monitored by the Nepal Rastra Bank. \nAccess to credit from commercial banks is limited to wealthier people, because the rural poor \nlack the required collateral, have difficulty in understanding and negotiating the application \nprocess, and live far from bank branches. Gender equity has also been an ignored issue in the \nbanking sector. While women take most of the responsibility for livestock production, they lack \nproperty rights and are therefore unable to take loans because they cannot meet loan collateral \nrequirements. They are also not in the commercial banks\u2019 priority lending agenda. As with the \nTLDP, the Project intends to work through microfinance intermediaries that operate locally bring \nmicrofinance  services  to  the  door  of  the  farmer,  and  advance  microfinance  on  a  group \nguarantee basis, particularly to women. As with the case of delivery of extension advice to \nfarmers (para. 14), this approach leads to significantly lower borrower transaction costs, and far \nimproved service delivery to poor farm families. A subsector road map is in Table A1. \n \n16.  The Rural Microfinance Development Center (RMDC) was registered on 30 October \n1998  as  a  public  limited  company  under  the  Companies  Act  of  1996,  to  act  as  an  apex \nmicrofinance development bank within the framework of the Development Bank Act of 1995. \nRMDC, created with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), through the Rural \nMicrofinance Project, operates as a wholesale lender to microfinance institutions (MFIs), rural \ndevelopment banks, microfinance development banks, rural cooperatives, and NGO financial \nintermediaries that are providing microfinance services to the poor, the marginalized, and the \ndeprived, with the main focus being on women living below the poverty line. RMDC therefore ", "24           Appendix 1 \nmeets the subsector needs identified in para. 15. The primary objective of RMDC is to provide \nmicrofinance facilities through MFIs to poor rural households, particularly women, to undertake \nviable farm and off-farm economic activities, thereby improving their quality of life. In addition, \nRMDC seeks to promote and develop sustainable MFIs through expansion of outreach efforts to \nsupport capacity building and institutional strengthening. It also aims to improve and sustain the \nperformance standards of partner MFIs and conduct performance monitoring and supervision of \npartner MFIs. RMDC\u2019s performance under the Rural Microfinance Project has been highly \nsatisfactory, as it trained MFIs and expanded the number of partner MFIs. RMDC has prepared \nan action plan to continue to expand the number of its partner organizations in the proposed \nproject area over the next year, to ensure that there is sufficient MFI coverage to meet farmers\u2019 \ndemands for microfinance. It will also ensure that newer MFIs receive the required training to \neffectively deliver microfinance to farmers. \n ", "Appendix 1         25  \nTable A1:  Sector Road Map \n \nIndicators \nItem    5  Current  5 yrs  10  15  Remarks \nyears  yrs  yrs \nago \n1  Sector Outcomes             \nDevelopment investment in the  24  40  30  60  80   \nlivestock subsector ($ million             \nequivalent)             \nEmployment in livestock production  85  80  80  75  70   \nenterprises (% of population)             \nEmployment in livestock processing  0.5  0.5  0.75  0.8  1.0   \nand marketing enterprises (% of             \npopulation)             \nPrivate sector share of investment  0.3  0.5  0.7  2.0  5.0   \n($ million equivalent)             \nPoverty reduction impact of  0.01  0.1  0.2  2.0  5.0   \nlivestock enterprises/households         \nrising above poverty line (million       \nhouseholds)       \nContribution to agriculture gross  na  31.0  45.0 \ndomestic product (%) \n2  Sector Outputs             \n(i)  Public Sector              \n  (a) Reform             \n  Privatize Pokhara Milk Supply  Nil  Nil        By 31December 2003 \n  Scheme             \n  Further reform livestock subsector  Nil  Nil        By 31 December 2005 \n  including Dairy Development             \n  Corporation             \n  Update Livestock Master Plan,            By 31 December 2004 \n  finalize new subsector policies and             \n  projects portfolio             \n  Enforce legislation pertaining to            By 31 December 2005 \n  meat and animal feed quality             \n  Remove tax and duty distortions in            By 31 December 2005 \n  livestock industry inputs and outputs             \n  Develop decentralized procedures            By 31 December 2006 \n  and processes consistent with Local             \n  Self-Governance Act             \n  (b) Management             \n  Develop Department of Livestock             Continuous \n  Services capability in community             \n  development and extension             \n  Strengthen monitoring and            Continuous \n  evaluation and market surveillance             \n  capability             \n  (c) Financing              \n  Share of funding (% of agriculture  18.59  25.53  27.0  29.0  30.0   \n  sector budget             \n               \n(ii)  NGO Development             \n  Develop local NGO and MFI            Continuous \n  capability             \n  Expand role of local NGO/MFIs in            Continuous \n  livestock development             \n               \n(iii)  Private Sector             \n  Develop entrepreneurs in marketing            Continuous \n  and processing             \n  Form partnerships with            Continuous \n  municipalities in market development             \n  Support private sector institutions to            Continuous \n  take responsibility for quality             \n  assurance and skills training for             \n  members           ", "26           Appendix 1 \nIndicators \nItem    5  Current  5 yrs  10  15  Remarks \nyears  yrs  yrs \nago \n(iv)  Development Targets             \nGrowth rate for milk (% annual  2.72  2.82  6.6  6.6  8.45 \ngrowth)           \nGrowth rate for meat (% annual  2.2  3.95  4.0  6.22  10.0 \ngrowth)           \nGrowth  rate  for  eggs  (%  annual  5.04  5.5  6.0  7.22  13.7 \ngrowth) \n3  Sector Issues/Constraints  (i)  Privatization of government investment in milk processing \n  (ii)  Reorienting the role and capacity of the Department of \nLivestock Services \n(iii)  Availability of microfinance services to livestock farmers \n(iv)  Availability of livestock insurance as a buffer against risk \n \n4  Actions/Milestones/Investments  By Issue  Schedule  By Agency \nADB  Govt.

This process-oriented project provides indicative subproject investments that will be \nselected  and  approved  during  implementation  using  participatory  processes  involving \ncommunities and implementing agencies. Implementation plans will evolve in response to local \nneeds and priorities identified through active community participation, while implementation \npace will be linked to the rate of development of increased capacities at local level. The \nprinciples observed in the project design include (i) a market, demand-led approach; (ii) gender \nmainstreaming in all components; (iii) public-private partnership arrangements to utilize the \nrespective strengths and resources of the public sector (the Department of Livestock Services \n[DLS]) as Executing Agency, and associated line agencies), the private sector (nongovenment \norganizations  [NGOs],  the  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Center  [RMDC]  as  executing \nagency, community-based organizations [CBOs], entrepreneurs, microfinance intermediaries \n[MFIs], private sector associations, and farmers); (iv) project management flexibility based on \nrelevant monitoring of data from all stakeholders; and (v) accommodation of the Government's \nrequirements for decentralization by improving district authorities\u2019 capacity to implement district-\nlevel activities.  \n \n2.  The  Project  focuses  on  the  development  of  profitable  and  sustainable  livestock \nenterprises and has two key elements: (i) intensive livestock production; and (ii) processing, \nmarketing, and commercialization of livestock subsector services. A livelihoods pilot program for \nfive higher-altitude districts is to be formulated during the first 2 years of the Project, and \nimplemented during the last 4 years.  \n \n3.  Intensive livestock production will be conducted in 22 districts of the three western \nregions of Nepal. District selection is based on criteria similar to those in the Third Livestock \nDevelopment Project (TLDP): (i) incidence and nature of poverty, and the way in which the \nProject can assist poor communities (women and disadvantaged groups); (ii) existing livestock \npopulation (types, density, production, and potential for fodder and productivity improvement); \n(iii) level of farmer interest; and (iv) level of knowledge and experience that can contribute to \ndevelopment in the district. The existence of markets, DLS infrastructure, and the presence of \nother project activities were other factors considered. The intensive livestock production area \ncomprises the following districts:  \n \nRegion  Western  Midwestern  Far Western \nLeader districts (4)  Lamjung,     \nTanahu, \nNawalparasi, \nPalpa \nConsolidation districts  Baglung,  Gulmi,  Banke, Bardiya,  Kailali, \n(10) (less than 3 years  Arghakhanchi  Surkhet   Kanchanpur, \nunder TLDP)  Dandeldhura, \nDoti \nNew districts (8)    Pyuthan, Rolpa,  Baitadi, Achham, \nSalyan, Rukum, \nDailekh, Jajarkot \n \n \n4.  Processing, marketing, and commercialization activities will be conducted in 22 mainly \nplains districts of the Central and Eastern regions, and potential areas in the 22 intensive \n   ", "36           Appendix 4 \nlivestock  production  districts  in  the  three  western  regions.1  The  criteria  used  for  selecting \nintensive livestock production districts also apply to the selection of processing and marketing \ndistricts, coupled with other factors such as the presence of consumers with purchasing power, \nthe presence of traders and other market players, linkages with other and larger markets, and \nthe existence of marketable surpluses. Production has previously been stimulated in these \ndistricts,  and  there  are  sizable  imports  of  live  animals  in  these  areas  that  can  be  further \nprocessed  before  marketing  in  urban  centers.  Production  surpluses  from  the  22  intensive \nlivestock  production  districts  will  be  processed  by  promoting  processing,  marketing  and \ncommercialization  developments  in  appropriate  districts  in  the  three  western  development \nregions.   Identifying demand centers with populations of 50,000 (medium potential) to 200,000 \nor more (high potential) was another key consideration. \n \n5.  The  livelihoods  pilot  program  for  higher  altitudes  will  use  a  multisector  approach \ndeveloped  for  the  remote  districts  of  Darchula,  Jumla,  Mugu,  Humla,  and  Bajhang.  The \nselection criteria included (i) north-south transhumance linkages connecting to the intensive \nproduction  districts  mentioned  (para.  3),  (ii)  potential  for  livestock  improvement,  (iii) \nopportunities for rangeland improvement, (iv) potential for markets, and (v) potential for linkages \nwith other sectors (forestry, tourism, irrigation, and horticulture). \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The  22  processing  and  marketing  districts  are  Bara,  Chitwan,  Dang,  Dhanusa,  Jhapa,  Kapilbastu,  Kaski, \nKathmandu, Kavre Palanchowk, Lalitpur, Mahotari, Makwanpur, Morang, Nawalparasi, Nuwakot, Parsa, Rautahat, \nRupandehi, Saptari, Sarlahi, Siraha, and Sunsari. \n   ", "Appendix 5           37 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1:  Project Cost Summary, by Componenta \n   \n    % % Total\n    NRs Million US$ Million Foreign Base\n    Item Local Foreign Total Local Foreign Total Exchange Costs\n1.

Substantial technical support is required to help the Department of Livestock Services \n(DLS)  implement  a  participatory  community  livestock  development  approach,  evolve  more \ncommunity- and market-focused practices, and transfer some service delivery to the private \nsector. Other critical areas in which DLS has either no capacity or only a limited capacity include \n(i) facilitating the delivery of microfinance to the rural poor through microfinance intermediaries; \n(ii)  establishing  input-  output-based  monitoring  systems  at  community,  district,  and  central \nlevels; (iii) forage development and seed production; (iv) managing project training packages; \nand (v) mainstreaming gender in community livestock development processes. The overall \nleadership and coordination of this support will be critical to the effective implementation of the \nProject.  \n \n2.  The Project will provide 531 person-months of consulting services in two packages (A \nand B) for training, guiding process-related activities, technical support, privatizing the delivery \nof farmer services and inputs, and marketing and agroprocessing. International (67 person-\nmonths) and domestic (464 person-months) consultants will be fielded to support the identified \nbeneficiaries, the desired technology transfer, and change in approach. The terms of reference \nof the two groups are in para. 3. \n \n3.  International  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  design,  application,  and  initial \nmanagement  of  the  participatory  process  and  associated  training  and  extension  activities, \nincluding forage and seed development. Expertise will also be required to assist in establishing \nand  managing  agribusinesses  (meat  and  milk),  and  promoting  privatization  of  veterinary \nservices. The international specialists will also provide specific technical and training support in \nestablishing a monitoring and evaluation system within the DLS network, designing abattoir \nfacilities, and improving the quality of dairy and meat products. The domestic consultants will \nsupport the participatory process and training programs; the delivery of rural microfinance, \nincluding  the  development  of  group  savings  and  credit;  expansion  of  forage,  and  private \nveterinary practices; further development of dairy and meat processing and marketing; live \nanimal  marketing;  and  technical  design.  Domestic  consultants  will  also  provide  support  in \nestablishing  a  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  at  central,  district  and  beneficiary \nlevels; mainstreaming gender in livestock development; assessing environmental impact; and \nadministering the Project. \n \n4.  The technical assistance is in two parts. Part A comprises core positions that are critical \nto the success of the Project. Part B comprises indicative positions that are a best estimate of \nfuture project requirements and are subject to change based on implementation experience and \nchanging requirements. This approach was adopted in the Third Livestock Development Project \nto allow flexible implementation for effective use of the technical inputs. \n \n5.  Package A consultants (49 person-months international consulting services and 368 \nperson-months domestic) will be funded under grant assistance if this can be obtained at a later \nstage. The consultants will be recruited by the Government and will provide overall team \nleadership and advice in implementing the Project. Package B consultants (up to 18 person-\nmonths international consulting services and up to 96 person-months domestic) will be funded \nfrom the loan administered by the Borrower. The Borrower will recruit the consultants through \nfirms selected in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.   \n \n ", " 42            Appendix 8 \nA.

Economic Rationale  \n \n1.  In Nepal, the livestock subsector contributes 31% to agricultural gross domestic product \n(AGDP).  More than 80% of the economically active population is engaged in crop-livestock- \nforest integrated farming systems.  A significant proportion of small farmers and the landless \nkeep a higher proportion of livestock.  Livestock plays a vital role in food security for the poor: it \nis the only source of high value protein in the diet and provides 20% of total household income \nin the hills. \n \n2.  The objective of the Project is to reduce the poverty of farm families in the western \ndistricts of Nepal. Recent poverty assessments show that poverty incidence and severity are \ngreatest  in  the  west.  The  existing  farming  system  suffers  from  low  animal  productivity, \ninadequate access to effective extension services, lack of affordable credit, and limited market \nopportunities.  With the Project, impacts will derive from separate but closely linked sources\u2014a \ntechnical response to improved extension and animal health services and a financial response \nfrom access to affordable investment credit. Market distortions will also be addressed through a \nprogressive reduction of government controls and promotion of community and private sector-\nled interventions\u2014improved service delivery, better hygiene standards and quality control\u2014at \nthe level of both input supplies and availability of processed products.  \n \n3.  The Project will have a direct impact on the lives of 69,000 beneficiary smallholder farm \nfamilies in 690 production pockets. In addition, the wider rural economy will benefit through \nenhanced food production and additional employment opportunities. Investment in livestock \nprocessing  and  marketing  enterprises  will  provide  employment  and  expanded  trading \nopportunities for about 95,000 households. Cash incomes will increase and food insecurity will \nbe significantly reduced. Farmers will benefit from access to improved livestock extension \nservices, which will result in improved and sustainable productivity. Project impacts will be the \nresult  of  a  combination  of  social  preparation,  improved  feeding,  animal  health,  extension \nservices, and access to microfinance.  \n \n  1.  Demand Analysis \n \n4.  The output from the Project will comprise milk, meat, and eggs. The linkages between \nproduction and marketing will be improved by promoting local processing and marketing. Eggs \nand milk will generally be sold in the local area. Live animals are likely to be consumed locally, \nor sold to livestock traders.   \n \n5.  The formal milk collection system initiated by the Dairy Development Corporation, and \nnow including private sector entrepreneurs, has been effective in collecting milk from a wide \narea for sale in Kathmandu and other major towns (accounting, however, for only 10% of total \nmilk production). Experience in implementing the Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP) \nhas shown that secondary towns are a ready market for milk and milk products. It has also \ndemonstrated  that  small  dairies  with  low-cost  technology  are  financially  viable  and  create \nemployment. It is estimated that during the next decade, the annual milk demand from the urban \nsector  will  grow  by  11%.  The  Project  will  follow  the  TLDP  approach  of  promoting  local \nprocessing  and  marketing,  with  emphasis  on  traditional  dairy  product  diversification.  Meat \nconsumption is increasing because of urbanization and rising incomes, but there is a growing \ngap between supply and demand. It is estimated that national meat demand will reach 453,000 \nmetric tons in 2010, whereas the present level of production is below 200,000 metric tons, only \n ", " 44            Appendix 9 \n50% of the total demand. The increasing gap is currently being filled by importing animals from \nTibet and India and meat from overseas. On average, 150,000 head of buffalo, 300,000 goats, \nand 46,000 head of pigs are imported annually from India. The production of goats and buffalo \nunder the Project will meet a ready market within Nepal. Specialist private sector producers, \nparticularly in the Central Region, produce broiler chickens and eggs. There are only a few \ncommercial operations in the 22 intensive livestock production districts in the three western \nregions, and the demand for chicken and eggs is mainly met from imports. Incremental project \nproduction will primarily be consumed within the household, or sold locally. The Project will \npromote commercial poultry operations only in peri-urban areas to meet the growing urban \ndemand for eggs and chicken.  \n \n  2.  Sector Policy Context \n \n6.  Currently, the increasing urban demand for milk and milk products is met by imports of \nmilk powder and milk products. In 2000/01 12,568 metric tons of dairy products were imported. \nThe import volume, with a liquid milk equivalent of 100-120 million liters of milk, was similar to \nthe volume of locally processed milk currently marketed by the formal sector in Nepal.  Local \nproduction capacity is not presently able to meet the rising demand for milk. Poor quality \nsubsidized skim milk powder, and milk (55,000 liters per day) from India are meeting the local \nproduction deficit of 60%. The demand for processed milk in Nepal is estimated at 0.5 million \nliters per day against the local production of 0.2 million liters. The Project addresses this market \ndistortion through policy dialogue with the Government to deregulate milk pricing, which is \ninfluenced by the Dairy Development Corporation\u2019s market operations. Related reforms include \nenforcing legislation pertaining to meat and animal feed quality, and removing tax and duty \ndistortions in the livestock industry. Reorientation of the Department of Livestock Services is \nalso envisaged to strengthen its capability in community development and extension, monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  market  surveillance.  Additionally,  private  sector  institutions  will  be \nsupported to take responsibility for quality assurance.   \n \nB.  Approach and Methodology \n \n7.  To  determine  the  expected  direct  benefits  of  project  livestock  enterprises,  where \nappropriate,  quantifiable  effects  are  valued  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. Many enterprises will be entirely new to farmers, in which case all benefits are \nregarded as incremental. In addition to the quantifiable benefits and costs included in the \nanalysis, the Project can have nonquantifiable effects. Community mobilization, for example, \ncan result in women acquiring skills and confidence to participate more actively in village affairs. \nThe increase in farm household incomes and improved food security will also result in improved \nnutrition and health status among the target beneficiaries.  \n \n8.  Prices and data used in the analysis were obtained from a variety of secondary sources, \nfarmer interviews, and TLDP monitoring data. Assumptions used in the economic analysis \nfollow: (i) import parity pricing for milk products is used; (ii) border pricing is used for buffalo and \ngoat  meat;  (iii)  values  are  expressed  in  constant  2003  prices  to  exclude  inflation;  (iv)  an \nexchange rate of NRs76/$1 is used; (v) for nontraded goods and services, specific conversion \nfactors were estimated, with a shadow wage rate of 0.53 for unskilled labor, consistent with that \nin recent projects in Nepal; (vi) for major tradable commodities, economic values were based on \nborder parity pricing; and (vii) transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies were excluded in \ncalculating economic values.  \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9  45\n1.  Livestock Enterprise Development \n \n9.  A  representative  selection  of  15  livestock  enterprises  was  analyzed  (Table  A9.1). \nSituations at full development were used in calculating financial and economic gross margins. \nInvestment  costs  for  each  enterprise  were  assessed,  including  the  level  of  beneficiary \ncontribution (labor or materials). Particular attention was paid to establishing the enterprise cash \nflow (after financing) to demonstrate the time required for the farmer to repay loans, and \naccumulate working capital to fund ongoing operations from equity. In addition, the financial and \neconomic internal rates of return (FIRR and EIRR) were calculated for each livestock enterprise. \nAs a result of the approach of offering farmers a range of enterprise choices, adoption rates by \nfarmers of individual enterprises could not be assessed with any degree of accuracy. The \nvariable response of individual adopting farmers was addressed by adopting prudent production \nparameters. All enterprises are financially and economically viable. It is expected that about \n50% of the project loans will be for goat production undertaken by women. This enterprise is \nfinancially and economically viable.   \n    \nTable A9.1: Analysis of Livestock Enterprises \n \nEnterprise Margin \n        Incremental Incrementala\n$ \nNo.  Enterprise  Scale  Financial  Economic  Labor  Benefit \n         (NRs/day)  ($) \n1 Village Egg/Chick Farmer  9 layers  256  160  132  104 \n2 Broiler Production  300 birds  270  183  319  270 \n3 Feed Mixer  180 t/yr  751  1102  160  330 \n4 Hill Goat Herd  3 does  112  128  222  110 \n5 Stall-Fed Goat Herd  3 does  203  206  745  96 \n6 Buffalo Cow \u2013 Milk  2 head  532  356  302  273 \n7 Buffalo Cow \u2013 Ghee  2 head  523  372  397  259 \n8 Buffalo Meat Production  2 calves  120  59  26  120 \n9 Buffalo Cow with Calf  1 buffalo cow  128  51  27  128 \n10 Rear Heifer Calf  2 calves  75  34  43  75 \n11 Breeding Sow  1 sow  170  150  36  51 \n12 Fattening Piglets  2 piglets  142  132  30  51 \n13 Forage Replacing Cereal   0.1 ha  50  22  11  10 \n14 Forage \u2013 Wasteland  0.05 ha  34  24  7  24 \n15 Forage \u2013 Seed Producer  0.1 ha  50  18  11  8 \nha = hectare, t/yr = ton per year \na Incremental benefits are indicated for existing enterprises only. \nSource:   Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10.

The impact of the livestock enterprises on poverty was examined. The major impact of \nthe Project would be to increase household incomes and provide better family nutrition. The \nProject will also promote stall-feeding of animals, which will result in improved crop production \nbecause of the increased availability of manure, and environmental benefits resulting from \nincreased forage production. Additional increments to household income will also result from \nmore efficient labor use. Given the degree of unemployment and underemployment that is \ntypical  of  the  districts  of  western  Nepal,  in  financial  terms  this  improved  return  to  labor \n(measured as returns per day) will add substantially to household income, particularly to that of \nthe poor. The project impacts will be generated from separate but closely linked sources\u2014a \ntechnical response to improved technology such as better forage, animal husbandry, and animal \nhealth services; and a financial response from access to affordable microfinance.  \n \n12.  Additional employment opportunities are assessed for each enterprise. Replacing forage \ngathering from the forests (taking most of each day) with forage plots next to the home will give \nsignificant labor savings for women. On average across all enterprises, female labor demand \nwill fall by 13%, and male labor demand will rise by 19%. Given that female labor accounts for \naround 80% of the total livestock enterprise labor inputs, the savings are significant. Women will \nbe able to use the time saved from gathering forage to invest in new cash-earning activities \nsuch as calf rearing and commercial forage production. While incremental daily returns from \nsome enterprises are not great, nonetheless they provide an opportunity to earn incremental \nincome, instead of the existing situation of high labor demand on women to support enterprises \ngenerating low income. Returns to daily labor will also increase; on average the incremental \nreturn to labor from the representative enterprises will increase to $2.25 from the current $0.79 \nper day.1 With a high proportion of labor being female labor, this represents a 190% increase on \nthe current daily labor rate for women ($0.77).  \n \n                                                 \n1 This calculation does not include new activities. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9  47\n13.  Milk  will  be  marketed  through  1,800  dairy  entrepreneurs  trained  by  the  Project. \nIncremental production of about 8 million liters of milk per year (22,000 liters per day) will be \nsold in local markets. Given that the TLDP trained 1,200 dairy entrepreneurs, 25% of whom are \ncurrently selling 23,000 liters daily in their local communities, and that the milk production deficit \nis  large,  marketing  the  expected  incremental  milk  production  is  considered  feasible.  The \nexpected annual incremental goat output of 56,400 head represents only about 20% of the \nofficial goat imports from India. The expected annual incremental butter (ghee) production of \n500 tons has a ready export market in India. Incremental production of other products will be \nconsumed within the project districts, which have a population of 2.4  million households. Given \nthe low but rising per capita consumption of livestock products in Nepal, this population will \nreadily absorb the project outputs. For example, the expected annual incremental output of eggs \nrepresents only 0.5 egg per capita per day. \n \n14.  The  cash-flow  analysis  of  each  enterprise  shows  that  the  costs  associated  with \ndevelopment of the enterprise (debt servicing) are affordable. In addition to servicing the debt, \nfarmers can then accumulate sufficient capital to ensure that they generate adequate working \ncapital within the project life (with the exception of milking buffalo, which takes 10 years to \ngenerate working capital). Given the conservative production assumptions of the enterprise \nmodels,  financial  sustainability  can  reasonably  be  expected  and  will  financially  empower \nbeneficiary farm families considerably. \n \n2.  Comparative Advantage \n \n15.  To determine the viability of the enterprises competing with imports and in view of \ncurrent market distortions (para. 6), an illustrative analysis examined the viability of promoting \ninvestments in livestock enterprises and assessed the comparative advantage of such ventures. \nPolicy action matrices for broiler chicken and buffalo milk production were prepared. Both \nenterprises demonstrate competitiveness under existing market conditions. In both cases, the \nprivate cost ratio is positive, indicating that the enterprise creates additional value added. The \ndomestic  resource  cost  ratio  is  less  than  1  for  both  enterprises,  indicating  their  sizable \ncomparative advantage. While the effective protection coefficients are greater than 1.0 (broilers \n1.3, and milking buffalo 1.6), these are not sufficiently high to indicate that large levels of \ntransfers are occurring.  \n3.  Commercial Marketing and Processing Enterprises \n \n16.  An  important  assumption  underlying  the  project  design  is  that  livestock  enterprises \nundertaken by poor farmers will be sustainable. A key strategy in ensuring sustainability is to \nimprove market access and add value through livestock product processing. To implement this \napproach, one project component seeks to improve livestock processing and marketing. Based \non prudent estimates of throughput and turnover, detailed analyses of a representative selection \nof these facilities were undertaken. The results are summarized in Table A9.3. \n ", " 48            Appendix 9 \n \nTable A9.3: Analysis of Commercial Enterprises  \n    Year 6 Gross  Indicative  Equity \nItem  Units  Margin ($)  Loan ($)  Input ($) \nLive Animal Market  26  7,009    9,750  2,167 \nMilk Chilling Center  37  2,837    5,274  1,172 \nMilk Processing Factory  5         26,236  12,825  2,850 \nSlaughter Slaba  50  6,465  15,706  3,696 \nRetail Meat Shopb  185  5,366    3,731     878 \nSlaughterhouse  5         14,502  25,310  5,624 \nPara-Veterinarian    250  1,840    3,053     679 \n  a Operates on a cost-plus basis for retail butcher partners. \n      b Based on current retail prices. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n17.  The live animal markets will both improve buyers\u2019 access to livestock and introduce \nlivestock weighing facilities to ensure that buyers and sellers interact on an equally informed \nbasis. Livestock weighing before sale will empower farmers. Two important market constraints \nfaced by farmers, being poorly informed about prices and weights, will be removed. Other \ninvestments\u2014milk  chilling  centers,  slaughter  slabs,  and  para-veterinary  services\u2014address \nother  market  failures  by  providing  markets  for  farmers\u2019  incremental  production,  increasing \nemployment opportunities, and supplying quality-oriented livestock services not currently being \nprovided. \n \n18.  The project processing and marketing investments are estimated to create about 5,100 \nperson-years of annual employment. In addition to direct job creation, considerable downstream \nemployment  will  be  created  for  input  suppliers,  construction  contractors,  and  others.  It  is \nestimated that in the dairy subsector, every milk-producing farmer creates eight jobs.  \n \n19.  Sensitivity analyses were performed by assuming various scenarios of increased costs \nand decreased benefits (Table A9.4). EIRR sensitivity analyses with increased direct costs or \ndecreased benefits indicate that the enterprises are robust with a 10% increase in direct costs, \nor a 10% decrease in income. However, the FIRR of two enterprises (community slaughter slab \nat 7% and para-veterinary practice at 8%) show some vulnerability to a 10% rise in direct costs. \nAll enterprises remain generally viable with a 10% increase in capital cost. Community slaughter \nslabs, milk chilling centers and para-veterinary practices show some vulnerability to a 10% fall in \nrevenue. Switching values were also calculated. It was observed that the enterprises have the \ncapacity to withstand shocks of cost overruns and reduction in incremental income. Before \nstarting on any investments during implementation, detailed feasibility studies will be conducted \nto ensure that the investments are financially viable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9  49\nTable A9.4:   Financial and Economic Analyses of Commercial Enterprises \n    Switching Values (%)    Switching Values (%) \n  EIRR  Direct  Income  Capital  FIRR  Direct  Income  Capital \n  (%)  Costs  reduction  Cost  (%)  Cost  Reduction  Cost \nItem  Overrun  Increase    Overrun  Increase \nLive Animal Market  32    89  36    60  17  27  11    25 \nMilk Chilling Center  46  195  50  210  14  10    5    16 \nMilk Processing Factory  43    29  21  460  34  23  17  400 \nCommunity Slaughter Slab  53    70  33  168  14    5    3    10 \nRetail Meat Shop  71    14  12  500  54  12  10  400 \nSlaughterhouse  29  500  29  110  16  10    7    40 \nPara-Veterinarian  46  32  200  180  15  4  3  25 \nEIRR = economic internal rate return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Demand for Credit \n \n20.  The Project\u2019s microfinance component provides the rural poor with access to previously \nunavailable microfinance. To facilitate value addition, employment generation, and sustained \nmarket linkages with livestock production, credit will be made available to entrepreneurs for \nestablishing milk processing plants, milk chilling centers, abattoirs and slaughter slabs, and \nlivestock markets in livestock commercial centers to cater to the growing needs of the urban and \nsemi-urban areas. The Project will provide livestock production loans for goat, buffalo, cattle, \npig,  poultry,  and  heifer  calf  rearing  in  the  22  intensive  livestock  production  districts.  It  is \nassumed  that  80%  of  the  69,000  households  that  will  be  involved  in  livestock  production \nactivities will require loans. Of these, it is assumed that 50% will purchase goats, 30% buffalo, \n5% buffalo for fattening, 10% commercial and rural poultry, 2% heifer calf for rearing, and 3% \npig for fattening.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n ", " 50            Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY  POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

Yes  in Country Poverty Partnership  Yes \n  Agreement?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty: \nThe livestock subsector contributes 31% to agricultural gross domestic product. More than 80% of the economically \nactive population is engaged in crop-livestock-forest integrated farming systems. A significant proportion of small \nfarmers and the landless keep a higher proportion of livestock. Data on investment in livestock per household \nindicates that the poorest make higher investments than the higher quintiles (13.2% of incomes for the poor versus \n4.8% for the highest quintile). Livestock plays a vital role in food security for the poor: it is the only source of high-value \nprotein in the diet and provides 20% of total household income in the hills. The poorest allocate 69% of total \nexpenditures for food, 16 percentage points more than those in the highest decile.  \n \nNepal's poverty ranking is 142nd out of 173 countries, and the human development index of 0.47 is lower than the \nweighted average for South Asia (0.57).  A comparison of human development index values across the five \ndevelopment regions of Nepal highlight significant differences in human capabilities. For instance, the human \ndevelopment indexes of the Mid-Western and Far Western regions at 0.402 and 0.385, respectively, are much lower \nthan those of the Central (0.493), Eastern (0.484), and Western regions (0.479). The gender-related development \nindex follows the same pattern, higher in the Central (0.476), Eastern (0.465) and Western (0.463) regions, and lower \nin the Mid-Western (0.376) and Far Western (0.356) regions. \n \nThe Project covers 48 districts in all the five development regions and focuses on two key elements based on the \nneeds, resource endowment, and potentials of particular districts: (i) intensive livestock production in 22 districts; and \n(ii) processing, marketing, and commercialization of livestock subsector services in 22 other districts. A livelihoods \npilot program for higher altitudes in five districts will be prepared in the first 3 years of the Project, and implemented \nduring the last 3 years.  \n \nThe Project will support the Tenth Five-Year Plan target of livestock output growth rate of 4.9% annually in the region \nby a 2.9% annual increase in livestock production, thereby increasing per capita consumption of livestock products \nfrom 24 kilograms in 2001/2002 to 30 kilograms by 2009. The Project has developed 15 livestock development models \nwhile taking into account cultural preferences, gender, and affordability issues of different categories of farmers, ethnic \ngroups, and castes. The models include several for poultry, goats, pigs, for buffalo and forage; and one for feed \nmilling, thereby expanding the choice of farmers to choose a particular model of investment. The 15 livestock models \nare expected to generate an annual per capita income of NRs6,604 on average, and assist the beneficiaries to \nenhance their livelihood security through increased caloric and nutritional intake of proteins and micronutrients such as \ncalcium and iron.   \n \nThe processing, marketing, and commercialization activities are designed for the better-endowed districts and focus \non the central and eastern development regions where there is good east-west, and north-south road access linking \nthe rural hill hinterlands to the large market in the plains and elsewhere by developing small-scale localized processing \nfor increased employment. The Project will promote the private sector and local authorities to establish enterprises \n(live animal markets, small-scale milk and meat processing, input and output services) based on consumer demand.  \nSupporting para-veterinary service centers and credit facilities will be developed in tandem with small-scale meat and \nmilk businesses. The livestock enterprise component is expected to establish 1,050 enterprises creating 5,100 new \njobs. An increase in milk supply is expected to benefit 95,000 more women and men farmers. \n \nB.

Poverty in the majority of the project districts is higher than the national average of 42%, and is significantly \nhigher for disadvantaged ethnic groups comprising Magar, Limbu, Tamang, and Lamas (58%); lower caste groups, \ncomprising  Damai, Kami, and Sarki ( 68%); and Tharu (48%).   \n ", "                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 10  51\nThe incidence of poverty is associated with low per capita income, and lack of services to increase economic \nproductivity and social services such as education and health. The poor (men and women) lack the means and the \nopportunity to challenge customary conventions. They are difficult to reach and hard to organize into groups as they \nface higher opportunity costs, and have less capacity to wait for investment payoffs. In the past, only a small \nproportion of the poor were given training in improved livestock care, or provided with inputs to pursue these activities \nprofitably. To address these concerns, the Project has five components: (i) community development and capacity \nbuilding, (ii) livestock productivity improvement, (iii) livestock enterprise development, (iv) a livelihoods pilot program \nfor higher altitudes, and (v) project management services. The components are designed to expand opportunities, \nreduce vulnerability, and develop the capability of the poor. \n \nThe Project will identify impoverished areas by conducting needs assessments that will include an inventory of the \nproportion of disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups, among others, to select livestock production pockets and \nbeneficiary households. Poverty and gender considerations are an integral part of the project design. The Project has \nbuilt-in mechanisms to keep track of the distribution of benefits to different categories of men and women farmers, and \nrequires  undertaking  (i)  a  baseline  survey;  (ii)  preparing  records  of  livestock  groups,  partner  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), microfinance agencies; (iii) a participatory monitoring and evaluation system emphasizing \ninvolvement of poor men and women, changes in their well-being (with respect to basic needs, assets, social \nindicators), and savings and credit; (iv) process monitoring through the reports of community livestock assistants; (v) \nperiodic  review  workshops  on  project  progress,  by  local  livestock  action  teams,  local  authorities,  and  other \nstakeholders; (vi) audit reports on NGO performance; (vii) independent midterm evaluation of the Project's results, \npoverty impact ratios, NGO usefulness and sustainability; (viii) benefit monitoring and evaluation studies; and (ix) \napplication of experience from evaluation to shape the future. The Project will develop an information system that will \nidentify key information and indicators at the household, district, department, and ministry levels.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nParticipation strategy    \nThe Project promotes participatory approaches by mobilizing communities through the formation of 3,450 farmer \ngroups of which 35% of the members will be women. Within the groups, the capacity of the participating men and \nwomen farmers to voice their concerns will be strengthened through social mobilization and capacity-building activities \noutsourced to locally based NGOs who will be trained to undertake these activities. All the support, technical inputs, \ntraining, and microfinance will be based on the group approach. In all these processes the village development \ncommittees will be intimately involved, and the community livestock assistants will support women and men during the \nproject period and continue as an independent village resource after project completion.  Livestock action teams will \nplay a significant role in coordinating and implementing activities at the district and farmers\u2019 level. This team of \nstakeholders will become a subcommittee of the Agriculture Development Committee in the District Development \nCommittee in compliance with the Local Self-Governance Act 1999, as devolution proceeds.  \n \nSimilarly, the livestock action teams will be established at the village level to improve agency coordination and farmer \nrepresentation at that level. The Project will form an implementation coordination committee at the central level under \nthe Department of Livestock Services (DLS); with the participation of the Ministry of Local Development; Ministry of \nWomen, Social Welfare and Children; and other concerned line agencies to bring about multisector coordination. A \nhigh-level  steering  committee  will  be  constituted,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives with representation (at least joint secretary level) from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local \nDevelopment, Asian Development Bank, National Planning Commission, and other relevant ministries. The director \ngeneral of DLS will be member secretary. The systems learning approach will gradually be institutionalized in the \norganizational framework of the DLS, and in the project management cycle. \nD.            Gender \nStrategy to Maximize impacts on Women \nThe Project will provide opportunities to address gender concerns by (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of DLS \nthrough the provision of a gender consultant for the 6-year project period;  (ii) mandating 35% women\u2019s participation in \nmixed farmer groups, and in beneficiary-level training activities; (iii) requiring all training activities to have a session on \ngender issues, in addition to specific gender capacity building activities; (iv) recruiting at least 35% women community \nlivestock assistants to ensure larger outreach and benefits to women farmers; (v) improving women\u2019s access to \ntechnology and extension by directing such training to at least 35-50% women; (vi) stipulating at least 35% women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  umbrella  ward-level  farmer  coordination  committees  and  similar  executive  committees;  (vii) \npromoting  one  model  woman  entrepreneur  per  project  district  to  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  enterprise \ndevelopment; (viii) ensuring that at least 35% women beneficiaries are informed of project activities, including \ninformation on microfinance and lending modalities, and the proposed 15 livestock investment  models;   \n ", " 52            Appendix 10 \n(ix) strengthening linkages with the Department of Women Development to expand opportunities to farmer groups; (x) \nfacilitating increased support for gender mainstreaming activities through the establishment of gender focal points at \nthe field to the center to review progress made in addressing gender concerns; (xi) requiring all data to be gender-\ndisaggregated;  (xii) allocating a budget for gender mainstreaming activities; and (xiii) requiring NGO partners to have \nat least 50% women field staff. The Project gives emphasis to women\u2019s non-formal education for business literacy, \nskills development, savings and credit activities, and participation in production and marketing activities.  \n Output Prepared  \n A gender plan has been prepared and is covenanted.   \nE.

Despite the recognition that women do 80% of the work and make many of the day-to-\nday decisions associated with livestock rearing and management, little attention has been paid \nto gender in livestock subsector strategies. Consequently, extension and training are often \nprovided to men on the erroneous assumption that the message will trickle down to women as a \nresult, livestock knowledge has been transferred inefficiently, or not at all, from husband to wife. \nThe Project will address these concerns by taking actions that (i) increase the number of women \nin contact with extension services, (ii) increase gender sensitivity among policymakers and \nmanagers, and (iii) require the impact to be evaluated regularly.  \n \n2.  To build institutional capacity to undertake gender related actions the Project will recruit \na gender consultant for the 6-year project period. The consultant will assist the Department of \nLivestock Services in developing an integrated medium-term policy framework for the subsector \nwith the objective of securing an increasing role for women in livestock development through (i) \na recruitment policy for female staff, (ii) stronger involvement of female staff in planning and \nimplementing at district level, (iii) a field service that is sensitive to and inclusive of gender \nissues, (iv) plans for encouraging women in livestock production and marketing activities, and a \n(v) means of measuring progress in this direction through monitoring and evaluation. All project \nstaff will receive training on gender and organizational change. In addition, all capacity-building \nactivities will be required to have a session on gender issues to ensure that gender issues are \nbeing mainstreamed. Available women project staff will be targeted for training. Gender focal \npoints comprising men and women will be formed from the central to field levels. The project \nmanager will act as the gender focal point and will call periodic meetings of all gender focal \npoints to monitor progress through gender-disaggregated data, and provide feedback during \nimplementation. \n \n3.  At the community level, the Project will (i) mandate 35% women\u2019s participation in mixed \nfarmer groups, and in beneficiary level training and capacity-building activities; (ii) recruit at least \n35% women from among the 390 community livestock assistants proposed for the Project to \npreclude tilting the gender imbalance against women as a result of modernization; (iii) secure \n35-50% women\u2019s participation in technology-related training; (iv) require at least 35% women\u2019s \nrepresentation in umbrella ward-level farmer coordination committees, and similar executive \ncommittees;  (v)  promote  one  model  woman  entrepreneur  per  project  district  to  increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in enterprise development; (vi) develop the concept of male and female \nwomen  leader  farmers  who  will  receive  appropriate  training  to  disseminate  information  on \nproject  activities,  marketing,  credit,  and  lending  modalities  of  the  proposed  15  livestock \ninvestment models; (vii) allocate a budget for gender mainstreaming activities; and (viii) ensure \nequal pay for work of equal value. Male-only groups will not be formed under the Project. To \nincrease women\u2019s participation, farmer group discussions, meetings, and training will be held at \ntimes and locations convenient to women. Documentation of women\u2019s participation compared \nwith that of men will be maintained by the Project. Selection criteria for potential NGOs to \nundertake  social  mobilization  work  will  include  sensitivity  to  gender  issues.  NGOs  will  be \nrequired to have at least 50% women field staff. Additional literacy training will be provided to \nwomen at locations where a low level of literacy is likely to constitute a constraint to livestock \nenterprise development. \n ", " 54           Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the Community Livestock Development \nProject was conducted by means of on-site visits, review of literature, meetings and workshops \nwith stakeholders, and team interaction. This appendix gives a summary of the IEE. \n \nB.  Project Description \n2.  The Project will be implemented in 48 districts of Nepal. Livestock production programs \nwill  be  undertaken  in  22  districts  where  an  estimated  69,000  beneficiary  households  are \nexpected to benefit from project activities. In this area are over 1.5 million ruminant livestock \nunits, reared largely under free grazing conditions. The Project will focus on social mobilization, \nraising  awareness,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  farmers  and  other  stakeholders  to \nparticipate in planning and implementing the Project. The Project will improve the animal feed \nbase in quality and quantity by promoting forage legumes and fodder trees. Some livestock \nsuch as pigs and poultry will be reared under intensive management, and the stall-feeding of \ngoats and larger ruminants will be encouraged. Environment-friendly biogas technology will \nreceive priority in the animal production districts, and microfinance will be provided to farmers. \nLivestock enterprises being offered to communities are those that poor families, women, and \ndisadvantaged groups have already expressed interest in adopting. \n \n3.  A second component of the project concerns processing and marketing of livestock and \ntheir products. The component covers an area of about 22 districts with 2.4 million households, \nof which 95,000 are expected to benefit. In these districts commercialized livestock production \nunits are emerging along roadsides and within, and adjacent to, urban centers. For livestock \nprocessing  and  marketing  development,  the  Project  provides  commercial  credit,  technical \nbackstopping,  and  various  inputs  such  as  live  animal  markets,  milk  chilling  centers, \nslaughterhouses,  slaughter  slabs,  and  several  livestock  product  processing  and  retailing \nfacilities.  \n \n4.  A study will also be carried out in five high-altitude districts to establish a knowledge \nbase and a livelihoods pilot program on livestock production, and a marketing system suited to \nthe underdeveloped, poorly accessible, and environmentally sensitive characteristics of the \narea.  \n \n5.  One component is devoted to enhancing the capacity of farmers, and village- and \ndistrict-based livestock professionals and para-professionals, and strengthening the capacity of \nthe Department of Livestock Services (DLS) and other relevant institutions in the project area \nto manage livestock and natural resources in an environmentally beneficial manner.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n6.  The project area ranges in altitude from 100 meters above sea level in the lowlands to \n7,893 meters above sea level in Lamjung district, and covers lowland, low hills, middle hills, \nand  mountains.  The  project  area  can  be  divided  into  subtropical,  warm  temperate,  cool \ntemperate,  sub-alpine,  and  alpine  climatic  zones.  Climatic  variations  are  extreme  due  to \naltitude,  aspect,  and  the  continentally  influenced  seasons.  Steep  slopes  and  high  rainfall \nintensity result in significant soil loss and landslides. Active alluvial soils are found in the river \nvalleys and in the plains. The ratio of cultivated to noncultivated area in the western project \n ", "                                                                                                                       Appendix 12  55\narea ranges from 3.17 to 63.6, and grassland occupies 3.2-31.5% of the land area. Livestock \nholdings per household vary from 3.1 to 7.0 units in the project area, though in parts of the \ncommercialization, processing, and marketing areas this figure reaches 100 livestock units.  \n \n7.  The biological diversity in the project area is of international importance in terms of the \nnumber of globally threatened species of wild flora and fauna. Tropical riverine forest and \ntropical evergreen forest dominate the lowland areas, and suffer greatly from lopping for \nanimal feed and felling for timber. The middle hill ecosystem (1,000-3,000 meters above sea \nlevel) has the greatest species diversity. Highlands above 3,000 meters are the meeting \nplaces for two major geographical regions in which 38 ecosystems are found. Within the \nproject area, several endangered plant and animal species are found. Blue sheep, wild goats, \nthe snow leopard, the single-horn rhinoceros, and freshwater dolphins are notable. Though \nhumans have disturbed much of the forest area, large tracts are still intact. There are no \nreports  of  plant  or  animal  species  that  have  become  extinct,  though  some  of  them  are \nendangered.   \n \n8.  Within the project area are heritage sites of international importance such as the Royal \nChitwan National Park, wetlands such as the Koshi Tappu in Sunsari district (a wetlands \nhabitat for waterfowl). These environmental resources are protected under the Forest Act \n(1993), National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973), and the Environment Protection \nAct (1996). The area is also rich in different aspects of human culture maintained by different \nethnic groups.  \n \n9.   The monsoon is the main rainy season (June-September) when over 80% of the total \nprecipitation and periods of high rainfall intensity occur. Over 6,000 rivers and streams drain \nthe country. Several major rivers and a large number of their tributaries drain the project area. \nThe Sapta Koshi in the east, Seti Gandaki, Kali Gandaki, and the Karnali are the major river \nsystems.  \n \n10.  Ambient air quality is excellent in most parts of the project area. In the remote areas, \nindoor  air  pollution  is  common  due  to  use  of  fuelwood  in  cooking.  In  the  urban  areas, \nparticularly  in  the  Kathmandu  valley,  air  quality  is  deteriorating  because  of  vehicles  and \nindustrialization. Urbanized areas also have problems with water, air, and noise pollution. \nDeforestation, land degradation, and landslides are environmental hazards already occurring in \nthe project area.  \n \nD.   Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n11.   The Project may produce some potential long-term impacts. Native species (genetic \nbiodiversity)  such  as indigenous  forage  species  may  not  be  able  to  compete  with  faster \ngrowing introduced species, and the latter may dominate. Action research and on-station \nevaluation of introduced species are warranted. These effects are not easy to mitigate as they \nare directly related to the economic benefit requirements of poor families. The impact on the \nenvironment of uncontrolled grazing and trampling, especially in forests, grazing lands, and \ncommunal lands, is potentially a higher risk but also manageable. In product processing areas, \nthe environmental problems are more related to pollution of water, air, and land, but they can \nbe mitigated. \n \n12.   Stakeholders  need  to  internalize  the  concept  of  environmental  protection  and \nconservation of indigenous species at each stage and each level of project implementation. \nStakeholders\u2019  environmental  awareness  must  be  raised  and  their  capacity  to  manage  or \n ", " 56           Appendix 12 \nreduce  environmental  impacts,  both  positive  and  negative,  must  be  improved.  Mitigation \nstrategies  include  avoiding  environmental  damage  or  risk  through  proper  planning,  using \nenvironmentally sound technology and designs, and controlling adverse impacts by adopting \nproper management practices. \n \n13.  The Project will impact on the environment, especially in forested areas (used as a \nfodder source), grazing lands, communal lands (due to grazing, trampling, and littering), and on \nthe genetic diversity of native species. However, the environmental impacts of these activities \nwill  be  insignificant.  In  areas  where  processing  and  marketing  are  being  developed,  the \nenvironmental impact is more related to pollution of water, air, and land. Each of the project \ncomponents has been screened for significance and potential impacts. During implementation \nthe environmental impacts of marketing and processing subprojects will be carefully screened. \n \n14.  Land  Pollution.  Solid  waste  such  as  plastics,  packing  materials,  animal  manure, \ndisposable syringes, and animal health center waste can pollute the land, and a method of \nseparating biodegradable and recyclable elements of the wastes at source is required. These \nwastes need to be appropriately disposed of in biogas plants, in designated manure and \ncompost pits, or in trenches for burning waste. \n \n15.  Water  Pollution.  Without  guidelines  and  controls,  effluent  generated  by  dairy \nprocessing plants, slaughterhouses, slaughter slabs, and milk chilling centers is likely to be \ndischarged into natural water bodies. Effluent, especially that containing chemicals, adversely \naffects humans, and aquatic and plant life. Each processing unit will be required to treat \neffluent, and treatment systems will be included as part of the project design and approval \nprocess.  Sedimentation,  oxidation,  or  treatment  ponds  where  the  discharge  will  meet \nacceptable biochemical oxygen demand levels will be implemented. \n \n16.  Air Pollution. Air pollution occurs within and around intensive livestock production \nfacilities  such  as  piggeries,  processing  units,  slaughter  sites,  and  marketing  areas.  Such \nimpacts can be minimized by maintaining acceptable hygiene standards (to be established \nunder the Project), spraying water, and using air purifiers and other air-circulating devices \nwithin the units as appropriate. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements for Environmental Monitoring \n \n17.  At the national level, the National Planning Commission and the Ministry of Population \nand Environment are the main institutions mandated to formulate and enforce environment \npolicy and law for the country. They also monitor trends and effects.  \n \n18.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), the Department of Livestock \nServices (DLS) and its district offices, and district development committees will be directly \ninvolved in implementing the Project. The capacity of these institutions to undertake IEEs of \nthe  subprojects  is  weak,  as  none  of  the  institutions  have  staff  trained  in  environmental \nappraisal. Several private consultancy firms have project experience and could be contracted \nfor this purpose. Unfortunately, almost all of them are based in Kathmandu and do not have \ntheir own staff, as they recruit professionals on a short-term basis. Therefore, environmental \nmonitoring capacity and capability are largely lacking in the livestock subsector at field level, \nand any monitoring tends to be project related and project driven.  \n \n19.  The livestock productivity component will have insignificant environmental impacts. For \nthe livestock processing and marketing component, a four-step environmental management \n ", "                                                                                                                       Appendix 12  57\nprocess will be followed. First, a small environment monitoring team will be established in the \nplanning division of DLS, and DLS staff capability will be strengthened through technical \nassistance, training, and awareness building. The monitoring team will be independent of the \nimplementation team. It will visit subprojects that are potentially environmentally significant, \nhold meetings, and prepare terms of reference for the subproject IEE as required by the \nEnvironment Protection Act and regulations. Second, the IEE team will prepare a preliminary \nsummary of relevant information and checklist. Third, the IEE team will meet with relevant \nstakeholders to solicit their views on the subproject, and collect field level information through a \nconsultative process as required by the environmental regulation. Fourth, the IEE team will \nanalyze the information collected, recommend appropriate cost-effective mitigation measures \nto cope with any adverse impacts, while enhancing any positive impacts. The IEE team will \nprepare a report on its findings as prescribed by the Environment Protection Act and in the \nGovernment\u2019s approved format, which is acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe subproject report will be submitted to DLS, MOAC, and ADB. Training in environmental \nmonitoring will also be given to district-based staff. Provision has been made for an appropriate \nbudget to implement needed mitigation measures. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n20.  There is a close relationship between poverty and environmental degradation. Most of \nthe project area has a high incidence of poverty and communities are not well served by \ngovernment institutions. All the components of the proposed Project will be screened following \nADB guidelines. The IEE shows that the adverse impacts of the Project are not severe, and \nare  general  in  nature.  Therefore,  the  Project  does  not  need  further  study  such  as  an \nenvironmental impact assessment. Properly implementing prevailing laws and regulations and \nraising the awareness of stakeholders, and the prompt response of institutions to the adverse \nimpacts can mitigate the likely adverse effects. Proper implementation of the recommendations \nand monitoring are essential to achieve the desired objectives. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R276-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031129131651Z", "Title": "R276-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040301141328+08'00'"}}
