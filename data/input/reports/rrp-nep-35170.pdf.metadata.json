An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary is a core appendix. \n \nThis  process-oriented  Project  will  finance  subproject  investments \nthat will be selected and approved during implementation through \nparticipatory  processes  involving  communities  and  implementing \nagencies.  Implementation  plans  will  evolve  in  response  to  local \nneeds  and  priorities \nthrough  active  community \nparticipation, while the pace of implementation will be linked to the \nrate of development of increased capacities at the local level. The \nProject focuses on the development of profitable and sustainable \nlivestock  enterprises  and  has  two  key  elements:  (i)  intensive \nlivestock  production  (22  districts);  and  (ii)  processing,  marketing, \nand  commercialization  of  livestock  subsector  services  (22  focus \ndistricts, and selected districts from the intensive production area). \nA livelihoods pilot program for five higher-altitude districts is to be \nformulated during the first 2 years of the Project, and implemented \nduring the last 4 years.  \n \nThe  intent  of  national  plans,  the  views  of  poverty  and  conflict-\naffected  communities, \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Livestock  Subsector  Review,  and  the \nADB  country  program  strategy  all  recognize  the  need  for  a \nlivestock  project  with  a  poverty  reduction  focus:  one  that  meets \nthe needs of the poor; effectively links production and marketing; \ncreates  jobs;  and  meets  urban  market  requirements  for  meat, \nmilk, and eggs currently supplied by imports. \n \nThe  objective  is  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  rural \ncommunities in the project area. Its purpose will be to improve the \nlevels  of  food  security,  nutrition,  incomes,  and  employment  for \n164,000  families  through  increased  productivity  of  the  livestock \nsubsector in an environmentally sustainable and socially equitable \nmanner, while enhancing the capacity of the people to manage an \nongoing process of development themselves. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $33.0  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $2.8 million, and local currency of \ninvestments  cover \n$30.2  million  equivalent.

The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nThe  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS),  and  the  Rural \nMicrofinance Development Center (RMDC) \n \nA  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  oversee \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in \nKathmandu, headed by a project manager to supervise all project \nactivities.  Project  management  will  be \nsupported  and \ninstitutionalized  by  delegating  responsibilities  to  DLS  regional \ndirectors  in  each  of  the  five  development  regions  to  implement \nspecific elements of the Project; and to coordinate, supervise, and \nmonitor  and  evaluate  project  activities.  A  working \nlevel \nimplementation  coordination  committee  will  be  established  to \nguide  the  PMU  on  a  regular  basis.  A  group  of  established \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  with  operational  networks \nin  the  project  area  will  implement  the  community  development \ncomponent  and  RMDC  will  onlend  microfinance  to  microfinance \nintermediaries  for  the  livestock  productivity  improvement,  and \nlivestock processing and marketing components.  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject  Benefits  and \nBeneficiaries \n\n  v\n\nthrough \n\nlocal  contractors \n\nfrom  prequalified \n\nAll procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Major items such as equipment and vehicles will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  to \nimprove infrastructure and facilities scattered over a large area will \nbe  in  many  small  contract  packages.  All  civil  works  will  be \nprocured \nlocal \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nA  team  of  consultants  will  support  project  implementation  and \nassist  DLS  in  implementing  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  engage \nconsulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB \nfor  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Quality-and  cost-based \nselection  procedures  will  be  used  in  recruiting  the  consultants. \nADB  approved  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  for \nGovernment recruitment of consultants. \n \nThe  main  project  benefits  will  be  the  incremental  production  and \nsale of milk, meat, eggs, and animals that will be consumed by the \nbeneficiaries  or  sold  in  local  markets.  Incremental  household \nincomes  are  expected  to  increase  by  50%  and  levels  of  family \nnutrition to rise by 20%. Livestock services such as extension and \nanimal  vaccinations  by  village-level \nlivestock  development \nassistants  will  also \nincrease.  The  Project  will  provide \nenvironmental  benefits:  manure  produced  from  cattle  is  used  as \nfertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nIt  is  estimated  that  about  49%  (0.6  million)  of  1.2  million \nhouseholds  in  the  project  area  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The \nProject  will  assist  69,000  households \nthe  poor \nhouseholds  in  targeted  production  pocket  areas)  to  improve \nlivestock  production,  concentrating  its  activities  on  landless \nhouseholds  and  those  headed  by  women  that  are  among  the \npoorest  of  the  poor.  In  addition,  95,000  households  will  benefit \nfrom project marketing and processing interventions. Provision of \na readily accessible flow of financial and social resources through \nthe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  raising \nbeneficiaries\u2019  levels  of  empowerment,  particularly  in  accessing \nservices;  (ii)  increasing  the  number  of  organized  farmer  (female \nand  male)  groups  and  ward-level  associations;  (iii)  increasing \nincomes \n(iv) \nhousehold \nimproving \nthrough \nthe  nutritional  status  of  households \nconsumption  of  livestock  and  dairy  products;  (v)  increasing \nwomen\u2019s  employment  and  enhancing  participation  and  self-\ndetermination;  and  (vi)  encouraging  the  growth  of  environment-\nfriendly economic enterprises. \n \n\nthrough  employment  generation; \n\n(50%  of \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions  The recent resumption of armed conflict and instability represent a \nproject risk. The eight new project districts have been among the \nworst affected and are active sites for conflict. However, because \nthe  insurgents  view  livestock  projects  as  highly  pro-poor  it  is \nexpected  that  the  Project  can  operate  in  the  districts  of  the \nongoing  Third  Livestock  Development  Project\u2014as  it  has  been \ndoing during the insurgency\u2014in addition to moving into new ones. \n  \nThe  Project\u2019s  participatory  planning  approach  will  give  the \nparticipating  beneficiaries  flexibility  in  selecting  enterprises  and \nensure  that  the  individual  makes  the  best  possible  choice.  Past \nproject  experience  indicates  that  the  risk  of  adverse  producer \nprices  is  minimal,  since  most  of  the  products  are  consumed  or \nmarketed  locally,  with  little  outside  competition  at  lower  prices. \nAlso,  the  growing  consumption  levels  of  livestock  products  in \nNepal  indicate  that  household  consumption  and  local  market \ndemand  will  readily  dispose  of  the  Project\u2019s  incremental  output \nwithout  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  producer  prices.  The  risk \nof  the  outbreak  of  animal  diseases  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nincreased  use  of  vaccines  supplied  by  community  livestock \nassistants.    The  participatory  processes  used  in  the  Project  will \nminimize  the  risk  that  the  transfer  of  technical  staff  and  funds  to \nthe  district  level  as  part  of  the  devolution  process  in  Nepal  will \nexceed district level capacities and resources.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Community Livestock Development Project (CLDP).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \n Of  Nepal's  economically  active  population,  84%  are  engaged  in  subsistence-oriented \nagriculture. Farmers keep livestock to provide essential support for agriculture production (draft \npower and compost), nutrition for the family, and household income. Livestock farming is closely \ninterrelated  with  crop  production,  management  of  communal  lands,  and  remote  area \ntransportation. Animals also are assets that serve as a buffer against risk.  \n \n3. \nIn 2001 there were approximately 7 million cattle, 3.6 million buffalo, 0.9 million sheep, \n6.5 million goats, 0.9 million pigs, and 19.8 million poultry in Nepal. Nepal has one of the highest \nlivestock populations per capita and per unit of cultivable land of any country in Asia. Reliance is \non low-producing local breeds that are adapted to the environment. Improved livestock accounts \nfor  only  8%  of  cattle,  21%  of  buffalo,  6%  of  sheep,  14%  of  goats,  41%  of  pigs,  and  50%  of \npoultry.  These  percentages  are  increasing  as  farmers  in  areas  of  good  access  respond  to \nmarket  signals  by  introducing  new  animals  and  using  improved  animal  breeds.  In  the  12-year \nperiod to 1997/98, pig and poultry numbers increased significantly (72 and 79%, respectively). \nGoats (21%), buffalo (18%), and cattle (11%) increased more slowly. Sheep numbers are static, \nas  are  those  of  yak.  Farmers  with  smaller  landholdings  of  between  0.2  and  0.5  hectare  (ha) \nkeep almost 25% of the livestock. People who have either no land or own less than 0.2 ha own \nabout 11% of the livestock. \n \nThe  contribution  of  the  livestock  sector  to  the  agricultural  gross  domestic  product  \n4. \n(AGDP) is currently estimated at 31% and is planned to increase to 45% by the latter part of the \nAgriculture Perspective Plan period (1995-2015). Dairy is the most important livestock activity, \naccounting  for  62.7%  of  the  total  livestock  sector  contribution  to  AGDP,  followed  by  meat \n(32.4%) and eggs (5.0%). Growth performance in the agriculture sector varies and the share of \nits  subsectors  has  changed  over  time.  During  1995-1996  to  1999-2000,  the  share  of  food \ngrains, cash crops, livestock, and fisheries increased, whereas that of other crops and forestry \ndeclined.  The  better  performing  subsectors  were  fisheries  (9.7%),  cash  crops  (5.6%),  and \nlivestock (3.6%). In contrast, the growth rate for food grains was 2.3%, other crops 3.0%, and \nforestry 0.3%. Livestock (animals and products) exports are 0.2% of total exports and 1.1% of \ntotal  imports,  and  11.4%  and  6.1%  of  agricultural  sector  exports  and  imports,  respectively. \nIncome from livestock is high as a proportion of total income, particularly for poorer farmers over \n20% of whose income is from livestock, compared with around 9% for wealthier farmers.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \nThe  livestock  subsector  recorded  healthy  growth  during  the  1990s  and  averaged  over \n5. \n3%  growth  annually,  accelerating  from  1.6%  during  the  first  half  of  the  decade  to  3.6%  in  the \nsecond  half.  It  is  a  fast-growing  agriculture  subsector  and  is  considered  important  in  poverty \nreduction.  The  Agriculture  Perspective  Plan  targets  the  livestock  subsector  as  an  engine  for \n\n                                                 \n1 Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom \n\nof Nepal for Preparing the Community Livestock Development Project. Manila. \n\n\f 2\n\ngrowth in agriculture. The Ninth Plan (1997-2002) emphasized the prominent role expected of \nthe  livestock  subsector  in  national  development,  recognizing  that  it  tends  to  redistribute  urban \nwealth to the rural areas. The current Tenth Plan (2002-2007) seeks to bring about a substantial \nand sustainable reduction in poverty, and also gives special emphasis to the livestock subsector \nas a strategic means to reach poor communities and meet poverty reduction targets. \n \n6. \nDevelopment through livestock can reach over 80% of the rural population. The livestock \nsubsector  is  one  of  the  key  entry  points  for  programs  to  reach  the  rural  poor  and,  if  correctly \noriented  to  small  animals,  its  development  favors  disadvantaged  groups,  such  as  women  and \npoorer farmers. Livestock needs to be brought more fully into the farming system as a revenue \nsource  in  its  own  right,  rather  than  just  to  support  crop  enterprises.  At  present,  extension  and \nanimal  health  support  are  insufficient  due  to  poor  area  coverage,  and  use  of  inputs  is \nconstrained by a lack of awareness among communities and . Current returns to labor are low: \nfrom  about  $0.11  per  day  and  averaging  $0.53,  or  about  $40  per  year  for  poor  families. \nLivestock  development  is  also  environmentally  neutral,  contributing  to  land  stability  and  soil \nimprovement  from  forage,  reduced  pressure  on  grazing  lands  from  stall-feeding  systems,  and \nreduced dependence on forest resources through the use of biogas. Women undertake 70% of \nthe  work  and  make  many  of  the  decisions  associated  with  livestock  keeping;  therefore,  key \nissues continue to be providing animal health and production services (including microfinance) \nto men and women farmers and improving the ability to use the services; and greater attention \nto the gender balance of farmer groups, umbrella organizations, and cooperatives.  \n  \nThe recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) Nepal Livestock Sector Review2 concluded \n7. \nthat,  while  the  livestock  subsector  is  very  complex,  with  many  crosscutting  issues  and \ninterrelationships with other sectors, it is a very important part of the agriculture sector and has \na key role to play in the country's development and in poverty reduction. While a great deal of \nprogress  has  been  made  over  the  last  30  years  and  innovative  new  approaches  have  been \ndeveloped,  new  approaches  are  still  needed.  Future  development  must  include  (i)  more \neffective social enhancement (strengthening of farmer organizations, and self-determination); (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening (changed attitudes, including sensitivity to issues of gender and social \nexclusion, improved  capabilities,  and  levels  of  cooperation  by  government  services-providers); \n(iii)  increased  commercialization  involving  market  chain  development,  value  addition,  import \nsubstitution, and greater participation of the private sector; and (iv) improved coordination and \nsupport among government, the private sector, and aid agencies. The subsector analysis is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nBetween 1980 and 2003 ADB supported three livestock development projects with loans \n8. \ntotaling  $37  million  (Appendix  2).3  The  projects  covered  24  of  the  75  districts  of  Nepal.  Still \nmany  poorer  families  are  not  captured  by  this  development  assistance.  In  addition,  many \ndistricts  in  the  west  have  had  limited  ADB  or  other  external  assistance.  It  is  in  these  deprived \nareas that the recent insurgency has been most pronounced and where livestock development \nwill help meet some of the frustrated expectations of communities.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2001.

The \nsecond project was rated partially successful primarily because too much emphasis was placed \non  introducing  technological changes  that  beneficiaries  were  unable  to  adopt.  While  capability \nlevels and orientation in the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) have changed as a result \nof the support provided under the Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP), more needs to \nbe  done  to  develop  a  facilitation-  and  output-oriented  organization.  Livestock  action  teams \n(LATs)  at  the  district  level  in  the  TLDP  have  facilitated  intersectoral  cooperation,  but  more  is \nneeded  at  the  village  and  central  levels.  The  Government  has  also  realized  that  greater \nemphasis  on  social  mobilization  and  gender  equality,  and  involvement  of  the  private  sector \n(community-based  organizations \n[NGOs],  and \nentrepreneurs)  is  required.  With  the  creation  of  new  positions  frozen  in  the  civil  service,  DLS \nmust develop new approaches to deliver services more effectively with existing staff resources.  \n \n10.  While  the  national  incidence  of  poverty  is  42%,  incidence  in  the  majority  of  the  project \ndistricts  is  estimated  at  60%.  Poverty  is  highest  among  the  disadvantaged  castes  (68%)  and \nethnic minorities (58%). Poverty reduction through livestock involves reducing risks for the poor, \nimproving  food  security,  improving  levels  of  nutrition  and  incomes,  improving  livelihoods,  and \nproviding  an  effective  asset  buffer  against  adversity.  Small  animals  purchased  locally  with \nmicrofinance,  supported  by  improved  animal  health  services,  improved  levels  of  feeding,  and \nincreased  knowledge  of  animal  husbandry  methods  and  marketing  provide  poor  farm \nhouseholds with the means to reduce poverty. Livestock production, processing, and marketing \nare  a  base  for  entrepreneurial  activity  and  stimulate  job  creation.  Milk,  for  example,  has  an \nemployment multiplier effect of around 8:1. \n \n11. \nUnequal development, economic disparity, crisis in governance, high underemployment, \nrural poverty, social exclusion, and gender discrimination have produced a fertile ground for the \nrecent conflict to take root in rural communities, particularly in the Mid-Western Region. There \nhas  been  significant  migration  to  towns  in  search  of  protection  and  social  services.  Other \nfamilies  have  been  completely  displaced.  For  those  who  stayed,  the  conflict  has  affected \nhousehold  work  and  productivity,  increased  household  expenses,  and  led  to  domestic  stress. \nAffected communities have indicated that they should be mobilized and unified in their efforts to \nparticipate in effective income generation and employment programs, and be trained to improve \ntheir capabilities and capacities. \n \n12. \nNepal is a rapidly urbanizing country where 50% of the population (30 million) will live in \nurban  areas  by  2035  (20%  or  4  million  currently  live  in  urban  areas).  The  rural  population  will \ncome  under  increasing  pressure  to  supply  urban  consumers  with  their  meat,  milk,  and  egg \nrequirements. Nepal imports approximately half its current requirements for meat and milk, and \nimport substitution is a national objective. The marketing of live animals and meat is undertaken \nentirely  by  the  private  sector  and  is  reasonably  efficient,  although  quality  standards  require \nimprovement. Marketed milk is either locally produced milk or processed milk reconstituted from \nimported milk powder. The formal milk marketing system shows marked seasonal differences in \nproduction,  and  oversupply  occurs  in  some  months.  Where  milk  collection  is  not  possible, \nseasonal surpluses are converted to butter. \n \n13. \nDLS  has  had  the  experience  of  implementing  three  major  ADB  loans  for  livestock \ndevelopment, and participated in several other smaller projects over the last 20 years (Appendix \n2).  There  is  a  history  of  successful  experiences  and  innovation  on  which  to  base  further \ndevelopment  activity  (paras.  7\u20139).  DLS  is  considered  one  of  the  more  innovative  government \ndepartments  in  Nepal  and  is  more  attuned  to  development  priorities.  It  has  pioneered  several \n\n\f 4\n\ninnovations  such  as  public-private  partnerships,  cross-sectoral  cooperation,  and  small-scale \nentrepreneur  development.  DLS  has  the  technical  competence  to  implement  another  project, \nbut  the  changes  in  managerial  ability,  role  orientation,  cross-sectoral  linkages,  extension \ncapability, and competence started under the TLDP need to be continued and reinforced. DLS \nconstraints  also  include  a  staff-to-farming  household  ratio  of  1:2,000,  insufficient  training  for \ntechnical  staff,  lack  of  specialization,  mobility  problems,  weak  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncapacity,  and  an  input-driven  orientation  as  opposed  to  a  demand-  and  output-driven  outlook \nthat public-private partnerships can address.  \n \n14. \nSeveral  policy  issues  identified  in  the  ADB  Nepal  Livestock  Subsector  Review  require \nattention.  They  include  (i)  giving  equal  opportunities  to  livestock  industries,  which  are  treated \ndifferently  from  agriculture  industries  in  the  value-added  tax,  tax  exemption,  discounted \nelectricity  charges,  bank  interest  rates,  and  import  duties;  (ii)  enforcing  existing  legislation  on \nproduct  quality  control,  hygiene,  and  environmental  management;  and  (iii)  privatizing  facilities \nand  services  that  the  private  sector  can  undertake.  Privatization  of  the  Pokhara  Milk  Supply \nScheme and the future role of the Dairy Development Corporation in the subsector are issues \nthat need to be resolved. The Government has prepared a time-bound action plan to address \nthese policy issues. \n \n15. \nThe intent of national plans, the views of poverty and conflict-affected communities, the \nrecommendations of the subsector review, and the ADB country program strategy all recognize \nthe need for a livestock project with a poverty reduction focus, one that meets the needs of the \npoor,  particularly  poor  women;  effectively  links  production  and  marketing;  creates  jobs;  and \nmeets urban market requirements for meat, milk, and eggs currently supported by imports. The \nproject design is consistent with these objectives. \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\n16. \nThe Project aims to reduce poverty among poor rural men and women through gender \nand  socially  inclusive  development.  Its  purpose  will  be  to  improve  levels  of  food  security, \nnutrition, incomes, and employment from livestock production and small-scale livestock related \nenterprises in 48 districts (all 5 development regions) of Nepal (map, page vii). The Project will \nbenefit  164,000  families  through  increased  productivity  of  the  livestock  subsector  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable and socially equitable manner, while enhancing the capacity of men \nand women to manage the development process. The project framework is in Appendix 3. The \nproject concept and area are described in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  project  comprises  five  components:  (i)  community  development  and  capacity \n17. \nbuilding,  (ii)  livestock  productivity  improvement,  (iii)  livestock  processing  and  marketing,  (iv)  a \nlivelihoods pilot program for higher altitudes, and (v) project management services. \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Development and Capacity Building \n\n18. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  build  the  capacity  of  all  stakeholders  to  a  level \nwhere  they  contribute  significantly  to  the  Project's  goal  and  purpose.  Experience  in  the  TLDP \nhas been that for communities to benefit from livestock productivity improvement programs, they \nmust  be  made  more  aware  of  their  rights  and  responsibilities,  and  risks,  and  have  their \ncompetency  levels  raised  before  development  activities  begin.  The  project  design  recognizes \n\n\f  5\n\nthat time must be allowed and the effort increased for community awareness building. The most \ntime  and  effort  are  required  in  districts  worst  affected  by  poverty  and  the  recent  civil \ndisturbances. The component targets not less than 35% women participants. \n \n\na. \n\nCommunity Development \n\n \n19. \nDLS  will  work  in  partnership  with  local  NGOs,  and  district  and  village  development \ncommittees (DDCs and VDCs) in 22 districts to undertake poverty and social mapping to identify \nand  target  poorer  and  disadvantaged  communities,  and  intensive  livestock  development \npockets  (areas)  according  to  established  criteria.  An  NGO  or  consultant  group  will  undertake \nbaseline studies involving quantitative and qualitative assessment in each district. The data will \nprovide a clearer understanding of the socioeconomic characteristics of the beneficiaries and a \nbenchmark against which project progress may be measured.  \n \n20. \nTargeted  communities  in  approximately  690  selected  intensive  livestock  development \npockets will be informed of project opportunities, their responsibilities and risks associated with \nparticipation, and the rights of communities through awareness programs run by NGO partners. \nThe NGOs, supported by DLS, will assess the training needs of communities (male and female), \nand  training  programs  will  be  village  based,  farmer-to-farmer,  and  oriented  toward  enterprise \neducation  (embracing  technology,  legal  literacy,  and  basic  agribusiness).  Training  will \nstrengthen farmer organizations and farmer capabilities. It will focus on leadership, records and \nbookkeeping, financial savings, meeting procedures, animal health and production technology, \nforage development, and local-level marketing. \n \nThe  capacity  of  district-level  organizations\u2014CBOs  and  NGOs\u2014to  participate  in  the \n21. \nProject  will  also  be  assessed  in  the  baseline  study.  Potential  partners  of  at  least  one  locally \nbased NGO per district and two microfinance intermediaries (MFIs) will be identified, along with \ntheir  capacity-building  requirements,  using  selection  criteria  established  in  the  TLDP.  Local \norganizations  will  be  strengthened  in  the  areas  of  social  mobilization  (including  their  ability  to \nincrease  the  participation  of  women  and  the  poor),  livestock  enterprise  activity,  and \nmicrofinance  to  (i)  improve  their  performance  as  project  partners,  (ii)  encourage  balanced \ngrowth in the organization, and (iii) reinforce their prospects of sustainability. \n \n22. \nConcurrently,  awareness  of  the  Project\u2019s  aims  and  activities,  and  new  roles  and \nresponsibilities  will  be  raised  among  DLS  staff  and  key  staff  in  the  project  DDCs.  Project \norientation  programs  will  be  held,  followed  by  a  three-module  package  of  training  that  will \ninclude (i) social mobilization; (ii) improving animal production, and agribusiness; and (iii) basic \nprinciples of animal and product processing, and marketing.  \n \n23. \nApproximately  3,450  farmer  groups,  comprising  at  least  35%  women  in  mixed  groups, \nwith 20 households per group will be formed after social mobilization activities. Communities will \nselect an enterprise from a menu of 15 livestock enterprises, and groups will be formed around \nshared interests, such as poultry and goat groups. Group members will agree on an objective, \nprepare  an  action  plan,  and  commit  to  a  savings  program.  Elected  group  leaders  will  receive \ntraining  in  leadership,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  bookkeeping  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency  of  group  activities.  All  group  members  will  receive  enterprise  education  training. \nAn  umbrella  committee  will  coordinate  the  activity  of  5-10  groups  to  address  any  production-\nrelated  or  input  and  output  supply  problems,  consider  the  growth  of  small  economic  units \n(groups) into larger legally recognized economic units (cooperative societies), address broader \ncommunity needs, and liaise with lower levels of administration such as VDCs and DDCs. \n \n\n\f 6\n\nCommunities will be encouraged to identify a member of their community for training as \n24. \na  community  livestock  assistant  (CLA).  Approximately  one  CLA  per  two  production  pockets  is \nenvisaged (345 CLAs), and at least 35% of the CLAs will be women. The CLAs are expected to \nbecome self-supporting, obtaining income from the sale of services to the community, or to the \ncommunity through the VDC. CLAs will also have the opportunity to undertake para-veterinary \ntraining to improve their ability to support themselves.  \n \n\nDevelopment of CBO and NGO Capacity \n\n25. \nNGOs selected at district level will be approved by the project management unit (PMU) \naccording to criteria used in the TLDP, and will be allocated operational areas. They will deliver \nsocial mobilization and training services to the participating beneficiaries over 3-4 years. Female \nrepresentation in the NGO and orientation of its activities toward women will be part of the NGO \nselection  criteria.  Capable  MFIs  will  distribute  microfinance  to  beneficiaries.  The  Rural \nMicrofinance  Development  Center  (RMDC)  or  microfinance  trainers  will  provide  capacity \nbuilding  training  to  approximately  100  MFIs,  focusing  on  existing  institutions.  In  districts \ncurrently  without  MFIs,  NGOs  or  farmer  cooperatives  will  be  assisted  to  become  MFIs. \nParticipating NGOs will be trained to improve their social mobilization and group strengthening \ncapability. \n \n\nDevelopment of DLS Capacity \n\nb.  \n \n\nc. \n \n\n26. \nIn addition to training to improve the extension capabilities of DLS district-level staff, 35 \nmore  senior  DLS  officers  and  40  district  officers  will  be  trained  locally  in  leadership, \nmanagement, and planning to strengthen the project implementation and managerial capacity of \nthe  department.  To  strengthen  DLS\u2019s  capabilities  in  the  participatory  systems  learning \napproach,  provision  is  made  for  DLS  staff  training.  Short-term,  awareness  building  immersion \ntraining  will be  provided  for  another  250  DLS  staff,  DDC,  and  private  sector  partners.  All  DLS \nstaff  will  receive  gender  and  organizational  change  training  to  ensure  that  gender  is  fully \nintegrated into DLS structures and practice. The project manager will be the gender focal point \nat  the  central  level.  Junior  technicians  and  their  assistants  will  be  trained  in  production, \nprocessing and marketing to develop specialist support at the district level. DLS staff will receive \ntraining  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  from  the  Project's  technical  assistance  team.  Two \nmembers  of  the  recently  formed  Directorate  of  Livestock  Marketing  Promotion  will  receive \ntraining in marketing, market development, market information systems, and quality assurance \nand control systems. Department of Food Technology and Quality Control and DLS officers will \nalso  be  trained  in  meat  inspection,  milk  and  meat  quality,  and  quality  control  and  assurance \nsystems. Quality control laboratory facilities will also be improved. \n \n\nd.  \n\nDistrict Development Committee Strengthening \n\n \n27. \nDDC  staff  in  at  least  22  intensive  livestock  districts  will  receive  project  orientation  to \nstrengthen their capacity to implement livestock development programs. Key staff will be trained \nin  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Members  of  the  district  and  village  LATs  will \nreceive  training  in  gender  awareness,  microfinance,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Women \nstaff members will have priority for this training.  \n \n\nDevelopment of Private Sector Capacity \n\ne. \n \n\n28. \nThe Project will assist DLS to work with representative private sector organizations such \nas  the  Nepal  Dairies  Association,  Nepal  Butchers  Services  Committee,  and  poultry  and  feed \n\n\f  7\n\nmillers  associations  to  develop  their  capabilities  to  implement  member  awareness,  quality \nassurance, and member training programs. The objective is to begin to shift responsibility to the \nprivate sector for a number of the needs of private sector entrepreneurs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLivestock Productivity Improvement \n\n29. \nFifteen  livestock  improvement  models  have  been  identified  as  suitable  for  small  and \nresource-poor  farmers.  Thus,  the  69,000  men  and  women  farmers  participating  in  the  22 \nintensive  production  districts  will  have  a  degree  of  choice  in  selecting  project  activities. \nEmphasis will be on smaller investments such as forages, goats, calf rearing, pigs, and poultry \nto enable a higher proportion of poorer families (including women and disadvantaged groups) to \nparticipate. Financial savings by beneficiaries will be promoted. \n \n30. \nTraining  is  proposed  for  feed  millers,  poultry  farmers,  and  feed  ingredient  suppliers  to \nimprove the standard of feed formulation. Feed standards will be reviewed, and the Department \nof Food Technology and Quality Control and DLS will undertake quality control with 520 district-\nlevel  staff  being  trained  in  this  area.  Approximately  20  entrepreneurs  will  be  assisted  to \nestablish  small-scale  feed  mill  operations  in  the  intensive  livestock  production  areas,  with \nemphasis on using forage legumes to replace imported protein ingredients. Better quality feeds \nwill benefit all producers, including the poor. Loans will also be provided for biogas digesters, in \ncooperation with the Biogas Support Program.  \n \n31. \nForage-led development will involve importing new genetic stock, demonstrating species \nand their management to farmers, and establishing a viable forage seed industry. DLS district \nstaff  will  extend  forage  technologies  and  management  to  farmers  using  the  successful \nstrategies developed under the TLDP. DLS staff will be trained in seed production systems and \ntechnologies suitable for adoption in Nepal.  \n \nRMDC and its network of MFIs will provide microfinance credit. A total of 100 MFIs are \n32. \nlikely partners. RMDC or a specialized training institution will train 60 less experienced MFIs to \nprovide microfinance services in six project districts currently without such services. Borrowers \nare  more  likely  to  be  women;  therefore  training  will  emphasize  gender  issues  related  to \nmicrofinance. An equity contribution of 10% in the form of labor is expected from small farmers \nborrowing to establish their selected enterprise. Improvement in microfinance performance will \nbe facilitated through a program of training for MFIs, farmer leaders, and DLS district staff.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLivestock Processing and Marketing  \n\n33. \nThis component aims to develop small-scale and localized processing and marketing of \nlivestock  products  for  the  benefit  of  producers.  The  component  will  create  employment  and \nimprove product quality. Microcredit for small enterprises will be made available to commercial \nbanks through RMDC. Approximately 1,050 small enterprises will be created, with investments \nranging  from  live  animal  markets  to  milk  chilling  centers,  milk  processing  facilities,  slaughter \nslabs,  meat  shops,  and  para-veterinary  practices.  The  enterprises  are  estimated  to  provide  at \nleast 5,100 person-years of permanent employment. The project initiatives will be demand-led \nand  private-sector  based.  Where  possible,  local  bodies  (municipalities  and  DDCs)  and  private \nsector entrepreneurs will be encouraged to develop integrated market facilities to be known as \nthe  livestock  commercial  center  approach.  Awareness-raising  activities,  market  supply  and \ndemand appraisals, market linkage analyses, and stakeholder participatory planning exercises \nwill precede market development activities. A range of training will be available to improve the \n\n\f 8\n\nskills  of  those  already  involved  in  processing  and  marketing,  and  to  bring  new  entrepreneurs \ninto the business. \n \n34. \nIn  at  least  22  livestock  commercial  centers,    existing  live  animal  markets  will  be \nimproved  and  new  markets  developed.  Approximately  2,400  farmer  leaders,  of  which  at  least \n35%  will  be  women\u2014in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  promoting  a  minimum  of \n35% women\u2019s participation in all development activities\u2014will be made aware of how they may \nextend their influence along the market chain to the markets, and 1,680 farmers and traders will \nreceive  training  in  market  management.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  improve  the \nquality and hygiene standards of slaughter, meat handling, and meat selling.  \n \n35. \nThe Project will provide credit for 370 new dairy enterprises comprising chilling centers, \nsmall-scale and cottage dairies, and cold chain retail outlets. The strategy will be to encourage \nentrepreneurial activity in and around district towns and to provide consumers with an increased \nsupply of improved products. A significant campaign to raise farmer awareness of milk hygiene \nwill be undertaken along with new dairy entrepreneur training, milk processor training, milk plant \nmaintenance,  and  milk  product  quality  management.  As  in  the  TLDP,  the  objective  will  be  to \nstimulate local processing and marketing microenterprises, generate employment, and increase \nthe supply of products to meet the demand of consumers in rural towns.  \n \nIt  has  become  clear  from  the  TLDP  that  processing  and  marketing  initiatives  may  be \n36. \nlimited by low levels of consumer responsiveness and that consumer awareness and education \nprograms must run parallel with market development activities. The Project will support a series \nof  mass  media  programs  directed  at  urban  consumers  to  make  consumers  more  aware  of \nhygiene  and  quality  issues,  and  the  reasons  behind  market  improvement  initiatives.  The \noutcome, as has been indicated by TLDP experience, is appreciation by consumers of quality \nassurance systems, and increased demand for improved quality products. \n \nAs  the  demand  for  animal  health  and  production  services  in  commercialized  farming \n37. \nareas is outstripping the ability of DLS to provide services, farmers show a strong demand for \nthe services of private para-veterinary personnel. Based on TLDP\u2019s successful experience and \nneeds, the Project will support the establishment of 250 para-veterinarians. DLS will be assisted \nto link with and provide training to strengthen private sector organizations. Technical assistance \nwill be provided to the new Directorate of Livestock Marketing Promotion to develop policies and \naction plans, and to build working linkages with the private sector.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLivelihoods Pilot Program for Higher Altitudes \n\n38. \nA  limited  knowledge  of  successful  strategies  to  improve  livestock  production  in  the \ndifficult higher altitude environment prevents DLS from delivering programs suitable for the high \nhills.  The  Project  will  support  (i)  the  cost  of  data  assembly  on  experience  from  similar  agro- \necological  regions,  (ii)  surveys  and  investigations  into  the  changing  nature  of  transhumant \nlivestock  keeping  in  the  pilot  program  area,  (iii)  participatory  rural  appraisal  studies  into  the \ndevelopment needs of people in the pilot area, and (iv) participatory preparation of a multisector \nplan  to  be  implemented  in  the  final 4  years  of  the  Project. The  proposed  pilot area  comprises \nfive districts that are on traditional north/south transhumance routes.  \n\n \n5. \n\nProject Management Services \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  support  DLS  with  the  required  financial  and  technical  assistance \nresources necessary to ensure the effective implementation, management, and coordination of \n\n\f  9\n\nSpecial Features \n\nproject  activities.  A  PMU  will  be  established  in  Kathmandu  and  staffed  by  DLS.  It  will  be \nsupported by project implementation technical assistance in two locations, Kathmandu (project \nmanagement,  and  processing  and  marketing  support  for  the  processing  districts),  and \nNepalgunj  (for  livestock  productivity  improvement  districts,  and  training  in  implementation \nactivities).  \n \nC. \n \n40.  More emphasis than in the TLDP will be placed on social and community development \nactivities  to  prepare  poorer  communities  for  livestock  improvement  activities.  Experience  in \nNepal shows that a livelihood approach and provision of adequate time (3-12 months) for social \nadjustment  are  necessary  for  livestock  development  interventions  to  be  successful.  Ensuring \nthe sustainability and replicability of livestock enterprises to other areas will be emphasized.  \n \n41. \nFour districts previously under the TLDP have been selected to act as leader and pilot \ndistricts.  They  are  leader  districts  in  the  sense  that  their  achievements  in  the  area  of  farmer \nmobilization,  NGO  partnerships,  interaction  with  the  private  sector,  and  forage  development \nactivities can serve as a model and a learning experience for replication in new project districts. \nThe  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy  also  requires  that  new  arrangements  be  introduced \nfor  funding  at  the  district  level,  and  interaction  between  the  DDCs  and  DLS  district  staff.  The \ndistricts will be used as pilot districts where the new relationships and modalities for replication \nelsewhere can be developed, tested, and demonstrated. \n \n42. \nThe pocket package and group approach has been modified from the TLDP approach. \nIn association with the district livestock services officer, LATs, and VDCs and DDCs will identify \npocket areas on the basis of poverty-affected communities in wards. Thus, the pockets will be \narea  based,  rather  than  commodity  based.  Linkages  will  be  developed  between  farmers  in \ngroups and the lower levels of administration in wards and villages. Ward livestock committees \nwill  coordinate  the  activities  of  groups,  assist  with  organizing  inputs  and  services  such  as \ninsurance,  and  represent \ninterests  of  group  members  with  village  and  district \nadministrations.  \n \nCommunities,  in  the  form  of  farmer  groups  and  their  associations,  will  have  three  foci. \n43. \nThe primary focus will be on making their enterprise activity financially successful and capable \nof growth. The second will be on addressing community concerns and needs such as literacy, \nhealth, or other social needs. The third will be on the concept of helping others less fortunate in \nthe community by using their own experience to assist other groups to establish and function. \nFor  the  three  foci  to  work  well,  women  need  to  be  strongly  represented,  not  only  in  a \nparticipatory sense, but also in decision-making roles. The target is involvement of at least 35% \nwomen.  \n \nD. \n \n44. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $33.0  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  service  charges  during  construction.  The \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.8  million,  or  about  8%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $30.2 million equivalent, or about 92% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency costs include an estimated $4.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by \nDLS  and  investors.  The  project  cost  estimates  summarized  in  Table  1  should  be  regarded  as \nindicative only.

The loan will fund $2.8 million (100% of the \ntotal foreign exchange cost), and $17.2 million equivalent of the local currency cost (67% of the \ntotal  local  currency  cost).  The  Government  has  been  requested  to  provide  $5.0  million \nequivalent, or 15% of the project cost. RMDC  and MFIs will contribute $6.5 million toward the \ncost of livestock enterprise development, or 20% of the project cost. The beneficiary households \nthat  receive  microfinance  packages  and  entrepreneurs  that  receive  agro  enterprise  packages \nwill  contribute  1.5  million  or  4%  of  the  project  cost  through  their  labor  and  cash  inputs  in \nestablishing the livestock and small business enterprises. Local cost financing is justified given \nthe poverty-oriented nature of the Project, and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n46. \nThe Borrower will be the Government of Nepal. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% during \nthe grace period and an interest charge of 1.5% per annum during the amortization period. The \nGovernment will relend to RMDC the portion of the ADB loan required for investing in livestock \nenterprises, in accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreement. The subsidiary \nloan  agreement  will  contain  procedures, \nimplementation \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. RMDC will in turn onlend to participating MFIs under subloan \nagreements,  and  the  MFIs  will  use  these  funds  to  provide  microfinance  to  farmers  and \nentrepreneurs.  The  subloan  agreements  will  specify  procedures,  terms  and  conditions,  and \n\nterms  and  conditions,  and \n\n\f  11\n\nimplementation arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The Government will provide the funds to the \nPMU for the livestock development portions of the Project.

Having managed three previous projects for ADB, DLS \nhas  shown  that  it  has  the  necessary  organizational  structure  and  staff  skills  to  manage \nsuccessfully a large and diverse project. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) \nwill appoint a project manager in its head office. The Project will fund a small PMU that will be \nlocated  in  Kathmandu,  and  which  will  be  staffed  by  a  team  of  seconded  staff  comprising  (i)  a \nmanagerially competent project manager, (ii) deputy project manager, (iii) two planning officers \n(field  programs,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation),  (iv)  two  junior  technical  officers,  (v)  an \naccounts officer, and (vi) adequate support staff.  \n \n48. \nThe  PMU  will  act  as  a  facilitating  unit.  It  will  (i)  prepare  annual  work  plans  and  the \nrelevant  project  reports  in  consultation  with  other  service  providers;  (ii)  supervise  all  project \nactivities  and  the  performance  of  the  implementing  agencies  and  service  providers;  and  (iii) \nmonitor  and  evaluate  project  activities,  project  outputs,  and  expected  impacts.  The  PMU  will \nalso  ensure  that  several  crosscutting  issues  are  firmly  embedded  in  project  activities:  (i)  the \ninclusive  and  participatory  systems  learning  approach  to  be  used  in  the  Project,  (ii)  gender \nawareness  and  gender  equity,  (iii)  environment  concerns  and  mitigation  measures,  and  (iv) \ngood  governance.  To  deliver  project  services  effectively  to  48  districts,  management  of  the \nProject will be supported and institutionalized by delegating  to the DLS regional director in each \nof the five development regions the responsibility to coordinate, supervise, implement selected \nactivities, and monitor and evaluate project activities.  \n \n49. \nAs  EA,  RMDC  will  distribute  project  microfinance  services  and  credit  funds  to \nparticipating MFIs and commercial banks on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. RMDC is \na capable institution, which is satisfactorily implementing the ADB-financed Rural Microfinance \n\n\f 12\n\nProject.4  NGOs  will  be  recruited  to  form  farmer  groups  and  provide  preparatory  social \nmobilization  before  providing  microfinance  to  group  members.  Through  the  Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of Nepal and commercial banks, RMDC will provide the credit for livestock \nprocessing and marketing. At the midterm review, these arrangements will be reviewed.  \n \n50. \nA project steering committee (PSC) has been established to oversee the implementation \nof the Project. It will meet as necessary, but not less than twice a year, to review progress and \nresolve  policy  issues.  The  secretary  of  MOAC  will  chair  the  committee,  which  will  include \nrelevant joint secretaries from MOAC; ministerial representatives from  the Ministry of Finance; \nMinistry  of  Forests  and  Soil  Conservation;  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Welfare; \nMinistry of Local Development; the National Planning Commission; and RMDC, with the director \ngeneral of DLS as member secretary. \n \n51. \nAn  implementation  coordination  committee  (ICC)  will  be  established  to  guide  the  PMU \non  a  more  regular  basis.  Chaired  by  the  director  general  of  DLS;  the  committee  will  comprise \nheads  of  DLS\u2019  directorates  for  animal  health,  marketing,  training  and  extension,  and  animal \nproduction;  MOAC\u2019s  Department  of  Food  Technology  and  Quality  Control;  as  well  as \nrepresentatives  of  the  Department  of  Women  Development;  milk,  meat,  and  poultry-based \norganizations;5 RMDC; the Nepal Rastra Bank, and regional project managers. Representatives \nof  other  stakeholder  organizations6  will  be  co-opted  as  necessary.  The  ICC  will  meet  every  2 \nmonths.  Its  responsibility  will  be  to  address  and  resolve  implementation  issues,  to  advise  on \ntechnical matters, and to advise the PSC on policy matters.  \n\n2. \n\nComponent Implementation \n\n \n\n \n\n52. \nThe  PMU  will  implement  the  Project,  in  cooperation  with  the  various  DLS  directorates \nand  RMDC.  It  will  also  be  responsible  for  organizing  training  at  the  central  level,  such  as  the \nproposed management training for DLS officers. The regional project managers will implement \ntraining and technical backstopping being made available through regional training centers, and \ncoordinate activities between districts in their regions. \n \n53. \nDistrict livestock offices, and NGOs will undertake district activities involving community \nlivestock \nawareness  building,  social  mobilization,  gender  awareness,  group \nproductivity improvement, farmer training, community-based livestock development assistance, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation.  District  implementation  arrangements  will  be  further  defined \nduring  project  implementation  to  meet  the  Government's  intention  to  decentralize  fiscal  and \nadministrative responsibility to DDCs. LATs proved an effective mechanism under the TLDP for \ncoordinating  and  aligning  line  agency  programs  at  village  level,  and  establishing  linkages \nbetween  line  agencies  and  DDCs.  This  mechanism  will  be  continued,  extended  to  VDC  level, \nand be institutionalized within the DDC organizational structure. \n \n\nformation, \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years beginning in the first quarter of 2004. Initial \n54. \nactivities  will  include  recruiting  consultants  for  the  PMU;  establishing  a  project  performance \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  1998.

Enterprise  development  and  credit  disbursements  in  new \nproject  areas  will  be  delivered  starting  in  the  third  quarter  of  2004,  while  in  previous  TLDP \nareas,  these  activities  will  continue  without  interruption.  A  summary  project  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nLending Terms and Conditions \n\n \n55. \nThe  cost  of  supervised  microcredit  and  social  intermediation  activities  is  high.  The \nGovernment has agreed to onlend to RMDC, and for RMDC to onlend to MFIs at a level that will \nallow MFIs to obtain an adequate interest spread to cover all costs, cover for bad and doubtful \ndebts,  and  an  adequate  savings  margin.  The  Borrower  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for \nthe ADB loan. It is proposed that the Government relend $5.2 million equivalent to RMDC at a \nservice  charge  of  2%  per  year  for  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  RMDC  will \nonlend  to  MFIs  with  a  margin  of  3.5%,  at  an  interest  rate  of  not  more  than  5.5%.  RMDC\u2019s \nlending spread will be used to cover the cost of bad debts; evaluating and selecting MFIs; and \nmonitoring  their  performance,  credit  risks,  and  profit.  Project  funds  are  separately  available  to \nsupport training in financial management for the staff of 60 MFIs. The cost of funds for RMDC \nwill be reviewed periodically as needed and at the midterm review. Funds onlent to MFIs for the \npurpose  of  providing  loans  to  microfinance  clients  will  be  for  an  initial  term  of  18  months  with \nquarterly repayments of interest and semi-annual repayments of principal. Subject to acceptable \nMFI  repayment  performance,  the  term  of  subsequent  loans  may  be  extended  to  3  years  and, \neventually  5  years.  The  participating  banks  and  MFIs  will  onlend  to  smallholders  for  poultry, \nbuffalo fattening, and goat-rearing (and other small animals); and to entrepreneurs investing in \nprocessing enterprises at prevailing market rates, using the interest rate margin to cover credit \ndelivery  and  management  costs,  other  operating  costs,  and  an  allowance  for  bad  debts  and \nprofit. Livestock loans will be supported by farmer organization insurance schemes, which have \nbeen successfully operated under the TLDP.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable \n\n \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following \n56. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Since  any  civil  works  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed, \nforeign  contractors  are  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding.  Consequently,  all  the  civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in \nto  ADB. \naccordance  with \nPrequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. A \ncontracted private sector engineer under the guidance of the PMU will advise on the award of \ncontracts  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  livestock  processing,  and  market  improvements. \nSupply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more  are  not \nexpected,  but  if  a  contract  becomes  necessary,  it  will  be  awarded  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  those  costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  (other  than  minor \nitems) will be awarded through international shopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used \nfor  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than  $100,000.  The  PMU  will  procure  the \nequipment and vehicles. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n6. \n \n\n57.  The Project will require 531 person-months of consulting services in two packages (A and \nB) for training, guidance of process-related activities, technical support, and privatization issues \n\n\f 14\n\nassociated  with  the  provision  of  farmer  services,  inputs  marketing,  and  agroprocessing. \nInternational (67 person-months) and domestic (464 person-months) consultants will be fielded \nto support the identified beneficiaries and achieve the desired technology transfer and change in \napproach. The EA will select the PMU implementation support consultants for packages A and \nB  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  EA  will  engage  other  required  consulting  services  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures will be used in recruiting the consultants. The Government will undertake advance \nthe  project  start-up.  The \naction \nGovernment has been advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. \n \n\nimplementation  consultants \n\nfor  recruiting \n\nfacilitate \n\nto \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n7. \n \n58. \nThe  civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  generally  be  small  in  value.  To  ensure \neffective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  two \nimprest accounts in the name of the Project at NRB immediately after the effectiveness of the \nloan agreement. Payments for eligible items will be made to DLS through one account, and to \nRMDC  for  microfinance  and  credit  funds  through  the  other  account.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small \ncontracts.  The  imprest  accounts  and  the  SOE  procedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and \naudited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest \naccounts  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The SOE procedure is applicable for reimbursing \neligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  under  the  imprest  account  for  any  individual \npayment  below  $50,000  equivalent.  All  project  expenditures  incurred  by  the  Project  will  be \nsubmitted by the PMU through DLS and by RMDC to ADB for reimbursement. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n59. \nDLS will submit to ADB trimester and annual progress reports on project implementation. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  the  reports,  particularly  addressing  progress  in  meeting  the  project \ntargets.  The  reports  will  include  information  on  the  physical  progress  of  the  project  and  the \nstatus  of  the  project  components.  Within  3  months  of  substantial  physical  completion  of  the \nProject, DLS will submit to ADB a project completion report that will cover the details of project \nimplementation,  cost,  project  performance  management  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n60. \nDLS  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate  identification  of \nincome  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  be  assigned  sufficient  and \nqualified accounting staff, including an accountant. An auditor acceptable to ADB will annually \naudit all the accounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project. The \nAuditor  General\u2019s  Office  of  Nepal  is  acceptable  for  this  purpose.  The  annual  audit  will  include \naudit of the imprest account and SOE procedure. The annual audit report will include a separate \naudit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within \n9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n \n \n\n\f  15\n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \n \n61. \nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  target \ngroups  receive  the  intended  benefits,  the  PMU  will  use  a  participatory  and  gender-sensitive \nproject performance monitoring program modeled on ADB\u2019s monitoring system, which improves \non  the  one  used  in  the  TLDP.  The  Project  will  strengthen  DLS\u2019s  management  information \nsystem and adapt it to the project\u2019s information requirements. Periodic monitoring activities will \nassess  whether  the  project  inputs  and  activities  have  delivered  the  expected  outputs  and \nbenefits to the intended beneficiaries. The monitoring system will also be used to detect at an \nearly stage any discrepancy between the project plan and its execution.  \n \n62. \nThe  PMU  will  ensure  that  initial  district-level  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic \nsurveys  are  conducted,  and  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring \nperformance and for preparing gender-disaggregated benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review \nand concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PMU will submit annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will be \nconducted  to  review  the  progress  of  the  Project  before  the  ADB  midterm  review.  The  EA  will \ncomplete an impact evaluation study before the PMU prepares the project completion report. \n \n\nProject Review \n\n10. \n \n63. \nADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will cover review of the \nperformance of DLS and the PMU, RMDC and MFIs, participating NGOs, and any other project \nimplementing  agencies;  implementation  of  the  loan  covenants  and  the  gender  action  plan; \nphysical  progress  of  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  Project  and  to  adjust  the  project \ndesign and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nEconomic Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n64. \nThe  main  project  benefits  will  be  the  incremental  production  and  sale  of  milk,  milk \nproducts, meat, eggs, forage, seeds, and animals that will be consumed by the beneficiaries or \nsold  in  local  markets.  Household  incomes  are  expected  to  increase  by  50%  from  the  current \naverage of $40 per year, and levels of family nutrition to improve by 20%.  \n \n65. \nIntermediate  outputs  will  be  increased  forage  and  feed  supplies  that  improve  animal \nhealth and productivity, improved care of existing livestock, and reduced risks associated with \nanimal  keeping.  Increased  meat  and  milk  supplies  will  be  available  to  consumers;  support \nservices to farmers will improve with the activities of CLAs and better-trained DLS field staff; and \nlocal NGOs and MFIs will be strengthened. The livestock processing and marketing component \nwill  create  permanent  employment  opportunities  of  about  5,100  person-years,  and  improve \naccess  to  markets  and  farmers\u2019  market  awareness  for  about  95,000  households.  The  Project \nwill  provide  environmental  benefits  in  the  form  of  dung  for  use  as  crop  fertilizer  and  domestic \nfuel,  and  in  biogas  production.  The  Project  will  also  provide  consumer  benefits  in  the  form  of \nmilk, meat, and milk and meat products of improved hygiene and quality. \n \n66. \nA process driven by farmer demand will determine the outputs; so it is difficult to predict \nthe  actual  mix  of  enterprise  investment  and  scale  of  the  outputs.  Therefore,  a  full  benefit  cost \n\n\f 16\n\nanalysis  for  the  overall  project  was  considered  impractical.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  possible  to \nquantify the longer-term benefits of the human capital development activities in the community \nand  capacity  development  components.  Livestock  services,  especially  those  provided  to \ncommunities  by  CLAs,  and  the  private  sector,  will  be  improved.  The  summary  project \njustification and financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 9. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n \nPoor  farm  families  will  be  offered  a  choice  of  one  of  several  livestock  enterprises  that \n67. \nmatch their needs, resources, and circumstances. Group strategies will result in high adoption \nrates of individual enterprises by farmers. The Project will reach 69,000 poorer farming families, \nwhile processing activities will be offered to 95,000 families. There are approximately 1.1 million \nfarming households in the project area, of which 49% are below the poverty line. The Project will \nreach about 50% of poverty-affected communities in production pockets in the project area. The \nProject  will  particularly  target  landless  households  headed  by  women,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups  such  as  ex-bonded  laborers  and  low  caste  families.  Low-cost  enterprises  have  been \nspecifically developed to facilitate access of the target groups to income-generating activities.  \n \n68. \nExpected impacts of livestock enterprises on poverty have been examined. Agricultural \nproduction benefits generally accrue to the owners of the land, but there are additional expected \nincrements to household income through more efficient labor use with the Project. Assuming the \ndegree of unemployment and underemployment typical of the districts of west Nepal, in financial \nterms  this  improved  return  to  labor  (measured  as  returns  per  day)  will  add  50%  to  poor \nhouseholds\u2019 income and raise them above the poverty line.  \n \n69. \nAccess  to  a  regular  and  usable  flow  of  financial  and  social  resources  provided  by  the \nProject  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  raising  beneficiaries\u2019  levels  of  empowerment, \nparticularly  with  regard  to  accessing  services;  (ii)  increasing  the  number  of  organized  farmer \n(female  and  male)  groups  and  ward-level  associations;  (iii)  increasing  household  incomes \nthrough  employment  generation;  (iv)  improving  the  nutritional  status  of  households  through \nconsumption of livestock and dairy products; (v) increasing women\u2019s employment, participation, \nand  self-determination;  and  (vi)  encouraging  the  growth  of  environment-friendly  economic \nenterprises. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nC. \n \nIn  690  poverty-affected  pocket  areas  the  Project  will  improve  levels  of  awareness  of \n70. \ncommunities,  and  promote  improved  and  easy  access  to  skill  development  and  capacity- \nbuilding resources and services. About 3,450 farmer organizations will be strengthened through \nintensive training of leaders and members. Farmer groups will be affiliated at ward level so that \ncommunity  concerns  can  be  more  directly  transmitted  to  the  lowest  levels  of  administration  at \nVDC and DDC levels. This change is expected to lead to greater empowerment of the poor to \ndemand and gain access to services and resources they would otherwise not obtain and will be \na long-term benefit of the Project. Furthermore, NGOs and MFIs will be increased (24 additional \nMFIs will be established) and strengthened to better provide ongoing service to communities. \n \n71. \nSuccessful  livestock  enterprises  initiated  by  the  Project  and  the  social  benefits  arising \nfrom  successful  community  mobilization  will  lead  to  employment  generation  for  the  poor, \nespecially  through  the  development  of  technical  and  managerial  skills  among  women  project \nparticipants.  Social  benefits  will  be increased  opportunities for  education  and  health  care,  and \nthe enhanced nutritional status of families in general, and children and women in particular.  \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n\f  17\n\nGender and Development Issues \n\n \n72. \nThe  use  of  selection  criteria  that  target  poor  areas  for  project  interventions  will  ensure \nthat investments in the development of the livestock subsector are directed to poorer areas of \nthe  western  regions  of  the  country.  If  during  implementation  it  becomes  apparent  that \nindigenous  people  are  a  major  potential  beneficiary  group  in  some  of  the  new  project \nsubdistricts, then need-based strategies will be developed together with a detailed plan of action \nto address their specific needs. \n \nD. \n \n73. \nOver  70%  of  the  female  population  are  engaged  in  livestock  rearing.  Faced  with  the \ndouble impediments of a marginalized status in the family, community, and society, and a lack \nof  negotiating  skills,  women  have  had  little  or  no  real  participation  in  decision-making.  The \nProject  will  provide  opportunities  to  address  these  concerns  by  (i)  strengthening  DLS  through \nthe provision of a gender consultant for the 6-year project period; (ii) mandating 35% women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  mixed  farmer  groups  and  in  beneficiary  training  activities;  (iii)  requiring  all \ntraining  activities  to  have  a  session  on  gender  issues,  in  addition  to  specific  gender  capacity \nbuilding  activities;  (iv)  recruiting  at  least  50%  women  CLAs  to  ensure  larger  outreach  and \nbenefits  to    women  farmers;  (v)  improving  women\u2019s  access  to  technology  and  extension  by \ndirecting  such  training  to  at  least  35-50%  women;  (vi)  stipulating  at  least  35%  women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  umbrella  ward  level  farmer  coordination  committees,  and  similar  executive \ncommittees;  (vii)  supporting  one  model  woman  entrepreneur  per  project  district  to  increase \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  enterprise  development;  (viii)  ensuring  at  least  50%  women \nbeneficiaries  are  informed  of  project  activities,  including  information  on  credit  and  lending \nmodalities,  and  the  proposed  15  livestock  investment  models;  (ix)  strengthening  linkages  with \nthe Department of Women Development to increase training opportunities for farmer groups; (x) \nfacilitating  increased  support  for  gender  mainstreaming  activities  by  establishing  gender  focal \npoints at all project levels to review progress made in addressing gender concerns; (xi) requiring \nall  data  to  be  gender-disaggregated;  (xii)  allocating  a  budget  for  gender  mainstreaming \nactivities;  and  (xiii)  requiring  NGO  project  partners  to  have  at  least  50%  women  field  staff.  A \ngender action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n \n74. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  indicated  that  the  mountainous  terrain \nand high-intensity rainfall during the monsoon coupled with high population pressure from both \nhumans  and  livestock  lead  to  land  degradation  in  the  midhills  in  the  form  of  soil  loss  from \nslopes,  landslides,  and  erosion.  None  of  the  surveyed  households  had  any  waste  treatment \nsystem, nor had they any precise understanding of the effects of a degraded environment. The \nProject  will  promote  stall-feeding  or  tethered  systems  for  larger  animals  and  semi-scavenging \nand stall-feeding systems for goats. The by-products from these enterprises will be recycled as \ncrop  fertilizer,  or  used  as  domestic  fuel.  Growing  of  fodder  trees  also  contributes  fuelwood, \nwhich  significantly  reduces  pressure  on  forests.  The  Project  will  facilitate  funding  for  biogas \ndigesters  to  reduce  dependence  on  burning  dung  for  fuel.  The  environmental  impacts  of  the \nproduction activities are expected to be insignificant. The NGO and farmer training programs will \ninclude  education  on  environmental  responsibilities  and  management  to  develop  community \nconsciousness of environmental issues that will extend beyond the life of the Project, including \nthe  need  to  preserve  existing  biodiversity.  The  design  of  markets,  slaughter  slabs,  and  milk \ntreatment  facilities  will  include  effective  and  environmentally  sound  waste  and  water  disposal \nsystems, with adequate budget to construct the required environmental protection facilities. The \nproject enterprise activities are expected to have minimal adverse impact on the environment; \n\n\f 18\n\ntherefore MFIs do not need to apply an environmental management system. However, DLS will \nconstitute  an  IEE  team  to  screen  processing  and  marketing  subprojects,  and  prepare  reports \nrequired  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  forage  and  fodder  tree  development  and  project \ntraining  programs  will  significantly  assist  in  developing  better  environment  management \npractices in rural areas. A summary IEE is in Appendix 12.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n \nThe recent resumption of armed conflict and instability represent a project risk. The eight \n75. \nnew  project  districts  have  been  among  the  worst  affected  and  are  active  sites  for  conflict. \nHowever,  because  the  insurgents  view  livestock  projects  as  highly  pro-poor,  they  allowed  the \nTLDP  to  continue  to  operate  in  areas  where  they  had  a  strong  presence.    This  acceptance  is \nexpected to prevail in new CLDP districts. \n \n76. \nThe  commitment  of  MOAC  through  DLS  to  the  Project  and  the  project  approach \n(community based and using a participatory, learning approach) is vital. Both MOAC and DLS \nhave demonstrated a strong sense of ownership and support in preparing CLDP, as evidenced \nby  their  preparation  of  the  prefeasibility  study  in  2002.  MOAC  is  also  committed  to  further \nsectoral  reform  and  has  prepared  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  address  policy  issues  such  as \nfurther  reform  of  the  Dairy  Development  Corporation.  The  risk  of  a  lack  of  commitment  is \nconsidered very small. \n \n77. \nThe  project  design  relies  heavily  on  participating  NGOs  entering  into  partnership \narrangements with DLS and DDCs, and correctly interpreting the project\u2019s goals and objectives. \nThe  dialogue  on  participatory  planning  and  the  systems  learning  approach  between  the  PMU \nand  the  participating  NGOs  during  project  implementation  minimizes  this  risk.  The  implicit \nassumption  is  that  participating  NGO  program  organizers  and  program  assistants  will  be \ncapable  of  training  a  wide  range  of  beneficiaries  after  their  own  training.  The  risk  of  this  not \nhappening  is  mitigated  by  attention  to  curricula  development,  training  supervision,  and  post-\ntraining impact evaluation by the PMU. \n \n78. \nNGOs  have  a  proven  performance  in  timely  and  efficient  project  delivery.  The  new \nproject area is a natural expansion of the TLDP project area and much of the infrastructure and \nsystems  established  under  the  TLDP  can  be  used  by  the  new  Project.  However,  because  the \ntrend  in  all  sectors  is  to  utilize  the  strengths  of  local  NGOs,  there  is  the  possibility  of \noverstretching the capacity of the NGOs.  The pressure on NGOs to participate and to perform \nis  a  risk,  but  it  is  manageable,  given  the  training  and  strengthening  of  capacity  under  the \nProject. \n \n79. \nThe  Project\u2019s  participatory  planning  approach  will  allow  flexibility  in  the  selection  of \nenterprises  by  the  participating  beneficiaries  and  ensure  that  the  individual  makes  the  best \npossible  choice  of  enterprise.  Also,  this  feature  will  allow  participants  to  move  away  from \ninvestment  areas  that  become  unprofitable  or  distorted  by  externalities  such  as  unfair  trade \npractices. Favorable product prices are required to provide farmers with the expected financial \nbenefits. The price assumptions used in the financial and economic analyses are conservative, \nand  experience  in  the  TLDP  indicates  that  the  risk  of  adverse  producer  prices  is  minimal,  as \nmost of the products are consumed or marketed locally, with little outside competition at lower \nprices.  Also,  the  low  (but  growing)  consumption  levels  of  livestock  products  in  urban  areas  of \nNepal indicate that household consumption and local market demand will readily dispose of the \nProject\u2019s incremental output without a significant adverse impact on producer prices. The risk of \nlivestock  diseases  will  be  mitigated  by  the  increased  use  of  vaccines  supplied  by  the  private \n\n\f  19\n\nsector,  CLAs  and  para-veterinarians  to  vaccinate  animals,  and  improved  district-level  DLS \ndisease diagnostic services. \n \n80. \nThe  devolution  process  lacks  clarity,  and  new  roles  and  relationships  between  line \nagencies and DDCs are required at the district level. MOAC has a devolution plan that includes \ndeputation  of  staff  and  allocation  of  funds  for  district-level  activities  to  the  district.  The  Project \nwill  be  implemented  according  to  these  guidelines.  However,  few  districts  have  either  the \ncapability  or  the  confidence  to  implement  these  technical  programs,  and  the  responsibility  is \nreassigned to DLS district level staff. Beginning in four districts and extending progressively to \nothers, the Project will work on a pilot basis to develop the capacity and capability of DDC staff \nto  integrate  the  activities  of  LATs  (district  and  village  levels)  into  those  of  the  DDC,  and  to \ndevelop close and harmonious working relationships among all stakeholders at that level. The \nrisk is that (i) livestock development may either not be accorded high priority in the district plan, \nor  be  neglected  by  the  volume  of  activity  from  other  sectors,  overtaxing  the  underdeveloped \ncapacities  and  resources  at  district  level;  and  (ii)  undue  deferment  of  elections  will  affect  the \nbottom  up  and  participatory  approach  of  the  Project.  The  risk  is  considered  to  be  low  in  both \ncases, and is manageable through the participatory processes employed by the Project. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n81. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nWithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  RMDC  will  (a)  designate  MFIs  and \nparticipating banks, satisfactory to ADB, to deliver and manage the microfinance \nactivities  and  training  activities  in  the  livestock  production  and  enterprise \ndevelopment  components;  and  (b)  enter  with  the  MFIs  into  agreements, \nsatisfactory to ADB, to  document the flow, accountability, and repayment of the \nmicrofinance activities. \nThe Government will ensure that funds provided under the TLDP for onlending to \nMFIs  continue  to  be  used  for  livestock  loans  to  farmers,  including  potential \nbeneficiaries of the CLDP. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  approved  annual  development  program \nallocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  required  counterpart \nfunding in accordance with the financing plan. \nThe  Government,  through  DLS,  will  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  duly \nconsidered  in  project  implementation,  with  respect  to  both  project  beneficiaries \nand  staff  recruited  by  DLS  and  participating  NGOs,  in  accordance  with  the \nProject\u2019s gender action plan. \nDLS will ensure that the participating NGOs provide social development training, \nincluding  awareness  raising,  group  management,  legal  literacy,  governance, \nhealth, and hygiene. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  prohibiting  child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, and a clause specifying equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \nIf involuntary resettlement and land or asset acquisition are required for livestock \nmarket  construction,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared.  DLS  will  publicly \n\n\f 20\n\ndisclose  the  resettlement  plan.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, and will include a complete \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses.  DLS  will  not  award  any  civil  works  contract  for \nany  market  improvements  unless  a  resettlement  plan,  in  form  and  substance \nacceptable to ADB, has been submitted to and approved by DLS, the PMU, and \nADB. Land acquisition work including compensation payments will be completed \nbefore possession of land and other assets, in accordance with the agreed-upon \nresettlement plan. \n\n(viii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  conduct  initial  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation-\nmonitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. The data will include income \nand  expenditure  data,  demographic  trends,  gender  issues,  issues  of  ethnic  and \nminority groups, nutritional status, child labor, and environmental issues.  \n Within  1  year  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  implemented \nthe  time-bound  action  plan  prepared  before  loan  negotiations  to  address  the \nissues raised in para. 14, and will regularly review progress with ADB. \nThe Government will require 35% women\u2019s participation in mixed farmer groups \nand  in  beneficiary  level  training  activities,  and  will  implement  the  gender  action \nplan in Appendix 11.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n82. \n\nThe following are conditions for loan effectiveness.  \n\n \n\n \n\nA subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to ADB, between the Government and \nRMDC for microfinance activities will have been executed and become effective \n(subject to the effectiveness of the loan agreement).  \nA first year work plan for the Project will have been prepared and submitted for \nADB approval. \nThe DLS and RMDC will have opened imprest accounts. \nThe Pokhara Milk Supply Scheme will have been privatized. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n83. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  13,969,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Community  Livestock \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTadao Chino \n  President \n\n \n25 November 2003  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1          21 \n\nLIVESTOCK SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nNepal  is  a  rural  country  with  a  population  of  23  million.  Of  the  economically  active \npopulation,  84%  are  engaged  in  subsistence-oriented  agriculture  based  on  crop-livestock,  or \ncrop-livestock-forest  integrated  farming  systems.  Livestock  farming  is  closely  interrelated  with \ncrop production, forest management, management of communal lands, and transportation. Most \nfarmers  keep  livestock,  and  animals  are  an  essential  part  of  rural  landscape  management, \nfarming systems, and the household economy. \n \n2. \nThe  contribution  of  the  livestock  sector  to  the  agricultural  gross  domestic  product  is \nestimated to be 31% and is expected to increase to 45% toward the latter part of the Agriculture \nPerspective Plan period. Dairy is the most important livestock component, contributing 62.7% of \nthe  livestock  share  in  the  agricultural  gross  domestic  product,  followed  by  meat  (32.4%)  and \neggs  (5.0%).  Livestock  exports  (animals  and  products)  are  0.2%  of  total  exports  and  1.1%  of \ntotal imports, and 11.4% and 6.1% of agricultural sector exports and imports, respectively. \n \nThe  livestock  subsector  recorded  healthy  annual  growth  during  the  1990s,  averaging \n3. \nover 3%, accelerating from 1.6% during the first half of the decade to 3.6% in the second half. It \nis  one  of  the  faster  growing  agricultural  subsectors  and  is  considered  an  important  tool  in \npoverty  reduction,  offering  the  poor  family  nutrition,  income,  asset  development,  and  asset \nbuffering  against  adversity.  However,  its  growth  reflects  a  growing  population's  propensity  to \nkeep  livestock,  rather  than  any  significant  increase  in  livestock  productivity.  Individual  projects \nlead to productivity improvements but they need to be widely replicated nationwide. \n \nLow  animal  productivity  is  associated  with  underfeeding  (by  about  one  third),  poor \n4. \ngenetic quality in milk- or meat-producing animals, low levels of management, and inadequate \nextension  services  (animal  health,  animal  husbandry,  feeding,  and  agribusiness).  Where \nfarmers  are  supplied  with  necessary  services,  increases  in  productivity  do  occur;  however, \nstaffing  and  budgetary  constraints  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  expand  this  effect \nnationwide. The need to develop private sector-based services to work alongside those of the \nGovernment is becoming more urgent. \n \nThe  increasing  rate  of  urbanization  will  result  in  half  of  Nepal\u2019s  population  being \n5. \nurbanized within 25 years. An increasing population and rising urban incomes will significantly \nincrease the demand for milk, meat, and eggs. This demand will place significant pressure on \nfarmers to move from subsistence to more commercialized systems of production. Only half the \nurban requirement for milk and meat is being met by local production at the moment; the rest is \nbeing  imported.  The  Project's  emphasis  on  improving  animal  productivity  recognizes  the \ngrowing pressure on local production and imports. \n \nAs the population grows and available land resources are divided among the population, \n6. \nrural families have increasingly found it difficult to support themselves on a shrinking individual \nshare  of  the  agricultural  base.  Men  are  being  compelled  to  migrate  for  work  to  support  their \nfamilies,  while  women  must  contribute  as  best  they  can  to  family  enterprises  in  rural \nhomesteads. The effect in some areas has been either depopulation of livestock or a reduction \nin  its  performance.  The  need  for  social,  economic,  or  enterprise  education  to  underpin  family \nenterprise  activity  is  of  increasing  importance.  The  community  development  and  capacity \nbuilding component of the Project addresses this issue. \n \n7. \nThe  recent  conflict  in  Nepal  has  affected  everyone  at  village  level  with  destruction  of \ninfrastructure  and  a  reduction  in  employment  and  jobs.  Migration  to  towns  in  search  of \n\n\f22\n\n          Appendix 1 \n\nprotection and services has been significant and some families have been displaced. Economic \ndisparity, political frustration, crisis in governance, justice being denied to the poor, and poverty \nhave contributed to the spread of conflict that has affected western areas in particular. Poverty \nis not only widespread but also deep-rooted, and women and children are especially vulnerable. \nWith the aim of improving incomes and employment, the Project has selected eight of the worst \naffected districts. \n \n8. \nThe  presence  at  Nepal\u2019s  border  of  a  large  market  in  India  represents  an  opportunity \nrather than a threat, providing Nepal can increase the volume and consistency of production by \naggregation  of  individual  producers\u2019  production,  improving  supply  chains  from  producer  to \nconsumer,  and  raising  the  currently  low  standards  of  product  quality.  Positive  trends  in  this \ndirection will start with the livestock processing component of the Project to address quality and \nprocessing improvement.  \n \n9. \nNepal became a signatory to the World Trade Organization in October 2003. To access \nthe  benefits  of  World  Trade  Organization  membership,  overall  investment  in  agriculture, \nincluding  livestock,  will  have  to  improve\u2014better  infrastructure,  improved  animal  productivity, \nimproved financial systems, market information systems, and quality certification. A number of \nchanges  are  required:  (i)  less  dependence  on  imports  of  live  animals  for  slaughter,  and  milk \npowder; (ii) increased exports of higher value semiprocessed products such as dairy products, \nhides, and skins; (iii) improved agroprocessing of domestically produced milk, meat, and fibers, \nand  imported  raw  materials  (such  as  wool  for  carpets);  (iv)  stronger  producer-processor-\nconsumer  supply  chain  linkages;  and  (v)  the  emergence  of  niche  marketing  with  high  value \nadded and brand recognition. The Project addresses each of these issues. \n \n10. \nIt is estimated that during the next decade, the annual milk demand of the urban sector \nwill  grow  by  11.1%.  This  estimate  is  based  on  (i)  trends  in  demand  over  the  last  10  years  for \nprocessed fluid milk, (ii) urban population growth of 5.2% in milk-buying municipalities, and (iii) a \nfamily consumption income elasticity of 1.5%. On this basis, milk production of 1.1 million metric \ntons  in  2001  needs  to  increase  to  3  million  metric  tons  in  2010/11.  This  indicates  that  the \npresent  annual  growth  rate  in  milk  production  must  increase  from  around  3%  to  17%  (when \nimports are excluded) to meet the demand of larger urban centers.  \n \n11.  While the growing demand for milk and milk products in urban areas is not matched by \nlocal  production  growth,  the  formal  milk  market  is  complicated  by  government  involvement  in \nmilk  processing  and  pricing.  Privatization  of,  or  at  least  price  deregulation  by,  the  Dairy \nDevelopment  Corporation  is  a  reform  that  would  open  the  market  to  further  private  sector \ninvestment. The seasonal surpluses of milk occurring after the wet season could be addressed \nby  allowing  supply  and  demand  to  establish  the  producer  milk  price.  These  issues  and  the \npersistent problems with milk quality are being addressed through a time-bound action plan for \nthe Government to deal with the Dairy Development Corporation and pricing issues; and training \nprograms for farmers, collectors, and processors in the marketing chain. \n \n12. \nAnnual  per  capita  consumption  of  meat  in  Nepal  is  about  8  kilograms,  but  urban \nconsumption  exceeds  10  kilograms.  The  annual  increase  in  total  demand  for  meat  has  been \nestimated at 2.2% during the 1990s, which is roughly equivalent to the increase in population. \nAnnual  growth  in  domestic  production  of  meat  over  the  same  period  has  been  estimated  at \n1.9%.  The  growth  in  meat  consumption  is  caused  by  rapid  urbanization  and  associated \nincreases in income. There is a growing gap between supply and demand. It is estimated1 that \n\n                                                 \n1 Agriculture Perspective Plan. \n\n\fAppendix 1          23 \n\ntechnical  and \n\nfinancial  plans \n\nnational  meat  demand  will  reach  453,000  metric  tons  in  2010,  whereas  the  present  level  of \nproduction is below 200,000 metric tons.  \n \n13.  While  the  demand  for  livestock  products  from  major  urban  centers  will  exceed  supply \nwell  into  the  future,  the  consumption  of  products  in  rural  areas  and  secondary  towns  also \nrequires attention. Because many secondary towns have insufficient supplies of milk and meat \nproduct prices in such localities are very high. The Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP) \ninitiated  a  strategy  of  processing  and  marketing  products  in  smaller  district  towns  (secondary \ntowns)  to  develop  local  capability  and  to  generate  local  employment.  Four  principles  were \napplied  in  promoting  small-scale  processing:  (i)  promoting  of  public-private  partnerships,  (ii) \nassisting  entrepreneurs  with  preparing \nto  establish \nmicroenterprises  suited  to  local  conditions,  (iii)  promoting  the  use  of  locally  manufactured \nin  product  development  delivered  by \ntraining \nequipment,  and  (iv)  practical  hands-on \nexperienced trainers. The Project will continue with this approach. \n \n14. \nThe  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS)  is  constrained  by  (i)  staffing  restrictions \nthat  have  led  to  the  use  of  alternative  approaches  to  address  farming  communities\u2019  needs \nthrough groups, with the active collaboration of local nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (ii) \nlow morale of DLS staff resulting in poor performance that can be improved through in-service \ntraining and more effective supervision; and (iii) a supply-driven as opposed to an output- and \ndemand-driven  approach.  However,  the  use  of  farmer  groups  as  a  focus  for  extension  and \ncredit delivery, facilitated by NGOs, has led to significantly lower farmer transaction costs, and \nan  increase  in  the  impact  of  services  delivered  to  farmers  in  the  TLDP.  Until  the  alternative \napproaches  introduced  in  the  TLDP  are  fully  adopted  nationwide,  there  is  little  likelihood  that \nDLS can be fully responsive to the needs of farming communities, or have programs tailored to \nthe  characteristics  and  potentials  of  a  district.  Such  changes  will  take  time,  and  will  be \nsupported by the Project.  DLS also has poor monitoring and evaluation capability that will be \nimproved under the Project.  \n \n15.  Microfinance \nfrom  several  sources\u2014banks  as  well  as \nmicrofinance  intermediaries  that  are  accredited  to  and  monitored  by  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank. \nAccess  to  credit  from  commercial  banks  is  limited  to  wealthier  people,  because  the  rural  poor \nlack  the  required  collateral,  have  difficulty  in  understanding  and  negotiating  the  application \nprocess, and live far from bank branches. Gender equity has also been an ignored issue in the \nbanking sector. While women take most of the responsibility for livestock production, they lack \nproperty rights and are therefore unable to take loans because they cannot meet loan collateral \nrequirements. They are also not in the commercial banks\u2019 priority lending agenda. As with the \nTLDP, the Project intends to work through microfinance intermediaries that operate locally bring \nmicrofinance  services  to  the  door  of  the  farmer,  and  advance  microfinance  on  a  group \nguarantee  basis,  particularly  to  women.  As  with  the  case  of  delivery  of  extension  advice  to \nfarmers (para. 14), this approach leads to significantly lower borrower transaction costs, and far \nimproved service delivery to poor farm families. A subsector road map is in Table A1. \n \n16. \nThe  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Center  (RMDC)  was  registered  on  30  October \n1998  as  a  public  limited  company  under  the  Companies  Act  of  1996,  to  act  as  an  apex \nmicrofinance  development  bank  within  the  framework  of  the  Development  Bank  Act  of  1995. \nRMDC,  created  with  the  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  through  the  Rural \nMicrofinance  Project,  operates  as  a  wholesale  lender  to  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  rural \ndevelopment  banks,  microfinance  development  banks,  rural  cooperatives,  and  NGO  financial \nintermediaries  that  are  providing  microfinance  services  to  the  poor,  the  marginalized,  and  the \ndeprived,  with  the  main  focus  being  on  women  living  below  the  poverty  line.  RMDC  therefore \n\nis  coming \n\nlivestock \n\nfor \n\n\f24\n\n          Appendix 1 \n\nmeets the subsector needs identified in para. 15. The primary objective of RMDC is to provide \nmicrofinance facilities through MFIs to poor rural households, particularly women, to undertake \nviable farm  and off-farm economic activities, thereby improving their quality of life. In addition, \nRMDC seeks to promote and develop sustainable MFIs through expansion of outreach efforts to \nsupport capacity building and institutional strengthening. It also aims to improve and sustain the \nperformance standards of partner MFIs and conduct performance monitoring and supervision of \npartner  MFIs.  RMDC\u2019s  performance  under  the  Rural  Microfinance  Project  has  been  highly \nsatisfactory, as it trained MFIs and expanded the number of partner MFIs. RMDC has prepared \nan  action  plan  to  continue  to  expand  the  number  of  its  partner  organizations  in  the  proposed \nproject area over the next year, to ensure that there is sufficient MFI coverage to meet farmers\u2019 \ndemands  for  microfinance.  It  will  also  ensure  that  newer  MFIs  receive  the  required  training  to \neffectively deliver microfinance to farmers. \n \n\n\fAppendix 1         25  \n\nTable A1:  Sector Road Map \n

Implementation plans will evolve in response to local \nneeds  and  priorities  identified  through  active  community  participation,  while  implementation \npace  will  be  linked  to  the  rate  of  development  of  increased  capacities  at  local  level.  The \nprinciples observed in the project design include (i) a market, demand-led approach; (ii) gender \nmainstreaming  in  all  components;  (iii)  public-private  partnership  arrangements  to  utilize  the \nrespective strengths and resources of the public sector (the Department of Livestock Services \n[DLS]) as Executing Agency, and associated line agencies), the private sector (nongovenment \norganizations  [NGOs],  the  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Center  [RMDC]  as  executing \nagency,  community-based  organizations  [CBOs],  entrepreneurs,  microfinance  intermediaries \n[MFIs],  private  sector  associations,  and  farmers);  (iv)  project  management  flexibility  based  on \nrelevant monitoring of data from all stakeholders; and (v) accommodation of the Government's \nrequirements for decentralization by improving district authorities\u2019 capacity to implement district-\nlevel activities.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  the  development  of  profitable  and  sustainable  livestock \nenterprises  and  has  two  key  elements:  (i)  intensive  livestock  production;  and  (ii)  processing, \nmarketing, and commercialization of livestock subsector services. A livelihoods pilot program for \nfive  higher-altitude  districts  is  to  be  formulated  during  the  first  2  years  of  the  Project,  and \nimplemented during the last 4 years.  \n \nIntensive  livestock  production  will  be  conducted  in  22  districts  of  the  three  western \n3. \nregions  of  Nepal.  District  selection  is  based  on  criteria  similar  to  those  in  the  Third  Livestock \nDevelopment  Project  (TLDP):  (i)  incidence  and  nature  of  poverty,  and  the  way  in  which  the \nProject can assist poor communities (women and disadvantaged groups); (ii) existing livestock \npopulation  (types,  density,  production,  and  potential  for  fodder  and  productivity  improvement); \n(iii)  level  of  farmer  interest;  and  (iv)  level  of  knowledge  and  experience  that  can  contribute  to \ndevelopment in the district. The existence of markets, DLS infrastructure, and the presence of \nother  project  activities  were  other  factors  considered.  The  intensive  livestock  production  area \ncomprises the following districts:  \n \n\nRegion \nLeader districts (4) \n\nWestern \n\nMidwestern \n\nFar Western \n\n \n\n \n\nLamjung, \nTanahu, \nNawalparasi, \nPalpa \nBaglung,  Gulmi, \nArghakhanchi \n\nConsolidation districts \n(10) (less than 3 years \nunder TLDP) \n\nNew districts (8) \n\n \n\nBanke, Bardiya, \nSurkhet  \n\nPyuthan, Rolpa, \nSalyan, Rukum, \nDailekh, Jajarkot \n\nKailali, \nKanchanpur, \nDandeldhura, \nDoti \nBaitadi, Achham, \n\n \n \n4. \nProcessing,  marketing,  and  commercialization  activities  will  be  conducted  in  22  mainly \nplains  districts  of  the  Central  and  Eastern  regions,  and  potential  areas  in  the  22  intensive \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n          Appendix 4 \n\nlivestock  production  districts  in  the  three  western  regions.1  The  criteria  used  for  selecting \nintensive  livestock  production  districts  also apply  to  the  selection  of  processing and  marketing \ndistricts, coupled with other factors such as the presence of consumers with purchasing power, \nthe presence of traders and other market players, linkages with other and larger markets, and \nthe  existence  of  marketable  surpluses.  Production  has  previously  been  stimulated  in  these \ndistricts,  and  there  are  sizable  imports  of  live  animals  in  these  areas  that  can  be  further \nprocessed  before  marketing  in  urban  centers.  Production  surpluses  from  the  22  intensive \nlivestock  production  districts  will  be  processed  by  promoting  processing,  marketing  and \ncommercialization  developments  in  appropriate  districts  in  the  three  western  development \nregions.   Identifying demand centers with populations of 50,000 (medium potential) to 200,000 \nor more (high potential) was another key consideration. \n \nThe  livelihoods  pilot  program  for  higher  altitudes  will  use  a  multisector  approach \n5. \ndeveloped  for  the  remote  districts  of  Darchula,  Jumla,  Mugu,  Humla,  and  Bajhang.  The \nselection  criteria  included  (i)  north-south  transhumance  linkages  connecting  to  the  intensive \nproduction  districts  mentioned  (para.  3),  (ii)  potential \nimprovement,  (iii) \nopportunities for rangeland improvement, (iv) potential for markets, and (v) potential for linkages \nwith other sectors (forestry, tourism, irrigation, and horticulture). \n \n \n\nlivestock \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1  The  22  processing  and  marketing  districts  are  Bara,  Chitwan,  Dang,  Dhanusa,  Jhapa,  Kapilbastu,  Kaski, \nKathmandu, Kavre Palanchowk, Lalitpur, Mahotari, Makwanpur, Morang, Nawalparasi, Nuwakot, Parsa, Rautahat, \nRupandehi, Saptari, Sarlahi, Siraha, and Sunsari. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5           37 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1:  Project Cost Summary, by Componenta \n\n \n \n \n    Item\n\n1.

Other critical areas in which DLS has either no capacity or only a limited capacity include \n(i) facilitating the delivery of microfinance to the rural poor through microfinance intermediaries; \n(ii)  establishing  input-  output-based  monitoring  systems  at  community,  district,  and  central \nlevels;  (iii)  forage  development  and  seed  production;  (iv)  managing  project  training  packages; \nand  (v)  mainstreaming  gender  in  community  livestock  development  processes.  The  overall \nleadership and coordination of this support will be critical to the effective implementation of the \nProject.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  provide  531  person-months  of  consulting  services  in  two  packages  (A \nand B) for training, guiding process-related activities, technical support, privatizing the delivery \nof  farmer  services  and  inputs,  and  marketing  and  agroprocessing.  International  (67  person-\nmonths) and domestic (464 person-months) consultants will be fielded to support the identified \nbeneficiaries, the desired technology transfer, and change in approach. The terms of reference \nof the two groups are in para. 3. \n \nInternational  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  design,  application,  and  initial \n3. \nmanagement  of  the  participatory  process  and  associated  training  and  extension  activities, \nincluding forage and seed development. Expertise will also be required to assist in establishing \nand  managing  agribusinesses  (meat  and  milk),  and  promoting  privatization  of  veterinary \nservices. The international specialists will also provide specific technical and training support in \nestablishing  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  within  the  DLS  network,  designing  abattoir \nfacilities,  and  improving  the  quality  of  dairy  and  meat  products.  The  domestic  consultants  will \nsupport  the  participatory  process  and  training  programs;  the  delivery  of  rural  microfinance, \nincluding  the  development  of  group  savings  and  credit;  expansion  of  forage,  and  private \nveterinary  practices;  further  development  of  dairy  and  meat  processing  and  marketing;  live \nanimal  marketing;  and  technical  design.  Domestic  consultants  will  also  provide  support  in \nestablishing  a  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  at  central,  district  and  beneficiary \nlevels;  mainstreaming  gender  in  livestock  development;  assessing  environmental  impact;  and \nadministering the Project. \n \n4. \nThe technical assistance is in two parts. Part A comprises core positions that are critical \nto the success of the Project. Part B comprises indicative positions that are a best estimate of \nfuture project requirements and are subject to change based on implementation experience and \nchanging requirements. This approach was adopted in the Third Livestock Development Project \nto allow flexible implementation for effective use of the technical inputs. \n \n5. \nPackage  A  consultants  (49  person-months  international  consulting  services  and  368 \nperson-months domestic) will be funded under grant assistance if this can be obtained at a later \nstage.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  Government  and  will  provide  overall  team \nleadership  and  advice  in  implementing  the  Project.  Package  B  consultants  (up  to  18  person-\nmonths international consulting services and up to 96 person-months domestic) will be funded \nfrom  the  loan  administered  by  the  Borrower.  The  Borrower  will  recruit  the  consultants  through \nfirms selected in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.   \n \n\n \n\n\f42            Appendix 8 \n \n\nA. \n\nPackage A Consultants \n\n \n\ntechnical  services, \n\nEleven individual consultants will be required as core staff.

More  than  80%  of  the  economically  active  population  is  engaged  in  crop-livestock- \nforest  integrated  farming  systems.    A  significant  proportion  of  small  farmers  and  the  landless \nkeep a higher proportion of livestock.  Livestock plays a vital role in food security for the poor: it \nis the only source of high value protein in the diet and provides 20% of total household income \nin the hills. \n\n2. \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  the  poverty  of  farm  families  in  the  western \ndistricts  of  Nepal.  Recent  poverty  assessments  show  that  poverty  incidence  and  severity  are \ngreatest  in  the  west.  The  existing  farming  system  suffers  from  low  animal  productivity, \ninadequate access to effective extension services, lack of affordable credit, and limited market \nopportunities.  With the Project, impacts will derive from separate but closely linked sources\u2014a \ntechnical response to improved extension and animal health services and a financial response \nfrom access to affordable investment credit. Market distortions will also be addressed through a \nprogressive reduction of government controls and promotion of community and private sector-\nled  interventions\u2014improved  service  delivery,  better  hygiene  standards  and  quality  control\u2014at \nthe level of both input supplies and availability of processed products.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n3. \nThe Project will have a direct impact on the lives of 69,000 beneficiary smallholder farm \nfamilies  in  690  production  pockets.  In  addition,  the  wider  rural  economy  will  benefit  through \nenhanced  food  production  and  additional  employment  opportunities.  Investment  in  livestock \nprocessing  and  marketing  enterprises  will  provide  employment  and  expanded  trading \nopportunities for about 95,000 households. Cash incomes will increase and food insecurity will \nbe  significantly  reduced.  Farmers  will  benefit  from  access  to  improved  livestock  extension \nservices, which will result in improved and sustainable productivity. Project impacts will be the \nresult  of  a  combination  of  social  preparation,  improved  feeding,  animal  health,  extension \nservices, and access to microfinance.  \n \n \n \n4. \nThe  output  from  the  Project  will  comprise  milk,  meat,  and  eggs.  The  linkages  between \nproduction and marketing will be improved by promoting local processing and marketing. Eggs \nand milk will generally be sold in the local area. Live animals are likely to be consumed locally, \nor sold to livestock traders.   \n \n5. \nThe  formal  milk  collection  system  initiated  by  the  Dairy  Development  Corporation,  and \nnow  including  private  sector  entrepreneurs,  has  been  effective  in  collecting  milk  from  a  wide \narea for sale in Kathmandu and other major towns (accounting, however, for only 10% of total \nmilk production). Experience in implementing the Third Livestock Development Project (TLDP) \nhas  shown  that  secondary  towns  are  a  ready  market  for  milk  and  milk  products.  It  has  also \ndemonstrated  that  small  dairies  with  low-cost  technology  are  financially  viable  and  create \nemployment. It is estimated that during the next decade, the annual milk demand from the urban \nsector  will  grow  by  11%.  The  Project  will  follow  the  TLDP  approach  of  promoting  local \nprocessing  and  marketing,  with  emphasis  on  traditional  dairy  product  diversification.  Meat \nconsumption  is  increasing  because  of  urbanization  and  rising  incomes,  but  there  is  a  growing \ngap between supply and demand. It is estimated that national meat demand will reach 453,000 \nmetric tons in 2010, whereas the present level of production is below 200,000 metric tons, only \n\n \n\n\f44            Appendix 9 \n \n\n50% of the total demand. The increasing gap is currently being filled by importing animals from \nTibet and India and meat from overseas. On average, 150,000 head of buffalo, 300,000 goats, \nand 46,000 head of pigs are imported annually from India. The production of goats and buffalo \nunder  the  Project  will  meet  a  ready  market  within  Nepal.  Specialist  private  sector  producers, \nparticularly  in  the  Central  Region,  produce  broiler  chickens  and  eggs.  There  are  only  a  few \ncommercial  operations  in  the  22  intensive  livestock  production  districts  in  the  three  western \nregions, and the demand for chicken and eggs is mainly met from imports. Incremental project \nproduction  will  primarily  be  consumed  within  the  household,  or  sold  locally.  The  Project  will \npromote  commercial  poultry  operations  only  in  peri-urban  areas  to  meet  the  growing  urban \ndemand for eggs and chicken.  \n \n \n\nSector Policy Context \n\n2. \n\n \n\nApproach and Methodology \n\n6. \nCurrently, the increasing urban demand for milk and milk products is met by imports of \nmilk powder and milk products. In 2000/01 12,568 metric tons of dairy products were imported. \nThe import volume, with a liquid milk equivalent of 100-120 million liters of milk, was similar to \nthe  volume  of  locally  processed  milk  currently  marketed  by  the  formal  sector  in  Nepal.    Local \nproduction  capacity  is  not  presently  able  to  meet  the  rising  demand  for  milk.  Poor  quality \nsubsidized skim milk powder, and milk (55,000 liters per day) from India are meeting the local \nproduction deficit  of  60%.  The  demand  for  processed  milk  in  Nepal  is  estimated  at  0.5  million \nliters per day against the local production of 0.2 million liters. The Project addresses this market \ndistortion  through  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  to  deregulate  milk  pricing,  which  is \ninfluenced by the Dairy Development Corporation\u2019s market operations. Related reforms include \nenforcing  legislation  pertaining  to  meat  and  animal  feed  quality,  and  removing  tax  and  duty \ndistortions  in  the  livestock  industry.  Reorientation  of  the  Department  of  Livestock  Services  is \nalso envisaged to strengthen its capability in community development and extension, monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  market  surveillance.  Additionally,  private  sector  institutions  will  be \nsupported to take responsibility for quality assurance.   \n \nB. \n \n7. \nTo  determine  the  expected  direct  benefits  of  project  livestock  enterprises,  where \nappropriate,  quantifiable  effects  are  valued  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios.  Many  enterprises  will  be  entirely  new  to  farmers,  in  which  case  all  benefits  are \nregarded  as  incremental.  In  addition  to  the  quantifiable  benefits  and  costs  included  in  the \nanalysis,  the  Project  can  have  nonquantifiable  effects.  Community  mobilization,  for  example, \ncan result in women acquiring skills and confidence to participate more actively in village affairs. \nThe increase in farm household incomes and improved food security will also result in improved \nnutrition and health status among the target beneficiaries.  \n \nPrices and data used in the analysis were obtained from a variety of secondary sources, \n8. \nfarmer  interviews,  and  TLDP  monitoring  data.  Assumptions  used  in  the  economic  analysis \nfollow: (i) import parity pricing for milk products is used; (ii) border pricing is used for buffalo and \ngoat  meat;  (iii)  values  are  expressed  in  constant  2003  prices  to  exclude  inflation;  (iv)  an \nexchange rate of NRs76/$1 is used; (v) for nontraded goods and services, specific conversion \nfactors were estimated, with a shadow wage rate of 0.53 for unskilled labor, consistent with that \nin recent projects in Nepal; (vi) for major tradable commodities, economic values were based on \nborder parity pricing; and (vii) transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies were excluded in \ncalculating economic values.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9 \n\n45\n\n1. \n\nLivestock Enterprise Development \n\n \n9. \nA  representative  selection  of  15  livestock  enterprises  was  analyzed  (Table  A9.1). \nSituations  at  full  development  were  used  in  calculating  financial  and  economic  gross  margins. \nInvestment  costs  for  each  enterprise  were  assessed,  including  the  level  of  beneficiary \ncontribution (labor or materials). Particular attention was paid to establishing the enterprise cash \nflow  (after  financing)  to  demonstrate  the  time  required  for  the  farmer  to  repay  loans,  and \naccumulate working capital to fund ongoing operations from equity. In addition, the financial and \neconomic internal rates of return (FIRR and EIRR) were calculated for each livestock enterprise. \nAs a result of the approach of offering farmers a range of enterprise choices, adoption rates by \nfarmers  of  individual  enterprises  could  not  be  assessed  with  any  degree  of  accuracy.  The \nvariable response of individual adopting farmers was addressed by adopting prudent production \nparameters.  All  enterprises  are  financially  and  economically  viable.  It  is  expected  that  about \n50%  of  the  project  loans  will  be  for  goat  production  undertaken  by  women.  This  enterprise  is \nfinancially and economically viable.   \n \n\n  \n\nTable A9.1: Analysis of Livestock Enterprises \n\n \n\nScale \n\nEnterprise Margin \n$ \nFinancial  Economic \n\nIncremental  Incrementala\n\nLabor \n\nBenefit \n\n  \n\n(NRs/day) \n\n1 Village Egg/Chick Farmer \n\n9 layers \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNo. \n\nEnterprise \n\n2 Broiler Production \n3 Feed Mixer \n4 Hill Goat Herd \n5 Stall-Fed Goat Herd \n6 Buffalo Cow \u2013 Milk \n7 Buffalo Cow \u2013 Ghee \n\n300 birds \n180 t/yr \n3 does \n3 does \n2 head \n2 head \n\n2 calves \n\n256 \n\n270 \n751 \n112 \n203 \n532 \n523 \n\n120 \n\n128 \n\n8 Buffalo Meat Production \n\n9 Buffalo Cow with Calf \n\n1 buffalo cow \n\n10 Rear Heifer Calf \n11 Breeding Sow \n12 Fattening Piglets \n13 Forage Replacing Cereal  \n14 Forage \u2013 Wasteland \n15 Forage \u2013 Seed Producer \nha = hectare, t/yr = ton per year \na Incremental benefits are indicated for existing enterprises only. \nSource:   Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2 calves \n1 sow \n2 piglets \n0.1 ha \n0.05 ha \n0.1 ha \n\n75 \n170 \n142 \n50 \n34 \n50 \n\n160 \n\n183 \n1102 \n128 \n206 \n356 \n372 \n\n59 \n\n51 \n\n34 \n150 \n132 \n22 \n24 \n18 \n\n132 \n\n319 \n160 \n222 \n745 \n302 \n397 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n43 \n36 \n30 \n11 \n7 \n11 \n\n($) \n\n104 \n\n270 \n330 \n110 \n96 \n273 \n259 \n\n120 \n\n128 \n\n75 \n51 \n51 \n10 \n24 \n8 \n\n \n10. \nEIRR  and  FIRR  sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  all  enterprises  are  still  viable  after  a \n10% increase in costs, or a 10% decrease in income.

The major impact of \nthe  Project  would  be  to  increase  household  incomes  and  provide  better  family  nutrition.  The \nProject will also promote stall-feeding of animals, which will result in improved crop production \nbecause  of  the  increased  availability  of  manure,  and  environmental  benefits  resulting  from \nincreased  forage  production.  Additional  increments  to  household  income  will  also  result  from \nmore  efficient  labor  use.  Given  the  degree  of  unemployment  and  underemployment  that  is \ntypical  of  the  districts  of  western  Nepal,  in  financial  terms  this  improved  return  to  labor \n(measured as returns per day) will add substantially to household income, particularly to that of \nthe  poor.  The  project  impacts  will  be  generated  from  separate  but  closely  linked  sources\u2014a \ntechnical response to improved technology such as better forage, animal husbandry, and animal \nhealth services; and a financial response from access to affordable microfinance.  \n \n12. \nAdditional employment opportunities are assessed for each enterprise. Replacing forage \ngathering from the forests (taking most of each day) with forage plots next to the home will give \nsignificant  labor  savings  for  women.  On  average  across  all  enterprises,  female  labor  demand \nwill fall by 13%, and male labor demand will rise by 19%. Given that female labor accounts for \naround 80% of the total livestock enterprise labor inputs, the savings are significant. Women will \nbe  able  to  use  the  time  saved  from  gathering  forage  to  invest  in  new  cash-earning  activities \nsuch  as  calf  rearing  and  commercial  forage  production.  While  incremental  daily  returns  from \nsome  enterprises  are  not  great,  nonetheless  they  provide  an  opportunity  to  earn  incremental \nincome, instead of the existing situation of high labor demand on women to support enterprises \ngenerating  low  income.  Returns  to  daily  labor  will  also  increase;  on  average  the  incremental \nreturn to labor from the representative enterprises will increase to $2.25 from the current $0.79 \nper day.1 With a high proportion of labor being female labor, this represents a 190% increase on \nthe current daily labor rate for women ($0.77).  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 This calculation does not include new activities. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9 \n\n47\n\n13.  Milk  will  be  marketed  through  1,800  dairy  entrepreneurs  trained  by  the  Project. \nIncremental  production  of  about  8  million  liters  of  milk  per  year  (22,000  liters  per  day)  will  be \nsold in local markets. Given that the TLDP trained 1,200 dairy entrepreneurs, 25% of whom are \ncurrently selling 23,000 liters daily in their local communities, and that the milk production deficit \nis  large,  marketing  the  expected  incremental  milk  production  is  considered  feasible.  The \nexpected  annual  incremental  goat  output  of  56,400  head  represents  only  about  20%  of  the \nofficial  goat  imports  from  India.  The  expected  annual  incremental  butter  (ghee)  production  of \n500  tons  has  a  ready  export  market  in  India.  Incremental  production  of  other  products  will  be \nconsumed within the project districts, which have a population of 2.4  million households. Given \nthe  low  but  rising  per  capita  consumption  of  livestock  products  in  Nepal,  this  population  will \nreadily absorb the project outputs. For example, the expected annual incremental output of eggs \nrepresents only 0.5 egg per capita per day. \n \n14. \nThe  cash-flow  analysis  of  each  enterprise  shows  that  the  costs  associated  with \ndevelopment of the enterprise (debt servicing) are affordable. In addition to servicing the debt, \nfarmers  can  then  accumulate  sufficient  capital  to  ensure  that  they  generate  adequate  working \ncapital  within  the  project  life  (with  the  exception  of  milking  buffalo,  which  takes  10  years  to \ngenerate  working  capital).  Given  the  conservative  production  assumptions  of  the  enterprise \nmodels,  financial  sustainability  can  reasonably  be  expected  and  will  financially  empower \nbeneficiary farm families considerably. \n \n\n2. \n\nComparative Advantage \n\n \n15. \nTo  determine  the  viability  of  the  enterprises  competing  with  imports  and  in  view  of \ncurrent  market  distortions  (para.  6),  an  illustrative  analysis  examined  the  viability  of  promoting \ninvestments in livestock enterprises and assessed the comparative advantage of such ventures. \nPolicy  action  matrices  for  broiler  chicken  and  buffalo  milk  production  were  prepared.  Both \nenterprises  demonstrate  competitiveness  under  existing  market  conditions.  In  both  cases,  the \nprivate cost ratio is positive, indicating that the enterprise creates additional value added. The \ndomestic  resource  cost  ratio  is  less  than  1  for  both  enterprises,  indicating  their  sizable \ncomparative advantage. While the effective protection coefficients are greater than 1.0 (broilers \n1.3,  and  milking  buffalo  1.6),  these  are  not  sufficiently  high  to  indicate  that  large  levels  of \ntransfers are occurring.  \n\n3. \n\nCommercial Marketing and Processing Enterprises \n\n \n16. \nAn  important  assumption  underlying  the  project  design  is  that  livestock  enterprises \nundertaken  by  poor  farmers  will  be  sustainable.  A  key  strategy  in  ensuring  sustainability  is  to \nimprove market access and add value through livestock product processing. To implement this \napproach, one project component seeks to improve livestock processing and marketing. Based \non prudent estimates of throughput and turnover, detailed analyses of a representative selection \nof these facilities were undertaken. The results are summarized in Table A9.3. \n\n \n\n\f48            Appendix 9 \n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nLive Animal Market \n\nMilk Chilling Center \n\nMilk Processing Factory \nSlaughter Slaba \nRetail Meat Shopb \nSlaughterhouse \n\nTable A9.3: Analysis of Commercial Enterprises  \n\n \n\nYear 6 Gross \n\nIndicative \n\nUnits \n\nMargin ($) \n\nLoan ($) \n\nEquity \n\nInput ($) \n\n26 \n\n37 \n\n5 \n\n50 \n\n185 \n\n       26,236 \n\n7,009 \n\n2,837 \n\n6,465 \n\n5,366 \n\n5 \n\n       14,502 \n\n  9,750 \n\n  5,274 \n\n12,825 \n\n15,706 \n\n  3,731 \n\n25,310 \n\n  3,053 \n\n2,167 \n\n1,172 \n\n2,850 \n\n3,696 \n\n   878 \n\n5,624 \n\n   679 \n\nPara-Veterinarian \n \n  a Operates on a cost-plus basis for retail butcher partners. \n    b Based on current retail prices. \n\n1,840 \n\n250 \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nThe  live  animal  markets  will  both  improve  buyers\u2019  access  to  livestock  and  introduce \n17. \nlivestock  weighing  facilities  to  ensure  that  buyers  and  sellers  interact  on  an  equally  informed \nbasis. Livestock weighing before sale will empower farmers. Two important market constraints \nfaced  by  farmers,  being  poorly  informed  about  prices  and  weights,  will  be  removed.  Other \ninvestments\u2014milk  chilling  centers,  slaughter  slabs,  and  para-veterinary  services\u2014address \nother  market  failures  by  providing  markets  for  farmers\u2019  incremental  production,  increasing \nemployment opportunities, and supplying quality-oriented livestock services not currently being \nprovided. \n \n18. \nThe project processing and marketing investments are estimated to create about 5,100 \nperson-years of annual employment. In addition to direct job creation, considerable downstream \nemployment  will  be  created  for  input  suppliers,  construction  contractors,  and  others.  It  is \nestimated that in the dairy subsector, every milk-producing farmer creates eight jobs.  \n \n19. \nSensitivity analyses were performed by assuming various scenarios of increased costs \nand  decreased  benefits  (Table  A9.4).  EIRR  sensitivity  analyses  with  increased  direct  costs  or \ndecreased benefits indicate that the enterprises are robust with a 10% increase in direct costs, \nor a 10% decrease in income. However, the FIRR of two enterprises (community slaughter slab \nat 7% and para-veterinary practice at 8%) show some vulnerability to a 10% rise in direct costs. \nAll enterprises remain generally viable with a 10% increase in capital cost. Community slaughter \nslabs, milk chilling centers and para-veterinary practices show some vulnerability to a 10% fall in \nrevenue. Switching values were also calculated. It was observed that the enterprises have the \ncapacity  to  withstand  shocks  of  cost  overruns  and  reduction  in  incremental  income.  Before \nstarting on any investments during implementation, detailed feasibility studies will be conducted \nto ensure that the investments are financially viable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 9 \n\n49\n\nTable A9.4:   Financial and Economic Analyses of Commercial Enterprises \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nEIRR \n(%) \n\nSwitching Values (%) \n\nIncome \nreduction \n\nItem \nLive Animal Market \nMilk Chilling Center \nMilk Processing Factory \nCommunity Slaughter Slab \nRetail Meat Shop \nSlaughterhouse \nPara-Veterinarian \nEIRR = economic internal rate return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n36 \n50 \n21 \n33 \n12 \n29 \n200 \n\n32 \n46 \n43 \n53 \n71 \n29 \n46 \n\nCapital \nCost \nIncrease \n  60 \n210 \n460 \n168 \n500 \n110 \n180 \n\nDirect \nCosts \nOverrun \n  89 \n195 \n  29 \n  70 \n  14 \n500 \n32 \n\n4. \n\nDemand for Credit \n\n \nFIRR \n(%) \n \n17 \n14 \n34 \n14 \n54 \n16 \n15 \n\nDirect \nCost \nOverrun \n27 \n10 \n23 \n  5 \n12 \n10 \n4 \n\nSwitching Values (%) \nIncome \nReduction \n\nCapital \nCost \nIncrease \n  25 \n  16 \n400 \n  10 \n400 \n  40 \n25 \n\n11 \n  5 \n17 \n  3 \n10 \n  7 \n3 \n\n \n20. \nThe Project\u2019s microfinance component provides the rural poor with access to previously \nunavailable  microfinance.  To  facilitate  value  addition,  employment  generation,  and  sustained \nmarket  linkages  with  livestock  production,  credit  will  be  made  available  to  entrepreneurs  for \nestablishing  milk  processing  plants,  milk  chilling  centers,  abattoirs  and  slaughter  slabs,  and \nlivestock markets in livestock commercial centers to cater to the growing needs of the urban and \nsemi-urban  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  livestock  production  loans  for  goat,  buffalo,  cattle, \npig,  poultry,  and  heifer  calf  rearing  in  the  22  intensive  livestock  production  districts.  It  is \nassumed  that  80%  of  the  69,000  households  that  will  be  involved  in  livestock  production \nactivities will require loans. Of these, it is assumed that 50% will purchase goats, 30% buffalo, \n5% buffalo for fattening, 10% commercial and rural poultry, 2% heifer calf for rearing, and 3% \npig for fattening.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\f50            Appendix 10 \n \n\nSUMMARY  POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nYes \n\n \nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?                                  \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty: \nThe livestock subsector contributes 31% to  agricultural gross domestic  product.

Data  on  investment  in  livestock  per  household \nindicates  that  the  poorest  make  higher  investments  than  the  higher  quintiles  (13.2%  of  incomes  for  the  poor  versus \n4.8% for the highest quintile). Livestock plays a vital role in food security for the poor: it is the only source of high-value \nprotein  in  the  diet  and  provides  20%  of  total  household  income  in  the  hills.  The  poorest  allocate  69%  of  total \nexpenditures for food, 16 percentage points more than those in the highest decile.  \n \nNepal's  poverty  ranking  is  142nd  out  of  173  countries,  and  the  human  development  index  of  0.47  is  lower  than  the \nweighted  average  for  South  Asia  (0.57).    A  comparison  of  human  development  index  values  across  the  five \ndevelopment  regions  of  Nepal  highlight  significant  differences  in  human  capabilities.  For  instance,  the  human \ndevelopment indexes of the Mid-Western and Far Western regions at 0.402 and 0.385, respectively, are much lower \nthan  those  of  the  Central  (0.493),  Eastern  (0.484),  and  Western  regions  (0.479).  The  gender-related  development \nindex follows the same pattern, higher in the Central (0.476), Eastern (0.465) and Western (0.463) regions, and lower \nin the Mid-Western (0.376) and Far Western (0.356) regions. \n \nThe  Project  covers  48  districts  in  all  the  five  development  regions  and  focuses  on  two  key  elements  based  on  the \nneeds, resource endowment, and potentials of particular districts: (i) intensive livestock production in 22 districts; and \n(ii)  processing,  marketing,  and  commercialization  of  livestock  subsector  services  in  22  other  districts.  A  livelihoods \npilot program for higher altitudes in five districts will be prepared in the first 3 years of the Project, and implemented \nduring the last 3 years.  \n \nThe Project will support the Tenth Five-Year Plan target of livestock output growth rate of 4.9% annually in the region \nby  a  2.9%  annual  increase  in  livestock  production,  thereby  increasing  per  capita  consumption  of  livestock  products \nfrom 24 kilograms in 2001/2002 to 30 kilograms by 2009. The Project has developed 15 livestock development models \nwhile taking into account cultural preferences, gender, and affordability issues of different categories of farmers, ethnic \ngroups,  and  castes.  The  models  include  several  for  poultry,  goats,  pigs,  for  buffalo  and  forage;  and  one  for  feed \nmilling, thereby expanding the choice of farmers to choose a particular model of investment. The 15 livestock models \nare  expected  to  generate  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  NRs6,604  on  average,  and  assist  the  beneficiaries  to \nenhance their livelihood security through increased caloric and nutritional intake of proteins and micronutrients such as \ncalcium and iron.   \n \nThe  processing,  marketing,  and  commercialization  activities  are  designed  for  the  better-endowed  districts  and  focus \non the central and eastern development regions where there is good east-west, and north-south road access linking \nthe rural hill hinterlands to the large market in the plains and elsewhere by developing small-scale localized processing \nfor  increased  employment.  The  Project  will  promote  the  private  sector  and  local  authorities  to  establish  enterprises \n(live animal markets, small-scale milk and meat processing, input and output services) based on consumer demand.  \nSupporting para-veterinary service centers and credit facilities will be developed in tandem with small-scale meat and \nmilk  businesses.  The  livestock  enterprise  component  is  expected  to  establish  1,050  enterprises  creating  5,100  new \njobs. An increase in milk supply is expected to benefit 95,000 more women and men farmers. \n \n\nB.          Poverty Analysis                      Proposed Classification:  Core Poverty Intervention                                      \n\nGender and Development \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nIn  selecting  project  districts,  poverty  indicators  included  (i)  the  proportion  of  marginal  and  small  farm  holdings \n(weighted for rural  population, and  quality  of land), (ii) the  proportion of ethnic and disadvantaged caste groups, (iii) \npeople  in  low-paying  occupations,  and  unpaid  family  workers,  (iv)  literacy  levels,  and  (v)  lack  of  access  to  drinking \nwater.  Poverty in the majority of the project districts is higher than the national average  of 42%, and is significantly \nhigher  for  disadvantaged  ethnic  groups  comprising  Magar,  Limbu,  Tamang,  and  Lamas  (58%);  lower  caste  groups, \ncomprising  Damai, Kami, and Sarki ( 68%); and Tharu (48%).   \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                    Appendix 10 \n\n51\n\nThe  incidence  of  poverty  is  associated  with  low  per  capita  income,  and  lack  of  services  to  increase  economic \nproductivity  and  social  services  such  as  education  and  health.  The  poor  (men  and  women)  lack  the  means  and  the \nopportunity to challenge customary conventions. They are difficult to reach and hard to organize into groups as they \nface  higher  opportunity  costs,  and  have  less  capacity  to  wait  for  investment  payoffs.  In  the  past,  only  a  small \nproportion of the poor were given training in improved livestock care, or provided with inputs to pursue these activities \nprofitably.  To  address  these  concerns,  the  Project  has  five  components:  (i)  community  development  and  capacity \nbuilding, (ii) livestock productivity improvement, (iii) livestock enterprise development, (iv) a livelihoods  pilot program \nfor  higher  altitudes,  and  (v)  project  management  services.  The  components  are  designed  to  expand  opportunities, \nreduce vulnerability, and develop the capability of the poor. \n \nThe  Project  will  identify  impoverished  areas  by  conducting  needs  assessments  that  will  include  an  inventory  of  the \nproportion  of  disadvantaged  ethnic  and  caste  groups,  among  others,  to  select  livestock  production  pockets  and \nbeneficiary households. Poverty and gender considerations are an integral part of the project design. The Project has \nbuilt-in mechanisms to keep track of the distribution of benefits to different categories of men and women farmers, and \nrequires  undertaking  (i)  a  baseline  survey;  (ii)  preparing  records  of  livestock  groups,  partner  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  microfinance  agencies;  (iii)  a  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  emphasizing \ninvolvement  of  poor  men  and  women,  changes  in  their  well-being  (with  respect  to  basic  needs,  assets,  social \nindicators), and savings and credit; (iv) process monitoring through the reports of community livestock assistants; (v) \nperiodic  review  workshops  on  project  progress,  by  local  livestock  action  teams,  local  authorities,  and  other \nstakeholders;  (vi)  audit  reports  on  NGO  performance;  (vii)  independent  midterm  evaluation  of  the  Project's  results, \npoverty  impact  ratios,  NGO  usefulness  and  sustainability;  (viii)  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  studies;  and  (ix) \napplication of experience from evaluation to shape the future. The Project will develop an information system that will \nidentify key information and indicators at the household, district, department, and ministry levels.  \n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nParticipation strategy    \nThe  Project  promotes  participatory  approaches  by  mobilizing  communities  through  the  formation  of  3,450  farmer \ngroups  of  which  35%  of  the  members  will  be  women.  Within  the  groups,  the  capacity  of  the  participating  men  and \nwomen farmers to voice their concerns will be strengthened through social mobilization and capacity-building activities \noutsourced to locally based NGOs who will be trained to undertake these activities. All the support, technical inputs, \ntraining,  and  microfinance  will  be  based  on  the  group  approach.  In  all  these  processes  the  village  development \ncommittees will be intimately involved, and the community livestock assistants will support women and men during the \nproject period and continue as an independent village resource after project completion.  Livestock action teams will \nplay  a  significant  role  in  coordinating  and  implementing  activities  at  the  district  and  farmers\u2019  level.  This  team  of \nstakeholders  will  become  a  subcommittee  of  the  Agriculture  Development  Committee  in  the  District  Development \nCommittee in compliance with the Local Self-Governance Act 1999, as devolution proceeds.  \n \nSimilarly, the livestock action teams will be established at the village level to improve agency coordination and farmer \nrepresentation at that level. The Project will form an implementation coordination committee at the central level under \nthe  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS);  with  the  participation  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development;  Ministry  of \nWomen,  Social  Welfare  and  Children;  and  other  concerned  line  agencies  to  bring  about  multisector  coordination.  A \nhigh-level  steering  committee  will  be  constituted,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives  with  representation  (at  least  joint  secretary  level)  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment,  Asian  Development  Bank,  National  Planning  Commission,  and  other  relevant  ministries.  The  director \ngeneral  of  DLS  will  be  member  secretary.  The  systems  learning  approach  will  gradually  be  institutionalized  in  the \norganizational framework of the DLS, and in the project management cycle. \n\nD.            Gender \n\nStrategy to Maximize impacts on Women \nThe Project will provide opportunities to address gender concerns by (i) strengthening the institutional capacity of DLS \nthrough the provision of a gender consultant for the 6-year project period;  (ii) mandating 35% women\u2019s participation in \nmixed farmer groups, and in beneficiary-level training activities; (iii) requiring all training activities to have a session on \ngender issues, in addition to specific gender capacity building activities; (iv) recruiting at least 35% women community \nlivestock  assistants  to  ensure  larger  outreach  and  benefits  to  women  farmers;  (v)  improving  women\u2019s  access  to \ntechnology and extension by directing such training to at least 35-50% women; (vi) stipulating at least 35% women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  umbrella  ward-level  farmer  coordination  committees  and  similar  executive  committees;  (vii) \npromoting  one  model  woman  entrepreneur  per  project  district  to  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  enterprise \ndevelopment;  (viii)  ensuring  that  at  least  35%  women  beneficiaries  are  informed  of  project  activities,  including \ninformation on microfinance and lending modalities, and the proposed 15 livestock investment  models;   \n\n \n\n\f52            Appendix 10 \n \n\n(ix) strengthening linkages with the Department of Women Development to expand opportunities to farmer groups; (x) \nfacilitating increased support for gender mainstreaming activities through the establishment of gender focal points at \nthe  field  to  the  center  to  review  progress  made  in  addressing  gender  concerns;  (xi)  requiring  all  data  to  be  gender-\ndisaggregated;  (xii) allocating a budget for gender mainstreaming activities; and (xiii) requiring NGO partners to have \nat  least  50%  women  field  staff.  The  Project  gives  emphasis  to  women\u2019s  non-formal  education  for  business  literacy, \nskills development, savings and credit activities, and participation in production and marketing activities.  \n Output Prepared  \n A gender plan has been prepared and is covenanted.   \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nE. \n\n  \n\nSignificant/Non-\nSignificant/ \nNone  \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nNot applicable \n\nResettlement  \n  \nAffordability \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n\nNonsignificant \n\nNo \n\nTwelve  out  of  15  livestock  enterprise  models  are  within  the \nceiling \nfor  microfinance  under  group  collateral.  The \nhouseholds  can  use  enterprise  credit  for  costlier  activities \nlike  buffalo  raising  for  butter  production,  and  village  feed \nmills.  The  Project  will  take  steps  to  ensure  that  the  cost  of \ncredit  and  inputs  is  reasonable,  and  that  poor  men  and \nwomen farmers have equal access to microfinance through \nappropriate arrangements for collateral. \nWhile  the  Project  will  increase  the  labor  requirement  in \nproduction  activities  to  102  workdays  per  enterprise,  no \nmajor  impact  on  the  labor  market  is  foreseen.  Rather,  the \nProject  will  increase  earning  opportunities  for  women  and \nmen,  and  reduce  the  need  for  male  out-migration.  The \nProject  will  monitor  child  labor  and  compliance  with  the \ninternational  core  labor  standards.  The  Project  will  ensure \nequal pay between men and women for the same work.   \nTen  districts  have  a  significant  presence  of  disadvantaged \nethnic  and  minority  groups.  The  groups  are  the  Magars  in \nPyuthan,  Rolpa,  Tanahu,  and  Palpa;  Tharus  in  Bardiya, \nKailali, and Dang; Lamas in high-altitude Humla and Dolpa; \nand  the  Muslims  in  Banke.  The  project  focus  and  design \ncenter  on  poverty  and  participatory  approaches.  Selection \ncriteria  for  group  membership  ensure  that  disadvantaged \nethnic  and  caste  groups  receive  equal  access  to  project \nbenefits. \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nNonsignificant \n\nPlan \nRequired3 \n\nNone \n\nNo \n\nIf a significant \nnumber of \nindigenous \npeople with \ndifferential \nneeds are \nfound during \nthe baseline \nsurvey, needs-\nbased \nstrategies and \na detailed \naction plan will \nbe developed \nin consultation \nwith the \nrelevant \nstakeholders.   \nNo \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNone \n\nPotential risks include political instability, lack of capacity of \nlocally  based  NGOs,  delays  in  the  devolution  process,  and \ninadequate  interagency  coordination.  Participatory  planning \napproaches  will  ensure  full  participation  of  stakeholders.  \nAny  potential  risk  will  be  addressed,  as  there  is  strong \ngovernment  commitment  and  sense  of  ownership  of  the \nProject. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                      Appendix 11 \n\n \n\n53\n\n \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n\n1. \nDespite the recognition that women do 80% of the work and make many of the day-to-\nday decisions associated with livestock rearing and management, little attention has been paid \nto  gender  in  livestock  subsector  strategies.  Consequently,  extension  and  training  are  often \nprovided to men on the erroneous assumption that the message will trickle down to women as a \nresult, livestock knowledge has been transferred inefficiently, or not at all, from husband to wife. \nThe Project will address these concerns by taking actions that (i) increase the number of women \nin  contact  with  extension  services,  (ii)  increase  gender  sensitivity  among  policymakers  and \nmanagers, and (iii) require the impact to be evaluated regularly.  \n \nTo build institutional capacity to undertake gender related actions the Project will recruit \n2. \na gender consultant for the 6-year project period. The consultant will assist the Department of \nLivestock Services in developing an integrated medium-term policy framework for the subsector \nwith the objective of securing an increasing role for women in livestock development through (i) \na  recruitment  policy  for  female  staff,  (ii)  stronger  involvement  of  female  staff  in  planning  and \nimplementing  at  district  level,  (iii)  a  field  service  that  is  sensitive  to  and  inclusive  of  gender \nissues, (iv) plans for encouraging women in livestock production and marketing activities, and a \n(v) means of measuring progress in this direction through monitoring and evaluation. All project \nstaff will receive training on gender and organizational change. In addition, all capacity-building \nactivities will be required to have a session on gender issues to ensure that gender issues are \nbeing  mainstreamed.  Available  women  project  staff  will  be  targeted  for  training.  Gender  focal \npoints  comprising  men  and  women  will  be  formed  from  the  central  to  field  levels.  The  project \nmanager  will  act  as  the  gender  focal  point  and  will  call  periodic  meetings  of  all  gender  focal \npoints  to  monitor  progress  through  gender-disaggregated  data,  and  provide  feedback  during \nimplementation. \n \nAt the community level, the Project will (i) mandate 35% women\u2019s participation in mixed \n3. \nfarmer groups, and in beneficiary level training and capacity-building activities; (ii) recruit at least \n35%  women  from  among  the  390  community  livestock  assistants  proposed  for  the  Project  to \npreclude  tilting  the  gender  imbalance  against  women  as  a  result  of  modernization;  (iii)  secure \n35-50% women\u2019s participation in technology-related training; (iv) require at least 35% women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  umbrella  ward-level  farmer  coordination  committees,  and  similar  executive \ncommittees;  (v)  promote  one  model  woman  entrepreneur  per  project  district  to  increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in enterprise development; (vi) develop the concept of male and female \nwomen  leader  farmers  who  will  receive  appropriate  training  to  disseminate  information  on \nproject  activities,  marketing,  credit,  and  lending  modalities  of  the  proposed  15  livestock \ninvestment models; (vii) allocate a budget for gender mainstreaming activities; and (viii) ensure \nequal  pay  for  work  of  equal  value.  Male-only  groups  will  not  be  formed  under  the  Project.  To \nincrease women\u2019s participation, farmer group discussions, meetings, and training will be held at \ntimes  and  locations  convenient  to  women.  Documentation  of  women\u2019s  participation  compared \nwith  that  of  men  will  be  maintained  by  the  Project.  Selection  criteria  for  potential  NGOs  to \nundertake  social  mobilization  work  will  include  sensitivity  to  gender  issues.  NGOs  will  be \nrequired  to have  at  least  50%  women  field  staff.  Additional  literacy  training  will  be  provided  to \nwomen  at  locations  where  a  low  level  of  literacy  is  likely  to  constitute a  constraint  to  livestock \nenterprise development. \n\n \n\n\f54           Appendix 12 \n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the  Community  Livestock  Development \n1. \nProject was conducted by means of on-site visits, review of literature, meetings and workshops \nwith stakeholders, and team interaction. This appendix gives a summary of the IEE. \n \nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n2. \nThe Project will be implemented in 48 districts of Nepal. Livestock production programs \nwill  be  undertaken  in  22  districts  where  an  estimated  69,000  beneficiary  households  are \nexpected  to  benefit  from  project  activities.  In  this  area  are  over  1.5  million  ruminant  livestock \nunits, reared largely under free grazing conditions. The Project will focus on social mobilization, \nraising  awareness,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  farmers  and  other  stakeholders  to \nparticipate in planning and implementing the Project. The Project will improve the animal feed \nbase  in  quality  and  quantity  by  promoting  forage  legumes  and  fodder  trees.  Some  livestock \nsuch  as  pigs  and  poultry  will  be  reared  under  intensive  management,  and  the  stall-feeding  of \ngoats  and  larger  ruminants  will  be  encouraged.  Environment-friendly  biogas  technology  will \nreceive priority in the animal production districts, and microfinance will be provided to farmers. \nLivestock  enterprises  being  offered  to  communities  are  those  that  poor  families,  women,  and \ndisadvantaged groups have already expressed interest in adopting. \n \n3. \nA second component of the project concerns processing and marketing of livestock and \ntheir products. The component covers an area of about 22 districts with 2.4 million households, \nof which 95,000 are expected to benefit. In these districts commercialized livestock production \nunits  are  emerging  along  roadsides  and  within,  and  adjacent  to,  urban  centers.  For  livestock \nprocessing  and  marketing  development,  the  Project  provides  commercial  credit,  technical \nbackstopping,  and  various  inputs  such  as  live  animal  markets,  milk  chilling  centers, \nslaughterhouses,  slaughter  slabs,  and  several  livestock  product  processing  and  retailing \nfacilities.  \n \nA  study  will  also  be  carried  out  in  five  high-altitude  districts  to  establish  a  knowledge \n4. \nbase and a livelihoods pilot program on livestock production, and a marketing system suited to \nthe  underdeveloped,  poorly  accessible,  and  environmentally  sensitive  characteristics  of  the \narea.  \n \n5. \nOne  component  is  devoted  to  enhancing  the  capacity  of  farmers,  and  village-  and \ndistrict-based livestock professionals and para-professionals, and strengthening the capacity of \nthe Department of Livestock Services (DLS) and other relevant institutions in the project area \nto manage livestock and natural resources in an environmentally beneficial manner.  \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \n\nThe project area ranges in altitude from 100 meters above sea level in the lowlands to \n6. \n7,893  meters  above  sea  level  in  Lamjung  district,  and  covers  lowland,  low  hills,  middle  hills, \nand  mountains.  The  project  area  can  be  divided  into  subtropical,  warm  temperate,  cool \ntemperate,  sub-alpine,  and  alpine  climatic  zones.  Climatic  variations  are  extreme  due  to \naltitude,  aspect,  and  the  continentally  influenced  seasons.  Steep  slopes  and  high  rainfall \nintensity result in significant soil loss and landslides. Active alluvial soils are found in the river \nvalleys  and  in  the  plains.  The  ratio  of  cultivated  to  noncultivated  area  in  the  western  project \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                      Appendix 12 \n\n \n\n55\n\narea ranges from 3.17 to 63.6, and grassland occupies 3.2-31.5% of the land area. Livestock \nholdings  per  household  vary  from  3.1  to  7.0  units  in  the  project  area,  though  in  parts  of  the \ncommercialization, processing, and marketing areas this figure reaches 100 livestock units.  \n \nThe biological diversity in the project area is of international importance in terms of the \n7. \nnumber  of  globally  threatened  species  of  wild  flora  and  fauna.  Tropical  riverine  forest  and \ntropical  evergreen  forest  dominate  the  lowland  areas,  and  suffer  greatly  from  lopping  for \nanimal feed and felling for timber. The middle hill ecosystem (1,000-3,000 meters above sea \nlevel)  has  the  greatest  species  diversity.  Highlands  above  3,000  meters  are  the  meeting \nplaces  for  two  major  geographical  regions  in  which  38  ecosystems  are  found.  Within  the \nproject area, several endangered plant and animal species are found. Blue sheep, wild goats, \nthe  snow  leopard,  the  single-horn  rhinoceros,  and  freshwater  dolphins  are  notable.  Though \nhumans  have  disturbed  much  of  the  forest  area,  large  tracts  are  still  intact.  There  are  no \nreports  of  plant  or  animal  species  that  have  become  extinct,  though  some  of  them  are \nendangered.   \n \n8.  Within the project area are heritage sites of international importance such as the Royal \nChitwan  National  Park,  wetlands  such  as  the  Koshi  Tappu  in  Sunsari  district  (a  wetlands \nhabitat  for  waterfowl).  These  environmental  resources  are  protected  under  the  Forest  Act \n(1993), National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973), and the Environment Protection \nAct (1996). The area is also rich in different aspects of human culture maintained by different \nethnic groups.  \n \n9.  \nThe  monsoon  is  the  main  rainy  season  (June-September)  when  over  80%  of  the  total \nprecipitation and periods of high rainfall intensity occur. Over 6,000 rivers and streams drain \nthe country. Several major rivers and a large number of their tributaries drain the project area. \nThe Sapta Koshi in the east, Seti Gandaki, Kali Gandaki, and the Karnali are the major river \nsystems.  \n \n10. \nAmbient  air  quality  is  excellent  in  most  parts  of  the  project  area.  In  the  remote  areas, \nindoor  air  pollution  is  common  due  to  use  of  fuelwood  in  cooking.  In  the  urban  areas, \nparticularly  in  the  Kathmandu  valley,  air  quality  is  deteriorating  because  of  vehicles  and \nindustrialization.  Urbanized  areas  also  have  problems  with  water,  air,  and  noise  pollution. \nDeforestation, land degradation, and landslides are environmental hazards already occurring in \nthe project area.  \n \nD.  \n \n11.   The  Project  may  produce  some  potential  long-term  impacts.  Native  species  (genetic \nbiodiversity)  such  as  indigenous  forage  species  may  not  be  able  to  compete  with  faster \ngrowing  introduced  species,  and  the  latter  may  dominate.  Action  research  and  on-station \nevaluation of introduced species are warranted. These effects are not easy to mitigate as they \nare  directly  related  to  the  economic  benefit  requirements  of  poor  families.  The  impact  on  the \nenvironment  of  uncontrolled  grazing  and  trampling,  especially  in  forests,  grazing  lands,  and \ncommunal lands, is potentially a higher risk but also manageable. In product processing areas, \nthe environmental problems are more related to pollution of water, air, and land, but they can \nbe mitigated. \n \n12.   Stakeholders  need  to  internalize  the  concept  of  environmental  protection  and \nconservation  of  indigenous  species  at  each  stage  and  each  level  of  project  implementation. \nStakeholders\u2019  environmental  awareness  must  be  raised  and  their  capacity  to  manage  or \n\nPotential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\n\f56           Appendix 12 \n \n\nreduce  environmental  impacts,  both  positive  and  negative,  must  be  improved.  Mitigation \nstrategies  include  avoiding  environmental  damage  or  risk  through  proper  planning,  using \nenvironmentally  sound  technology  and  designs,  and  controlling  adverse  impacts  by  adopting \nproper management practices. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  will  impact  on  the  environment,  especially  in  forested  areas  (used  as  a \nfodder source), grazing lands, communal lands (due to grazing, trampling, and littering), and on \nthe genetic diversity of native species. However, the environmental impacts of these activities \nwill  be  insignificant.  In  areas  where  processing  and  marketing  are  being  developed,  the \nenvironmental  impact  is  more  related  to  pollution  of  water,  air,  and  land.  Each  of  the  project \ncomponents has been screened for significance and potential impacts. During implementation \nthe environmental impacts of marketing and processing subprojects will be carefully screened. \n \n14. \nLand  Pollution.  Solid  waste  such  as  plastics,  packing  materials,  animal  manure, \ndisposable  syringes,  and  animal  health  center  waste  can  pollute  the  land,  and  a  method  of \nseparating biodegradable and recyclable elements of the wastes at source is required. These \nwastes  need  to  be  appropriately  disposed  of  in  biogas  plants,  in  designated  manure  and \ncompost pits, or in trenches for burning waste. \n \n15.  Water  Pollution.  Without  guidelines  and  controls,  effluent  generated  by  dairy \nprocessing  plants,  slaughterhouses,  slaughter  slabs,  and  milk  chilling  centers  is  likely  to  be \ndischarged into natural water bodies. Effluent, especially that containing chemicals, adversely \naffects  humans,  and  aquatic  and  plant  life.  Each  processing  unit  will  be  required  to  treat \neffluent,  and  treatment  systems  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  project  design  and  approval \nprocess.  Sedimentation,  oxidation,  or  treatment  ponds  where  the  discharge  will  meet \nacceptable biochemical oxygen demand levels will be implemented. \n \n16. \nAir  Pollution.  Air  pollution  occurs  within  and  around  intensive  livestock  production \nfacilities  such  as  piggeries,  processing  units,  slaughter  sites,  and  marketing  areas.  Such \nimpacts  can  be  minimized  by  maintaining  acceptable  hygiene  standards  (to  be  established \nunder  the  Project),  spraying  water,  and  using  air  purifiers  and  other  air-circulating  devices \nwithin the units as appropriate. \n \nE. \n \n17. \nAt the national level, the National Planning Commission and the Ministry of Population \nand  Environment  are  the  main  institutions  mandated  to  formulate  and  enforce  environment \npolicy and law for the country. They also monitor trends and effects.  \n \n18. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives  (MOAC),  the  Department  of  Livestock \nServices  (DLS)  and  its  district  offices,  and  district  development  committees  will  be  directly \ninvolved  in  implementing  the  Project.  The  capacity  of  these  institutions  to  undertake  IEEs  of \nthe  subprojects  is  weak,  as  none  of  the  institutions  have  staff  trained  in  environmental \nappraisal. Several private consultancy firms have project experience and could be contracted \nfor  this  purpose.  Unfortunately,  almost  all  of  them  are  based  in  Kathmandu  and  do  not  have \ntheir  own  staff,  as  they  recruit  professionals  on  a  short-term  basis.  Therefore,  environmental \nmonitoring  capacity  and  capability  are  largely  lacking  in  the  livestock  subsector  at  field  level, \nand any monitoring tends to be project related and project driven.  \n \n19. \nThe livestock productivity component will have insignificant environmental impacts. For \nthe  livestock  processing  and  marketing  component,  a  four-step  environmental  management \n\nInstitutional Requirements for Environmental Monitoring \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                      Appendix 12 \n\n \n\n57\n\nprocess will be followed. First, a small environment monitoring team will be established in the \nplanning  division  of  DLS,  and  DLS  staff  capability  will  be  strengthened  through  technical \nassistance, training, and awareness building. The monitoring team will be independent of the \nimplementation  team.  It  will  visit  subprojects  that  are  potentially  environmentally  significant, \nhold  meetings,  and  prepare  terms  of  reference  for  the  subproject  IEE  as  required  by  the \nEnvironment Protection Act and regulations. Second, the IEE team will prepare a preliminary \nsummary  of  relevant  information  and  checklist.  Third,  the  IEE  team  will  meet  with  relevant \nstakeholders to solicit their views on the subproject, and collect field level information through a \nconsultative  process  as  required  by  the  environmental  regulation.  Fourth,  the  IEE  team  will \nanalyze  the  information  collected,  recommend  appropriate  cost-effective  mitigation  measures \nto  cope  with  any  adverse  impacts,  while  enhancing  any  positive  impacts.  The  IEE  team  will \nprepare  a  report  on  its  findings  as  prescribed  by  the  Environment  Protection  Act  and  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  approved  format,  which  is  acceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nThe  subproject  report  will  be  submitted  to  DLS,  MOAC,  and  ADB.  Training  in  environmental \nmonitoring will also be given to district-based staff. Provision has been made for an appropriate \nbudget to implement needed mitigation measures. \n \nF. \n \n20. \nThere is a close relationship between poverty and environmental degradation. Most of \nthe  project  area  has  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  and  communities  are  not  well  served  by \ngovernment institutions. All the components of the proposed Project will be screened following \nADB  guidelines.  The  IEE  shows  that  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  are  not  severe,  and \nare  general  in  nature.  Therefore,  the  Project  does  not  need  further  study  such  as  an \nenvironmental impact assessment. Properly implementing prevailing laws and regulations and \nraising the awareness of stakeholders, and the prompt response of institutions to the adverse \nimpacts can mitigate the likely adverse effects. Proper implementation of the recommendations \nand monitoring are essential to achieve the desired objectives. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  18 November 2003) \n", " \nCurrency Unit \nNRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", " \n", " \nNepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.01292 \nNRs77.4 \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  Nepalese  rupee  is  pegged  to  the  Indian  rupee  (Re)  at  NRs1.60  to  Re1.00  and  is \nfully convertible on all current account transactions. \nFor  calculations  in  this  report,  the  exchange  rate  of  $1.00  =  NRs76.0  is  used,  the  rate \nprevailing during fact-finding. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nagricultural gross domestic product \ncommunity-based organization \ncommunity livestock assistant \nCommunity Livestock Development Project \ndistrict development committee \nDepartment of Livestock Services \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \nhectare \nimplementation coordination committee \ninitial environmental examination \nlivestock action team \nmicrofinance intermediary \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives \nnongovernment organization \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nRural Microfinance Development Center \nstatement of expenditure \nThird Livestock Development Project \nvillage development committee \n", " \n", "- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB \n \nAGDP   \nCBO \n \n \nCLA \nCLDP   \n \nDDC \n \nDLS \n \nEA \n \nEIRR \n \nFIRR \n \nha \n \nICC \n \nIEE \n \nLAT \n \nMFI \nMOAC  \n \nNGO \n \nPMU \n \nPSC \nRMDC  \nSOE \n \nTLDP   \n \nVDC \n", " \n", "NOTES \n \n", " \n", " \n", "(ii) \n \n", "(i)  The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  15  July.
