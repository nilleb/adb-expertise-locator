An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  and the summary is a supplementary appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The main thrust of the Project is rehabilitation of the selected \nirrigation and drainage facilities, which are in  a critical state of \ndisrepair;  provision  of  associated  farm  production  support \nservices; and construction of rural water supply in main cotton \nproduction regions of Khatlon  and Sughd. In parallel with these, \nthe  Project  aims  to  accelerate  the  ongoing  agriculture  reform \nprocess by building capacity of the public sector agencies as well \nas  farmers\u2019  organizations.  The  three  irrigation  schemes  of  (i) \nKhojabakirgan  irrigation  system  (Sughd  region),  (ii)  Vakhsh \nirrigation  system  (Khatlon  region),  and  (iii)  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu \nirrigation system (Khatlon region), cover a total cultivated area of \n85,000 hectares (ha) and nearly half million people depend on the \nirrigation water for their livelihood. The Project will also provide \nagricultural  support  services  to  the  newly-organized  privately-\nmanaged  farms  by  establishing  farm  machinery  units  and \npromoting crop production technologies. \n   \nRationale  Since its independence, Tajikistan has been struggling to reform \nits agriculture sector, which provides livelihood for 52% of the \nworkforce  through  farm  restructuring  and  trade  and  policy \nliberalization.  Due  to  the  widespread  poverty,  inefficiency  of \ntraditional farm structures, and weak fiscal capacity, the progress \nin reform has been slow. As a part of reform processes, the \nGovernment  withdrew  state  financing  of  cotton  production\u2013the \ncountry\u2019s main source of foreign exchange earning\u2013in mid-1990s, \nreplacing  it  with  international  private  finance.  Weak  loan \nadministration and decline in the world price of cotton fiber that \nfollowed, however, resulted in the accumulation of farm debts. \n \nNevertheless,  agriculture  remains  a  key  economic  sector  for \nTajikistan,  contributing  about  20%  of  gross  domestic  product. \nAgricultural  production  in  Tajikistan  is  crucially dependent on \nirrigation, without which the  land has little production potential. \nThe extensive irrigation system, which was mostly built during the \nformer Soviet Union, covers about 0.8 million ha, or nearly half the \ncountry\u2019s relatively flat land. Many of the irrigation systems involve \npumping. These irrigation and associated drainage systems are \nrapidly deteriorating due to  inadequate management during the \ncivil war and the lack of operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \nThe Government recognizes the need to expand and deepen the \nongoing reform process to restore farmers\u2019 incentives, improve ", "iv \nongoing reform process to restore farmers\u2019 incentives, improve \nproductivity  and  profitability  of  agriculture,  and  improve  living \nconditions of rural population that accounts for more than 70% of \ntotal  population.  At  the  same  time, the Government is keenly \naware of the immediate need to ensure the security of irrigation \nwater supply by rehabilitating key irrigation and drainage systems \non a priority basis and providing other key rural infrastructure, \nparticularly rural water supply.  \n \nRehabilitating the infrastructure will result in reliable irrigation and \npotable  water  supply  and  drainage  services  that  will,  with \nagriculture support services, capacity building, and a favorable \npolicy environment, increase farm yields and family incomes. This \nwill  lead  to  improved  standard  of  living  and  reduced  poverty. \nProper  O&M  arrangements  and  cost  recovery  will  ensure \nsustained benefits. \n   \nObjectives  The Project\u2019s objectives are to (i) improve living conditions of the \nfarming  communities  in  the  project  area,  and  (ii)  institute \nmeasures to sustain benefits of improvements implemented under \nthe Project. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $43.75  million  equivalent,  of \nwhich  $24.43  million  (56%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$19.32 million equivalent (44%) the local currency cost.

The Minister, MWRLR will be designated as project director \nwith overall responsibility for project  implementation.  A  project \nmanagement office will be established to manage project activities \non a daily basis, and to liaise with ADB and the coordinating \nbodies. Three project implementation units one in each project \narea,  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation  and \nmaintaining  liaison  with  the  project  management  office,  local \nadministration,  and  beneficiary  organizations.

All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will provide 89 person-months of international and \n1,862 person-months of domestic consultants to assist in areas \nfor which enough technical capacity is currently not available in \nGovernment agencies. The consultants will assist the MWRLR in \n(i) agriculture support services; (ii) institutional capacity building; \n(iii)  surveys,  design,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  bid \nevaluation,  and  construction  supervision;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation. The consultants will be \nengaged  in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the \nengagement of the domestic consultants, using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit an irrigation service area of 85,000 \nBeneficiaries  ha  and  471,500  people.  The  improvements  in  main  diversion \nworks will indirectly benefit an additional irrigation service area of \n67,500  ha  and  359,000  people.  The  average  cotton  yield  is \nexpected to increase from 1.5 to 2.4 tons/ha and wheat from 1.2 \nto 2.0 tons/ha. The cropping intensity is expected to increase by \n21%. Annual cotton production in the project area is expected to \nincrease from 66,909 to 131,812 tons and wheat from 42,917 to \n69,758 tons until year 9 and stabilize thereafter. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  22.9%.

While ADB is currently assisting the \nGovernment  to  improve  its  disaster  preparedness,  the  project \nsites were selected with particular attention to avoid undue risks of \nthese natural calamities. \n \nAccumulated farm debts are also a major risk, affecting farmers\u2019 \nproduction incentives and  the  financial  sustainability  of  many \ncotton  farms.  The  Government  is  committed  to  resolving the \nissues, and will create a high-level task force to develop a debt \nresolution  strategy  and  identify  other  relevant policy/legislative \nactions.  The  Project  provides  associated  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) to assist the task force.  \n \nThe possibility of renewed civil conflict is receding as the peace \naccord is sustained. The risks of implementation delays arising \nfrom unfamiliarity of the MWRLR with ADB procedure has been \npartly  mitigated  by  involving  MWRLR  staff  during  project \nprocessing. MWRLR staff\u2019s knowledge of ADB\u2019s procedures will \nbe enhanced during the implementation period. The issues of \ndelays in the farm reorganization process, old farm management \npractices  and  administrative  controls  over  production,  and \nmarketing barriers are being addressed under the policy reforms. \n \nSustainability  of  benefits  will  be  threatened  if  proper  O&M \narrangements are not in place or the beneficiaries fail to meet the \nO&M costs. These aspects have been addressed and appropriate \nassurances have been obtained from the Government. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A grant of $960,000 equivalent financed by the Japan Special \nFund funded by the Government of Japan will provide services of \n27  person-months  of  international  and  54  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants. The TA will assist the Government in (i) \nresolving  accumulated  farm  debts;  and  (ii)  promoting, \nimplementing, and monitoring the  policy reforms, particularly in \nagriculture marketing and water resources management. The TA \nwill also assist the  Government in establishing unique grades for \nTajikistan cotton that are recognized in the international markets \nand launch an information campaign for the farmers. ADB will \nengage consultants following ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and arrangements for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants using quality- and cost-based selection method.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  At the request of the Government of Tajikistan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a TA1 to prepare an agriculture rehabilitation project. The project preparatory TA was \ncarried out from February to July 2001 and built upon the previously completed Agriculture \nSector Assessment Study.2 This document is based on the consultants\u2019 reports, the findings of \nthe missions, and discussions with national and local government agencies, potential project \nbeneficiaries, and nongovernmental organizations, particularly those held during the roundtable \ndiscussions in Dushanbe on 8 and 9 October 2002. Project framework is in Appendixes 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Tajikistan has a population of 6.1 million with a growth rate of 1.7% per annum and an \naverage life expectancy of 64. About 73% of the population live in rural areas and 18% of \nhouseholds have a female as head of the family. As a result of the termination of fiscal transfers \nand sharp decline in agricultural productivity, rural incomes have plunged over the past decade. \nThe agriculture sector is estimated to employ 52% of the workforce but unemployment and \nunderemployment levels are high. On average, at least 30% of rural households have no paid \nemployment. Salaries are paid in kind, either inputs (used on household plots) or food, usually \nwheat. Most rural families rely heavily on their household land plots of about 0.1 ha, which \ntypically account for more than half of total income. Consequently, these plots have become \nefficient  integrated  food  production  systems  contributing  about  40%  of  total  agricultural \nproduction. \n \n4.  As the rural economy collapsed, the provision of social services also went into steep \ndecline. The former state and collective farms, which had been responsible for supporting \nprimary education and health services as well as rural water supplies, were no longer able to \nfund  them.  The  incidence  of  many  serious  diseases,  such  as  tuberculosis,  typhoid,  and \nintestinal infections, has increased substantially. A similar situation prevails in education . Also, \nmost water supply systems are defunct and many rural communities depend on surface water \nfor their domestic needs with the inevitable risk of infection. Less than 2% of the households are \nconnected to sewerage systems. \n \n5.  Against this background it is inevitable that poverty is widespread; nationally, 83% of the \npopulation had spending below the poverty threshold of TJS20/month. Poverty levels in the rural \nareas are even higher, rising to 89% in Khatlon region. The principal cause of poverty is the lack \nof job opportunities or very low salaries arising from the low productivity of irrigated agriculture. \nIn 2000, productivity levels plunged to less that half of those of 1990. The Government has \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Agriculture Sector Assessment Project. Manila ", "2 \nrecognized this correlation in  its Poverty Reduction Strategy3 and has made improvement of \nagriculture sector performance the core of its strategy. \n \n6.  Tajikistan remains a predominantly agricultural economy. The sector contributes about \n20% of gross domestic product, 30% of export revenues (mostly cotton), and 35% of tax \nrevenues. It also provides the major source of employment. Almost 80% of Tajikistan\u2019s arable \narea is irrigated. Consequently, issues relating to the irrigation have a very significant impact on \nagriculture and on the economy as a whole. Given the Tajikistan agro-climatic conditions, the \nGovernment and the farmers consider cotton as the most important cash crop. Its profitability in \nthe recent past has, however, been reduced mainly because of (i) low productivity resulting from \ndysfunctional irrigation and drainage systems and inappropriate use of crop inputs, and (ii) \ndecline in international prices. Local consumption of the cotton is only 30%, mainly in the textile \nand garment industry. Currently, there is little interest in developing the downstream industry to \nincrease domestic consumption. \n \n7.  Since independence, the Government has initiated a range of reforms intended to \ntransform the agriculture sector into a competitive market-led economy. The state procurement \nsystem  for  agricultural  commodities  was  dismantled  together  with  direct  administrative \ninterventions in input and output markets. Price controls were removed and trade barriers \nrelaxed. Land reform is ongoing within a framework, that allows private farms to operate based \non lifelong inheritable leases. Payment for irrigation water delivery has been introduced and \nefforts are being made toward the full recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of \nirrigation systems. The implementation of these reforms has, however, not been satisfactory \nparticularly because of interventions by local administrations.  \n \n8.  The reforms have brought only modest gains compared to the scale of the losses to the \neconomy since independence. The current  cultivated area (irrigated and rainfed) is around \n710,000 hectares (ha), which is a reduction of about 17% over the past decade. Farms have \naccumulated debts over the last 6 years mainly because of (i) low productivity of the sector, \nparticularly of cotton because of deterioration of irrigation and drainage facilities, absence of \nrural support services, and inappropriate use of credit; and (ii) low prices of cotton in the \ninternational market. Cotton yields across the country average 1.4 tons (t)/ha compared to 2.8 \nt/ha before independence. Cereal yields are also low, averaging 1.3 t/ha in 2000 compared to \n1990 yield of 1.4 t/ha. These shifts have resulted in marked changes in output. In 2000, \nTajikistan produced only 335,000 t cotton compared to over 800,000 t in 1990. These declines \nin sector performance are connected with wider key problems described in next section. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Land Reform and Farm Reorganization. Land remains state owned. Families either \nindividually or collectively are given land-use rights, which can be passed on through inheritance \nbut are not tradable. These limitations restrict the evolution of commercial agriculture. Further \nsteps are needed to broaden and deepen land-use rights. The lack of clear procedures under \nthe existing Law on Dehkan Farms4 adopted in 1992 for land allocation to private farmers and \nfor dispute settlement has resulted in the decisions of local authorities being viewed as arbitrary, \nsometimes involving unfair elements. To remove these flaws, the Parliament amended the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction Strategy for the Republic of Tajikistan. Manila. The Poverty Reduction Strategy was \napproved by the Parliament in June 20002 and signing of the Poverty Partnership Agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB is scheduled in December 2002. \n4  A dehkan farm is individually or collectively privately-managed farm. ", "3 \nabove law in 2002. Most of the land reform issues are being addressed by ongoing World Bank \nProjects and bilateral agencies (Appendix2). \n \n10.  Agricultural Marketing and Farm Debts. By the end of 1996, Tajikistan had officially \nabolished production targets and administered pricing for all agricultural commodities. These \nreforms  were  followed  by  the  privatization  of  all  23  state-owned  cotton  ginneries  after \ndismantling of barriers to private sector entry into the cotton ginning and wheat flour milling \nindustries. Since 1997, cotton has suffered from a nearly 30% fall in world cotton prices. This fall \nhas exacerbated the task of repaying commercial loans that were provided by Agroinvest Bank \nused to fund cotton production and were guaranteed by the Government. The total commercial \ndebt of the industry including working capital is about $120 million spread across most of the \nlarger farms. The major effort launched to clear this debt includes requiring the farms with debt \nto plant 70% of their land to cotton (through so called \u201ccotton balances\u201d), and to enter into \nforward purchasing contracts with the creditors (called investors, generally one specified by \nlocal administration for each district) who are providing inputs (fertilizer and fuel) at above-\nmarket prices. Farms without debt are also under pressure by local administrations to grow \ncotton, but are free to sell their product to local textile factories. The export of raw cotton is not \npermitted and export of cotton fiber is, effectively, a monopoly. This situation is placing a heavy \nburden on rural communities in general and particularly upon the managers and employees of \nindebted farms. Details on cotton sector issues are in Appendix 3. \n \n11.  Based  on  policy  discussions  during  loan  processing,  the  Government  issued  two \nPresidential decrees in September 2002 that exempted the 2002 cotton crop from value added \ntax and abolished cotton balances. This has reduced regional and district administrations\u2019 roles \nin making decisions regarding cotton production, terminated the monopoly of Agroinvest Bank, \nand given farmers a free choice on investors thus facilitating competition among investors. Also, \naccording to an earlier resolution, the farmers can now trade raw cotton. With the policy reforms \nagreed with the external funding agencies, particularly the World Bank, and those implemented \nrecently, the policy environment is conducive to improvements in agriculture sector through \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building interventions. However effective coordination \nis needed among funding agencies to monitor the implementation of the reforms. \n \n12.  The  Government  is  committed  to  resolve  the  farm  debts,  accelerate  farms \nreorganization, and promote farm investment opportunities. In this context, on the request of the \nGovernment, ADB organized a meeting in Dushanbe during 8\u20139 October 2002. The meeting \nprovided an opportunity for open and frank discussion among all stakeholders. The main \ndiscussion related to (i) unfair and one-sided contracts offered by investors and the need to \ndelink  investment  from  input  of  supplies  and  marketing  of  the  outputs;  (ii)  write-off  or \nrescheduling of debt to Government agencies; (iii) establishment of a task force to study the \ndebt issues, develop debt resolution strategy, and monitor implementation of policy reforms; (iv) \nneed for agricultural credit from other sources to provide healthy competition with existing \ninvestors; and (v) urgent need to rehabilitate irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The meeting \nparticipants  also  recommended  to  the  Government  to  facilitate  implementation  of  existing \nresolutions asking the investors to allow the farmers to transfer production advances to bank \naccounts reserved for use of production inputs, and allow trading of raw cotton. Also, the \nGovernment was requested to standardize the contracts for the 2003 year production and run \nan  information  awareness  campaign.  ADB  was  requested  to  finance  the  (i)  information \nA\ncampaign, (ii) establishment of unique grades for Tajikistan cotton that are recognized in the  p\np\ne\ninternational markets, and (iii) the task force.  n\nd\n  ix\n 0\n \n3\n \n ", "4 \n13.  Water Management Issues. Agricultural production in Tajikistan dependents cruically \non irrigation, without which the land has little production potential. Extensive irrigation systems, \nmostly built during the time of the former Soviet Union, cover nearly half the country\u2019s relatively \nflat land. The irrigation and associated drainage systems are rapidly deteriorating due to poor \nmanagement during the civil war and the lack of  O&M. About a third of the irrigated area use \npumps to lift water from a few meters to over 300 m involving a cascade of pumping stations. \nAbout 75,000 ha of command area require water to be pumped at least 150 m. However, only \n60% of pumping capacity is operational with a corresponding decline in irrigation volumes. A \nsimilar situation applies to the drainage systems; their neglect is leading to higher groundwater \nlevels, water logging, and salinization. According to the agreement among the countries of the \nAral Sea basin, enough water is allocated to serve Tajikistan\u2019s irrigation systems. However, the \nwater is not being adequately used because of dysfunctional irrigation systems and poor water \nmanagement. Improving the performance of irrigated agriculture requires rehabilitating irrigation \nand drainage systems and more efficient water management. \n \n14.  The rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems is inextricably linked to the issue of \ncost recovery and the maintenance of such relatively expensive systems. Water charges were \nintroduced in 1996 and collection rates average less than 40% of billed amounts, but even if the \ncharges were fully introduced and collected, they would cover only about 10% of maintenance \ncosts, excluding energy costs. In addition, water charges do not differentiate between gravity \nand pump irrigation systems. The structure of irrigation water charges need to be rationalized to \nreflect differences in system costs; the basic water delivery fee should be increased to at least \nmaintain its real value and collection rates must be improved substantially. The Government is \ncommitted under an ongoing World Bank project5 to gradually increase recovery rates of the \nwater delivery cost over 10 years and to provide funds to make up the shortfall during the \ntransition period. \n \n15.  The recently-approved Water Code provides a basis for the formation of water users\u2019 \nassociations (WUAs) that will be responsible for O&M of the tertiary systems and contribute to \nthe cost of maintaining the secondary and primary systems through water charges payable to \nthe local water agencies. This calls for an increased sense of partnership between WUAs and \nwater  management  agencies.  The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Land  Reclamation \n(MWRLR) needs assistance to review its institutional capacity and structure in order to meet the \nimpending requirements. \n \n16.  Agriculture  Support  Services.  Many  newly-organized  dehkan  farms  with  limited \nfarming knowledge would benefit from a program of farm demonstrations designed to illustrate \nthe technologies that could dramatically increase their productivity. Farmers using relatively \nexpensive irrigation water need to learn how to (i) improve crop yields, (ii) intensify their crop \nrotations, and (iii) diversify their cropping to achieve higher revenues. Three areas of support \nhave been identified: (i) farm demonstration activities related to soil fertility and crop husbandry, \n(ii) increasing the availability of improved seeds, and (iii) provision of farm machinery. The \nprivate  sector  need  to  be  shown  the  viability  of  the  farm  machinery  rental  business  by \nestablishing farm machinery units (FMUs) and running them on commercial basis. \n \n17.  Rural Potable Water Supply. Nationally, there are over 600 water supply networks, \nwhich originally provided 60% of the population with piped water. As a result of damage during \nthe civil conflict and lack of maintenance, most rural potable water networks have deteriorated, \n                                                 \n5   World Bank. 2000.

Excluding \ndistrict centers, the proportion of households with access to piped water is less than 20%. Even \nwhere a pipe network exists, many are in a state of disrepair forcing households to collect water \nfrom as far away as 10 kilometers. The increased dependency on surface water sources has \nresulted in a much higher incidence of waterborne diseases in rural areas. All of the targeted \ndistricts have incidence rates of typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, and malaria ranging from 130% to \n230% of the national average. These districts are the  poor communities that have the least \naccess to drinking water and are most susceptible to waterborne diseases. \n \n18.  Government Plans and ADB Interim Operational Strategy. The Government, as a \npart of its rural development strategy,6 is committed to (i) continuing the farm reorganization \nprogram, (ii) improving the efficiency of irrigation water use, (iii) developing a rural credit system, \n(iv) rehabilitating key irrigation facilities, and (v) implementing a poverty reduction program with \na substantial agriculture sector component. The ADB interim operational strategy for Tajikistan \nwas approved in 1998, before the adoption of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and thus did not \nhave an explicit poverty focus. The objectives of the interim operational strategy are to (i) \nfacilitate the country\u2019s transition to a market economy, (ii) assist postconflict rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, and (iii) support natural disaster rehabilitation. Three priority sectors have been \nidentified: agriculture, infrastructure, and the social sector. \n \n19.  Agriculture Sector Assistance and Lessons Learned. Lending to the agriculture \nsector did not commence in any significant amount until 1999 when the World Bank approved \nits Farm Privatization Support Project. This project is helping to shape the farm reorganization \nprograms of 10 former state farms and to formulate policies and procedures that could be \napplied to the country as a whole. In 2000, the World Bank approved the Rural Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  Project,  which  will  be  implemented  in  the  same  locations  as  the  Farm \nPrivatization Support Project as the World Bank found that defective irrigation facilities are a \nsignificant constraint to farm reorganization. Other significant funding sources are the Aga Khan \nFoundation, European Union, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  World  Food  Program.  Given  the \ncircumstances in Tajikistan since 1994, most assistance has been relatively quick disbursing for \npriority reconstruction and rehabilitation, emergencies, and structural adjustment. ADB has \napproved two emergency loans relating to agriculture. ADB\u2019s Emergency Restoration of Yavan \nWater Conveyance System Project is ADB\u2019s ongoing emergency assistance being executed by \nMWRLR. The current status of its implementation is satisfactory. Useful experience has been \ngained in administering the Yavan project, particularly with respect to institutional and human \nresources capacity; and design, implementation, and O&M practices. Appendix  2 provides \ninformation on major external assistance related to agriculture. The proposed Project will be the \nfirst ADB loan to Tajikistan\u2019s agriculture sector and incorporates lessons learned from the ADB \ncountry program and the World Bank projects in the same sector. \n \nA\np\np\n                                                  e\nn\n6   Government of Tajikistan. 2000.

The objectives of the Project are to (i)  improve living conditions of the project area \nfarming  communities,  and  (ii)  institute  measures  to  sustain  benefits  of  improvements \nimplemented under the Project. The Project\u2019s target is to reduce poverty in the project area from \n88% to 43%. The project objectives will be achieved through (i) enhanced crop yields brought \nabout by improved irrigation supplies and drainage as a result of infrastructure improvements; \n(ii) access to improved potable water, which will reduce efforts in fetching water and improve \nhealth  standards;  (iii)  building  of  the  capacity  of  the  water  resources  institutions,  and \norganization and training of WUAs and water and sanitation councils (WSCs); and (iv) transfer \nof  management  of  the  irrigation,  drainage,  and  potable  water  supply  systems  to  the \nbeneficiaries  after  they  are  adequately  trained  to  manage  them.  Achievement  of  these \nobjectives will be monitored and sustainability  ensured by transfer of management of the \nimproved systems to the beneficiaries.  Infrastructure rehabilitation will result in improved and \nreliable irrigation and potable water supply and drainage services which, with agriculture support \nservices and capacity building and a under favorable policy environment, will increase farm \nyields and family incomes. This will lead to improved standard of living and reduced poverty. \nProper O&M arrangements and cost recovery will ensure sustained benefits. \n \n21.  The proposed project area comprises three major irrigation systems; (i) Khojabakirgan \nirrigation system in Sughd region, (ii) Vakhsh irrigation system in the Kurgan-Tyube area of \nKhatlon region, and (iii) Kyzylsu-Yakhsu irrigation system in Kulyab area of Khatlon region. The \nselection of the project systems was based on critical need for immediate intervention, potential \nfor development, economic returns, and regional balance. The Project will directly benefit an \nirrigation service area of 85,000 ha and 471,500 people. The improvement in main diversion \nworks will indirectly benefit an additional irrigation service area of 67,500 ha and additional \n359,000 people. Project locations are shown on the Map. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n22.  The Project has the following components: (i) agriculture support services for dehkan \nfarms; (ii) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems and related institutional support; (iii) \nimprovement of potable water supply systems; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and \nevaluation. The proposed interventions are being pilot-tested under the ongoing Tajikistan Rural \nPoverty Reduction Project financed by Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.7 The experience \ngained  will  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  before  large-scale  replication  under  the  proposed \nProject. A  detailed description of project components is given in Supplementary Appendix  A \nwhile a brief description of the components follows. \n \n1.  Agriculture Support Services for Dehkan Farms \n23.  This component is primarily for newly-organized dehkan farms and was developed on \nfarmers\u2019 demand analysis. It consists of the following three programs: (i) farm demonstrations \non soil fertility and crop husbandry, (ii) promotion of improved seeds, and (iii) establishment of \nthree FMUs. Each program will be tailored to the specific needs of that system and will be \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2001.

The farming entities involved should \nalso be largely free of debt in order to have the flexibility to promote or implement the program.  \n \n24.  Within each pilot area, the demonstration subprogram will undertake a set of activities \ndesigned to illustrate the benefits of (i) soil fertility improvement treatments; and (ii) improved, \nintensified, and diversified cropping technologies. Soil surveys will determine the characteristics \nof each pilot area\u2019s soils, and the treatments required. Treatments may include land leveling, \nleaching, green manure, and drainage according to whether soils are uneven, saline, sandy, or \nwaterlogged. The demonstration plots will promote appropriate crop production technologies \nincluding the use of improved seeds, fertilizers, integrated pest management,8 and other cultural \npractices. This subprogram will be implemented by local research institutes of the Agricultural \nAcademy of Sciences supported by the international research institutes. The staff of the local \ninstitutions and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be closely associated in these activities, \nwhich will build their capacity to continue the activities after project completion. \n \n25.  The seed subprogram will help farmers acquire certified seeds. The local research \ninstitutes will multiply small quantities of selected varieties, clean and calibrate the seeds, and \nsell them to farms in the rehabilitated irrigation systems. The technologies to be introduced \ncould be funded out of the farmers\u2019 personal resources or the existing credit channels. \n \n26.  The Project will, through subsidiary loan agreements, provide $1.0 million to each of the \nthree FMUs, one in each project system, to finance their establishment and the required \nmachinery, civil works, workshop facilities for maintenance and repair, office equipment, and \ntraining. Madad9 shall provide technical support: (i) to the project management office (PMO) for \nselection and procurement of farm machinery; (ii) in establishing FMUs; and (iii) to the FMUs, \nonce they are established, in setting up their procedures on operation, repair, and maintenance \nof the farm machinery. The FMUs will be established initially as state-owned commercial entities \nusing facilities and staff of selected existing FMUs. The local technicians will be trained by the \nsuppliers in repair and maintenance of the procured farm machinery. Their equity stakes will, \nhowever, be gradually offered to the public and by project completion, their majority stakes will \nbe sold to the private sector through regional and central branches of Tajik Universal Goods and \nRaw Materials Exchange by project completion date. The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk and will charge interest rate to cover the administrative charges and  foreign \nexchange risk. The FMUs will provide farm machinery services to dehkan farms and collect \nservice charges determined on a commercial basis. Details are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2.  Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems and Institutional Support \n27.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage facilities of three systems \ncovering about 85,000 ha, provide for capacity building so MWRLR can meet the demands of its \nchanged role as service provider, and organize and train an estimated 30 WUAs. During \nimplementation,  pumped  irrigation  areas  will  be  scrutinized  to  exclude  those  which  are \n                                                 \n8   Integrated pest management is a pest control approach that uses regular monitoring to determine if and when \ntreatments are needed and employs physical, mechanical, cultural, biological, and educational tactics to keep pest \nnumbers low enough to prevent intolerable damage or annoyance.

Simple civil works requiring unskilled labor will be \nimplemented through a food-for-work program (para. 46) \n \na.  Interfarm Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation \n28.  The Project will rehabilitate diversion works, pumping units, canals, drainage collectors, \nand infrastructure protection works within the following project systems. \n \n29.  Khojabakirgan Irrigation and Drainage System. The system was designed as a pump \nirrigation system. However, the initial construction did not lead to full development of the \nrequired irrigation and drainage system. The following works are proposed: (i) at Kairakum \nReservoir, provision of a pontoon including installation of 8 link pipes and replacement of pumps \nat two pump stations; (ii) replacement of 8,720 meter (m) of pressure pipelines; (iii) protection \nworks to safeguard the siphon on the canal; (iv) replacement of cross regulator gates (20); (v) \ndesilting of collector drain reaches; (vi) desilting of inter-farm canal reaches; (vii) rehabilitation of \ncanal linings; (viii) rehabilitation/replacement of drainage pumps and other  facilities; and (ix) \nrehabilitation, repair, and extension of downstream transitions for selected critical canals and \ndrainage structures. \n \n30.  Vakhsh Irrigation and Drainage System. The key structures of the system are in \nimminent danger of collapse, which would leave large areas without water supply. To arrest the \nsituation, the Project will (i) repair canal head works and cross regulator structures of the main \ncanals;  (ii)  replace  20  interfarm  canal  off-take  structures;  (iii)  rehabilitate  and  repair the \nembankment of part of the Ak-Gaza canal including field investigation to control seepage losses \nthrough embankment; (iv) rehabilitate canal linings on 18 canals; (v) desilt critical reaches of 25 \ninterfarm canals; (vi) desilt selected reaches of 30 collector drains; (vii) rehabilitate/replace \ndrainage pumps and other facilities; and (viii) rehabilitate, repair, and extend embankment \nprotections and downstream transitions for approximately 80 canals and drainage structures. \n \n31.  Kyzylsu-Yakhsu Irrigation and Drainage System. The proposed rehabilitation works \nwill include (i) diversion structures on the Kyzylsu River and related main canal head works, (ii) \ncross regulators and off-take structures, (iii) repair of canal linings on selected reaches of 17 \ncanals, (iv) replacement of 10 turbine pumps, (v) desilting of critical reaches of 25 interfarm \ncanals, (vi) desilting of critical reaches of 16 collector drains, (vii) relocation of a drainage culvert \nin railway embankment, (viii) rehabilitation and repair of the Selbur reservoir embankment to \ncontrol seepage, and (ix) rehabilitation and replacement of drainage pumps and other facilities. \n \nb.  Support to Water Resources Management Agencies \n32.  MWRLR, with its region- and district-level organizations, is the agency with overall \nresponsibility for the water sector. In addition, MWRLR incorporates Selkhozvodoprovodstroy, \nthe agency responsible for constructing rural potable water supply networks and for the O&M of \nthese networks. The Project will assist these agencies\u2019 transition to a market-orientated culture \nby providing training in the planning and allocation of water resources based on meeting \nfinancial and environmental criteria, including cost recovery mechanisms. The activities will \ninclude help in redefining and realigning roles and responsibilities and in introducing procedures \nfor better O&M and sustainability of project benefits. The Project will formulate a comprehensive \nlong-term  program  for  development  and  support  of  WUAs,  including  (i)  identification  of \nbudgetary allocations needed for WUA support units at the ministerial, regional, and district \nlevels; and (ii) determination of an overall training program for their staff. The Project will also \nprovide O&M, communications, and office equipment; and irrigation management software. ", "9 \n \nc.  Organization and Training of Water Users\u2019 Associations \n33.  To empower the beneficiaries, particularly the poorer factions, and facilitate sustained \nproject benefits, the Project will support promotion, formation, and training of WUAs in the \nproject area. Priority will be given to parts of the systems that have been privatized and where \ngroups of farmers depend on a common source of water. The Project will ensure that (i) a \ndialogue is established between the target communities and concerned sector agencies with \nrespect to organization of WUAs, (ii) WUAs are organized in a participatory process, and (iii) the \nlevel  and  role  of  female  participation  are  promoted  in  formulation,  organization,  and \nmanagement of WUAs. \n \n34.  Initially, the WUAs would take over management of the tertiary systems. As they gain \nexperience, responsibility of the secondary system will also be delegated to them and by project \ncompletion, they are expected to be handling O&M of all irrigation and drainage facilities of the \nProject.  The  WUAs  will  be  supported  in  (i)  governance  and  administration,  (ii)  financial \nmanagement, (iii) collection of water fees, and (iv) integrated water management. \n \n3.  Improvement of Potable Water Supply Systems \n35.  The Project will support reconstruction of potable water supply systems in selected \ncommunities within the designated irrigation systems\u2019 command areas to serve a total of 87,000 \nbeneficiaries who currently do not get water from a safe source. The selection of villages was \nundertaken during a series of stakeholder workshops using a set of criteria including (i) absence \nof a safe water source, (ii) a high incidence of waterborne diseases, (iii) community willingness \nto participate, and (iv) affordability. Depending on the status of the existing facilities and \nbeneficiaries\u2019 institutional capacity to maintain them, the Project has proposed simple, least-cost \nworks for reconstructing potable water supply systems.  \n \n36.  The proposed works include (i) two boreholes, one reservoir, a pipeline network, 100 \nstandpipes, and power supply and pumps to serve 11,000 people in Kistakuz village in Gafurov \ndistrict; (ii) six boreholes, one reservoir, pipeline network, 134 standpipes, and power supply \nand pumps to serve 13,500 people in Gulkhandoz Jamoat10 in Jabbar Rasulov district; (iii) 225 \nboreholes 45 m deep and handpumps in selected communities of Vakhsh district to serve \n22,500 people, and (iv) 13 boreholes, one reservoir, a pipeline network, 400 standpipes and \npower supply and pumps to serve 40,000 people in Khulbuk, Mahamadaliev, and Yap farms in \nVose district. The project will also facilitate education, training, and social marketing of health \nbenefits of improved standards of sanitation provision. \n \n37.  The project will support transformation of the water distribution networks into community-\nmanaged systems. The project will establish a central support unit within PMO. At the field level, \nexperienced  nongovernmental  organizations11  will  organize  and  support  the  WSCs.

The Project will establish and provide support to a PMO in MWRLR, Dushanbe and \nthree project implementation units (PIUs), one in each project area. Additional support will be \nprovided by consultants, who will train and advise PMO staff. The organizational arrangements \nof the PMO and PIUs are discussed in implementation arrangements (paras. 45-47). \n \n39.  A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit will be established within the PMO to implement \nthe  environmental  monitoring  system  recommended  in  the  Summary  Initial  Environmental \nExamination (Supplementary Appendix C) and to monitor the environmental and social impacts \nof the Project. Specifically, the M&E unit  will be responsible for (i) collecting, collating, and \nanalyzing baseline data relating to the economic, social, environmental, and health conditions \nwithin the project area; (ii) benefit monitoring during project implementation, and (iii) evaluating \nthe project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts within the selected systems. The unit \nwill particularly monitor (i) income opportunities and other resources provided under the Project \nto extremely poor communities and women, (ii) reduction in vulnerability of households to \nwaterborne diseases, and (iii) participation of women in community activities. The M&E unit will \nhave two staff members, who will work with the responsible agencies. For environmental \nmonitoring, they will collect and analyze data relating to the quality of irrigation and drainage \nwater, soil chemistry, and groundwater depth and quality. District-level laboratories will be \nequipped to ensure effective and regular monitoring. Environmental monitoring will provide a \ncomparison of the before and after project situations and a limited comparison between project \nand nonproject areas. The project performance, monitoring, and evaluation will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on its project performance management system. \n \n40.  To monitor the project\u2019s social impact, during the first year of project implementation the \nM&E unit will compile a benchmark database on basic economic and social conditions to \nprovide socioeconomic profile of the beneficiary communities. Key indicators will be tracked \nduring project implementation and a comparison made between the benchmark and project \ncompletion situations. The database will be analyzed to provide an assessment of the Project\u2019s \nimpact on different social groups, including women and the lower income households.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n41.  The Project will help the extremely poor people living in the project area through the \nfood-for-work scheme (para. 46). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n42.  The Project is estimated to cost $43.75 million equivalent, of which $24.43 million (56%) \nis the foreign exchange cost and $19.32 million equivalent (44%) the local currency cost. The \ncost  estimates  include  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  include  taxes  and  duties \namounting to $5.82 million (Table 1).

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n45.  The project management structure has been based largely on the experience gained \nduring implementation of ADB\u2019s ongoing Yavan Project (para 19), also being executed by \nMWRLR. A high-level project steering committee established during project preparation will \ncontinue to function during project implementation to provide policy guidance and facilitate \ninterministerial coordination at the central level. A Working Group, also established to facilitate \noperational coordination of activities involving more than one ministry will continue to work. The \nminister of MWRLR will be designated as project director with overall responsibility for project \nimplementation. A PMO will be established within MWRLR to manage project activities on a \ndaily basis, and to liaise with ADB and the coordinating bodies. Three PIUs, one in each project \narea, will be responsible for project implementation activities in their areas, and maintaining \nliaison  with  the  PMO,  local  administration,  and  beneficiary  organizations.  The  Agriculture \nAcademy of Sciences will implement farm demonstrations on soil fertility and crop husbandry \nand promote improved seeds. The working group shall facilitate operational coordination of \ninterministerial activities at the district level and provide assistance to the PIUs. The PMO will be \nled by a full-time project manager and the PIUs by deputy project managers. The project \nmanager has been nominated by the Government. The deputy project managers and other key \nstaff will be selected on open merit by a panel of experts appointed by the Government and \nagreed by ADB. Staff selected by the Panel will need endorsement by ADB. The organization \nchart for project implementation is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n46.  To assist the extremely poor households, the Project will use food-for-work schemes for \nimplementing simple civil works requiring unskilled workers. These works will mainly pertain to \nrehabilitation of irrigation and drainage facilities and potable water systems. The scheme will \ntarget the extremely poor labor force members in the project communities paying them either in \nfood or the minimum wage equivalent that is prevalent in the area. The local communities or \nother similar local groups will be tapped to identify the target households. Such works will be \nmanaged by PIUs through force account procedures. \n \n47.  The investment activities will be implemented under the full coverage of the United \nNations security services to ensure safety during implementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n48.  The project components will be implemented during 6 years starting in year 2003 \n(Appendix  5).  Project  activities  during  the  first  year  will  concentrate  on  the  fielding  of \nconsultants, procurement of equipment, development of operational systems for PMO and PIUs, \nand training of their staff. The civil works component will be implemented in overlapping \npackages. The packages will be designed to ensure that on-farm, interfarm, and commissioned \ndrainage facilities are completed within each major hydrologic supply and drainage unit in a \nstaged fashion. Field surveys, investigations, and preparation of detailed designs of the civil \nworks of Vakhsh irrigation system will be conducted in the first year. Establishment of WUAs \nand their training will also be initiated in the first year, with most of the activities conducted in \nsecond and third years. For potable water supply, Kulyab zone will be rehabilitated first, \nfollowed by Kistakuz-Gafurov and Gulkhandoz-Rasulov zones. \n ", "13 \n3.  Procurement \n49.  Machinery, equipment, civil works, and services for rehabilitating irrigation, drainage, \nand potable water supply systems; and vehicles, office equipment, and materials required for \nproject  implementation  and  monitoring  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. To the extent possible, the Project will procure similar items in groups to optimize \nvolume  discounts.  Equipment  and  materials  procurement  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive \nbidding. Contracts costing less than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international \nshopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small supply contracts costing less than $100,000 will \nbe procured through direct purchase. The award of contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \n50.  Each civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more will be \nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding among prequalified contractors as \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works packages costing less than $1.0 \nmillion will be carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB. For works whose size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive bidding, \nand if MWRLR has the facilities and capacity to implement these works expeditiously and at a \nreasonable cost, ADB may agree to force account procedures. The works to be implemented \nthrough force account will be determined during implementation. The upper limit for a force \naccount works package will be $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be subject to \napproval  by  ADB.  Poor  communities  will  be  helped  by  their  involvement  in  food-for-work \nprogram (para.  46). A list of equipment and materials to be procured is in Supplementary \nAppendix F and a list of major contract packages is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n51.  The  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  1,951  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  89  person-months  of  international  and  1,862  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants.  To  minimize  the  burden  of  consulting  services  costs,  input  of  international \nconsultants has been kept to a minimum and limited to areas for which local skills are not \nadequate. The consultants will assist MWRLR in (i) agriculture support services; (ii) institutional \ncapacity building; (iii) surveys, design, preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation and \nconstruction supervision; and (iv) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The details \nof consulting services inputs and outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 7, and \ndetailed terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix G. The consulting services will be \nprovided by international consulting firm(s) in association with domestic consulting firm(s) to be \nengaged by MWRLR in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of the domestic consultants and using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  After loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to \nADB, to facilitate the timely release of loan funds for making payments in local currency. During \nthe first year of implementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $500,000. The \nimprest account will be established in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nA\nand other procedures to be agreed on by ADB and the Government. ADB\u2019s statement of  p\np\nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest  e\nn\nd\naccount for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per payment.  ix\n   0 \n1\n3\n   ", "14 \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  MWRLR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used for \nengaging auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. Internal \naudit procedures will be developed in the PMO to improve financial management. \n \n54.  MWRLR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and expected progress \nduring the remaining implementation period. MWRLR will also provide such other reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request, including the Project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts, dialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, MWRLR will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report detailing, among others, information on project implementation, use of the \nloan proceeds, and the extent to which the objectives of the Project have been accomplished. \nThe Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which cover \nfailure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements within the due date. A formal \nwarning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue and disbursements will be \nsuspended for accounts that are more than 12 months overdue. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The Project provides for an elaborate system of performance M&E (paras. 39-40). \n \n8.  Project Review \n56.  The Project will be reviewed regularly by ADB loan review missions. During the third \nyear of its implementation, the Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review to \nassess the achievement of project objectives and implementation milestones. The achievement \nof project objectives will be measured against the performance criteria listed in Appendix 1. The \nparameters for assessing the implementation milestones will include (i) implementation status, \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  made  and  disbursements  in \nrelation to the implementation schedule, (iv) performance of the consultants and contractors, \nand (v) status of compliance with loan covenants. The financial and economic viability of the \nProject will also be reassessed. The midterm review will also assess the need for any additional \nworks or changes in the project scope. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n57.  A grant of $960,000 equivalent financed by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment of Japan will provide the services of 27 person-months of international and 54 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The TA will assist the Government in (i) resolving \naccumulated farm debts; and (ii) promoting, implementing, and monitoring the policy reforms \nparticularly in areas of agriculture marketing and water resources management. The TA will \ndevelop  a  debt  resolution  strategy  after  reviewing  all  contracts  that  have  resulted  in \naccumulated  debts.  Such  analysis  will  help  in  firming  up  the  debt  amounts,  assigning \nresponsibility for debt to various parties, and identifying amounts that need to be written off or \nrescheduled. To help Tajikistan fetch better prices for its cotton, the TA will assist in establishing \nunique grades for Tajikistan cotton that are recognized in the international markets. For rapid ", "15 \npromotion of policy reforms, the TA will launch an information awareness campaign for the \nfarmers. The project areas will serve as case study areas with the intention that conclusions and \nlessons drawn can be replicated elsewhere. Details of the TA are in Appendix 8. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n1.  Financial and Economic Analyses \n58.  Economic and financial analyses were carried out to justify the economic viability of the \nProject and financial viability of the participating farms. Economic analysis was carried out for \nthe core components, which include irrigation and drainage improvements, agricultural support \nservices, and associated institutional support. The main quantifiable benefits of the investment \ncome from the reversal of production decline and increased crop yields and cropping intensity. \nA similar analysis for the potable water supply component has not been carried out due to the \nnature and size of the investment, and lack of a reliable database. Public health statistics are \ndistorted  and  unreliable,  which  might  have  provided  a  basis  for  estimating  the  costs  of \nwaterborne diseases, and the costs of possible interventions can only be roughly approximated \nwithout reference to the hydrological conditions of specific sites. The Project has adopted a \nleast-cost approach in selecting the potable water supply systems to be reconstructed. \n \n59.  Quantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  basically  from  increases  in  agricultural  production, \nwhich will be an accumulative effect of increases in yields, cultivated areas, and cropping \nintensity.  These  improvements  will  result  from  a  higher  level  of and dependable irrigation \nsupplies, better drainage, and adoption of improved technologies. The average cotton yield is \nexpected to increase from 1.5 to 2.4 t/ha and wheat from 1.2 to 2.0 t/ha. Under the Project, the \ncropping  intensity  is  expected  to  increase  from  current  of  100%  to  121%.  Annual  cotton \nproduction in the project area is expected to increase from 66,909 to 131,812 t and wheat from \n42,917 to 69,758 t until year 9 and stabilize thereafter. \n \n60.  The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has been estimated at 22.9% with \nan economic net present value of $29.1 million. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to test \nthe effect of key factors of economic viability. Overall, the Project\u2019s EIRR was rather robust to \nadverse  effects  of  price  and  yield  declines,  project  benefit  delays,  and  investment  cost \nincreases, producing in all cases the EIRR considerably higher than the acceptable minimum \n(12%). Also, to illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, indicative farm models \nfor a large non-dehkan (1,400 ha) and a dehkan farm (17 ha) were developed for each of the \nthree project areas. Significant project impacts are expected on both large (non-dehkan) and \nsmall (dehkan) farms. The net farm incomes are projected to increase until year 9, then to \nstabilize. By year 9, the large farms are estimated to make a net annual income of $186-260/ha, \nand small farms $190-300/ha. Details of the financial and economic analyses are given in \nAppendix 9 and detailed tables are given in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n2.  Impact on Environment \n61.  The Project will have a very positive effect on the project areas environments. The \nA\nProject is designed to alleviate social, economic, environmental, and health problems. It will  p\np\npromote farm privatization and assist the transition to a market-oriented agricultural sector, thus  e\nn\nleading to more efficient management of natural resources. The Project will rehabilitate key  dix\nelements of major irrigation and drainage systems, thereby reducing water losses, increasing   0 \n1\n5\n   ", "16 \napplication efficiencies, and lowering groundwater levels. This will also reduce the risk of \nsecondary salinization and reduce inequities in water distribution. The Project will rehabilitate \nand enhance the potable water supply distribution network and thus facilitate availability of good \nquality potable water to most of the population in the project area. This will improve the health \nand thus the quality of life of the project beneficiaries. Improvements in O&M will lead to \nsustained benefits and will help check environmental degradation. The environmental screening \nprocess has not identified any significant negative environmental impacts likely to be caused by \nthe Project. The summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix C \n \n3.  Impact on Living Standards \na.  Poverty Reduction \n62.  While the main beneficiaries of the Project will be those directly involved in the dehkan \nfarms and the collective farms that will be restructured in the project areas, the benefits accruing \nfrom the Project will redound to the poor residing in these areas. The widespread nature of rural \npoverty in the project sites suggests that poverty reduction can be achieved even without a \nfocus on specific vulnerable social groups in society. Of the total 471,500 rural population in the \nproject area, about 88% are below the poverty line, and most of them have garden plots for their \nsubsistence  requirements  and  have  access  to  irrigation.  For  households  with  inadequate \nirrigation, improved irrigation will enable them to increase their cropping intensity to two or, in \nexceptional cases, three crops in a year and increase in yields by at least 20%. Among the poor \nhouseholds  with  average  spending  of  TJS10-20/family/month  (45%  of  the  total  estimated \nnumber of project beneficiaries), improved productivity and incomes will be sufficient to move \nthem out of poverty. For the extremely poor (43% of project beneficiaries), improved yields in \ntheir homestead plots will augment their meager food resources. Returns to farm labor will \nlikewise increase, with greater positive impact on the dehkan farms. With improved production, \nwage payments of farm workers  will stabilize, hence reducing the uncertainties arising from \nirregular pay schedule. Intensive cropping practices will raise person-day requirements for farm \nlabor and increase demand for casual work by 10-15%. In sum, the Project\u2019s prospective impact \nwill be to reduce poverty incidence from the present 88% to 43%.12 Impoverished people, \nconstituting about 4% of those in the project area, will be greatly benefited by the food-for-work \nscheme (para. 46). The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 10. \n \n63.  During project preparation, many poor households identified access to quality drinking \nwater as one of their primary concerns. In Khojabakirgan, about 25% of the people have access \nto water supply and more than 50% obtain their water from open ditches, 33% from water pipes, \nand less than 5% buy water delivered through tanker trucks. In the Khatlon region, less than \n20% have access to water supply and more than 75% obtain their water from open ditches. \nSome people walk as far as 10 kilometers to collect water for domestic use; in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, \nqueuing for water takes as much as 6 hours. In all these areas, many of the water fetchers are \nchildren and women. Because of the poor quality of potable water, a large proportion of the \nproject area\u2019s population is suffering from waterborne diseases.13 Under the Project, potable \nwater supply systems will be constructed in villages (paras. 35-37) selected by the criteria of \n                                                 \n12  The rural population whose incomes fall just below the poverty threshold, constituting about 45%, will be more \nresponsive to productivity improvements than those who belong to the extremely poor income echelon. \n13   In 2000, majority of villages in the project areas were afflicted by waterborne illnesses, and the proportion of the \npopulation affected is much higher than the national averages. Specifically, typhoid cases in Kolkhozabad were \n182% of the national average; cases of dysentery in J Rasulov and B Gafurov were 110%; diarrhea cases in \nBoktar and Vakhsh were 217%; hepatitis cases in Kolkhozabad, J Rasulov, and B Gafurov were 206%; and for \nmalaria cases were 168% in Boktar, Vakhsh, Kolkhozabad, and Kulyab. ", "17 \nseverity of access to drinking water and impact on the population. The Project will also provide \neducation  and  training  on  health  and  sanitation.  The  project  interventions  will  focus  on \nimproving the health conditions of the poor and vulnerable groups and lessening the burden for \nwomen and children in fetching water. This will enhance their overall quality of life. \n \nb.  Gender and Development \n64.  Aside  from  fetching  water,  women  contribute  in  the  household\u2019s  income  through \noccasional work during harvesting, farming in the garden plots, and performing household \nchores. In Sughd for instance, women comprised about half of the cooperative teams in \nagriculture enterprises, performing strenuous tasks in cotton production activities and obtaining \naverage farm wages. Many men in Khatlon and some in Sughd have left to seek work in the \nlarger cities or abroad, leaving the women to manage the family and the garden plots. With the \nProject, a more reliable water supply will enable output to be increased thereby easing the \nburden of providing the family with an adequate diet. A gender strategy and plan with specific \ngender targets has been prepared (Appendix 10). \n \nc.  Improved Rural Institutions \n65.  The project is focused on enabling poor rural communities to acquire greater control \nover the water supplies, which influence in large measure their standard of living. The Project \nwill  facilitate  the  creation  of  rural  institutions  (WUAs  and  WSCs)  that  will  empower  the \nbeneficiary  communities  to  manage  irrigation  and  potable  water  supplies,  organize  water \ndistribution, and arrange O&M of their systems. Stakeholder participation will assure more \nefficient and effective allocation of the scarce water resource in a sustainable manner, which \ncan  serve  as  a  stepping  stone  for  the  establishment  of  community-based  governance \nmechanisms that will catalyze for more local and specific development undertakings. The \ntraining of MWRLR staff will create efficient and effective service providers responsive to the \nneeds of its clients. They will work closely with the WUAs and WSCs in ensuring that the water \nresources are properly allocated and utilized, that the facilities are maintained in a sustainable \nmanner,  and  that  water-related  problems  are  addressed  in  a  participatory  fashion.  The \nsynergistic relationship between the rural institutions and the government agency will help \nimprove the agriculture sector\u2019s growth performance in the project areas and reduce poverty. \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n66.  The project activities will be subject to a number of natural and country-specific risks. \nThe country is prone to periodic earthquakes and flooding. Very little can be done about the \nformer, but efforts are being made to mitigate the impact of flooding.14 The project sites were \nselected with particular attention to avoid the undue risks of these natural calamities. \n \n67.  Accumulated  farm  debts  are  also  considered  as  a  major  risk,  affecting  farmers\u2019 \nproduction incentives and financial sustainability of many cotton farms. The issue of farm debts \nis complex and requires  a careful approach in addressing associated issues encompassing \ninput and output marketing, rural financing, farm restructuring policies, and governance. ADB is \nassisting the Government  to  address  these  issues  in a judicious and transparent manner \nthrough  participatory  dialogue  with  stakeholders,  including  farmers,  private  investors,  local \nA\nadministrations, and central government authorities. The Government is committed to resolve  p\np\ne\nn\n                                                  d\n14 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Strategy for Improved Flood Management Project. Manila. The  ix 0\n \nTA was completed in December 2001. \n1\n7\n   ", "18 \nthe issues, and has decided to create a high-level task force to develop a debt resolution \nstrategy and identify other relevant policy and legislative actions. The Project\u2019s associated TA \nwill assist the task force.  \n \n68.  The possibility of renewed civil conflict remains but is receding as the peace accord is \nsustained. A proportion of the river flow supplying the Khojabakirgan irrigation system emanates \nfrom Kyrgystan and its flows are subject to control by the Kyrgyz authorities. The water share is, \nhowever,  protected  by  the  water  agreement  among  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  it  is \nexpected that the agreement will be respected. \n \n69.  Tajikistan\u2019s agencies associated with agriculture sector have been involved during the \nlast 3 years with the World Bank\u2019s ongoing Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project in policy \nreforms involving long-term complex processes. The proposed Project will be the ADB\u2019s first \nmajor  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  the  second  with  MWRLR.15  The  risk  of \nimplementation delays arising from MWRLR\u2019s unfamiliarity with ADB procedure has been partly \nmitigated by involving MWRLR staff during project processing. Their knowledge of ADB\u2019s \nprocedures will be enhanced through seminars and during the administration missions. \n \n70.  At the project level, the benefits of the investment will be much reduced if (i) the farm \nprivatization process is delayed, (ii) old farm management practices and administrative controls \nover production and marketing are not eliminated, or (iii) the marketing arrangements for cotton \nare not improved. In general, the informal barriers to trade and to a fair return to the producer \nmust be significantly reduced if farmers are to achieve any measurable benefit from growing \ncotton. These issues are being addressed under the policy reforms being implemented.  \n \n71.  Sustainability of the project benefits will be threatened if proper O&M arrangements are \nnot in place and/or the beneficiaries fail to meet the O&M costs after the 10 year transition \nperiod. This failure may result from an improper legal framework, inadequate organization and \ntraining of the WUAs and WSCs or inadequate capacity of the beneficiaries to pay. The system \nbenefits could also be reduced if the project systems are not maintained properly. All these \naspects  are  being  addressed  under  the  Project,  and  appropriate  assurances  have  been \nobtained  from  the  Government.  Details  of  the  proposed  O&M  arrangements  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MWRLR  have  given \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  With the assistance provided under the associated TA, the Government will (a) \ndevelop necessary policies and implement relevant regulatory, legislative, and \nadministrative measures required to resolve accumulated farm debts, and (b) \nmonitor the progress on policy reforms implementation. \n(ii)  The Government and the regional- and district-level administrations will ensure \nthat the Presidential Decrees 896 of 20 September 2002 exempting the 2002 \n                                                 \n15 The first project was the Yavan Project: ADB. 2001.

", "19 \ncotton crop from value added tax; and 899 of 23 September 2002 abolishing \ncotton balances and thus reducing local administrations\u2019 control over farming \ndecisions, terminating monopoly of Agroinvest Bank, and giving farmers free \nchoice of investors; and Resolution 421 of 22 October 1999 giving farmers \nchoice of trading raw cotton, are properly enforced and implemented throughout \nthe country. \n(iii)  The power supplies will be made available, when needed, for the pumping \nsystems of the rehabilitated irrigation and drainage facilities. The Government will \ntake  appropriate  measures,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  to  recover  the  costs \nassociated with such supplies. \n(iv)  During project implementation, the PMO and PIUs will be provided with adequate \nstaff, office premises, and resources for their effective operation. \n(v)  The Government will establish three FMUs, initially as state-owned enterprises, \nbut will gradually offer their equity stakes to the public with the intention that by \nproject completion their majority shares will be owned by the private sector. \n(vi)  The Government shall ensure that (a) the FMUs operate on commercial basis \nand rent their machinery against a service fee determined at commercial rates, \nand (b) service fees are used for repayment of their respective subsidiary loans \nand towards administrative costs, and O&M cost of the machinery. \n(vii)  The Government shall, in consultation with ADB, develop a program for recovery \nof O&M costs of the irrigation and drainage systems rehabilitated under the \nProject on a phased basis over a period of 10 years in accordance with the \nrelevant Government policies and existing agreements with the International \nDevelopment  Association.  The  Government  shall  review  the  collection  rates \nannually and report to ADB, taking also into account the inkind payments. \n(viii)  Adequate annual budgetary allocations will be made and funds released on a \ntimely basis for O&M of the rehabilitated irrigation and drainage systems, in \nparticular for the primary infrastructure such as reservoirs and large interstate \ncanals, until these costs have been recovered from the beneficiaries. \n(ix)  The Government will take into account the recommendations of the associated \nTA and take all necessary action to ensure that within 1 year of the completion of \nthe TA, the regulatory framework and administrative measures are in place to \nenable effective functioning of the WUAs and WSCs. \n(x)  The Government shall ensure that (a) a dialogue is established between the \ntargeted  communities  and  the  concerned  sector  agencies  with  respect  to \norganization of WUAs; (b) WUAs are organized through a participatory process; \nand (c) the level and role of female participation is promoted in formulation, \norganization, and management of WUAs. \n(xi)  The  Government  will  transfer  operation  and  management  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage facilities and local potable water supply systems to the WUAs and \nWSCs, respectively, after they are fully organized and trained, but not later than \n2 years after rehabilitation of their infrastructure is complete. \n(xii)  The village water networks will remain in public ownership but their operation and \nmanagement will be taken over by WSCs not later than 1 year after rehabilitation \nof their infrastructure is complete. \n(xiii)  The  Project  will  be  carried  out,  and  all  facilities  constructed,  operated, \nmaintained, and monitored, in accordance with the existing laws, regulations, and \nA\nstandards of the Government concerning environmental protection and ADB\u2019s  p\np\ne\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources  n\nd\nDevelopment Projects and the relevant guidelines for irrigation and water supply  ix\n 0\nprojects.   \n1\n9\n   ", "20 \n(xiv)  The Borrower will ensure that an appropriate budgetary allocation is made for \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  by  MWRLR  and  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection, including for vehicles, materials and equipment, and \noperating expenses relating to all environmental management and monitoring \naspects  of  the  Project,  as  specified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination \nreport. \n(xv)  The Borrower will ensure the implementation of the gender strategy and plan with \nspecific targets. The Borrower will (a) identify, within 1 year of loan effectivity, \nproject interventions that will increase women\u2019s access to income opportunities \nand reduce their vulnerability to waterborne diseases; and (b) ensure that women \nwould be given equal opportunities in community activities. \n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that involuntary resettlement under the Project, if \nany, including loss of use of land, other resources or assets, is undertaken in \nconformity with a resettlement plan to be promptly prepared by the Government \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Resettlement Handbook. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n73.  The Government agreed that no disbursement will be permitted for (i) improvement of \npotable water supply systems in a specific area until the WSC for that area has been organized \nand a potable water supply agreement signed between Selkhozvodoprovodstroy and the WSC \non behalf of the community and specifying involvement of the community, and (ii) relending to \nthe FMUs until the Borrower shall have entered into subsidiary loan agreements with FMUs on \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n74.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  26,482,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Agriculture \nRehabilitation Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n21 November 2002 \n ", "Appendix 1  21 \n     \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets \nGoal       \nReduce poverty in the  Poverty incidence in  National and regional  \u2022  Government commitment to \nproject area systems on a  project areas reduced  statistics and sample surveys  market reforms continues \nsustainable basis  from 88% to 43%   \u2022  Risk of the recurrence of \ncivil strife \nPurpose       \n\u2022  Improve living  \u2022  Farm incomes  \u2022  Baseline and impact  \u2022  The Government maintains \nconditions of the project  increased on 85,000  monitoring surveys  appropriate market economy \narea farming communities   hectare (ha) directly  \u2022  Poverty monitoring  policies \n\u2022  Institute measures to  benefiting about 471,500  surveys  \u2022  Consultants recruited \nsustain benefits of  people   \u2022  Monitoring and evaluation  promptly; and they are able to \nimprovements  \u2022  Access to improved  reports  establish good working \nimplemented under the  potable water provided to  \u2022  Loan review missions  relationships with counterparts \nProject  87,000 people living in  \u2022  Project completion report  \u2022  Risk of failure to establish an \nrural areas    economic environment \n\u2022  Incidence of  conducive to agriculture \nwaterborne diseases  production and marketing of \nreduced in the project  commodities \nareas  \u2022  Risk that the benefits of \n\u2022  Management of  rehabilitated irrigation and \nirrigation systems  drainage (I&D), and water \ntransferred to 30 water  supply infrastructure will not be \nusers\u2019 associations  sustained  \n(WUAs)  \n\u2022  Capacity of Ministry of \nWater Resources and \nLand Reclamation \n(MWRLR) strengthened \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Overview \n1.  Average annual production of cotton has been around 350,000 ton (t), but output in 2001 \nincreased to  452,000 t due to expanded crop area and improved yield. Cotton yields had \ndeclined markedly from the preindependence average of more than 2 t/hectare (ha) to the \n1997\u20132001 average of 1.52 t/ha. However, cotton yields significantly improved to 1.76 t/ha in \n2001, due to favorable weather and use of adequate and timely agricultural inputs.  \n2.  Present legislation allows farmers to grow the crop of their choice; there are no state \norders. In practice, cotton production remains highly controlled, especially at the local level. \nLocal administrations, if necessary, are able to ensure that a given area grows cotton and \nallocate resources and inputs to the specific farms. \nB.  Production, Processing, and Marketing \n3.  Tajikistan was a major suppliers of cotton fiber to the former Soviet economy. After \nindependence in 1991 and the collapse of the command economy, Tajikistan\u2019s cotton lost both \nits market and source of financing of production. To keep cotton production, the Government \nprovided direct credit to the state farms, through the National Bank of Tajikistan. The practice \nwas obviously not sustainable due to the country\u2019s weak fiscal capacity, and was terminated in \n1996  according  to  the  agreement  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  In  1997,  the \nGovernment entered into an agreement to borrow and guarantee a syndicated loan from a \nbanking consortium led by Credit Suisse First Boston with the support of P. Reinhart, the world\u2019s \nsecond largest cotton trader. This was augmented by credits from other foreign financiers and \njoint venture trading companies. Reinhart has a majority shareholding in Tajikistan\u2019s principal \nagriculture bank, Agroinvest, which channels the funds to cotton growers through a number of \nlocal  intermediary  companies  called  \u201cinvestors.\u201d  Investors  work  closely  with  local \nadministrations. Initially 35 investors were registered with the Cotton Exchange but now only 16 \nare active in business. At present Agroinvest Bank assigns investors to work in specific districts. \nFarmers enter into annual production contracts with the investor, which generally recovers the \nloan through acquisition of a proportion of the crop.  \n4.  Tajikistan is said to have 27 cotton ginneries but information is available for only 23. Of \nthe 23 ginneries, 20 have been privatized and the Government plans to private the remaining 3 \nin 2003. The ginneries have a range of shareholders; the Ministry of Agriculture is said to have \nretained 25% of shares in each ginnery. Some investors own ginneries, with one investor \nowning five of them. There are inherent monopolistic tendencies in cotton ginning, especially \nwhere  there  is  only  one  ginnery  in  a  district.  Ginneries  have  complete  control  over  the \nspecifications of the quantity and quality of cotton fiber produced by their suppliers. There is no \nindependent assessor to whom farmers can turn if they are not satisfied with the ginneries\u2019 data. \nLegislation allows free movement and export of raw cotton, but in practice this is not always the \ncase. Transport costs are a factor but some local administrations prefer that raw cotton be \nprocessed locally to ensure that maximum use is made of local processing facilities \n5.  About  30%  of  the  cotton  produced  is  consumed  in  the  domestic  market  and  the \nremaining 70% is exported through Riga, Latvia, with P. Reinhart acting as the main exporter, \ncatering for about 95% of the cotton export. The marketing of cotton is regulated by the Tajik \nUniversal Goods and Raw Materials Exchange. The exchange issues the necessary export \ncertificates and verifies that the price paid in the contract is in accordance with its regulations. ", "Appendix 3  27 \n     \nThe local \u201cborder price\u201d is kept to within 5% of the international price based upon the Liverpool \nCotton Exchange daily prices. The exchange holds weekly auctions for cotton but the amounts \nauctioned remain small (less than 5,000 t annually) because the amount of \u201cfree\u201d cotton (that \nnot linked to credit agreements) remains small.  \nC.  Farm Debt \n6.  Profitability of cotton declined significantly in the recent years, due to low international \nmarket  prices  and  low  yields  resulting  from  untimely  and  inadequate  inputs,  inadequate \nirrigation supplies, soil salinization, and a high water table because of poor drainage. The \noriginal  syndicated  loan  of  $60  million  that  the  Government  borrowed  in  1997  from  an \ninternational banking consortium (para. 3) was not fully repaid and has since become an \nannually rolled over financing facility for cotton production. The outstanding debt to this facility \ngrew appreciably during 1997-1999 but the rate of  increase has moderated over the past 2 \nyears.  \n7.  The cotton crop requires about $65 million annually in working capital, of which about \n8% is estimated to come from farmers own resources. Thus farmers need to borrow about $60 \nmillion annually in working capital. The cost of funds to Agroinvest Bank is about LIBOR+8% or \napproximately  10%  at  current  interest  rates.  Agroinvest  Bank  lends  to  the  local  investor \ncompanies at interest rates of 12%/annum. The local investors do not charge a specific margin \nbut  use  several  mechanisms  to  cover  their  administration  and  funding  costs,  including  a \ncommission on the provision of inputs, control of ginning margins, and control of the amount of \nfiber returned or assigned to the farmer. \n8.  This financing system is extremely expensive for the farmer who remains the beneficiary \nof last resort. In effect, the producer is at the end of a financing chain, which ensures that all \nthose involved are paid before the producer. As a result of low yields and low international \ncotton prices, there are not sufficient resources in the system to enable everyone to achieve a \nreasonable return on their investment. Consequently, farms are accumulating debt. About \n20,000 t of cotton, which is about 3-4% of the production at state and collective farms, remains \nunharvested because of the lack of farm machinery and incentives among workers. The annual \ncotton subsector revenues in 2001 were approximately $111.2 million based on that year\u2019s \ncotton output and prices. From this amount, a total of $54.2 million is claimed by creditors, \nincluding interest on debt. This leaves a residual amount of $57.0 million to cover all farm \nproduction costs. However, the total amount of finance used by cotton growers in 2001 is \nestimated at $65.0 million, leaving a deficit of about $8.0 million or $30/ha of cotton. These \nfigures relate to a relatively good production year when the average cotton yield was 1.8 t/ha. In \nprevious years, average yields have been as low as 1.3 t/ha. Thus, the explanation for the debt \nis a combination of factors, the most important of which is the relatively low productivity levels. \nAn average yield of 2.5 t/ha instead of 1.8 t/ha would enable the subsector to become self-\nfinancing. However, this is almost a 50% increase in productivity. To achieve this will require a \nmajor investment and significant structural changes within the agriculture sector. The current \nsituation is also influenced by low world cotton prices and the high cost of funds to the farmer. \n9.  The cost of finance to the farmer is difficult to assess precisely, but it is estimated to be \nin the region of 21% annual interest rate in dollar terms after allowing for all charges and \nA\ncommissions. Farmers generally complain of late delivery of agricultural inputs, particularly  p\np\nfertilizers, and delays in payments for labor, particularly for cotton picking, which is due after the  e\nn\ninvestors take possession of the produce and are, therefore, least concerned to pay. With the  dix\n2001 international price of cotton fiber at $957/t, the Tajik farm gate price of raw cotton, after   3\n \n2\n7\n   ", "28  Appendix 3 \naccounting for local storage and transport and ginning cost, is estimated at $193/t or about 20% \nof the international price of fiber. This implies that the farm will be responsible for taxes other \nthan sale tax, cost of funds, interest on debts, and utility bills. \n10.  The system of cotton balances is prepared by local administrations and is based upon \nan assessment of the amount of the debt, which the cotton subsector will be required to repay in \na given season. The total debt \u201cbill\u201d is translated into a required area of cotton within a region or \ndistrict assuming certain productivity levels. This target area is allocated to farmers. The farmers \nwithout commercial debts are obligated only for their public sector charges. \n11.  Countrywide, the accumulated debt of this facility at the end of 2001 was approximately \n$67 million, owed to Agroinvest Bank. In addition, farms have debt to a number of public sector \nagencies. The national level debts of $91.5 million pertain to about 70% of the irrigated land. \nFarm debt varies from about $100/ha to more than $2,000/ha, averaging about $300/ha, which \nis  roughly  equivalent  to  one  year  of  cotton  revenues.  Servicing  this  debt  costs  at  least \n$36/ha/year. This is a significant element of total farm cost of production. Farms covering about \n40,000-50,000 ha area have enough resources and don\u2019t need production loans. \nD.  A Plan for Recovery \n12.  At  the  Government\u2019s  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  arranged  in \nDushanbe on 8 and 9 October 2002 the Roundtable on Farm Debts and Farm Investment \nOpportunities. A large number of stakeholders, including farmers, local authorities, investors, \ncentral  government  officials,  nongovernmental  organization  and  external  funding  agencies, \nparticipated in the discussions. \n13.  Candid and open discussions among the stakeholders, conducted for the first time in \nTajikistan, resulted in identification of number of problem areas. These included: (i) inadequate, \nand sometimes unfair contracts executed between investors and farmers, both of which often \nlack crucial financial/business management capacities;  (ii) lack of  a clear farm privatization \npolicy, particularly relating to transfer of accumulated farm debts; (iii) lack of alternative rural and \nmicro credit facilities; (iv) inadequacy of the existing collateral law, which does not allow trading \nof the land-use certificate, and as a result, severely constrains the credit-worthiness of farms; (v) \nand the decreasing yield and increasingly erratic and uncertain irrigation water supply due to \ndeteriorating irrigation systems. \n14.  Stakeholders\u2019 discussions resulted in several general agreements, including (i) the need \nto writeoff or reschedule debts to Government agencies, such as utility bills; (ii) the need to \nnegotiate  with  investors  to  reschedule  the  accumulated  debts  based  on  mutually  agreed \nbusiness and farm production plans, which need to be prepared for each farm; (iii) capacity \nbuilding for improved farm management and stricter financial management of heavily indebted \nfarms; (iv) measures to accelerate production increases for farms without heavy debts; and (v) \npromotion of public awareness of farmers\u2019 rights and available options to modify the production \ncontracts, including provision of preproduction credit in cash, sale of raw cotton, etc. \n15.  The roundtable discussions were concluded with a specific recommendation for the \nGovernment to establish a special task force to (i) develop a debt resolution strategy, including \nexamining the debt amounts in various categories (e.g., principal, interest, and penalties), and \nidentifying directed credit, if any, and violations of the contract terms on either party, and (ii) \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  based  on  the  consensus  and \nrecommendations  at  the  roundtable  discussions.  The  Government  accepted  the ", "Appendix 3  29 \n     \nrecommendations, and subsequently requested ADB to provide technical assistance to support \nthe  task  force  (Appendix  8,  Technical  Assistance  for  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy \nReforms). \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 3\n \n2\n9\n   ", " \n3\n0\n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n  A\np\n  Table A4.1: Expenditure Accounts by Financiers pe\nn\n  d\n($ '000) ix\n   4\n \nItem Source Foreign Local Duties\nBeneficiaries Govt. of Tajikistan ADB Total Exchange (Excl. &\nAmount % Amount % Amount % Amount % Taxes) Taxes\nA.

Introduction \n1.  Economic and financial analyses were carried out to justify the economic viability of the \nProject and financial viability of the participating farms. In general, comparisons of costs and \nbenefits in the analysis of projects are made on the basis of quantifiable physical inputs and \noutputs. Incremental net benefits are estimated, where possible, on the basis of the changes \nexpected to occur and other conditions expected to prevail within targeted geographic areas (i) \nin  the  absence  of  the  proposed  project\u2019s  interventions,  and  (ii)  as  a  consequence  of \nimplementing the proposed interventions. For the economic analysis these quantifiable inputs \nand outputs are valued according to their border price equivalents. For the financial analysis, \nestablished prices are applied as determined by local markets. \n2.  The  principal  objective  of  the  economic  analysis  is  to  establish  whether  proposed \ninvestments are profitable for the economy as a whole, which is determined when the net \npresent value of costs and benefits are positive when discounted at the opportunity cost of \ncapital. \n3.  The irrigation component particularly lends itself to quantitative analysis based on the \nexpected performance of agricultural production dependent upon the infrastructure of the three \nschemes under consideration. In addition to farm level costs, the project costs associated with \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, agricultural machinery services, support to establishments of water \nusers\u2019 associations and project management and monitoring costs have been included in the \neconomic and financial analysis. For the whole project analysis, crop and area-wide farm \nbudgets have been estimated for each proposed scheme, then aggregated at the project level.  \n4.  The economic analysis has been carried out in two stages. The first stage is concerned \nwith the economic viability of selected crops in two settings, one without the project and the \nother with project interventions. These are assessed using economic crop budgets for the two \nsituations. The second stage is the determination of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \nThis requires the aggregation of the results of the budgetary analyses weighted according to the \nprojected cropping patterns. The EIRR of the Project is based on the incremental benefits \nresulting from project interventions. \n5.  A similar analysis of the potable water supply component is not possible due to the \nnature of the activity and the data available for an assessment. Not only are public health \nstatistics distorted and unreliable, which might have provided a basis for estimating the costs of \nwaterborne  diseases,  the  costs  of  possible  interventions  themselves  can  only  be  roughly \napproximated  without  reference  to  the  hydrological  conditions  of  specific  sites.  The  best \napproach in this case is to present a least-cost argument that, given the information available at \nthe time of the preparation, the proposed investment options in terms of cost per beneficiary are \ncomparable to norms of similar water supply investments elsewhere.  \n6.  Also, to illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, indicative farm models \nfor a large non-dehkan1 (1,400 hectare [ha]) and a dehkan farm (17 ha) were developed for \neach of the three project areas. \nA\np\np\n                                                  e\nn\n1  A dehkan farm is a privately-managed farm. Currently, an average nondehkan (cooperative) farm has about 1,400  dix\nha of cultivated land. However, as a result of the ongoing process of farm reorganization, dehkan farms are   9\n \nemerging at the expense of cooperative farms\u2019 land. The average size of dehkan farm is to be around 17 ha. \n4\n5\n   ", "46  Appendix 9 \n \nB.  Land Area, Cropping Pattern, and Yields \n7.  The total project area in the three regions covers approximately 85,000 ha of irrigated \nland and has approximately 471,500 beneficiaries. The two major crops in the project area\u2014\ncotton and wheat\u2014annually use around 50% and 39% of the irrigated cropland, respectively. \nOn the remaining 11% of irrigated cropland, several minor crops including fodder, vegetables, \nand fruits are planted. Depending on particular regions and individual irrigation systems, the \ncurrent crop yields in the project area vary considerably: for cotton, between 0.7 and 1.8 tons \n(t)/ha and for wheat, 0.8 and 2.0 t/ha. \nC.  Major Assumptions \n8.  Many large farms in the project area are unprofitable and have significant debt, partly \ndue to their inability to repay production loans. With the resolution of debts, the large farms are \nlikely to reorganize into dehkan farms able to make their own farming decisions. The Project will \nfacilitate resolution of the debts and the reorganization process and thereby creating equal \nopportunities for land allocations. \n9.  Many farms, particularly the large ones, have been unprofitable in recent years caused \nby (i) declining crop productivity due to deteriorating conditions of the irrigation and drainage \nsystems, (ii) multiple and high taxes, and (iii) low and unstable prices for their crops.  \n10.  With the Project, crop yields are expected to increase progressively for 9 years: (i) cotton \nfrom 1.5 to 2.4 t/ha, (ii) wheat from 1.2 to 2.0 t/ha. Without the Project, crop yields are expected \nto decline to 1.2 t/ha for cotton and 1.0 t/ha for wheat. In addition, a significant loss in irrigated \narea is expected under the without the Project The projected yield improvements are relatively \nmodest  since  the  rehabilitation  will  focus  on  improving  of  primary  and  secondary  canals. \nHowever, since the Project will be providing agricultural support services on 6,000 ha on a pilot \nbasis, the projected yield increases are expected to be modest and to take effect gradually. No \nyield improvements are assumed until year 5, when many of the rehabilitation works will be \ncomplete. \n11.  With the Project, the cropping intensity is expected to increase from 100% to 121%. This \nassumption varies between subproject sites, depending on the current situation and feasibility of \nfuture  irrigation.  For  instance,  with  the  Project,  the  cropping  intensity  in  Khojabakirgan  is \nexpected to increase by 31%, in Vakhsh by 15% and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu by 13%. \n12.  Without the Project, the current levels of inputs are likely to continue to be used over an \nessentially declining areas of adequately irrigated land and the cost of energy will remain at its \ncurrent low level. However, with the Project, the farmers are expected to increase their use of \nfertilizers and adopt integrated pest management techniques. With the Project, the introduction \nof short-season varieties of oilseeds, maize, and pulses will encourage the growing of two crops \nper year where the water resources are adequate. These crops are grown already on household \nplots and on some farms but the varieties are old and not suitable for more intensive cropping \nsystems. The introduction of better varieties with shorter growing seasons will produce more \nbalanced crop rotations and will provide an opportunity for farms to increase incomes to help \nmeet the increased cost of irrigation system operation and maintenance (O&M). ", "Appendix 9  47 \n   \n13.  With the Project, energy costs will be raised to the long run marginal cost of production, \nassessed  at  $0.02/kilowatt-hour,2  from  the  current  level  of  $0.005/kilowatt-hour.  These \nadjustments in electricity tariffs will, in turn, increase the cost of providing water to farms. As a \nresult, for irrigation schemes that primarily use water pumped to heights of over 100 meters, the \nnominal costs of water use are expected to increase substantially. That is especially the case of \nproject areas in Sughd region, where the use of pump irrigation is prevalent. \n14.  Similarly, water charges will be increased gradually to reflect the full cost recovery of \nO&M costs and water users\u2019 associations will begin to levy their own O&M charges to sustain \non-farm systems. Producers are likely to respond to a more reliable water supply by using more \ninputs to attain significant improvements in productivity.  \n15.  The economic analyses were conducted for a period of 20 years in 2002 constant prices \nand in United States (US) dollars. Year 1 is year 2003, the year in which the Project is expected \nto commence. \n16.  The official exchange rate of TJS2.68/$1.00 prevailing at the time of appraisal (March \n2002) was used in the analyses. Direct and indirect local currency contents of input and output \nprices were converted to US dollars using the official exchange rate.  \n17.   Cotton, wheat, and fertilizer prices were projected using the World Bank\u2019s commodity \nprice projections. Adjustments for transport, handling, storage, insurance, intermediary margins, \nand physical losses were made for determining farmgate prices. The financial and economic \nfarmgate prices of urea, potassium chloride, and phosphate were derived on an import parity \nbasis.  \n18.  As Tajikistan is a net wheat importer, the farmgate prices of wheat were derived on an \nimport parity basis. The projected international prices of wheat (free on board [FOB], US) for US \nno.1 hard red winter wheat were used for estimating the equivalent border wheat prices after \nadjustments for quality, freight and insurance costs, and charges for handling and transport. In \nderiving farmgate prices of wheat, further adjustments to the border prices were made to \naccount for costs associated with elevator storage, physical losses, drying, and local transport. \n19.  As Tajikistan is a cotton exporter, the farmgate price of seed cotton (raw cotton) was \nderived on an export-parity basis. The economic price of cotton is based on the \u2018Index A\u2019 \ncomposite  price  for  cotton  traded  in  northern  Europe.  It  was  derived  from  the  projected \ninternational prices of cotton fiber (cost, insurance, and freight; Europe), by adjusting for (i) \nquality  discount  for  Tajikistan  average  grades;3  (ii)  railway  transport  and  insurance;  (iii) \nintermediary costs including ginning costs; and (iv) the value of by-products such as seeds, fluff, \nand lint. On the average, the quantity of fiber produced amounts to about 32% of seed cotton by \nweight. The value of by-products represents about 14% of the value of the fiber equivalent. \n20.   The economic analysis was based on the world price numeraire, and adjustments to \nfinancial prices were made to reflect the removal of sales taxes for cotton, and the application of \na Standard Conversion Factor of 0.9 to the domestic resources. The basic wage rates on the \nfarms in 2002 were estimated at $1.4/day. Given a situation of less than full employment in the \nrural areas, a Shadow Wage Rate Factor of 0.8 was used in the analysis.  \nA\n                                                  p\np\n2  Estimates by World Bank staff for their recent Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project.  en\n3  Uzbekistan supplies the bulk of cotton originating from Central Asia. Uzbek cotton consistently trades slightly below  dix\nthe Index A price-approximately 5% lower. For the analysis, the value of Uzbek seed cotton traded in northern   9\n \nEurope serves to establish an upper limit to the economic value of cotton seed in Tajikistan at the farm gate. \n4\n7\n   ", "48  Appendix 9 \n \nD.  Benefits \n21.  The benefits from irrigation and drainage rehabilitation were derived from prevention of \nfurther decline of crop yields and expected increases in crop yields. With-project, the expected \nannual production levels of the cultivated crops are estimated to rise steadily till year 9: for \ncotton from 66,909 t to 131,812 t, and for wheat, from 42,917 t to 69,758 t and stabilize \nafterwards. Without-project, the annual crop production levels would continually decline and in \nyear 9 would reach the production levels of 34,420 t for cotton and 23,404 t for wheat. \nE.  Economic Internal Rates of Return \n22.  With economic prices calculated on the basis of the world price numeraire, the overall \nEIRR of the Project was estimated at 22.9%, with an economic net present worth of $29.1 \nmillion at the discount rate of 12%. \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n23.  The sensitivity of EIRR to declines in prices, yields, and project benefits; and decrease in \nproject benefits and increase in investment costs are presented in Table A9.1. \n24.  If cotton and wheat prices fall by 10% throughout the entire project period, the ERR \nwould decline to 18.2% and if cotton and wheat yields fall by 10% during that period, the EIRR \nwould decline to 17.6%. Similarly, if the project benefits decrease by 10%, the EIRR would fall \nto 19% and the delays in project benefit by 1 year would move the EIRR to 17.0%. If the project \ninvestment cost is increased by 10%, the EIRR would decrease to 21.7%. The switching value \nresults suggest that, for the net present value to fall to zero, the cotton and wheat price need to \ndecline by 20%, their yield by 18%, or project benefits by 24%. And other factors remaining \nunchanged, an increase by 37% in project investment cost will bring the net present value to \nzero. Overall, the project EIRRs are not overly sensitive to possible adverse effects such as the \ndeclines in prices, yields, benefits streams/delays in benefit streams or increases in investment \ncosts. In all cases EIRRs, are well above the Asian Development Bank\u2019s acceptable rate of \n12%. \nTable A9.1: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \nNet \nSwitching \nChange  Present  EIRR  Sensitivity \n  Item  Value \n(%)  Value  (%)  Indicator \n(%) \n($ million) \nBase Case    29.1  22.9     \nDeclines in Cotton and Wheat Prices  -10  14.8  18.2  4.91  20 \nDeclines in Cotton and Wheat Yields  -10  13.8  17.6  5.52  18 \nDeclines in Project Benefits  -10  17.2  19.0  4.09  24 \nDelays in Project Benefits  One year  16.4  17.0     \nIncreases in Investment Costs  +10  27.0  21.7  0.73  +37 \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 9  49 \n   \nG.  Financial Analysis: Farm Budgets \n25.  Based on the analytical models developed to assess the performance of the Project in \nthe three irrigation schemes, farm budgets were estimated for each of the three subproject \nareas. These allow determination of the extent of incentives for farmers to participate in the \nProject and of the Project\u2019s expected impact on farmers. \n26.  For future farm budget projections, it is assumed that current distortions in the incentive \nstructure to agriculture will be removed in line with Government policy and that all farm types will \noperate in the same incentive framework. Farm budgets of dehkan farms are expected to differ \nfrom those of large farms in several ways. In cropping pattern, dehkan farms are assumed to \nhave  greater  share  of  wheat  than  large  farms,  since  many  dehkan  farms  operate  on  a \nsubsistence basis and prefer food crops. In addition, yields per hectare of cotton and wheat on a \nportion of dehkan farms (about 10% of land) are 25% higher than average yields due to \nintensive on-farm trials on improvements of soil and water management and introduction of new \nseeds. Also, fixed and overhead costs at dehkan farms are expected to be 15% lower than \nthose at large farms, since the former do not entail huge management and other costs that \ntypical large farms involve. \n27.  For comparative purposes, farm budgets were prepared for both large (non-dehkan) and \nsmall (dehkan) farms, which are expected to exist in the future, either with or without the Project \n(Tables A9.2-A9.3). Large (non-dehkan) farms are essentially restructured state-farms, typically \noperating on around 1,400 ha, whereas small farms are principally individual dehkan farms, \noperating on around 17 ha of land. Although both farm types are expected to have similar \nvariable cost structures for a given crop, they have very different fixed costs and overheads. \nThese are taken into account during budget construction. The analysis assumed that water \ncharges would be increased gradually to reflect full recovery of O&M costs. The net farm \nincome for large and small farms should reflect the returns to the farm management. It  is \nassumed that returns to farm management represent the main incentives to participate in the \nproject. \n28.  Given proper incentives, the Project\u2019s impact on non-dehkan farms is expected to be \nsignificant. The large farms in Khojabakirgan scheme are still expected to make significant \nlosses in the first year, and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu in the first 2 years of the Project. However, the \nlarge farms in the Vakhsh scheme are expected to make a net profit of $29/ha on average. The \nfarm net income will gradually increase in all three schemes until year 9, when it will stabilize for \nthe rest of the project period. In year 9, an average large farm in Khojabakirgan scheme will \nmake a net income of $260/ha; in Vakhsh scheme, $239/ha; and in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, $186/ha. \n29.  The profitability of small dehkan farms is expected to be higher than that of larger farms. \nThe net incomes of small farms will consistently increase until year 9. In year 9, an average \ndehkan farm is expected to make a net income of $300/ha in Khojabakirgan, $224/ha in \nVakhsh, and $190/ha in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu farms. As expected, the profitability of small farms is \nhigher in Khojabakirgan and Kyzylsu-Yakhsu. However, in Vakhsh, the profit /hectare of small \nfarms is lower because of preference to growing wheat for food security purposes. \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 9\n \n4\n9\n   ", "50  Appendix 9 \n \nTable A9.2: Typical Farm Budget \nLarge (non-dehkan) Farm, 1,400 ha \n($) \nYears 9-\nItem  Year 1   Year 2   Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7  Year 8 \n20 \nKhojabakirgan \nTotal Revenues  324,425 328,793 332,350 358,764 624,564 631,812 639,952 728,063 871,112\nTotal Costs  328,547 328,748 329,054 350,634 401,817 402,803 404,496 455,295 507,210\nNet Income  -4,122 46 3,296 8,130 222,747 229,009 235,456 272,767 363,903\nNet Income/ha  -3 0 2 6 159 164 168 195 260\nVakhsh \nTotal Revenues  367,474 372,894 376,915 388,503 638,018 644,674 649,864 702,787 814,128\nTotal Costs  326,781 326,992 327,400 334,152 420,504 421,195 420,968 452,551 480,043\nNet Income  40,692 45,901 49,515 54,351 217,515 223,479 228,896 250,235 334,085\nNet Income/ha  29 33 35 39 155 160 163 179 239\nKyzylsu-Yakhsu \nTotal Revenues  229,483  233,839 235,797 238,744 427,219 430,873 431,978 505,247 616,908\nTotal Costs  234,409  234,585 234,902 235,087 283,645 283,959 283,673 330,570 356,497\nNet Income  -4,925  -746 895 3,657 143,574 146,914 148,304 174,677 260,412\nNet Income/ha  -4  -1 1 3 103 105 106 125 186\n \nTable A9.3: Typical Farm Budget \nDehkan Farm, 17 ha \n($) \n   Year 1   Year 2   Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7  Year 8  Years 9-20\nKhojabakirgan \nTotal Revenues  3,939  3,993 3,800  4,403 7,700 7,805  7,962 10,230  12,267\nTotal Costs  3,894  3,896 3,731  4,284 4,946 4,972  5,038 6,376  7,164\nNet Income  45  96 69  118 2,754 2,832  2,924 3,855  5,103\nNet Income/ha  3  6 4  7 162 167  172 227  300\nVakhsh \nTotal Revenues  4,229  4,528 4,577  4,437 7,288 7,355  7,397 8,010  9,255\nTotal Costs  3,684  3,872 3,872  3,748 4,721 4,728  4,726 5,096  5,443\nNet Income  545  656 705  689 2,567 2,627  2,671 2,914  3,812\nNet Income/ha  32  39 41  41 151 155  157 171  224\nKyzylsu-Yakhsu \nTotal Revenues  2,787  2,839 2,863  2,899 5,188 5,232  5,245 6,135  7,491\nTotal Costs  2,778  2,780 2,784  2,785 3,382 3,385  3,382 3,938  4,253\nNet Income  9  60 79  114 1,806 1,847  1,863 2,197  3,238\nNet Income/ha  1  4 5  7 106 109  110 129  190\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector  Identified  as  a  National  Priority  In  Country  Poverty  Analysis/Poverty  Partnership \nAgreement:  \n  The Government has set poverty reduction as its primary objective for sustainable development. \nIt has finalized its national poverty reduction strategy, which was endorsed by the Parliament on 24 June \n2002.  The  strategy  will  focus  on  (i)  accelerated,  socially  fair,  labor-intensive,  and  export-oriented \neconomic growth; (ii) efficient and fair provision of basic social services; (iii) targeted support to the \npoorest groups of the population; and (iv) efficient governance and improvement in security. Agriculture \nsector development that emphasizes improving productivity and creating jobs has a key role in the \nstrategy\u2019s pro-poor growth intervention. The high priority accorded to agriculture sector development is \nwarranted as about four-fifths of the poor population reside in the countryside and most rural residents \ndepend on farming as their main income and food source.  \n  The poverty reduction strategy likewise accords equal attention to addressing nonincome-based \npoverty. Less than one-fourth of total rural households have piped drinking water; many obtain their \nwater from open ditches, thus increasing their susceptibility to waterborne diseases. Only 2% of the rural \ncommunities are connected to sewerage systems. Thus, the poverty reduction strategy, having adopted \nthe Millennium Development Goals, has set as a target that, by 2010, 80% of the total households will \nhave access to safe water. \n  The  Government  and  ADB  are  finalizing  a  poverty  partnership  agreement.  Improving \nproductivity and facilitating diversification of the economic structure particularly in the agriculture sector \nhave been identified as major areas for poverty reduction in the short and medium terms. Another focal \narea is the provision of potable water especially in the rural areas. For both areas of intervention, targets \nwill be set and monitored periodically to ensure their significant impact on poverty. \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Tajikistan: \n  Tajikistan is predominantly an agriculture economy as the sector contributes 20% of gross \ndomestic product, 30% of export revenues, and more than half of total employment. Almost 80% of the \ntotal arable land is irrigated.  \n  There  are  at  least  two  ways  that  agriculture  development  will  make  significant  inroads  in \ncombating poverty in the country. First, improved productivity and more efficient irrigation systems will \ntranslate to higher outputs and increased incomes of the rural poor. At present, about three-fifths of the \npopulation live in rural areas and rely primarily on production of their irrigated garden plots (averaging \n0.1-0.2 hectare [ha]/household) as their main source of food and some cash income. These subsistence \nplots,  together  with  the  small-sized  private-owned  (dehkan)  farms  contribute  about  40%  of  total \nagriculture production. \n  However, total production and productivity in all farms have been low. Total output of  the \nagriculture sector on average is just 55% of the 1991 output level and the yield in 2000 was 44% of the \n1991 yield level. For the poor who subsist mainly on their small garden plots, lack of irrigation and \naccess to new farm practices have limited their cropping intensity to the spring months, thus preventing \nthem from additional cash income during the winter season. Moreover, because of the poor performance \nof the agriculture sector, wage laborers in the sector, who are also poor, suffer. Their wages have \ndeteriorated in real terms; and payments of their salaries have frequently been delayed. In 2001, arrears \nin the agriculture sector were highest across sectors at TJS11.0 million. \n  The second contribution of the sector to reducing poverty is by creating jobs. At least 30% of \nrural households are unemployed. Moreover, because of the civil strife, 18% of the total households are \nfemale-headed. With the limited creation of formal sector employment, overseas work and jobs in the \ninformal sector are the next best alternative. Improved productivity in agriculture that expands labor use \nand diversify crop use will be more economically and socially sustainable. More jobs and increasing \nA\nincomes  in  the  agriculture  sector  spur  rural  industries  that  in  turn,  form  the  base  for  rural  p\np\nindustrialization; in-country (as opposed to overseas) employment reduces the potentials for family and  e\nn\ncultural breakdowns.  d\nix\n 1\n0\n \n5\n1\n   ", "52  Appendix 10 \n  Increased  and  improved  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  better  sanitation  practices  will \ncontribute significantly to addressing non-income poverty. Infectious and parasitic diseases (especially \nthose that are waterborne) are the second leading causes of deaths in the country and disproportionally \naffect the poor. Provision of safe drinking water and education on good sanitation practices focus on \nimproving the health conditions of the poor and vulnerable groups and lessening the burden for women \nand children in fetching water. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis:  Proposed Classification - Core Poverty Intervention \n \n  In the project areas in Khatlon and Sughd, the poverty incidence is higher than the national \naverage of 83%. About 89% of the rural populace in Khatlon region and 87% in Sughd region are \nconsidered poor, with average monthly spending of below TJS20/family/month. In the project area, the \nincidence of poverty is estimated at 88%. Among these poor, about 45% are considered very poor with \nexpenditures of TJS10-20/family/month. The Project is expected to increase the incomes of this group \nso that their spending will be more than TJS20/month and thus they will be pulled out of poverty. The \nremaining 43% are extremely poor. with expenditures less than TJS10/family/month. Income sources of \nthe rural populace are partly from farm wages (16% of their total income) but most rely on farming both \nfor subsistence and for sale (63%); a few households received remittances from their close kin working \noutside the region or augment their household income through occasional public works activities and \ncotton harvesting. Women and children from poor households are employed on a voluntary basis during \nthe cotton harvesting season. The poor especially in Khatlon depend mainly on their household crops for \ntheir food, with hardly any marketable surplus left. Most of the rural populace in these regions employ \ncoping strategies for survival such as shifting to cheaper food stuffs, decreasing the number of daily \nmeals, and decreasing the amount of food consumed. These have led to declines in per capita daily \ncaloric intake and inadequate family nutrition. Other coping strategies include the selling of assets, \nborrowing, and migrating to other regions and outside the country for work. Partly because of the war \nand due to out-migration in search of jobs, as many as 25,000 families, most of whom are found in the \nKhatlon region, have female heads who have to cope with rearing their children and of finding income \nand food for the family. \n  Lack of income- and job-creating activities in the countryside, and the declining productivity of \nthe arable lands are the principal causes of the income-based poverty. Official unemployment in the \nproject areas is 11-18% although unofficial estimates peg the unemployment rates at 30%. Moreover, \nthe deterioration of irrigation facilities combined with poor farming practices (e.g., limited use of high \nquality seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, and farm machinery) has resulted in decreasing yields of major \ncrops (cotton and wheat), and in lower cropping intensities. Cotton yields in the project areas are 0.7-1.8 \nt/ha while wheat yields are 0.8-2.0 t/ha; both are less than half the 1990 levels. As a consequence, many \nof the farm workers in the large farm enterprises have declining wages and delayed payments. For the \npoor who subsist mainly on their small garden plots, lack of irrigation and access to new farm practices \nhave  limited  their  cropping  intensity  to  the  spring  months,  thus  preventing  them  from  generating \nadditional cash income during the winter season. Low incomes induced a shift to consumption of \ncheaper foodstuffs and lower intake of protein, vitamins, and micronutrients, resulting into stunting and \nwasting problems among children and anemia among pregnant and lactating mothers.  \n  Poverty in the project areas is also nonincome based. Limited access to potable water topped \nthe list of concerns among the households in the project areas. The poor in the project areas have the \nleast access to potable water; and are more susceptible to waterborne diseases. In Khojabakirgan, only \nabout 25% of people have access to water supply and more than 50% obtain their water from open \nditches, 33% from water pipes, and less than 5% buy water from tanker trucks. In the Khatlon region, the \nsituation is more severe as less than 20% have access to water supply and more than 75% of the \npopulation obtain their water from open ditches such as irrigation canals. Some people walk as far as 10 \nkilometers to collect water for domestic use; in Kyzylsu-Yakhsu, queuing for water takes as much as 6 \nhours. In all these areas, many of the water fetchers are children and women. Because of the poor \nquality of potable water, and lack of knowledge of good sanitation practices, a large proportion of the \nproject\u2019s population suffers from waterborne diseases. All of the targeted districts have incidence rates \nof typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, and malaria ranging from 130% to 230% of the national average. \n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \n  A stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance and \nthe target clientele and the issues to be addressed was verified with a small sample of stakeholders \nduring the preappraisal mission. In both stages, an iterative process using (i) quantitative (sample \nsurveys  at  village  levels)  and  qualitative  (focused  group  discussions, stakeholder workshop, and \nconsultation meetings and dialogues) approaches, and (ii) secondary and primary information was \nemployed to ensure that the issues and needs of the poor and vulnerable groups are properly identified; \nthat the poor will benefit disproportionately from the investment Project in a sustainable manner; that \ngender, environment, and other social issues are tackled; and that the prospective beneficiaries will be \nactively involved in implementing and monitoring the Project. Also, three of the five criteria for the \nselection of the investment project schemes were pro-poor focused (i) broad geographical coverage but \nwith emphasis on the poorer districts, (ii) absence of safe drinking water source, and (iii) the willingness \nof local communities to participate.  \n  The  project  areas  cover  26  villages  with  a  total  rural  population  of  471,500,  the  primary \nbeneficiaries  of  the  proposed  Project.  Of  total  beneficiaries,  45%  are  poor  (those  with  spending \nTJS10-TJS20/month), 40% are very poor (spending of TJS4-TJS10/month), and 3% are extremely poor \nwith spending less than TJS4/month. The main vulnerable groups are (i) households with more than five \nchildren, (ii) single-headed families especially those headed by women, (iii) families with inadequate \nnon-agriculture employment, (iv) the elderly, and (v) members of dehkan collective farms producing \ncotton. Most households have small garden plots that provide their main source of income and food; a \nfew own livestock for additional food and income. Food is their largest expenditure. When asked during \nthe group discussion what their priority needs are, the following were mentioned often: (i) lack of drinking \nwater facilities, (ii) poor condition of irrigation facilities; (iii) lack of jobs; (iv) high rates of infectious \ndiseases; and (v) lack of access to agriculture inputs (fertilizers and seeds), farm equipment, and \nupdated farming practices. Women play multiple roles at the household level, and as a consequence, \ncannot fully participate in or have equal access to information and technology, and land tenure rights. \nWith project implementation, intensive farming will ensue in the garden, dehkan, and other farm types, \nresulting in increased work hours for women. In general, women farmers consider this a plus factor \nbecause of the low incomes and job opportunities in the project areas.  \n \nParticipation Strategy \n \n  To help ensure that the poverty reduction outcomes envisaged by the Project are realized, a \nparticipatory plan will be developed and incorporated in the  monitoring and evaluation of the social \nimpact and in the creation of the community-based groups. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the \nbeneficiaries of the project components, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups, are involved in the \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring components and in the establishment and operations of the \ncommunity-based groups. Special attention will be accorded to the involvement of female-headed farm \nhouseholds and agriculture women in the project areas who will benefit from construction of irrigation \nand drainage facilities and the rehabilitation of potable water supply systems and the health education \ntrainings. Various participatory approaches will be employed in facilitating the involvement of other \nconcerned  parties  such  as  the  central  and  local  agencies  and  governments,  nongovernmental \norganizations, private sector, and other members of civil society. \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n0\n \n5\n3\n   ", "54  Appendix 10 \nD.

Gender Analysis and Plan \n1.  Gender Status and Issues.  The women in Tajikistan bore the brunt of the combined adverse \nimpact of the country\u2019s transition to a market economy and the 5-year civil conflict, which ensued \nimmediately after independence. The economic and social difficulties during the transition years have \nconstrained economic activity and, in turn, intensified women\u2019s workload and  participation in both the \ninformal  sector  and  low-paying  formal  labor  market.  Women\u2019s  limited  access  to  productive  and \nremunerative resources has constrained their economic opportunities, and especially for rural women, \nhas confined them to just the coping strategies for survival. Partly because of the war and due to out-\nmigration in search of jobs, as many as 25,000 families, the majority of them in the Khatlon region, have \nfemale heads who have to cope with rearing their children and finding income and food for the family. \nThus, to make ends meet, rural women play multiple roles. They farm intensively their garden plots, which \nprovide the main food and income source for their families. If they have some savings, the women buy \nsome livestock and take care of these animals. They are also responsible for marketing any surplus in \ntheir produce as well as planning and executing the household budget. Rural women are the bulk of the \nworkforce during cotton and wheat harvesting. They are also responsible for taking care of the elderly and \ndisabled.  \n \n2.  The women were adversely affected by the collapse of the social safety nets and social protection \nmeasures. Much of these roles were left to the women to assume in their homes, which effectively \nreduced their participation in social and political groups at the community and national levels. With the \nclosures of nurseries, mothers took over the care of their young children. Net enrolment of girls to boys \nalso declined dramatically, especially at the 7-18 year age brackets. Taking care of the elderly and the \ndisabled became roles of the women. Deteriorating health status among women and children worsened \nwith the decline in health care services and reduction of municipal infrastructure, particularly potable \ndrinking water. Aside from being vulnerable to waterborne diseases, women and children have the added \nburden of fetching drinking water from open ditches, canals, and river streams; often times, they walk a \nfar distance to obtain water. \n  \n3.
