The additional financing \nwill  (i)  train  and  certify  an  additional  19,400  government  internal  auditors  and  public  finance \nofficers at the central and local levels; 2 (ii) support the sustainability of a competency- and needs-\nbased e-learning training approach (within the framework of a national training institute) by further \nupgrading  training  systems  and  providing  modern  facilities  adapted  to  e-learning  (including \ntraining centers in four regional locations); and (iii) develop fully integrated systems for financial \nmanagement reporting and supervision in line with the national e-government strategy, adoption \nof continuous audit and continuous monitoring (CA/CM), implementation of a risk management \napproach for internal audit, and provision of training to 12,500 system users.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  has  consistently  averaged  around \n5.0% during the past five years, and the country has achieved steady poverty reduction over the \nsame period with its national poverty rate declining from 11.3% in 2014 to 9.7% in 2018. Yet, as \nnoted in the sector assessment,3 to maintain the momentum of its development efforts and at the \nsame  time  realize  the  development  outcomes  under  the  National  Medium-Term  Development \nPlan  (RPJMN),  2015\u201320194 and the  Sustainable Development  Goals,  enhancing  the  quality  of \nthe public spending is critical. Indonesia\u2019s 2017 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \n(PEFA) Assessment Report outlines areas where Indonesia\u2019s public financial management (PFM) \nsystem needs to improve if poverty and inequality, particularly in access to public services, are to \nbe further reduced. The lack of accountability at different levels of the government, including at \ndecentralized  tiers  in  provinces  and  districts,  causes  inefficiency,  budget  inconsistencies,  and \npossible mis-utilization of public funds. The proposed additional financing, building on the good \nprogress  made  under  the  ongoing  project,  will  further  support  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s \nreform priorities in the PFM sector. \n \n\n \n\nOngoing project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on \n31  October  2012,  financed  by  a  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  in  the  amount  of \n$57.75 million. The loan became effective on 19 February 2013. The ongoing project has three \nmain  outputs:  (i)  capacity  development  for  government  internal  auditors  and  public  finance \n\n \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \n\nProposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the State Accountability Revitalization Project. Manila. \n\n2  In seeking to improve the quality of internal audit, the ongoing project has focused its capacity building efforts on two \ngroups: government internal auditors and public finance officers. The need to improve the skills and competency of \ninternal auditors is self-evident, but one particular strength of the ongoing project is that it seeks to simultaneously \nimprove the ability of public finance officers to prepare financial statements of public expenditures that meet audit \nstandards. This twin-track approach will continue under the proposed additional financing. Another important element \nof the ongoing project approach, especially given Indonesia\u2019s decentralized form of government, is strengthening \ncapacity at the local government level, which will also be continued and expanded under the additional financing. \n\n3  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Government of Indonesia, National Development Planning Agency.

As of 31 May 2019 (89% \nof  the  elapsed  time),  the  ongoing  project\u2019s  physical  progress  was  98%  with \ncumulative contract awards and disbursements at 98.9% of the loan amount. \n\nThere  is  full  compliance  with  the  safeguard  covenants.  The  ongoing  project  is \ncategory  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples, with no safeguard impacts. \n\nDelivery  of  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful.  Most  output  targets  of  the \nongoing project have been exceeded. Under output 1, 3,442 government internal \nauditors and public finance officers graduated with degrees against the target of \n2,500 (44% were women against the target of 30%).6 A total of 22,213 participants \nreceived nondegree training, far exceeding the target of 9,800 (female participation \nin nondegree training was 40%, also exceeding the 30% target). Under output 2, \ne-learning  system  has  been  in  operation  with  a  total  of  39  e-learning  and  88 \nblended  training  modules  developed  and  used,  covering  both  functional  auditor \ncertification  training  and  technical  training.  Eight  centers  of  excellence  were \ncreated  in  universities  against  the  target  of  14.7 The  remaining  six  centers  are \nexpected  to  be  achieved  under  the  additional  financing.  Under  output  3,  the \ndevelopment  of  a  management  information  system  on  accountability  has \nintegrated  supervision  planning,  implementation,  and  reporting  systems  of  the \nexecuting agency, the Central Government Internal Auditor (BPKP). \n\n \n(iv)  Management  of  risks  is  rated  successful.  The  ongoing  project  has  successfully \nmanaged the risks identified during project preparation, and there have been no \nsubstantial issues during implementation. \n\n \n\nNeed  for  upskilling  internal  auditors  and  public  finance  officers  who  are  yet  to \nbenefit from training. The ongoing project has demonstrated considerable success in upskilling \npublic  internal  auditors  and  finance  officers  for  better  PFM  thereby  contributing  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall accountability revitalization agenda. This is reflected in the increased quality \nof audit opinions from the Supreme Audit Board. During the period covered by RPJMN, 2015\u2013\n2019 the share of unqualified audit opinions reached 91% for the central government and 74% \nfor local governments. This is a substantial improvement from 10 years earlier, when fewer than \nhalf  of  audit  opinions  were  recognized  as  being  fairly  and  appropriately  presented.  For  the \nforthcoming RPJMN, 2020\u20132024, the government plans to increase the share of unqualified audit \nopinions  to  97%  for  the  central  government  and  provincial  governments,  and  90%  for  district \ngovernments. To meet these targets, BPKP estimates that additional 46,560 certified government \ninternal  auditors  are  needed.  As  of  May  2019,  however,  there  were  only  13,749  certified \ngovernment  internal  auditors,  of  which  about  8,450  were  certified  under  the  ongoing  project. \nRecognizing  the  project\u2019s  success  to  date,  the  government  wishes  to  extend  the  training  to  a \n\n \n\n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Government of Indonesia, Central Government Internal Auditor (BPKP). 2018. Draft Project Completion Report: State \n\nAccountability Revitalization Project. Jakarta. \n\n7   The ongoing project did not fully achieve the target because there were only eight leading universities that met the \nreadiness criteria set by BPKP. The additional financing will support additional six universities to meet the readiness \ncriteria.    \n\n\fmuch larger group of internal auditors and finance officers to ensure its RPJMN targets are met. \nThe government also wishes to make the new approach to training provision more decentralized \nand sustainable. The proposed additional financing will support the government\u2019s efforts to fill this \ngap in training and certification for government internal auditors and public finance officers. The \ntraining  funded  by  the  project  is  part  of  a  major  push  by  the  government  to  comprehensively \nupgrade the standard of internal audit and the quality of financial reports on public expenditure. \nSince this is a non-routine skills upgrading over a limited period, the government will continue to \nborrow significantly more than the ongoing project for this major capacity enhancement exercise. \nRegular in-service training is budgeted annually. \n \n\n \n\nNeed for integrated systems. An upgrading of the FMISs is also needed to enhance the \nprocessing efficiency and accuracy of financial statements, and the timeliness of the submission \nof financial statements to the Supreme Audit Board. Based on government regulation on regional \nfinancial  management,  the  government  will  require  local  governments\u2019  FMISs  to  be  integrated \nwith  other  systems  to  support  harmonization  of  data  systems  in  the  context  of  fiscal \ndecentralization. This activity is not part of the ongoing project, but will be addressed under the \nadditional  financing.  Currently,  more  than  30  different  FMISs  are  being  used  by  542  local \ngovernments to manage budget planning, execution, accounting, reporting, and other functions. \nThere are three main systems in use, but they, as well as other lesser-used FMISs, operate as \nstand-alone  systems.  Thus,  district-level,  province-level,  and  national-level  consolidation  and \nmonitoring of both financial and nonfinancial data rely on manual transfer with all the attendant \nrisks and time delays. Additionally, reporting entities do not use a standard chart of accounts, and \nproblems arise with varying data structures and definitions, as each local government defines its \nown  coding  structure.  Effective  uptake  of  an  integrated  system  will  require  upskilling  of \ngovernment officials.  \n \n\n \n\nGovernment  policy.  The  forthcoming  RPJMN,  2020\u20132024  is  expected  to  promote \nbureaucratic institutional reform through several mechanisms, including improving performance \naccountability  and  supervision  capacities.  Focus  will  be  given  to  utilization  of  information  and \ncommunication technology to improve transparency, accuracy, accountability, and public service \ndelivery.  This  will  involve  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  goods  and  services  procurement \nsystem,  as  well  as  upgrading  and  supporting  the  rollout  of  the  Government  Internal  Control \nSystem (GICS). The proposed additional financing will support the implementation of the GICS to \nachieve the maturity index of level 3 by 100% for all central line ministries and local governments \nby 2024 as set in the RPJMN, 2020-2024.8  \n \n\n \n\nThe  2017  PEFA  Assessment  Report  found  that,  while  the  internal  control  function  is \nadequately defined in the legal and regulatory framework, the country\u2019s FMIS is not sufficiently \nintegrated with other PFM systems.9 In addition, internal audit plans and reports are implemented, \nbut findings are not followed up on in a consistent and effective manner. The PEFA assessment \nreport  highlighted  areas  for  improvement,  including  conforming  with  standards  outlined  in  the \nInstitute  of  Internal  Auditors\u2019  international  professional  practices  framework.10 The  report  also \nstressed  a  need  to  (i)  address  strategic  issues  relating  to  governance,  risk  management,  and \ncontrol  processes  in  cross-sector  and  government-wide  programs;  and  (ii)  build  certification \n\nimplementation.  \n\n \n\n8   BPKP  is  using  a  maturity  model  with  five  levels  of  index  (from  1  to  5)  to  measure  the  maturity  of  the  GICS \n\n9  The 2017 PEFA assessment report for Indonesia covered 3 years (2014\u20132016) with a cutoff date of August 2017. A \nprior PEFA assessment was carried out in 2011, but a direct comparison of indicators and scores is not possible as \nthe framework and methodology changed twice in the intervening period. However, the 2017 report concluded that \nthe  \u201cneedle  has  moved  in  the  right  direction.\u201d  World  Bank.  2018.

The proposed additional financing responds to these recommendations, \nand thereby supports institutional strengthening and contributes to improved sustainability of PFM \nin Indonesia.11 \n \n\n \n\nAdditional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) is a high priority of the government;12 and (iii) is consistent with \nthe  ongoing  project\u2019s  development  objectives,  the  government\u2019s  priorities,  and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019,  under  which  ADB  supports  the  government\u2019s \nefforts  to  foster  good  governance  by  improving  financial  accountability,  with  a  focus  on  local \ngovernments.13 The overall project will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 16 (peace, \njustice,  and  strong  institutions);  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  6 \n(strengthening governance and institutional capacity);14 and supports the implementation of the \nSecond Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (improving governance, and institutional and \ncorruption  risks).15 The  ongoing  project  is  performing  well,  has  been  rated  on  track  since  its \ncommencement,  and  implementation  progress  and  results  are  satisfactory.  Safeguards \nrequirements have been complied with and risks have been adequately managed (para. 5). \n \n\n \n\nADB value addition. Development of e-learning under the ongoing project has proven to \nbe  about  30%  more  efficient  than  traditional  classroom  training. 16  The  efficiency  gains  are \nexpected  to  be  even  greater  with  the  new  facilities  and  equipment  to  be  provided  under  the \nadditional financing. These gains will allow BPKP to deliver more training for the same or less \nbudget.  Training  will  also  be  better  targeted  to  the  individual  needs  of  trainees  and  their  host \norganizations: a learning value chain with a needs- and competency-based approach will move \nthe provision of training away from a one-size-fits-all model to a more customized one. This will \nensure  a  greater  return  from  the  expenditure  on  training.  The  innovative  approach  to  training \ndelivery,  especially  for  a  decentralized  form  of  government  such  as  Indonesia\u2019s  provides  a \nsignificant demonstration effect. Further, the ongoing project has promoted trilateral cooperation \nbetween  BPKP,  local  governments,  and  universities  through  the  degree  program  and  the \nestablishment  of  centers  of  excellence  at  leading  universities  in  providing  PFM  courses  and \nresearch.

In addition, the waiting time to enroll in a class has \nalso been significantly reduced, as the training center is able to conduct more courses. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: accountability of public institutions able to \ndeliver high-quality public services strengthened.17 The project will have the following outcome: \ncapacity of government internal auditors and public finance officers in budget planning, reporting, \ninternal audit, and asset management improved.18 \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nOutput  1:  Capacity  of  government  internal  auditors  and  public  finance  officers \ndeveloped.  Under this output, the  additional  financing  will  allow  BPKP  to  provide training  and \ncertification to 19,400 government internal auditors and public finance officers at the central and \nlocal government levels. Specialized training will be provided for (i) substantive technical training \nin risk management, strategic audit, audit reporting, audit management, procurement audit, PFM \ntransactions in planning, budgeting, accounting, procurement, asset management, and financial \nreporting; and (ii) nonmandatory certification in internal auditing, fraud prevention, and accounting. \nTraining in financial reporting and auditing will also be provided to public finance officers involved \nin development partner-funded projects. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  2:  Competency-  and  needs-based  e-learning  approach  institutionalized. \nUnder this output, the additional financing will help BPKP reorient and reequip its existing training \ninstitute (the government internal auditor corporate university), providing it with new fully equipped \nfacilities at four regional hubs (Bali, Bogor, Makassar, and Medan) for the production and delivery \nof e-learning courses. As part of the reorientation, the training institute will adopt a competency- \nand  needs-based  approach.  Under this  new  approach,  job  models  (using  the  integrated talent \nmanagement  system  developed  under  the  ongoing  project)  will  be  established  for  the  various \nlevels of internal auditors and public finance officers and learning road maps will be produced for \neach position in line with the needs of the trainee\u2019s organization. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  3:  Audit  and  financial  management  information  systems  improved.  Under \nthis output, the additional financing will upgrade the existing BPKP-developed local government \nFMIS, the Regional Financial Management Information System (SIMDA), to meet regulatory and \ntechnology requirements for e-government and to be fully integrated across planning, budgeting, \nreporting, auditing, and monitoring. Also, as part of this output, a CA/CM information system will \nbe  embedded  in  the  BPKP-developed  FMIS.  The  CA/CM  information  system  will  enhance  the \ncapabilities  of  internal  auditors  by  allowing  them  to  determine  their  audit  approaches  on  a \ncontinuous basis; promote compliance with policies, procedures, and regulations; and monitor the \nstatus  of,  and  follow  up  on,  audit  finds  by  the  external  auditor.  BPKP  will  also  develop  risk \nassessment tools under this project to ensure that audits are carried out in the areas of greatest \nrisk.  In  addition  to  the  training  under  output  1,  training  associated  with  the  rollout  of  various \nsystems developed under this output will also be carried out and provided to 12,500 system users. \n \nD. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $104.92 million, of which $90 million is proposed to be \nfinanced  by  a  regular  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (Table  1).

BPKP  has  performed  well  in  this  role.  The  head  of  the \nBureau of Performance Management, Organization, and Governance (previously known as the \nBureau  for  Audit  Planning)  under  BPKP  will  continue  to  head  the  project  management  unit.  A \nproject  implementing  unit  will  be  set  up  in  the  BPKP\u2019s  Training  and  Education  Center  to  be \nresponsible for implementing activities under outputs 1 and 2, while the BPKP\u2019s Directorate for \nRegional Financial Management II will be responsible for implementing activities under output 3. \n \n\n \n\nThe additional financing will be implemented from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2025. Based \non the list of activities identified, the project will require a project management consulting firm to \nsupport  the  executing  agency  during  implementation  (as  is  the  case  for  the  ongoing  project), \nwhich will minimally include a team of specialists for training, financial management, procurement, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Table  3  presents  the  implementation  arrangements,  which  are \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\n1 April 2020\u201331 March 2025 \n31 March 2025 \n30 September 2025 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n \n\nSteering committee \nPrincipal secretary, BPKP (chair) \nRelevant directors from BPKP, MOF, MOHA, and BAPPENAS (members) \nBPKP \nProject management unit (Bureau of Performance Management, \nOrganization, and Governance), BPKP, 10 staff \nBPKP Training and Education Center, 10 staff, \nBPKP Directorate of Regional Financial Management II, 5 staff \nNational competitive \nbidding \nShopping \nQCBS \n\n1 contract \nMultiple contracts \n(4,590 person-months) \nProject management consultant (QCBS, 1,300 person-months, $5,200,000); \nengineering management consultant for building construction (QCBS, 160 \nperson-months, $640,000) \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\n$100,000 \n$15,400,000 \n\nMultiple contracts \n\n$26,000,000 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BAPPENAS = Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (National Development \nPlanning Agency), BPKP = Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan (Central Government Internal Auditor), \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, MOHA = Ministry of Home Affairs, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB. \n  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nThe additional financing will allow BPKP to upgrade SIMDA and other FMISs to enable \ninteroperability and to link to the central government system, including for budget reconciliation \npurposes. It will also provide significant technical improvements through the adoption of standard \nchart of accounts. An assessment of technical viability will be conducted during system design, \ntaking  into  account  the  standardization  of  budget  classification  and/or  chart  of  accounts  and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbusiness processes mandated by the Ministry of Finance. A review of available infrastructure and \ntechnology, and compatibility with other FMISs will be undertaken prior to system installation and \nimplementation. Training will be provided to local government officials for system operation and \nmaintenance. \n \n\n \n\nThe project will address important sector weaknesses identified by the PEFA assessment \n(para. 9), particularly by raising the standards of internal audit to move beyond simple compliance \nchecks to the identification and addressing of systemic risks, and the quality of internal control \nmechanisms supported by information systems. The CA/CM to be developed under output 3 will \nhelp internal audit offices to monitor the status of audit findings follow-up. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe  economic  rationale  for  the  project  rests  largely  on  promoting  good  governance \nthrough stronger capacity of public internal auditors and finance officers. Good governance will \nprovide  efficient  and  effective  use  of  state  funds  for  better  public  service  delivery,  which  will \nimprove  the  well-being  of  the  population  and  be  of  development  benefit  to  the  nation.  Budget \nleakages  across  governments  in  the  country  are  expected  to  be  reduced  through  improved \ncompetency  of  public  internal  auditors  and  finance  officers.  Improved  governance  and \ntransparency will also improve investor confidence, which will improve the country\u2019s credit rating.20 \n \nC. \n \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\nThe  training  provided  under  the  project  is  part  of  a  major  push  by  the  government  to \ncomprehensively upgrade the capacity of its internal auditors and the public finance officers who \nprepare  reports  on  financial  expenditure,  which  are  the  basis  for  internal  audit.  This  major \nupskilling exercise requires resources far in excess of those for regular in-service training. Once \nthis one-time upgrade of skills is complete, the budget for training of the various agencies involved \nis expected to be sufficient to train new recruits and provide regular in-service training to existing \nstaff,  without  recourse  to  external  assistance.  Sustainability  for  the  provision  of  training  in  the \nfuture will also be ensured by moving BPKP to a more efficient model of training delivery, including \nthrough the widespread adoption of e-learning and closely aligning training provision to training \nneeds. Provision of new facilities appropriate for the new learning approach within the framework \nof the national government internal audit training institute, together with improved facilities in the \nregional  hubs  in  Bali,  Bogor,  Makassar,  and  Medan,  will  also  improve  efficiency  in  training \nprovision. In  addition,  and  in  accordance  with Government  Regulation  No.  20/2014,21 BPKP  is \nable  to  apply  fees  and  charges  for  the  training  it  provides. 22  This  will  further  ensure  the \nsustainability of the program. \n \nD. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nProject-specific governance risks were identified through the financial management and \nprocurement  assessments  of  BPKP. 23 Under  the  ongoing  project,  BPKP  has  been  performing \nsatisfactorily in handling financial management and procurement as shown by the on track rating \nof  the  ongoing  project.  BPKP  has  good  financial  management  capacity  and  is  responsible  for \nsetting  the  benchmark  for  good  financial  management  for  other  government  bodies.  All  BPKP \nstaff  at  the  project  management  unit,  project  implementing  units,  as  well  as  the  procurement \n\n \n\n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This regulation outlines the nontax revenues that BPKP is allowed to collect. \n22 The nontax revenue collected by BPKP from 2014 to 2018 is in the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible \n\nfrom the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fcommittee, hold at the minimum a diploma in accounting. BPKP has sufficient capacity, staffing, \nand systems to undertake financial, accounting, and procurement functions; and proven capacity \nto manage project implementation, financial management, and procurement in accordance with \nADB  policies  and  requirements.  The  overall  fiduciary  risks  before  mitigation  measures  are \nmoderate. Any new staff unfamiliar with ADB procedures will be provided training on ADB project \nmanagement, administration, procurement, and disbursement. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BPKP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\nIn  preparation  for  the  additional  financing,  the  analysis  and  activities  in  the  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy of the ongoing project have been updated and extended to \ncover the scope of the additional financing.24 The overall project has been designed to support \nIndonesia\u2019s  poverty  reduction  goals  through  improved  accountability  of  public  institutions  in \nmanaging  state  funds.  An  internal  audit  function  that  is  risk-based  and  meets  international \nstandards  will  provide  more  effective  checks  on  public  expenditure  and,  together  with  greater \ntransparency and follow-up, will improve the delivery of basic public services to the poor. This will \nalso enhance public confidence in the government. \n \n\n \n\nThe project has some gender elements, as it targets women\u2019s participation in the training \nand certification programs supported by the project. The ongoing project targets 30% participation \nby  women  in  training.  Under  the  additional  financing,  the  target  will  be  raised  to  40%  women \nparticipants  in  aggregate.  There  are  fewer  female  internal  auditors  than  males  in  the  country \nbecause of prior unequal access to education and training by women. On average, female internal \nauditors from 2012 to 2019 comprise only 40% of the total number of auditors nationwide. The \noverall project will include sex-disaggregated data in the monitoring and evaluation system to help \nachieve the women representation target. \n \nF. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nIn compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009),  the  ongoing  project  was \nclassified category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples as it only involved capacity building and software development activities. The additional \nfinancing  will  provide  minor  construction  of  the  BPKP\u2019s  regional  training  hubs  in  Bali,  Bogor, \nMakassar, and Medan on existing government land. Land acquisition and resettlement are not \nexpected.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples.  There  will  be  some  minor \nenvironmental  impacts  during  construction.  These  will  be  addressed  through  a  code  of \nconstruction practice, to be complied with by the works contractor. Overall, under the additional \nfinancing, the project is expected to maintain its category C rating for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nG. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe timing of standardization of charts of \naccounts may not be in line with the upgrading \nof the BPKP-developed FMIS, which may \ndelay the upgrading \nDelays in decision-making by the government \non the harmonization of local government \nFMISs and/or a decision to opt for a single \nsystem other than BPKP\u2019s SIMDA \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nConsultation, and communication, and participation of BPKP in \nthe central government\u2019s task force on standardization of chart of \naccounts. \n\nClose monitoring, consultation, communication, and participation \nof BPKP in the central government\u2019s task force on harmonization \nof systems. Currently, BPKP\u2019s SIMDA is used by about 80% of \nthe local governments, and therefore, if a single system is \nmandated, SIMDA would be the most logical choice, particularly \ngiven the enhancements to SIMDA proposed under the additional \nfinancing. \n\nBPKP  =  Badan  Pemeriksa  Keuangan  dan  Pembangunan  (Central  Government  Internal  Auditor),  FMIS  =  financial \nmanagement  information  system,  SIMDA  =  Sistem  Informasi  Manajemen  Keuangan  Daerah  (Regional  Financial \nManagement Information System). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $90,000,000 \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the additional financing of the State Accountability Revitalization \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 17.5 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n7 November 2019 \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nOngoing project \nAccountability of public institutions able to deliver high-quality public services strengthened (National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019; forthcoming National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020-2024)a  \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nOngoing project \nCapacity of \ngovernment internal \nauditors and public \nfinance officers in \nbudget planning, \nreporting, internal \naudit, and asset \nmanagement \nimproved \n\nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n \n \nInsufficient \nattention to audit \nfindings by the \nexecutive and \nlegislative \nbranches of \ngovernment \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\n \nOngoing project \nBy 2017 \na.
