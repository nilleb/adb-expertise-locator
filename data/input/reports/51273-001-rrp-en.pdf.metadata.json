The report also describes the proposed administration of an equity \ninvestment of up to $45,000,000 (or its equivalent in baht) to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate  Sector  Infrastructure  Fund  (LEAP), 1 and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  equity \ninvestment, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration \nof the equity investment. \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n2. \nProject  identification. Since  the  discovery  of  large  reserves in  the  late  1970s,  natural \ngas from the Gulf of Thailand has provided the Thai economy  with an abundant, low-cost, and \nsecure source  of energy.  Approximately  65%  of Thailand\u2019s  electricity  is  produced from  natural \ngas  and  over  50%  of  demand for  electricity  in the country  is  attributed to  the  industrial  sector. \nNatural gas has been an integral factor in fueling Thailand\u2019s successful industrial transformation \ninto a major export-orientated manufacturing hub within Southeast Asia. Thailand has become a \nworld-class  supplier  of  machinery,  consumer  electronics,  high-tech  components,  and \nautomotives\u2014all  of  which  are  well  integrated  into  regional  and  global  production  networks. \nThailand promotes investment and growth in its industrial sector by establishing industrial parks \nat strategic locations in the country with fully equipped infrastructure facilities and services such \nas roads, water supply, waste treatment, telecommunications, and electricity supply. Reliable and \ncompetitively priced electricity is supplied to industrial customers through Thailand\u2019s distributed \ngeneration model, whereby power plants are located on or near the industrial estates. Building \npower  plants  close  to  the  load  where  electricity  is  consumed  obviates  the  need  for  building \nredundant transmission lines and reduces the amount of electricity that is lost when it is delivered \nover a long distance. \n \n3. \nThe fuel of choice under the distributed generation model has been natural gas, given its \nhigh efficiency and added flexibility in power plant sizing and delivery. Natural gas can serve as \nbaseload,  intermediate,  and  peaking  electrical  power  supply,  meeting  industrial  demand  when \nand as needed. The electricity generated from natural gas also produces excess heat to produce \nsteam, which can be utilized by industrial customers for their manufacturing processes. Without \nthis residual heat source, manufacturers would require additional boiler capacity on site that would \nconsume more fuel, needlessly adding emissions in the process. Waste heat can also be used in \nabsorptive  chillers  to  provide  year-round  cooling  services  to  industrial  customers,  known  as \ntrigeneration  or  combined  heat,  power,  and  cooling.  Natural  gas  generation  also  emits \nsubstantially  less  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  dust,  and  ash  compared  with  coal-fired  power \nplants, the main alternative fuel choice for industrial parks in Thailand. By utilizing a distributed \ngeneration model with combined-cycle and cogeneration technologies with heat recovery steam \ngenerators, electricity is produced more efficiently and in a more sustainable manner, providing \ncleaner air quality and lower carbon footprint within the industrial centers of Thailand. \n \n4. \nThailand\u2019s rapid industrialization and development fueled by natural gas have increased \nproductivity,  job  creation,  and  income for the country.  However,  due  to declining  reserves  and \ngreater reliance on imports, Thailand must now reprioritize its strategic use of natural gas within \n\n                                                \n1   Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nits energy fuel mix from a dominant to a transitioning fuel source to meet its growing demand. \nOver the next 20 years, natural gas will play a central role in helping Thailand transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. It will continue to be a significant component of Thailand\u2019s overall fuel mix and \nit  will  continue  to  be  the  preferred fuel  choice over  coal  in  providing  electricity  to  the  country\u2019s \nindustrial  base.  Natural  gas  will  also  play  a  supporting  role  in  helping  the  country  meet  its \nrenewable energy targets. By 2036, Thailand plans to integrate 3,002 megawatts (MW) of wind \nand 6,000 MW of solar power generation into the national grid. Natural gas is optimally suited to \ncomplement  intermittent  electricity  generation from  wind  and  solar  through  its  ability  to  rapidly \nscale production up or down on short notice to meet load requirements. This allows the system \noperator to balance load in a more effective and efficient manner that is not possible with coal \nand nuclear or seasonal hydro imports. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  implements  its  distributed  generation model  for  industrial  users \n5. \nthrough  the  small  power  producers  (SPPs)  program  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  through  the \nindependent power producers (IPPs) and very small power producers (VSPPs) programs. The \nIPP  program,  with  installed  capacities  greater  than  90  MW,  the  SPP  program  with  installed \ncapacities in the 10 MW\u201390 MW range, and the VSPP program with installed capacities less than \n10 MW, allow private sector developers to build, own, and operate power plants and enter into a \npower  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  state-owned  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT)  in the case  of the IPP  and  SPP  programs,  and  with  the Provincial  Electricity \nAuthority (PEA) or Metropolitan Electricity Authority in the case of the VSPP program. The Ministry \nof  Energy  allows  for  any  additional  capacity  from  power  plants  to  be  directly  sold  to  industrial \ncustomers through energy supply agreements. SPPs can also sell their excess steam to industrial \ncustomers that are located within close proximity to the power plant. Power plants located within \nindustrial  estates  provide  the  power  system  with  added  reliability  and  security  of  supply  for \nelectricity consumers. \n \n6. \nThe proposed investment in Gemstone, one of the largest IPPs in Thailand, supports the \ngeneral  expansion  of  power  generation  in  the  country,  especially  in  servicing  industrial \nconsumers. From 2007 to 2017, Gemstone has been highly successful in securing the largest \npipeline of IPP and SPP projects in Thailand through the government\u2019s competitive solicitation \nand proposals for new generation. At this time, the company is seeking an initial public offering \n(IPO) to raise funds in support of its current pipeline of projects and to expand its business into \nnew growth opportunities. Raising funds through an IPO provides the private sector with greater \naccess  to  capital  in  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  manner,  enabling  it  to  undertake  more  and \nlarger investments in infrastructure projects. Gemstone is one of the largest private sector clients \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  with a longstanding relationship since 2007 when ADB \nsupported the company during its first IPP bidding process.2 \n \n7. \nProject design. Gemstone has a substantial number of projects under development and \nin construction, including (i) 2 gas-fired IPPs (5,570 MW), (ii) 11 gas-fired SPPs (1,427 MW), and \n(iii) 1 biomass SPP (25 MW). \n\n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\n                                                \n2  ADB provided long-term debt for two of Gemstone\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) projects, the Nong-Saeng \nNatural Gas Power Project and the Ayudhaya Natural Gas Power Project (1,600 MW each), which represented the \nfirst  project  financing  arrangements  in  Thailand  with  loan  tenures  of  23  years.  The  Nong-Saeng  Project  was \nrecognized  as  one  of  the  top  40  Public-Private  Partnerships  in  Emerging  Markets  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation and Infrastructure Journal, and the Ayudhaya Project received Project Finance Deal of the Year (2012) \nfrom Project Finance International. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n8. \nThailand is the second largest energy consumer in Southeast Asia, and over the next 20 \nyears the country must retire approximately 24,000 MW of capacity due to aging and inefficient \nplants,  and  add  approximately  51,500  MW  of  new  capacity  between  2016  and  2036  to  meet \ngrowing demand. Thailand will effectively more than double its current installed capacity of 30,218 \nMW  with  new  power  generation.  In  addition  to  its  current  projects  under  development  and \nconstruction, Gemstone will continue to expand its power project portfolio domestically through \ntenders and proposals for the IPP, SPP, and VSPP programs. The company will also seek growth \nopportunities to expand its renewable energy generation profile, and explore other opportunities \noutside  of  Thailand  where  it  can  leverage  its  proven  track  record  in  Thailand.  This  will  help \ndiversify the company\u2019s source of revenue and sustain the growth of its business operations. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n9. \nInvestee.  Gemstone\u2019s  business  has  been  primarily  focused  on  developing  natural  gas \npower generation in Thailand under the IPP and SPP programs. Currently, 99% of the company\u2019s \nportfolio consists of natural gas power generation, and the majority of the projects are located in \nor near industrial estates in Thailand. Since 2007, the company has submitted and won bids and \nproposals  under  the  IPP,  SPP,  and  VSPP  solicitation  programs  in  Thailand  for  a  total  of  28 \nprojects, of which 23 are based within industrial estates.  \n\n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n10. \nIn  line  with  the  government  strategy  to  transition  towards  a  low-carbon  economy, \nGemstone  has  begun  developing  renewable  energy  projects.  The  company  currently  has  four \nrooftop-solar solar projects in operation located in industrial parks and is currently developing a \nbiomass power project in Southern Thailand. The company also acquired a 9.09% equity interest \nin  SPCG, 3 one  of  the  largest  solar  power  companies  in  Thailand  with  260  MW  of  installed \ngeneration. As part of Gemstone\u2019s growth and diversification strategy, the company will pursue \nmore renewable energy generation projects in the future. \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.4 No  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity \n11. \nrisks were identified.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,6 which reaffirmed ADB\u2019s support for (i) the role of the \nprivate sector in meeting growing demand for clean energy in the region; (ii) poverty reduction by \nsupporting  rapid  and  inclusive  growth;  (iii)  capitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in \ninfrastructure development and finance; and (iv) supporting public\u2013private partnership initiatives. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  latest  country  partnership  strategy  for  Thailand, \n16. \n2013\u20132016, as well as its country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019, both of which prioritize: \n(i) increasing clean power generation capacity, (ii) increasing efficiency of energy generation, (iii) \npublic\u2013private partnerships, and (iv) development of capital markets. \n \n17. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, 7 which gives emphasis to investments in energy efficiency, \nleast-cost  supply,  private  sector  participation,  and  wider  access  to  the  poor.  ADB  supports \nprojects that utilize efficient technologies, such as combined cycle, and projects that incorporate \nstate-of-the-art emission control equipment. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n\nOfftake arrangements  Different tariff structures are applied based on the type of electricity-generating program \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nThe IPP and SPP programs allow for private developers to build, own, and operate power \ngeneration projects in the 10 MW\u201390 MW installed capacity range in the case of SPP, and \ngreater than 90 MW in the case of IPPs. IPP and SPP projects enter into long-term PPAs \nwith EGAT for up to 25 years. The VSPP program allows for private developers to build, \nown, and operate small power projects up to 10 MW of installed generating capacity.

As  a  cornerstone  investor,  ADB  will  help  facilitate  the  book-building  process  by \nreassuring other potential investors of the merits of the investment. ADB will also help strengthen \nits  corporate-wide  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and good international practice. Companies engaged in large \ninfrastructure  projects  depend  on  substantial  amounts  of  capital  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational  sources.  Financiers  and  investors  are  increasingly  cognizant  of  the  commercial \nimplications  associated  with  environmental  and  social  risks  as  well  as  reputational  risks \nassociated with their investment. The link between strong financial performance and a company\u2019s \ncorporate governance and ability to manage environmental and social risks of its business are \nbecoming more evident in ensuring the long-term corporate sustainability of a company. Providers \nof capital are increasingly rewarding companies that are accountable, transparent, and engage \nstakeholders and the communities in which they operate. \n \n20. \nFor companies that develop large-scale infrastructure projects in developing countries, an \nESMS  can  also  provide  a  strategic  competitive  advantage  in  securing  new  projects,  raising \ncapital, and improving brand image and reputation. These companies can achieve better growth \nopportunities,  cost  savings,  and  boost  their  bottom  line  profitability.  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  is  globally  recognized  as  a  leading  benchmark  for  good  environmental  and  social \nmanagement, and the company will adopt an ADB-compliant ESMS before ADB\u2019s cornerstone \n\n \n\n\finvestment in the IPO.9 The ESMS will strengthen Gemstone\u2019s capacity to mitigate environmental \nand social risks, improve relations with its stakeholders, and achieve greater development impact \nin the countries in which it operates. Further, the ESMS is also expected to help the company \nbecome ISO 14001 certified. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe investment is a general corporate finance transaction and is classified as category A \nfor  environment  and  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the investment have been identified and effective measures \nto avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated into the \nsafeguard reports and plans. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n22. \nA  corporate  audit  was  undertaken  by  an  external  third  party  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.10 The  corporate  audit  assessed  that  the \nenvironment,  health,  and  safety  (EHS) function is  embedded  in the  business  processes  of the \ncompany and works very closely with various teams (planning, development, and operations) to \nensure  both  statutory  compliance  and  management  of  risks.  The  EHS  teams  are  staffed  with \ndedicated  and  qualified  personnel  who  have  developed  a  comprehensive  set  of  systems  and \nprocedures which govern the overall EHS management at both corporate and subproject levels. \nMonitoring, reporting, and documentation of EHS performance are tracked and integrated into the \nmanagement review system and process of the company. In addition, the company\u2019s subprojects \nwere also certified for International Organization for Standardization systems, demonstrating its \nwillingness to adopt and move towards meeting international standards requirements. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n23. \nThese and other audit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed \nin a corrective action plan. In line with the requirements of the corrective action plan, Gemstone \nwill  update  its  ESMS  and  align  it  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The \nenvironment and social requirements in the ESMS (categorization checklists, initial environmental \nexamination, and environmental impact assessment reports, social audit report, disclosure, and \ninternal as well as third-party reporting) will be mandatory for all future subprojects utilizing the \nADB  proceeds.
