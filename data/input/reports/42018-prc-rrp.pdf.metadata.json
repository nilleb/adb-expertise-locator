A summary of the environmental impact assessment \nwas  circulated \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  made  public  through  the  ADB \nwebsite on 4 July 2009. \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  Anhui  Province,  one  of  the  poorest \nareas in the PRC. Its per capita gross domestic product was 64% \nof the national average in 2007; the province ranked 27th among \nthe country\u2019s 31 administrative areas. The Project is designed to \npromote  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development  in  Anhui, \nand \nenvironmental \nimprove \nsustainability.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to an integrated road transport system \nin Anhui by (i) constructing a 139-kilometer (km) expressway and \nfacilities  between  Xuzhou  and  Mingguang; \nassociated \n(ii) upgrading,  rehabilitating,  and  providing  safety  measures  on \n452 km of existing local roads; (iii) improving village bus services \nin poorer areas; and (iv) providing institutional strengthening and \nthe  Anhui  Provincial  Department  of \ncapacity  building \nTransport \nrelated  agencies,  and  Anhui \nits \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited (ACIG). \n \nThe  underdeveloped  transport  system  and  associated  high \ntransportation  costs  are  major  barriers  to  poverty  reduction  in \nAnhui.  Rural  poverty  incidence  is  high  in  the  project  area, \nparticularly in Huaibei Plain in the north and Dabie Mountain area \nin the south. Lower transportation costs and enhanced transport \nsector management will promote inter- and intraprovincial trade, \nencourage  investment  in  the  project  area,  create  jobs,  and \nincrease competitiveness. \n \nThe Project will contribute to ADB's country partnership strategy \nfor  the  PRC  (2008\u20132010).  It  will  help  (i)  improve  connectivity, \ncompetitiveness, and balanced development in Anhui; (ii) reduce \npoverty  by  expanding  affordable  access  to  markets,  services, \nand other job opportunities to the poor; and (iii) manage resource \nscarcity  and  environmental  challenges  by  improving  transport \nplanning, environmental supervision, and resource optimization. \n \n\nfor \n(APDOT), \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nto \n\n(v) \n\nIt  will \n\nregional \n\nimproving \n\nintegration \n\nstrengthen \n\nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy,  which \nfocuses  on  (i)  financing  new  roads  that  connect  major  growth \ncenters, supported by a system of local roads; (ii) developing and \nimproving  urban  transport  and  rural  roads;  (iii)  promoting  road \nsafety,  (iv)  reducing  vehicle  emissions  and  increasing  energy \nthe  commercial  orientation  and \nefficiency; \nefficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (vi) promoting \nsustainable transport.  \n \nThe  Project  is  accorded  priority  in  the  Government's  11th  Five-\nYear  Plan,  and  forms  an  integral  part  of  the  planned  network \nformulated  under  the  Government's  central  region  development \nstrategy. \nand \ncompetitiveness  of  Anhui.  It  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s \ndevelopment  priorities  to  reduce  regional  disparities  between \ninland and coastal regions, and between rural and urban areas.  \n \nThe Project will enhance transport sector management in Anhui. \nIt will (i) contribute to an integrated transport network across the \nprovince;  (ii)  initiate  a  comprehensive  safety  enhancement \nprogram to mitigate the accident risks associated with the project \nroad  improvement  program;  (iii)  integrate  a  village  bus  services \ndemonstration  project \nfoster  better,  safer,  and  more \nresponsive  bus  services  in  rural  areas;  (iv)  promote  resource \noptimization;  and  (v)  improve  environment,  health,  and  safety \nmanagement  by  appointing  an \nindependent  environmental \nsupervision team during implementation. \n \nThrough  the  Project,  ADB  is  supporting  APDOT  in  building  its \ncapacity  for  sound  public  policy  choice  and  implementation. \nDuring project preparation, ADB provided advice on the merit of \nvarious  project  alternatives  and  this  helped  APDOT  to  improve \nthe  design  of  the  Project.  ADB  helped  APDOT  update  policies \nand  services  to  deliver  transport  in  an  economically,  financially, \nenvironmentally, and socially sustainable manner. \n \nThe Project will contribute to an integrated road transport system \nto support the Central Region Development Strategy. This will be \nachieved  by  developing  an  efficient,  affordable,  safe,  and \nsustainable  transport  system  to  promote  inclusive  growth  and \nbalanced  development,  and  improve  resource  efficiency  and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,355.0 \nmillion,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $45.7  million.  Of  the \n$200.0 million  ADB  loan,  $118.5  million  will  finance  the  project \nexpressway  component,  $80.0  million  will  finance  the  local \nroads,  safety,  and  village  bus  services  demonstration \ninstitutional \ncomponents;  and  $1.5 million  will \nstrengthening component. \n\nfinance \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nDomestic Bank Loans \nMinistry of Transport  \nAnhui Communications Investment Group \n  Company Limited \nAnhui Provincial People\u2019s Government  \n \n\nTotal\n\n \n\niii \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n200.0 \n598.8 \n119.1 \n \n320.9 \n116.2 \n1,355.0\n\n \n\nloan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by \n\n \nA  loan  of  $200,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.

The existing Foreign Fund Project \nManagement  Office  (PMO)  established  within  APDOT  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  Within  APDOT, \nthe  project  activities  will  be  coordinated  by  three  implementing \nagencies:  ACIG,  Anhui  Highway  Administration  Bureau,  and \nAnhui  Transportation  Administration  Bureau,  under  the  overall \ndirection  of  the  PMO.  APDOT,  through  the  PMO,  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building. \n \nGoods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).

On  21  July  2009, \nADB  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for \neligible expenditures not exceeding $40 million. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  20  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services to provide advice on road safety, road asset \nmanagement, \nservices,  and  environmental \nmanagement.  The  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  also  finance  national  consulting  services  for \n(i) village  bus  services  demonstration  project  supervision; \n(ii) local  road  traffic  safety  program  supervision;  and  (iii) a  road \nsector  financing  and  maintenance  study,  each  at  an  estimated \ncost  of  no  more \nrequired  national \nthan  $100,000.  The \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. In addition, APDOT will engage and \nfinance  6,000 person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All \nnational  consultants,  not  financed  by  ADB,  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  high-priority  projects  identified  by  the \nCentral  Region  Development  Strategy.  It  will  have  a  significant \nimpact  on  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the \ncentral and western regions. \n \nThe  Project  will  help \nintraprovincial \nreduce \ndevelopment disparities to promote harmonized and coordinated \ndevelopment.  Specifically,  it  will  provide  an  efficient,  safe,  and \nsustainable road transport system in Anhui to (i) reduce transport \ntime  and  costs,  and  thereby  promote  inter-  and  intraprovincial \ntrade  and  reduce  regional  development  gaps;  (ii)  encourage \ninvestment in the project area, create jobs, and increase incomes \nfor  the  poor;  (iii)  reduce  vehicle  emissions,  traffic  noise,  and \ntraffic  accident  rates;  (iv)  improve  public  transport  services  and \nquality  of  life  for  rural  poor,  and  (v)  strengthen  sector  planning \nand development capacity. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  transport  time  and  costs.  It  will  facilitate \nlocal urbanization, allow industry to be more economically viable \nalong  the  transport  corridor,  add  value  to  agriculture  products \nthrough  better  market  access,  and  improve  access  to  social \nservices including education and health care. \n \n\ninter-  and \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nthe  project \n\nThe Project will reduce fuel consumption, improve transportation \nconditions,  shorten  travel  time,  and  improve  safety.  It  will  help \nreduce  vehicle  emissions,  congestion,  traffic  noise,  and  traffic \naccident rates. \n \nThe Project will benefit 4 million people in 14 counties, of which \nsix counties  are  officially  designated  poverty \ncounties. \nSpecifically,  as  a  result  of \ntransport  corridor \nimprovement, two poor counties in the northeast of the province \nwill gain improved accessibility, with better connections to major \nmarket centers and to development opportunities in neighboring \nJiangsu Province. \n \nA  substantial  local  road  network  will  be  improved,  through \nselective  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  damaged  roads,  so  as \nto  serve  the  mobility  needs  of  local  communities.  It  will  better \nintegrate  poor  and  underdeveloped  counties  into  the  provincial \neconomy. \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  APG  to  better  manage  the  major \nchallenges in the transport sector, notably through application of \nroad  safety  good  practices,  introduction  of  rural  village  bus \nservice reforms, and preparation of recommendations for a road \nmaintenance  financing  framework  to  ensure  sustainable  road \nmaintenance. \n \nThe  Project \njustified.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n15.8%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  expressway \ncomponent  is  6.6%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage cost of capital. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  (e.g.,  passengers, \ntraders,  transport  providers,  and  bus  and  truck  operators),  as \nwell  as  labor,  the  local  economy,  and  the  private  sector.  Rural \nhouseholds  will  be  important  beneficiaries\u2014from  increased \nincomes through better access to roads, services, markets, jobs, \nand other off-farm opportunities. \n \nOverall, the project risk is rated low. The Project is formulated to \nreduce  financial,  safety,  and  social  risks.  These  were  assessed \nand mitigating measures provided. \n \n\nis  economically  and \n\nfinancially \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nfunds, \n\nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  The \nproject design considered potential financial and social risks. All \nlocal roads under the Project will be toll free. A financial analysis \nwas  conducted  of  provincial  revenues,  including  availability  of \nsufficient  counterpart \nfuture  maintenance  and \noperating  expenses,  as  well  as  the  loan  repayments.  This \nreveals that the fiscal impact and financial risks of the Project are \nlow. Social issues include land acquisition and resettlement, road \nsafety,  and  prevention  of  transmissible  diseases.  Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plans, road \nand \ntraffic  management  designs,  and  disease  prevention \nawareness program. \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  in  timely  approvals  of  the \nrecommended  regulatory  changes  of  the  village  bus  licensing \nsystem  is  addressed  by  establishing  a  project  development \ngroup in each county to act as an implementing unit. The project \ndevelopment  group  will  have  authority \nrecommend \nimplementation  of  regulatory  changes.  Consulting  services  will \nbe  provided  during  implementation  to  develop  and  agree  on \nnecessary  procedures  and  documentation.  Training  programs \nwill be designed for bus operators and regulators to train them in \nthe  new  procedures.  ADB  will  continue  dialogue  with  APG  and \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nInclusive Growth and Balanced Development \n\n \n2. \nThe  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  poverty  reduction  since  the  late  1970s. \nHowever, it still has the second largest number of consumption poor in the world. In 2005, it still \nhad  254  million  people  consuming  less  than  $1.25  a  day  (in  2005  purchasing  power  parity \ndollars).1 Poverty is more widespread in the central and western region. Income inequality has \nincreased  significantly,  and  disparities  remain  and  in  some  cases  have  grown.  The  task  of \npoverty  reduction  continues.  Government  policy  has  been  rapidly  evolving  in  response  to  the \nchallenges,  and  a  broader  poverty  reduction  agenda  has  been  taking  shape.  In  particular, \ninclusive growth and balanced regional development are emphasized as the long-term national \ndevelopment  strategy  to  close  the  widening  development  gap  between  inland  and  coastal \nprovinces, and between rural and urban areas. \n \n3. \nAnhui Province has a population of 66.8 million\u201461% are classified as rural, higher than \nthe  national  average  of  55%.  The  population  density  of  470  people  per  square  kilometer  is \nsignificantly higher than the national average of 138. With per capita gross domestic product at \n64% of the national average in 2007, Anhui ranked 27th among the country\u2019s 31 administrative \nareas.  It  has  19  officially  designated  national  poverty  counties  and  10  provincial  poverty \ncounties,  accounting  for  47.5%  of  the  counties  in  the  province.  In  2007,  the  annual  per capita \nnet income of rural households was CNY3,556, while the annual per capita disposable income \nof  urban  households  was  CNY11,473,  three  times  more  than  that  of  rural  households.  Rural \nincome poverty incidence is 10.5%.2 Poverty and urban\u2013rural disparity are the two major issues. \nInadequate  road  infrastructure  and  associated  high  transport  costs  are  major  barriers  to  the \nreduction of poverty and disparity in Anhui. \n \n4. \nDespite  its  strategic  location,  Anhui  is  the  least  developed  province  in  central  PRC. \nPoverty in Anhui is concentrated in Huaibei Plain in the north and Dabie Mountain area in the \nsouth.  Huaibei  Plain  is  a  major  grain  production  area;  however  it  is  flood-prone,  which  limits \nintensification  of  farming.  The  main  causes  of  poverty  in  Huaibei  Plain  are  high  population \ndensity  and  limited  nonfarm  employment,  which  results  in  a  large  surplus  of  rural  laborers. \nBecause of its remoteness and isolation, the resources and income-generating opportunities of \nthe  Dabie  Mountain  area  are  limited.  Lack  of  transport  accessibility  and  connectivity  constrain \nsocioeconomic development of the northern and southern mountainous areas. \n \nProvinces  along  the  coastline  have  benefited  from  logistical  accessibility  and  well-\n5. \ndeveloped  infrastructure,  thereby  growing  more  quickly  than  the  central  and  western  regions. \nThe central region grew at a slower pace than the rest of the PRC in the 1990s. Aware of the \nimportance of coordinated and harmonized development between eastern, central, and western \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  2009.  From  Poor  Areas  to  Poor  People:  China\u2019s  Evolving  Poverty  Reduction  Agenda.  Washington, \n\n2   Rural  income  poverty  incidence  in  Anhui  is  much  higher  than  in  eastern  neighboring  provinces  (1%\u20132%)  and \n\nwestern and southern neighboring ones (5.0%\u20138.6%). \n\nDC.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nprovinces,  the  Government  formulated  the  Central  Region  Development  Strategy  in  2004. \nTransport  is  one  of  the  high  priorities  of  the  strategy.  A  well-developed  transport  network  will \nhelp  the  central  region  capitalize  on  its  strategic  location  and  transform  it  into  a  major  hub \nlinking east and west, and north and south. Anhui is a key central region province and is well \nlocated to benefit from the strategy and spillover effects from neighboring coastal provinces. \n \n6. \nThe  Anhui  Provincial  People's  Government  (APG)  put  forward  its  own  strategy  of \nDevelopment  to  the  East,  aiming  to  promote  links  with  the  more  affluent  eastern  provinces \n(Jiangsu and Zhejiang) to reduce regional development gaps. The strategy assigns high priority \nto  eastward  transport  development  as  a  way  to  narrow  the  widening  regional  development \ngaps  by  increasing  passenger  and  freight  movements  with  eastern  provinces,  and  attracting \nmore  investment  to  Anhui.  It  will  also  link  passenger  and  freight  movements  from  western \nprovinces to eastern provinces. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Road Subsector \n\n \nSince  1998,  the  PRC  has  invested  about  5%  of  its  gross  domestic  product  in  the \n7. \ntransport  sector,  65%  of  which  was  for  roads.  The  growth  of  road  assets  has  exceeded  the \ngrowth  rate  of  the  economy;  this  has  helped  bridge  the  country's  infrastructure  gap.3 Overall, \ntransport  investments  have  been  a  constant  factor  in  fostering  and  spreading  growth  from  the \neastern to the inland regions of the PRC, and facilitating poverty reduction. Development of the \nnational transport networks has been accompanied by continuing development of the secondary \nand  tertiary  transport  networks  to  provide  improved  connectivity  and  quality  of  access.  From \n1990 to 2006, during the period of the 8th, 9th, and 10th five-year plans, the PRC completed the \nconstruction  of  nearly  44,000 kilometers  (km)  of  high-grade  tolled  expressways.  During  that \nperiod, about 400,000 km of local and rural roads were also improved. \n \n8. \nAnhui, with a land area of 139,400 square kilometers, is a landlocked province in central \nPRC. Roads are the main transport mode.4 Between 2003 and 2007, transport demand in Anhui \ngrew  at  8.5%  per  annum  (8.4%  for  freight  and  8.8%  for  passengers).  All  modes  of  transport \nhave  experienced  rapid  growth  in  demand.  Roads  now  carry  most  of  the  passengers  (64%  of \npassenger-km in 2007), while railways and inland waterways are the preferred modes for freight \ntransport,  especially  for  long-haul  bulk  goods.  Road  transport  plays  an  essential  role  in  the \ncollection  and  distribution  system  (roads  were  used  to  collect  and  distribute  75%  of  cargo \ntonnage  in  2007).  Increasing  demand  for  mobility  and  accessibility  will  require  upgrading  of \ninfrastructure  capacity  as  is  reflected  in  long-term  plans.  The  sector's  policy  and  institutional \ndevelopment also needs to be strengthened to respond to changing and growing demand. \n \n9. \nThe province's road network is relatively dense but only provides low levels of service to \nthe population. The total length of roads per capita is in line with the national average. However, \nthe capacity and quality of the roads in Anhui is inadequate. As of 2007, the length of (i) main \nhighways (class II or above) was 12,392 km (8.4%), lower than the national average of 10.6%; \nand (ii) arterial roads (class I) was 360 km; only 44% of the network is paved. The network also \nhas  an  unbalanced  geographic  distribution.  In  particular,  the  densely  populated  poor  northern \ncounties  and  the  mountainous  areas  in  the  south  have  only  limited  access  to  the  highway \nnetworks. This lack of transport accessibility prevents a considerable portion of the population \nfrom fully benefiting from the region's ongoing development. \n\n                                                 \n3  The  \"infrastructure  gap\u201d  is  the  difference  between  the  existing  asset  base  and  the  asset  base  required  by  the \n\n4  In 2007, Anhui had 5,600 km of navigable waterways, 2,400 km of railways, and 148,000 km of roads. The modal \nsplit  for  passenger-km  was  63.8%  for  roads,  36.1%  for  railways,  0.1%  for  inland  waterways.  The  modal  split  for \nfreight ton-km was 50.1% for railways, 27.3% for roads, and 22.6% for inland waterways. \n\neconomy. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges and Opportunities \n\n \n10. \nThe  national  fuel  taxation  reform  has  been  fully  applied  in  Anhui  Province  since  early \n2009. Six categories of fees levied on drivers were abolished, including an annual tax computed \nby  the  number  of  seats  per  car  and  a  surcharge  on  passengers  and  freight  carried  by  boats. \nTolls on class II roads were also removed in pilot provinces including Anhui. In their place, the \ncentral Government has introduced a national fuel surcharge of CNY0.8 per liter for diesel and \nCNY1.0 per liter for gasoline since 1 January 2009. This will bring the pricing system for roads \ncloser to a pay-as-you-go mechanism. The additional fuel tax revenues are being used in part to \nmaintain and manage roads and waterways, and to help compensate local governments for lost \nincome from eliminated tolls and fees. It is an efficient mechanism to collect road user fees, and \nprovides an incentive to lower fuel consumption and promote vehicle fuel efficiency. It will bring \nlong-term  gains  to  the  financial  and  environmental  sustainability  of  the  road  transport  system. \nAs the central Government collects the fuel tax, proper distribution channels and mechanisms \nare essential for allocating these tax revenues to the transport sector to ensure that funding is \navailable for maintenance of the road network and debt servicing for class II roads. This reform \nwill profoundly transform the financing framework of the sector, and enhance the transparency \nand accountability of road administrations.  \n \n11. \nRoad  safety  remains  a  major  issue  in  the  PRC,  with  73,500  fatalities  reported  in  2008 \n(down from 100,000 in 2000). Road accidents are the second leading cause of premature death \nin the PRC, and the leading cause of death in the 15\u201345 year age group. A road accident can \ntake  a  family  from  self-sufficiency  to  poverty,  especially  if  the  victim  is  the  family\u2019s  main \nbreadwinner.  Reducing  threats  to  life  and  health  is  therefore  accorded  high  priority.  The \nintroduction of the National Road Safety Law in 2004 encouraged a greater focus on road safety, \nand required the setting up of provincial road safety committees. The road safety situation has \nimproved  steadily  but  remains  challenging  as  motorization  increases.  Practices  and  policies \nmust be improved to reduce the number of fatalities and severity of injuries on the roads. \n \n12. \nIn  2008,  more  than  8,400  reported  traffic  accidents  claimed  3,000  lives  and  more  than \n10,000  casualties  in  Anhui.  The  severity  of  accidents  is  high  as  shown  by  the  average  of \n1.6 fatalities  and  injuries  in  each  accident.  Road  safety  risks  on  low-grade  roads  remain  high \nbecause  most  were  built  at  a  time  when  little  attention  was  given  to  safe  design.  Safety  is  of \ngreat  concern  to  local  communities.  Comments  received  during  field  surveys  centered  on  the \nneed to apply \"traffic calming\" measures such as \u201cgo slow\u201d signs and rumble devices for local \nroads  traversing  communities.  Other  concerns  include  poor  road  conditions,  poor  junction \ndesign and signage provisions, and poor pedestrian provisions. \n \nDespite  good  progress  in  providing  village  bus  services  connecting  townships  with \n13. \ncounties,  some  3,800  administrative  villages  still  have  no  formal  bus  service  in  Anhui.  This  is \ndue in part to the licensing and regulatory system, which restricts the provision of service unless \na  number  of  specific  conditions  are  met.  Transport  demand  in  these  circumstances  is  usually \nmet  by  various  unlicensed  transport  services,  often  using  vehicles  unsuitable  for  the  purpose, \nwhich  are  not  properly  maintained  and  are  not  always  driven  safely.  The  ADB  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services 5  outlined  how  the  PRC  could \nregularize the informal (unlicensed) bus operators to foster better rural bus services by setting \nup more flexible regulatory frameworks and reforming rural public transportation.

The  problem  and  constraints  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n\n2 \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n \nThe  Government\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  focuses  on  balanced,  equitable, \n14. \nand sustainable development.6 The Government pledges to increase farmers\u2019 incomes, improve \ninfrastructure, and enhance public services in the countryside. Transport development is a high \npriority as it is considered essential for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. The \ncentral region grew at a slower pace than the rest of the PRC in the 1990s. In 2004, the State \nCouncil  declared  the  development  of  the  central  region  a  priority  task  and  formulated  the \nCentral  Region  Development  Strategy.  To  achieve  this  strategy,  the  Government  has  stepped \nup  construction  of  transportation  infrastructure,  particularly  in  Anhui.  Pursuant  to  this,  the \nstrategy  of  APG  is  to  boost  eastward  development  and  rapidly  integrate  the  economy  with \nneighboring  provinces,  especially  the  wealthier  provinces  to  the  east.  The  Project  will  play \nimportant roles in fulfilling the Government strategy. \n \n15. \nThe theme of ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy for 2008\u20132010 is mainstreaming \ninclusive  growth  and  environmentally  sustainable  development.7 The  Project  is  consistent  with \nthe  strategy,  in  particular  its  main  strategic  pillars  of  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  (iii) support  for  the \nenvironment for private sector participation. The strategy also seeks to mainstream knowledge \nand innovation in projects by optimizing the use of TA.  \n \n\n3 \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\n \n16. \nThe  road  subsector  in  the  PRC  has  received  considerable  external  assistance.  Since \n1991, ADB has extended 38 loans totaling $7.7 billion to finance 5,270 km of expressways and \n11,194 km of associated local road networks. Project completion reports prepared for 22 road \nprojects  conclude  that  21  were  \u201chighly  successful\u201d  or  \u201cgenerally  successful,\u201d  and  1  \u201cpartly \nsuccessful.\u201d8 ADB advisory TA projects have addressed policy and institutional issues, including \nhighway  planning,  road  safety,  socioeconomic  assessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization \nof  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  about  $9.4  billion,  the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency about \u00a5195 billion, and the European Investment Bank \nand  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  provided  cofinancing  of  Euro  85  million  to  finance \nroad investments. ADB coordinates with these organizations to discuss progress and issues in \nthe sector, and meets regularly with the World Bank for coordination and information sharing. A \nsummary of development coordination to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons \n\n \n17. \nAlthough this is the first ADB road project in Anhui, ADB has several projects focusing \non railways, and the social and energy sectors. These projects have developed the capacity of \nAPG  and  local  governments  in  project  implementation.  The  project  design  benefited  from \nlessons  from  ADB's  2008  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  of  ADB  assistance  for  roads \n\n                                                 \n6  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2006.

The Project was subsequently rated \u201csuccessful\u201d in the project performance audit report. \n\n\f5 \n\nand  railways  in  the  PRC, 9 as  well  as  from  the  lessons  of  three  World  Bank-financed  road \nprojects in Anhui.10 The following lessons guided the design of the Project. \n \n18. \nStrategic  Integration  of  Local  Roads  in  Project  Scope.  International  financial \ninstitutions coupled expressway projects in the PRC with local road improvements on the basis \nthat  including  local  roads  would  increase  the  poverty  reduction  impacts.  However,  local  roads \nwould often have been constructed anyway, and those components complicated the institutional \nand  financial  arrangements  without  adding  value.  The  project  design  addresses  these  issues. \nBy  financing  a  significant  portion  of  APG's  local  road  program  in  areas  selected  for  support \nunder the Project, the Project will enable implementation of local roads in particularly poor areas \nto be completed much earlier than without an ADB project. The use of existing implementation \nmechanisms  will  eliminate  burdensome  institutional  or  financial  arrangements.  The  project\u2019s \nlocal  road  program  provides  an  opportunity  for  extended  dialogue  with  APG  on  improving \napproaches  to  planning,  designing,  and  financing  local  roads  and  providing  bus  services  on \nlocal roads. It also provides a demonstration effect of improved practices in the area of planning, \nresource optimization, and safety enhancements. \n \n19. \nSelectivity  in  Policy  Dialogue  Issues  to  Add  Value.  The  institutional  capacity  of \nprovincial  communications  departments  increased  substantially  in  1997\u20132008.  Many  of  the \npolicy and institutional investments supported by ADB have been adopted and institutionalized. \nADB should adopt more focused and in-depth engagement on features that can still add value. \nTo  gain  better  ownership,  institutional  strengthening  activities  and  policy  reforms  should  be \nlinked  with  investment  components.  The  project  value  addition  components  received  the  full \nsupport of the Anhui Provincial Department of Transport (APDOT) during project formulation.  \n \n20. \nLinks  between  Advisory  Work  and  Projects.  The  recommendations  of  several  ADB \nTA  projects  were  integrated  in  the  project  design,  in  particular:  (i)  the  Sustainable  Rural \nTransport Services TA provided the model for the village bus transport service reform and pilot \nprojects  (footnote  5);  (ii)  the  resource  optimization  TA 11  was  disseminated  to  APDOT  (the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  Project)  for  road  capacity  optimization  and  natural  resource \npreservation; (iii) the Resource Manual for Health and Safety in Infrastructure developed under \nan ADB TA12 was distributed to APDOT and will be piloted under the Project; (iv) the report of \nthe corporatization, leasing, and securitization TA13 was distributed to APDOT and will serve as \na  basis  for  exploring  private  participation  options  in  the  sector  during  the  Project;  and  (v)  in \naddition  to  conducting  project  design,  the  project  preparatory  TA 14  supported  some  initial \nimplementation  activities  of  the  road  safety  and  village  bus  services  components,  which  were \nappreciated by APG and local communities. \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nfinancing \n\n \n21. \nPolicy  dialogue  during  project  preparation  contributed  to  (i)  integrating  a  local  road \nnetwork  program  to  improve  accessibility  to  remote  and  low  income  areas,  (ii) integrating \nresource  optimization  and  environmental  sustainability  elements \nin  project  design, \nframework, \n(iii) incorporating  advisory  work  on  establishing  a  sustainable \n(iv) addressing  road  traffic  safety  issues,  (v)  initiating  sustainable  rural  village  bus  service \ndevelopment,  and  (vi)  facilitating  private  sector  participation.  The  policy  dialogue  matrix  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n22. \nExtended  dialogue  with  the  provincial  government  resulted  in  a  well-balanced  road \nconfiguration.  The  Project  will  build  an  expressway  to  help  realize  the  regional  economic \nopportunities available through expansion of interprovincial trade and socioeconomic integration \nwith  eastern  provinces,  and  will  address  local  road  network  deficiencies  by  including  a \nsubstantial  local  road improvement  program.  The  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  Expressway  (XME)  is  a \nkey element of the central region transport network and is a high-priority project in its 5-year plan. \nAPG considers the accessibility improvements to be a key component of its provincial poverty \nreduction plan and a key initiative to promote integrated rural and urban development. \n \n23. \nCareful  consideration  was  given  to  project  scale,  route  selection,  and  land  acquisition. \nAfter reviewing the traffic forecasts and expected capacity required, the scope of the XME was \nreduced  from  a  dual  three-lane  carriageway  to  a  dual  two-lane  carriageway.  In  addition,  the \ndesign  of  the  subgrade  width  for  the  two-lane  carriageway  was  reduced  from  28 meters  to \n27 meters.  The  total  cost  was  reduced  by  30%  as  a  result  of  this  optimization.  To  achieve  an \nenvironmentally acceptable alignment and minimize land acquisition, a section of the XME was \nrealigned to avoid the Tuo Lake Nature Reserve. \n \n24. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  Government  introduced  the  new  fuel  tax  and  removed \nvarious  existing  tolls  and  fees  (para.  10).  As  part  of  policy  dialogue,  ADB  shared  international \nexperiences  regarding  mechanisms  for  establishing  a  sustainable  road  financing  framework, \nincluding use of road asset management systems and establishing road funds. This led to the \ninclusion in the Project of a study to formulate a sustainable financing framework. \n \n25. \nAs part of an initial demonstration phase for the rural village bus services component of \nthe  Project,  APDOT  agreed  to  introduce  changes  in  the  organization  and  regulation  of  public \ntransport  services  in  the  selected  counties.  The  groundwork  for  the  demonstration  project \ncommenced in two townships (Shipai and Ducun). Formulation of this component was therefore \nable  to  take  into  account  the  reference  of  an  initial  phase  of  implementation,  which  helped  to \nensure that the component is realistic in its aim and adapted to the local setting. The Project will \ndemonstrate  how  the  reform  will  work,  and  involves  stakeholders  in  the  design  of  the  system \nand in monitoring its performance once it is in operation. \n \n26. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company \nLimited (ACIG) expressed interest in seeking private sector participation in the XME once it is \nbuilt. The Government  agreed to explore options including joint venture, asset securitization,15 \nand bond issue. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  The sale of highway equity through initial public offerings and private placements, as a substitute for long-term debt \n\nfinancing.  \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe impact of the Project will be an integrated road transport system that supports the \nCentral  Region  Development  Strategy.  This  will  be  achieved  through  provision  of  an  efficient, \nsafe,  and  sustainable  road  transport  system  to  promote  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment, and improve resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \nThe Project will benefit about 4.0 million people, of whom 90% are rural residents. The \nProject has three distinct locations, including eight municipalities and 14 counties and/or districts \n(see Map). The project description is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nOutput  1.  Improve  road  infrastructure  in  the  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  corridor \n(component A). The Project will expand the road capacity in northeast Anhui by \nconstructing  a  new  139  km,  four-lane,  access  controlled  XME  with  a  design \nspeed  of  120 km/hour.16 The  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $995.4  million,  of \nwhich ADB will finance $118.5 million. \n\nOutput 2. Improve local roads and traffic safety practices (component B). A total \nof 452 km of local roads will be upgraded or rehabilitated. Traffic safety design, \noperation,  and  management  practices  on  these  existing  local  roads  will  be \nimproved. The local roads are identified either as key links for interprovincial and \nintercounty roads, or as critical missing links in the road networks in low-income \nareas.  The  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $356.1 million,  of  which  ADB  will \nfinance $79.8 million. \n\nOutput  3.  Improve  rural  village  bus  services  (component  C).  As  suggested  by \nthe  ADB  TA  on  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services  (footnote 5),  APDOT  will \nintroduce  village  bus  licensing  reform  consisting  of  vehicle  license,  operator's \nlicense, and route license for all bus services in project townships (Shipai, Ducun, \nand  Xiaowei).  The  component  will  (a) develop  local  bus  operators  based  in  the \nthree townships, which will have the right to provide a coordinated network of bus \nservices  to  the  surrounding  villages;  and  (b)  amend  the  licensing  regulations \napplicable to bus services between townships and villages, and between villages, \nto  permit  greater  flexibility  in  the  use  of  vehicles,  fares  charged,  and  type  of \nvehicles  used.  The  Project  will  also  finance  the  setting  up  of  small-scale  bus \nstations, and bus shelters and stops in the three selected project townships. The \ncomponent is estimated to cost $2 million, of which ADB will finance $200,000. \n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nOutput  4:  Strengthen \n(a) improve \nmaintenance financing by preparing concept, feasibility analysis, and action plan \nfor  the  creation  of  a  new  financial  framework  for  recommendation  by  APG;  and \n(b)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  by  providing  international  and  on-the-job \ntraining to APDOT, its related agencies, and ACIG staff notably involved in road \nsafety,  maintenance,  public  transport  services,  private  sector  participation,  and \n\n(component  D): \n\n                                                 \n16  The  start  point  of  the  XME  is  the  provincial  border  with  Jiangsu  Province  in  the  north,  with  a  4  km  extension  to \nconnect Xuzhou via the Xuzhou\u2013Huai'an Expressway, and it ends at an interchange in Mingguang on the Bengbu\u2013\nNanjing Expressway in the south. Based on an agreement reached between the Jiangsu and Anhui governments \non 4 May 2009, Jiangsu will finance and complete the 4 km link by 2013. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n\f8 \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nenvironment  management.  ADB  will  finance  the  estimated  component  cost  of \n$1.5 million. \n\nThe  Project  is  designed  according  to  the  principles  of  sustainable  transport  to  provide \n29. \naccess  to  people,  places,  goods,  and  services  in  an  environmentally  responsible,  socially \nacceptable,  and  economically  and  financially  viable  manner.  Strategic  actions  and  features  to \nensure sustainability are addressed as an integral part of the project design. \n \n30. \nReinforce  Regional  Integration.  The  Project  is  designed  to  reduce  inter-  and \nintraprovincial development disparities. It will (i) strategically integrate Anhui Province with more \nprosperous  neighboring  provinces  to  the  east  thereby  supporting  trade  and  socioeconomic \nintegration  and  expanding  access  to  economic  opportunities;  (ii)  support  more  balanced \ndevelopment of all classes of road networks to contribute to the improvement of living conditions \nacross  the  province,  particularly  in  poverty  areas;  (iii)  enhance  transport  accessibility  and \nconnectivity by integrating a network of local roads into the trunk highway system and linking to \nmajor  centers,  counties,  and  townships;  and  (iv)  incorporate  other  types  of  facilities  such  as \nwalkways and bike paths for pedestrians to benefit local communities. In particular, the Project \nwill contribute to economic and social integration by facilitating the mobility of people, goods, and \nservices; and attracting more investment to the interior. \n \n31. \nFormulate  a  Sustainable  Financing  Framework. Efficient road asset management is \nessential to ensure sustainability. APDOT is committed to ensuring sufficient funding to maintain \nthe local project roads with good or fair services. To assist APG in developing its approach to \nutilization  of  fuel  tax  revenues,  the  Project  will  finance  a  study  to  develop  a  new  financing \nframework  for  road  maintenance  and  debt  repayment.  It  will  facilitate  the  development  of  a \nprovincial road fund. APG is committed to allocating a growing share of its road budgets to road \nmaintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  institutional  strengthening.  In  parallel,  APDOT  will  investigate \noptions  for  developing  private  participation  in  the  road  subsector  through  corporatization, \nleasing, concessions, or securitization of its expressway assets. \n \nInitiate  a  Comprehensive  Safety  Enhancement  Program.  To  mitigate  accident  risks \n32. \nassociated with local road improvement, the Project will (i) improve arrangements for traffic flow \nby  segregating  nonmotorized  and  vulnerable  traffic,  separating  opposing  traffic,  controlling \naccess,  and  ensuring  grade  separation;  (ii)  provide  better  junction  design  and  introduce \nchannelization at intersections; (iii) provide innovative road signs and markings; and (iv) provide \n\"traffic  calming\"  measures  to  reduce  traffic  speed  in  mixed  traffic  environments.  Road  safety \naudits  will  be  carried  out  during  design,  implementation,  operation,  and  evaluation.  Such \nproactive  approaches  will  yield  significant  safety  gains  at  a  cost  much  lower  than  would  be \nincurred  if  problems  were  to  be  added  later  in  \"black  spot\"  programs  of  remedial  works  at \nlocations with high accidents.  \n \n33. \nIntroduce the Village Bus Licensing System. Based on the reforms suggested by the \nADB  TA  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services  (footnote  5),  the  Project  will  (i) introduce  a \nvillage bus licensing system comprising vehicle licenses, operator licenses, and route licenses \nfor all bus services in project townships;17 (ii) select a suitable bus operator company for each \nproject township; (iii) provide exclusive authority to the selected bus operator companies on all \nlicensed routes; and (iv) approve the maximum limit of the bus fares suggested by the pricing \nbureaus  by  taking  into  account  all  cost  considerations.  APG  will  give  discretion  to  the  bus \n\n                                                 \n17  Implementation  has  started  in  Shi  Pai  township  (Huaining  county)  and  Du  Cun  township  (Qingyang  county),  and \n\nwill be carried out in Xiao Wei township (Wuhe county) during project implementation.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\noperator  companies  to  vary  the  fares  below  the  maximum  limit.  In  addition,  traffic  police  will \nenforce  all  traffic  regulations  in  the  project  townships,  in  particular  strict  restraint  on  running \nunlicensed vehicles. \n \n34. \nOptimize Resources. Drawing on the findings of the ADB TA for Resource Optimization \nin the Road Sector (footnote 11), project preparation drew upon a sustainable transport analysis \n(Appendix  6)  and  incorporates  a  package  of  measures  to  better  conserve  resources  including  \n(i)  recycle  existing  pavement  and  road  base  material  for  the  local  road  network  improvement \nprogram to reduce resource requirement and costs; (ii) reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and \nother pollutants by reducing fuel consumption as a result of a more optimal transport route and \nmore  efficient  driving  speeds  (Appendix  7);  (iii) reduce  noise  by  incorporating  low-noise \npavement,  noise  barriers,  and  noise  insulation  windows  in  the  detailed  design  of  the  XME;  \n(iv) require measures for topsoil preservation in the construction area and soil extraction areas \nto conserve soil materials required for agricultural activities; (v) include development of a waste \nmanagement  plan  to  identify  and  reduce  total  waste  generated  during  construction  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan;  (vi) implement  measures  to  reduce  water  consumption  and \navoid water wastage during construction; and (vii) appoint an independent environment, health, \nand  safety  supervisory  team  to  audit  and  provide  certified  reports  to  APDOT  and  ADB  on \nenvironment, health, and safety aspects of the project works. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,355  million,  including  financing  charges \n\n35. \nduring construction and taxes and duties (Table 1).

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice  from  ADB.  The  Government  will  finance  contingencies  and  financing  charges  during \nimplementation. \n \n37. \nThe ADB loan will finance 14.8% of the project cost. The remaining cost will be financed \nby the Ministry of Transport, APG, ACIG, and cofinancing through loans from the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China and Bank of China, which have appraised the Project and provided \ncommitment  letters  to  APDOT.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  APG  have  made  budgetary \nprovisions for the counterpart funds. The PRC will be the Borrower. The ADB loan proceeds will \nbe made available to APG on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The Government \nwill ensure that (i) APG onlends the ADB loan proceeds to APDOT; (ii) APG causes APDOT to \napply a portion of the loan proceeds in an amount of $81.5 million for components B, C, and D; \nand  (iii)  APG  causes  APDOT  to  onlend  a  portion  of  loan  proceeds  in  an  amount  of \n$118.5 million  to  ACIG  for  component  A.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  onlending \nagreements will be executed upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. APG and ACIG will \nbear the exchange rate and interest rate variation risks on the ADB loan. All onlending under the \nProject  will  be  on  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2.

The  existing  Foreign  Fund  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  within  APDOT  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  Within  APDOT,  the  project  activities  will  be \ncoordinated  by \n(component A),  Anhui  Highway \nAdministration Bureau (AHAB) (component B), and Anhui Transportation Administration Bureau \n(ATAB) (component C), under the overall direction of the PMO. APDOT, through the PMO, will \nbe  responsible  for  direct  implementation  of  component D.  The  PMO  will  oversee  project \nimplementation;  submit  progress,  audit,  and  other  reports  to  ADB;  and  manage  day-to-day \nactivities  in  connection  with  the  Project.  APDOT  and  ACIG  have  experience,  and  shown \nsatisfactory performance in implementing internationally financed projects. \n \n39. \nACIG  will  establish  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  company,  Xuming  Expressway \nManagement Company Limited, to implement component A. By 28 February 2010, the company \nis  to  be  duly  incorporated  under  the  Company  Law  of  the  PRC  as  ACIG's  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary.  ACIG  will  send  the  certificate  of  incorporation  and  shareholders  directory  to  ADB \nupon its incorporation. ACIG will be in charge of the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nXME with possible outsourcing of related activities. AHAB will manage the O&M for local project \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nroads.  The  PMO  will  manage  procurement  activities  on  behalf  of  the  three  implementing \nagencies. The organization chart is in Appendix 9. \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  5 years  from  mid-2010  to  mid-2015 \n40. \n(Appendix  10). Construction  of  the XME  is  expected  to  take  3  years.  The  individual  local  road \nand  safety  enhancement  subprojects  will  each  be  implemented  over  2  years,  with  the  overall \nprogram  of  such  improvements  spread  over  5  years;  implementation  of  the  rural  bus \ndemonstration project and capacity development components will take about 4 years. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \n41. \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) will be included in all bidding documents for the Project. Contracts for works \nestimated to cost $10.0 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Contracts for works estimated to cost less than the international competitive bidding \nthreshold but more than $200,000 will be procured on the basis of national competitive bidding \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  tendering  and  bidding  laws,  subject  to  modifications \nagreed with ADB. Contracts for works estimated to cost $200,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping  procedures.  Prior  review  will  be  applied  for  all  international  competitive  bidding \ncontracts,  the  first  national  competitive  bidding  contract  for works  and  goods,  and post  review \nfor  other  national  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  contracts.  Small  bus  stations,  stops,  and \nshelters financed by ADB will be procured through shopping procedures. Various thresholds for \ncontract  packages  are  set  out  in  Appendix 11.  A  full  procurement  plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  During  project  preparation,  ADB  assessed  the  PMO\u2019s  capacity  to  handle \nprocurement and found it to be acceptable. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n42. \nThe Project will finance 20 person-months of international consulting services, including \n5 person-months each for the following specialists: (i) road safety, (ii) rural village bus services, \n(iii)  road  asset  management,  and  (iv) environmental  management.  Considering  the  need  to \ncontinue  previous  work  carried  out  and  application  of  background  studies  and  analysis,  the \ninternational consultants engaged for preparing this Project under the project preparatory TA will \nbe recruited using individual consultant selection to provide support for the road safety and rural \nvillage bus services components. \n \n43. \nThe Project will also provide $300,000 ($100,000 for each of three activities) to finance \nnational  consulting  services  for  (i) supervision  of  the  rural  village  bus  services  demonstration \nproject, (ii) supervision of the local road traffic safety program, and (iii) the road sector financing \nstudy.  Given  the  very  small  contract  values  and  intensive  relevant  experience  of  the  two \nnational  firms18 proposed by  APDOT  for  the  project  consulting  services,  the  two  national  firms \nwill  be  selected  using  single-source  selection. For  the  roads  financing  study,  a  consulting  firm \nwill  be  engaged  based  on  a  simplified  technical  proposal  using  the  consultant's  qualifications \nselection method. In addition, APDOT will engage and entirely finance 6,000 person-months of \n\n                                                 \n18  Anhui  Communications  Vocational  and  Technical  College  undertook  the  preparation  of  the  rural  village  bus \nservices component under the project preparatory TA, and the terms of reference for the TA identified the related \nwork  during  implementation  as  a  continuation.  The  Anhui  Tongtai  Traffic  Engineering  Design  and  Research \nInstitute,  which  started  the  groundwork  of  local  road  safety  tasks  under  the  TA,  was  identified  to  continue  the \nrelated work during implementation.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n6. \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nnational  consultants  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All \nconsultants  financed  from  ADB  loan  resources  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n44. \nGiven the high priority accorded to the Project, on 21 July 2009 ADB approved advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  for  civil  works  and \nconsulting services not exceeding $40 million incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan  a  maximum  of  12  months  before  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  Advance  contracting \ncovers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, bid evaluation, and contract award. Advance \ncontracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment  was  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the Project. \n \n \n \n45. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Since  most  payments  will  be \nmade for large contracts, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw \nthe  loan  funds.  If  the  Government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify the documentation \nprocess,  Anhui  Provincial  Finance  Department  may  establish  and  manage  a  separate  imprest \naccount as required by APDOT after loan effectiveness. Anhui Provincial Finance Department \nhas  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  funds  based  on  financial  management  assessment \nrecommendations. Disbursement from the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate \nwithdrawal application and related documentation. The ceiling of the imprest account will be set \nas  either  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  next \n6 months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  account,  whichever  is  lower.19 The  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances \nprovided  into  the  imprest  account  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$200,000 in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n46. \nAPDOT will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project and related financial \nstatements.  The  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  maintained  in  accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices  as  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the \nPRC.  APDOT  will  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable \nto  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit  of \nsuch  financial  statements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and \ninternal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions, \nand (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the Project \nand  ADB's  requirements  on  project  management.  Within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  related \nfiscal year, APDOT will submit to ADB the project\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, \naudited project accounts, audit reports, and management letters in both English and Chinese. A \n\n                                                 \n19  The  bank  charges  incurred  in  the  imprest  account  will  be  financed  from  the  loan  amount,  in  line  with  the  ADB \nOperations  Manual  section  on  cost  sharing  and  eligibility  of  expenditures  for  ADB  financing.  ADB.  2008.  Cost \nSharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for ADB Financing. Operations Manual. OM Section H3/BP. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nseparate audit opinion on the use of the statement of expenditures and the imprest account, if \nany, will be included as part of the auditor's report.' \n \n47. \nTo  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project  construction  costs  and \noperations  are  effective,  APDOT  and  ACIG  will  use  its  internal  audit  unit  to  carry  out \nindependent  checks  during  project  implementation.  The  internal  audit  units  will  independently \ntest  financial  transactions  of  the  PMO  and  ACIG  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  the  project-\nfinanced  assets.  APDOT  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of \nproject  implementation  to  ADB  by  submitting  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  as  well  as  a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring \n48. \npracticalities  were  confirmed  and  agreed  with  APDOT  during  project  preparation.  The  key \nindicators and assumptions outlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and \nmonitoring of socioeconomic and poverty impacts are attached as Supplementary Appendix E, \nwhich  will  form  the  core  data  required  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  APDOT \nwill measure the indicators and report the key findings to ADB on project inception, during the \nmidterm review, at completion, and for 3 years thereafter. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n49. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  local  and  central  governments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan  and  project  agreements  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency;  ACIG; \nAHAB;  ATAB;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n50. \nAPDOT  and  ACIG  will  ensure,  during  project  implementation,  that  (i) officials  from  the \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  monitor  bidding  process,  construction,  and  operations  of  the \nProject;  (ii) the  internal  audit  unit  is  strengthened  in  ACIG  with  additional  staff  and  resources; \n(iii) a two-contract system is adopted where the winner of a civil works contract will also sign an \nanticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) periodic inspection of contractors is undertaken to \nensure  that  fund  withdrawal  and  settlement  procedures  are  followed;  and  (v)  the  status  of \nprocurement and award of contracts are published on APDOT\u2019s website. APDOT and ACIG will \ninitiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor's Office, as needed, to discuss any warnings about, \nor information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n51. \nIn  addition  to  regular  annual  reviews  by  ADB  staff,  a  detailed  midterm  review  of  the \nProject  is  scheduled  for  2  years  after  the  start  of  implementation.  The  review  will  cover  all \ninstitutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, financial, \nand  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  project\u2019s  performance  and  its \ncontinuing  viability.  It  will  identify  any  problems  or  weakness  in  implementation  arrangements, \nand agree on any changes needed to achieve the project objectives. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements \n\n52. \nThe  policy  and  institutional  improvement  activities  will  help  APDOT  (i)  prepare  and \nsubmit the road maintenance financing framework recommendations to APG for consideration, \n(ii) incorporate road safety audit recommendations in project road design to mitigate safety risks \nand  reduce  road  accident  rates,  and  (iii)  implement  rural  village  bus  services  licensing  and \noperation  reforms  in  three  pilot  townships  and  surrounding  villages.  The  component  will  also \nhelp  ACIG  establish  an  independent  environment,  health,  and  safety  team  to  provide  training \nand  information  to  the  construction  workforce,  and  to  impartially  review  and  audit  various \ncontractors  on  their  environmental,  health,  and  safety  practices.  These  activities  will  help \nsupport the sustainability of the Project. \n \nB. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n53. \nThe  XME  will  introduce  a  shorter  route  between  Xuzhou  and  Nanjing\u2014two  important \ntransport  hubs  in  the  PRC.  The  XME  will  increase  capacity  to  meet  transport  demand  on  the \nroute, release traffic congestion, and significantly reduce transport costs and travel times. The \ntraffic  projection  was  prepared  using  a  conventional  four-step  traffic  forecast  model.  An \nindependent  validation  of  the  assumption  was  used  in  the  traffic  modeling  for  the  feasibility \nstudy. A \"ramp-up\" factor was built in to take into account experience in previous projects that \ntraffic gradually builds up and the full potential traffic is not realized for a few years.20 Traffic on \nthe XME is forecast to grow from an average about 12,000 passenger car units per day in 2014 \nto an average of about 48,000 in 2033. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n54. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  by  comparing  scenarios \nwith  and  without  the  Project.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for \nconstruction including physical contingencies, land acquisition, and resettlement; (ii) O&M costs, \nincluding  replacing  depreciated  equipment  and  periodic  maintenance;  and  (iii) environmental \nmanagement and monitoring costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts  as  a  result  of  reduced  road  length,  and  improved  traffic  and  road  conditions;  (ii) time \nsavings  for  road  users;  (iii) savings  in  road  accident  costs  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents;  and \n(iv) savings  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  The  Project  is  economically  viable.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return is 15.8% for the whole Project, 15.5% for the XME, and 16.9% for the local \nroad component. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. \nThe economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\n55. \nThe project's financial analysis was prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines for the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 21  For  the  XME,  the  projected  financial \nstatements  indicate  that  financial  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  and  debt \nservicing  in  all  operating  years  and  provide  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  The  financial  internal \nrate  of  return  for  the  XME,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  6.6%  without  increasing  the \nexisting  toll  fee.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also \ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  3.7%.  The  XME  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project is viable even in adverse conditions. \n\n                                                 \n20 The feasibility study conducted by APDOT assumed about 15,000 passenger car units in 2014.  \n21  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nACIG is aware that the amount of expressway tolls and their regular review are important for the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  XME.  Six  months  prior  to  opening  the  XME,  ACIG  will  analyze  the \nfeasibility of accessing financial markets for future road sector investments, and possible private \nsector  participation  in  O&M  of  the  XME.  The  financial  analysis  and  projections  are  in \nAppendix 13. The financial management assessment of APDOT and the implementing agencies \nfound that they meet financial management requirements, and can provide accurate and timely \ninformation in the reports required by ADB (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nE. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n\n \n56. \nPoverty incidence in the project area is 10.5% on average, using a $1.25 a day poverty \nline  at  2005  purchasing  power  parity.22 Poverty  incidence  in  Yuexi,  which  will  benefit  directly \nfrom  the  rehabilitation  of  a  local  project  road  (S209),  is  29.5%.  The  XME23 and  upgrading  of \nlocal road X056 will directly benefit Lingbi and Sixian counties, which have poverty incidence of \n19.6%  and  18.0%,  respectively.  Six  national  or  provincial  poverty  counties  will  directly  benefit \nfrom the Project, accounting for 43% of the total project beneficiary counties. Consequently, the \nProject  will  facilitate  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  also  help  the  rural  poor  to  seek  more \nnonfarm  employment  opportunities.  Improved  access  to  eastern  provinces  will  attract  more \nlabor  intensive  industries  to  transfer  to  Anhui,  which  will  provide  additional  opportunities  for \nemployment for the surplus rural labor force. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  range  of  social  and  economic  benefits  for  local  people  and \ngovernments  including  (i)  transport  cost  and  time  savings;  (ii)  traffic  accident  cost  savings; \n(iii) improved  access  to  health  care  and  social  services;  (iv)  direct  job  opportunities  during \nconstruction  and  operation;  (v)  promotion  of  integrated  rural\u2013urban  development  through \nprovision of bypasses and road safety facilities in small towns; (vi) new countryside construction \nthrough  integrating  local  government  initiatives  with  the  project\u2019s  resettlement  work;  (vii) value \naddition  to  agricultural  production  through  better  access  to  regional  markets;  (viii) tourism \ndevelopment;  and  (ix)  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development, \nwhich  is  the  core  of  local  governments\u2019  master  plans.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy are in Appendix 14. \n \n58. \nAnhui has a large surplus rural labor force, which is a main cause of low rural income. \nThe Project will encourage the use of local labor and material supply during road construction, \nemploying about 440,000 person-months of local unskilled labor. About 20% of this employment \nfor unskilled labor is expected to go to the poor. This could then benefit an equivalent of some \n7,350  poor  laborers  or  households  with  some  31,000  people  over  4  years  (assuming  one \nunskilled laborer works 3 months a year). Consequently, this would bring additional income of \nabout  CNY3,000  for  a  family  or  CNY700  for  each  person  every  year.  This  additional  income \nwould help a poor household gradually move out of poverty. \n \n59. \nThe gender assessment conducted as part of the social and poverty analysis found that \nthe Project can contribute to increasing the social, educational, and health status of women. The \nProject  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse  effects  on  women.  Given  the  history  of  such \nprojects  in  the  PRC,  women  have  always  been  an  integral  part  of  project  planning, \n\n                                                 \n22  Using  a  $2  a  day  poverty  line  (at  2005  purchasing  power  parity),  the  rural  poverty  incidence  rate  was  25.2%  in \n2007  for  the  14  project  beneficiary  counties,  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  59.8%  for  Yuexi,  56.8%  for  Qianshan, \n34.7% for Lingbi, and 34.0% for Sixian. \n\n23 It  will  benefit  2.8  million  people  in  three  counties  (Linbi,  Sixian,  and  Wuhe),  two  of  which  (Linbi  and  Sixian)  are \n\nofficially designated poverty counties, and one city (Mingguang). \n\n \n\n\fimplementation,  and  postconstruction  activities.  The  road  safety  component  of  the  Project  will \nlargely  benefit  women  because  women,  children,  and  the  elderly  are  the  main  pedestrians. \nMoreover, the village bus services component will allow easy access to township centers, which \nenable women to access townships in less time, more cost effectively, and with greater safety. \nThe  Project  will  provide  necessary  provisions \nfor  empowering  women  during  project \nimplementation,  and  anticipates  continued  participation  of  women  during  planning, \nimplementation,  and  postconstruction  activities  with  assistance  from  the  All-China  Women's \nFederation. ADB's Policy on Gender Development (1998) will be followed. \n \nThe social development action plan (SDAP) was formulated based on discussions with \n60. \nAPDOT  and  other  relevant  agencies  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  SDAP  is  designed  to \nensure the mitigation of potential social risks and enhancement of social benefits in an inclusive \nmanner, especially for the poor, women, and other vulnerable groups. The SDAP specifies key \nactions,  target  groups, implementing  agencies,  funding source,  and  monitoring  indicators.  Key \nfeatures of the SDAP include (i) road safety, including community involvement; (ii) income and \nlivelihood  recovery  for  resettlement  of  affected  people;  (iii)  transmissible  disease  prevention; \n(iv) avoidance  of  community  disturbance  during  project  construction;  (v) enhancement  of  local \neconomic  benefits  from  project  construction;  (vi)  complementary  poverty  reduction  programs; \n(vii)  gender  and  development  measures  for  women;  and  (viii) transport  service  improvements. \nThe  SDAP  will  be  reviewed  again  during  the  loan  inception  mission,  and  some  modifications \ncould  be  made  if  necessary.  ACIG,  AHAB,  and  ATAB  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating \nactions  with  other  relevant  agencies,  as  specified,  and  will  collect  monitoring  data,  including \ngender-disaggregated data, as specified in the SDAP. \n \nThe  Project  will  pilot  test  the  Resource  Manual  for  Health  and  Safety  in  Infrastructure \n61. \ndeveloped  under  the  ADB  TA  for  Preventing  HIV/AIDS  on  Road  Projects  in  Yunnan  Province \n(footnote  12).  Separate  measures  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases  are \nincluded  in  the  project  design.  Health,  awareness,  screening,  and  treatment  requirements  are \nstipulated  in  the  ADB  standard  contract  bidding  document  and  compliance  will  be  monitored \nregularly. \n \n62. \nPublic consultation for the Project was undertaken in three phases: initial consultations \nat  project  initiation,  a  first  formal  round  of  public  consultation  of  environmental  impact \nassessments (EIAs) and resettlement plans, and a second round of public consultation to gather \nopinions on environment and resettlement measures. More than 12,000 people participated in \nthe  consultation  activities.  The  stakeholders'  consultation  and  participation  are  documented  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \n \n \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  APCD  prepared  resettlement \n63. \nplans  for  the  XME  and  for  three  of  the  nine  local  roads  that  have  resettlement  impacts. \nResettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages  in  June  2009.  This \nProject  requires  acquisition  of  952  hectares  of  land.  The  Project  will  cause  some  land  loss  in \n129  villages,  which  partially  affects  an  estimated  17,000  households.  Also,  about \n1,170 households  will  need  to  be  relocated;  the  number  was  reduced  by  optimizing  the  XME \nalignment  and  constructing  bypasses  around  towns  for  the  upgraded  local  roads.  For  land \ncompensation,  the  same  standards  have  been  adopted  for  the  XME  and  the  local  roads.  The \nfour  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  based  on  detailed  design  and  detailed  measurement \nsurveys, and then submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to commencement of civil works. No \nethnic minorities in the project area are affected. The summary resettlement plan is included in \nAppendix 15. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n3. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n64. \nThis  is  an  environmental  category  A  project.  APDOT  prepared  an  EIA  report  for  the \nproject expressway; Anhui Environmental Protection Department approved the report on 28 July \n2009. APDOT also prepared four EIA reports for nine local project roads; Anhui Environmental \nProtection  Department  approved  these  on  22 June  2009.  An  initial  environmental  examination \nwas  prepared  for  the  three  bus  stations.  A  summary  EIA,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) for the Project, was discussed and endorsed by APDOT, circulated to \nthe  ADB  Board  of  Directors,  and  made  public  through  the  ADB  website  on  4  July  2009.  The \nEIAs,  the  initial  environmental  examination,  and  the  summary  EIA  assess  the  environmental \nimpact  of  the  selected  alignments  of  the  expressway,  local  roads,  and  bus  stations;  and \nprescribe environmental protection and mitigation measures costing CNY109 million. To ensure \nthat  all  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  mitigated,  APDOT  will \nimplement  the  EMPs  as  specified  in  the  EIAs  and  the  summary  EIA.  The  EMPs  will  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for civil works; they will be monitored and \nsemiannual reports submitted to ADB. \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\n65. \nOverall,  the  project  risk  is  rated  low.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical \nrisks. The project design considered potential financial and social risks. All local roads under the \nProject will be toll free. A financial analysis was conducted of provincial revenue, including the \navailability of sufficient counterpart funds, future maintenance and operating expenses, as well \nas  loan  repayments.  This  revealed  that  the  fiscal  impact  and  financial  risks  of  the  Project  are \nlow.  Social  issues  include  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  road  safety,  and  prevention  of \ntransmissible diseases. Appropriate mitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plans, \nroad and traffic management designs, and disease prevention awareness program. \n \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delays  in  timely  approvals  of  the  recommended  regulatory \n66. \nchanges  of  the  village  bus  licensing  system  are  addressed  by  establishing  a  project \ndevelopment  group  in  each  county  to  act  as  an  implementing  unit.  The  project  development \ngroup  will  have  authority  to  recommend  implementation  of  regulatory  changes.  Consulting \nservices will be provided during implementation to develop and agree on necessary procedures \nand documentation. Training programs will be designed for bus operators and regulators to train \nthem in the new procedures. ADB will continue dialogue with APG and the Ministry of Transport. \nAny problems will be identified, and adjustments made where necessary to ensure that the new \nsystem works effectively. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  APG  have  given  the \n\n67. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n68. \nAsset  Management. APG will provide adequate resources to ensure the project roads \nare  maintained  and  operated  in  good  condition,  and  that  the  benefits  of  the  roads  will  be \nrealized over their expected lifetimes.  \n \n69. \nCoordination Arrangement. The Government will ensure that (i) prior to the opening of \nthe project expressway, the Jiangsu government will construct the section of the expressway in \nJiangsu  province  (about  4  km)  linking  the  project  expressway  to  the  Xuzhou\u2013Huai'an \n\n \n\n\fexpressway in Jiangsu, to maximize the benefits of the project expressway; and (ii) such section \nis constructed to at least the same technical standards as those of the project expressway. \n \n70. \nSustainability  and  Resource  Efficiency.  APG  will  ensure  that  resource  efficiency \nprocedures  are  used  in  project  design  and  construction  including  (i) local  procurement  and \nmanufacturing of materials, (ii) use of existing materials including existing paving and road base \nmaterials, and (iii) development of a waste management plan to be included in the EMP. APG \nwill appoint an independent environment, health, and safety supervisory team within 3 months \nfrom  loan  effectiveness  consisting  of  consultants  having  qualifications  and  experience  in \nengineering, environment, health, and safety. \n \n71. \nRoad  Safety. APG will (i) ensure that design guidelines on road safety provided during \nproject preparation are incorporated in the bidding documents; (ii) ensure that road safety audits \nare  carried  out  and  recommendations  of  these  audits  are  taken  into  account  during  project \ndetailed  design,  prior  to  opening  and  after  opening  of  the  roads  to  traffic  (monitoring  and \nevaluation);  (iii)  promulgate  the  Highway  Safety  Guidelines  of  Anhui  Province  within  2  years \nafter  loan  effectiveness;  and  (iv)  implement  a  road  safety  awareness  program  in  roadside \ncommunities  and  encourage  community  participation  and  feedback  in  road  and  traffic  safety \ndesign and operation.  \n \nVillage  Bus  Licensing  Reforms.  APG  will  ensure  that  (i)  village  bus  regulatory  and \n72. \nlicensing  reforms  are  implemented  in  the  three  project  townships  to  improve  road  transport \nefficiency;  (ii)  while  proposing  the  maximum  limit  of  permissible  fares,  the  pricing  bureaus  will \nconsider the costs of providing the service, including the costs of maintaining and replacing the \nvehicles plus an appropriate return on the capital invested in the vehicle; (iii) give discretion to \nthe  bus  operator  companies  to  vary  the  fares  below  the  maximum  limit;  (iv)  the  traffic  police \nenforce  all  traffic  regulations  in  the  project  townships,  in  particular  strict  restraint  on  running \nunlicensed vehicles;  and  (v)  promulgate  the  Guidelines  for Village  Bus Services  Best  Practice \nwithin 2 years after loan effectiveness. \n \n73. \nFinancial  Ratios.  APG  will  ensure  that  ACIG  maintains  (i)  a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  not \nmore than 65:35 for the project expressway; (ii) a working ratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding \nperiodic maintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 15% from the first year of full operation \nof the project expressway; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 from the \nthird year of the project expressway's full operation. \n \nTolling  Plan.  APDOT  will  prepare,  with  ADB's  concurrence,  at  least  6  months  prior  to \n74. \nthe opening of the project expressway, a tolling plan and submit it for the approval of APG.

In 2007, the province had 5,600 kilometers (km) \nof navigable waterways, 2,400 km of railways, and 148,000 km of highways. Transport flows in \nAnhui  have  grown  at  about  8.5%  per  annum  since  2003  (8.4%  for  freight  and  8.8%  for \npassengers),  a  lower  rate  than  the  national  average  (13.5%  for  freight  and  9.4%  for \npassengers). At national level, road and inland waterway modes have been dynamic, with rates \nof  growth  at  or  above  10%,  while  railways  lagged,  on  average  below  5%  per  annum.  Overall, \nthe transport matrix in Anhui remains healthily balanced, with a relatively more important role of \nthe  road  network  than  nationally.  Roads  carry  64%  of  passengers,  while  railways  and  inland \nwaterways  are  the  preferred  modes  for  freight  transport,  especially  for  bulk  goods.  Road \ntransport plays an essential role in the collection and distribution system, which carried 75% of \ntons in 2007. Figure A2 presents the trends in the production of transport modes in the province. \n \n\nFigure A2: Transport Demand Trends in Anhui \n\nFreight Transport in Anhui (t.km)\n\nPassenger Transport in Anhui (p.km)\n\ne\nr\na\nh\ns\n\n \nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nM\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\nm\nk\n\n.\nt\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n0\n0\n1\n\ne\nr\na\nh\ns\n \nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nM\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n1,000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nm\nk\n.\n\np\n\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n \n0\n0\n1\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nRailways\n\nWaterways\n\nHighways\n\nRailways share\n\nWaterways share\n\nHighways share\n\nRailways\n\nHighways\n\nRailways share\n\nHighways share\n\nSource: Anhui statistical yearbooks, 2003\u20132007. \n\n \n2. \nAnhui's road network is relatively dense but provides poor service to the population. The \ntotal  length of  highways  per  habitant  brings  the  province  in  line  with  the  national  average  and \nabove its western neighbors. However, road quality in Anhui is relatively limited: (i)12,500 km of \nmain highways (class II or above), placing it in the bottom third of the distribution of provinces; \n(ii) 362 km of arterial class I roads; and (iii) 22% of the network with dual-lane asphalt or cement \nconcrete  surfacing.  The  network  also  presents  an  unbalanced  geographic  distribution \n(Table A2.1).  For  Anhui  to  meet  its  connectivity  and  capacity  needs  in  the  medium  term,  the \nGovernment  estimates  that  the  province  will  need  to  double  the  length  of  its  trunk  network \n(5,200 km of class I highways or expressways from 2,500 km in 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nItem \nExpressway \nClass I \nClass II \nClass III \nClass IV \n\nTable A2.1: Composition of Anhui Road Network, 2007  \n(km) \nCounty\n\nSpecial\n\nNational  Provincial\n1,395\n148 \n5929\n696 \n298\n8,473\n\n811 \n199 \n1,951 \n143 \n137 \n3,241 \n\n0\n15 \n1,875\n12,249 \n9,630\n23,876\n\nTownship\n0\n0 \n49\n414 \n31,586\n36,224\n\n0\n0 \n13\n85 \n716\n1004\n\nVillage \n0 \n0 \n7 \n261 \n59,634 \n75,554 \n\nTotal\n2,206\n362 \n9,824\n13,848 \n102,001\n148,372\n\nManagement and Financing of Roads \n\nTotal \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport Yearbook (2007). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nAnhui Provincial Department of Transport (APDOT) oversees the road subsector; it has \ndirect  authority  over  two  agencies:  Anhui  Highway  Administration  Bureau  (AHAB)  and  Anhui \nTransport  Administration  Bureau;  it  also  supervises  two  public  expressway  companies,  Anhui \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited and Anhui Expressway Company Limited. \nAs in other provinces in the PRC, APDOT has been mostly relying until 2008 on self-financing \n(user  fees  and  tolls),  bank  and  international  financial  institution  loan  financing,  as  well  as \nMinistry  of  Transport  (MOT)  grants  and  subgovernment  contributions  rather  than  on  provincial \nbudgets.  APDOT's  revenues  and  expenditures  grew  at  12%  per  year  from  2003  to  2008,  but \nincurred a 25% drop in 2008, as impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis initially constrained \nMOT and provincial government expenditures (Table A2.2). \n \n\nTable A2.2: APDOT Highway Revenue and Expenditure  \n(CNY million) \n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2007 \n\n2008\n\nItem \nA.

According to its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010),1 the province will develop integrated \ntransport  hubs  in  six  major  cities;  link  all  provincial  cities  by  railway,  and  county  towns  by \nexpressways; and provide paved access to all villages. Over those 5 years, total investment in \ntransport  infrastructure  is  expected  to  reach  CNY213.5  billion:  CNY70.0  billion  for  railways, \nCNY125.0 billion for highways, CNY8.5 billion for inland waterways, CNY5.0 billion for airports \nand  CNY5.0  billion  for  pipelines.  Expressway  network  length  would  reach  3,500  km,  while \nclass I and II highways would reach 12,500 km. The Government accelerated its infrastructure \ninvestment  pace  in  2008.  During  the  second  half  year  of  2008,  as  part  of  the  PRC  growth \nstimulus program, APDOT anticipated the construction of six expressways and one bridge that \nwere shovel-ready. The Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway (which the Project would finance) is a \nkey component of the program for 2009 and 2010.  \n \nIn  parallel  to  expressway  development,  APDOT  formulated  a  3-year  \u201c515\u201d  program  for \n5. \nnational  and  provincial  trunk  highways.  Under  this  plan,  AHAB  would  invest  CNY10  billion  to \ndevelop 500 km of class I highways, 10,000 km of class II highways, and undertake 5,000 km of \nrehabilitation  works.  The  identification  and  prioritization  of  the  investments  was  undertaken  by \nthe APG on the basis of the prioritized criteria described in Box A2. The Project would finance \nnine  investments  (Appendix  5)  considered  as  priority  for  2010,  and  for  which  the  Government \nidentified  a  financing  gap.  The  APG  and  ADB  selected  the  investments  with  the  objectives  to \n(i) obtain  a  demonstration  effect  of  improved  practices  in  the  areas  of  construction  techniques \nand  safety  enhancement,  for  different  classes  of  roads  and  civil  works;  and  (ii)  increase  the \nimpact  of  other  components  of  the  Project  (e.g.,  feeder  roads  for  the  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang \nExpressway and rural roads in the area of impact of the village bus demonstration project). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC. \n \nResource  Optimization.  The  PRC  is  one  of  the  most  advanced  countries  when  it \n6. \nrelates  to  optimizing  the  use  of  energy  and  land,  and  mitigating  the  environmental \nconsequences  of  transport.  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  supported  the  preparation  of  a \nhandbook  and  guidelines  on  how  to  apply  those  concepts  to  roads.2  This  notably  entails \nreducing  the  length  of  the  transport  routes  through  better  network  connectivity  and  logistics \noptimization, adjusting road capacity to demand to limit land take, and factoring in the price of \n\n \n1.

The PRC Government initiated the fuel tax reform on 1 January 2009. \nSix transport user charges collected by provincial and local administrations were abolished. The \ntolls  on  class  II  roads  were  removed  in  12  pilot  provinces  by  May  2009,  including  Anhui.  To \ncompensate, the Government introduced a new fuel tax of CNY0.8\u2013CNY1.0 per liter, collected \nby  the  central  administration.  The  fuel  tax  reform  has  several  aims:  (i) improve  the  economic \nefficiency of the fee structure, now closer to a pay-as-you-go mechanism, (ii) remove inefficient \ntolling  practices,  as  tolls  on  class  II  roads  often  barely  covered  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts, and (iii) improve financial accountability of the sector. In 2009, AHAB expects to receive \nCNY2.4 billion  from  the  central  Government,  through  the  province's  finance  bureau.  AHAB \nplans  to  prioritize  staff  and  maintenance  expenses,  while  dedicating  about  CNY400  million  to \nupgrading  roads.  AHAB  will  soon  face  important  issues  regarding  the  financing  of  its  class  I \nroad development program and repayment of debts accumulated for the construction of class II \nroads.3  The  reduction  of  maintenance  and  investment  budgets  appears  to  be  a  key  medium-\nterm risk. \n \n8. \nManagement of Maintenance of Local Roads. Routine and periodic maintenance has \nhistorically  been  undertaken  by  AHAB's  local  in-house  units.  With  11,300  staff  and  a  share  of \nnonmanagerial  staff  double  that  in  other  provinces  in  the  PRC,  AHAB  appears  currently \noverstaffed,  a  factor  that  limits  budgets  available  for  maintenance  works.  With  World  Bank \nsupport,4  AHAB  has  been  strengthening  its  maintenance  management.  AHAB  is  currently \ndeploying a road asset management system. It pilots the contracting out of periodic and routine \nmaintenance  through  a  combined  2-year  contract  covering  a  total  of  120 km.  Adjusting  to  this \nnew \ninstitutional  changes,  such  as  creating  a  performance \nmanagement  regime,  clarifying  the  division\u2019s  responsibilities  for  maintenance,  emergency \nworks,  and  winter  operation  of  the  road;  as  well  as  fostering  the  emergence  of  multipurpose \nprivate  contractors.  AHAB  has  limited  capacity  to  reduce  its  staff  and  will  thus  face  difficulties \nscaling-up the pilot on its network. \n \n9. \nRoad Safety. Road safety continues to be a major issue in the PRC. The road accident-\nrelated  fatalities  exceeded  100,000  annually  in  the  early  2000s.  In  2004,  the  Ministry  of \nTransport launched a highway safety enhancement program to address this situation, involving \nimproved road design, safety audits, removal of black spots, improved road signage, and speed \ncontrol. By 2008, the total number of fatalities was reduced to 73,500. However, with the rapid \nincrease  in  the  number  of  vehicles  and  improvements  in  the  quality  of  roads,  road  safety \nremains  a  serious  problem.  Table  A2.3  summarizes  the  accident  situation  in  Anhui.  In  2008, \n8,413  accidents  were  reported,  resulting  in  3,000  fatalities  and  more  than  10,000 casualties. \nExpressways account for 20% of the traffic volume, but only 10% of accidents. Comparatively, \nclass I, II, and III highways appear to be 3\u20135 times more dangerous. \n \n\nframework  would  require \n\n                                                 \n3   In 2009, the outstanding balance of those loans in Anhui is CNY16.0 billion at the provincial level, CNY12.0 billion \n\nat the municipal level, and CNY0.6 billion at lower levels. \n\n4   World Bank. 2008.

Many public transport services in rural areas in the PRC are provided \n10. \nby  unlicensed  operators,  often  using  vehicles  that  are  unsuitable  for  the  purpose,  are  not \nproperly  maintained,  and  are  not  always  driven  safely.  Most  rural  transport  operators  tend  to \npurchase  vehicles  with  the  lowest  initial  cost,  even  though  their  whole-life  cycle  costs  may  be \nmuch higher than alternative vehicle types. Anhui Province is characterized by a predominance \nof three-wheelers or seven-seat minibuses; larger vehicles would be more cost-effective. ADB \nTA  outlined  how  the  development  of  more  flexible  regulatory  frameworks  adapted  to  village \ntransportation  could  allow  a  regularization  of  unlicensed  operators  and  foster  better  access, \naffordability, and safety of rural public transport.5 \n \n11. \nOverloading.  The  important  production  and  demand  for  raw  materials  and  primary \nproducts in Anhui generates incentives for truck overloading. Overloading is cited as the major \ncause  for  the  deterioration  of  the  pavement  on  lower  classes  of  Anhui's  road  network,  which \nwere built according to light technical standards. In 2004, the APG formulated a comprehensive \noverloading  management  program,  combining  enforcement,  weight-based \ntolling,  and \ninformation systems upgrade. Efforts reduced the truck overloading rate from more than 80% to \na current 10% on the provincial network. However, important geographic disparities remain and \nthe situation on lower networks is poor. \n \n12. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company \nLimited used private financing to develop its trunk road network. Between 1993 and 2004, the \nprivate  sector  was  involved  in  23  projects  involving  bridges,  highways,  and  expressways \nthrough  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  or  build\u2013and\u2013transfer  concession.  However,  many  projects \nincurred financial difficulties after 2004, when the banks tightened their credit, and the provincial \ngovernment had to buy back several projects. Some private contractors have focused on short-\nterm  rather  than  long-term  profitability,  as  they  have  had  little  security  over  their  investments: \n(i) contracts are incomplete and weakly enforced, and (ii) provincial toll rates are determined by \nthe Price Bureau on a 5-year basis, independent of the contracts.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2006.

The  European \n\n \n1. \nIn  the  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  (WB)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road \nnetworks. The WB has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the \nJICA (provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has provided about \u00a5195.0 billion \nfor \nInvestment  Bank  (EIB)  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) provided cofinancing in the amount of Euro 85 million for road projects in \nthe  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  ADB  coordinates  with  these  development  partners  to \ndiscuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has met regularly with the WB for coordination \nand  information  sharing.  The  Government  coordinates  the  activities  of  different  development \npartners  and  has  utilized  ADB  TA  support  for  researching  and  influencing  a  number  of  policy \ninterventions. ADB has coordinated closely with other development partners on policy dialogue \nand shared its development experiences with them. \n \n\nTable A3: Major Development Partners: Key Activities \nDate Approved \n\nTotal \n\nProject Name \nA.

Projects \nfinanced by ADB in the PRC \ncountry strategy and program focus \non poorer central and western \nregions. \n\nThe Government launched in \nNovember 2008 a CNY4 trillion \nfiscal stimulus package including \nimportant infrastructure projects.  \n\nADB agreed to meet with the \nGovernment\u2019s requests to bring \nforward project processing. \n\nThe Government is investing for \nthe development of a balanced \ntransport matrix in the PRC and \nAnhui.  \n\nUnder the Resource Optimization \nin the Road Sector TA, ADB has \nprovided assistance to MOT to \nimprove sustainability of transport \ninvestments. \n\nUnder its 11th five-year plan, the \nAnhui Provincial People\u2019s \nGovernment targets to develop \nintegrated transport hubs in major \ncities by railway, highways, and \ninland waterways (if possible); and \nprovide paved access to all \nvillages. Under the Sustainable \nRural Transport Services TA, ADB \nproposed rural transport services \nreform, agreed to by the Ministry of \nTransport. \n\nActions Taken Under the Project\nMajor components of the Project are \nlocated in poverty counties. To enhance \ndevelopment impact, the project scope \nincludes (i) the development of a local \nroad network to disseminate benefits of \nthe expressway, and (ii) components on \nrural transport services for poor areas. \n\nThe Project will have important \nemployment impacts and support the \nconsolidation of industrial and \nagricultural growth centers in the central \nareas of the PRC. The Project was \ninitially programmed for 2010 and \naccelerated by 1 year. \n\nThe expressway project will reduce fuel \nconsumption by cutting travel distance \non a major transport corridor. Project \ndesign has been optimized to preserve \nenvironment and minimize land take. \n\nThe Project will support balanced \ndevelopment of all classes of road \nnetworks in the province and increased \nrural mobility by implementing, on a \npilot basis, village bus route licensing \nreform and providing basic service \ninfrastructure (bus stations, shelters, \nand stop signs). \n\n \n\nOutcomes/Status\nThe 11th five-year program of \nAnhui Provincial Department \nof Transport (APDOT) \nemphasizes the provision of \nquality access to counties, \ntowns and villages. \n\nProject preparation was \nsuccessfully accelerated while \nmaintaining high quality. \n\nOriginal expressway design \noptimization led to the \npreservation of a major \nnatural reserve and to a \nreduction of project cost by \n30%. The existing pavement \nand road base material will be \nrecycled for the local road \nnetwork. \n\nTo develop a balanced road \nnetwork specified in the \nprovince road sector \ndevelopment plan.  \n\nRural village bus service \nreform will be demonstrated \nthrough three pilot projects in \nthree townships. \n\n5.  Road \n\nmaintenance \n\nTo sustain the asset value, \nneed to rebalance the need \nfor new construction and \nmaintenance. \n\nAPDOT is piloting the contracting-\nout of maintenance, and \nimplements a road asset \nmanagement system (RAMS). \n\nThe Project will support efforts to use \nthe RAMS for maintenance planning \nand budgeting. \n\nRAMS data gathering \ncompleted for the whole \nprovince in May 2009. \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n \n\n3\n1\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \nInitiative \n6.

Tolling practices on \nlow-volume roads have \nreduced affordability of \ntransport for the poorest. \n\nPoor road safety design, \nlack of sufficient attention \nto safety, poor public \ntransport vehicles, and \ninadequate traffic \nenforcement and driver \ntraining contribute to poor \nsafety record. \n\n \n\n \n\nActions Taken by ADB and the\nGovernment\nOn 1 January 2009, the \nGovernment launched fuel tax \nreform, which led to the removal of \ntolls on class II and below \nhighways.  \n\nReform of rural transport services \nis expected to improve productivity \nand competitiveness of local public \ntransport services. \n\nAssistance is being provided to \nimprove safety and efficiency of \nroad transport operations and \nstrengthen traffic law enforcement \nunder the Road Safety \nImprovement TA. \n\nIn 2004, the Government \nintroduced the National Road \nSafety Law.  \n\nActions Taken Under the Project\n\nToll policy on project roads was \nreviewed to ensure affordability.  \n\nReform of pilot rural village bus services \nshould lead to better and more \naffordable services in the project area. \n\nOutcomes/Status\nProject local road network will \nnot be tolled, and toll rates \nestimated on the project \nexpressway were deemed \naffordable. \n\n3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nThe Project will address safety issues \nby (i) implementing comprehensive \nsafety enhancement on nine highways \nfor a total of 452 km, (ii) conducting \nsafety audits and other measures, \n(iii) preparing highway safety guidelines \nfor Anhui Province, (iv) establishing an \ninteragency road safety working group, \nand (v) developing a road safety \nprogram for APDOT. \n\nRoad accidents in the PRC in \n2008 showed improvement \nover 2000, with \n73,500 casualties instead of \nabout 100,000 at the \nbeginning of the decade. The \nAnhui fatality rate per \n10,000 habitants is 20% lower \nthan the PRC average. \n\n8.   Sustainable \nsector \nfinancing \nframework \n\nThe recent fuel tax reform \nhas a major impact on the \nlong-term sector \nsustainable financing \nframework. \n\nThe Government is channeling \nnational fuel tax revenues to \nprovincial governments. ADB is \npreparing a small-scale TA to the \ncentral Government on the fuel tax \nreform issue.  \n\nThe Project will undertake a study to \nassess the financial impacts of fuel tax \nreform on the sector, and develop a \nlong-term financing framework for \nmaintenance, network development, \nand debt repayment. \n\n \n\nThe Government will take \nover a share of the debt \nservices of the province\u2019s \nlocal roads.  \n\n9.  Private sector \n\nparticipation \n\nThe road subsector needs \nto continuously attract more \nprivate sector participation. \n\nPrivate sector participation \naccounts for about 10% of total \ninvestment in roads since the \n1990s.  \n\nSix months before project completion, \nAPDOT will assess the possibility of \nundertaking a maintenance and \noperation concession. \n\nThe private sector has \nparticipated in 23 highway, \nexpressway, and bridge \nprojects since 1993 in the \nprovince. \n\nADB supports private sector \nparticipation in its projects and has \nprovided assistance through TA \nand lending programs.  \n\nACIG will explore the possibility of \nattracting private financing through \nlisting the company, concessions, \nleasing or securitizing toll revenues \nwhen market conditions will allow. \n\n10.  Overloading \n\nOverloading of trucks has \nadverse impacts on \npavement condition, traffic \nflow, vehicle emissions, \nand safety. \n\nAn interministerial committee was \nestablished to develop and \nimplement special measures to \nenforce regulations on overloaded \ntrucks nationwide. \n\nTo control overloading, Anhui will \nimplement weight-based tolling on the \nexpressways, install weight-based \ncontrol stations on provincial local road \nnetworks within the provincial \nframework. The province will reinforce \nits education and enforcement program. \n\nVehicle overloading has been \nreduced from 80% to 20% in \nAnhui. Overloading will be \ngradually improved with \nspecial measures \nimplemented nationwide. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APDOT  =  Anhui  Provincial  Department  of  Transport,  ACIG  =  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company  Limited,        \nRAMS = road asset management system, MOT = Ministry of Transport, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION \n\nComponent A: Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway  \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  Expressway  (XME),  (ii)  local \nroads and safety improvement, (iii) rural village bus services, and (iv) institutional development \nand capacity building. \n \nA. \n \nThe XME is located in the northeast of Anhui Province, close to the border with Jiangsu \n2. \nProvince. The XME will be a section of about 139 kilometers (km) of an expressway linking the \nXuzhou  area  in  Jiangsu  to  Mingguang  in  Anhui.  At  the  Xuzhou  (northern)  end,  it  starts  at  an \ninterchange  on  the  Xuzhou\u2013Huai\u2019an  Expressway  in  Jiangsu  Province  and  ends  at  an \ninterchange on the Bengbu\u2013Nanjing Expressway in the south. The XME is a priority project of \nthe  provincial  11th  five-year  plan.  It  forms  part  of  the  planned  network  included  in  the  Central \nRegion  Development  Plan,  which  proposes  a  growth  strategy  for  the  six  central  region \nprovinces\u2014Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi. \n \n3. \nThe alignment was chosen to minimize impacts on populations and environment, while \nserving  future  urban  development  centers  and  being  cost-effective.  While  the  most  direct \nalignment considered would have crossed the Touhu Lake Nature Reserve, after a multi-criteria \nanalysis  of  three  alternatives,  an  alignment  that  completely  avoids  the  natural  reserve  was \nchosen. The XME was originally proposed as a six-lane carriageway. After review of the traffic \nforecasts, it will now be the four-lane expressway standard with a design speed of 120 km per \nhour, and an overall formation width of 27 meters. The overall cost, including civil works, land \nacquisition, and environmental measures, but excluding contingencies, is $844.8 million, or an \naverage of $6.9 million per km. \n \n4. \nThe  starting  point  of  XME  is  the  provincial  border  with  Jiangsu;  construction  of  an \nadditional 4 km of route is required to connect with the Xuzhou\u2013Huai\u2019an Expressway. The cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis assumes prorated costs and benefits for the additional 4 km. Brief assessments \nof  the  potential  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  section  within  Jiangsu  were \nundertaken as it is clearly a \"linked\" project. Jiangsu Provincial Communications Department will \nfinance  and  complete  the  4  km  link  by  2014  under  the  existing  interprovincial  arrangements \nreached in early 2009. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAnhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) is undertaking a progressive upgrade of \nthe  local  road  network  to  support  the  overall  development  objectives  of  Anhui  Province.  This \nprogram has three objectives: (i) ensure that the condition and capacity of infrastructure meets \ncurrent and future demand needs; (ii) provide quality access to the trunk network to all sectors \nof society by developing a balanced hierarchy of roads linking all major centers, counties, and \ntownships;  and  (iii)  progressively  bring  the  highway  infrastructure  to  modern  safety  standards. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  three  objectives  by  financing  improvements  including  road \nupgrading,  rehabilitation,  and  safety  enhancement  to  nine  trunk  and  feeder  sections  of  the \nnetwork. Three of the sections are in relatively poor agricultural districts in the northeast of the \nprovince  and  will  provide  access  to  the  XME;  four  are  in  the  poor  mountainous  areas  in  the \nsouthwest  of  the  province;  the  remaining  two  will  stimulate  and  serve  economic  and  industrial \ndevelopment in key corridors.

It has both regional and local significance. \n \nThe Project provides benefits from enhanced mobility and access, and will \nimprove the environment of the area. \n \nWith such improvements, living conditions in the project area will be \nimproved, which will help lead to other improvements to infrastructure and \nservices such as medical care, education, and sanitary conditions in the \narea. \n \nThe transport matrix in Anhui is well balanced. The modal share of roads in \nton-km is only 27% for freight as the rail and the inland waterway \nnavigation (IWT) modes dominate long-distance transport. The road mode \nplays an essential role for collection and distribution, notably in corridors \nwhere rail links or IWT is not economical or feasible. \n \nUnder its 11th plan, Anhui Province will progress to the completion of high-\nquality integrated transport infrastructure, where each mode of transport is \ndedicated to its area of natural competitive advantage. Forty percent of \nAnhui's 11th plan transport investments are for the rail, IWT, and pipeline \nlinks. \n \nAnhui is a landlocked province with no other alternate viable transport \noption in the project area. Road transportation is essential between rural \nfarming areas and markets. \n \nAt present, Anhui is one of the least-developed provinces in the PRC and \npoverty and urban\u2013rural disparity is a major issue. Without improvements \nto the transport system, economic development will be slowed.

It will facilitate local urbanization, allow \nindustry to be economically more viable along project roads, add value to \nagricultural industries through better market access, promote tourism \ndevelopment, and improve access to local social services like education \nand medical care. \n \nThe project EIAs are completed for the improvement works and conclude \nthat adverse environmental impacts associated with the Project can be \nprevented, eliminated, or minimized to an acceptable level. \n \nEnvironmental benefits will be provided to areas that are presently \nsubjected to unacceptable transport noise by the provision of new noise \nbarriers and insulation. Air pollution will be reduced through a more direct \ntransport route and better traffic flow conditions. \n \nResources will be used to construct the Project. Measures have been \nproposed to reduce the use of new materials through recycling of existing \npavement and road base. Resources will be obtained locally. \n \nThe Project will follow the national strategy for reducing air pollution \nthrough (i) enforcing stricter emission standards; (ii) enforcing the \ninspection and maintenance program; (iii) encouraging use of alternative or \ncleaner fuels by modifying existing vehicles to dual fuel engine vehicles, \nand establishing cleaner filling stations such as compressed natural gas \nstations; and (iv) forcing retirement of older vehicles. \n \nThese measures are based on long-term improvements and target \ntimelines for implementation are described in Appendix 7. \n \nOther environmental aspects (such as noise, land acquisition) are \npredicted to be within the national and local criteria with the application of \neffective mitigation measures. \n \nBased on transport demand studies undertaken for the Project, the Project \nhas been reduced in scale to expected future demand requirements to \nachieve the present and future needs of the area. \n \nTransport planning was considered in the scale and location of the Project \nand various alternative alignments were examined in the prefeasibility \nstudies and considered (i) protection of natural reserve, (ii) minimized need \nfor resettlement, (iii) conservation of productive agricultural lands, (iv) \nminimized environmental damage, (v) technical feasibility, (vi) geological \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n3\n9\n\n\f4\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\n \n \nNo. \n\nGuidelines for \nEnvironmentally \nSustainable Transport \n\n \nConsiderations for Development of \nTransport Schemes \n\n \nAnhui Integrated Transport Sector \nImprovement Project \n\nIdentify social and \neconomic implications of \nthe vision, and ensure they \nare consistent with social \nand economic \nsustainability. \n \n\nHave the economic and social implications of \nthe Project been considered against the \nwithout-project scenario? \n \nHave external costs, such as those related to \naccidents, pollution, and climate change been \nconsidered? \n\nAre benefits achieved from the Project with \nregard to such issues as time savings and \ncongestion relief? \n\nDoes the scheme consider the needs across a \nwide range of society rather than just one \nsector (for example, does it benefit \ncommunities as well as industry)? \n \nHave measures been reviewed to assist in \nachieving more environmentally sustainable \ntransport, such as:  \n\uf0b7  Pricing strategies \n\uf0b7 \nTechnology policies \n\uf0b7 \nInfrastructure investment \n\uf0b7 \nTraffic management \nImprovements to public transport \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Encouraging alternative transport \n\uf0b7 \n \nWill the Project be implemented effectively?   \n\nImproving road safety? \n\nHow will performance be assessed? \n\nConstruct packages of \nmeasures and instruments \nfor reaching \nenvironmentally \nsustainable transport. \n\nDevelop an implementation \nstrategy taking into account \nlocal, regional, and national \ncircumstances with \ntimetable and \nresponsibilities. \n\n \n\nrisks, (vii) construction costs, and (viii) present and future transport \nrequirements. \n \nThe economic and social implications were reviewed against the \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d scenario. \n\nExternal costs were considered, in particular for safety. The Project will \nimprove the existing roads through good road design. Accidents and \nincidents to life and injury can be reduced. Measures have also been \nsuggested for speed control, signage, rumble strips, dividing islands, \nprotected crossings for pedestrians, bus stops and shelters, and parking \nareas. These measures will be accompanied by a targeted program of \nselective enforcement and publicity. \n \nMeasures are being taken in terms of national policy to address CO2 \nemissions, which are strongly correlated to fuel consumption. Fuel savings \nwere reviewed in the feasibility study report and CO2 emissions are \nexpected to be reduced by the Project through a more direct transport \nroute and through various improvement measures. \n \nThe Project will have a wide spectrum of beneficiaries on a regional and \nlocal scale, rather than just one sector. \n\nThe Project will support the construction of township bus stations and bus \nlicensing reforms to allow operators more flexibility in customizing their \nroutes to meet passenger needs in rural areas. \n\nTraffic on the Project will be tolled and as such will cover its capital and \nmaintenance costs. In addition, users will pay a fuel tax. \n\nA series of measures are recommended for improving road safety. The \nlocal roads improvements will improve the safety of pedestrian and cycling \ntransport, which will raise attractiveness of nonmotorized transport. \n \n\nPerformance should be assessed through a design and monitoring \nframework; clear performance targets are set out. Environmental \nperformance will be audited during the construction stage by an \nindependent environmental, health, and safety team that will report on the \nProject to the Executing Agency and ADB. \n\n \n\n6. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nNo. \n9. \n\nGuidelines for \nEnvironmentally \nSustainable Transport \nSet provisions for \nmonitoring implementation \nand for public reporting for \nan environmentally \nsustainable transport \nstrategy. \n \n\ncooperation for \nimplementing the transport \nstrategy through \ncomprehensive \nconsultation.

It included \npresenting information about the Project on a website and informing town \ngovernment and relevant agencies, schools in the project area, and the \npeople to be affected indirectly and directly by the Project through land \nacquisition and resettlement. \n \nBased on feedback on the Project, primary concerns related to land \nacquisition and resettlement, and environmental impacts from noise and \nairborne dust. \n \nThe implementation of measures specified in the EIAs and resettlement \nplans will be essential. Confirmation of compliance with the EIAs and \nresettlement plans will be monitored. \n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CO2  =  carbon  dioxide,  EA  =  executing  agency,  EIA  =  environmental  impact  assessment,  IWT  =  inland  waterway  transport,          \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n6\n\n4\n1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n \nSTRATEGIC VEHICLE EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN \n\ninherent \n\n \n1. \nThe power to move a vehicle comes from burning fuel in an engine. The main products \nof  the  combustion  process  are  carbon  dioxide  and  water,  but  inefficiencies  and  high \ntemperatures \nin  engine  operation  also  produce  other  by-products  such  as \nhydrocarbons,  oxides  of  nitrogen,  carbon  monoxide,  particulate  matter,  and  their  chemical \ncompounds.  The  emission  of  pollutants  has  global  and  regional  social,  environmental,  and \neconomic  impacts.  Excessive  carbon  dioxide  emissions  increase  global  warming  and  cause \nclimate  change;  nitrogen  oxides  play  a  major  role  in  the  formation  of  acid  rain  in  the \natmosphere,  and  particulate  matter  damages  human  beings  health.  Vehicle  emissions  have  a \ndirect  and  adverse  impact  on  health  and  the  environment.  Reducing  vehicle  emissions  to \nimprove air quality is an important challenge that must be addressed in transport projects. \n \n2. \nIn  general,  the  vehicle  emission  from  individual  vehicles  depends  on  various  factors, \nincluding  the  maintenance  of  the  vehicle,  driving  behavior,  and  road  and  traffic  conditions. \nReduction  of  emission  pollutants  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  case  with  and  without  the \nProject.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  will  continue  to  use  the  existing  road,  which  will  be  more \ncongested,  engines  will  consume  more  fuel  and  produce  more  pollutants  as  a  result  of  slow-\nmoving traffic, inefficient stop-and-go travel, and longer engine running times. With the Project, \ntraffic  will  benefit  from  shorter  distance,  optimal  alignment,  and  less  congestion.  Vehicles  will \noperate  efficiently  without  stop-and-go,  which  will  result  in  lower  fuel  consumption  and  less \nemission  of  pollutants.  Smooth  traffic  flows  will  raise  fuel  efficiency  on  the  project  roads  and \nreduce emissions.  \n \n3. \nThe Project will increase the efficiency of energy use, which will reduce vehicle emission \nper  unit  of  transport.  The  estimation  of  vehicle  emissions  is  based  on  the  relationship  of  fuel \nconsumption,  emission  of  pollutants,  and  vehicle  average  speed.  The  average  fuel  saving  is \nestimated  about  65,572  tons  of  oil  equivalent  (toe)  per  year  and  carbon  dioxide  reduction  is \nabout  211,090 toe  per  year.  On  average,  emission  reductions  will  be \nfollowing: \nhydrocarbons,  2,433  toe  per  year;  nitrogen  oxides,  2,064;  carbon  monoxide,  4,647;  and \nparticulate matter, 50,341. \n \n4. \nAnhui Provincial People\u2019s Government is committed to adhering to the national vehicle \nemission control strategies and plans, which include (i) enforcing stricter emission standards by \nJuly  2010  (GB18352-3-2005  and  GB17691-2005  that  are  equivalent  to  step  IV  of  European \nemission standards); (ii) enforce inspection and maintenance programs for all existing vehicles, \nincluding (a) annual emission checks and random roadside testing, (b) require emission control \ndevices to be repaired, updated, and installed if the vehicle can\u2019t meet the standard, (c) develop \na  quality  audit  system  to  guarantee  the  quality  of  testing  and  prevent  fraud  and  corruption, \n(d) upgrade  vehicle  testing  facilities,  and  (e)  promote  environmental  awareness  regarding \nvehicle  emission  and  fuel  consumption;  (iii)  encourage  the  use  of  cleaner  fuel;  (iv) force \nretirement of vehicles that are more than 8\u201310 years old and have failed the emission inspection \ntest  three  consecutive  times;7  and  (v)  encourage  retirement  of  old  vehicles  through  subsidy. \nTable A7 provides an integrated plan developed to help agencies reduce vehicle emissions in \nAnhui. \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n7   On the vehicle emission spectrum, the older model vehicles and vehicles with poorly maintained or malfunctioning \n\nemission control equipment emit a large percentage of the pollution from on road vehicles. \n\n \n\n\fTable A7: Strategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan: Targets and Expected Outputs \n\n \nProposed Action \n\n \nTarget \nA.

The  XME  will  be  a  139-kilometer \n(km)  four-lane  expressway  linking  the  Xuzhou  area  in  Jiangsu  to  Mingguang  in  Anhui,  thus \ncompleting  a  key  link  in  the  Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing  corridor.  The  present  design  includes  five \ninterchanges  plus  six  reserve  sites  to  connect  the  local  road  network.  The  design  speed  is \n120 km  per  hour  (km/h).  The  XME  will  be  a  shorter  route  between  Xuzhou  and  Nanjing,  two \nimportant transport hubs in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). It will provide an optimized \nlink in the Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing corridor to release traffic congestion in the near future. The XME is a \npriority project of the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \n2. \nThe  start  point  of  the  XME  is  the  provincial  border  with  Jiangsu  Province  in  the  north, \nwith  its  4  km  extension  to  the  Xuzhou\u2013Suqian\u2013Huai'an\u2013Nanjing  Expressway  (Xusuning),  and \nends  at  an  interchange  in  Mingguang  on  the  Bengbu\u2013Nanjing  Expressway  in  the  south.  The \nXME will parallel the existing national highway (NH104), which was upgraded to class II in the \nlate 1980s with a 12-meter width of road pavement. The pavement is generally fair, but the road \nis  poorly  aligned  with  substantial  ribbon  development.  Its  technical  standard  confines  the \naverage speed on the road and road capacity. The average daily motorized traffic in 2008 was \nabout 6,500 vehicles and the average speed on the road less than 50 km/h. The existing road is \nsaturated and cannot meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand. \n \nThe  XME  will  provide  a  shorter  and  direct  route  between  Xuzhou,  Mingguang,  and \n3. \nNanjing  and  beyond.  The  distance  savings  are  50  km  from  Xuzhou\u2013Hefei  (Hehu)  route  via \nBengbu,  28  km  from  Xusuning  via  Suqian,  and  30  km  from  route  of  NH104.  Traffic  will  be \nredistributed upon the project completion. By 2014, Xusuning will mainly serve the traffic to or \nfrom  Huai\u2019an  and  Lanyungang  (an  important  seaport  in  the  PRC);  and  the  Xuhe  will  mainly \nserve traffic to or from Hefei, the capital city of Anhui. \n \n4. \nThe base year for establishing the road network is taken as 2008. Future road networks \nare derived for the project opening year of 2014 and 2020. The traffic origin\u2013destination survey \nand count survey were undertaken in 2007, and updated in 2008. According to the survey and \nanalysis  results,  internal  traffic  in  the  direct  influence  areas  of  the  Project  accounts  for  50%, \ntraffic between internal and external areas accounts for 32%, and the external cross-boundary \ntraffic  accounts  for  18%.  Much  of  the  traffic  on  NH104  would  be  short-  or  medium-distance \ntraffic with either an origin or destination in the immediate areas.  \n \n5. \nThe traffic forecast for the XME uses a standard four-stage travel demand model, based \non 47 zones, including 25 zones in the immediate influence areas, and remainder zones in the \nindirect  influence  areas.  The  model  assigns  traffic  between  each  of  zones  to  anticipated  road \nnetworks  for  two  scenarios,  with  and  without  the  XME,  in  the  series  of  forecast  years.  Traffic \nforecasts  are  based  on  an  analysis  of  economic  growth,  population,  and  vehicle  ownership. \nTraffic  demand  is  projected  separately  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicle  for  2014,  2021,  and \n2033, from the base year of origin and destination matrix and demand elasticity of 1.0 and 0.9. \n \n6. \nThe  traffic  forecasts  allow  for  potential  generated  and  diverted  traffic  as  a  result  of  \n(i) additional traffic generated by the Project because of the lower trip costs in the corridor; and \n(ii)  potential  diverted  traffic  from  other  road  networks  because  of  the  more  direct  and  shorter \nroute to or from same origin and destination. Generated traffic is estimated using price elasticity \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nof minus 0.3 for passenger traffic and minus 0.2 for freight traffic, and is projected to be 10% of \nnormal passenger traffic and 8% of normal freight traffic. \n \n7. \nTraffic is assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone to \nanother make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized costs of travel on \nthe  expressway  and  its  parallel  route,  a  function  of  travel  time,  distance,  associated  toll  cost, \nand affected by road conditions and traffic congestion. The diverted traffic from existing roads is \ncalculated using multiple paths with the capacity restraints trip assignment model. The results of \nthe analysis indicate that an average of 28% of vehicles may be diverted to the XME from the \nXuhe  Expressway  (21%  in  2022),  35%  of  the  vehicles  diverted  from  the  Xusuning  (32%  in \n2022), and the rest diverted from the NH104 in 2014 (47% in 2022).  \n \n\nTraffic  projection  considers  the  effect  of  the  railway  network  changes.  The  high-speed \n8. \npassenger railway of Beijing to Shanghai will divert some traffic from the Xuzhou\u2013Nanjing road \ncorridor.  According  to  the  feasibility  study  of  the  high-speed  railway,  the  railway  origin\u2013\ndestination and travel distance are quite different from project expressway, and traffic diversions \nto the railway are limited. Analysis show that traffic diversions to the railway are 598 passenger \ncar units (pcu) per day in the opening year and 841 pcu per day in the end of analysis year. \n \n9. \nA \"ramp-up\" factor was built in to take into account the experience in previous projects \nthat traffic gradually builds up and often the full potential traffic is not realized for a few years. To \nestimate  this  effect,  the  assumptions  are  made  as  follows: 75%  of  the expected  flow  for  2014 \nand  90%  in  2015.  Traffic  on  the  XME  is  forecast  to  be  around  12,000  pcu/day  in  the  year  of \nopening, and increasing to around 29,000 pcu/day by 2021. The forecast annual growth rate at \nthe initial period of operation is 8%, dropping to 5% between 2021 and 2026, and 4% beyond. \nThe XME will be shorter than the existing routes between Xuzhou, Mingguang, and Nanjing; it \nwill cut travel time by up to 35 minutes for traffic diverting from existing expressways, and by up \nto  45  minutes  for  traffic  diverting  from  the  local  road  network.  Generated  traffic  is  expected  to \nremain minor (Table A12.1). \n \n\nTable A12.1: Traffic Volumes on the Corridor  \n(pcu/day) \n\n2008\n\n2014\n\n2021\n\nItem \nA.

Without the Project, vehicles will \ncontinue to use the existing road network, which will be more congested and result in increased \ntravel  time,  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC),  and  road  accidents.  With  the  Project,  the  corridor \ncapacity will be significantly increased and road congestion will be relieved; vehicles will benefit \nfrom faster, cheaper, and safer travels. The HDM-4 model, a comprehensive road assessment \nprogram, was used to evaluate the road user costs. The economic evaluation uses 2009 prices, \nexpressed  in  CNY  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of \n1.03  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67,  considering  the  lower \nproductivity  and  unemployment  in  the  project  area,  is  applied  to  convert  the  financial  costs  of \nunskilled labor into economic costs. \n \nPossible  alternative  interventions  were  considered  to  meet  the  growing  transport \n11. \ndemand in the project area. Alternative analysis reviewed various options in terms of transport \nmodes, alignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and financing modalities. Options \nwere evaluated in light of environmental impacts, effects on land acquisition and resettlement, \ntraffic flow and safety, and project costs. The recommended project road location and alignment \noption  were  selected  after  the  analysis.  Alternative  financing  modalities  were  considered, \nincluding private sector investment. However, private sector investment was not found attractive \ndue  to  risks  associated  with  construction  and  low  estimated  rates  of  return.  Hence,  public \nfinancing was considered appropriate. \n \n \n \n12. \nThe  economic  costs  include  (i)  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingency,  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  (ii)  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance;  and  (iii)  costs  for  periodic  maintenance  and  replacement  of  depreciated \nequipment.  The  economic  costs  are  derived  from  financial  costs  by  (i)  excluding  taxes  and \nduties, (ii) converting the cost of imported items to domestic prices using the shadow exchange \nrate factor, and (iii) converting unskilled labor costs using the shadow wage rate. \n \n \n \nProject benefits result from improvements in road and traffic conditions as assessed by \n13. \ncomparing with-project and without-project scenarios. The economic benefits include (i) savings \nin VOC, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time tied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from \nfewer accidents, (iv) benefits to generated traffic, and (v) benefits from the reduction of carbon \ndioxide  (CO2)  emission.  These  benefits  are  considered  relevant  and  possible  to  quantify  with \nsufficient accuracy for inclusion in the appraisals.  \n \n14. \nVOC savings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, speed, and congestion; as well \nas changing vehicle compositions for passenger and freight vehicles, and improvements in the \nvehicle\u2019s performance. Traffic on the project roads will enjoy higher travel speeds on a smooth \nroad with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and shorter travel distance. \nSavings in VOC is a main source of economic benefits. \n \n15. \nTravel time savings are obtained when road improvements lead to an increase in vehicle \nspeeds, thus reducing the journey times of passengers. Since the costs of driver and crew are \nincluded  as  a  component  of  VOC,  the  time  savings  focus  on  passengers.  Value  time  savings \n\nBenefits \n\nCosts \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nconsider passenger trips that are work-related and non-work-related, combined with an average \npassenger load per vehicle and produces a passenger time cost per vehicle hour. The values \nused per passenger-hour are CNY9.1 for car passengers and CNY2.4 for bus passengers. Time \nsavings for freight cargos were not quantified because of the lack of reliable data. \n \n16. \nAccident cost savings are based in part of an analysis of national accident statistics for \n2008,  which  were  used  to  establish  the  accident  rate  on  the  expressway  and  part  of  the \naccident data for existing roads. The average accident rate on the expressway is 0.2\u20130.5 million \nvehicle-km  and  1.0\u20131.2  million  vehicle-km  for  the  national  highway.  The  economic  costs  of \naccidents are estimated in terms of direct life and property damage, and forgone income on the \nbasis  of  national  data  for  2008.  The  average  unit  cost  of  accidents  is  CNY112,000  on  the \nexpressways  and  CNY86,500  on  the  national  highway.  The  benefits  of  generated  traffic  are \nestimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness to pay. \n \n17. \nBenefits from reduced vehicle emission were obtained from saving on fuel consumption. \nVehicles  can  drive  at  the  economic  speed  and  shorter  distances  after  project  completion, \nresulting in less fuel consumption, and CO2 and harmful gases emissions. Under provisions of \nthe  Kyoto  Protocol,  certified  emission  reductions  are  presently  valued  in  the  PRC  at \napproximately $10 per ton of CO2 reduced. Other pollutant reduction benefits are attributable to \nthe Project (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and suspended particles), which \nare not quantified in the benefits stream. \n \n \n \nThe Project as a whole generates an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \n18. \nof  15.8%  (Table  A12.2).  The  EIRR  is  15.5%  for  the  project  expressway  and  16.9%  for  the \nproject local roads. The VOC savings are the major economic benefits (53%), followed by time \nsavings benefits, generated traffic benefits, and other benefits. Reductions in accident costs and \nthe  value  of  savings  in  CO2  emissions  are  relatively  small.  The  benefits  of  the  local  roads \naccount for 23% of the total benefits.  \n \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\n \n19. \nThe  results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s  economic \nviability  (Table  A12.3).  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  64%  higher  than  estimated  for  the \nEIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of 12%. The economic analysis model performed the risk analysis \nbased  on  triangular  probability  distribution  for  the  main  input  parameters.  Under  the  tests \nconducted,  if  the  benefits  are  allowed  to  be  50%  of  their  most  likely  values,  the  EIRR  will  fall \nbelow 12%. Considering the experience of ADB in the PRC, such an increase in capital cost or \nreduction in benefits is unlikely. \n \n\n5. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n \n20. \nA  distribution  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government. Road users will receive the largest \nshare of net benefit, accounting for 87% (50% for passenger traffic and 37% for freight traffic) of \nthe total net benefits. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(CNY million) \n\nBenefits\nGenerated\nTraffic\n\n \n \nYear \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n2034 \n \n \n\nCosts \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nCapital \n\n813.5 \n2,367.7 \n1,656.1 \n2,224.7 \n703.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n182.2 \n108.6 \n153.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n182.2 \n141.7 \n200.6 \n0.0 \n(4,435.3) \n \n \n\nO&M \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n34.8 \n51.1 \n53.2 \n55.4 \n57.7 \n60.1 \n62.6 \n65.2 \n68.0 \n70.8 \n73.8 \n76.9 \n80.1 \n83.5 \n87.1 \n90.8 \n94.7 \n98.7 \n103.0 \n84.7 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n   VOC\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n252.1 \n357.4 \n445.4 \n498.6 \n558.2 \n624.8 \n699.4 \n782.9 \n929.0 \n1,102.3 \n1,307.9 \n1,552.0 \n1,841.5 \n2,051.8 \n2,286.1 \n2,547.1 \n2,837.9 \n3,162.0 \n3,523.0 \n3,925.3 \n0.0\n\n  Time\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n31.5 \n53.1 \n72.9 \n87.8 \n105.7 \n127.3 \n153.2 \n184.5 \n217.0 \n255.3 \n300.3 \n353.2 \n415.5 \n471.7 \n535.4 \n607.8 \n690.0 \n783.3 \n889.1 \n1,009.3 \n0.0\n\nAccident\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n19.4 \n34.1 \n46.7 \n50.6 \n54.9 \n59.5 \n64.6 \n70.0 \n76.0 \n82.5 \n89.5 \n97.2 \n105.5 \n110.6 \n116.0 \n121.7 \n127.6 \n133.8 \n140.3 \n147.2 \n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n78.7 \n86.6 \n95.3 \n104.7 \n115.0 \n126.4 \n138.9 \n152.6 \n161.5 \n170.9 \n180.8 \n191.4 \n202.5 \n209.6 \n216.8 \n224.3 \n232.1 \n240.2 \n248.5 \n257.1 \n0.0\n\nCO2 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n0.5 \n0.6 \n0.7 \n0.9 \n1.0 \n1.2 \n1.4 \n1.8 \n2.3 \n2.9 \n3.6 \n4.5 \n5.2 \n5.9 \n6.8 \n7.8 \n8.9 \n10.2 \n11.7 \n0.0 \n \n \n\nLocal \nRoads \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n51.3 \n241.1 \n267.7 \n293.7 \n329.3 \n356.3 \n392.1 \n433.2 \n480.3 \n530.6 \n580.1 \n635.1 \n696.7 \n765.4 \n834.7 \n893.9 \n957.7 \n995.3 \n1,067.0 \n1,189.6 \n0.0 \nEIRR \nNPV \n\nNet\nBenefit\n\n(813.5) \n(2,367.7) \n(1,656.1) \n(2,224.7) \n(304.5) \n721.7 \n875.4 \n980.8 \n1,106.3 \n1,235.2 \n1,386.8 \n1,377.2 \n1,688.9 \n1,919.3 \n2,387.7 \n2,755.5 \n3,186.1 \n3,530.6 \n3,907.9 \n4,310.8 \n4,576.2 \n5,082.9 \n5,574.6 \n6,238.3 \n4,435.3 \n15.80%\n2,743.4\n\nCO2  =  carbon  dioxide,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nItem \n1.

The  Project  has  both  revenue  and  nonrevenue  components.  The  revenue \ncomponent  consists  of  a  toll  road  project,  the  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  Expressway  (XME),  which \nwill  be  implemented  by  the  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company  Limited.  Two \nnonrevenue components will be managed by the Anhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) \nand  the  Anhui  Transport  Administration  Bureau  under  the  overall  management  of  Anhui \nProvincial Department of Transport (APDOT).  \n \nA. \n \n\nRevenue Component of the Project \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n \n2. \nAnhui Province uses the standard system, which sets the same toll on all expressways. \nThe regulation on the administration of toll roads came into force on 1 November 2004, and the \ncurrent  toll  rates  have  been  applicable  since  1  January  2005.  Toll  increases  are  under \ndiscussion and the likely increase would to be up to 15%. Financial analysis of the XME uses a \nconservative assumption of zero increase in the base year toll rate in 2009 (Table A13.1). \n \n\nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls for Passenger Vehicles in 2009 Prices \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \n1\n\u22647 seats\n0.40 \n\nVehicle Class \nPassenger vehicles \nToll rate  \n\n4 \n>=40  seats \n1.20 \n\n2\n20\u201339 seats\n1.00 \n\n2\n8\u201319 seats\n0.70 \n\nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport. \n\n \n3. \n(Table A13.2). The minimum toll rate for freight vehicles is CNY20.  \n \n\nAnhui Province has been implementing weight-based tolls for freight vehicles since 2005 \n\nTable A13.2: Base Year Tolls for Freight Vehicles in 2009 Prices \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \n1\n\u226410 tons \n0.08 \n\n2\n10\u201340 tons\nLinear decrease up to 0.043 \n\nVehicle Class \nFreight vehicles \nToll rate  \n\n3 \n>40 tons\n0.043 \n\nSource: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport. \n\n \n4. \nPeriodic  maintenance  and  infrastructure  rehabilitation  will  be  required  every  9  years. \nDepreciation  is  calculated  using  a  straight  line  method  with  an  average  life  of  40  years. \nCorporate  income  tax  at  25%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n\n \n5. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  40%  by  equity  (32%  by  Anhui  Communications  Investment \nGroup Company Limited and the rest by central and provincial governments) and 60% by long-\nterm loans from Industrial Commercial Bank China and ADB. The ADB loan for the XME is for \n$118.5 million. It will have a 25-year term including a 5-year grace period, and be a US dollar \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan with a 0.15% commitment fee. The projected \nfinancial statements (Table A13.3) indicate that forecast revenue under the base assumptions is \nsufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt repayments on the ADB and \ndomestic bank loans; and generate reasonable profits. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n6. \nThe major assumptions used to calculate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) include \n(i)  all  calculations  are  based  on  2009  prices,  covering  2010\u20132033;  (ii)  capital  costs  include  all \nincremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the expressway, but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  costs  include  all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the XME, but exclude depreciation and debt \npayments; and (iv) a residual value equal to the net book value of capital investment. \n \n7. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after-tax,  in  real  terms,  was \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  considered  include  (i)  the \napplicable 5-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.2% is used for \nADB debt; (ii) the present interest rate of 5.94% per annum is used for the domestic bank loans; \nand (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted \nto  reflect  the  impact  of  income  tax  of  25%.  The  nominal  cost  is  converted  to  the  real  cost  by \napplying domestic long-term inflation rates for local currency and international inflation rates for \nforeign exchange denominated debt. \n\n8. \nThe FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.6% (Table A13.4), which \ncompares  favorably  with  the  WACC,  computed  at  an  after-tax  basis  at  3.7%.  The  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the Project's \nfinancial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A13.5. \n\n3. \n\nSummary XME Financial Results \n\nFinancial Analysis of Nonrevenue Components of the Project \n\n \n9. \nThe  financial  projections  show  that  even  with  tolls  not  increasing  with  inflation  there \nwould be no cash flow deficits and the debt service coverage ratio from the start is above the \nADB  norm  of  a  1.2  after  the  third  year  of  the  XME  opening  to  traffic.  Similarly,  without  toll \nincreases and after tax, FIRR would be 6.6%, well above the 3.7% WACC. With an inflationary \ntoll increase, the situation will further improve. Hence, it can be concluded that the expressway \nproject is financially sustainable and viable.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nOnly  the  XME  component  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  earn  revenue.  Other  project \ncomponents  are  (i)  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  local  roads,  to  be  performed  by  AHAB;  \n(ii) a rural transport pilot project to be carried out by Anhui Transport Administration Bureau, and \n(iii)  institutional  capacity  development.  Even  though  class  I  roads  in  the  country  are  generally \nrevenue-earning, the AHAB-administered local road upgrading from class II to class I under this \nProject are too short to be tolled. Financial evaluation of the nonrevenue components focuses \non fiscal impact on the operating entity. \n \n11. \nThe financial data confirm the availability of sufficient counterpart funds and the capacity \nof  APDOT  and  AHAB  to  finance  both  investment  in  the  Project,  and  future  maintenance  and \noperating  expenses  for  the  project  roads.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  fiscal  impact  and  risks \nare modest. The total capital required for the nonrevenue  project components represents only \n0.4% of past annual APDOT revenues. \n \n12. \nThe total project annual expenditure relating to the nonrevenue components will be only \n2%  of  the  average  annual  expenditure  of  APDOT  from  2003  to  2008.  This  represents  about \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\n10%  of  the  total  AHAB  expenditure  in  2008,  corresponding  to  11%  of  average  annual \nexpenditure  of  AHAB  in  the  past  3  years.  Similarly,  operation  and  maintenance,  including \nperiodic  maintenance,  of  the  upgraded  and  rehabilitated  local  road  components  will  represent \n4.3% of AHAB\u2019s annual historic costs for these items. \n \n13. \nFull debt payments on the nonrevenue component when they become due in 2015 will \nbe  12.4%  of  APDOT's  total  debt  payments  and  1%  of  the  total  revenue  of  APDOT  in  2008. \nThese  low  financial  ratios  indicate  that  the  Project  presents  a  very  modest  financial  risk  with \nrespect to (i) availability of resources to cover the project cost; (ii) operation and maintenance \nneeds,  (iii)  loan  service  requirements  for  the  project  roads,  and  (iv)  financial  burdens  to  the \nprovince. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\nTable A13.3: Projected Financial Statements \n(CNY million) \n2014\n\n \n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nRetained Earnings (Loss) \n\nInterest Income on Cash Balance \n\nTotal Net Gross Revenue \nTotal Operating Costs \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n\nInterest Charge: Long-Term Debt \nInterest Charge: Short-Term Debt \n\n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n879.8  3,500.3  5,447.0  6,833.0 \n6,833.0\n879.8\n\nItem \nIncome Statement \n  Toll Revenue \n \n  Less: Taxes on Turnover \n \n \n \n  Depreciation Expenses \n \n \n  Corporate Income Tax \n  Appropriations of Net Income \n \n \nBalance Sheet \nAssets \n  Current Assets \n  Net Fixed Assets \nTotal Assets \n \nLiabilities and Equity \n  Current Liabilities \n  Long-Term Liabilities \n  Equity \n \n \nCash Flow Statement \nSources of Funds \n  Total Internal Cash Generation \n  Total External Financing \n \nApplication of Funds \n  Total Construction of Project \n  Total Debt Service \n  Total Distributions \n \n \nRatio Analysis \nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio \nDebt\u2013Equity Ratio (%) \nWorking Ratio (%) \nSources: Anhui Provincial Department of Transport;

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Project  will  continue  engagement  with  the  central  and  provincial  governments  in  the  transport  sector,  which  is \nconsidered  a  key  intervention  area  for  poverty  reduction  in  Anhui  Province.  Anhui,  as  the  least  developed  province  in  the \ncentral People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), is a key province of the central Government for poverty reduction because of the \nconcentration of poor in the Dabie Mountain area in the southwest and in the flood-prone Huaibei Plain in the northeast. The \nProject will construct an expressway in the northeast and upgrade or rehabilitate nine existing roads, of which seven are in \nthese two poor areas. The Project will provide more reliable and safe transport services to local people, which will contribute \nto economic development, livelihood improvement, and indirect poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project will directly contribute to implementation of the PRC\u2019s central region development strategy. The main strategies \nof  the  program  include  (i)  revitalizing  old  industrial  cities;  (ii)  accelerating  formation  of  the  central  manufacturing  area; \n(iii) promoting economic cooperation between the central regions; (iv) strengthening the driving effects of central city circles; \nand (v) constructing a growth pole in the central area by resultant force. Under the program, Anhui intends to be the priority \nreceiver of shifting industries from the coastal region. The proposed expressway and local roads will play important roles in \nfulfilling all the strategies for Anhui and for the whole central region. Improved access to eastern cities will attract more labor-\nintensive industries.  \n \nAlso,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  the  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  especially  pillar  I\u2014inclusive  growth  and \nbalanced development. Under pillar I, the strategy states that \u201cADB will help the PRC build a harmonious society and boost \nrural  development.\u201d  Operations  will  be  concentrated  in  the  areas  where  growth  and  development  are  lagging,  focusing  on \ncentral and western provinces. To help the PRC maximize benefits from urbanization and put the economy on a sustainable \ngrowth path, ADB will continue to assist investments in transport, including expressways and railways, needed to integrate \nthe domestic economy and boost the services sector.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nAnhui\u2019s rural poverty incidence (purchasing power parity $1.25) of 10.5% in 2007 is slightly higher than the national average \nof 10.0%. Poverty is concentrated in the Dabie Mountain area and in Huaibei Plain. Huaibei Plain is a major grain production \narea,  however  its  flood-prone  nature  has  restricted  its  economic  development;  also,  agriculture  alone  cannot  support  high \nincome. The main causes of poverty are high population density and limited nonagriculture employment, which results in a \nlarge surplus of rural laborers. Underdeveloped transport is also considered one of the major causes of poverty, especially in \nthe southwest. Consequently, investment in the highway and local roads network is a key intervention for poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project targets both poverty pockets of Anhui, and will significantly help local people and governments to overcome the \ntransport barriers and improve transport services and road safety. As a consequence, it will directly and indirectly contribute \nto poverty reduction. Six of the 14 project beneficiary counties are designated as national or provincial poverty counties in \nAnhui  that  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project.  Rural  poverty  incidence  (based  on  purchasing  power  parity  $1.25)  of \n14 project counties averages 10%. However, the poverty incidence in Yuexi is very high (29.5%) and will benefit directly from \nthe rehabilitation of local road S209. Also, the expressway and upgrading of local road X056 will directly benefit Lingbi and \nSixian  counties,  which  have  a  poverty  incidence  of  19.6%  and  18%,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  percentage  of  people \nearning less than $2/day (CNY2,500) is 25.2% on average for the 14 project counties: 59.8% in Yuexi, 56.8% in Qianshan, \n34.7%  in  Lingbi,  and  34.0%  in  Sixian.  Consequently,  economic  development  needs  to  be  targeted  at  these  densely \npopulated poverty areas. \n \nIn addition to improved transport and  access conditions to and from the  project area, the Project  will  contribute to poverty \nreduction, local economic growth, and social development by facilitating (i) local urbanization, (ii) industrialization in industrial \nparks along the future expressway, (iii) agricultural and animal production through better market access and through setting \nup  processing  enterprises,  (iv)  tourism  development  in  the  Dabie  Mountain  area;  (v)  employment  of  locals  as  unskilled \nlaborers during project construction, and (vi) government social development programs and initiatives that can be integrated \nwith the project resettlement and rehabilitation measures. \n  \n2.  Design Features \nThe highway sections crossing the township centers along the poverty roads will be properly designed with safety and other \nnecessary  facilities  to  enable  better  and  safer  operations  of  local  markets.  A  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP)  has \nbeen  formulated  and  includes  complementary  poverty  reduction  measures  that  will  be  implemented  by  local  government. \nThe  timing  of  these  programs  with  the  project  interventions  will  accelerate  the  benefits  for  the  poor.  Since  the  Project \nconstruction  will  require  a  significant  amount  of  unskilled  labor,  available  surplus  laborers  will  be  identified  by  the  labor \nbureaus  and  hiring  arrangements  will  be  made  with  the  project  contractors.  Such  workers  will  receive  training  and  gain \nvaluable  skills  that  will  make  them  more  employable  after  the  Project.  These  and  other  social  development  measures  are \npresented in the SDAP to improve the inclusiveness of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n61 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nSimilar  to  many  other  areas  in  the  PRC,  although  the  project  counties  are  basically  rural,  agriculture  is  no  longer  the \nbackbone  of  local  economies.  The  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  or  agriculture  to  total  gross  domestic  product  ranges \nfrom  12.3%  to  50.5%  among  these  counties.  In  the  expressway  areas,  the  primary  sector  still  accounts  for  40%\u201350% \nbecause  few  industries  are  currently  located  there.  This  could  change  significantly  due  to  improved  transport  access, \navailability of abundant low cost labor, and the government policy to shift industry from the coastal areas. Twelve of the 14 \nproject counties have per capita gross domestic product below the provincial average; 6 of the 14 project counties have rural \nper capita income below the provincial average. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit 4.0 million local people, of whom 90% are rural residents. No ethnic minority villages are in \nthe  project  area.  All  government  agencies,  townships,  villages,  households,  industrial  park,  and  industrial  enterprises \nconsulted  and  interviewed  support  the  Project.  Three  local  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  will  benefit  three  national  poverty \ncounties  in  the  southwest.  The  new  expressway  and  the  upgrading  of  local  road  X056  will  benefit  two  provincial  poverty \ncounties in the northeast. \n \nThe potential adverse social impacts from the Project include (i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) increased accidents \ndue  to  higher  speeds  and  mixed  traffic,  (iii)  transmissible  diseases  spread  by  the  large  construction  workforce,  and \n(iv) disruption to local communities during construction. The expressway project area is densely populated, so there will be \nno adverse impact to businesses along the existing road network. \n \nRegarding transport services, many informal service providers use vehicles that are consider unsafe, yet provide a source of \nincome for many people and provide low cost transport service. To address this issue, two counties have been selected as \npilot  projects  for  transport  services  to  improve  quality  and  safety,  and  possibly  permit  some  informal  services  that  satisfy \nbasic safety standards. \n \nSince  Anhui  Province  has  more  developed  government  services  and  a  strong  All-China  Women's  Federation,  this  Project \noffers potential to enhance implementation quality and project benefits through greater coordination and involvement of key \nagencies, such as labor and social security, traffic police, centers for disease control, and tourism. There is also potential to \ninvolve  local  communities  in  project  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  since  this  region  has  higher  education  levels \nand greater awareness of modern transport services due to close proximity to Jiangsu and Shanghai. Also, local agencies \nhave already adopted many of the proposed social measures, so the main issue is to determine  what measures are most \nimportant and ensure they are being implemented in an adequate and timely manner. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nAbout 140 villages from 40 townships in 12 project counties were consulted during the project preparatory TA in the process \nof  the  socioeconomic  survey  for  social  analysis  and  resettlement  planning.  Provincial  and  county  government  agencies \nconsulted  include  transport  bureaus,  development  and  reform  committees,  poverty  reduction  offices,  women\u2019s  federations, \nagricultural  bureaus,  land  administration  bureaus,  labor  and  social  security  bureaus,  civil  affairs  bureaus,  and  tourism \nbureaus. In addition, an industrial park and an enterprise within the park were consulted. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nFor road and traffic safety design on two Class I roads, it is planned to have collaborative decision making with the local \ncommunities.  \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nContinuous  consultation  will  be  done  with  stakeholders  during  the  detailed  design  and  construction  stages  led  by  Anhui \nCommunications Investment Group Company Limited, AHAB, and Anhui Transport Administration Bureau. This will involve \nother  local  agencies,  local  communities,  and  affected  people.  For  project  implementation,  the  SDAP  includes  some  key \nsocial  measures  that  will  require  consultation  and  participation.  Also,  the  four  resettlement  plans  include  C&P  plans, \nparticularly to consult with villagers on how to avoid or minimize impacts during construction.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  The  Project  will  not  entail  disparities  and  inequalities  between  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  access  to  the  project \nroads and transport services, to the contrary women could benefit more from the Project\u2019s safety improvement measures in \nthe  towns  and  villages  traversed  by  the  Project's  local  roads  because  women,  children,  and  the  elderly  are  the  main \npedestrians. Environmentally sustainable transport services will result in additional benefits for the community especially for \nwomen and children. \n \nWomen and men have different roles and responsibilities that lead to differences in division of labor, needs, and preferences. \nWomen  and  men  also  participate  differently  in  various  social  activities.  The  presumption  that  domestic  role  and \nresponsibilities  are  women\u2019s  primary  function  can  cause  barriers  for  them  to  participate  effectively  in  various  community \nactivities  and  income-generating  opportunities.  This  also  leads  to  differential  access  to  and  control  over  facilities  and \nservices available in the community. These issues need to be addressed adequately to ensure that provision of rural roads \nand services will also directly benefit women. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n62 \nThe Project will provide necessary provisions for empowering women throughout the project cycle, and anticipates continued \nparticipation of women during planning, implementation, and postconstruction activities. \n\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process:  \n  No action/measure \n\n   Other actions/measures (see Gender Analysis)     \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n \n\n \nThe  SDAP  includes  measures  to  (i)  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  preparation  and  implementation  activities; \n(ii) include women in the design of road and traffic safety for the local roads, (iii) encourage women to provide food service to \ncontractors,  (iv)  hire  women  for  reforestation  and  landscaping  along  roadways,  (v)  hire  women  for  toll  booths  along  the \nexpressway, (vi) improve the cleanliness and lighting for bus stations, (vii) monitor the protection of women's rights regarding \nlabor and re-registration of land and property rights, and (viii) improve  women's awareness of transmissible diseases. The \nSDAP monitoring and reporting includes sex-disaggregated baseline data and gender-specific indicators that form part of the \nproject performance monitoring system.  \n \nThese  measures  will  be  supported  by  relevant  local  government  agencies  and  the  All-China  Women's  Federation,  which \nalready include many of these measures in their routine activities. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nLabor \n\n  Employment  \nopportunities \n\n  Labor retrenchment \n  Core labor standards \n\nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n  HIV/AIDS \n  Human trafficking \n  Others (conflict, political \ninstability, etc.), please \nspecify \n\nSignificant/Limited/\nNo Impact\nSignificant.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n  No     The SDAP includes monitoring indicators, and \n  Yes     \nannual reporting is required as stipulated in the loan assurances. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n63 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  Xuzhou\u2013Mingguang  Expressway  (XME)  and  three  upgraded  roads  (S312,  S105, \nand X056) will necessitate land acquisition and resettlement. Four full resettlement plans were \nprepared  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  procedures.  The  other  six  local \nroads only require road resurfacing or traffic safety measures, so have no land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. The three bus stations will not have involuntary resettlement impacts. The \nresettlement  plans  are  based  on  the  feasibility  studies;  when  the  detailed  design  of  each \nsubproject  is  finalized,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated,  disclosed  to  affected  persons, \nand submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencement of civil works. \n \n2. \nTo avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, consultations with local officials, \nvillage  committees,  and  affected  persons  were  carried  out  for  preparation  of  the  resettlement \nplan.  The  Project  will  affect  129  villages  of  37  townships  and/or  streets  in  9 counties  and/or \ndistricts. The Project will permanently acquire 952 hectares (ha) of land, of which 877 ha (92%) \nare classified as cultivated land. This will partially affect an estimated 16,925 households, which \nassumes the average loss is only 15%. Another 420 ha of land will be occupied temporarily for \nborrow  pits,  spoil  areas,  and  construction  camps;  the  specific  sites  will  be  selected  during \nimplementation in accordance with land use and environmental regulations. Also, an estimated \n108,100  square  meters  of  residential  and  nonresidential  structures  will  need  to  be  removed, \nrequiring the relocation of 921 households and affecting four enterprises with 45 staff. \n \n3. \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome  and  living  standards  in  accordance  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  laws  and \nregulations,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  All  persons  affected  by \nthe  Project  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  assistance.  A  cut-off  date  for  eligibility  for \ncompensation and assistance is the date of project feasibility study approval; notification will be \ngiven  to  all  affected  persons  immediately  thereafter.  For  land  acquisition,  compensation  fees \ninclude  a  land  compensation  fee  and  a  resettlement  subsidy.  The  land  compensation  will  be \npaid to the affected village or affected persons, while the resettlement subsidy will be paid to the \naffected  persons.  The  land  acquisition  compensation  is  based  on  the  comprehensive  average \nannual output value of the land, time a multiple of 16 times. For house demolition, compensation \nwill  be  paid  to  owners  based  on  replacement  cost  without  depreciation,  plus  relocation  and \ntransition  expenses.  Compensation  for  young  crops,  trees,  other  facilities,  and  temporary \nimpacts  will  be  paid  directly  to  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced \nproduction, sales, and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and compensated. \n \nLivelihood rehabilitation strategies and initial village plans for restoration and relocation \n4. \nare included in each resettlement plan. The main income restoration strategies and measures \ninclude cash crop planting, livestock raising, and seeking work outside the province. Assistance \nmeasures  include  employment  in  project  construction,  provision  of  skills  training,  advice  for \nstarting  small  businesses,  and  employment  information  for  all  affected  persons.  Regarding \nhouse relocation, the affected households can rebuild their houses by themselves or can select \nexchange  housing.  All  displaced  households  will  be  allocated  a  free  house  plot  with  basic \nservices \nthe \nfour enterprises,  the  owners  will  be  compensated  with  cash  at  replacement  cost  for  the  lost \nstructure; they can be moved back and rebuilt along upgraded roads. \n \n5. \nSpecial  attention  will  be  paid  to  vulnerable  groups  for  their  relocation  and/or \nthe  Wubao,  disabled,  elderly,  single-parent \nrehabilitation.  Vulnerable  groups \nhouseholds,  poverty  households,  and  households  seriously  affected  by  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  Within  these  groups,  special  attention  and  support  is  also  for  women,  who  may \nface  unique  impacts  or  may  need  assistance  that  is  more  appropriate  to  their  special  needs. \nVulnerable  groups  will  receive  additional  assistance  from  the  Project:  (i)  setting  up  special \n \n\nroad  access).  For \n\n(water,  electricity, \n\ntelevision  cable, \n\ntelephone,  and \n\ninclude \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nsupporting funds in each component, and (ii) providing skill training and arranging employment \nfor affected vulnerable persons. \n \n6. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  expressway  and  three \nupgraded  local  roads  is  CNY606.923  million  including  contingencies  and  land  taxes,  which  is \nabout 7% of the total project cost. The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included as \npart  of  project  budget  and  will  be  funded  by  Anhui  Provincial  People's  Government.  The \npayment  and  usage  of  compensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  the \ninternal  audit  agencies,  with  regular  audit  review.  Detailed  measurement  surveys  will  be \nconducted  and  the  compensation  contracts  negotiated  and  signed  with  village  committees, \nhouseholds, and enterprises. \n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  social  survey  and  initial  consultation  process  were  conducted.  The \npeople  affected  have  been  informed  about  the  key  elements  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement through consultation during the planning stage and information disclosure sessions \nwith the affected people, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage; \ntheir  concerns  are  integrated  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  draft  resettlement  plans  will  be \ndistributed to the affected counties and townships, and resettlement information booklets will be \nprovided to affected villages and affected persons in June 2009. Local governments will set up \nresettlement  offices  to  supervise  implementation,  continue  the  public  consultations,  monitor \nprogress, and deal with grievances. \n \n8. \nAnhui  Provincial  People's  Government  will  entrust  Anhui  Provincial  Department  of \nTransport  (APDOT)  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for  resettlement  management  and \nsupervision.  A  social,  environment,  and  resettlement  office  within  APDOT  will  coordinate  the \nplanning,  implementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nimplementing  agency  for  the  XME  is  the  Anhui  Communications  Investment  Group  Company \nLimited  (ACIG)  and  the  implementing  agency  for  the  nine  local  roads  is  the  Anhui  Highway \nAdministration Bureau (AHAB). The local headquarter offices set up under ACIG and AHAB will \ntake primary responsibility for resettlement supervision, consultation, implementation, and timely \ndelivery  of  entitlements.  A  training  program  will  be  organized  for  ACIG,  AHAB,  and  relevant \nlocal government resettlement officers. \n \nIn  June  2009,  the  Anhui  Provincial  Land  and  Resources  Department  approved  pre-\n9. \nexamination of land use for the XME. The formal procedures for land acquisition are expected to \nbe  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  by  June  2010.  Land  acquisition \ncompensation  procedures  and  payments  will  be  completed  1  month  prior  to  the  start  of  civil \nworks, which are scheduled for March 2010. House demolition will start in March 2010 and be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  2010.  To  ensure  a  short  transition  for  new  house  construction  and \nresettlement  site  selection,  government  approvals  and  preparation  of  village  infrastructure  will \ncommence in August 2009 so that house construction can be completed in 2010. Training and \nincome restoration measures will be carried out from April 2010 to July 2011. Temporary land \noccupation will commence in March 2010; all lands should be restored before the completion of \neach subproject, which is scheduled in 2013. \n \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted in \n10. \naccordance with methodologies specified in the resettlement plans. The terms of reference for \nexternal  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  attached  to  the  resettlement  plans.  Internal  supervision \nand monitoring will be done by ACIG and AHAB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the \nplans.  Resettlement  progress  and  any  key  issues  will  be  included  in  the  quarterly  progress \nreports submitted to ADB. ACIG and AHAB will engage an independent agency for semiannual \nmonitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activity  until  \n2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External  monitoring  reports \nwill be submitted to APDOT and ADB for comments and follow-up actions. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 October 2009) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1465 \nCNY6.8280 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Anhui Communications Investment Group Company Limited \nAsian Development Bank \nAnhui Highway Administration Bureau \nAnhui Provincial Department of Transport \nAnhui Provincial People's Government \nAnhui Transport Administration Bureau \ncarbon dioxide \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \ninternational competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nnational competitive bidding \nnational highway \noperation and maintenance \npassenger car unit \nForeign Fund Project Management Office \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nsocial development action plan \ntechnical assistance \nton of oil equivalent \nvehicle operating cost \nweighted average cost of capital \nXuzhou\u2013Mingguang Expressway \nXuming Expressway Management Company Limited  \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "ACIG \nADB \nAHAB \nAPDOT \nAPG \nATAB \nCO2 \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nICB \nLIBOR \nNCB \nNH \nO&M \npcu \nPMO \nPRC \nSDAP \nTA \ntoe \nVOC \nWACC \nXME \nXMEC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies  ends  on  31  December. \nFY before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2009 ends on 31 December 2009. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", "C.
