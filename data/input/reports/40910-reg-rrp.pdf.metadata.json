With  a  stable  political  regime  and  robust \nmacroeconomic fundamentals, Viet Nam was among the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies in \n2004  and  is  making  good  progress  in  further  improving  its  policy  environment.1  Industry  and \nservices,  together  accounting  for  nearly  80%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  were  the \nmain  sources  of  growth,  recording  10.2%  and  7.4%  growth  respectively,  while  agriculture \nexpanded the slowest at 2.8%. GDP growth is projected at around 7.6% for 2005, 7.6% in 2006, \nand  7.5%  in  2007,  supported  by  strong  domestic  demand  and  export  growth.  Since  2001 \nVietnamese  authorities  have  accelerated  the  implementation  of  structural  reforms  needed  to \nmodernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. Viet Nam's \nmembership in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the establishment of the US-Viet Nam \nBilateral  Trade  Agreement  in  December  2001  have  led  to  even  more  rapid  changes  in  Viet \nNam's trade and economic regime. Viet Nam is working toward accession to the World Trade \nOrganization, which is expected to foster its export sectors.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEmergence of SMEs \n\n \nADB\u2019s Country Economic Review reckons that the development of the private sector is \n3. \nparticularly important in Viet Nam, because it can have a significant impact on poverty reduction \nthrough  its  effect  on  growth  and  employment. 2   Although  the  Government  made  only  slow \nprogress with its State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) equitization (i.e. partial privatization) program, \nthe  private  sector  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  growing  rapidly  since  the  mid-1990s,  and  particularly \nsince the implementation of the Enterprise Law on 1 January 2000, when it became significantly \neasier  to  register  new  private  companies.  Since  starting  the  equitization  program  in  the  early \n1990s, the government has partially privatized 2,450 SOEs. The SME sector, which is the main \nfocus of this Fund, is still largely undeveloped. This is a reflection of the fact that the operation \nof  large  scale  private  sector  enterprises  was  very  difficult  until  the  reforms  of  the  1990s  and \nmost private companies in Viet Nam were established as corporate entities only within the last \n10 years.  \n \n4. \nIt is the growth of these private sector companies that is recognized by the Government \nto  be  the  engine  of  growth.  The  development  of  SMEs  can  contribute  to  poverty  reduction \nthrough  contribution  to  economic  growth,  tax  revenues,  employment  creation  and  individual \nincome. Moreover, the diversification in the economy that will be brought about by SME growth \nin various industry sectors is a stabilizing factor.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2006-2008. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2000. Country Economic Review. Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCambodia and Laos  \n\n3.  \n \n5. \nIn  Cambodia,  private  companies  tend  to  be  smaller  than  in  Viet  Nam,  but  nonetheless \nCambodia  has  a  reasonably  thriving  private  sector.  The  absence  of  a  state-owned  sector  in \nCambodia has made it easier for private companies to establish themselves in all areas of the \ncountry\u2019s economy. In addition to locally founded and managed companies, there are a number \nof private companies founded by overseas Cambodians who returned to Cambodia to establish \nbusinesses. There has also been foreign investment into garment manufacturing businesses in \nCambodia, mainly by Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean companies. \n \n6. \nPrivate companies in Laos are significantly smaller than in Viet Nam. It has been difficult \nfor  the  Fund  manager  to  identify  private  companies  in  Laos  with  annual  revenues  above  $1 \nmillion.  Although  market  reforms  instituted  in  1986  with  the  New  Economic  Mechanism  have \nhad a positive effect on the Lao economy, there are only few registered private companies.  \n \n7. \nAlthough there have been no investments in Cambodia and Laos for Mekong Enterprise \nFund  I,  the  Fund  manager  recognizes  strategic  value  in  keeping  its  investment  mandate \nregional to be able to take advantage of such opportunities if they arise in the future. As regional \nintegration progresses, the Fund may also support Vietnamese companies in their expansion to \nLaos and Cambodia. \n \nB. \n\nChallenges and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nShortage of finance for private sector SMEs \n\n \n8. \nNumerous  market  distortions  still  inhibit  adequate  supply  of  financing  for  private  sector \ncompanies,  in  particular  SMEs,  including:  prioritized  lending  to  SOEs,  restrictions  on \ncompetition  from  foreign  banks,  high  collateral  requirements,  limited  project  appraisal  and \nbusiness review capacity, and lack of transparent financial information. The supply of financial \nservices  for  SMEs  comes  mainly  from  the  four  big  state-owned  commercial  banks,  which \ndominate the Vietnamese market with around 70% of all lending. The state-owned banks have \nhigh  levels  of  non-performing  loans  and  they  still  face  pressure  to  lend  to  state-owned \nenterprises  even  when  commercial  criteria  might  dictate  otherwise.  About  70  per  cent  of  new \nbank credit is currently channeled to SOEs and, when agriculture is removed from the other 30 \nper cent, only a very small amount of lending is actually to SMEs. The leasing industry is small \nwith  the  main  leasing  companies  being  subsidiaries  of  the  state-owned  banks,  and  their  main \nactivities  being  lease  finance  for  their  parent  companies. 3  There  is  an  even  wider  gap  with \nrespect to availability of equity finance. Due to legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign investors \nmainly invest through the foreign investment law and not directly into Vietnamese companies.   \n \n9. \nThe  existence  of  a  private  equity  market  is  still  negligible.  The  first  private  equity  fund \nwas introduced in Viet Nam in 1991. However, an extremely small private sector, slow economic \nand  political  reform,  and  weak  domestic  capital  markets  all  contributed  to  a  shortage  of  good \ninvestments at that time.4 The scarcity of attractive investment opportunities combined with the \nlegal and regulatory limitations on foreign investment and the impact of the Asian financial crisis \nresulted  in  generally  poor  fund  performance.  Since  2000  the  investment  landscape  has  been \nimproving  steadily.  As  mentioned  above,  the  acceleration  of  economic  and  political  reform, \n\n                                                 \n3    Department  for  International  Development,  2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  3\n\nlegislation stimulating the emergence of the private sector, the enactment of trade agreements \nand positive developments in the banking system, such as the opening of a stock exchange in \nJuly 2000, have created a more favorable operating environment for the private equity industry \nand the companies in which it invests. After a prolonged period of almost no activity from 1997 \nto 2001, the private equity industry has restarted operations and new funds have been launched \nin recent years. However, underdevelopment of the stock market constrains the development of \nthe  private  equity  industry.  Please  refer  to  appendix  1  for  a  brief  overview  of  the  securities \nmarket in Viet Nam. These factors contribute to an extremely low private equity investment rate \nof  only  0.03%  of  GDP. 5   Equity  flows  are  further  constrained  by  numerous  investment \nrestrictions, particularly on the use of foreign capital, and by the general opacity of the business \nenvironment, particularly for foreign and institutional investors.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMekong Capital\u2019s contribution to SME finance and development impact  \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n10.  Mekong  Capital  (the  Fund  manager)  has  accumulated  unique  experience  in  SME \nfinance  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  challenging  operating  and  regulatory  environment  through  its  first  fund, \nthe Mekong Enterprise Fund I, which was launched with the support of ADB. This fund is now \nnearly fully invested. The Fund manager has gained a positive reputation with the companies in \nwhich it has invested, which will make it significantly easier to convince the owners of promising \nprivate  companies  that  want  the  Fund  as  an  investor  to  accept  the  Fund\u2019s  governance  and \ntransparency  requirements.  The  Fund  manager  has  dedicated  teams  to  add  value  to  the \ninvestee  companies  in  accounting  and  finance,  process  improvements  and  human  resource \nimprovements. Since transparent  accounting   is  a   key  constraint  in Viet Nam,  the Fund  \nmanager    has    supported    the  investee  companies    to    improve  accounting    and    financial  \nreporting  to  provide  a  foundation  for  the  shareholders  and  managers  to  make  well-informed \ndecisions.  The  Fund  manager  has  also  built  a  strong  core  competency  in  manufacturing \nprocess improvement, which is highly appreciated by portfolio companies and critical for future \nvalue creation. The Fund management team has demonstrated that it is able to introduce and \npromote  best  practices  in  Six  Sigma, 6   lean  manufacturing;  activity  based  costing,  human \nresource systems and management reporting. This capacity building within portfolio companies \ncontributes  to  sustainable  economic  growth  as  the  Fund  popularizes  best  practices  in \nmanufacturing, finance and administration systems among Vietnamese companies.  \n \n11. \nIn  addition,  the  Fund  plays  a  key  role  in  improving  the  corporate  governance  of  its \nportfolio companies thereby removing one of the main impediments to the development of Viet \nNam\u2019s  capital  markets.  The  Fund  helps  to  solve  this  problem  by  working  closely  with  private \ncompanies to implement high levels of transparency and internal controls, and encouraging and \nsupporting them to be listed on Viet Nam\u2019s stock exchange. In the context of a high aversion to \ntransparency  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  private  sector,  the  Fund\u2019s  portfolio  companies  set  a  positive \nexample of the benefits of becoming more transparent. \n \n12. \nThe  Fund  manager  has  started  to  collect  data  on  the  predecessor  fund\u2019s  development \nimpact. In 2004, the predecessor fund\u2019s portfolio companies have added 993 jobs, of which 143 \nwere technical jobs and 26 management jobs. While causality is difficult to establish, it is certain \n\n                                                 \n5  The private equity investment rate as a share of GDP in 2003 was 0.59% in Singapore, 0.47% in the Republic of \nKorea, but only 0.03% in Viet Nam.

Washington, DC. \n\n6  Six Sigma  is  a  highly disciplined process that helps organizations focus on developing and delivering near-perfect \n\nproducts and services. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthat the fund\u2019s equity investments made a key contribution to the SMEs\u2019 expansion and future \nprospects.  \n\n \n3. \n\nA catalyst for regulatory improvements \n\n \n \n13. \nAs the leading institutional investor in private companies in Viet Nam, the Fund manager \nhas  been  among  the  first  investors  to  encounter  certain  regulatory  hurdles  and  takes  an \norganized approach to addressing and resolving them. For example, recently the Fund manager \nhas  been  raising  issues  related  to  remittance  of  dividends  for  foreign  investors  in  private \ncompanies as well as the ownership restrictions on the industries in which foreign investors can \ninvest  in  private  Vietnamese  companies.  Mekong  Capital  maintains  a  Private  Sector  Obstacle \nStatus  Report,  which  has  been  well  received  by  various  members  of  the  development \nassistance  community.  These  reports  have  helped  raise  awareness  of  key  problems  facing \nprivate  sector  companies  in  Viet  Nam  and  investors  in  those  companies.  They  also  help \ninterested parties, including ADB\u2019s Mekong Regional Department and Government agencies, in \ntheir efforts to improve the regulatory environment for private sector development.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED FUND \n\nA. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\nObjectives and Description \n\n \n14. \nThe  Fund  will  focus  its  investment  strategy  on  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs)  with  high  growth  potential  in  Viet  Nam.  The  Fund  may  also  consider  investments  in \nCambodia or Laos, but this will be only on an exceptional basis, because physical proximity of \nthe  Fund  manager  to  portfolio  companies  is  a  crucial  factor  for  successfully  investing  and \nmonitoring SME equity investments. The average investment size is expected to be $2.5 million.  \n \nThe  Fund  aims  to  achieve  an  attractive  net  internal  rate  of return  (IRR)  by  investing  in \n15. \nequity and convertible securities of Vietnamese private and equitized (i.e. privatized) SMEs. The \nFund may also invest in foreign companies or joint ventures with significant operations in Laos, \nCambodia  or  Viet  Nam.  The  Fund\u2019s  primary  focus  will  be  minority  investments,  usually \nrepresenting 20% to 30% of the company\u2019s total equity. The Fund may also engage in buy-outs, \nin  which  the  Fund,  either  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  third  parties,  takes  a  controlling  stake. \nBuy-outs  will  only  be  considered  for  SMEs,  and  will  involve  upgrading  of  management \nprocesses  that  require  the  Fund  manager  to  actively  add  value.  The  Fund  will  also  have  the \nability  to  invest  in  companies  domiciled  in,  or  having  significant  operations  in,  Cambodia  and \nLaos.  Fund  manager  closely  monitors  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  Laos  and \nCambodia, and the experience has been that on an exceptional basis there are companies that \nmight  be  considered  for  an  investment,  in  particular  in  Cambodia.  However,  it  is  important  to \nnote  that  the  Fund  manager\u2019s  investment  strategy  requires  almost  daily  monitoring  of \ncompanies. Therefore, the Fund manager would have to be represented in Cambodia or Laos, \nwhich requires sufficient deal flow to justify the costs.  \n \n16. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe typical target company for the Fund will most likely have the following characteristics:  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  5\n\nTable 1: Target Company Characteristics \n \n\nCharacteristics \nAnnual Revenues \nAnnual net profit \nPre-investment valuation \nAmount of outside equity being sought \nExpected average investment size for MEF II \n\nUS$ million \n\n5\u201315 \n0.5\u20131.5 \n4\u201320 \n1.0\u20135.0 \n2.5 \n\nFund Management  \n\n                             Source: Mekong Capital. \n \nB. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n17. \nThe Fund will be managed by Mekong Capital (the Fund manager).  Mekong Capital is a \nwell-established private equity fund management company with offices in Ho Chi Minh City. In \norder  to  make  investments  in  the  Hanoi  area,  and  to  provide  post-investment  assistance,  the \nFund manager intends  to  open  an  office  in  Hanoi  after  the  initial  closing  of  the Fund.  \nThe Fund manager has promoted and is managing the Mekong Enterprise Fund I (MEF I). This \nis an $18.5 million investment fund, which was launched in April 2002.  \n \nThe  Fund  manager  has  a  strong  private  equity  team  in  Viet  Nam  with  12  Vietnamese \n18. \ninvestment professionals. The history of the private equity industry is short in Viet Nam, which \ntranslates into scarcity of private equity investment skills. In this context, the Fund manager has \nbeen  able  to  develop  systematic  and  well-documented  processes  relating  to  most  areas  of  its \noperations, which has been essential for training investment professionals.  \n \n19. \nThe  Fund\u2019s  focus  on  improving  transparency  and  adding  value  to  its  SME  portfolio \ncompanies is reflected in its operational structure, which has a different emphasis compared to \nconventional  private  equity  funds.  The  Fund  manager  has  set  up  teams  with  an  operational \nbackground  who  solely  focus  on  recruiting  for  management  positions,  improving  accounting \nsystems,  enhancing  corporate  governance, \ntechnology,  and  upgrading \nmanufacturing  processes  by  introducing  Six  Sigma  and  lean  manufacturing.  The  resources  of \nthese  teams,  which  consist  of  employees  of  the  Fund  manager,  can  be  shared  among  all \nportfolio companies: \n \n\ntransferring \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nAccounting  and  finance  team.  The  accounting  and  finance  team  consists \nmainly of former auditor seniors from \u201cbig-4\u201d auditing firms, who are responsible \nfor  providing  assistance  to  companies  in  areas  relating  to  accounting  systems, \ninternal  controls  and  financial  management.  Improving  the  transparency  of \nportfolio companies is also a key requirement for achieving a listing on the stock \nmarket. \n\nProcess improvement team. The process improvement team consists mainly of \nSix  Sigma  black  belts  from  multinational  companies,  who  are  responsible  for \nproviding  assistance  to  portfolio  companies  in  areas  relating  to  production \nmanagement,  quality  management,  production  planning,  data  collection  and \ngeneral process improvement.  \n\n(iii) \n\nRecruitment  coordinator.  The  recruitment  coordinator  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating \nfor  portfolio \ncompanies.  \n\nfinding  experienced  managers \n\nthe  process  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Fund manager has a strong reputation in the Vietnamese market, which is reflected \n\n \n20. \nin its ability to build a good investment pipeline for the Fund \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification of ADB Assistance \n \n1. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n \n21. \nobjectives: \n \n\nBy  providing  financing  to  the  Fund,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following  development \n\nMobilization of long-term capital in the form of private equity for SMEs to \nfinance expansion and productivity increases; \n\nDiversification  of  sources  of  finance  available  for  SMEs  by  inclusion  of \nequity finance, which enables SMEs to buy fixed assets and to use them \nas  collateral  for  commercial  bank  loans  in  order  to  leverage  their \nexpansion.  This  dynamic  process  helps  SMEs \nlarger \nenterprises  and  to  eventually  raise  further  capital  by  listing  on  a  stock \nexchange;   \n\nto  become \n\nteams \n\nDemonstrating  to  the  private  sector  that  investments  in  entrepreneurial \nSMEs  in  the  Mekong  region  can  be  commercially  attractive.  The  private \nequity  industry  in  this  region  is  still  nascent,  and  ADB\u2019s  investment  will \nsupport one of the few domestic private equity teams; \n \nThe Fund manager has developed unique capacity in value addition and \nestablished  dedicated \nfinance,  process \nimprovements and human resource improvements. In particular, the Fund \nwill  improve  SMEs\u2019  competitiveness  by  introducing  best  practices  in  Six \nSigma,  lean  manufacturing,  activity  based  costing  and  management \nreporting;  \n \nImproving  the  transparency  and  corporate  governance  of  SMEs,  and \nthereby  addressing  one  of  the  key  constraints  of  the  Mekong  region\u2019s \ncapital  markets  development.  In  addition,  SMEs  will  increase  their  tax \ncontributions  as  they  are  required  to  adopt  fully  transparent  financial \nreporting.  \n\nin  accounting  and \n\nThe creation of sustainable employment in the  SME sector in Viet Nam, \n(and Laos and Cambodia if the fund invests in these countries); \n\nStimulation of private sector development that will serve as a vehicle for \nthe country\u2019s long-term economic progress and stability; \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  7\n\n(viii)  Contribute  to  the  development  of  a  well  functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment  through  the  reporting  by  the  Fund  Manager  on  regulatory \nissues that their SME portfolio companies encounter. This information will \nbe reported on a regular basis to the Mekong Department to support the \nformulation of a conducive regulatory framework for expanding SMEs. \n\n2. \n\nValue added of ADB  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDemonstration Effect:  Given the significant risks and challenges facing \npotential  investors  as  well  as  the  nascent  nature  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  private \nequity  industry,  ADB  will  serve  a  catalytic  role  in  attracting  additional \nprivate  equity  investors.
