The  report  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA) for  Enhancing \nCommunity  Participation,  Gender  Mainstreaming,  and  Institutional  Capacity  Building  of  Uttar \nPradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL); and if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply,  reduce  the \naggregate  technical  and  commercial  (ATC)  losses  in  electricity  distribution,  and  restore  the \nfinancial sustainability of the rural electricity supply. These will be achieved by converting low-\nvoltage  distribution  lines  to  aerial  bundle  conductors  (ABCs),  separating  the  11-kilovolt  (kV) \nfeeders supplying agriculture consumers from those supplying rural households to facilitate the \nrationing  of  electricity  supply  to  agriculture  consumers,  improving the  financial  management  of \nUPPCL, and deepening community engagement to improve electricity supply cost recovery and \ngender inclusivity in rural electricity distribution\u2013related activities. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\n \nAccess to electricity. Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state with close to 220 million \n3. \npeople, has a poverty rate (29%), higher than the national average (21%) and suffers from lack \nof economic opportunities. In FY2018, its per capita electricity consumption of about 400 kilowatt-\nhours (kWh) was lower than the national per capita consumption of 960 kWh.2 UPPCL added 8 \nmillion rural connections and 1 million urban consumers from 2017 to 2019, raising the rural and \nurban consumer base to 17 million and 9 million, respectively under the SAUBHAGYA scheme \nsupported  by  government  of  India. 3 With  the  completion  of  this  scheme,  Uttar  Pradesh  has \nsubstantially advanced the \u201cenergy for all\u201d objective with a household electrification rate of over \n80% in 2020 compared to around 55% in 2016.   \n  \n4. \nAffordability of electricity and cost recovery. The Uttar Pradesh government has the \npolicy of subsidizing the electricity supply to its poor consumers, and maintained the lifeline tariff \n(for consumption below 100 kWh/month) for residential consumers at \u20b93.35/kWh compared with \nthe  supply cost  of  \u20b97.85/kWh.  Based  on the  socio-economic  survey  undertaken  during  project \npreparation, this rate is considered affordable for the poor with estimated expenditure outlay of \n$200/month/household to meet 60 kWh/month electricity requirement of a typical poor household. \nIn  addition,  the  electricity  tariffs  for  residential  consumers  consuming  above  the  lifeline \nconsumption  and  agriculture  consumers  for  water  pumping  are  also  maintained  below  cost \nrecovery level. UPPCL, a state-owned enterprise responsible for bulk power purchase and power \ndistribution in Uttar Pradesh, required about \u20b960 billion fiscal transfer to cover its cost of electricity \nsupply in FY2018.  \n \n5. \n Furthermore, UPPCL has low collection efficiency, collecting only 77% of billed revenue \nin FY2019. Collection efficiency in rural areas is below 50%, mainly due to rural households\u2019 poor \npayment discipline. Agriculture consumers are supplied by unmetered connections and billed a \nfixed monthly charge based on normative electricity consumption linked to the contracted water \n\n \n\n1  TA  financing  includes  (i)  $500,000  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-others)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); and (ii) $1,500,000 from Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to be administered by ADB. \n2  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Statistics  and  Program  Implementation,  Central  Statistics  Office.  2019.  Energy \n\nStatistics 2019. New Delhi. \n\n3  \u201cPower for All\u201d scheme aimed at providing electricity access to all population.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npump  capacity.  The  tariff  regime  does  not  provide  any  incentive  to  conserve  electricity,  and \nsurveys indicate that farmers tend to overuse electricity. \n \n6. \nTechnical issues of electricity distribution. The rural electricity supply in Uttar Pradesh \nis  characterized  by  (i)  frequent  power  interruptions  and  (ii)  an  overloaded  and  dilapidated \nelectricity  distribution  network.  From  2011  to  2019,  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  Deen  Dayal \nUpadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY)  scheme4 and  its  precursors  provided  \u20b9190  billion  in \ngrants and loans to UPPCL to improve the rural medium-voltage distribution network (33 kV and \n11  kV),  including  separating  the  11  kV  feeders  supplying  residential  consumers  from  those \nsupplying agriculture consumers in selected areas. Although these investments have improved \nthe medium-voltage network, the rural distribution network still requires investment of about \u20b960 \nbillion. \n \n7. \nThe  investments  under  the  DDUGJY  as  well  as  SAUBHAGYA  schemes  have  led  to \nimproved average supply duration in rural Uttar Pradesh from 12\u201313 hours/day before 2017 to \n16\u201318 hours/day in 2019. However, rural electricity supply is still saddled with low performance \nof  distribution  infrastructure,  overuse  of  electricity  by  agriculture  consumers,  low  collection \nefficiency, and poor service to customers. ATC losses stood at 36.8% across Uttar Pradesh in \nFY2019.  The  poor  quality  of  electricity  supply  is  one  of  the  contributory  factors  to  low  socio-\neconomic  development  in  Uttar  Pradesh  compared  to  more  progressive  states  in  India.  The \nproposed project is designed to resolve long-standing technical and financial management issues \nthat  continue  to  significantly  hamper  electricity  sector  performance.  The  project  is  the  first \ninvestment in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s electricity sector financed by an external development partner since \n2001. \n \n8. \nCoronavirus  disease  impacts.  As  a  result  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic,  India\u2019s  economy  is  projected  to  contract  by  9%  in  the  fiscal  year  2020/21,  before \nrebounding sharply with  8.0% growth in FY2021/22, assuming the pandemic wanes in  2021.5 \nWith  revenue  falling  sharply  and  expenditure  rising  to  fight  the  pandemic  and  support  the \neconomy, the fiscal deficit at both central and state level is expected to rise  sharply in FY 2020/21. \nThe  government  of  India  has  arranged  a  liquidity  injection  facility  to  overcome  the  short-term \ncashflow  constraints  of  distribution  companies  such  as  UPPCL  due  to  COVID-19-related \neconomic downturn, and to enable the timely payment to generation companies by distribution \ncompanies.  The  proposed  project  will  complement  post-COVID-19  recovery  efforts  by  the \ngovernment  by  providing  (i)  short-term  benefits  through  construction-related  jobs  including  to \nmigrant workers who were displaced by containment measures; (ii) medium-term improvement to \nUPPCL\u2019s performance, reducing the need for fiscal subsidies; and (iii) long-term benefits through \nimproved electricity supply, attracting investments to industry and commerce. The fiscal space \ncreated  by  reduced  fiscal  subsidy  requirement  to  the  power  sector  will  enable  the  state \ngovernment to allocate additional resources to poverty reduction and social safety nets. \n \n9. \nSector  road  map.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  Uttar  Pradesh  government  have \nagreed on a sector road map under the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme for \nUPPCL\u2019s financial turnaround through debt restructuring and operational efficiency improvement \nin 2016.6 The UDAY road map consists of (i) a financial restructuring plan to improve UPPCL\u2019s \ndebt sustainability, and (ii) an operational improvement plan. The UDAY road map sets out key \n\n \n\n4  Government of India, Ministry of Power. 2020. Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). India. \n5  ADB. September 2020. Asian Development Blog: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila.  \n6  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Power.  2016.  Tripartite  Memorandum  of  Understanding  on  Ujwal  DISCOM \nAssurance  Yojana  amongst  Ministry  of  Power,  Government  of  India  and  Government  of  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  UP \nPower Corporation Limited. New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nperformance indicators for UPPCL to rectify its structural weaknesses (paras. 4\u20137): (i) reduction \nin ATC losses from 42.6% in FY2016 to 15.0% by FY2020; and (ii) complete elimination of the \ngap  between  the  average  cost  of  supply  (ACS)  and  the  average  revenue  realized  (ARR)  by \nFY2020, which stood at \u20b90.43/kWh in FY2016.7  \n \n10. \nIn line with UDAY\u2019s financial restructuring plan, the Uttar Pradesh government took over \n75% of UPPCL\u2019s debt, totaling \u20b9392 billion (as of September 2015, the outstanding debt was \u20b9532 \nbillion). The government then transferred that amount back to UPPCL and its DISCOMs in the \nform  of  equity  (\u20b998  billion),  a  grant  (\u20b9196  billion),  and  interest-free  loans  (\u20b998  billion).  The \nexercise,  completed  on  31  March  2017,  significantly  reduced  financial  losses  in  FY2016  and \nFY2017.  \n  \nUnder  UDAY\u2019s  operational  improvement  plan,  several  operational  measures,  and \n11. \ninvestments to reduce ATC losses are under implementation, along with the measures supported \nunder DDUGJY. UPPCL has entered into an agreement with Energy Efficiency Services Limited \nto install 4 million smart meters in urban areas, of which more than 1.35 million had been installed \nas of 31 July 2020.8 Since 2018, UPPCL has also installed more than 8.5 million conventional \nmeters in rural areas to convert unmetered connections to metered ones; the remaining 2 million \nrural consumers will have metered connections by 31 March 2021. All new consumers connected \nsince 2017 have metered connections that enable the poor to maintain their monthly electricity \nconsumption at an affordable level. All 11 kV feeders are now metered and subjected to regular \nenergy audit to identify feeders with high ATC losses and requiring corrective action. \n \n12. \nThe above measures reduced ATC losses from 42.6% in FY2016 to 36.8% in FY2019 but \nraised the ACS\u2212ARR gap from \u20b90.43/kWh in FY2016 to \u20b90.74/kWh in FY 2019. The expansion \nof  distribution  network  and  addition  of  large  number  of  rural  consumers  under  SAUBHAGYA \nscheme have adversely impacted the progress in ATC loss reduction and narrowing of ACS\u2212ARR \ngap, while delayed tariff adjustment in 2019 also widened the ACS\u2212ARR gap. In partnership with \nADB,  UPPCL  intends  to  undertake  investments  towards  achieving  the  performance  targets \nspecified under UDAY, including (i) completing segregation of 11 kV feeders supplying unmetered \nagriculture  consumers  from  those  supplying  residential  consumers,  which  is  a  prerequisite  for \nrestricting  the  duration  of  electricity  supply  to  the  separated  feeders  supplying  agriculture \nconsumers;  and  (ii)  converting  rural  low  voltage  distribution  lines  to  ABCs  to  prevent  illegal \nconnections.  \n \n13. \nThe project is designed to enable UPPCL to undertake the investments described in para. \n12 to achieve the key performance indicators of UDAY road map. Implementation of the project, \nincluding  the  financial  management  action  plan  (FMAP)  along  with  other  measures  being \nimplemented  as  above,  is  expected  to  enable  UPPCL  to  reduce  ATC  losses  to  14.9%  and \neliminate  the  gap  between  ACS  and  ARR  by  FY2029,  originally  targeted  to  be  achieved  by \nFY2020  under  the  UDAY  memorandum  of  understanding.  Improved  cost  recovery  of  rural \nelectricity supply resulting from the project will enable UPPCL to increase supply duration in rural \nareas.9 The  improved  electricity  supply  will  expand  non-farm  employment  opportunities  for  the \nrural poor. Reduced fiscal transfers to the electricity sector because of improved cost recovery \nwill  enable  the  Uttar  Pradesh  government  to  allocate  additional  fiscal  resources  for  poverty \n\nelectricity below supply cost.  \n\n \n\n7  The ACS\u2013ARR gap is calculated after considering the state government\u2019s revenue subsidies to UPPCL for supplying \n\n8  ADB.  2019.

The project is also increasing collection efficiency in rural areas by supporting UPPCL \nin  pilot  testing  the  mobilization  of  community  agents,  including  women\u2019s  self-help  groups \n(WSHGs),10 to collect electricity bills.  \n \nPolicy framework. The policy and regulatory framework governing the electricity sector \n14. \nin  India  and  Uttar  Pradesh  aims  to  promote  least-cost  electricity  supply  and  full  cost  recovery \nthrough appropriate electricity tariffs, coupled with revenue subsidies from the state government. \nThe Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) regulates the electricity sector in \nUttar Pradesh. UPERC determines the tariffs for different consumer categories to recover ACS \nafter allowing for certain level of cross subsidies from industrial and commercial consumers to \nagriculture and residential consumers. The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to keep the \ntariff below the cost recovery level for residential consumers using less than 100 kWh/month and \nfor  agriculture  consumers.  It  has  been  compensating  UPPCL  through  statutory  transfers  as \nrequired under the Electricity Act, 2003 to supply electricity to poor households and agriculture \nwith a tariff below the ACS. \n \nUPERC determines the aggregate revenue requirement of UPPCL to provide adequate \n15. \ncashflows to meet the eligible expenses based on certain normative efficiency standards and earn \na regulated rate of return on the equity capital. However, because of operational inefficiencies \nand  the  prevalence  of  unmetered  connections,  UPPCL  does  not  operate  at  the  normative \nefficiency  standards  set  by  UPERC  for  ATC  losses.  The  regulatory  framework  is  designed  to \nencourage  UPPCL  to  operate  at  the  normative  efficiency  standards  stipulated  by  UPERC, \nhowever UPPCL\u2019s underperformance in reducing ATC losses and improving collection efficiency \nis resulting in financial losses. The proposed investments under the project will provide substantial \nassistance  to  UPPCL  to  improve  its  operational  performance  and  meet  UPERC\u2019s  normative \nefficiency  standards.  This  will  enable  UPPCL  to  eliminate  the  gap  between  ACS  and  ARR  and \nreduce its financial losses. \n \nStrategic context. Improving the rural electricity distribution and ensuring cost recovery \n16. \nin electricity sector are recognized as key developmental challenges in India due to its impacts \non  rural  economic  development  and  the  state\u2019s  fiscal  sustainability.  The  proposed  project  is \nclosely aligned with all three pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India11 on (i) boosting \neconomic  competitiveness  by  expanding  infrastructure  networks  through  improved  electricity \ndistribution in rural Uttar Pradesh; (ii) providing inclusive access to electricity network to poor and \nvulnerable in rural areas in Uttar Pradesh; and (iii) addressing climate change by reducing the \nwasteful energy and water consumption in agriculture and residential sectors through illegal use \nof electricity. It is also consistent with the recent Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s Sector-\nWide Evaluation of ADB Energy Policy and Program, 2009\u22122019 which recommended ADB to \nincrease  the  support  to  sector  reforms  and  distribution  network  enhancement  to  promote \noperational efficiency improvement.

The \nimproved electricity supply is expected to create non-farm employment \nopportunities to the poor. \nThe  project  will  promote  gender-sensitive  workplace  practices  in \nUPPCL and will pilot test the engagement of WSHGs as bill collection \nagents.  \nThe  project  will \nimprove  water  and  energy  conservation  by \nencouraging water use efficiency in agriculture. The rural distribution \nnetwork  will  also  be  rehabilitated  in  a  climate  and  disaster  resilient \nmanner to withstand floods and storms.   \nThe project will promote economic development in rural Uttar Pradesh \nby improving efficiency and duration of electricity supply for agricultural \nproduction,  other  potential  non-farm  activities,  and  residential  use.\n \nThe  project  will  strengthen  the  corporate  governance,  financial \nmanagement capacity, as well as financial sustainability of UPPCL and \nits subsidiaries.  \n\n \n\nOP = operational priority, UPPCL = Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited; WSHG = women\u2019s self-help groups. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nA. \n \n18. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: quality and financial cost recovery in the \npower supply in Uttar Pradesh improved.14 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, \nreliability, and sustainability of power supply in rural areas improved.15 \n \nB. \n \nOutput  1:  Rural  electricity  distribution  network  improved.  This  will  consist  of  22 \n19. \nsubprojects that will convert 65,000 km of rural voltage distribution network from bare conductors \nto ABC in about 46,000 rural habitations in Uttar Pradesh (each with more than 1,000 people) \nwith a total population of about 70 million. Rural communities, including women, will be trained on \nsafe  and  efficient  use  of  electricity.  These  measures  will  improve  the  reliability  and  safety  of \nelectricity distribution, and boost cost recovery by discouraging illegal connections.  \n \n20. \nOutput 2: Systems for separating electricity distribution for agriculture consumers \nfrom residential consumers established. This will consist of 13 subprojects to separate  11 kV \nfeeders  (1,100  feeders  with  a  total  length  of  17,000  km),  that  supply  273,000  agriculture \nconsumers and 2.42 million households. A parallel network of 11 kV feeders, with a total length \nof about 17,000 km, will be built under this component to connect the distribution transformers \nsupplying  residential  consumers,  while  using  the  existing  11  kV  feeders  to  supply  agriculture \nconsumers.  The  project  will  enable  UPPCL  to  increase  the  duration  of  power  supply  to  rural \nhouseholds from 18 hours/day to 22\u201324 hours/day and control the supply duration to agriculture \nconsumers to match the seasonal water requirement. The expected result is reduced wastage of \n\n14 Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh. 2017. 24X7 Power For All.

The  attached  TA  will  finance  (i) \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  FMAP 16  to  improve  UPPCL\u2019s  corporate  governance;  (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of UPPCL and its subsidiary DISCOMs to manage accounts receivable \nby, for  example, reconciling  receivable  balances,  conducting  aging  analysis,  and  developing  a \nprovisioning policy for the accounts receivable; (iii) developing and pilot testing innovative pro-\npoor bill collection strategies involving active participation of 1,000 rural individuals, including rural \nwomen\u2019s  self-help  groups  (WSHG)  as  collection  agents;  and  (iv)  pilot  testing  gender-sensitive \nworkplace practices and improving working conditions for contractual workers, especially women, \nin 10 contractors of UPPCL.  \n \n22. \nUse of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.17 The Uttar Pradesh government has a well-structured sector road map and \npolicy framework to improve the quality, reliability, and financial sustainability of electricity supply, \nas described in the UDAY memorandum of understanding (footnote 6). Although the targets set \nin the memorandum of understanding have not been met within the stipulated time frame, UPPCL \nhas  initiated  the  agreed  measures  and  the  Government  of  India  closely  monitors  their \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s long-term engagement through the project will provide financing certainty \nduring  the  MFF  period  to  UPPCL  and  the  contractors  while  minimizing  the  risk  to  the  state \ngovernment  of  project  implementation  delays  and  the  resulting  financial  charges.  The  MFF \nmodality provides a framework for ADB to monitor the implementation progress of the sector road \nmap, consistency of subprojects with the policy framework, and project implementation over the \nduration of the MFF.  \n \n23. \nThe project consists of two tranches, time-sliced on  disbursement basis, and divided into \n35  subprojects,  of  which  26  will  be  financed  by  ADB  under  the  MFF  and  9  by  UPPCL  using \ncounterpart funds. The implementing agencies have already awarded the contracts for the nine \nsubprojects (under output 1) to be financed with counterpart funds, using national procurement \nprocedures. Out of the 26 subprojects to be financed by ADB under tranche 1, 13 subprojects will \nsupport output 1 (para. 19) and 13 subprojects will support output 2 (para. 20). Each subproject \ncovers  project  activities  in  3\u20134  administrative  districts.  The  MFF  modality  using  time-sliced, \ndisbursement-based tranches enables the approval of ADB financing under tranche 2 to be linked \nto progress in contract execution and disbursement. \n \n24. \nScope of tranche 1. All 26 ADB-financed subprojects (as described in para. 23) will be \nstarted under tranche 118 and continued under tranche 2 by the same contractor procured under \ntranche  1.  This  will  ensure that  tranche  1  project  activities  will  be  representative  of  the  overall \nproject,  and  that  tranche  1  will  cover  70%  of  the  MFF  ceiling  amount.  The  nine  subprojects \nfinanced  from  counterpart  funds,  and  output  3  to  be  financed  by  the  attached  TA  will  be \nimplemented and completed during the tranche 1 implementation period. All work contracts and \nconsulting  contracts  under  the  project  have  been  tendered,  and  tender  evaluation  has  been \nsubstantially completed. Upon achieving 75% of disbursement under tranche 1, the government  \n\n \n\n16 Financial Management Action Plan is available in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n17 Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nwill submit the periodic financing request for tranche 2 to complete the remaining scope of each \ncontract.  \n \n25. \nInnovative  approaches.  The  proposed  pro-poor  community  electricity  bill  collection \ninitiatives using WSHGs will facilitate more regular bill collection and increase the income of the \nrural women engaged as collection agents. ADB will assist UPPCL in pilot testing models and \nincentive  structures  to  engage  community  organizations,  including  WSHGs,  as  electricity  bill \ncollection agents. Upon successful demonstration, this scheme can be replicated in other parts \nof the country and solve the problem of bill collection in rural areas where use of smart meters is \nnot viable, provide income to women, and increase gender inclusivity in the electricity sector. \n \n26. \nValue added by ADB. The technical specification for distribution network rehabilitation \nincorporates the latest performance standards for distribution network design. UPPCL followed \nADB  Procurement  Guidelines  in  procuring  the  contractors.  ADB,  in  consultation  with  UPPCL, \ndesigned an elaborate two-tier project implementation monitoring and supervision arrangement \nto  ensure  construction  quality.  ADB  has  trained  UPPCL  staff  members  on  ADB  procurement, \nproject  implementation,  and  safeguard  requirements.  UPPCL  is  expected  to  use  these  good \npractices  in  domestically  financed  investments.  The  FMAP  implementation  will  strengthen \nUPPCL\u2019s financial management capacity and corporate governance. Although UPPCL\u2019s financial \nsituation  is  not  conducive  for  nonsovereign  financing,  improved  financial  performance  and \ncorporate  governance  will  enable  UPPCL  to  explore  nonsovereign  financing  after  project \ncompletion. \n \n27. \nLessons  learned.  ADB  financed  power  distribution  network  expansion  in  the  state  of \nMadhya  Pradesh  under  two  MFF  programs.19 They  included  the  separation  of  11  kV  feeders \nsupplying  agriculture  and  from  those  supplying  residential  consumers.  The  performance \nevaluation  report  for  the  first  MFF  program20 noted  a  reduction  in  ATC  losses  from  42.4%  in \nFY2007 to 29.1% in FY2019. It also noted that while technical losses could have been reduced \nthrough  the  project  interventions,  the  project  design  did  not  include  a  specific  component  to \nreduce  commercial  losses  and  improve  bill  collection  efficiency.  The  design  of  the  proposed \nproject incorporates these lessons by including components that specifically address collection \nefficiency and commercial loss reduction. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe project is estimated to cost $800 million, including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges  during  implementation  (table  2).

The TA will (i) pilot test innovative bill \ncollection strategies involving active participation of rural women, including awareness building \n\n23 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\non  safe  and  efficient  use  of  electricity;  (ii)  establish  gender  sensitive  workplace  practices  in \nUPPCL; (iii) improve revenue management capacity of electricity DISCOMs by supporting FMAP \nimplementation; and (iv) improve UPPCL group\u2019s project management and safeguard compliance \ncapacity. \n \n34. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2,250,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) and (ii) $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. UPPCL will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n35. \nADB staff members undertook technical due diligence of the project to establish the need \nto rehabilitate the distribution network by (i) converting the low-voltage network to ABCs, and (ii) \nseparating the 11 kV feeders supplying residential consumers from those supplying agriculture \nconsumers. Electricity  distribution companies in several Indian states have converted their low-\nvoltage networks to ABCs and successfully reduced technical and commercial losses in electricity \ndistribution. Feeder separation enables the DISCOM to control the duration of electricity supply \nto agriculture consumers to limit overconsumption by unmetered agriculture consumers. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis.  ADB staff members conducted the economic analysis of the project \n36. \nfollowing  ADB  guidelines.  The  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  costs  and  benefits  in  FY2019 \nconstant  prices  for  FY2020\u2013FY2050.  The  economic  benefits  mainly  come  from  behavioral \nchanges  to  conserve  electricity  induced  by  project  interventions  as  described  in  the  economic \nanalysis.24 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  project  is  economically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  14.5%,  and  the \nproject\u2019s  expected  net  present  value is  \u20b922.6  billion  at  an  economic  discount rate  of  9.0% per \nyear. The sensitivity of the EIRR was assessed for the following adverse scenarios: (i) insignificant \nconsumer behavior changes, (ii) reduction in the generation cost, and (iii) reduction in willingness \nto pay for electricity. The project\u2019s economic viability is robust under these adverse scenarios. \n \n37. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  of  the  project  followed  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for \nfinancial  management  and  analysis  of  projects. 25 The  analysis  did  not  quantify  COVID-19\u2019s \nfinancial  and  economic  impacts  as  these  are  expected  to  last  12\u201318  months  and  will  not \nsignificantly  affect  the  project  over  its  lifetime.  However,  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  run  on \npossible project implementation delays because of COVID-19. The project\u2019s estimated financial \ninternal rate of return in real terms is 10.38% compared with the project\u2019s weighted average cost \nof capital in real terms of 4.0%. ADB staff members performed an analysis to assess the sensitivity \nof the financial internal rate of return to adverse changes in key variables, including (i) less-than-\nexpected decrease in distribution losses, (ii) increase in operation and maintenance costs, and \n(iii)  delay  in  project  completion.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the  project\u2019s \nfinancial viability under these adverse scenarios. \n \n\n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nGovernance \n\nUPPCL\u2019s  historical  financial  performance  (FY2015\u2013FY2019)  and  financial  projections \n38. \n(FY2020\u2013FY2029)  are  summarized  in  the  financial  analysis  (footnote  25).  UPPCL\u2019s  financial \nlosses were \u20b970 billion and accounts receivable totaled \u20b9689 billion in FY2019. Key factors that \nadversely affect UPPCL\u2019s financial performance include (i) low collection efficiency that has led \nto a buildup of an unsustainable level of accounts receivable, contributing to an operating cash \nflow  deficit  and  inability  to  timely  settle  power  purchase  dues,  and  compelled  UPPCL  and  its \nsubsidiaries  to  borrow  additional  funds  for  working  capital;  (ii)  distribution  loss  exceeding  the \nnorms set by UPERC for tariff determination, leading to higher power purchase cost which is not \nallowed to be recovered from approved tariff by UPERC; and (iii) a highly leveraged debt position \nthat has made it difficult for UPPCL to service its debt obligations. UPPCL\u2019s weak financial status \nprecludes private financing of the sector. \n \nUPPCL has agreed on key financial covenants in the loan agreement26 to progressively \n39. \nimprove its financial health. The covenants will help ensure that UPPCL (i) is able to service its \ndebt obligations in a timely manner; (ii) increases its collection efficiency and progressively brings \ndown its accounts receivable; (iii) receives adequate equity injections from the state government \nto finance capital expenditure, reduce its leverage, and strengthen its financial position; and (iv) \nsubmits annual requests for tariff revision. The project supports various technical measures that \nUPPCL is implementing to reduce ATC losses, reduce the accounts receivable from 498 days of \nrevenue billed in FY2019 to 90 days of revenue billed in FY2029, and lower its power purchase \nrequirements. \n \nC. \n \nUPPCL\u2019s operations and tariffs are regulated by UPERC. UPPCL subsidiary companies, \n40. \nthe project\u2019s implementing agencies, have limited autonomy and UPPCL manages their finances. \nUPPCL  has  successfully  implemented  several  large  projects  financed  by  domestic  financial \ninstitutions,  such  as  Power  Finance  Corporation  and  Rural  Electrification  Corporation,  under \ngovernment procedures. However, UPPCL\u2019s overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nsubstantial because of unreconciled interunit and intercompany balances, the lack of a completed \nfixed  assets  registry,  high  levels  of  accounts  receivable,  delays  in  annual  external  audits,  and \ninadequate internal control systems. \n \n41. \nA breach of fiduciary management of the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees \nTrust (UPSPSET)27 was exposed in 2019.  UPSPSET financial assets were allegedly invested in \na  nonbank  financial  institution  without  requisite  approvals  from  UPSPSET  trustees,  and \nUPSPSET might lose a significant amount of its assets because of the liquidation of the nonbank \nfinancial institution. UPPCL has informed ADB that it will take actions to strengthen UPSPSET\u2019s \nfiduciary management and prevent similar incidents. Actions include (i) the election of employee \nrepresentatives  to  the  UPSPSET  board  of  trustees  and  investment  committee,  (ii)  strict \ncompliance with investment norms stipulated by the Government of India for pension funds, and \n(iii) the provision of online information on UPSPSET\u2019s investment performance. \n \n42. \nUPPCL  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  prepared  an  FMAP  to  improve  UPPCL\u2019s  corporate \ngovernance  and  financial  management  as  described  in  the  FMA.28 Key  time-bound  actions  to \nimprove corporate governance include (i) appointing independent directors to the UPPCL board, \n\n \n\n26 Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 UPPCL has established UPSPSET to manage the pension fund of its employees, and senior managers of UPPCL \n\nact as the trustees of UPSPSET. \n\n28 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n(ii)  updating  the  financial  management  manuals  and  training  staff,  (iii)  preparing  fixed  assets \nregisters, (iv) reconciling interunit and intercompany balances and preventing the recurrence of \nunreconciled  balances,  and  (v)  strengthening  the  finance  function  by  filling  vacancies.  Key \nelements of the FMAP are included in the framework financing agreement and as loan covenants. \nThrough the attached TA, ADB is helping prepare a policy to recognize the impairment of accounts \nreceivable to enable UPPCL to comply with the Indian Accounting Standards. \n \n43. \nUPPCL  has  a  well-developed  procurement  system  based  on  state  government \nprocurement regulations. The procurement processes are adequate to satisfy ADB requirements \nwith  only  minor  adjustments.  The  project  procurement  activities  have  been  substantially \ncompleted following ADB's Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The overall \nprocurement  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate.  Value  for  money  is  achieved  through  (i)  strategic \ncontract packaging, (ii) use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system, and (iii) the application of \nlowest evaluated cost as the evaluation criterion. \n \n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the central and state governments and UPPCL. ADB undertook integrity due diligence and \nidentified no significant integrity risks, except for the incident described in para. 42. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n \n45. \nUttar Pradesh\u2019s rural areas are plagued by a lack of jobs, high labor migration to urban \nareas such as Delhi, and water stress because of depleted groundwater. A large proportion of the \nareas\u2019 population lives below the poverty line. The project will improve the quality, reliability, and \nduration of electricity supply in selected rural areas, which would encourage investment in industry \nand commerce, and creation of employment opportunities for the poor. Proposed revisions to the \nElectricity Act, 2003 require the state government to make direct cash transfers to subsidize the \nlifeline consumption of the poor. The direct cash transfers will alleviate the short-term impacts on \nthe poor caused by enforcement of payment discipline and prevention of illegal connections.29 \n \n46. \nGender.  Tranche  1  of  the  MFF  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and \nincorporates specific measures as described in the gender action plan.30 The project will pilot test \nengaging rural women through WSHG as community collection agents and use of incentive-based \ncompensation  scheme for the  collection  agents.  The  project  will  develop  UPPCL\u2019s  institutional \ncapacity  to  promote  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  including  establishing  gender-\nresponsive human resource practices for UPPCL staff members and contract workers. \n \nE. \n \nFollowing  the  special  MFF  requirements  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \n47. \nADB,  in  consultation  with  UPPCL,  prepared  a  safeguard  assessment  and  review  framework \n(SARF).31 The  SARF  combines  the  requirements  of  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework,  and  a  resettlement  framework  as  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the \nsubprojects  are  anticipated  to  be  limited.  The  SARF  provides  guidance  to  UPPCL  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  on  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguard  due  diligence  to  be \nundertaken  during  project  implementation.  ADB  has  disclosed  the  SARF  on  the  ADB  website. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Safeguard Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nUPPCL  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  committed  to  implement  the  safeguard \nrequirements. ADB will provide training through the attached TA. \n \n48. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  potential  project  impacts  will  generally  be  minor  and \ntemporary during construction, although health and safety risks to workers and the community \nwill remain during operation and maintenance. ADB, in consultation with UPPCL, has prepared \nan initial environmental examination (IEE)32 based on potential sample project activities following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national environment, health, and safety requirements. \nThe  IEE  has  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  IEE  includes  a  project  environmental \nmanagement  plan  reflecting  international  good  practice.  The  IEE  and  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  will  be  updated  if  required  to  reflect  any  site-specific  requirements  before \nconstruction work starts. \n \n49. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project involves installing 11 kV distribution \ninfrastructure  in  the  substations  without  requiring  land  acquisition.  Potential  impacts  of  the \ndistribution  infrastructure  on  involuntary  resettlement  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant.  The \ndistribution lines will follow the right-of-way of the roads in most cases, but might require installing \nelectricity poles on private land in some cases (less than 2%) and only after obtaining the consent \nof the private landowners. Impacts will be avoided and mitigated, and compensation will be given \nfor  the  residual  impacts.  ADB  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan33 for  the  project  based  on  a \nrepresentative sample survey of project activities for the 11 kV feeder separation component. \n \n50. \npopulations, and the project will not impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n51. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  areas  are  not  inhabited  by  indigenous \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nUPPCL does not have experience in implementing a \nproject financed by a development finance institution. \nCOVID-19 might further exacerbate the project \nimplementation risk. \nConsumers\u2019 low ability to make timely payments is \nexacerbated by unexpected macroeconomic \ndisruptions such as COVID-19. \n\nHigh accounts receivable and low collection efficiency \nimpact the financial viability of UPPCL and its \nsubsidiaries. \n\nThe Uttar Pradesh government has directed UPPCL to \nmaintain the electricity tariffs for residential and \nagriculture consumers below the supply cost. Timely \nand full subsidy payments from the state government \nmight not happen because of fiscal constraints.  \n\n \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nthe  project \n\nimplementing  agencies  are \nUPPCL  and \nsupported by  experienced project management consultants \nfinanced under the loan. A cloud-based project management \nsystem will be established to track project implementation. \nThis risk is beyond the project\u2019s control because it is related to rural \nincome  growth  and  mitigation  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  rural \nincome.  The  government  may  consider  partial/  full  waiver  of \nconsumer receivables during  the pandemic and one-time fiscal \ntransfer to UPPCL subject to availability of fiscal space.  \nA detailed action plan with time bound targets to reduce the \naccount receivables is in the FMAP. Under the recent liquidity \ninjection program by PFC to UPPCL, smart meters with direct \ndebit facility is to be installed for government buildings.  \nThe  Uttar  Pradesh  government  has  consistently  paid  the \nthe \nsubsidy,  and  complied  with \nElectricity  Act,  2003  and  commitments  under  the  UDAY \nMOU. In line with FMAP, close dialogue will be maintained to \npursue the timely payments.  \n\nits  obligations  under \n\n32 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 A separate resettlement plan is not required for tranche 2 as the same contracts will continue in tranche 2. \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nRisks \nUPPCL has an institutional weakness in financial \nmanagement. Its existing financial management \nsystem is not commensurate with the size of UPPCL. \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease,  ERP = enterprise resource planning, FMAP = financial management action plan, \nMOU = memorandum of understanding, PFC=Power Finance  Corporation, TA = technical assistance, UDAY = Ujwal \nDISCOM Assurance Yojana, UPPCL = Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n\nMitigation Measures \nUPPCL with the assistance of ADB, has prepared an FMAP \nto address these weaknesses, and its key aspects including \nestablishing an ERP are included in the legal agreements. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n52. \nThe government and UPPCL have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. \n \n53. \nThe government and UPPCL have given certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government and \nUPPCL with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and \nproject agreement for the respective tranches. \n \n\nVII.
