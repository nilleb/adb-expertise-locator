THE PROPOSAL \n  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Chongqing Longxi River Basin Integrated Flood and \nEnvironmental Risk Management Project.  \n \n2.  The project will help the Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG) maintain environmental \nsustainability, leading to improved living conditions in the entire Longxi River watershed, a \nYangtze River sub-basin in the municipality. This will be achieved through the implementation of \nan integrated approach to manage flooding, the water environment, and ecology collectively with \na well-balanced mix of structural and nonstructural interventions, including capacity building. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and  two  specially \nadministered cities in the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for over 40% of the PRC\u2019s population \nand has 40% of the freshwater resources. It also serves as the drinking water resource for \n400 million people, provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland \narea, and contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. YREB has been earmarked as \none of the three key growth engines to ensure the PRC\u2019s future economic development.1 \n \n4.  YREB has benefitted from extensive development since 1990s, particularly in the delta \narea. Yet, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin is lagging \nand below its potential capacity. The middle and upper reaches of YREB still face significant \ndevelopment challenges because of (i) slow transformation for green development and economic \ndiversification; (ii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; (iii) increasing \npollution and pressure on natural resources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic \nplanning.2 YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic achievements and the quality of \nthe environment. \n \n5.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \ndevelopment plan 2016\u20132030,3 which stipulated the prioritization of ecological protection and \npromotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB development.4 In this \nconnection, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a \nframework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB during 2018\u20132020 to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB with priority \ngiven to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water \nresources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an \nintegrated multimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. \n \n6.  Since 1980, YREB has suffered over $0.3 trillion in direct economic damage from recurring \nfloods, accounting for 75% of the total flood damage in the PRC. Most flood damage does not \n                                                \n1  The other flagship projects are the Belt and Road Initiative and the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Integrated Regional \nDevelopment Strategy. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n4  Green development aims to (i) change the traditional development model to a sustainable development model; (ii) \naddress the challenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. ", "2 \ncome from the main stem river but from small to moderate-sized river sub-basins. YREB suffered \nfrom fatal floods in 2016 that caused $28 billion of economic damage, declaring emergencies at \nmore than 3,300 locations. Of those, over 3,200 were reported on small tributaries that generally \nhave lower standards of flood protection or where standards have not kept pace with the rapid \nrate of development or intensifying extreme rainfall events caused by global climatic changes. \nSince 1980, water pollution has risen by 73% mainly because of the direct discharge of domestic, \nindustrial, and agricultural waste, making water unfit for consumptive and productive use. The \nupper and middle reaches account for 80% of YREB\u2019s total wastewater discharge and the \ntributaries have the worst water quality in the river basin.5 The hydrological variability caused by \nrapid urbanization and industrialization has had a large contribution to water pollution and has \nincreased flood frequency and magnitude. The enormity of the losses suffered during 2000\u20132017 \nmerits a review of policies and practices in the PRC. Priority is yet to be given to improve water \ninterception, water quality, flood risk mitigation, and ecological protection in upstream areas, \nmainly sub-basins, to ensure the water flowing downstream is clean and free of flood risk. \n \n7.  Chongqing Municipality, the largest urban area in the upper YREB, plays a critical role in \nenvironmental and conservation efforts in the region.6 However, many rural towns and villages in \nChongqing are left behind from overall development because of insufficient public infrastructure, \ncontinued flood disasters, worsening water pollution, and degraded ecological conditions. The \ntraditional approach taken by CMG to flood control relies solely on structural measures, which are \nno  longer  feasible.  The  link  between  flood  management,  environmental  degradation,  and \necosystem sustainability needs to be addressed. An integrated approach is necessary to adapt \nto changing social, geophysical, and environmental conditions, leading to integrated flood and \nenvironmental risk management (FERM) as an approach to be adopted by the municipality. \n \n8.  Chongqing is a core part of the ecological conservation zone of the Three Gorges \nReservoir, which plays a pivotal role in mitigating floods in the middle and lower Yangtze River \nreaches. However, Chongqing has suffered from seven fatal floods since 2007. Longxi River \nwatershed is one of the worst flood-impacted areas, with only 10% of river reach protected by \nlevees for less than 5-year return period floods.7 The old concrete dams in Longxi River are no \nlonger beneficial as they are filled up with sediment and their operation is not compatible with \nemerging FERM needs. The annual average flood damage in Longxi River watershed is about \nCNY1.71 billion, with fatal flooding in 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017. \n \n9.  Chongqing produces 7% (1.5 billion tons) of household and 18% (355 million tons) of \nindustrial wastewater in YREB annually\u2014among the highest values per unit area in YREB. The \nannual average solid waste volume is more than 30 million tons in Chongqing, of which only 14% \nis  being  treated.  Inadequate  management  of  waste  has  resulted  in  poor  water  quality  in \nChongqing\u2019s rivers and lakes, which exceeds the national standard (class III) at various locations, \nspecifically  in  the  Longxi  River  watershed. 8  The  fast-paced  industrialization  (50%)  and \nurbanization (45%) rates along the Longxi River corridor, without proper planning, have put \npressure on water resources. The floods formed many belts of floating rubbish in the Longxi River, \nwhich exacerbated flooding and water pollution. Despite the availability of treatment facilities, over \n                                                \n5  YREB produces about 81% of the country\u2019s chemical fibers, 58% of pesticides, and 51% of fertilizers. Ministry of \nEcology and Environment. 2013. MEP Releases State of Environmental Quality of China in 2012.  \n6  Chongqing Municipality comprises 38 districts and counties over 82,400 square kilometers, and has a population of \n33.7 million of which over 39% is rural. \n7  Longxi River Basin in Chongqing Municipality has an area of 2,966 square kilometers (about 30 kilometers long) with \n2.1 million population. The river originates in Liangping District, passes through Dianjiang County, and merges with \nthe Yangtze River in Changshou District. The basin is located about 200 kilometers north of Chongqing City. \n8  Up to class III water is suitable for drinking as per PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002). \n ", "3 \n40% of residents and 80% of industries in the watershed do not benefit due to the lack of sewer \nnetwork.  Unsustainable  farming  resulted  in  high  sediment  yield  and  poor  water  operation \npractices have worsen the water quality in Shuanggui and Sanhe lakes (small lakes) in the \nwatershed. Water quality in Changshou Lake in the lower Longxi River watershed has also \ndeteriorated because of eutrophication.  \n \n10.  Wetlands account for 2.5% of the total area in Chongqing while green spaces make up \n4.3%\u2014the lowest in YREB. In the municipality, the Longxi River watershed suffers the most from \nhuman-induced ecological destruction. The hydrology and environment of the Longxi River \nwatershed are modified through long-term human activities, including agriculture and small water \ninfrastructure (e.g., barrages), which regulate river flows and habitat clearance. Since 1990, about \n60% of the wetlands and 35% of the vegetated areas in this watershed have disappeared and \nover 41% of the land area has been exposed to water-induced soil erosion, resulting in reduced \nriver conveyance, flooding, reservoir shrinkage, and water contamination. The climate change \nimpact in the watershed is likely to (i) worsen the water quality because of increased temperature \nand decreased river flow, and (ii) increase floods as a result of increased rainfall intensity. \n \n11.  Coordination among the upstream and downstream local governments in the Longxi River \nwatershed has not yet been established because of a lack of participatory watershed development \nplanning. The institutional capacity of local governments to implement FERM is still weak. To \nfacilitate sustainable development and enhance livelihoods, accommodate growing population, \nand attract investments, CMG will support local governments in development planning and \nimplementation. The integrated FERM plan and the implementation of critical measures are \nurgently required to promote sustainable development in the watershed, including infrastructure \ndevelopment, physical connectivity, and economic competitiveness. Since the watershed is in a \nless developed region, it can demonstrate environmentally sustainable growth model that can be \nreplicated in other manageable watersheds in Chongqing, YREB, or the entire PRC. \n \n12.  Strategic fit. In  January  2018, the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \nannounced the first batch of national priority river basin water environment and sustainable \ndevelopment pilot projects and identified the Longxi River Basin as one of 16 pilot river basins \nnationwide.9 The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission adopted the pilot program in \nthe form of the Longxi River basin development plan, 2018\u20132025, for which CMG considers this \nproject a kickoff and benchmark for investment in FERM. The project also aims to revitalize the \neco-compensation mechanism in the watershed by promoting upstream\u2013downstream links, and \nwill contribute to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious and prosperous society through \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. It is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \n2016\u20132020, which aims to realize \u201cecological civilization\u201d.10 The project is aligned with the ADB \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020,11 mainly  the  three  major  principles: \n(i) managing climate change and environment, (ii) supporting inclusive economic growth, and \n(iii) fostering knowledge cooperation. It is also consistent with (i) ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020, which emphasizes integrated water resources management (IWRM) with a focus on \nwater-related disaster risk management;12 and (ii) sustainable development goals 6, 11, and 13.13  \n                                                \n9  Government of the PRC. 2018.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The implementing agencies\u2019 domestic feasibility studies are technically sound, meet \ninternational standards, and provide sufficient information as to the design\u2019s feasibility. Licensed \ndomestic  design  institutes  prepared  all  project  components,  considering  local  geophysical, \nsocioeconomic, and hydro-metrological conditions, as well as anticipated climate change risks \n(rated medium\u2013high), in accordance with PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The \nproject (i) considered technical alternatives (e.g., conventional dike or ecological embankments, \nfixing dams to retain water or small barrages to regulate water, continuous or discontinuous dikes, \na stand-alone flash flood early warning system or centralized one) and their technical and \neconomic viability; (ii) deliberated ways to promote a flood footprint and accountability system in \nthe river basin, ensuring that the project will not just protect localities but also reduce 15.0%, \n12.0%, and 2.5% of 20-year flood peaks from Liangping to Dianjiang, Changshou, and ultimately \nthe Yangtze main river respectively; (iii) promoted the use of information and communication \ntechnology in IWRM; and (iv) optimized timescales for project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 23.2% and an economic net present value of CNY3,209 million. \nThe analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates \nof return of 11.1%\u201326.2%.25 Sensitivity analysis indicated that the project is robust to negative \nscenarios examined, such as an increase in investment costs, benefits reduction, and an increase \nin O&M cost. The full economic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as \nsome effects such as ecological benefits are not easily quantifiable. The financial analysis \nincluded  assessment  of  (i)  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  and  (ii)  the  financial \nmanagement capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. Financial sustainability was \nassessed based on the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funding for the project; and (ii) incremental \nrecurrent costs, including O&M expenditures. The implementing agencies\u2014Changshou District \nGovernment, Dianjiang County Government, and Liangping District Government\u2014substantially \ndepend on state government funding. The analysis confirmed the financial sustainability of the \nproject, with the fiscal impacts well within the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities. 26 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management risk  before  considering mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of the moderate inherent risk, low\u2013moderate control risk, and a relatively high \n                                                \n25 Detailed Economic Analysis (available on request). \n26 The counterpart funding commitment and incremental recurrent costs are less than 2% of the projected revenue for \nChangshou District, Dianjiang County, and Liangping District governments. \n ", "8 \nlevel of financial management capacities. CMG, given its experience with donor-funded projects, \nincluding ongoing ADB projects, will take overall responsibility for the financial management of \nthe project. CMG\u2019s sound financial management capacity is sufficient to support the implementing \nagencies for the financial management of the project. Measures to mitigate the identified financial \nmanagement  risks  are  in  the  financial  management  assessment.27 The  procurement risk \nassessment  confirmed that the  implementing  agencies,  which  will  conduct  all  procurement \nthrough a procurement agency, have adequate capacity to implement the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government, CMG, and implementing agencies. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Poverty and social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. A \ntotal of 0.895 million residents in 19 project towns, including 4,450 urban poor and 16,268 rural \npoor people, will directly benefit from the project through strengthened flood risk management \nand better environment and ecological protection in the Longxi River watershed. An additional \n1.909 million residents in the three project counties and districts will benefit indirectly from \nimproved flood management and environment. The project will create 2,337 jobs during project \nimplementation and 99 jobs during operation. A poverty and social analysis has been undertaken; \nand a social development action plan has been prepared. Key social design measures include (i) \navoiding or minimizing adverse social impacts; (ii) enhancing social benefits, including targeted \nemployment for women and the poor; and (iii) strengthening public participation and consultation \nduring project preparation and implementation. Several consultation meetings with local residents \nand stakeholders were undertaken during project preparation, and additional consultation and \nparticipation measures are in the social development action plan and other relevant plans.  \n \n28.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.28 It will benefit women, who \nconstitute 48.7% of the direct beneficiary population, by empowering them and improving their \nincome, living environment, and quality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared \nbased on gender analyses and local consultations to ensure gender mainstreaming under the \nproject. The key measures in the GAP include (i) fair and equitable participation of women in \ndecision making during project design and implementation, with at least 40% women participants; \n(ii) training and capacity building of staff of the executing and implementing agencies to implement \nthe GAP and related measures; (iii) priority employment opportunities for women, with at least \n30% during construction and 40% during operation; (iv) participation of women in awareness \nraising in flood and environmental management and public hearing on tariffs, with 50% women \nparticipants; (v) participation of women in decision making for the pilot community-based solid \nwaste management program, with at least 40% women members in community groups; and \n(vi) ensuring women employees\u2019 rights and equitable access to sanitation facilities and health \neducation (e.g., HIV/AIDS awareness) during construction. Key gender indicators have been \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n \n \n                                                \n27 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2012.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:29 \n \n30.  Environment (category A). An environmental impact assessment and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) have been prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 20 March 2018. A grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has \nbeen prepared and comprises steps with time-based actions to ensure that any public concerns \nare quickly identified and addressed. The GRM will be operational within 60 days from the date \nof loan effectiveness. The Chongqing provincial management office and project management \noffice environment and social officers will lead the implementation of the GRM. The procedures \nare described in the PAM and the EMP. \n \n31.  The project is expected to contribute significantly to municipal targets for environmental \nimprovement, including improved water quality; improved flood control, reduced siltation, and \navoided flood damage; and IWRM. Construction-related issues include the potential release of \ncontaminants  from  polluted  sediments  during  dredging  or  disposal,  as  well  as  short-term \nconstruction impacts such as dust and noise. Operational risks include altered hydrology and flow \nregime and inadequate O&M of the project facilities. The risk of indirect, cumulative, and/or \ninduced impacts was assessed. Mitigation measures are described in the EMP and include \nprocedures for the safe collection and disposal of the dredged sediments based on international \nbest practice, and green embankment designs to improve water retention and use native plantings. \nEffective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in residual impacts \nwithin the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n32.  The project will contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, by increasing the \nresilience of the flood defense and environmental protection infrastructure in accordance with \nanticipated climate impacts on the hydrological values and on the selection of materials and \nlocations, and by sequestering carbon through the revegetation components. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Of 4,193 mu of land area, 1,773 mu is existing \nstate-owned land; 1,585 mu of collective land will be obtained by land acquisition; 310 mu of land \nwill be arranged through rural infrastructure land use; and 525 mu will be used through land use \nright transfer.30 In addition, 527 mu of land will be temporarily used. A total of 32 households with \n123 persons will be relocated. A total of 5,412 households with 18,000 persons will be affected \nby the project\u2019s land use, mostly infrastructure along the riverbanks. Three resettlement plans \nhave been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant laws \nand regulations of the PRC. These include adequate measures of compensation, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation for affected people. Consultations were undertaken with affected people and \nlocal stakeholders during project preparation, and they will be further consulted during updating \nand implementation of the resettlement plans. GRMs have been established and incorporated \ninto the resettlement plans. The executing and implementing agencies will conduct internal \nmonitoring and will engage an external monitoring agency to monitor the implementation of \nresettlement plans and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category C). The project does not involve \nimpacts on ethnic minority villages or communities that would trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \n                                                \n29 ADB.

The scattered population of ethnic minority \nindividuals in the project area is not expected to have adverse impacts from the project. \n \n35.  Capacity for social and safeguard measures. The executing agency has experience in \nimplementing  various  projects,  including  several  ADB-financed  projects.  However,  the \nimplementing agencies do not have experience with ADB-financed projects. To implement social \nand safeguard measures properly, (i) executing agency and implementing agencies will each \nappoint focal social and safeguard staff, (ii) project implementation support consultants will \ninclude social and safeguard specialists, (iii) staff of executing agency and implementing agencies \nwill be provided with training on social and safeguard measures, and (iv) external monitoring \nexperts will be recruited for external monitoring of resettlement plans and other relevant plans. \n \nF.
