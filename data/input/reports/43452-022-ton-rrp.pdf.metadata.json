This capacity \nwill be provided as follows: (i) a total of 0.8 MWp on Eua, Vava\u2019u, and Ha\u2019apai; (ii) a total of 0.28 \nMWp on the four Ha\u2019apai outer islands of 'Uiha, Nomuka, Ha'ano, and Ha'afeva; (iii) 0.15 MWp \non Niuatoputapu; and (iv) 0.02 MWp on Niuafo\u2019ou. In addition to construction and installation of \nthe solar power systems, the project will hire project management consultants (PMCs) to draft \nthe final  designs  of  equipment,  support  the  bidding  process,  conduct  training  on the  operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  solar  equipment,  and  provide  efficient  project  implementation  and \nmanagement services for at least 5 years after the plants are commissioned.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nTonga  is  a  kingdom  of  176  islands  divided  into  five  island  groups\u2014Tongatapu,  'Eua, \n3. \nHa'apai, Vava'u, and Niuas. Its 102,000 people inhabit the permanent settlements that exist on \nabout  36  of  these  islands,  and  75%  live  on  Tongatapu,  the  main  island  and  location  of  the \ncapital, Nuku\u2019alofa. About 89% of all households have access to electricity\u2014out of them 97% in \nurban areas and 86% in the rural parts of the islands.   \n \n4. \nTonga  had  a  total  installed  grid  connected  power  capacity  in  2012  of  about  14.3 \nmegawatts  (MW).  Annual  demand  was  about  52.4  gigawatt-hours.  The  country  depends  on \nimported  diesel  to  produce  92%  of  its  electricity needs  and  consumed  an estimated  15  million \nliters for power generation in 2011. This represented about 10% of total gross domestic product \nand about 15% of total imports. About 98% of the total electricity supplied in Tonga during that \nyear was grid-connected and generated from diesel. The solar power capacity to be provided by \nthe project will save about 0.48 million liters of diesel per year.  \n \n5. \nThe  responsibility  for  provision  of  grid  connected  electricity  services  rests  solely  with \nTonga Power Limited (TPL). TPL is a government-owned, vertically integrated public enterprise \nunder  the  oversight  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  and  the  cabinet.  TPL  has  the \nconcession for and operates four independent grids for on-grid electricity services. These are on \nthe main island of Tongatapu, and main islands of the Vava\u2019u, Ha\u2019apai, and Eua island groups, \nwhere it generates, distributes, and retails electricity, and provides O&M services. \n \n6. \nThe energy planning unit (EPU) of the Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change, \nand  Natural  Resources  (MLECCNR)  is  the  primary  institutional  body  responsible  for  off-grid \nservices.  The  EPU  acts  under  the  policy  and  planning  guidance  provided  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and National Planning (MFNP) and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. In addition, the Ha\u2019apai \nand  Vava\u2019u  outer  island  groups  have  their  own  management  structures  for  off-grid  electricity \n                                                \n1   Through the Australian Agency for International Development. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB  2012.  Technical \nAssistance  to  Tonga  for  Preparing  the  Outer  Island  Renewable  Energy  Development  Project.  Manila  (TA  7940- \nTON, $500,000 approved on 2 December 2011, financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nprojects. On the four outer islands of the Ha\u2019apai group (Nomuka, \u2018Uhia, Ha\u2019ano, and Ha\u2019afeva), \nelectricity  cooperative  societies  (ECOs)  provide  day-to-day  operations,  maintenance,  and \nadministration  of  diesel  minigrids.  On  Niuafo\u2019ou,  a  management  committee  distributes  solar \nhome  systems  (SHSs).  On  Niuatoputapu,  some  households  have  privately  owned  SHSs  and \nsmall diesel generator sets to provide them with electricity.  \n \n7. \nThe  government  has  been  trying  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of  electricity  and  Tonga\u2019s \nextreme  economic  vulnerability  to  oil  price  increases,  a  great  part  of  which  is  due  to  the \nelectricity  sector\u2019s  high  dependence  on  imported  diesel.  Power  tariffs  are  inherently  high  in \nTonga because of the high costs of transporting imported diesel to the remote Pacific nation and \nbetween its scattered islands. In 2008, the government approved the Renewable Energy Act, a \nregulatory  instrument  to  promote  the  use  of  renewable  energy  technologies.  Under  its  2009 \nNational Strategic Planning Framework, it also created the 2010\u20132020 Tonga Energy Road Map \n(TERM)  for  the  general  development,  reform,  and  improvement  for  the  energy  sector.  TERM \naims to generate 50% of Tonga\u2019s grid-based electricity from renewable energy resources and to \nreduce the country\u2019s diesel consumption by 50% by 2020.3 \n \n8. \nBy following the recommendations of the TERM report, Tonga may be able to meet its \ntarget  of  reducing  diesel  consumption  by  2014\u20132015  through  the  latest  on-  and  off-grid \nrenewable energy project developments and by consumer demand-side management measures \nsuch as conserving energy, using electricity more efficiently, and reducing the power losses of \nTPL\u2019s electricity distribution network. TPL aims to reduce the electricity tariffs by 25% in 2014.  \n \n9. \nThe  electricity  tariff  in  TPL\u2019s  concessional  area  on  the  islands  of  Vava\u2019u,  \u2018Eua,  and \nHa\u2019apai was $0.52 per kilowatt hour (kWh) as of August 2012. The tariff has two parts: a base \nvariable energy rate, or nonfuel component, of $0.26; and a variable fuel surcharge component \nof $0.26. Under the concession contract, TPL can pass fuel costs on to consumers and charge \nan  inflation-indexed  nonfuel  tariff.  The  nonfuel  tariff  covers  operational  costs,  overhead \nexpenses,  interest  payments,  depreciation,  and an  allowed  return on  investment that  provides \nretained earnings for future capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments. \n \n10. \nOn the outer islands of Ha\u2019apai, the average monthly fee for electricity is about $0.53 per \nkWh. Niuatoputapu has no power grid and electricity is generated independently by households. \nOn  Niuafo\u2019ou,  an  electricity  management  committee  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  and \nreplacement  of  parts  of  about  167  SHSs.  On  the  Niua  group  the  monthly  average  fuel \ncomponent  for  kerosene  lanterns,  candles,  batteries,  and  electricity  for  lighting  purposes, \nincluding  the monthly  cost for  an  SHS,  has  been  conservatively  calculated  at  about  $0.74  per \nkWh.  This  estimate  excludes  administration,  asset  management,  and  O&M  expenses.  If  the \nnonfuel  component  was  included,  the  estimated  off-grid  supply  would  easily  exceed  $1  per \nkWh.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  Tonga\u2019s  heavy  reliance  on \nimported fossil fuels for power generation by providing secure, sustainable, clean electricity. By \noptimizing TPL and EPU systems, the project can exert downward pressure on tariffs for private \nand  commercial  consumers.  This  will  be  achieved  by  connecting  a  total  of  1.25  MWp  of \ndistributed solar photovoltaic generator capacity to existing distribution networks and providing \nPMCs to guarantee project sustainability over a period of five years by transferring knowledge to \nbeneficiaries  and  the  government\u2019s  implementing  unit  (as  described  in  paragraph  19  below), \n\n                                                \n3   Government  of  Tonga  2010.

For  the  rest  of  the  project  life  cycle,  TPL  and  the  private  sector  (TERM \nphase 2) are expected to provide management and O&M.  \n \n12. \nThe  project  due  diligence  has  examined  and  recommended  solar  energy  as  the  best \noption  with  less  environmental  impact  and  least  cost  approach  for  integrating  the  required \nrenewable  energy  facilities  into  the  grid  system.  It  has  also  demonstrated  that  lower  tariffs  (in \nthe case of TPL area of consession) and fees for electricty services (in case of the community \nbased  operation  areas  of  EPU)  are  possible  to  achieve  without  any  additional  subsidy.  While \nimproving  demand  and  supply  side  efficiency,  the  project  will  contribute  to  alleviating  poverty, \nsupplying sustainable and reliable electricity, and reducing diesel consumption.  \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  for \nTonga, which makes energy a priority area of support and sets a primary goal  of reducing the \ncountry\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuels  by  implementing  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation  measures,  including  power  generation  from  indigenous  renewable  energy \nsources.4 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe impact of the project will be the reduction of Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuel for power generation. The outcome of the project will be that on-grid and off-grid generation \nsystems are optimized and provide increased consumer access to electricity generated by solar \npower at a reduced cost. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \n\nThe outputs of the project are as follows: \n(i) \n\nSolar  power.  The  project  will  construct  and  install  solar  power  systems  with  a \ntotal  capacity  of  1.25  MWp on  9  outer  islands  of Tonga  by  (a)  connecting  solar \nphotovoltaic  generators  to  existing  electricity  distribution  networks  (0.2  MWp  on \nEua,  0.4  MWp  on  Vava\u2019u,  and  0.2  MWp  on  Ha\u2019apai);  (b)  connecting  solar \nphotovoltaic  generators  to  existing  community-owned  and  community-managed \nelectrical  minigrids  on  four  Ha\u2019apai  outer  islands  (70  kilowatt-peak  (kWp)  on \n'Uiha,  70  kWp  on  Nomuka,  70  kWp  on  Ha'ano,  and  70  kWp  on  Ha'afeva);  (c)  \nconnecting  0.15  MWp  of  solar  power  capacity  to  a  newly  installed  distribution \nsystem in Niuatoputapu; and (d) expanding existing solar home system capacity \nin Niuafo\u2019ou by installing an additional 100 units of 200 watt peak SHSs.  \nOperation and maintenance knowledge transfer training.

The executing agency will be the MFNP. \n\n                                                \n5  Finance will include all goods, works, associated services for erecting, commissioning, start-up and trial period of \nthe solar photovoltaic equipment of the project; and for the project management consultants and all sea, air, and \nland transportation (national and international), including cost insurance and freight to project site and warehouse.  \n6  A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Tonga  had  a  high  risk  of  debt  distress  and  was  therefore \neligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nThe implementing agencies will be the TERM Agency 7 and TPL. The Tonga Energy Road Map \nImplementation Unit (TERM-IU) within the TERM Agency will oversee the implementation of the \nproject. The government has made the TERM-IU the energy sector cross-cutting implementing \nentity.  TPL  has  hands-on  expertise  important  to  the  project  due  to  its  power  engineering \nknowledge  and  includes  the  project  management  unit.  Such  project  activities  as  the  final \ntechnical  design  and  bidding  process  will  be  conducted  by  TPL,  assisted  and  supervised  by \nADB.  Social  and  environmental  safeguards  will  be  conducted  by  TPL,  assisted  by  PMCs  and \nperiodically reviewed by ADB. A contractor will undertake the construction, assisted by TPL and \nthe  PMCs,  and  periodically  reviewed  by  ADB.  O&M  will  be  conducted  by  TPL  and  the  PMCs. \nThe  government,  through  TPL,  will  own  the  project  assets,  with  all  benefits  being  made \navailable  by  means  of  a  transparent  and  auditable  costing  and  pricing  methodology.  The \nimplementing  agencies,  assisted  by  the  EPU  of  the  MLECCNR,  and  the  PMCs  will  be \nresponsible for the final engineering designs, supervised by ADB.8  \n \n19. \nTo ensure that the project effectively assists all stakeholders and beneficiaries, ADB will \nrecruit  the  international  team  of  PMCs  to  help  all  parties  understand  O&M  procedures  for  on- \nand off-grid solar power plants for 5 years after plant commissioning. TPL will be assisted by the \nPMCs  during  detailed  engineering.  The  project  component  will  allow  TPL  to  acquire  key \nknowledge and further develop its own solar power O&M capacity. A project steering committee \nchaired by the MFNP and composed of the MLECCNR, the EPU, Ministry of Public Enterprises, \nTPL,  and  the  TERM-IU  will  oversee  the  project,  support  sustainability,  and  ensure  effective \nassistance to all project stakeholders and beneficiaries.

The equipment has \nbeen carefully analyzed, based on best engineering practices and trends in the solar industry. It \nis  designed  in  line  with  quality  standards  specifically  conceived  for  hard  marine  environments \nand  remote  island  conditions.  In  the  case  of  power  plants  connected  to  TPL  grids,  the  design \ncalls  for  the  project  to  provide  complete  preassembled  solar  photovoltaic  generators;  middle \nvoltage  switch  gear  and  control  equipment;  and,  in  the  case  of  the  outer  islands,  compact, \nmaintenance-free  (up  to  90%)  photovoltaic  solutions.  All  equipment  has  been  designed  with \nremote control, monitoring, and protection systems standard in the solar industry. This will save \nup  to  80%  of  the  usual  O&M  costs  and  requirements  for  technical  personnel.  The  PMCs  will \nprovide specialized O&M and knowledge transfer to executing and implementing partners, with \na particular focus on the integration of other power projects and ensuring sustainable operation. \n \n21. \nThe  capacity  of  the  project\u2019s  new  solar  systems  is  small  enough  to  be  smoothly \nintegrated  into  the  existing  diesel-powered  networks,  particularly  in  Ha\u2019apai  and  \u2018Eua.  On \nVava\u2019u, the ADB project\u2019s 400 kWp new solar plant will operate together with the 500 kWp solar \nplant  being  financed  by  the  United  Arab  Emirates  as  one  unit.  The  combined  900  kWp  solar \npower  installation  will  supply  about  30%  of  the  peak  load in  Vava\u2019u.  The  technical  designs for \nboth  plants  include  battery  storage to  allow  the  solar  power  capacity  to  be  balanced  with  and \nintegrated into the existing network, absorb solar intermittence during the day, and store energy \nto partially  supply  peak  loads during  early  night.  This  will  create  a sustainable,  stable,  reliable \nelectricity  system.  The  size  of  the  project  plant\u2019s  battery  bank  is  economically  and  financially \nsound and will not create an excess of energy. It will also allow the decommissioning up to four \nof six existing diesel generators on the network. It will also enable the remaining diesel units to \nperform at their optimum fuel consumed\u2014electricity generated ratio, contributing to the utility\u2019s \nleast cost development.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nAll financial costs and benefits have been expressed in January 2013 prices. The project \nfinancial analysis quantifies costs and benefits of the project for the implementing agency of the \nproject  and  for  the  investment  project  as  a  whole.  Project  financial  costs  include  (i)  the  initial \ncosts of the hardware and electrical works needed for the installation and integration of the solar \npower  plant  with  the  existing  electrical  grid;  (ii)  annual  and  periodic  O&M  expenditures, \nexcluding for those needed replacement parts; and (iii) consulting services required for design, \ntendering, training, and project supervision. The financial costs exclude the price contingencies.  \n \n23. \nA  financial  appraisal  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios  over  a  20-year  operational  period,  with  the  residual  value  at  the  end  of  this  period \nassumed  as  zero.  In  the  interest  of  a  conservative  analysis,  no  tariff  increase  was  assumed. \nThe  project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  estimated  to  be  9.46%.  This  compares \nfavorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  0.76%,  indicating  that  the \nproject is financially viable. The sensitivity tests showed robust results for all scenarios, with the \nresulting FIRRs exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 0.76%. Sensitivity analyses \nwere undertaken on the financial and economic results to examine the impacts of the following \nchanges to key assumptions and project risks: (i) an implementation delay of 1 year, (ii) a 10% \nreduction  in  solar  power  generation,  (iii)  a  15%  reduction  in  solar  power  generation,  (iv)  an \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nincrease in replacement costs of 10%, (v) a drop in diesel prices by 10%, (vi) a 10% increase in \ndiesel  prices,  and  (vii)  a  combination  of  a  15%  reduction  in  generation  and  increase  in \nreplacement  costs  of  10%.  The  project  remains  financially  viable  under  these  scenarios,  with \nFIRRs of 7.62%\u20139.46%.10 \n \n24. \n The  average  levelized  cost  of  electricity  (LCOE)  was  calculated  for  the  solar \nphotovoltaic assets in the nine outer islands and is estimated to be $0.27/kWh. The LCOE was \ncalculated within a conservative scenario to highlight the benefit of the project. The components \nof the LCOE are (i) depreciation on a straight-line basis to permit TPL and EPU to replace the \nentire power plant after 20 years of asset life; (ii) O&M expenses for O&M staff and sundry items \nrequired  for  the  successful  operation  of  the  plant;  (iii)  a  sinking  fund  for  replacement \ncomponents,  which  should  contribute  to  replacing  the  major  parts  during  the  life  of  the  plant; \nand (iv) a residual value of the plant after the project equal to zero. \n \n25.  \n Table  4  shows  the  with-  and  without-project  tariff  comparison  for  the  TPL  concession \narea and with- and without-project monthly fee for electricity services for the areas not regulated \nby the government. It demonstrates the pro-poor nature of this project.  \n \n\nTable 4: Cost of Electricity With and Without the Project \n($/kWh) \n\nLCOE  \n(With Project) \n0.27 \n0.27 \n0.27 \n\nCurrent TPL Tariff \n(Without Project) \n0.52 \n0.53 \n0.74 \n\nPayment Type \n\nFee for electricity \nServices \n\nDifference \n0.25 \n0.26 \n0.47 \n\nIsland \nVava'u, 'Eua, and Ha'apai  Tariff \nOuter Ha'apai islands \nNiuas \nkWh = kilowatt-hour, LCOE = levelized cost of electricity, TPL = Tonga Power Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nEconomic analysis was undertaken for the solar photovoltaic projects by comparing the \n26. \ndiscounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project scenarios during 2014\u20132034 \nin  constant  2013  prices.  The  without-project  case  represents  a  continuation  of  the  existing \nsituation,  and the  with-project  case  represents  the  project  investment  scenario.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 17.24%. The EIRR compares favorably with the \n12% economic opportunity cost of capital, and the estimated weighted average cost of capital at \n0.76%, indicating that the project is economically viable. Under several scenarios considered in \nthe sensitivity analysis, the EIRR remains robust, with EIRRs of 13.86%\u201317.24%.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nMFNP,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  approve  withdrawal  applications  coming from  the  project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy services. The MFNP will be assisted in this process by the PMCs. A public financial \nmanagement  performance  assessment  conducted  in  2010  concluded  that  Tonga\u2019s  public \nfinancial  management  system  is  based  on  a  solid  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and \nunderpinned  by  a  set  of  well-established  expenditure  control  procedures  covering  wages  and \nsalaries, non-salary items, and procurement.11  \n\n                                                \n10  ADB.  2007.

Nuku\u2019alofa.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nProcurement.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  help  in  all  processes  for \n28. \nprocuring  all  project  goods,  works,  and  services,  and  to  recruit  PMCs  services  to  provide  the \nrelated support. A procurement capacity assessment of TPL indicates that Tonga\u2019s procurement \nregulations  and  procedures  are  comprehensive,  and  that  TPL  has  a  functioning  procurement \nunit,  although  the  unit\u2019s  experience  in  and  qualifications  for  procuring  solar  equipment  are \nlimited. Procurement of goods, works, and related services under the project will be processed \nthrough  TPL,  with  oversight  by  ADB,  and  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  prepare  technical  specifications, \nbidding  documents  (according  to  its  own  format),  and  bidding  evaluation  forms  for  project \nprocurement.  TPL  will  conduct  the  bidding  process.  ADB  will  recruit  the  PMCs  through  fixed \nbudget selection due to the complexity of the technological endeavor. Consultancy services will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n29. \nAdvance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  borrower,  implementing  and  executing  agencies  have  been  advised  that \napproval of advanced contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. Minor goods and \nservices costing under the equivalent of $100,000 will be procured by the implementing agency \nthrough  shopping  procedures  and  the  direct  payment  method.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and  MFNP. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nThe  social  survey  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  TA  in  April  and  July  2012 \nshowed  that  communities  in  the  outer  islands  identify  lack  of  employment  and  other  income-\nearning  opportunities  as  the  main  cause  of  hardship.  Other  causes  cited  included  too  many \ndependents,  landlessness,  the  burden of family,  community  obligations, poor  health,  and  poor \nfamily  budgeting. The groups most  vulnerable to  hardship  include children,  youth,  women, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. The project will address hardship by reducing the monthly expenses \nfor electricity services. In addition, in the case of Ha\u2019apai outer islands and Niuas, the project will \ncontribute to promote development of local craft manufacturing and sustainable tourism, which \nwill benefit the poor. \n \n31. \nThe  project  is  classified as effective gender  mainstreaming,  with the majority  of  project \noutputs having specific gender design features to ensure  that women participate in the project \nand have access to project benefits. The survey showed that the significant concerns of women \ninclude  (i)  affordability  of  urban  services,  (ii)  improving  power  usage  (conservation),  (iii) \nimproving  the  health  and  well-being  of  households  and  the  community,  (iv)  having  greater \naccess to information on urban services and urban planning, (v) having greater involvement in \ndeveloping  solutions  for  communities  through  women\u2019s  committee  support,  and  (vi)  being \ninvolved in consultation and decision making. The project gender action plan will address these \nconcerns  and  ensure  that  any  potential  harmful  effects  on  women  are  avoided.  The  gender \naction plan includes specific actions that will benefit women.  \n \n32. \nKey  gender  aspects  have  been  assessed  through  gender  analysis  and  community \nconsultations.  It  was  found  that  the  project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  women.  The \nproject  will  include  the  engagement  of  women  in  consultation  activities;  provision  of  gender \nawareness  to  target  groups,  including  participation  in  income-generating  activities;  actions  to \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nencourage  women  to  participate  in  project-related  contracts;  and  collection  of  gender-related \ndata for monitoring purposes.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  classified  as  environmental  category  B. \n\n33. \nInitial \nenvironmental  examinations  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  No  significant  environmental  impacts  will  result  from  the  implementation  of \nthe proposed project. \n \nClimate  change. A climate risk profile for Tonga prepared by ADB in 2008 12 indicates \n34. \nthat the main impacts of climate change are expected to be high sea levels, extreme winds, and \nextremely  high  air  and  water  temperatures.  The  best  estimates  of  long-term,  systematic \nchanges in the average climate for Tonga indicate that by 2050 the sea level is likely to rise by \n36  centimeters;  and  the  frequency  of  severe,  short  sea  level  rise  resulting  from  storm  surge \n(2.2 meters  above  mean  sea  level)  will  increase  from  a  1-in-580-year  event  to  a  1-in-5-year \nevent.  The  project  will  provide  solar  photovoltaic  plants  that  are  compact,  preassembled,  and \nresistant to marine environments, and thereby resilient to climate change. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The project is not expected to involve land acquisition or restrictions on land use or \naccess  to  designated  parks  or  protected  areas.  The  project  facilities  will  be  constructed  in \nexisting locations or on land owned by the government, TPL, or the individual owners of project \nfacilities. No third party or persons will be adversely affected. \n \n36. \nThe  project  is  not  expected  to  impact  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous \npeoples,  as  defined under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. The  beneficiaries  in  the  project \nsites are part of mainstream Polynesian society and are not considered to be distinct from the \nmainstream  society.  They  are  not  discriminated  against  due  to  their  language,  skin  color,  or \neducation  level  and  do  not  require  protection  or  special  attention  from  the  project.  All  project \noutputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate, participatory manner. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 13  Mitigation  measures  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n\n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nThe project could face a capital cost overrun. \n\nImplementation  could  be  delayed,  leading  to \ncost overruns \n\nMitigating Measures \nAdequate  contingencies  have  been  provided.
