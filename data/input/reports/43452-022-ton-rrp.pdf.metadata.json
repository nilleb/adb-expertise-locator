I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia1 \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will construct and install solar power systems with an overall \ndistributed capacity of 1.25 megawatt-peak (MWp) on nine outer islands in Tonga. This capacity \nwill be provided as follows: (i) a total of 0.8 MWp on Eua, Vava\u2019u, and Ha\u2019apai; (ii) a total of 0.28 \nMWp on the four Ha\u2019apai outer islands of 'Uiha, Nomuka, Ha'ano, and Ha'afeva; (iii) 0.15 MWp \non Niuatoputapu; and (iv) 0.02 MWp on Niuafo\u2019ou. In addition to construction and installation of \nthe solar power systems, the project will hire project management consultants (PMCs) to draft \nthe final designs of equipment, support the bidding process, conduct training on the operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of solar equipment, and provide efficient project implementation and \nmanagement services for at least 5 years after the plants are commissioned.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT   \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga is a kingdom of 176 islands divided into five island groups\u2014Tongatapu, 'Eua, \nHa'apai, Vava'u, and Niuas. Its 102,000 people inhabit the permanent settlements that exist on \nabout 36 of these islands, and 75% live on Tongatapu, the main island and location of the \ncapital, Nuku\u2019alofa. About 89% of all households have access to electricity\u2014out of them 97% in \nurban areas and 86% in the rural parts of the islands.   \n \n4.  Tonga  had  a  total  installed  grid  connected  power  capacity  in  2012  of  about  14.3 \nmegawatts (MW). Annual demand was about 52.4 gigawatt-hours. The country depends on \nimported diesel to produce 92% of its electricity needs and consumed an estimated 15 million \nliters for power generation in 2011. This represented about 10% of total gross domestic product \nand about 15% of total imports. About 98% of the total electricity supplied in Tonga during that \nyear was grid-connected and generated from diesel. The solar power capacity to be provided by \nthe project will save about 0.48 million liters of diesel per year.  \n \n5.  The responsibility for provision of grid connected electricity services rests solely with \nTonga Power Limited (TPL). TPL is a government-owned, vertically integrated public enterprise \nunder  the  oversight  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  and  the  cabinet.  TPL  has  the \nconcession for and operates four independent grids for on-grid electricity services. These are on \nthe main island of Tongatapu, and main islands of the Vava\u2019u, Ha\u2019apai, and Eua island groups, \nwhere it generates, distributes, and retails electricity, and provides O&M services. \n \n6.  The energy planning unit (EPU) of the Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change, \nand Natural Resources (MLECCNR) is the primary institutional body responsible for off-grid \nservices. The EPU acts under the policy and planning guidance provided by the Ministry of \nFinance and National Planning (MFNP) and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. In addition, the Ha\u2019apai \nand Vava\u2019u outer island groups have their own management structures for off-grid electricity \n                                                \n1  Through the Australian Agency for International Development. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB 2012. Technical \nAssistance to Tonga for Preparing the Outer Island Renewable Energy Development Project. Manila (TA 7940- \nTON, $500,000 approved on 2 December 2011, financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n ", "2 \n \nprojects. On the four outer islands of the Ha\u2019apai group (Nomuka, \u2018Uhia, Ha\u2019ano, and Ha\u2019afeva), \nelectricity  cooperative  societies  (ECOs)  provide  day-to-day  operations,  maintenance,  and \nadministration of diesel minigrids. On Niuafo\u2019ou, a management committee distributes solar \nhome systems (SHSs). On Niuatoputapu, some households have privately owned SHSs and \nsmall diesel generator sets to provide them with electricity.  \n \n7.  The government has been trying to reduce the high cost of electricity and Tonga\u2019s \nextreme  economic  vulnerability  to  oil  price  increases,  a great  part  of  which  is  due  to  the \nelectricity sector\u2019s high dependence on imported diesel. Power tariffs are inherently high in \nTonga because of the high costs of transporting imported diesel to the remote Pacific nation and \nbetween its scattered islands. In 2008, the government approved the Renewable Energy Act, a \nregulatory instrument to promote the use of renewable energy technologies. Under its 2009 \nNational Strategic Planning Framework, it also created the 2010\u20132020 Tonga Energy Road Map \n(TERM) for the general development, reform, and improvement for the energy sector. TERM \naims to generate 50% of Tonga\u2019s grid-based electricity from renewable energy resources and to \nreduce the country\u2019s diesel consumption by 50% by 2020.3 \n \n8.  By following the recommendations of the TERM report, Tonga may be able to meet its \ntarget  of  reducing  diesel  consumption  by  2014\u20132015  through  the  latest  on-  and  off-grid \nrenewable energy project developments and by consumer demand-side management measures \nsuch as conserving energy, using electricity more efficiently, and reducing the power losses of \nTPL\u2019s electricity distribution network. TPL aims to reduce the electricity tariffs by 25% in 2014.  \n \n9.  The electricity tariff in TPL\u2019s concessional area on the islands of Vava\u2019u, \u2018Eua, and \nHa\u2019apai was $0.52 per kilowatt hour (kWh) as of August 2012. The tariff has two parts: a base \nvariable energy rate, or nonfuel component, of $0.26; and a variable fuel surcharge component \nof $0.26. Under the concession contract, TPL can pass fuel costs on to consumers and charge \nan  inflation-indexed  nonfuel  tariff.  The  nonfuel  tariff  covers  operational  costs,  overhead \nexpenses, interest payments, depreciation, and an allowed return on investment that provides \nretained earnings for future capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments. \n \n10.  On the outer islands of Ha\u2019apai, the average monthly fee for electricity is about $0.53 per \nkWh. Niuatoputapu has no power grid and electricity is generated independently by households. \nOn  Niuafo\u2019ou,  an  electricity  management  committee  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  and \nreplacement  of  parts  of  about  167  SHSs.  On  the  Niua  group  the  monthly  average  fuel \ncomponent  for  kerosene  lanterns,  candles,  batteries,  and  electricity  for  lighting  purposes, \nincluding the monthly cost for an SHS, has been conservatively calculated at about $0.74 per \nkWh. This estimate excludes administration, asset management, and O&M expenses. If the \nnonfuel component was included, the estimated off-grid supply would easily exceed $1 per \nkWh.  \n \n11.  The project will support the government\u2019s efforts to reduce Tonga\u2019s heavy reliance on \nimported fossil fuels for power generation by providing secure, sustainable, clean electricity. By \noptimizing TPL and EPU systems, the project can exert downward pressure on tariffs for private \nand  commercial  consumers.  This  will  be  achieved  by  connecting  a  total  of  1.25  MWp  of \ndistributed solar photovoltaic generator capacity to existing distribution networks and providing \nPMCs to guarantee project sustainability over a period of five years by transferring knowledge to \nbeneficiaries and the government\u2019s implementing unit (as described in paragraph 19 below), \n                                                \n3  Government of Tonga 2010.

For the rest of the project life cycle, TPL and the private sector (TERM \nphase 2) are expected to provide management and O&M.  \n \n12.  The project due diligence has examined and recommended solar energy as the best \noption with less environmental impact and least cost approach for integrating the required \nrenewable energy facilities into the grid system. It has also demonstrated that lower tariffs (in \nthe case of TPL area of consession) and fees for electricty services (in case of the community \nbased operation areas of EPU) are possible to achieve without any additional subsidy. While \nimproving demand and supply side efficiency, the project will contribute to alleviating poverty, \nsupplying sustainable and reliable electricity, and reducing diesel consumption.  \n \n13.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  for \nTonga, which makes energy a priority area of support and sets a primary goal of reducing the \ncountry\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuels  by  implementing  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation  measures,  including  power  generation  from  indigenous  renewable  energy \nsources.4 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project will be the reduction of Tonga\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuel for power generation. The outcome of the project will be that on-grid and off-grid generation \nsystems are optimized and provide increased consumer access to electricity generated by solar \npower at a reduced cost. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The outputs of the project are as follows: \n(i)  Solar power. The project will construct and install solar power systems with a \ntotal capacity of 1.25 MWp on 9 outer islands of Tonga by (a) connecting solar \nphotovoltaic generators to existing electricity distribution networks (0.2 MWp on \nEua,  0.4  MWp  on  Vava\u2019u,  and  0.2  MWp  on  Ha\u2019apai);  (b)  connecting  solar \nphotovoltaic generators to existing community-owned and community-managed \nelectrical minigrids  on four Ha\u2019apai outer islands (70 kilowatt-peak (kWp) on \n'Uiha, 70 kWp on Nomuka, 70 kWp on Ha'ano, and 70 kWp on Ha'afeva); (c)  \nconnecting 0.15 MWp of solar power capacity to a newly installed distribution \nsystem in Niuatoputapu; and (d) expanding existing solar home system capacity \nin Niuafo\u2019ou by installing an additional 100 units of 200 watt peak SHSs.  \n(ii)  Operation and maintenance knowledge transfer training. Capacity building of \nTPL,  TERM-IU,  ECOS,  EMS  and  EPU  through  the  provision  of  the  project \nmanagement services by the PMC for at least 5 years following completion of the \nProject training and transfer of knowledge on asset management and operations \nand maintenance of solar generation and distribution systems; and preparation of \nan operations and maintenance program manual for the Project and provision of \noperations and maintenance services for Project facilities. \n(iii)  Efficient and effective project implementation and management. Capacity \nbuilding  of  TPL,  TERM-IU,  ECOS,  EMS,  and  EPU  through  the  provision  of \nproject  management  services  by  the  PMC  for  at  least  5  years  following \ncompletion of the Project.  \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012.

The government has requested grants totaling $6.50 million to finance project goods, \nworks,  and  services.5 The  grants  comprise  a  $2  million  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources6 and a $4.5 million grant from the Government of Australia, administered by ADB to \nhelp finance the project. The government will provide the equivalent of $0.3 million as in-kind \ncontribution  toward  land-related  and  administrative  costs.  The  government  will  make  the \nproceeds of the grants available to TPL under a subsidiary grant agreement upon terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB.

In addition, the 1% fee based on the \ncapital cost of the project, and defined under the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation 2010 will be waived \nas well. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The government will be the grant beneficiary. The executing agency will be the MFNP. \n                                                \n5  Finance will include all goods, works, associated services for erecting, commissioning, start-up and trial period of \nthe solar photovoltaic equipment of the project; and for the project management consultants and all sea, air, and \nland transportation (national and international), including cost insurance and freight to project site and warehouse.  \n6  A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Tonga had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore \neligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. ", "5 \n \nThe implementing agencies will be the TERM Agency 7 and TPL. The Tonga Energy Road Map \nImplementation Unit (TERM-IU) within the TERM Agency will oversee the implementation of the \nproject. The government has made the TERM-IU the energy sector cross-cutting implementing \nentity.  TPL  has  hands-on  expertise  important  to  the  project  due  to  its  power  engineering \nknowledge  and  includes  the  project  management  unit.  Such  project  activities  as  the  final \ntechnical design and bidding process will be conducted by TPL, assisted and supervised by \nADB. Social and environmental safeguards will be conducted by TPL, assisted by PMCs and \nperiodically reviewed by ADB. A contractor will undertake the construction, assisted by TPL and \nthe PMCs, and periodically reviewed by ADB. O&M will be conducted by TPL and the PMCs. \nThe  government,  through  TPL,  will  own  the  project  assets,  with  all  benefits  being  made \navailable  by  means  of  a  transparent  and  auditable  costing  and  pricing  methodology.  The \nimplementing  agencies,  assisted  by  the  EPU  of  the  MLECCNR,  and  the  PMCs  will  be \nresponsible for the final engineering designs, supervised by ADB.8  \n \n19.  To ensure that the project effectively assists all stakeholders and beneficiaries, ADB will \nrecruit the international team of PMCs to help all parties understand O&M procedures for on- \nand off-grid solar power plants for 5 years after plant commissioning. TPL will be assisted by the \nPMCs  during  detailed  engineering.  The  project  component  will  allow  TPL  to  acquire  key \nknowledge and further develop its own solar power O&M capacity. A project steering committee \nchaired by the MFNP and composed of the MLECCNR, the EPU, Ministry of Public Enterprises, \nTPL, and the TERM-IU will oversee the project, support sustainability, and ensure effective \nassistance to all project stakeholders and beneficiaries.

The project has been assessed as technically viable, based on extensive study of the \nload and energy demand records provided by TPL and field investigations. The equipment has \nbeen carefully analyzed, based on best engineering practices and trends in the solar industry. It \nis designed in line with quality standards specifically conceived for hard marine environments \nand remote island conditions. In the case of power plants connected to TPL grids, the design \ncalls for the project to provide complete preassembled solar photovoltaic generators; middle \nvoltage switch gear and control equipment; and, in the case of the outer islands, compact, \nmaintenance-free (up to 90%) photovoltaic solutions. All equipment has been designed with \nremote control, monitoring, and protection systems standard in the solar industry. This will save \nup to 80% of the usual O&M costs and requirements for technical personnel. The PMCs will \nprovide specialized O&M and knowledge transfer to executing and implementing partners, with \na particular focus on the integration of other power projects and ensuring sustainable operation. \n \n21.  The  capacity  of  the  project\u2019s  new  solar  systems  is  small  enough  to  be  smoothly \nintegrated  into  the  existing  diesel-powered  networks,  particularly  in  Ha\u2019apai  and  \u2018Eua.  On \nVava\u2019u, the ADB project\u2019s 400 kWp new solar plant will operate together with the 500 kWp solar \nplant being financed by the United Arab Emirates as one unit. The combined 900 kWp solar \npower installation will supply about 30% of the peak load in Vava\u2019u. The technical designs for \nboth plants include battery storage to allow the solar power capacity to be balanced with and \nintegrated into the existing network, absorb solar intermittence during the day, and store energy \nto partially supply peak loads during early night. This will create a sustainable, stable, reliable \nelectricity system. The size of the project plant\u2019s battery bank is economically and financially \nsound and will not create an excess of energy. It will also allow the decommissioning up to four \nof six existing diesel generators on the network. It will also enable the remaining diesel units to \nperform at their optimum fuel consumed\u2014electricity generated ratio, contributing to the utility\u2019s \nleast cost development.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  All financial costs and benefits have been expressed in January 2013 prices. The project \nfinancial analysis quantifies costs and benefits of the project for the implementing agency of the \nproject and for the investment project as a whole. Project financial costs include (i) the initial \ncosts of the hardware and electrical works needed for the installation and integration of the solar \npower  plant  with  the  existing  electrical  grid;  (ii)  annual  and  periodic  O&M  expenditures, \nexcluding for those needed replacement parts; and (iii) consulting services required for design, \ntendering, training, and project supervision. The financial costs exclude the price contingencies.  \n \n23.  A  financial  appraisal  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios over a 20-year operational period, with the residual value at the end of this period \nassumed as zero. In the interest of a conservative analysis, no tariff increase was assumed. \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is estimated to be 9.46%. This compares \nfavorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital at 0.76%, indicating that the \nproject is financially viable. The sensitivity tests showed robust results for all scenarios, with the \nresulting FIRRs exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 0.76%. Sensitivity analyses \nwere undertaken on the financial and economic results to examine the impacts of the following \nchanges to key assumptions and project risks: (i) an implementation delay of 1 year, (ii) a 10% \nreduction in solar power generation, (iii) a 15% reduction in solar power generation, (iv) an ", "7 \n \nincrease in replacement costs of 10%, (v) a drop in diesel prices by 10%, (vi) a 10% increase in \ndiesel  prices,  and  (vii)  a  combination  of  a  15%  reduction  in  generation  and  increase  in \nreplacement costs of 10%. The project remains financially viable under these scenarios, with \nFIRRs of 7.62%\u20139.46%.10 \n \n24.   The  average  levelized  cost  of  electricity  (LCOE)  was  calculated  for  the  solar \nphotovoltaic assets in the nine outer islands and is estimated to be $0.27/kWh. The LCOE was \ncalculated within a conservative scenario to highlight the benefit of the project. The components \nof the LCOE are (i) depreciation on a straight-line basis to permit TPL and EPU to replace the \nentire power plant after 20 years of asset life; (ii) O&M expenses for O&M staff and sundry items \nrequired  for  the  successful  operation  of  the  plant;  (iii)  a  sinking  fund  for  replacement \ncomponents, which should contribute to replacing the major parts during the life of the plant; \nand (iv) a residual value of the plant after the project equal to zero. \n \n25.    Table 4 shows the with- and without-project tariff comparison for the TPL concession \narea and with- and without-project monthly fee for electricity services for the areas not regulated \nby the government. It demonstrates the pro-poor nature of this project.  \n \nTable 4: Cost of Electricity With and Without the Project \n($/kWh) \nCurrent TPL Tariff  LCOE  \nIsland  Payment Type  (Without Project)  (With Project)  Difference \nVava'u, 'Eua, and Ha'apai  Tariff  0.52  0.27  0.25 \nOuter Ha'apai islands  Fee for electricity  0.53  0.27  0.26 \nNiuas  Services  0.74  0.27  0.47 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour, LCOE = levelized cost of electricity, TPL = Tonga Power Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the solar photovoltaic projects by comparing the \ndiscounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project scenarios during 2014\u20132034 \nin constant 2013 prices. The without-project case represents a continuation of the existing \nsituation, and the with-project case represents the project investment scenario. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be 17.24%. The EIRR compares favorably with the \n12% economic opportunity cost of capital, and the estimated weighted average cost of capital at \n0.76%, indicating that the project is economically viable. Under several scenarios considered in \nthe sensitivity analysis, the EIRR remains robust, with EIRRs of 13.86%\u201317.24%.   \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nMFNP, as the executing agency, will approve withdrawal applications coming from the project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy services. The MFNP will be assisted in this process by the PMCs. A public financial \nmanagement  performance  assessment  conducted  in  2010  concluded  that  Tonga\u2019s  public \nfinancial  management  system  is  based  on  a  solid  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and \nunderpinned by a set of well-established expenditure control procedures covering wages and \nsalaries, non-salary items, and procurement.11  \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2007.

Procurement.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  help  in  all  processes  for \nprocuring all project goods, works, and services, and to recruit PMCs services to provide the \nrelated support. A procurement capacity assessment of TPL indicates that Tonga\u2019s procurement \nregulations and procedures are comprehensive, and that TPL has a functioning procurement \nunit, although the unit\u2019s experience in and qualifications for procuring solar equipment are \nlimited. Procurement of goods, works, and related services under the project will be processed \nthrough TPL, with oversight by ADB, and carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will prepare technical specifications, \nbidding documents (according to its own format), and bidding evaluation forms for project \nprocurement. TPL will conduct the bidding process. ADB will recruit the PMCs through fixed \nbudget selection due to the complexity of the technological endeavor. Consultancy services will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n29.  Advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  borrower,  implementing  and  executing  agencies  have  been  advised  that \napproval of advanced contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. Minor goods and \nservices costing under the equivalent of $100,000 will be procured by the implementing agency \nthrough shopping  procedures  and the  direct  payment  method.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MFNP. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project \nadministration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  The social survey conducted during the project preparatory TA in April and July 2012 \nshowed that communities in the outer islands identify lack of employment and other income-\nearning opportunities as the main cause of hardship. Other causes cited included too many \ndependents, landlessness, the burden of family, community obligations, poor health, and poor \nfamily budgeting. The groups most vulnerable to hardship include children, youth, women, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. The project will address hardship by reducing the monthly expenses \nfor electricity services. In addition, in the case of Ha\u2019apai outer islands and Niuas, the project will \ncontribute to promote development of local craft manufacturing and sustainable tourism, which \nwill benefit the poor. \n \n31.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, with the majority of project \noutputs having specific gender design features to ensure that women participate in the project \nand have access to project benefits. The survey showed that the significant concerns of women \ninclude  (i)  affordability  of  urban  services,  (ii)  improving  power  usage  (conservation),  (iii) \nimproving the health and well-being of households and the community, (iv) having greater \naccess to information on urban services and urban planning, (v) having greater involvement in \ndeveloping  solutions  for  communities  through  women\u2019s  committee  support,  and  (vi)  being \ninvolved in consultation and decision making. The project gender action plan will address these \nconcerns and ensure that any potential harmful effects on women are avoided. The gender \naction plan includes specific actions that will benefit women.  \n \n32.  Key  gender  aspects  have  been  assessed  through  gender  analysis  and  community \nconsultations. It was found that the project will not have any negative impact on women. The \nproject will include the engagement of women in consultation activities; provision of gender \nawareness to target groups, including participation in income-generating activities; actions to ", "9 \n \nencourage women to participate in project-related contracts; and collection of gender-related \ndata for monitoring purposes.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). No significant environmental impacts will result from the implementation of \nthe proposed project. \n \n34.  Climate change. A climate risk profile for Tonga prepared by ADB in 2008 12 indicates \nthat the main impacts of climate change are expected to be high sea levels, extreme winds, and \nextremely  high  air  and  water  temperatures.  The  best  estimates  of  long-term,  systematic \nchanges in the average climate for Tonga indicate that by 2050 the sea level is likely to rise by \n36 centimeters; and the frequency of severe, short sea level rise resulting from storm surge \n(2.2 meters above mean sea level) will increase from a 1-in-580-year event to a 1-in-5-year \nevent. The project will provide solar photovoltaic plants that are compact, preassembled, and \nresistant to marine environments, and thereby resilient to climate change. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The project is not expected to involve land acquisition or restrictions on land use or \naccess to designated parks or protected areas. The project facilities will be constructed in \nexisting locations or on land owned by the government, TPL, or the individual owners of project \nfacilities. No third party or persons will be adversely affected. \n \n36.  The project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous \npeoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The beneficiaries in the project \nsites are part of mainstream Polynesian society and are not considered to be distinct from the \nmainstream society. They are not discriminated against due to their language, skin color, or \neducation level and do not require protection or special attention from the project. All project \noutputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate, participatory manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the risk  assessment  and risk management  plan.13 Mitigation  measures  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe project could face a capital cost overrun.
