Post-conflict \nconstruction,  trade,  transport,  and  communications  sectors.  Since  the \nsuccessful currency conversion in early 2003, prices and the exchange rate \nhave remained broadly stable, reflecting widespread acceptance of the new \ncurrency and prudent macroeconomic policies.   \n\nreconstruction  has  supported  growth \n\nin \n\nDespite  strong  economic  recovery  and  progress  made  with  structural \nreforms, the remaining challenges are enormous. Afghanistan is one of the \npoorest  countries  in  the  world,  with  a  GDP  per  capita  of  $300,  and  weak \nsocial  indicators.  Sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  will \nrequire  a  shift  from  reconstruction-driven  recovery  to  private  sector-led \ngrowth.  A  thriving  private  sector  is  also  essential  for  providing  alternative \nlivelihood in the rural areas, and thereby to supporting Government efforts to \neliminate  the  narcotics  economy.  Expanding  the  private  sector  will  entail, \ninter  alia, \nfrom  commercial  activities, \nstrengthening the investment climate, improving private enterprises\u2019 access \nto credit, and developing human capital. \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  disengaging \n\nThe Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS) embodies \nthe  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  for  2006\u20132010.  Private  sector \ndevelopment is one of the key outcomes envisioned in the I-ANDS.  To this \nend,  the  I-ANDS  includes  programs  to  strengthen  the  investment  climate, \npromote international trade, and develop the financial sector. \n\n\fii\n\nImpact and \nOutcome\n\nThe  initial  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP,  2002)  emphasizes  that \nAfghanistan\u2019s  long-term  economic  development  hinges  on  the  growth  of  a \ndynamic  private  sector.  The  initial  CSP  identifies  the  weaknesses  in  the \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  and  underdevelopment  of  the  financial \nsector  as  key  constraints  on  private  sector  development.  The  Program  is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008): \nAfghanistan.\n\nThe Program aims to promote private sector-led growth by (i) strengthening \nthe  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development,  (ii)  disengaging \nthe  Government  from  business  activity,  and  (iii)  improving  the  private \nsector\u2019s  access  to  financial  services.    The  impact  will  be  a  more  dynamic \nprivate sector and sound financial system supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth and job creation. The program outcomes will be larger contribution of \nthe private sector to economic activity and improved financial intermediation. \nThe  program  design  builds  on  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  reform  initiatives \nand complements other development partners\u2019 assistance. \n\nProgram Grant \nAmount\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by \nproviding a grant of $56 million to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The \ngrant will be from ADF. \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\nThe  implementation  period  of  the  Program  will  be  3  years.    It  will  be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2009  and  closed  on  30  June  2010.  The  grant \nwill  be  released  in  two  tranches:  the  first  ($28  million)  upon  grant \neffectiveness, and the second ($28 million) 24 months after Board approval, \nsubject to the Government meeting the conditions specified for release. \n\nExecuting\nAgency and \nImplementation\nArrangements \n\nProcurement  \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  grant. \nMOF,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  and  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  (DAB) \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies.  MOF  will  set  up  an  interagency \ncoordination  committee  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for  finance  and \ncomprising representatives from MOF, MOC, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), \nand DAB. The committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure \neffective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms.  ADB  will  also  be  a \nmember of the committee to oversee program progress. \n\nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of \nitems  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than  the \nitems  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources). The  Government  will  certify  that  the \nvolume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement under the grant for the given period. ADB reserves the right to \naudit  the  use  of  the  grant  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the \ngrant will be used, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the \nProgram,  and  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  general  development \npurposes.\n\n\f \n\niii\n\nCapacity-\nBuilding Grant \n\nthe \n\nlegal \n\nthe  Program.  Specifically, \n\nThe  objective  of  the  capacity-building  grant  is  to  assist  the  Government \nimplement \nthe  Government \n(i)  strengthen \nframework,  (ii)  remove  market  distortions, \n(iii)  disengage  the  Government  from  commercial  activities,  (iv)  strengthen \nimplement  accounting  and  auditing \nfinancial \nstandards.  The  grant  will  also  develop  and  establish  training  programs  in \nthese areas to help sustain private sector and financial market development \nover the long term. \n\nintermediation,  and  (v) \n\nit  will  help \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nA  capacity-building  grant  of  $4  million  will  be  provided  from  the  ADF.  The \ngrant will be subject to conditions set forth in the grant agreement. \n\nExecuting\nAgency and \nImplementation\nArrangements \n\nMOF will be the Executing Agency for the grant. MOF, MOC, and DAB will \nbe the implementing agencies. MOF will set an up interagency coordination \ncommittee  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for  finance,  and  comprising \nrepresentatives from MOF, MOC, MOJ, and DAB. ADB will be a member of \nthe committee to oversee implementation progress. \n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants.  A  total  of  64  person-months  of  international  and  132 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \n\nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries\n\nThe  Program  will  help  develop  the  private  sector  through  policy,  legal, \nregulatory, and institutional reforms to improve the investment climate and to \nstrengthen  financial  intermediation.  A  better  investment  climate  will  attract \nmore  domestic  and  foreign  investments  to  create  jobs.  The  entry  of  new \nbusinesses will reinforce competition and result in more efficient provision of \ngoods and services. \n\nThe  development  of  the  financial  sector  will  further  boost  private  sector \nactivity  and  create  jobs.  Private  enterprises  and  households  will  have \naccess  to  more  financial  resources  as  financial  institutions  are  able  to \nfinancial \nImproved \nsavings \nmobilize \nintermediation  will  reduce \nincurred  by  private \nenterprises and households. \n\ninvestment. \nthe  borrowing  costs \n\nfor  productive \n\nPrivate  sector  development  also  brings  about  fiscal  benefits.  Increased \nprivate sector output will reduce the need for the Government to provide the \nfiscal impetus for growth.  In addition, increased private sector activities will \ngenerate higher tax revenues, further creating fiscal space for expenditures \nto provide social services for the poor. \n\nSpecific benefits are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nBy  supporting  the  adoption  of  a  commercial  arbitration  law, \nthe Program will provide a recourse for settling disputes and \nhelp  reduce  the  uncertainty  and  risks  faced  by  business. \nPolicy  and  legal  measures  to  establish  land  ownership  will \nhelp improve access to credit by providing assets that can be \nused as collateral. \n\n\fiv\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nliquidate \n\nBy  helping  remove  the  distortions  caused  by  price  controls, \nthe  Program  will  allow  prices  to  adjust  to  market  conditions \nand  encourage  business  activity.    This  reform,  coupled  with \nmeasures  to  streamline  business  registration  and  permit \nprocedures,  will  deter  rent  seeking  associated  with  evading \nprice  controls  and  securing  business  permits.  These \nmeasures  will  also  enhance  market  competition,  thereby \nlowering  the  prices  and  improving  the  quality  of  goods  and \nservices. \nBy  helping \ninefficient  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs),  the  Program  will  reduce  state  presence  in  areas \nwhere  the  private  sector  can  be  more  efficient.  SOE \nliquidation will also facilitate the transfer of land to the private \nsector \nfor \nborrowing.\nBy  strengthening  financial  sector  regulation  and  oversight, \nthe  Program  will  enhance  depositor  protection  and  reduce \nsystemic risk.  This will, in turn, facilitate savings mobilization \nand enable financial institutions to expand their outreach.   \nBy  helping  adopt  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  the \nProgram will enhance transparency and disclosure of private \nenterprises\u2019  financial  conditions,  thereby  improving  their \naccess to financial services. \n\nincluding  as  collateral \n\nfor  productive  use, \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions\n\nSecurity  concerns  pose  a  key  external  risk  to  the  Program.    A  worsening \nsecurity  situation  could  hamper  reforms  as  the  Government  would  have  to \nfocus  its  resources  on  security.  Deteriorating  security  could  also  impede \nprogram  progress  as  it  would  be  more  difficult  to  attract  experts  to \nAfghanistan to help the Government implement the Program. \n\nCapacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risk  to  effective \nprogram  implementation.  For  instance,  weaknesses  in  the  drafting  of \nlegislative  proposals  by  the  executive  branch  of  the  Government  have \ndelayed some key legal reforms.  To ensure that the legal reforms called for \nunder  the  Program  meet  the  program  objectives,  the  attached  capacity-\nbuilding  grant  will  help  the  Government  draft  the  legislation  and  related \nregulations in line with international standards, taking into account country-\nspecific  circumstances.  The  grant  will  also  develop  comprehensive  training \nprograms  for  bank  supervisors  and  for  banking,  accounting,  and  auditing \nprofessionals to build capacity in these areas. \n\nVested interest groups could resist certain reforms. To minimize this risk, the \ngrant will facilitate training, consultations, and public awareness campaigns \nneeded to build consensus and solicit stakeholder buy-in. \n\nGiven  the  significant  donor  presence  in  Afghanistan,  assistance  might  be \nduplicated and ineffective. The Program was prepared in close consultation \nwith  Afghanistan\u2019s  development  partners \nin  private  sector \ndevelopment and financial reforms. Continued coordination during program \nimplementation will be required to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies. \n\ninvolved \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Private Sector and Financial Market \nDevelopment Program (the Program), and (ii) a proposed capacity-building grant for Supporting \nPrivate Sector and Financial Market Reforms. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nAfghanistan  has  made  significant  progress  in  achieving  macroeconomic  stability  since \nthe appointment of the post-Taliban administration in 2002. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew \nrapidly,  averaging  17%  during  the  past  4  years.  Post-conflict  reconstruction  efforts  have \ntransport,  and \ncontinued \ntelecommunications sectors. Since the successful currency conversion in early 2003, prices and \nthe exchange rate have remained broadly stable,1 reflecting widespread acceptance of the new \ncurrency  and  prudent  monetary  policies.  Fiscal  policy  has  likewise  been  prudent,  with \ngovernment spending kept within budget ceilings. \n\nto  support  growth,  particularly \n\nthe  construction, \n\ntrade, \n\nin \n\n3. \nThe share of agriculture (excluding opium production) in GDP fell from 49% in 2003 to \n38% in 2005 while the shares of industry have increased from 20% to 24% and of services from \n30% to 36%.2 While agriculture remains largely subsistence-oriented, farmers are increasingly \nproducing  cash  crops  for  sale  in  local  markets.  Agriculture  accounts  for  close  to  70%  of  total \nemployment.  Industry  is  mainly  construction  and  small-scale  agricultural  processing  and \nmanufacturing. Trade,  transport,  and  telecommunications  comprise  about  70%  of  the  service \nsector. It is estimated that 80\u201390% of all economic activity is in the informal sector. \n\n4. \nMedium-term  growth  prospects  remain  favorable,  albeit  more  moderate  than  in  recent \nyears.  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  slow  to  12%  in  2007  largely  due  to  the  ongoing  drought.3\nTelecommunications, transport, and trade are expected to continue to expand at a strong pace. \nWhile construction is likely to continue, its pace will be slower than in recent years. \n\n5. \nDespite  strong  economic  recovery  and  progress  made  with  structural  reforms,  the \nremaining  challenges  are  enormous.  Afghanistan  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world, \nwith  a  GDP  per  capita  of  $300  and  weak  social  indicators.    To  ensure  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction, Afghanistan will have to shift from reconstruction-driven recovery \nto private sector-led growth.  A thriving private sector is also essential for providing alternative \nlivelihood  in  the  rural  areas,  thereby  helping  the  Government  eradicate  the  opium  economy, \nwhich has grown to record levels in recent years.  Expanding the private sector will entail, inter \nalia, \nfrom  commercial  activities,  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment through legal and regulatory reforms, and improving private enterprises\u2019 access to \nfinancial services.  \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  disengaging \n\n                                                \n1   The inflation rate declined from 52% in  2003 to 15% in 2005. The currency has remained stable over the past  4 \n\nyears, ranging from AF44 to AF50 per dollar. \n\n2   International Monetary Fund. 2006. Country Report No. 06/114, Statistical Appendix.

Most industries \nwere  nationalized  during  the  1980s.  Traditional  manufacturing  industries  such  as  carpet \nweaving moved to neighboring countries during the conflict, and many businesses were forced \nto close down by lack of inputs. \n\n7. \nAfghanistan\u2019s total industrial production fell by 95% from 1979 to 2002. Private industrial \noutput was hit harder. The share of private sector industrial production fell from 60% in 1979 to \n21%  in  2002,  and  recovered  modestly  in  2005,  reaching  26%.  Private  sector  activity  is \nconcentrated \nthriving  as  post-conflict \nreconstruction  continues.  In  services,  the  trade  and  transport  sectors  dominate.    Enterprises \nengaged  in  basic  services  such  as  shops,  tailoring,  and  repair  services  are  also  prevalent.  \nrelatively  new  service  sectors  such  as \nPrivate  sector  activity  has \ntelecommunications and banking.   \n\nin  construction  and  services.  Construction \n\nincreased \n\nin \n\nis \n\n8. \nManufacturing  is  rudimentary  and  most  factories  are  concentrated  in  Kabul  and  some \nmajor cities like Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.6 Manufacturing is largely limited to traditional products \nand small-scale activities such as carpet weaving and dried fruit production.  Only a handful of \nmoderately  large  enterprises  and  a  few  medium-sized  enterprises  are  in  the  non-agricultural \nprivate  sector.7  A  large  part  of  the  non-agricultural  private  sector  consists  mainly  of  informal \nfamily-owned  microenterprises  engaged  in  trading  and  basic  services  such  as  shops,  sewing, \nand repair services. \n\n9. \nIt  is  estimated  that  80\u201390%  of  economic  activity  is  in  the  informal  sector  because  of \npolitical uncertainty and the lack of rule of law during the conflict, as well as inefficient business \nregistration procedures and the tax regime. Entrepreneurs in the informal sector typically remain \nsmall,  avoiding  investments  in  productive  assets  or  technology  that  would  enable  them  to \nachieve economies of scale and undertake higher value-added activities. The Government has \ntherefore recognized that the informal sector is unlikely to drive sustained growth over the long \nterm. The Government has also acknowledged that the informal sector serves as a cover and \nbreeding ground for illicit activities and provides opportunities for rent seeking,  \n\nHistorically,  there  has  been  strong  state  presence  in  formal  business  activity.  A \n10. \nsubstantial number of large enterprises are state-owned or under state control.  The commercial \nactivities  of the  65  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  organized  under  the  Law  on  State-Owned \nEnterprises (1960) range from public utilities, construction, manufacturing, agricultural services, \nwarehousing,  to  advertising  and  printing.  State  presence  in  business  is  also  manifested  in \nshareholdings by the Government in 13 joint stock companies organized under the Commercial \n\n                                                \n4   A detailed sector description is in Appendix 1. \n5   Bennett, A, Bruno de Schaetzen, Louis Dicks-Mireaux, Felix Fischer, Thierry Kalfon, and Ron van Rooden. 2005. \n\nReconstructing Afghanistan.

Four  ministries8  have  ownership  of  these  companies,  which  engage  in  a  wide \nrange  of  commercial  activities  such  as  airlines, \ntextile \nmanufacturing,  trading,  shipping,  and  warehousing.  A  number  of  ministries  also  directly  or \nindirectly conduct commercial activities such as leasing, production and marketing of agricultural \nproducts,  garment  manufacture,  operation  of  sports  facilities,  media,  and  cement  and  coal \nproduction.\n\ntelecommunications,  hotels, \n\n11. \nTo  establish  the  policy  framework  for  SOE  divestiture,  the  Government  adopted  the \nPrivatization Policy in 2005, reiterating its commitment to privatize enterprises and outlining the \ndifferent  privatization  and  liquidation  modalities.  The  policy  designates  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF) as responsible for SOE reforms and privatization.  The Law on State-Owned Enterprises \n(1960)  was  amended  in  2005  to  allow  private  participation  in  SOEs.  The  Government  issued \nliquidation procedures in 2006, detailing the key steps involved in the disposal of SOE assets. \nOf  the  65  SOEs,  56  are  targeted  for  divestiture,  and  the  remaining  9,  mostly  public  utility \ncompanies, are to be restructured and retained as SOEs.  \n\nThe Government has designated the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to lead private sector \n12. \ndevelopment.  MOC is guided by the Cabinet Economic Sub-Committee, and liaises with the 18-\nmember  Economic  Committee  of  Parliament.  MOC  is  rationalizing  its  structure  to  meet  its \nprivate  sector  development  mandate.  The  Government  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate for private enterprises.  The Law on Private Investment in Afghanistan was \nadopted  in  2005.    The  High  Commission  on  Investment,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  commerce \nwas  established  in  2002  to  set  the  overall  policy  directions  for  investment  promotion.  The \nAfghanistan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA)  was  established  in  2003  as  the  High \nCommission\u2019s implementing agency.   \n\n13. \nThe Government has initiated tax reforms supportive of private sector development.  The \nIncome Tax Law was amended in 2005 to expand the tax base and streamline the tax regime. \nCustoms  duties  have  likewise  been  rationalized.  Further  reforms  are  ongoing  to  remove \n\u201cnuisance\u201d taxes imposed by various government entities.9 The Government has adopted labor \nregulations governing hiring, firing, and working hours to facilitate private enterprises\u2019 business \noperations.   \n\n2. \n\nThe Financial Sector  \n\n14. \nThe  financial  sector  is  small,  consisting  of  commercial  banks,  microfinance  institutions, \ncredit unions, foreign exchange dealers, money service providers, an insurance company, and a \nleasing  company  (Table  1).  Commercial  banks  dominate \nfinancial  sector, \nrepresenting  95%  of  assets  in  the  formal  sector.  Given  that  much  of  the  economic  activity \noccurs in the informal private sector, the informal financial sector is estimated to be at least as \nlarge as the formal financial sector.  \n\nformal \n\nthe \n\n15. \nSince  the  passage  of  the  Law  of  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  (DAB)  (2003)  and  the  Law  of \nBanking in Afghanistan (2003), the central bank, DAB, has supervised commercial banks. More \nrecently,  DAB  has  issued  regulations  for  depository  microfinance  institutions,  money  service \nproviders,  and  foreign  exchange  dealers.10  Insurance  activities  are  supervised  by  MOF.  To \npromote the stability and integrity of the financial system, the Government has adopted the Anti-\n\n                                                \n8   Commerce, Communications, Finance, and Transportation and Civil Aviation. \n9   There  are  close  to  100  different  taxes,  and  the  administrative  costs  of  many  are  likely  to  outweigh  the  revenue \n\ngains. \n\n10 Under the law, DAB also has regulatory authority over payment system operators and securities service dealers. \n\n\f4\n\nMoney Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law (2004) and Law on Combating the Financing of \nTerrorism (2004).  To implement these laws, a financial intelligence unit has been established in \nDAB.\n\nTable 1: Financial Sector Overview \n(end of 2005) \n\nNumber \n\nForeign banks \n\nItem\nLicensed commercial banksa \n  State-owned banks  \n  Domestic private banks \n \nMicrofinance institutions \nCredit unions \nInsurance companyb \nLeasing company  \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na The list of commercial banks excludes one bank which was established in June 2006. \nb Data estimated as of end of March 2005. \nSources: Da Afghanistan Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nAssets \n(AF million) \n28,985 \n11,764 \n10,763 \n6,584 \n499 \n500 \n385 \n(cid:127)\n\n12 \n  3 \n  4 \n  5 \n  5 \n  7 \n  1 \n  1 \n\nAssets\n(% of GDP) \n\n8.8 \n3.5 \n3.3 \n2.0 \n0.2 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n(cid:127)\n\n16. \nBy the end of the conflict in 2001, the banking system had been reduced to a shell. The \nsix  state-owned  banks\u2014Bank  Millie  Afghan,  Pashtany  Tejaraty  Bank,  Export  Promotion  Bank, \nAgriculture Development Bank, Industrial Development Bank of Afghanistan and Mortgage and \nConstruction  Bank\u2014were  non-operational.    Of  the  six,  only  the  first  three  were  relicensed  by \nDAB.  DAB  has  licensed  10  private  banks  (5  domestic  banks  and  5  foreign  bank  branches), \nbringing the total number of commercial banks to 13 as of June 2006. Despite rapid growth in \nrecent years, the banking sector is small relative to the economy, and bank assets account for \nless than 9% of GDP (Table 1). Commercial banks operate fewer than 60 branches nationwide, \nalmost  a  third  of  which  are  in  Kabul.  The  banking  system  is  heavily  \u201cdollarized\u201d,  with  77%  of \ntotal deposits and 84% of total loans denominated in dollars.\n\nTable 2: Banking System, end of 2005 \n(AF million) \n\nAssets \n11,674 \n\nLoans \n1,775 \n\nDeposits \n2,896 \n\nCapital \n7,949 \n\nPrivate banks \n\n10,763 \n\n4,737 \n\n7,461 \n\n1,629 \n\nItem \nState-owned banks \n\nBank Millie Afghan, Pashtany Tejaraty Bank, Export \nPromotion Bank \n\nAfghanistan International Bank, Arian Bank, First  \nMicrofinance Bank, Kabul Bank \n\nBranches of foreign banks \n\nStandard Chartered Bank, Punjab National Bank,    \nNational Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bank Ltd, Bank \nAlfalah\n \n\n \nNumbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Da Afghanistan Bank. \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n6,548 \n\n339 \n\n5,866 \n\n(cid:127)\n\n28,985 \n\n6,852 \n\n16,224 \n\n9,579 \n\n\f \n\n  5\n\nBusiness  access  to  formal  credit  is  limited.  Loans  granted  by  commercial  banks  at  the \n17. \nend of 2005 amounted to AF6.9 billion, comprising only 30% of banking sector assets (Table 2).  \nFirst, the weak operational capacity of the three relicensed state-owned banks constrains their \nlending capacity. Their lending is limited to 15% of their total assets and only 26% of total bank \nloans. Second, a number of private sector banks are focused primarily on selected markets. For \nexample,  First  Microfinance  Bank  was  established  to  focus  on  microfinance,  and  Arian  Bank \nfocuses almost exclusively on trade finance. Third, the five foreign banks have not been lending \nto  private  enterprises  and  instead  have  collectively  focused  on  transactions  with  embassies, \nnongovernment organizations, development partners, and a few large corporate entities.  Bank \nlending is mostly short term and therefore not conducive to productive long-term investment. \n\n18. \nDespite  a  steady  increase  in  recent  years,  bank  deposits  remain  low  at  3.6%  of  GDP \nand  are  mostly  short  term.    State-owned  banks,  despite  their  size  and  geographic  reach, \ngenerate only less than 20% of aggregate deposits in the banking sector.   \n\n19. \nTotal  lending  by  the  five  microfinance  institutions  and  seven  credit  unions  account  for \n13%  of  the  lending  by  the  financial  sector.  Women  comprise  over  75%  of  microfinance \nborrowers, and more than half of outstanding loans support small retail, trading, and agricultural \nenterprises.  The  Government  launched  the  Microfinance  Investment  Support  Facility  for \nAfghanistan  (MISFA)  in  2002  to  provide  an  umbrella  organization  to  support  microfinance \ndevelopment.    MISFA\u2019s  primary  role  is  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  wholesale \nfunding to microfinance organizations by channeling aid agency funds. Lending by aid agencies \nthrough MISFA amounted to about $21 million to 160,000 borrowers in January 2006. Although \ngrowing  rapidly,  microfinance  outreach  is  significantly  below  the  estimated  client  base  of  5 \nmillion.\n\nThe  money  dealers  (hawaladars)  have  long  provided  financial  services  in  Afghanistan. \n20. \nThey may number as many as 2,000 country-wide and offer a well-organized, convenient, and \ncost-effective system for making international and domestic payments.11 They provide a range \nof services such as foreign exchange trading, fund safekeeping, domestic and international fund \ntransfers, and trade finance.  Over 20% of businesses are estimated to borrow from hawaladars\n(footnote 6, page 23). \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n21. \nDespite  significant  progress,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  transform  the  private  sector \ninto  the  main  engine  of  economic  growth.    Conflict  and  civil  strife  have  not  only  damaged  the \nphysical infrastructure but also substantially weakened the institutional basis and human capital \nnecessary to support private sector activity. Private sector-led development will therefore be a \nchallenging  and  gradual  process.    Consequently,  the  Government  will  have  to  prioritize  the \nareas of reform over the medium term as well as build human capital to sustain reforms over the \nlong term.\n\n1. \n\nLack of Enabling Environment \n\na. \n\nWeaknesses in the Legal Framework for Commercial Activities \n\n22. \nThe  weaknesses  in  the  legal  framework  for  commercial  activities  and  financial \ntransactions  are  fundamental  impediments  to  private  sector  development.    First,  a  number  of \nexisting laws are outdated. For example, the Commercial Code was enacted in 1955 and does \n                                                \n11  Estimates vary from 500 to 2000. World Bank. 2003. The Money Exchange Dealers of Kabul. Washington, DC. \n\n\f6\n\nnot  reflect  current  economic  and  business  conditions.    Second,  the  absence  of  an  efficient \nmechanism for resolving commercial disputes compounds the high level of uncertainty and risks \nfaced  by  private  enterprises.  All  business  disputes  need  to  be  settled  in  court  and  there  is  no \nlegal basis for out-of-court dispute resolution. However, court procedures are cumbersome and \ncostly.  Third,  the  lack  of  legal  basis  for  land  titling  also  constitutes  a  major  impediment. \nSpecifically,  lack  of  clarity  in  property  rights  prevents  the  use  of  land  as  collateral  to  secure \nloans, thereby constraining business establishment and expansion.   \n\nb. \n\nExistence of Price Controls and Market Entry Restrictions \n\n23. \nThe  Kabul  municipal  government  has  administered  price  controls  on  a  wide  range  of \ngoods  and  services  since  1985  to  benefit  low-income  households.  A  2005  International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  survey  indicates  most  goods  and  services  are  sold  significantly  above \nadministered  prices,  suggesting  that  the  price  controls  are  not  binding.  Businesses  are  often \nreported to bribe local authorities to avoid penalty for evading price controls.  The cost of rent \nseeking is passed on to the consumers, hurting the poor the most as goods and services under \nprice control are largely those consumed by them.   \n\n24. \nThe Cabinet issued a resolution in April 2006 instructing Kabul municipality to remove all \nprice  controls.  While  this  is  an  important  step  forward,  it  is  essential  that  the  municipal \ngovernment enforce the resolution and that prevailing prices reflect market conditions.   \n\n25. \n Inefficiencies  in  the  business  registration  and  permit  system  constitute  a  significant \nbarrier to market entry by private enterprises. In particular, municipal authorities exercise undue \ndiscretion,  and  the  decision  to  grant  or  deny  business  permits  is  not  necessarily  based  on \nbusiness principles. The lifting of price controls must therefore be accompanied by the removal \nof  market  entry  restrictions  to  prevent  undesirable  sharp  increases  in  prices.  Facilitating \nbusiness  formation  by  removing  this  barrier  would  reinforce  competition,  further  lowering  the \nprices and improving the quality of goods and services.  \n\n2. \n\nNeed to Accelerate Government\u2019s Disengagement  \nfrom Commercial Activities \n\n26. \nThe  majority  of  large  enterprises  are  either  state-owned  or  under  state  control. \nProlonged conflict has caused most SOEs to become nonfunctional or to operate at low levels \nof capacity utilization.  Some SOEs no longer engage in their core business, relying solely on \nrevenues  from  leasing  real  estate.    A  number  of  SOEs  have  historically  been  vested  with \ncollection  of  certain  fees  and  taxes,  and  regulatory  functions  such  as  licensing  and  quality \ncontrol  of  imported  pharmaceuticals  and  petroleum  products.    However,  the  SOEs  have  not \neffectively performed these functions because they lack human and financial resources.   \n\n27. \nGreater  private  sector  involvement  would  encourage  more  efficient  production  and \ndelivery  of  goods  and  services.  SOEs  have  ownership  of  land  estimated  at  nearly  10,000 \nhectares covering 636 sites. The divestment of SOEs would facilitate the release of land to the \nprivate sector for productive use, and ease one of the binding constraints on private enterprises.  \nWith  more  land  available  as  collateral  for  borrowing,  private  enterprises  would  have  more \naccess to bank credit. \n\nHowever,  MOF  has  limited  capacity  to  manage  SOE  privatization  and  liquidation.  Its \n28. \nSOE  Department  has  thus  far  focused  entirely  on  financial  management  oversight  of  SOEs. \nDivesture of SOEs is a new task that will require additional budget and qualified staff. \n\n\f \n\n  7\n\n3. \n\nUnderdeveloped Financial Sector and Limited Access to Finance \n\na. \n\nRemaining Gaps in the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework \n\nA basic legal framework for financial supervision has been put in place with the passage \n29. \nof the Law of Da Afghanistan Bank (2003) and the Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003).  DAB \nhas issued prudential regulations covering large exposures, foreign exchange positions, capital \nadequacy  requirements,  and  loan-loss  provisioning.  DAB  has  initiated  on-site  and  off-site \nsupervision  of  commercial  banks.  However,  there  are  remaining  gaps.    DAB  has  yet  to  issue \ndetailed  regulations  and  compliance  guidelines  for  banks\u2019  management  of  credit,  operational, \nand market risks.  The adoption of adequate risk management system has become more urgent \nas  banks  expand  credit  and  extend  operations  to  new  business  areas.  With  the  entry  of  five \nforeign bank branches, it is also crucial that DAB develop a structured program of information \nsharing  and  cooperation  with  the  home-country  supervisory  agencies.   DAB  has  no  access  to \ninformation that will enable it to comprehensively evaluate the financial positions of branches of \nfinancial  institutions  outside  its  jurisdiction.    As  these  branches  expand  operations,  or  more \nforeign  banks  establish  presence  in  Afghanistan,  establishing  mechanisms  for  cross-border \nsupervision becomes increasingly important. \n\n30. \nSystemic risk management requires an effective mechanism for monitoring compliance \nwith regulatory requirements and taking enforcement actions if warranted.  DAB\u2019s ability to take \nswift  action  against  distressed  banks  to  mitigate  systemic  risks  is  limited  by  the  absence  of \npolicies and procedures on conservatorship, receivership, and forced liquidation of banks. \n\nBuilding  depositor  confidence  in  the  banking  sector  is  vital  to  expanding  the  deposit \n31. \nbase.  This requires improved transparency and disclosure by banks.  While the submission of \naudited financial statements is required under the Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003), it is not \nenforced  as  the  implementing  regulations  have  not  been  developed.    Moreover,  there  is  no \nmechanism to disseminate information on banks\u2019 financial conditions to the public.  \n\n32. \nThe  outreach  of  the  microfinance  sector  is  growing  rapidly,  with  its  lending  accounting \nfor  13%  of  total  financial  sector  loans.  However,  the  licensing  and  regulatory  requirements  for \nmicrofinance  are  not  yet  enforced.  The  orderly  development  of  this  sector  requires  regulation \nand supervision of microfinance institutions, particularly those that accept deposits. \n\n33. \nThe  relative  inaccessibility  of  the  formal  financial  sector  to  the  public  encourages  the \ncontinued  use  of  hawaladars.    However,  as  registration  requirements  were  introduced  only \nrecently, little is known about this sector.  Given that financial transactions with hawaladars do \nnot  entail  legally  binding  contracts,  clients  must  be  protected  through  enhanced  transparency.  \nBetter  information  about  hawaladars  will  also  help  combat  money  laundering  and  financing  of \nterrorism.\n\n\f8\n\nb. \n\nAbsence of Accounting and Auditing Standards  \n\n34. \nTimely  and  reliable  disclosure  based  on  sound  accounting  and  auditing  standards  is \nessential  to  improve  private  enterprises\u2019  access  to  financial  services.  Afghanistan  has  yet  to \nadopt  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  has  no  legal  and  institutional  framework  to  set \nthem.  There is an acute shortage of qualified accountants and auditors because of the absence \nof professional associations and of curricula in formal educational institutions.  As a result, most \nprivate enterprises do not keep any accounting records or financial statements. The absence of \nnational  accounting  and  auditing  standards  impinges  on  private  enterprises\u2019  ability  to  access \ncredit,  as  financial  institutions  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  enterprises  that  do  not  have  reliable \nfinancial statements. \n\nC. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n35. \nThe  Interim  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  (I-ANDS)  embodies  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  objectives  and  strategies  for  2006\u20132010.  The  I-ANDS  covers  a \nbroad  spectrum  of  development  concerns,  including  security,  governance,  rule  of  law  and \nhuman  rights,  and  economic  and  social  development.12 The  I-ANDS  is  consistent  with  the \ncountry\u2019s commitments to the 2006 Afghanistan Compact, which represents the framework for \ncooperation between Afghanistan and its development partners.   \n\nI-ANDS \n\nincorporates \n\nthree  programs  specific \n\n36. \nThe  I-ANDS  aims  to  enable  the  private  sector  to  be  the  engine  of  growth,  improve \neconomic  opportunities  for  the  poor,  and  progressively  eliminate  the  narcotics  economy.  The \noverall  strategy  for  economic  and  social  development  is  to  prioritize  interventions  in:  (i) \ninfrastructure  development,  (ii)  institutional  and  human  capacity  development,  (iii)  social \nprotection,  and  (iv)  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurship  and  investment. \nThe \nto  private  sector  development:  (i) \nstrengthening  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  increasing  international  trade,  and  (iii)  developing \nfinancial  services.  Strengthening  the  investment  climate  involves  addressing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks,  improving  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  and  reducing  state  presence  in \nbusiness activities. The Government has prioritized trade liberalization toward WTO accession, \npreferential  trade  agreements  with  major  trading  partners,  and  customs  modernization.  The \nprogram on financial sector development (i) aims to achieve a competitive, market-oriented, and \nprivately-owned financial sector; (ii) underlines the need to strengthen financial supervision and \nto  restructure  state-owned  banks;  and  (iii)  calls  for  clarifying  property  rights  and  strengthening \nenforcement mechanisms to allow the productive use of land.  \n\n37. \nThe  Program  will  help  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  development  goals  by  providing  a \ndetailed  reform  agenda  that  is  in  line  with  the  I-ANDS.    The  Program  will  also  propose  a \nsequencing of policy actions, which is not explicit in the I-ANDS.  \n\nD. \n\nADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n\nThe  primary  focus  of  the  2002  initial  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)13  was  to \n38. \nsupport  reconstruction  and  economic  recovery.  Accordingly,  the  initial  CSP  adopted  a  broad-\nbased  approach  that  aimed  to  build  capacity  at  different  levels  of  government,  rehabilitate \nessential infrastructure, and promote social development. Private sector development was also \na  thematic  focus  of  the  initial  CSP,  which  highlighted  that  Afghanistan\u2019s  long-term  economic \ndevelopment  hinges  on  the  growth  of  a  vibrant  private  sector.  The  initial  CSP  identifies  the \n\n                                                \n12  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul.\n13  ADB. 2002.

Manila.\n\n\f \n\n  9\n\nweaknesses  in  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  and  underdevelopment  of  the  financial \nsector  as  key  constraints  to  private  sector  development.  The  Program  is  included  in  the  2005 \nCSP update.14\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to Afghanistan resumed with the Postconflict \n39. \nMultisector Program loan covering the financial, transport, and energy sectors.15  The program \nsupported the introduction of the new currency in 2003, and the modernization of the payment \nsystem through the enactment of a payments law and establishment of clearing and settlement \nfacilities  for  interbank  transactions.  Subsequent  ADB  operations  have  supported  infrastructure \nprojects such as roads, airports, energy, rural development, and fiscal and public administration \nreforms.  ADB  has  supported  the  Afghanistan  International  Bank,16  Afghanistan  Investment \nGuarantee Facility,17 Afghanistan Renewal Fund,18 and Roshan Cellular Telecommunications.19\n\n40. \nLessons  from  ADB  operations  have  been  incorporated  into  the  program  design.  A  key \nlesson  is  that  effective  development  assistance  requires  strong  government  ownership.  To \nensure Government ownership, the Program is formulated to be in line with the Government\u2019s \nown  development  agenda.  In  particular,  the  reform  measures  called  for  in  the  Program  are \nclosely  aligned  with  those  in  the  I-ANDS,  which  embodies  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term \ndevelopment objectives and strategies. \n\nSignificant  capacity  constraints  can  undermine  reform,  and  adequate  TA  must  be \n41. \nprovided  to  implementing  agencies.  To  remove  capacity  constraints,  the  Program  includes  a \ncapacity-building  grant  providing  up  to  $4  million  to  help  the  Government  implement  the \nProgram.  Capacity constraints likewise call for a more gradual phasing of reforms.  The timing \nand  the  sequencing  of  the  Program\u2019s  policy  actions,  as  well  as  the  attached  grant,  take  into \naccount Afghanistan\u2019s capacity-building needs. \n\n42. \nAnother  important  lesson  from  ADB  operations  is  the  need  to  go  beyond  technical \ncompliance with policy conditions to ensure that they achieve policy outcomes.  Drawing on this \nlesson, extensive consultations were held with key stakeholders to clarify the rationale for and \nthe underlying development objectives of the reform measures. These consultations need to be \ncontinued  during  program  implementation.  Effective  program  implementation  requires  not  only \nurging  the  Government  to  comply  with  policy  conditions  but  also  maintaining  intensive  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  and  stakeholders  to  evaluate  the  continued  relevance  of  the \npolicy measures and to assess their economic and social impact.  \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 2005.

This  implies  the  need  for  strong  complementarity  between  the  Program  and  projects \nsupported  by  other  donor  agencies,  particularly  IMF.  The  Program  was  developed  in  close \nconsultation with Afghanistan\u2019s other development partners.  \n\nE. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector   \n\n44. \nSince  2001,  Afghanistan  has  received  significant  support  to  develop  its  private  and \nfinancial sectors.  ADB has coordinated closely with Afghanistan\u2019s other development partners, \nand the Program is designed to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies.  \n\n45. \nThe  Program  complements  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Programmatic  Support  for  Institution \nBuilding,  which  includes  a  wide  range  of  structural  reform  measures.    Specifically,  the  World \nBank  program  has  supported  tax  reforms,  civil  service  reform,  adoption  of  the  Privatization \nPolicy, and adoption of basic prudential regulations. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment\u2019s  (USAID\u2019s)  Economic  Governance  and  Private  Sector  Strengthening  (Phase  II) \nincludes  support  for  the  drafting  of  a  number  of  commercial  laws,  and  the  institutional \nstrengthening of DAB by providing in-house advisors. The USAID\u2019s Land Titling and Economic \nRestructuring  Project  supports  the  drafting  of  a  land  policy  outlining  the  principles  and  policy \ndirections  for  formalizing  land  ownership  and  improving  land  use.  This  project  also  supported \nthe  drafting  of  the  Privatization  Policy,  amendments  to  the  Law  on  State-Owned  Enterprises \n(1960),  and  liquidation  procedures  to  facilitate  SOE  divestiture.  The  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  is  providing  advisory  support  to  the  MOC\u2019s \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Directorate,  which \nfor  promoting  business \ndevelopment services and for disseminating information on government policies and programs \nto  the  private  sector.  The  German  Technical  Cooperation  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  [GTZ])  is  supporting  the  institutional  strengthening  of  AISA,  the \ngovernment entity responsible for promoting domestic and foreign investment.  \n\nis  responsible \n\n46. \nStarting June 2006, the IMF extended its support for macroeconomic reforms under the \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). In financial sector reforms, the PRGF focuses \non restructuring or liquidation of the three state-owned banks that were relicensed in 2004. The \nDevelopment Coordination Matrix is in Appendix 2.   \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PRIVATE SECTOR \n\nAND FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n47. \nThe Program aims to promote private sector-led growth by (i) strengthening the enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  (ii)  disengaging  the  Government  from  business \nactivity, and (iii) improving the private sector\u2019s access to financial services.  The impact will be a \nmore  dynamic  private  sector  and  sound  financial  system  supporting  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and job creation. The program outcomes will be larger contribution of the private sector \nto  economic  activity  and  improved  financial  intermediation.  The  program  design  builds  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  reform  initiatives  and  complements  other  development  partners\u2019 \nassistance. \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  development  policy  letter \n\n48. \nand policy matrix are in Appendix 4. \n\n\f \n\n  11\n\nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\n49. \nA  key  feature  of  the  Program  is  its  two-pronged  approach  to  promoting  private  sector \ndevelopment.  First, the Program includes policy measures that directly affect the private sector. \nThe Program will help create an environment conducive to private sector growth by providing a \nbasic but essential legal framework  for commercial activities. It will also remove price controls \nand  facilitate  market  entry  by  simplifying  business  registration  and  permit  procedures.    It  will \nreduce  the  size  of  the  SOE  sector  and  transfer  productive  resources  to  the  private  sector. \nSecond,  the  Program  will  help  improve  depositor  confidence  in  the  financial  system  through \nbetter supervision and disclosure. This will, in turn, help financial institutions mobilize savings to \nmeet the financing needs of households and private enterprises. \n\nC. \n\nThe Proposed Program \n\n1. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\na. \n\nStrengthening the Environment for Private Sector Development \n\ni. \n\nEstablishing the Legal Framework \n\n A clear and comprehensive legal basis is fundamental for private sector development. \n50. \nTo address the weaknesses in the Commercial Code (1955), the Government is drafting a core \nset  of  basic  commercial  laws,  including  those  pertaining  to  the  formation  of  business \norganizations.  In  line  with  the  Program\u2019s  recommendation,  the  Government  has  drafted  a \ncommercial  arbitration  law,  which  will  provide  a  mechanism  for  business  dispute  resolution \noutside the court system.  The draft law is being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and \nis  expected  to  be  submitted  to  Parliament  by  early  2007.  The  alternative  dispute  resolution \nmechanism  will  reduce  the  uncertainty  and  costs  associated  with  inefficient  and  lengthy  court \nprocedures.  To  provide  the  legal  framework  for  land  titling,  the  Program  also  calls  for  the \nGovernment to adopt an immovable property formalization law. To prepare the groundwork for \nthis law, the Government is drafting a land policy outlining basic principles and policy directions \nfor formalizing land ownership and improving land use.\n\nii. \n\nEliminating Price Controls and Streamlining Business \nRegistration \n\n The two key market distortions include price controls and the inefficiencies in business \n51. \nregistration and permit procedures.  The existence of price controls on a wide range of goods \nand services in Kabul for over two decades has undermined market efficiency.  Moreover, this \nhas resulted in negative externalities associated with rent seeking to circumvent price controls.  \nIn line with the Program\u2019s recommendation, the Cabinet recently issued a resolution abolishing \nmunicipal price controls. To ensure that price controls do not continue to distort the market, the \nProgram  calls  on  MOC  to  monitor  and  enforce  compliance  by  the  municipal  authorities.  The \nProgram further recommends that MOC, in coordination with municipal governments, streamline \nbusiness  registration  and  permit  procedures  to  facilitate  market  entry  by  private  enterprises. \nRemoving this distortion will enhance market competition, thereby lower the price and improve \nthe quality of goods and services. The combination of removing price controls and streamlining \nbusiness registration will also minimize opportunities for rent seeking by the authorities. \n\n\f12\n\nb. \n\nDisengaging the Government from Business Activities \n\n52. \nUnder the Program, the Government will accelerate SOE divestiture through liquidation \nand  privatization  through  asset  sales,  which  entails  selling  the  core  business  in  one  package \nand  separately  selling  any  excess  land  not  required  for  the  core  business.20  The  Program \nproposes  that  the  Cabinet  approve  2021  out  of  the  39  SOEs  that  have  been  identified  by  the \nGovernment to be liquidated or privatized through asset sales.  The Program also recommends \nthat MOF establish for each SOE a liquidation committee comprising representatives from MOF, \nthe relevant line ministry, the Ministry of Economy, MOJ, and the General Attorney\u2019s Office. The \ncommittees will be responsible for timely and transparent divestiture of the SOEs. \n\n53. \nThe Program also recommends that MOF\u2019s SOE Department be restructured to create a \nunit responsible for managing privatization. This will require the allocation of additional budget to \nrecruit staff. \n\n54. \n Minimizing the social dislocations from SOE liquidation by providing a safety net is a key \nprogram priority. The Program urges the Government to allocate adequate funds for severance \npackages  for  the  employees  affected  by  SOE  liquidation.  The  Program  also  calls  for  the \nallocation  of  budget  for  and  the  provision  of  job  counseling  and  retraining  programs  for \nretrenched workers of SOEs through the National Skills Development Program of the Ministry of \nLabor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled. \n\nc. \n\nImproving Private Sector\u2019s Access to Financial Services \n\ni. \n\nStrengthening the Supervisory Framework for Financial \nInstitutions to (a) Improve Depositor Protection and \nConfidence in the Financial System, and (b) Enable Provision \nof More Services to the Private Sector \n\n55. \nA better supervised and more transparent financial sector will build depositor confidence \nin financial institutions, which is crucial to mobilize savings.  Improved regulation will result in a \nsound financial sector that can efficiently allocate resources and provide services to households \nand private enterprises. \n\n56.\nBanking  Sector.    Given  the  growing  presence  of  foreign  banks,  the  authorities  must \nestablish a mechanism for cross-border supervision. The Program recommends that DAB sign a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  home  country  supervisors  outlining  clear  and  workable \nprotocols for information sharing and coordination on issues of licensing, ongoing supervision of \ncross-border establishments, on-site examinations, and protection of confidentiality.22\n\nThe  Program  recommends \n\nintroduce  comprehensive  regulations  and \n57. \ncompliance  guidelines  for  banks  on  the  management  of  credit,  operational,  and  market  risks.  \nThe guidelines for credit risk management will provide banks with more details on the minimum \nnecessary  steps  toward  sound  risk  management,  including  establishing  an  appropriate  credit \n\nthat  DAB \n\n                                                \n20  Given  the  weak  operational  capacity  of  SOEs,  these  two  divestiture  modalities  are  deemed  to  be  the  most \n\nexpeditious.  \n\n21 Excluding the SOE to be divested under ADB. 2004.

The  guidelines  for  operational  risk  will  prescribe \ndetailed measures required to establish a robust operational environment and an internal control \nsystem, including clear lines of responsibility, segregation of duties, effective internal reporting, \nand contingency planning. The guidelines for market risk will reflect international best practices, \nfocusing  on  the  use  of a  standardized  approach  to  risk  measurement.  DAB  will  also  revise  its \non-site  and  off-site  examination  manuals  in  line  with  the  enhanced  risk  management  policies \nand procedures. \n\n58. \nThe Program supports the establishment of a uniform bank reporting system, including a \ndatabase  to  enable  DAB  to  systematically  assess  bank  performance.  The  Program  calls  on \nDAB  to  establish  a  tracking  system  to  manage  its  enforcement  actions.    To  manage  systemic \nrisks  posed  by  distressed  banks,  the  Program  will  support  the  adoption  of  policies  and \nprocedures on conservatorship, receivership, and forced liquidation. \n\n59. \nTo improve transparency and disclosure by banks, the Program recommends that DAB \n(i) issue regulations on the external audit of banks and qualifications of bank auditors and take \nremedial supervisory actions to ensure the timely submission of audited statements by banks, \nand (ii) regularly publish banks\u2019 financial statements on its website. \n\nThe  Program  will  help  DAB  make  parallel  efforts  to  strengthen  supervisory  capacity, \n60. \nparticularly  in  internal  control,  risk  management,  enforcement  actions,  and  back-office \noperations.   \n\nMicrofinance  Sector.    The  role  of  microfinance  institutions  in  providing  credit  has \n61.\nincreased significantly in recent years. However, the expansion is largely driven by aid agency \nfunds, and unmet demand is significant. To promote the sustainable development of this sector, \nthe Program calls on DAB to adopt and implement regulations on licensing and supervision of \ndepository  microfinance  institutions  to  ensure  depositor  protection.  This  would  strengthen \ndepositor  confidence  in  the  institutions,  enabling  them  to  mobilize  savings  to  expand  their \noutreach.\n\nInformal Financial Sector.  The Program proposes that DAB implement regulations on \n62.\nhawaladars covering registration, customer identification, reporting of suspicious activities, and \nrecord-keeping.  The  regulations  will  use  an  approach  that  is  effective,  but  not  excessively \nburdensome  to  avoid  driving  hawaladars  further  underground.    Given  the  large  number  of \nhawaladars, the Program recommends that DAB implement these regulations first in Kabul and \nthen in major provincial capitals. \n\nii. \n\nEnhancing Disclosure Requirements  \nto Improve the Private Sector\u2019s Access to Finance \n\n63. \nA  key  step  to  improve  private  enterprises\u2019  access  to  financial  services  is  to  strengthen \ntheir  financial  disclosure.    Under  the  Program,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to \nParliament  an  accounting  law  and  an  auditing  law  consistent  with  the  International  Financial \nReporting  Standards  (IFRS)  and  International  Standards  on  Auditing  (ISA),  respectively.    The \nlaw  will  apply  to  public  interest  entities,  which  are  those  that,  because  of  their  business,  size, \nnumber  of  employees,  or  corporate  status,  have  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.    While  the \nGovernment  prepared  the  terms  of  reference  for  an  accountancy  board  under  the  Postconflict \nMultisector  Program  (footnote  15),  the  board  is  not  yet  established.  To  ensure  adequate \noversight  of  the  profession,  the  Program  calls  for  the  establishment  of  an  accounting  and \n\n\f14\n\nauditing board comprising representatives from MOF, DAB, MOC, the Control and Audit Office, \nand  professional  accountants  and  auditors  from  the  private  sector.  To  support  the  accounting \nand  auditing  board,  the  Program  calls  on  MOF  to  create  a  unit,  consisting  of  at  least  three \nqualified people, to act as its secretariat.   \n\n64. \nIn  addition  to  its  oversight  functions,  the  accounting  and  auditing  board  will  be \nresponsible for developing the capacity of the accounting and auditing profession. In particular, \nthe  board  will  develop  certification  requirements  and  ethical  standards  for  accountants  and \nauditors.  The  board  will  establish  partnerships  with  formal  educational  institutions  to  provide \ntraining programs and courses in accounting and auditing. \n\n2. \n\nProgram Grant Size \n\n65. \nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a grant of \n$56 million. The program grant will be from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The following \nfactors  have  been  taken  into  account  in  determining  the  grant  size:  (i)  the  importance  of  the \nprivate  and  financial  sectors  for  sustaining  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  (ii)  the \nstrength of the Program and the financial and political cost associated with its implementation, \nand (iii) the overall development financing needs of the Government.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n66.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program.  MOF,  MOC,  and  DAB  will  be \nimplementing agencies.  MOF will set up an interagency coordination committee headed by the \ndeputy  minister  for  finance  and  comprising  representatives  from  MOF,  MOC,  MOJ,  and  DAB. \nThe committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure implementation of the reforms. \nADB will be a member of the committee to oversee the program progress.\n\n67.  MOF  will  (i)  oversee  the  liquidation  of  SOEs  and  the  accounting  and  auditing  reforms, \nincluding  the  drafting  of  an  accounting  law  and  an  auditing  law,  and  the  establishment  of  an \naccounting  and  auditing  board;  and  (ii)  coordinate  and  monitor  the  drafting  of  an  immovable \nproperty formalization law. MOC will (i) oversee the drafting of a commercial arbitration law and \n(ii)  coordinate  with  municipal  authorities  in  streamlining  business  registration  processes  and \nlifting municipal price controls.  DAB will oversee the financial sector reforms. \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  implementation  period  of  the  Program  will  be  3  years.    The  Program  will  be \n\n68. \ncompleted by 31 December 2009 and closed on 30 June 2010. \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n\nThe grant proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \n69. \nand procured in ADB member countries (but not of items in the negative list of ineligible items \n[Appendix 5] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government \nwill  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement under the grant for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \ngrant proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The disbursement of \nthe  grant  will  be  in  accordance  with  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.\n\n\f \n\n  15\n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n70. \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the grant will be \nused, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the Program, and second, to finance \nexpenditures for general development purposes. \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\nThe Government and ADB will continue to engage in policy dialogue  on sector issues, \n71. \npolicy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during  program  implementation  and  on  additional  reforms \nthat  may  be  considered  necessary  or  desirable.  ADB  will  field  regular  missions  to  confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain \nimplementation on course. \n\n72. \nThe grant will be released in two tranches. All first tranche release conditions have been \nfulfilled.  The  first  tranche  ($28  million)  will  be  released  upon  grant  effectiveness.    The  second \ntranche  ($28  million)  will  be  released  24  months  after  Board  approval,  provided  that  ADB  is \nsatisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  sufficient  progress  in  implementing  the  Program, \nparticularly  that  all  the  second  tranche  release  conditions  set  forth  in  bold  in  the  policy  matrix \nhave  been  met.  All  the  monitorable  actions  listed  in  the  policy  matrix  must  be  taken  by  the \nGovernment during the program period. While these actions are not conditions for the release of \nthe first or second tranche, they are crucial to achieving the program objectives. \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n73. \nThe Government will submit to ADB (i) semiannual reports on program implementation \nand accomplishments of the measures set forth in the development policy letter and the policy \nmatrix, which will describe progress made and any problem encountered and remedial actions \ntaken; and (ii) a program completion report within 3 months of program completion.   \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  Government,  through  MOF,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program  performance \n74. \nmonitoring system that will include a database on the status on policy measures and program \nindicators based on the policy matrix and the design and monitoring framework.\n\nh. \n\nProgram Review \n\n75. \nADB will monitor implementation through regular reviews and progress reports.  Based \non  these  reviews,  modifications  and  improvements  will  be  considered.    About  6  weeks  before \nthe  anticipated  withdrawal  of  the  second  tranche,  or  such  other  time  as  the  Government  and \nADB may agree, ADB will review the Government\u2019s progress in implementing the policy reforms \nunder  the  Program  set  out  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  including \nfulfillment of the conditions for the second tranche release listed in the policy matrix. \n\nD. \n\nThe Capacity Building Grant for Supporting Private Sector  \nand Financial Market Reforms \n\n \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n76. \nThe  objective  of  the  capacity-building  grant  is  to  assist  the  Government  implement  the \nProgram.

This  represents  64  person-months  of \ninternational  and  132  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  All  international  and \nnational  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  in  consultation  with  the  grant \ncoordination committee. The team of consultants for components I\u2013V will be recruited by ADB \nthrough a firm by quality-based selection (QBS) since capacity constraints pose significant risks \nto  program  implementation  and,  therefore,  quality-based  consulting  inputs  are  critical  in \ncapacity-building  initiatives  and  need  to  override  other  considerations.  The  consultants  for \ncomponent VI will be recruited by ADB as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procedures for \nRecruiting  Individual  Consultants  or  through  a  firm  by  QBS.  All  international  and  national \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nAll disbursement under  the grant will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n\n87. \nHandbook (January 2001).\n\nd. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n88.  MOF  will  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  on  grant  implementation  to  ADB  within  1 \nmonth  of  the  end  of  each  quarter  in  accordance  with  the  program  performance  monitoring \nsystem.  The  Government  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  for  the  grant  expenditure  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts and records audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will ensure that the progress reports, \naudited  accounts,  and  financial  statements  comply  with  ADB's  guidelines.  Audited  annual \naccounts, by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nof the reporting period.\n\ne. \n\nCapacity-Building Grant Review \n\n89. \nThe Government and ADB will periodically review grant implementation. The reviews will \ninclude  evaluation  of  the  grant  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress  of  the  policy \nreform  agenda,  and  capacity-building  measures.  ADB  will  field  regular  review  missions, \nincluding a midterm review mission, and project completion review missions.  \n\nE. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  document  Anticorruption  (1998  as  amended)  was  explained  to  and \n90. \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Grants. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption document are included in the \nGrant Regulations. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the capacity-\nbuilding  grant  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the Government and all consultants and other service providers as they \nrelate to the grant. \n\nADB,  together  with  the  World  Bank  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  are \n91. \nsupporting the development of a national anti-corruption strategy.  The strategy will help identify \nareas  that  are  most  prone  to  corruption,  sequence  necessary  interventions,  and  define \ninstitutional mandates to effectively implement various anti-corruption measures.   \n\n\f20\n\nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  taken  concrete  steps  to  improve  public  financial \n92. \nmanagement  (PFM).  The  Procurement  Law  (2005)  establishes  transparent  and  competitive \nprocurement  procedures,  and  specifies  the  responsibilities  and  accountabilities  of  government \nofficials. The Public Finance and Expenditure Management Law (2005) aims to improve PFM by \nstrengthening  reporting  requirements  and  requiring  independent  audit  of  financial  statements. \nWith  ADB  support,23  the  Government  is  taking  further  measures  to  strengthen  PFM  by \nimproving  fiduciary  controls  and  establishing  an  integrated  public  financial  management \ninformation system. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the outputs \nenvisaged under the Program are achieved. \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nreforms \n\nThe  Program  will  help  develop  the  private  sector  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and \n93. \ninstitutional \nfinancial \nintermediation. Improved investment climate will attract more domestic and foreign investments, \nwhich  will  create  jobs.  With  the  entry  of  new  businesses,  competition  will  be  reinforced  and \nresult in more efficient provision of goods and services. \n\ninvestment  climate  and \n\nto  strengthen \n\nimprove \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe  development  of  the  financial  sector  will  further  boost  private  sector  activity  and \n94. \ncreate jobs. Private enterprises and households will have access to more financial resources as \nfinancial  institutions  are  able  to  mobilize  savings  for  productive  use.  Improved  financial \nintermediation  will  reduce  the  borrowing  costs  incurred  by  private  enterprises  and  individual \nhouseholds. \n\n95. \nPrivate  sector  development  also  brings  about  fiscal  benefits.    Increased  private  sector \noutput  will  reduce  the  need  for  the  Government  to  provide  the  fiscal  impetus  for  growth.  \nIncreased private sector activities will generate higher tax revenues, further creating fiscal space \nfor expenditures to provide social services for the poor. \n\n96. \n\nSpecific benefits are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBy  supporting  the  adoption  of  a  commercial  arbitration  law,  the  Program  will \nprovide a recourse for settling disputes and help reduce the uncertainty and risks \nfaced  by  business.  Policy  and  legal  measures  to  establish  land  ownership  will \nhelp improve access to credit by providing assets that can be used as collateral. \nBy  helping  remove  the  distortions  caused  by  price  controls,  the  Program  will \nallow prices to adjust to market conditions and encourage business activity.  This \nreform,  coupled  with  measures  to  streamline  business  registration  procedures, \nwill  deter  rent  seeking  associated  with  evading  price  controls  and  securing \nbusiness  permits.  These  measures  will  also  enhance  market  competition, \nthereby lowering the prices and improving the quality of goods and services. \nBy helping liquidate inefficient SOEs, the Program will reduce state presence in \nareas  where  the  private  sector  can  be  more  efficient.  SOE  liquidation  will  also \nfacilitate the transfer of land to the private sector for productive use, including as \ncollateral for borrowing.\n\n                                                \n23  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Program \nCluster  of  Loans  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Fiscal  Management  and  Public  Administration \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2215-AFG[SF] and Grant 0030-AFG(SF), approved on 14 December).  \n\n\f \n\n  21\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nBy  strengthening  financial  sector  regulation  and  oversight,  the  Program  will \nenhance  depositor  protection  and  reduce  systemic  risk.    This  will,  in  turn, \nfacilitate  savings  mobilization  and  enable  financial  institutions  to  expand  their \noutreach.\nBy  helping  adopt  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  the  Program  will  enhance \ntransparency  and  disclosure  of  private  enterprises\u2019  financial  conditions,  thereby \nimproving their access to financial services. \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n97. \nSecurity  concerns  pose  a  key  external  risk  to  the  Program.    Worsening  security  could \nhamper reforms as the Government would have to focus its resources on security. Deteriorating \nsecurity could also impede program progress, as it would be more difficult to attract experts to \nAfghanistan to help the Government implement the Program. \n\n98. \nCapacity  constraints  are  the  most  significant  internal  risk  to  effective  program \nimplementation.  For  instance,  weaknesses  in  the  drafting  of  legislative  proposals  by  the \nexecutive branch of the Government have delayed some key legal reforms.  To ensure that the \nlegal reforms called for under the Program meet the program objectives, the attached capacity-\nbuilding grant will help the Government draft the legislation and related regulations in line with \ninternational  standards,  taking  into  account  country-specific  circumstances.  The  grant  will \ndevelop  comprehensive  training  programs  for  bank  supervisors  and  for  banking,  accounting, \nand auditing professionals to address capacity constraints in these areas.  \n\nVested  interest  groups could  resist  certain  reform  measures.  To  minimize  this  risk,  the \n99. \ngrant  will  facilitate  training,  consultations,  and  public  awareness  campaigns  needed  to  build \nconsensus and solicit stakeholder buy-in. \n\n100.  Given  the  significant  donor  presence,  assistance  might  be  duplicated  and  ineffective. \nThe  Program  was  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  Afghanistan\u2019s  development  partners \ninvolved  in  private  sector  development  and  financial  reforms.    Continued  coordination  during \nprogram implementation will be required to avoid overlap and to maximize synergies. \n\n101.  The detailed poverty reduction and social strategy of the Program is in Appendix 7.  The \nProgram  will  help  the  Government  implement  the  I-ANDS,  which  highlights  the  importance  of \nthe  private  sector  in  attaining  sustainable  economic  growth.    The  Program  is  pro-poor  in  its \ndirect  effect  on  creating  business  and  jobs  through  private  sector  development.    Providing  a \nsocial safety net for workers affected by the liquidation of SOEs is a key program priority.  No \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or \nfrom  program \nimplementation (category C). Overall, the environmental implications of Program were assessed \nand  no  significant  adverse  impact  was  identified.  The  Program  is  under  category  C  in  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment classification system. \n\nindigenous  peoples \n\nis  expected \n\nimpact  on \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n102.  Without limiting the scope, identified assurances in addition to the standard assurances \nand the policy conditions set forth in the Policy Matrix, will include: \n\n\f22\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nfor \n\nthat  have \n\nimplications \n\nThe  Government  will  advise  ADB  of  the  outcomes  of  policy  discussions  with \nother  multilateral  or  bilateral  agencies \nthe \nimplementation of the Program. \nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Program  Grant \nAgreement,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy \nmatrix), will continue in effect during the Program period and subsequently.  \nThe Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nincluded in the Program, as specified in the development policy letter (including \nthe policy matrix), and ensure that such policies and actions will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the Program and subsequently. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  staff  and  financing, \nneeded  to  implement  the  objectives  of  the  capacity-building  grant,  shall  be \nprovided.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  in  carrying  out  the  policy  measures  and \nactivities  included  in  the  policy  matrix,  due  consideration  shall  be  given  to  the \nfindings and recommendations provided under the capacity-building grant. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Grants Effectiveness \n\n103.  The  following  are  additional  conditions  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  grant \nagreement  (i)  the  capacity-building  grant  agreement  will  have  become  effective,  (ii)  the \nGovernment will have approved the liquidation or privatization through asset sales of 10 SOEs \n(excluding  the  SOEs  to  be  divested  under  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program),  and  (iii)  MOF  will \nhave  appointed  the  liquidation  committees  for  the  10  SOEs  to  implement  their  liquidation  or \nprivatization  through  asset  sales.  The  effectiveness  of  the  program  grant  agreement  will  be  a \ncondition of the effectiveness of the capacity-building grant agreement. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \n\n104. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  of  $56,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources, \nthe  Private  Sector  and  Financial  Market \nDevelopment Program, and \nthe  grant  of  $4,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds Resources, for the Capacity Building Grant for Private Sector and \nFinancial Market Reforms  \n\nfor \n\non the terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n22 November 2006\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n  23\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS:  PRIVATE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nDescription of the Private Sector \n\nPre-conflict Afghanistan had a vibrant private sector engaged mainly in the production of \n1. \nagricultural  products,  small-scale  industrial  activities,  and  trading.1  However,  more  than  two \ndecades  of  conflict  (1979\u20132001)  as  well  as  strong  state  intervention  have  caused  the  private \nsector  to contract  significantly.  Most  industries were  nationalized  during  the  1980s.  Traditional \nmanufacturing  industries,  such  as  carpet  weaving,  moved  to  neighboring  countries  during  the \nconflict,  and  many  businesses  were  forced  to  close  down  due  to  lack  of  inputs.  Moreover, \nconflict resulted in the depletion of the country\u2019s physical capital.   \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s  total  industrial  production  fell  by  95%  between  1979  and  2002.  Private \n2. \nindustrial output was hit harder, and its share in industrial production fell from 60% in 1979 to \n21%  in  2002,  and  recovered  modestly  in  2005  reaching  26%.  Private  sector  activities  are \nconcentrated \nthriving  as  post-conflict \nreconstruction  continues.  In  services,  trade  and  transport  sectors  dominate.    Enterprises \nengaged in basic services, such as shops, tailoring and repair services are also prevalent.  In \naddition,  there  is  increased  private  sector  activity  in  relatively  new  services  sectors  such  as \ntelecommunications and banking.   \n\nin  construction  and  services.  Construction \n\nis \n\n3. \nThere is limited current information on the state of manufacturing activity in Afghanistan.  \nResults  of  the  2005  World  Bank\u2019s  Afghanistan  Investment  Climate  Survey  indicate  a  gradual \nrecovery in the manufacturing sector. Surveyed firms indicate substantial growth in employment \n(67% between 2001 and 2005) and capacity utilization (10% between 2004 and 2005.  Median \noutput per worker in Afghanistan is higher compared with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan but only a \nthird  of  those  in  India  or  Pakistan.    Capacity  utilization  by  surveyed  firms  in  Afghanistan  is \nslightly lower than those in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (Table A1.1). \n\nTable A1.1:  Selected Manufacturing Statistics \n\nCountry \nAfghanistan \nIndia \nPakistan \nTajikistan \nUzbekistan \nSource:  World Bank. 2005.

It is estimated that 80\u201390% of economic \nactivity is in the informal sector. The large degree of informality stems from political uncertainty \nand lack of rule of law during the period of conflict.  Inefficient business registration procedures \n\n                                                \n1   Bennett, A, Bruno de Schaetzen, Louis Dicks-Mireaux, Felix Fischer, Thierry Kalfon, and Ron van Rooden. 2005. \n\nReconstructing Afghanistan.

Washington DC (p. 7). \n\n\f24\n24\n\nAppendix 1\n\nand  tax  regime  also  contribute  to  the  existence  of  the  informal  sector.  Entrepreneurs  in  the \ninformal sector typically remain small, avoiding investments in productive assets or technology \nthat  would  enable  them  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  and  undertake  higher  value  added \nactivities. The Government has therefore recognized that the informal sector is unlikely to drive \nsustained growth over the long term. The Government has also acknowledged that the informal \nsector serves as a cover and breeding ground for illicit activities and provides opportunities for \nrent seeking. \n\nB. \n\nLegal and Institutional Frameworks for Private Sector \n\n5. \nCommercial transactions are governed by the Commercial Code of 1955, which is based \non Turkish law dating back to the early 1900s.  There are also no laws to regulate mortgages \nand  the  use  of  negotiable  instruments  such  as  checks  and  promissory  notes.    Commercial \ncourts  exist  but  are  too  weak  to  effectively  resolve  commercial  disputes.  There  are  also  no \navenues of alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration or mediation.   \n\nTo  promote  the  development  of  the  formal  private  sector,  the  Government  has \n6. \ndesignated  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  to  be  the  lead  ministry  responsible  for  private \nsector development.  In this role, MOC is guided by the Cabinet Economic Sub-Committee, and \nliaises  with  the  18-member  Economic  Committee  of  the  Parliament.  MOC  is  in  the  process  of \nrationalizing its structure to be able to effectively meet its private sector development mandate.  \nIn  addition,  the  Government  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the  investment  climate.    The  Law  on \nPrivate Investment in Afghanistan was adopted in 2005.  The High Commission on Investment, \nchaired by the Minister of Commerce was established in 2002 to set the overall policy directions \nfor investment promotion. The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency was also established in \n2003 as the High Commission\u2019s implementing agency.   \n\n7. \nThe Government has also initiated tax reforms supportive of private sector development.  \nThe  Income  Tax  Law  was  amended  in  2005  to  expand  the  tax  base  and  streamline  the  tax \nregime.  Customs  duties  have  likewise  been  rationalized.  Further  tax  reforms  are  ongoing  to \nremove \u201cnuisance\u201d taxes imposed by various government entities.3 In addition, the Government \nhas  adopted  labor  regulations  governing  hiring,  firing,  and  working  hours  to  facilitate  private \nenterprises\u2019 business operations.   \n\nC. \n\nState-Owned Enterprises and Other Government Commercial Activity \n\nHistorically,  there  has  been  strong  state  presence  in  formal  business  activity.  A \n8. \nsubstantial number of large enterprises are state-owned or under state control.  The commercial \nactivities  of the  65  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  organized  under  the  Law  on  State-Owned \nEnterprises (1960) range from public utilities, construction, manufacturing, agricultural services, \nwarehousing, to advertising and printing. State presence in business is also manifested in share \nholdings  by  the  Government  in  13  joint  stock  companies  (JSCs)  organized  under  the \nCommercial  Code  (1955).      Four  ministries4  have  ownership  of  these  JSCs  that  engage  in  a \nwide  range  of  commercial  activities  such  as  airlines,  telecommunications,  hotels,  textile \nmanufacturing,  trading,  shipping  and  warehousing.  A  number  of  ministries  also  directly  or \nindirectly conduct commercial activities such as leasing, production and marketing of agricultural \n\n                                                \n3   There are close to 100 different taxes, and the administrative costs of many of these taxes are likely to outweigh \n\nthe revenue gains. \n\n4  Commerce, Communications, Finance, and Transportation and Civil Aviation. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n  25\n\nproducts,  garment  manufacture,  operation  of  sports  facilities,  media,  and  cement  and  coal \nproduction.\n\n9. \nTo  establish  the  policy  framework  for  SOE  divestiture,  the  Government  adopted  the \nPrivatization  Policy  in  2005  reiterating  its  commitment  to  privatize,  and  outlining  the  different \nprivatization and liquidation modalities. The Privatization Policy also designates the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) as the main ministry responsible for SOE reforms and privatization.  The Law on \nState-Owned  Enterprises  (1960)  was  amended  in  2005  to  allow  private  participation  in  SOEs. \nLikewise, the Government issued liquidation procedures in 2006 detailing the key step involved \nin  the  disposal  of  SOE  assets.  Of  the  65  SOEs,  56  are  targeted  for  divestiture,  and  the \nremaining 9, mostly public utility companies, are to be restructured and retained as SOEs.  \n\nD. \n\nDescription of the Financial Sector \n\nThe \n\nin  Afghanistan \n\nfinancial  sector \n\n10. \nis  small,  consisting  of  commercial  banks, \nmicrofinance institutions, credit unions, foreign exchange dealers, money service providers, an \ninsurance company and a leasing company.  Commercial banks dominate the formal financial \nsector,  representing  95%  of  assets  in  the  formal  sector.  Given  that  much  of  the  economic \nactivity occurs in the informal private sector, the informal financial sector is estimated to be at \nleast large as the formal financial sector. Since the passage of the Law of Da Afghanistan Bank \n(2003)  and  Law  of  Banking  in  Afghanistan  (2003),  the  central  bank,  Da  Afghanistan  Bank \n(DAB), has  supervised commercial banks. More recently, DAB has also issued regulations for \ndepository microfinance institutions, money service providers, and foreign exchange dealers.5\n\nBy  the  end  of  the  conflict  in  2001,  the  banking  system  in  Afghanistan  was  virtually  a \n11. \nshell.  The  six  state-owned  banks\u2013Bank  Millie  Afghan,  Pashtany  Tejaraty  Bank,  Export \nPromotion  Bank,  Agriculture  Development  Bank,  Industrial  Development  Bank  of  Afghanistan \nand Mortgage and Construction Bank\u2013were non-operational.  Of the six, only the first three were \nrelicensed  by  DAB  with  the  remaining  banks  targeted  for  liquidation.  In  addition,  DAB  has \nlicensed  10  private  banks  (5  domestic  banks  and  5  foreign  bank  branches),  bringing  the  total \nnumber of commercial banks to 13 as of June 2006. Total bank assets grew by 50% during the \nlast three quarters of 2005, with more than half of this coming from new private banks. Despite \nrapid  growth,  the  banking  system  is  still  very  small  with  banking  assets,  accounting  for  only \nabout 8.8% of GDP in end-2005. Commercial banks operate less than 60 branches nationwide, \nalmost a third of which are in Kabul. The banking system is heavily dollarized, with 77% of total \ndeposits and 84% of total loans denominated in dollars (Table A1.2). \n\n                                                \n5   Under the law, DAB also has authority over payment system operators and securities service dealers. \n\n\f26\n26\n\nAppendix 1\n\nTable A1.2:  Assets of the Banking System \n(AF million) \n\nItem \nState-Owned Banks \n \nPrivate Banks \n \nForeign Bank Branches \n \nBanking System \n \nNote: The figures in parentheses are the shares of the banking group to total banking assets.

Loans  granted  by  the  commercial  banks  at \n\n12. \nend-2005  amounted  to  AF6.9  billion,  comprising  only  30%  of  banking  sector  assets                      \n(Table A1.3).  Rather than lending, banks are investing in other financial assets offshore. There \nare several reasons for this.  First, the weak operational capacity of the three relicensed state-\nowned banks constrains their lending capacity. Lending by these banks is limited to 15% of their \ntotal  assets,  and  only  26%  of  total  loans  of  the  banking  system.  Second,  most  private  sector \nbanks  are  focused  primarily  on  selected  markets.

State-owned  banks,  despite  their  size  and  geographic  reach, \ngenerate only less than 20% of aggregate deposits in the banking sector (Table A1.4).   \n\n14. \nThere are five microfinance institutions and seven deposit-taking credit unions operating \nin Afghanistan. Collectively, these institutions account for about 13% of total credit provided by \nthe formal financial sector. At end-2005 the five credit unions had about 105,000 members with \ncollective deposits of 130 million Afghani, equivalent to an average deposit of $25 per member.  \nWomen  comprise  over  three-quarters  of  microfinance  borrowers,  and  more  than  half  of \noutstanding  microfinance  loans  support  small  retail,  trading  and  agricultural  enterprises.  The \nMicrofinance  Investment  Support  Facility  for  Afghanistan  (MISFA)  was  established  in  2002  to \nprovide  an  umbrella  organization  to  support  microfinance  development.  There  are  over  25 \nNGOs,  donors  and  other  international  organizations  active  through  MISFA,  which  provides \ntechnical assistance and wholesale funding for microfinance. Lending under MISFA amounted \nto about $21 million to 160,000 borrowers in January 2006.   \n\n15. \nAlthough growing rapidly, the microfinance sector\u2019s outreach is limited. MISFA estimates \ntotal  market  for  microfinance  lending  at  approximately  five  million  people.  In  addition  to  weak \ncapacity  of  microfinance  institutions,  security  concerns  continue  to  constrain  microfinance \noutreach.\n\nThe money dealers, referred to as hawaladars, have long existed in Afghanistan. These \n16. \nproviders of financial services, which may number as many as 2,000 country-wide, offer a well-\norganized,  convenient,  and  cost  effective  system  for  making  international  and  domestic \npayments.6 They provide a range of financial services such as foreign exchange trading, funds \nsafe keeping, domestic and international fund transfers, and trade finance.  It is estimated that \nover 20% of businesses borrow from hawaladars (footnote 2, page 23). \n\nThe hawaladars participate, along with financial institutions, in DAB\u2019s foreign exchange \n17. \nauctions.  Prior to introduction of the new currency in 2003, the hawaladars played a key role in \nproviding the local currency required for government expenditures through purchase of dollars \nprovided by donor agencies and auctioned by DAB. Without the critical role and cooperation of \n\n                                                \n6  Estimates vary from 500 to 2000. World Bank. 2003. The Money Exchange Dealers of Kabul. Washington, DC. \n\n\f28\n28\n\nAppendix 1\n\nthe  foreign  exchange  dealers  and  money  service  providers  in  the  banknote  exchange \nundertaken  in  2002,  the  introduction  of  the  new  Afghani  would  likely  have  failed.  Hawaladars\ncontinue to be used by international agencies for payments services. Over time, the growth of \nthe banking system and an efficient electronic payment system will provide viable alternatives to \nthe  informal  hawala  system,  however,  for  the  foreseeable  future  these  providers  of  informal \nremittance services will be an integral part of financial activities. \n\n18. \nVirtually all international remittances are routed through one of the Kabul dealers, which \ncollectively  account  for  the  vast  majority  of  hawala  payments.  Approximately  200  foreign \nexchange  dealers  and  money  service  providers  have  been  registered,  which  is  viewed  as \nsufficient to cover the bulk of the volume and value of transactions. However, it is too soon to \ndetermine whether the reporting requirements will be effective. A key challenge for DAB will be \nverifying the reporting and record-keeping of registered hawaladars in a cost-effective manner.  \n\nE. \n\nLegal, Supervisory, and Institutional Frameworks for Financial Sector \n\n19.  When the Taliban regime fell in 2001, DAB and the state-owned banks operated under \nthe 1994 Law on Money and Banking with the primary objectives of directing credit to various \nSOEs.  The  Law  of  Da  Afghanistan,  enacted  in  2003,  established  the  legal  independence  of \nDAB.  DAB\u2019s primary mandate is to achieve and maintain price stability. DAB is also responsible \nfor  promoting  the  soundness  and  the  stability  of  the  financial  system  and  payments  system.  \nThe Law of Banking in Afghanistan was also enacted in 2003 to provide the basic framework for \nthe  operation  of  banks  in  the  country.    Based  on  these  two  laws,  DAB  has  issued  basic \nregulations  on  licensing,  corporate  governance,  prohibited  and  authorized  activities,  large \nexposures,  lending  to  related  persons,  liquidity,  open  foreign  exchange  positions,  capital \nadequacy to asset classification and loan loss provisioning.  Over the past 12 months, DAB has \nalso  (i)  developed  an  on-site  bank examination  manual  and  procedures,  (ii)  completed  on-site \nexamination  of  five  banks,  (iii)  initiated  an  off-site  monitoring  program,  and  (iv)  conducted \nactions  to  enforce  compliance  to  DAB  regulations  on  reserve  requirements  and  open  foreign \nexchange positions. \n\n20. \nTo  promote  the  stability  and  integrity  of  the  financial  system,  the  Government  has \nadopted the Anti-Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law (2004) and Law on Combating \nthe  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2004).    To  implement  these  laws,  a  financial  intelligence  unit  has \nalso been established in DAB. \n\nThe Law of Banking in Afghanistan (2003) provides that DAB may apply part or all of the \n21. \nrequirements  of  the  Law  to  depository  microfinance  institutions.    DAB  has  recently  issued \nminimum  prudential  and  reporting  requirements  for  them.    In  2006,  DAB  also  adopted \nregulations  on  money  service  providers  and  foreign  exchange  dealers.  The  regulations  cover, \namong others, registration, customer identification, reporting of suspicious activities and record-\nkeeping.\n\n22. \nThe  insurance  sector  is  supervised  by  MOF.    The  Law  on  Insurance  was  amended  in \nInsurance  Company.

Since the fall of the Taliban \nregime  and  the  establishment  of  this  Government,  we  have  made  significant  progress  in \nachieving  political  and  macroeconomic  stability.  Building  on \nthe \nGovernment seeks to further transform the economy that will allow the shift from reconstruction-\ndriven recovery to private sector-led sustainable development.   \n\nthese  achievements, \n\nFollowing  extensive  consultation  with  stakeholders,  the  Government  has  adopted  the  Interim \nAfghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  (I-ANDS).    I-ANDS  embodies  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives and strategies for the period 2006\u20132010. Private sector development is \none  of  the  key  outcomes  envisioned  in  the  I-ANDS  as  it  is  essential  for  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  employment  generation.  A  thriving  private  sector  is  also  essential  for  providing \nalternative livelihood in the rural areas, thereby supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to eradicate \nthe narcotics economy. In addition, it will allow the Government to generate revenues that will \nprovide more services, particularly, for the poor. \n\nThe task ahead is formidable.  Years of conflict devastated Afghanistan\u2019s industrial capacity and \nthe  previously  thriving  private  sector  was  substantially  weakened.  At  its  current  state, \nAfghanistan\u2019s private sector has neither the capacity nor the resources to be a growth catalyst. \nThe  financial  sector  likewise  remains  nascent,  and  does  not  yet  play  a  meaningful  role  in \npromoting private sector development.  \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  efforts  will  focus  on  creating  an  enabling environment \nfor entrepreneurship and investment, reducing state presence in areas where the private sector \nwould  be  more  efficient,  and  improving  private  enterprises\u2019  access  to  credit.    Developing  the \nhuman  capital  base  will  also  be  fundamental  to  ensure  sustainable  development  of  these \nsectors.  In line with this, the Government, with the support the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill  undertake  the  Private  Sector  and  Financial  Market  Development  Program  (the  Program).   \nThe Program will focus on the following areas:  \n\nA. \n\nStrengthening the Enabling Environment for Private Sector Development \n\nThe weaknesses in the legal framework for commercial activities and financial transactions are \na fundamental impediment to private sector development.  A number of existing laws required \nfor private sector development are outdated.  For example, the Commercial Code was enacted \nin  1955  and  does  not  reflect  current  economic  and  business  conditions  in  Afghanistan.  The \nabsence of an efficient mechanism for resolving commercial disputes compounds the high level \nof uncertainty and risk faced by private enterprises.  The absence of a legal basis for land titling \n\n\fAppendix  4\n\n37\n\nalso constitutes a major impediment. Specifically, lack of clarity in property rights prevents the \nuse  of  land  as  collateral  to  secure  loans,  thereby  constraining  business  establishment  and \nexpansion.   Under the Program, Government will prioritize legal reforms aimed at addressing \nthese weaknesses. \n\nThe  Government  is  aware  that  price  controls  and  inefficiencies  in  the  business  registration \nprocedures undermine private sector growth.  The Government has recently issued a resolution \nabolishing price controls, and will take measures to ensure that municipal authorities enforce the \nresolution. While improving licensing procedures at the national level, the Government will also \nstreamline  the  business  permit  system  at  the  municipal  level  which  mainly  affects  small \nbusinesses.  \n\nB. \n\nDisengaging the Government from Business Activities \n\nThe Government recognizes that for Afghanistan to successfully transition to market economy, \nthe  state\u2019s  involvement  in  business  activities  needs  to  be  curtailed.    Several  years  of  central \nplanning  has  resulted  in  the  concentration  of  resources  in  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs), \nwhich are either nonfunctional or operate at low levels of capacity utilization. The divestment of \nSOEs  will  facilitate  the  release  of  land  to  the  private  sector  for  productive  use,  and  ease  the \nprivate enterprises\u2019 binding access to land constraint.  This will also improve private enterprises\u2019 \naccess to financing with more land available as collateral for borrowing. \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  resolve  to  disengage  from  business  activities  is  underlined  in  the \nPrivatization  Policy  adopted  in  2005.    To  facilitate  this  process,  the  Government  has  adopted \namendments  to  the  State-owned  Enterprises  Law,  and  has  issued  detailed  liquidation \nprocedures.    The  Government  has  identified  56  of  the  65  SOEs  to  be  targeted  for  divestiture \nthrough  asset  sales,1\nthrough  various  modalities \ncorporatization  and  sales  of  shares,  management  contracts,  long-term  leases  and  joint \nventures, while the remaining nine, mostly public utilities, are to be restructured and retained as \nSOEs.  Over the next 3 years, the Government will take measures to accelerate the divesture of \nSOEs in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nliquidation,  privatization \n\nincluding \n\nThe  Government  is  aware  that  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  to  manage  the \nprivatization  process  is  limited.    The  Government  will  strengthen  its  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement the divesture of SOEs by restructuring and building capacity in the SOE Department \nof  MOF.    To  this  end,  the  Government  will  allocate  adequate  budget  for  staff  recruitment  and \ntraining.\n\nTo ensure that social safety net is provided to workers affected by the liquidation of SOEs, the \nGovernment  will  allocate  a  budget  to  support  severance  packages.  The  Government  will  also \nallocate sufficient budget and will provide job counseling and retraining programs for retrenched \nworkers  of  SOEs  through  the  National  Skills  Development  Program  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor, \nSocial Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled. \n\nC. \n\nImproving the Private Sector\u2019s Access to Financial Services \n\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  to  enable  the  financial  sector  to  provide  better  financial \nservices to private enterprises, it is crucial that the banking system is sound and that depositors \nare protected.  The banking system as such must be adequately supervised and  meet proper \n\n                                                \n1  Privatization  through  asset  sales  is  selling  the  core  business  in  one  package  and  selling  any  excess  land  not \n\nrequired for the core business are separately. \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 4 \n\ntransparency and disclosure requirements.  Greater confidence in the banking system will allow \nbanks  to  mobilize  domestic  savings  to  meet  the  financing  needs  of  private  enterprises.  The \nbanking system also needs human resources to effectively deliver services to both households \nand private business.\n\nGiven  the  growing  presence  of  foreign  banks  in  Afghanistan,  it  is  crucial  that  the  authorities \nestablish  an  effective  mechanism  for  cross-border  supervision.  Under  the  Program,  the  Da \nAfghanistan Bank (DAB) will sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant home country \nsupervisors outlining: clear and workable protocols for information sharing and coordination on \nissues  of  licensing,  ongoing  supervision  of  cross-border  establishments,  on-site  examinations, \nand protection of confidentiality. \n\nTo  mitigate  systemic  risk  in  the  banking,  DAB  will  initially  adopt  regulation  on  minimum  risk \nmanagement  requirements  for  banks,  and  gradually  introduce  more  detailed  guidelines  for \nbanks on the management of credit, operational, and market risks.  To ensure compliance with \nthe regulatory requirements, DAB will establish a system to manage enforcement action, which \nincludes  a  tracking  system  for  such  actions.  To  manage  systemic  risks  posed  by  distressed \nbanks, DAB will also adopt policies and procedures on conservatorship, receivership and forced \nliquidation.\n\nImproving public confidence in the banking sector requires transparency based on reliable and \ntimely information.  Accordingly, DAB will issue regulations on the external audit of banks and \nqualifications  of  bank  auditors,  and  will  take  remedial  supervisory  actions  to  ensure  the  timely \nsubmission  of  audited  statements  by  banks.  DAB  will  also  publish  banks\u2019  financial  statements \non DAB\u2019s website.\n\nDAB will conduct parallel efforts to build capacity among supervisors, particularly in the areas of \ninternal control, risk management, enforcement actions, and back-office operations.   \n\nThe role of the microfinance sector in meeting the needs of small borrowers and depositors has \nincreased markedly in recent years. To promote the orderly development of this sector, DAB will \nadopt  and  implement  the  regulations  of  licensing  and  supervision  of  depository  microfinance \ninstitutions.  This  would  strengthen  depositor  confidence  thereby  enabling  them  to  mobilize \nsavings to expand their  outreach.  Likewise, to protect clients of money service providers and \nforeign  exchange  dealers  (hawaladars),  DAB  will  adopt  regulations  aimed  at  enhancing \ndisclosure about the hawaladars\u2019 financial transactions.  \n\nThe  absence  of  national  accounting  and  auditing  standards  impinges  on  private  enterprises\u2019 \nability to access credit.  To address this, the Government will adopt an accounting and auditing \nlaw  in  line  with  international  standards.  To  provide  the  needed  policy  and  institutional \nframeworks  for  the  timely  implementation  of  the  standards,  the  Government  will  establish  an \naccounting  and  auditing  board  under  MOF,  comprising  of  representatives  from  MOF,  DAB, \nMinistry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  Control  and  Audit  Office  and  professional  accountants  and \nauditors  from  the  private  sector.    In  addition,  to  address  the  acute  shortage  of  qualified \naccountants  and  auditors  in  Afghanistan,  the  accounting  and  auditing  board  will  define \naccreditation and examination requirements for the licensing of accountants and auditors, and \nwill issue standards for professional ethics.   \n\nThe Government understands that successful Program implementation depends on the ability of \nthe  Executing  and  Implementing  Agencies  to undertake reform measures in a timely manner.  \n\n\fAppendix  4\n\n39\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Matrix  \n\nThe objective of the Program is to promote the development of the private sector as the \n\nmain engine of economic growth by \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nstrengthening the enabling environment for private sector development, \ndisengaging  Government  from  business  activity  through  the  liquidation  of  state-\nowned enterprises, and \nimproving private sector\u2019s access to financial services. \n\nPolicy Objective\n\nFirst Tranche Conditions \n\nA.

The I-ANDS covers a broad spectrum of development \nconcerns,  including  security,  governance,  rule  of  law  and  human  rights,  and  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  The I-ANDS aims to transform the economy to enable the private sector to be the engine of \ngrowth,  empower  the  poor  to  participate  fully  in  that  growth,  and  progressively  eliminate  the  narcotics \neconomy.    The  overall  strategy  for  economic  and  social  development  is  to  prioritize  interventions  in: \n(i) infrastructure development, (ii) institutional and human capacity development, (iii) protecting the rights of \nthe  poor  and  social  protection,  and  (iv)  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurship  and \ninvestment. \n\nAfghanistan  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world,  with  per  capita  GDP  of  $300,  and  weak  social \nindicators.    To  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  alleviation,  Afghanistan  must  shift  from \nreconstruction-related recovery to private sector-driven growth. The strengthening of the private sector will \ngenerate  employment  with  the  increase  in  both  domestic  and  foreign  investments  resulting  from  better \ninvestment  climate.  With  the  entry  of  new  businesses,  competition  is  reinforced  and  will  result  in  more \nefficient  provision  of  goods  and  services.    There  are  also  fiscal  benefits  arising  from  private  sector \ndevelopment.  Increased private sector output will reduce the need for the Government to provide the fiscal \nimpetus  for  growth.    In  addition,  private  business  operations  will  generate  higher  tax  revenues,  further \ncreating fiscal space for expenditures to provide social services for the poor.  A thriving private sector is \nalso essential for providing alternative livelihood in the rural areas, thereby supporting Government efforts \nat eliminating the narcotics economy. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?\n\nUp-to-date  information  on  income  distribution  and  poverty  incidence  is  limited.  The  2004  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s Human Development Report ranked Afghanistan 173 out of a sample of 177 \ncountries, with a literacy rate of 29% , life expectancy at birth of 45 years, and infant mortality of 115 per \n1000 live birth. The 2003 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) conducted by the Ministry of \nRural Rehabilitation and Development suggests that economic and social conditions in the rural area are \nsignificantly worse.  An estimated 3.5 million out of the 17.5 million rural population live in extreme poverty, \nand  an  additional  10.5  million  are  vulnerable  to  extreme  poverty.    The  assessment  also  indicates  that \nmalnutrition is widespread in rural Kabul, and only 9% of the rural population has access to a health facility. \n\nAn NRVA was conducted more recently in 2005. The Central Statistics Office, with assistance from ADB \nand  World  Bank,  are  processing  the  survey  to  obtain  more  updated  poverty  estimates.    Results  are \nexpected by early 2007.   \n\n\fAppendix 7\n\n53\n\nC.
