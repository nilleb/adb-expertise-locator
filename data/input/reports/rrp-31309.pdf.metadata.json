The  program  will  help  the  learners  to  acquire\nfunctional  literacy,  and  social  and  income-generating\nskills  related  to  existing  employment  and  income-\ngenerating  opportunities.  These  will,  in  turn,  result  in\nincreased  social  awareness  and  improved  economic\nand  living  conditions.  The  proposed  project  will  (i)\ncontribute to the development of a policy framework for\nPLCE  based  on  decentralized  implementation  and\nlearners\u2019  participation  in  planning;  (ii)  explore  and\ndevelop  curriculum  approaches  and  disseminate\ncurricula  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  the  Project  and  for\nsimilar \ncurricula\nteaching/learning  methodologies,  and\ndevelopment, \ntraining  of \nthe  capacity  of\norganizations  involved  in  project  implementation  and\nstrengthen  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  functions  of\nGovernment;  and  (iv)  deliver  PLCE  to  1.6  million\nlearners in rural areas of Bangladesh.\n\nfuture  activities \n\nterms  of \n\n(iii)  build \n\ntrainers; \n\nin \n\nof \n\nDuring  the  project  period,  approximately  1.6  million\nlearners  from  29  districts  will  participate  in  PLCE\ncourses \nduration.  Nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) in each of the 210 subdistricts or\nUpazilas  of  the  29  districts  assigned  to  the  Project  will\nbe  responsible  for  the  decentralized  implementation  of\ncourses.\n\nvarying \n\nThe  British  Government  through  the  Department  For\nInternational  Development  (DFID)  will  cofinance  the\nProject.\n\nPoverty intervention\nThematic:  Human  Development;  Gender \nDevelopment\n\nand\n\nEnvironmental category: C\nEnvironmental  impact  has  been  reviewed  and  no\nadverse effects were identified\n\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  illiteracy  and  lack  of\nlife skills are major factors contributing to rural poverty.\nDespite  the  recent  strong  performance  in  improving\naccess to basic education for children, millions of adults\neither missed the chance to attend school altogether or\ndropped  out  after  a  few  years  of  school  and  remain\nfunctionally  illiterate.

Since 1991 the Government\nhas  funded  literacy  training  for  17  million  learners\nmainly  through  community-supported  centers  and  with\nthe  assistance  of  NGOs.    However,  the  graduates  of\nthese programs require further training to reinforce their\nskills  and  to  acquire  a  new  set  of  skills  aimed  at\nimproving  their  employability.  Given  the  vast  though\norganizationally fragmented experience in implementing\nnonformal education programs in the country as well as\nlimited implementation capacities, the Project promotes\npublic-private partnerships to ensure a poverty-focused\nand high-quality program.\n\nThe Project\u2019s long-term sector objective is to contribute\nto  the  reduction  of  poverty  through  more  equitable\nhuman development in rural areas. The purpose of the\nProject  is  to  establish  a  community-based  and  needs-\nsupportive\noriented \norganizational framework in 29 rural districts.\n\nprogram \n\ncourse \n\nand \n\na \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  will  be  achieved  by  (i)\nsupporting  the  development  of  a  policy  framework;  (ii)\ndeveloping,  producing,  distributing  and  continuously\nadapting  curricula  and  materials;  (iii)  improving  the\ncapacity \n(iv)\nimplementing PLCE courses.\n\norganizations; \n\ninvolved \n\nand \n\nof \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and\nprice contingencies, and taxes and duties, is estimated\nat  $99.7  million  equivalent.

The  Project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance\nplan  as  a  firm  2001  loan.  On  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)1\nbetween January and June 2001 to assist the Government in preparing the Project aimed at poor\nneo-literates2 in 29 districts.3 The Project will help to build an effective and sustainable system of\ncontinuing education in the country, and fill a critical gap in the Government\u2019s efforts to sustain the\nliteracy skills of neo-literates and promoting employable and income-generating skills for the poor.\nIn  the  past,  ADB  provided  assistance  to  the  Government  under  the  first  Nonformal  Education\nProject (NFEP-1)4 to establish the Directorate of Nonformal Education (DNFE) and for giving basic\nliteracy training to the poor. This Project will build on the investments made through NFEP-1 and\nstrengthen DNFE in its new role of supervising the implementation of post-literacy and continuing\neducation (PLCE) by private sector organizations including nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nThroughout  project  preparation,  there  was  close  consultation  with  government  officials  of  the\nPrimary  and  Mass  Education  Division  (PMED),  DNFE,  NGOs,  envisaged  beneficiaries  at\ncommunity level, and education and training providers. All external funding agencies contributing to\nthe subsector were also consulted closely during Project processing. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nSocioeconomic Context\n\n3.\nBangladesh  is  a  low-income  country,  with  a  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of\n$381 in FY2000.  Given the current population size of an estimated 129.3 million and population\ngrowth rate of 1.47 percent per annum, the population grows by about 2 million annually. Although\nBangladesh  has  achieved  a  commendable  average  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of  about  5  percent\nduring recent years, the poor, especially in rural areas, have derived little or no benefit from such\ngrowth due to great inequality in income levels.\n\n4.\nAlthough  declining,  poverty  remains  widespread.  The  high  poverty  incidence  of  44.7\npercent in 1999, compared with 47.0 percent in 1996, indicates that almost 60 million people are\nstill  living  below  the  poverty  line.5  During  1996-1999,  rural  poverty  declined  from  47.9  percent  to\n44.9  percent,  whereas  urban  poverty  declined  slightly  from  44.4  percent  to  43.3  percent.    This\ntrend  is  confirmed  by  other  poverty  indicators,  such  as  the  human  poverty  index  ([HPI]  which\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3465-BAN: Second Nonformal Education Project, for $600,000, approved on 5 July 2000.\n2   Neo-literates are learners who have acquired basic literacy skills in one of the nonformal education programs.\n3  The Project will be implemented in 29 of a total of 64 districts and in 210 subdistricts or Upazilas.\n4 Loan  1390-BAN  (SF): Nonformal Education Project,  for  $26.7  million,  approved  on  29  September  1995.  The  project\n\nterminated on 30 June 2001.\n\n5  Publication of poverty-related figures based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000, due in July 2001,\n\nhas been delayed. There are indications that the survey may estimate the poverty rate at about 50 percent.\n\n\f2\n\nmeasures  the  overall  deprivation  of  four  basic  dimensions  of  human  life:  a  long  and  healthy  life,\nknowledge, economic provisioning, and social inclusion) and the human development index ([HDI]\nwhich measures overall progress in achieving human development in three basic dimensions: life\nexpectancy,  educational  attainment,  and  real  income).  For  example,  HPI  declined  from  46.5\npercent in 1995 to 44.4 percent in 1997.  The HDI of 0.46 in 1998 resulted in an HDI ranking that\nput Bangladesh in 146th place among 174 countries.\n\n5.\nEighty  percent  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas  and  over  75  percent  of  the  labor  force\nwork in agriculture. Agriculture\u2019s share in GDP fell from 36 percent in 1979 to less than 20 percent\nin  1999.  Future  increases  in  employment  will  have  to  be  found  increasingly  in  the  nonagriculture\nsectors whether in urban or rural areas. The labor force is predicted to grow by 50 million to 100\nmillion  over  the  next  20  years  based  on  previous  fertility  levels.  The  number  of  workers  entering\nthe workforce during the next 10 years will be growing at about 3 percent per year. Employment\nwill accordingly need to grow in excess of 3 percent to avoid increased levels of underemployment.\nWith little room for increased agricultural employment, nonfarm employment has to absorb surplus\nlabor  in  rural  areas  (for  example  in  formal/informal  manufacturing,  trade,  transport,  and\nconstruction).\n\n6.\nEducation  and  level  of  skills  largely  determine  the  specific  occupational  opportunities  that\nthe poor can avail themselves of. However, the poor have few educational skills training or skills\nenhancement opportunities. This places special demands on the education sector in general and\non  nonformal  education  (NFE)  in  particular.  The  Government's  efforts  to  improve  education  are\nreflected  in  increased  education  expenditure  during  the  past  decade,  from  2.2  percent  to  2.75\npercent of GDP in FY 2000/01. Poverty reduction through accelerated economic growth is the main\nthrust of the Government's medium-term development strategy laid out in the country's current Fifth\nFive-Year Plan (1997-2002).6\n\n7.\nThe  correlation  between  education  and  poverty  is  well  established.  The  Government\npromotes NFE as an important means of poverty reduction. Significant investments in basic literacy\nprograms have resulted in raising the literacy rate from 35 percent in 1990 to about 64 percent in\n2000 for people aged 15 and over. Although the female literacy rate still lags behind that of males\n(57.0  percent  versus  67.0  percent),  the  impact  of  this  achievement  can  be  seen  across  social\nsectors,  most  notably  in  improved  population  life  expectancy  and  lower  fertility  rates.  In  a  recent\npilot  study  that  combined  literacy  development  with  vocational  skills  training,  learners  reported\nincreased  income  opportunities,  improved  health,  better  hygiene,  and  higher  social  awareness.7\nThis  suggests  that  focusing  resources  on  literacy  training  combined  with  nonformal  continuing\neducation can have a strong impact on poverty.\n\n2.\n\nThe Formal Education System\n\n8.\nThe current education system in Bangladesh consists of five years of compulsory primary\neducation  and  seven  years  of  secondary  education  comprising  three  years  of  junior  secondary\n(grades 6-8), two years of secondary (grades 9-10), and two years of higher secondary education\n(grades  11-12).  Bangladesh  has  made  considerable  strides  in  providing  access  to  primary\neducation for all. Enrollments in the country\u2019s 77,000 primary schools have grown rapidly in recent\nyears  to  reach  a  total  of  over  17.7  million  children,  10.8  million  of  whom  are  in  Government\nschools.  Official  data  for  June  2000  show  that  the  gross  primary  enrollment  rate  increased  from\n77.0 percent to 97.0 percent over the past decade, while the current net primary enrollment rate is\n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission.  1998.

Dhaka, April.\n\n\f3\n\nover  81  percent.8  These  improving  enrollment  rates  mask  a  persistent  problem  of  unequal\nparticipation rates for poor children. Although the net enrollment for primary education is close to\n82 percent, the net enrollment for poor children is only 70 percent. The number of dropouts from\nprimary school is still high, with 18 percent of girls and 15 percent of boys dropping out in the first\nyear,  and  only  60  percent  of  children  completing  primary  school  due  to  problems  of  quality  and\nabsenteeism.9 Several field studies have shown that the prime cause of student absenteeism and\ndropout is the poverty of their families, for whom children\u2019s attendance at school represents a real\ncost from loss of labor and inability to fund costs of clothing and supplies. To address this matter,\nthe  Government  has  instituted  pro-poor  enrollment  policies  including  a  Food  for  Education\nProgram,  now  active  in  about  25  percent  (17,000)  of  schools,  which  provides  food  benefits  to\nfamilies of over 2,200,000 poor students; and a primary school stipend program, which provides 40\npercent of all students with stipends of Tk25 per month.\n\nThe  same  studies  also  cite  factors  related  to  the  education  system\u2019s  poor  quality  and\n9.\nmanagement. The low quality of education, particularly in schools serving the poor, is a matter of\nconcern.  Poorly  motivated  teachers,  crowded  physical  facilities,  and  very  low  contact  hours\ncontinue  to  plague  the  system.  Quality  issues  include  poor  learning  environments,  delivery  and\nmethodological  approaches  that  fail  to  motivate  children  and  their  families,  overcrowded\nclassrooms or classrooms in poor conditions, low contact hours, shortages of textbooks and other\ninstructional  materials,  inadequate  and  poorly  prepared  teachers.  An  ADB  study  of  primary\neducation  classroom  behavior  indicated  that  teachers  use  pedagogical  methods  that  are\ninappropriate  for  the  student  age  group  and  the  curriculum.  System  management  issues  include\ntoo few appointed teachers, absent and tardy teachers, teachers who leave in midyear and cannot\nbe  replaced,  teachers  with  low  motivation  and  inadequate  training,  and  the  double  shift  system,\nwhich  is  a  burden  for  children  in  grades  3-5  who  are  poorly  motivated  to  attend  school  in  the\nafternoon.\n\n10.\nGovernment  budgetary  allocations  (revenue  and  development)  to  the  education  sector  in\n2000-2001  total  nearly  $1,100  million,  which  represents  an  estimated  15.0  percent  of  the  total\nGovernment budget and 2.75 percent of GDP. Of the education sector budget, a high proportion,\n47 percent, is allocated to basic education. Allocations to the education sector have increased year\nby  year  at  current  prices,  but  since  1994/95  the  growth  in  allocations  has  not  been  sufficient  to\nkeep pace with the growth of the number of pupils. Education expenditure as a percent of the total\nGovernment budget and as a percent of GDP, and primary education expenditure per pupil in real\nterms  in  constant  (1994/95)  prices  have  been  falling  steadily  and  are  now  significantly  below  the\n1994/95 levels. Total external assistance to the education sector also has declined over the same\nperiod.\n\n3.\n\n Nonformal Education\n\n11.\nUnlike many developing countries, Bangladesh has a largely homogeneous population with\na common cultural and linguistic identity. The fact that Bangla is spoken throughout the country is\nparticularly  advantageous  in  the  spread  of  literacy  and  basic  education.  Reflecting  the\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  promoting  literacy,  there  have  been  significant  improvements  in\naccess  to  NFE  in  the  last  decade.  Since  the  first  ADB-supported  NFE  project,  the  Government\nthrough  the  DNFE  has  provided  basic  literacy  education  to  17  million  learners,  aged  between  8\nand 45, who have not attended school or who dropped out of school. Although there is a problem\nof incomplete data about achievements of these projects, available data suggest that between 51\n\n                                                \n8 The gross enrollment rate is defined as the total number of pupils enrolled in a given level of education irrespective of\nage, expressed as percentage of the total population of the corresponding school-age range; and the net enrollment\nrate denotes the number of pupils of the official school age enrolled in school, expressed as a percentage of the total\npopulation of the same age group.\n\n9  World Bank. 2000.

The courses are of various duration,\nfollow  diverse  objectives,  and  are  implemented  by  NGOs  and  by  several  Government  ministries,\noften  aided  by  external  assistance  (e.g.,  30,000  children  in  NFE  centers  funded  by  the  United\nNations  Development  Programme  [UNDP],  under  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare.  DNFE  is\nresponsible for all Government-funded basic literacy and post-literacy programs. Most courses last\nfor  9  months  (6  months  basic  literacy  and  3  months  post-literacy)  or  10  months  (6  months  basic\nliteracy  and  4  months  post-literacy).  One  project  aimed  at  hard-to-reach  urban  children  provides\ncourses of 24 months duration. Under all programs, classes take place for two hours each day, six\ndays a week, and are timed to allow the learners to continue to work.\n\nMany  NGOs  run  NFE  programs  ranging  from  preschool  education  to  skills-based  training\n13.\nand adult basic education programs. The nonformal primary education program of the Bangladesh\nRural Advancement Committee has an extensive network of close to 40,000 centers serving about\ntwo  million  older  children  who  have  dropped  out  of  primary  school  or  have  never  enrolled.  Other\nNGOs  cater  to  the  needs  of  specific  disadvantaged  groups.  For  instance,  SAPTAGRAM,  the\nSeven  Villages  Women\u2019s  Self-Reliance  Movement,  has  22,000  members  spread  across  900\nvillages in three districts, focusing on continuing education for women.\n\nBasic  literacy  programs  of  DNFE  are  delivered  via  two  main  modes,  the  center-based\n14.\napproach  (CBA)  and  the  total  literacy  movement  (TLM).  There  is  also  a  free  primer  distribution\nprogram  channeled  through  philanthropic  voluntary  organizations.  CBA  programs  to  date  have\nreached 4.7 million learners enrolled in 158,000 learning centers. The programs are delivered by\nselected  NGOs,  contracted  by  DNFE.  More  than  450  NGOs  are  actively  involved  in  these\nprograms. TLM is carried out directly by DNFE. TLM programs have reached 9.3 million learners\nenrolled  in  310,000  centers  to  date.  Under  TLM,  the  whole  community  is  mobilized  through\nextensive  campaigns  to  achieve  full  literacy  in  a  district.  Under  the  deputy  commissioner  of  the\ndistrict,  a  TLM  association  is  formed,  involving  all  sectors  of  society  including  political  leaders.\nDNFE  provides  technical  services  support  and  primers,  and  sends  monitoring  and  fact-finding\nteams  to  each  district  and  subdistricts  (Upazilas).10  Teachers  are  locally  recruited,  educated,\nunemployed men and women who receive a monthly honorarium (currently equivalent to $10).\n\n15.\nThe first NFE project started in 1991 with significant external assistance, which provided 80\npercent of the project cost. Subsequently, the Government\u2019s share in the funding of NFE projects\nincreased steadily and TLM is entirely funded by the Government. The Government\u2019s funding for\nNFE comes from its development budget, with the exception of the salaries of civil servants. Of the\ntotal  funding  of  over  $333  million  for  all  NFE  projects  \u2013  completed,  current,  and  approved  up  to\nMarch  2001  \u2013  the  Government  provided  $167  million  (50  percent),  with  $91  million  (26  percent)\ncoming  from  aid  agency  loans  and  $75  million  (23  percent)  from  aid  agency  grants.  The\nGovernment\u2019s  allocation  of  funding  for  NFE,  as  a  percent  of  the  total  education  budget  and  as  a\npercent  of  GDP,  has  increased  steadily  over  the  last  six  years.  The  cost  per  learner  on  NFE\nliteracy  programs  varies  by  length  of  program  and  by  the  components  provided  (e.g.,  length  of\nteacher training), but the cost per learner is higher for CBA programs (around $12) and lower for\nTLM  programs  ($5).  The  24-month  program  for  hard-to-reach  urban  children  has  significantly\nhigher costs per learner ($43).\n\n                                                \n10 The administrative structure of Bangladesh is defined by six divisions. Each division is divided into districts, which are\nsplit into subdistricts or Upazilas. Unions consist of clusters of villages with some devolved political and administrative\nfunctions.\n\n\f5\n\n4.\n\nMain Issues in Nonformal Education and Continuing Education\n\na. \n\nPolicy Framework and Long-Term Vision\n\n16.\nThe recently approved National Education Policy 2000 (NEP) of the Government has yet to\nbe  translated  into  concrete  policies  and  action  plans  for  the  NFE  subsector.  Operationalizing\nelements  in  the  NEP  \u2013  such  as  increased  private  sector  and  community  participation,  enhanced\nparticipation  of  women,  and  the  extension  of  mass  education  for  the  15-45  age  group  to  include\npost-literacy  and  continuing  education  (PLCE)  \u2013  will  have  significant  consequences  on  a  large\nnumber of subsector planning and development issues. At the regulatory and governance level, full\nimplementation of the NEP may require parliamentary or ministerial actions. At the NFE subsystem\nlevel,  issues  include  matters  of  cost,  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks,  organizational  structure,\nfinancial planning and management, system monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A specific challenge\nis  to  promote  decentralization  and  devolution  of  specific  management  responsibilities,  including\nproviding communities and learners with more control over the design, conduct, and evaluation of\nlearning activities. Systemic, institutional, and operational issues need to be taken into account in\nformulating  sub-sector  strategies,  programs, \nframeworks,  and  coordinated\nimplementation plans.\n\ninvestment \n\n17.\nIn  this  context  and  considering  past  and  current  large-scale  investments  in  basic  literacy\nprograms, a long-term vision is required to ensure the provision of educational opportunities so that\nneo-literates can acquire functional knowledge and skills as well as literacy. Completion of a basic\nliteracy  course  is  insufficient,  and  the  policy  framework  needs  to  include  an  effective  continuing\neducation  system  that  provides  follow-on  post-literacy  and  other  services  to  help  learners  retain,\nimprove,  and  use  the  basic  literacy  skills  in  the  context  of  income-generating  and  community\ndevelopment activities.\n\n18.\nThe  required  policy  framework  and  long-term  vision  also  need  to  reflect  up-to-date\nconceptual  approaches  for  NFE  beyond  the  current  focus  of  the  Government  on  mainly\nquantitative  target  achievement.  The  development  debate  about  literacy  has  undergone  major\nchanges and paradigmatic shifts during the last three decades. Increasingly, illiteracy is being seen\nas  a  structural  social  problem  of  society  instead  of  being  a  social  pathology  and  an  individual\nresponsibility. At the same time, literacy is not a panacea for social development and change, but\nmore  a  prerequisite  for  such  development  and  change.  It  is  therefore  in  the  context  of  broader\neducational  and  socioeconomic  development  when  interventions  focus  on  promoting  learner\ninvolvement in civil society, economic activities, and activities designed to improve living standards.\nThe new understanding of literacy goes beyond the narrow definition of the three \u201cRs\u201d \u2013 reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic. Literacy is defined as having skills to acquire information and skills that can\nimmediately  be  used  to  improve  living  standards  and  generate  income.  To  achieve  these  goals,\nliteracy programs need to respond to individual learner\u2019s needs through flexible provisions.\n\nPLCE, which combines further literacy development, or post-literacy with community- based\n19.\nskills training building on previous courses of basic literacy, requires a systemic approach. It needs\nto integrate different types of training as well as contributions from a variety of stakeholders in the\ncontext of decentralized implementation. Taking into account its limited resources, DNFE will need\nto reallocate capacities currently used for directly implementing NFE programs and concentrate on\npolicy  planning,  information  analysis,  standard  setting,  contract  management,  M&E,  and  overall\nsystem development. Based on a shared vision of NFE, a PLCE system needs to be based on a\nnational  framework  and  a  long-term  plan,  which  overcomes  the  campaign  and  singular  project\napproach of the past. New delivery modes that respond to the diversity of skill requirements with\nwell-targeted  curricula  need  to  be  used.  The  traditional  teaching  role  must  become  one  of\nfacilitation,  and  facilitator  training  must  focus  on  the  demands  of  individual  learners  and\ncommunities instead of  being  centered on schoolmasterish teaching and the provision of training\nas part of a supply-side policy.\n\n\f6\n\nIncreasing  public  expenditures  on  education  cannot  keep  pace  with  the  overall  growing\n20.\nnumber of students. The NFE system currently burdens the Government with increasing financial\ncosts. If PLCE is to move toward a lifelong learning process, it cannot be funded completely by the\nGovernment. Program planning must identify ways of inviting in-kind contributions of beneficiaries,\nincluding learners, employers, communities, and families. Financial sustainability of programs can\nalso be supported by using existing resources (e.g., trainers and the Government line agency field\nstaff)  and  facilities  (training  centers,  buildings  of  private  schools).  The  most  cogent  factor  in\nexpanding NFE to a long-term and joint undertaking of learners, civil society, NGOs, other service\nproviders, and Government is that graduates of the basic literacy program are ready and willing to\nlearn,  as  documented  by  their  substantial  financial  contribution  in  terms  of  forgone  earnings\n(opportunity costs).\n\nb. \n\nQuality and Relevance\n\n21. While Bangladesh has had undeniable success in providing access to NFE, the quality of\nthe  offerings  still  require  substantial  improvement  if  functional  literacy  is  to  be  achieved  and\nsustained. Facing the massive problem of illiteracy in the early 1990s, the Government adopted a\ncampaign  approach  (TLM)  and  the  CBA  approach  to  literacy  training.  Both  entailed  providing\nlearners with a crash program of basic reading and writing together with some \u201clife skills training.\u201d\nThese approaches were appropriate at the time, but there is a danger that neo-literates will slide\nback  into  illiteracy  if  learning  is  not  reinforced.  Also,  basic  literacy  courses  did  not  include  skills\ntraining  that  would  lead  trainees  to  better  income-earning  opportunities.  The  Government  has\nadopted  a  concept  of  literacy  that  uses  the  traditional  \u2018threshold\u2019  measure  of  literacy.  This  views\nliteracy as a discrete characteristic that individuals either possess or do not possess. People are\ndescribed as being functionally literate11 if they have participated in a basic literacy program of the\nGovernment. Such an understanding of literacy is useful where policy makers need a short-term,\nreadily  identifiable  goal  to  aim  for  and  particularly  where  literacy  is  being  introduced  for  the  first\ntime as was the case in Bangladesh several years ago. However, such a measure is not accurate\nor sophisticated in defining the quality of achievement required and in identifying the literacy needs\nof the poor in a diverse social and economic environment. It can offer little illumination about what\nskills  functional  literacy  involves  for  learners  and  those  teaching  them.  There  are  ways  of\nexpanding this functional approach. One is to move toward thinking in terms of a broad range of\nskills rather than a single skill. Literacy is seen as a set of interrelated skills, communication skills,\nlife skills, and social skills. This broad definition is common in many contemporary views of literacy.\n\n22.\nIn  Bangladesh,  the  new  concept  of  PLCE  comprises  both  literacy  and  life  skills  training\ncalled  post-literacy  training,  and  occupational  skills  training,  which  has  been  called  continuing\neducation. It is intended to follow and build on previous basic literacy courses. However, the rapid\nexpansion  of  basic  literacy  programs  has  outrun  the  capacity  of  DNFE  to  focus  on  the  quality  of\ncurricula, materials, and training of trainers as well as to develop new PLCE programs. This raises\na number of critical issues: (i) a gap between basic literacy and continuing education has resulted\nin  loss  of  literacy  skills  in  many  learners;  (ii)  raised  awareness  of  the  importance  of  acquiring\nincome-generating skills created in learners expectations that have not been met; (iii) lack of M&E\nregarding  program  participation,  learning  achievement,  and  quality  of  inputs  makes  it  difficult  to\nbuild  on  previous  and  current  basic  literacy  courses;  (iv)  lack  of  records  of  literacy  levels  and\nstandardization  of  results  hampers  setting  quality  benchmarks  for  PLCE;  (v)  cooperation  and\ncoordination between DNFE and other ministries involved in NFE has not been achieved, and (vi)\n\n                                                \n11 \u201cFunctional literacy\u201d is a common term, but it is used in several distinct ways. A common definition is that someone is\nfunctionally literate if that person is to engage effectively in all those activities in which literacy is normally assumed in\ntheir  culture  or  social  group.  The  importance  of  this  and  similar  definitions,  which  have  been  used  in  international\ndeclarations, is that they make central the idea that literacy is a relative matter, relative to a particular society or group.\n\n\f7\n\nthere  is  a  need  to  use  and  focus  all  available  resources  of  the  country  on  achieving  both  the\nambitious quantitative as well the quality targets.\n\n23.\nDNFE\u2019s cooperation with NGOs has rarely been based on shared quality objectives and a\ncommon  understanding of literacy. Within the NGO community, each organization again appears\nto  have  its  own  vision  of  what  the  members  are  doing  and  there  are  built-in  differences  of\nperspective  and  delivery  quality.  Much  innovative  work,  which  originates  in  practice,  still  goes\nundocumented.  It  may  be  described  in  reports  that  are  circulated  locally,  but  local  curricula  and\nmaterials,  are  unlikely  to  become  part  of  the  resource  of  nationally  available  documents.\nFragmentation  of  resources,  concepts,  and  capacities  is  the  prevailing  picture  of  NFE  in\nBangladesh, effectively restricting the overall quality of NFE. There is therefore a strong rationale\nfor concerted efforts of curriculum and material development and training of trainers on a national\nlevel, which combine some of the best resources of the country.\n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\n24.\n  Although DNFE has been able to achieve its targets on delivery of basic literacy programs,\nits capacity to initiate, supervise, administer, and monitor NFE has been stretched to the maximum\nby  these  ongoing  basic  literacy  projects  and  the  huge  number  of  17  million  learners.  The\nGovernment has adopted a centralized system of planning, program formulation, and monitoring in\nthe management of NFE with a decentralized mode of implementation. DNFE is the largest NFE\nprovider  in  the  country.  It  requires  strengthening  in  core  competencies  such  as  policy  planning,\ncontract  and  subsector  management,  and  in  developing  coordination  mechanisms  with  other\nGovernment  institutions  and  agencies  that  are  currently  involved  in  offering  a  variety  of  skills\ntraining  to  unskilled  learners.  The  most  effective  tool  for  DNFE  to  keep  up  with  its  supervisory\nfunction  is  M&E.  While  costs-per-learner  indicators  exist,  on  learning  achievements  and  other\nimpacts of various past and ongoing NFE projects and campaigns data are lacking.  M&E becomes\neven more an issue once PLCE is regarded as an evolving concept, adjusting to new challenges\nby changing delivery modes and considering a new time horizon for achieving its goals. Demand-\ndriven  interventions  \u2013  building  on  existing  structures  or  programs,  taking  into  account  lessons\nlearned,  and  exploring  diversified  means  and  methods  \u2013  require  management  structures  and\nprocesses  that  permit  good  policy  access,  substantial  authority,  a  high  degree  of  professional\ncompetence,  a  good  management  information  system  (MIS),  improved  planning,  monitoring  and\nreporting  capacity,  and  new  linkages  of  cooperation  between  multiple  stakeholders,  service\nproviders, and actors in the NFE field.   \n\n25.\nDNFE\u2019s  current  roster  lists  about  450  NGOs  of  varying  quality  that  are  eligible  for\nimplementing  NFE  courses.  About  210  NGOs  will  be  required  to  implement  PLCE  courses.  A\nmajority of them have been assessed to have the necessary management and human resources\ncapacities to implement such programs. The other NGOs require substantial staff development for\nthem  to  play  their  role  successfully  within  a  new  PLCE  framework.  Forming  consortia  between\nmore experienced and efficiently managed NGOs and smaller local NGOs could be instrumental in\nhelping the latter to learn on the job and grow professionally. Thus, a potential shortage of qualified\nNGOs  could  be  avoided.  Forming  consortia  among  NGOs  could  also  help  overcome  the  existing\nfragmentation  of  professional  knowledge,  which  is  particularly  felt  in  the  area  of  core  curricula,\nteaching materials, and training of trainers.\n\nRecent  developments  in  the  education  sector  in  Bangladesh  include  the  approval  of  NEP12\n26.\nand the establishment of a National Education Policy Implementation Cell to operationalize the new\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n                                                \n12 Approved by the Government in October 2000.\n\n\f8\n\npolicy. Work is ongoing to prepare a revised plan of action for Education for All by the end of 2001. In\nthe  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  aim  of  the  Government  is  stated  as  \u201cdecentralization  for  program\nplanning, strategy formulation and resource mobilization and encouraging local level participation\nwith ownership in planning and implementation.\u201d The Government is considering the organization of\na multiyear, sector-wide, long-range planning process that will involve PMED, Ministry of Education,\nMinistry of Finance, Planning Commission, Ministry of Establishment, and other relevant ministries,\nindependent government institutions, and private organizations in a dialogue on matters pertaining to\neducation sector restructuring.\n\nGiven the overwhelming number of illiterates and the breadth of poverty in the country, NFE\n27.\nand  specifically  literacy  training,  has  become  a  high  priority  of  the  Government.  NEP  specifically\nrecognizes the need for continuous training to ensure that learning is reinforced. NEP emphasizes\nthe  need  for  partnerships  with  NGOs  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  training  programs.  In  the\ncontext of the national commitment to the goal of education for all and to complement its work in\nprimary education, the Government is currently supporting substantial investments in basic literacy.\nAs  a  signatory  to  the  Jomtien  Declaration,  Bangladesh  committed  itself  to  achieve  62  percent\nliteracy by 2000 \u2013 which it accomplished \u2013 and to realize full literacy by 2006. DNFE is currently\nengaged in implementing four literacy projects for an estimated target population of 34.5 million. So\nfar, 6 of 64 districts in the country have been declared to have achieved full literacy, and altogether\n17  million  illiterates  have  been  exposed  to  basic  literacy  courses.  This  success  is  mirrored  in  a\nliteracy rate that has increased from 35 percent in 1991 to an estimated 64 percent in 2001.\n\n28.\nNEP advocates a shift in DNFE\u2019s role from a focus on implementing basic literacy programs\nto a coordinating function in PLCE. NEP states, \u201cto do this the Directorate of Nonformal Education\nwill be turned into an institution of Continuing Education and Skill Development.\u201d This fundamental\nshift calls for a coordinated approach by the Government, NGOs, and civil society and emphasizes\nthat  \u201cthe  duration,  subject,  teaching  and  learning  methods,  the  qualification  of  teachers  and  the\nlearning  process  will  be  determined  by  the  needs  of  the  local  people,  and  the  availability  of\nresources.\u201d As part of the concerted efforts, \u201cnation building\u201d (training and extension) departments\nof  various  ministries  (e.g.,  fisheries,  women  and  children,  health,  agriculture)  are  supposed  to\ncontribute  to  PLCE  programs.  They  are  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  national  plan  for  social\ndevelopment  and  have  officers  at  Upazila  level  who  have  been  involved  in  the  mass  literacy\ncampaign and also in skills training and microcredit activities.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n29.\nThe  Government  has  received  substantial  external  funding  for  projects  in  the  education\nsector. In the NFE subsector, various funding agencies and the Government to date have funded\nfive major projects with a total cost of $295 million. The Integrated Non-Formal Education Program\nstarted  in  1991  and  was  cofinanced  by  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation\nAgency  (Sida),  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD),  UNDP,  and  the\nInternational  Development\nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF).  Together  with \nAssociation (IDA) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), ADB financed\nNFEP-1,  which  targeted  young  adults  in  the  15-24  years  age  group  and  established  DNFE  as  a\ncoordinating agency. The project started on 1 January 1996 and ended in June 2001 after it had\nprovided basic literacy training to 2.54 million adult learners. At about the same time NORAD, Sida,\nand  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  financed  NFEP-2  focusing\non the 11-45 years age group. To complement these efforts in basic literacy, the United Kingdom\u2019s\nDepartment For International Development (DFID), UNICEF, and Sida are funding a NFE project\n(NFEP-3) for hard-to-reach urban children. The project provides nonformal basic education for over\n350,000 children of the 8-14 age group, who have not had access to basic schooling and who are\nengaged  in  hazardous  jobs  that  exploit  child  labor.  The  biggest  effort  was  made  by  the\nGovernment  in  terms  of  the  TLM,  which  started  in  April  1997  as  NFEP-4  at  a  total  cost  of  $120\n\nthe \n\n\f9\n\nmillion.  All these projects have contributed to the exposure of 17 million learners to basic literacy\nprograms.\n\n30.\n Other funding agencies are involved in NFE projects through other Government ministries,\nincluding a UNDP-supported NFE project via the Ministry of Social Welfare, a project funded by the\nUnited  States  Department  of  Labor,  two  projects  supported  by  the  International  Labour\nOrganization,  and  one  project  funded  by  the  Dutch  Government.  The  Japanese  International\nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  has  funded  a  study  on  the  creation  of  a  national  academy  for\nnonformal education (NANFE) and provides technical assistance to DNFE. In 2000, DNFE began\nexploring  implementation  modes  for  PLCE  training  by  selecting  23  NGOs  to  pilot  projects  lasting\nfor one year in 21 Upazilas and in 20 districts. The final report for these projects became available\nin June 2001 and gave important lessons for the proposed Project (see paras. 37 and 38). Latest\ninformation suggests that these pilots will be extended and continued. If so, and if started promptly,\nthen the additional lessons learned will further inform the proposed Project.\n\n31.\nTo a varying degree these projects have suffered from lack of focus on program quality and\neffectiveness.  However,  they  have  laid  the  groundwork  for  a  huge  and  internationally  recognized\nliteracy movement in the country. Some of the NGOs in Bangladesh, which are contracted to run\nthe  Government-managed  programs  also  independently,  offer  an  extensive  range  of  NFE.    Over\n400  of  these  NGOs  are  members  of  a  coalition  headed  by  the  Campaign  for  Popular  Education.\nThe  combined  efforts  of  the  Government  and  independent  efforts  of  NGOs  have  helped\nBangladesh demonstrate progress against the international development targets, most notably the\neducation-for-all target to reduce adult illiteracy.  Furthermore, the programs thus far provided by\nthe  Government,  together  with  new  pilots  and  new  programs  in  continuing  education  and  post-\nliteracy, are forming the basis for achieving a clearer national policy and strategy for NFE, and its\nrelationship to formal education in Bangladesh.\n\n32.\nThe Government, IDA ($50 million), and SDC ($6.5 million) are funding a new Post-literacy\nand  Continuing  Education  for  Human  Development  Project  (PLCEHDP-1),  which  started  in  June\n2001  and  covers  32  of  a  total  of  64  districts.  The  design  of  PLCEHDP-1  anticipates  adjustments\nduring the phased introduction of activities based on the results of the 23 pilot projects, which were\npublished after the IDA loan became effective.13 The Government has requested ADB to support a\ncomplementary  project14  to  cover  the  remaining  districts  to  ensure  nationwide  coverage  of  PLCE\nprograms. Both development banks have intensified the coordination of their country operations, which\nhas  helped  to  prepare  the  proposed  Project  in  a  complementary  manner.  The  commitment  of\ncofinancing partners indicates broad support from development partners to implement PLCE programs.\nFurther details of external assistance to NFE are summarized in Appendix 2.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n33.\nIn  assessing  the  many  lessons  learned  in  the  context  of  ADB-supported  education\nprojects,15 lack of monitoring has proved to be a key issue resulting in delayed implementation, low\nquality, and weakened impact of project results. Installing a monitoring system that also provides\nreal-time  feedback  to  the  project  management  allowing  corrective  action  in  midstream  is\nparamount in strengthening project implementation. The existing MIS system of DNFE collects only\nroutine administrative data; it is overloaded and unable to cope with the data generated by basic\nliteracy  courses.  Monitoring  learning  achievements  and  careful  evaluations  that  identify  project\n\n                                                \n13 While goal, purpose, and major components of the proposed Project will be similar or complementary to PLCEHDP-1,\n\nit will differ in implementation mechanisms and its distinct PLCE approach.\n\n14 The Government wants the Project to cover the remaining 29 districts except the three Chittagong Hill Tracts districts,\nwhich  are  still  at  an  early  stage  of  basic  literacy  program  implementation.  Urban  Upazilas  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong\ndistricts are dealt within special projects due to specific beneficiary needs.\n\n15 ADB. 2001. Breaking the Cycle of Poverty through Education. Operations Evaluation Office, Manila.\n\n\f10\n\nimpact and the positive aspects of changes require additional efforts of continuous M&E outside of\nthe routine administration.\n\n34.\nThe  draft  project  performance  audit  report  (PPAR)  of  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Training\nProject, which was approved on 13 December 1990 and completed in December 1997, indicates\nthat  the  focus  on  classroom  teaching  and  lack  of  learners\u2019  participation  in  course  selection\nseriously  affected  the  quality  and  relevance  of  the  livelihood  training  provided  to  70,000\nbeneficiaries.  The  PPAR  also  highlights  the  difficulties  of  the  Government  in  operating  and\nmaintaining  training  facilities  provided  by  the  project.  Findings  from  the  participant  survey  of  the\nADB-supported  NFE  project  on  the  Philippines  (PNFEP)  suggest  that  NFE  programs  have  been\nmost  successful  where  implementing  NGOs  are  tightly  linked  with  the  local  community,  are\nengaged  in  active  dialogue  and  collaboration  with  other  local  institutions,  and  can  respond  with\nflexibility to local needs and constraints in program delivery and content.\n\n35.\nLessons learned from the ADB-supported NFEP-1 in Bangladesh confirm the findings about\nthe  importance  of  local  participation  and  ownership.  Other  lessons  point  to  the  need  for  efficient\nand  effective  financial  management,  including  efficient  procurement  of  services  and  goods.  The\nTA\u2019s  final  report  on  the  project16  emphasizes  that  DNFE  needs  to  better  focus  its  existing\ncapacities to be able to expand targets and implement additional projects. Of particular concern is\nthe  capacity  of  current  systems  to  understand  quality  in  terms  of  significance,  methodology,  and\nbenefits;  and  to  maintain  agreed-upon  quality  standards.  These  lessons  have  led  to  a\nreassessment  of  DNFE\u2019s  role  regarding  new  PLCE  programs.  Strengthening  its  supervisory  and\nregulatory functions while contracting out program implementation and related support functions to\nprivate sector organizations including NGOs has become justifiable.\n\nThe first tracer study carried out by the NFEP-1 surveyed 1,480 NFE graduates (82 percent\n36.\nof  them  women  with  75  percent  in  the  14-25  age  group).  The  study  concluded  that  learners\u2019\nincreased  participation  in  economic  activities,  loan  seeking  behavior,  more  active  participation  in\ncommunity groups as well as commitment to sending their children to school and using birth control\nmethods  demonstrate  the  impact  of  basic  literacy  programs.  Such  newly  learned  skills  and\nattitudes are endangered if there is no follow-up program that can sustain these efforts to break the\npoverty  cycle.  The  tracer  study\u2019s  finding  underlines  the  importance  of  training  teachers  to  act  as\nfacilitators  rather  than  directors  of  learning,  applying  instructional  methods  that  attract  and  retain\nlearners,  breaking  the  learners\u2019  group  into  smaller  activity  groups,  and  using  carefully  selected\nreading and teaching materials.\n\nAn evaluation17 of the first PLCE pilot projects in Bangladesh, funded by Sida and NORAD,\n37.\nhighlights  many  important  lessons.  At  a  strategic  level,  the  evaluation  argues  for  a  concise  NFE\npolicy that addresses peoples\u2019 needs and which is translated into precise strategies and plans. The\nreport noted that in many cases, the implementing NGO staff \u2013 including the facilitators and skills\ntrainers  \u2013  had  insufficient  understanding  of  (i)  their  roles  and  responsibilities;  (ii)  demand-led,\ncommunity-owned  approaches  to  continuing  education;  and  (iii)  managing  and  motivating  groups\nof  adult  learners  having  widely  varying  levels  of  basic  literacy,  aspiration,  and  confidence.  These\nfindings  highlight  the  importance  of  giving  appropriate  and  high-quality  training  to  the  facilitators\nand  the  implementing  NGO  supervisors,  and  of  ensuring  that  they  are  provided  with,  and\ncontribute  to,  job  descriptions  that  are  clear  and  realistic.  The  study  noted  that  the  lack  of\nrelevance of post-literacy as part of a static three months post-literacy plus six months continuing\neducation  course  schedule  discouraged  many  learners.  These  findings  may  also  influence\n                                                \n16 The  Final  TA  Report  for  TA  2534\u2013BAN:  Institutional Development of the Directorate of Nonformal Education  was\nsubmitted  on  15  June  2001;  the  draft  Project  Performance  Audit  Report  (PPAR)  of  the Rural Training Project  (Loan\n1066-BAN[SF])  is  dated  17  September  2001;  Findings of the Participant/Non-participant Survey of  the  Philippines\nNonformal Education Project (PNFEP, ADB-Loan No. 1254-PHI[SF])  are dated 14 March 2001.\n\n17 PMED/DNFE.  2001.  Final  Report  on  the  Evaluation  of  the  Post-Literacy  and  Continuing  Education  Pilot  Program.\n\nDhaka.\n\n\f11\n\nadjustments  on  the  IDA/SDC-supported  PLCEHDP-1  design,  which  has  adopted  the  same\napproach, and could finally lead to a more seamless integration of both types of training in all new\nPLCE programs.\n\nThe  evaluation  report  emphasizes \n\n38.\nimportance  of  having  center  management\nthe \ncommittees  (CMCs)  that  take  an  active  role  in  program  delivery.  The  findings  suggest  that  the\ncommittee  must  assist  in  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  center  and  steer18\ncenter  operations  so  as  to  maximize  benefits  for  the  community.  Referring  to  vocational  skills\ndevelopment,  the  evaluation  report  noted  that  particular  kinds  of  skills  training  should  be  offered\nonly,  if  there  are  identified  gaps  in  the  market  for  the  kind  of  skill  in  question.  It  stressed  that\nrigorous  labor  market  and  income-generating  opportunity  studies  should  be  carried  out  by  the\nimplementing NGOs (INGOs), in collaboration with the local community, before any skills training is\noffered.  The  evaluation  highlighted  the  need  for  providing  continuing  education  to  address  more\nfully  the  issue  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  market  activities,  and  of  identifying  and  attempting  to\novercome the barriers they face - should they wish - to engage in nontraditional work that is more\nremunerative.  As  the  findings  imply,  this  is  a  complex  issue  relating  to  such  things  as  the  time\navailable for women to engage in income-generating activities, absence of child care, development\nof  personal  attributes  such  as  knowledge  and  confidence,  cultural  norms  in  rural  areas,  and\nattitudes as to what constitutes women\u2019s work. The evaluation suggests that special attention at all\nlevels  should  be  given  to  the  issue,  but  particularly  at  community  level,  and  that  facilitators,\nprogram supervisors, and skills trainers, both female and male, can be exposed to the issue during\ntraining and, wherever possible, appropriate course delivery strategies can be introduced.\n\nADB\u2019s  sector  study  on  NFE19  in  Bangladesh  confirms  these  findings  and  emphasize  the\n39.\nneed to consolidate the literacy programs in the context of learning income-generating skills. The\nsector study also stressed that communities have demonstrated their willingness to contribute in kind to\nthe success of training activities by working to renovate and upgrade existing facilities and by providing\nsome  of  the  resources,  e.g.,  sitting  mats.  There  is  evidence  that  participants  of  NFE  activities  are\nprepared to contribute to reducing the cost of training that they perceive as creating income-enhancing\nopportunities.\n\n40.\nDuring  the  preparation  of  the  proposed  Project,  close  consultation  with  other  development\npartners assured learning from previous experience. It is important that this close consultation among\ndevelopment partners continue during the implementation of various projects in the subsector to ensure\nclose coordination.  The proposed Project provides a platform for such coordination in terms of annual\nsector review workshops.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n41.\nConsistent  with  the  Government's  medium-term  development  strategy,  ADB's  country\noperational  strategy  (COS)  for  Bangladesh,  which  was  finalized  in  1999,  identified  poverty\nreduction  as  its  overall  strategic  objective.    To  achieve  this  objective,  three  priority  areas  are\ntargeted:  (i)  promoting  faster  private-sector-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  creating  better  development\nopportunities  for  the  poor  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  (iii)  promoting  human  development  and\nenvironmental protection.  In the field of human development, ADB's long-term operational focus is\non basic formal education (primary and secondary) and NFE as well as urban primary health care.\nADB's operational strategy for the education sector aims at (i) increasing equitable access to basic\neducation,  particularly  for  girls  and  disadvantaged  children;  (ii)  improving  education  quality  and\nsystem  efficiency,  particularly  in  teacher  training;  (iii)  strengthening  the  institutional  and\n\n                                                \n18  Regular  meetings  should  take  place  to  address  learning  program  quality,  course  delivery  mechanisms,  and  the\nlearners\u2019  and  community\u2019s  concerns.  Minutes  of  such  meetings  would  then  be  available  as  a  monitoring  instrument\nallowing prompt community-level corrective action to be taken.\n\n19 Concluded under TA 3465-BAN: Second Nonformal Education Project, footnote 1.\n\n\f12\n\nmanagement  capacities  to  deliver  basic  education;  and  (iv)  supporting  decentralization  and\ncommunity involvement in education.\n\n42.\nDuring the last decade, ADB assistance to the education sector in Bangladesh has focused\non basic education, including primary and nonformal education, and secondary education. In April\n2000, a partnership agreement on poverty reduction (PAPR) was signed by the Government and\nADB.  The  PAPR  formalizes  the  agreement  that  development  cooperation  will  be  guided  by  the\noverarching  objective  of  reducing  poverty.  Under  this  agreement,  the  Government\u2019s  long  term\nvision  includes  efforts  to  achieve  the  targets  set  under  the  international  development  goals\nestablished through a series of world summit meetings in the 1990s. In particular, the Government\nwill strive to achieve universal primary education by 2010 and total literacy by 2006. ADB\u2019s Country\nStrategy  and  Program  (CSP)  update  of  July  2001  confirms  that  priority  for  human  development\nprojects is in areas that can increase the productivity of the poor.\n\n43.\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  COS,  PAPR,  and  CSP  in  that  it  aims  at  reducing  poverty\nthrough human development by improving access, quality, and sustainability of NFE.  The Project\nwill  focus  on  improving  literacy  in  a  broader  context  of  continuing  education  that  will  embrace\ndevelopment of skills that will generate income for the poor.  Moreover, the Project is expected to\nhelp achieve the goal of eradicating national illiteracy by 2006.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n44.\nPolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  focused  on  three  key  areas:  (i)  the  need  to\ndevelop an appropriate policy framework and action plans; (ii) the need to improve the quality and\nrelevance of PLCE, and (iii) the need to build capacity for emerging roles in the context of public-\nprivate partnership (PPP). A summary of the policy dialogue follows.\n\n1.\n\nPolicy Framework and Action Plan\n\nThe Government recognizes the need for a national policy framework for NFE, in particular\n45.\nfor PLCE, to implement NEP. The policy framework for PLCE should therefore include all potential\nlearners,  including  school  dropouts  who  have  not  participated  in  basic  literacy  programs.  The\nPMED has agreed to develop a long-term action plan, including financial budgets, by the end of the\nsecond year of project implementation, which will consider the issue of inclusiveness. Apart from\ninclusiveness,  a  unified  PLCE  approach  based  on  experience  gained  in  ongoing  and  previous\nprojects is another key ingredient for the policy framework as PLCE is a relatively new form of NFE\nin  Bangladesh.  A  major  challenge  for  the  Government  in  the  development  of  the  new  policy\nframework is developing PLCE models that respond to the diverse needs of learners and flexible\ntraining  modules  to  meet  these  diverse  needs.  The  approaches  involve  the  establishment  of\nenhanced  PPP,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  coordinated  and  more  efficient  use  of  available\nresources.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  use  the  specialized  services  of  the  private  consulting\nsector in Bangladesh, which will supplement the input of other institutions \u2013 DNFE and NGOs \u2013 for\nM&E  of  the  proposed  Project.  Another  crucial\u2013and  debated\u2013element  of  the  policy  framework  is\nbeneficiary  contribution  to  help  shoulder  the  increasing  costs  of  NFE.  Currently,  the  Government\nprovides basic literacy courses free of cost to recipients on the ground that poor people are unable\nto pay. However, learners make real contributions in kind, both in terms of providing practical work\nin  maintaining  NFE  centers  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  income  forgone.  The  latter  represents  a\nmajor cost for participants many of whom live at subsistence level. It was agreed that contributions\nin kind from beneficiaries and communities need to be further encouraged to reduce overall costs.\nFor this to occur, PLCE courses must meet the needs of the learners. The Government will review\nthis issue, and the envisaged action plan of DNFE will take into account community contributions in\nkind.\n\n\f2.\n\nImproving the Quality and Relevance of PLCE\n\n13\n\n 46.\n One of the central thrusts of the Project is to improve training through high-quality curricula\nand  materials,  and  a  better  trained  teaching  force.  For  PLCE  programs,  the  quality  of  learner\nfacilitation,  curriculum  model,  content  and  delivery  become  the  most  critical  factor.  The\nGovernment  has  followed  a  rigid  approach  of  three  months\u2019  post-literacy  training  followed  by  six\nmonths  of  continuing  education.  Such  an  approach  has  proved  to  be  an  obstacle  to  learners\u2019\nmotivation  in  the  23  pilot  projects  financed  by  NORAD  and  Sida.  The  challenge  of  an  integrated\napproach is to design and implement tailor-made vocational skills\u2019 training that integrates literacy\nskills  development  seamlessly.  Only  an  integrated  approach  can  overcome  the  problem  of\ndiminishing motivation. The pilot projects found that learner motivation was highly correlated with\nthe  promise  of  skills  training  and  the  perceived  subsequent  improvement  in  livelihoods.  Tapping\nthis  motivation  early  in  the  learning  cycle  by  allowing  individuals  and  small  groups  to  engage  in\nskills training as soon as the basic minimum literacy requirement for engaging in that skill has been\nachieved is crucial. The Government has agreed to try out a more flexible approach of combining\nPLCE in the proposed Project as long as the proportion of one third post-literacy training and two\nthirds  continuing  education  is  kept.    It  was  also  agreed  that  a  national  task  force  of  NGOs  and\ntraining  specialists  will  prepare  curricula  and  material,  and  conduct  training  of  trainers.  This  will\neffectively combine the best talents and resource persons of the country. The task force will review\ncurricula and materials every year. It is also accepted that the PLCE program must respond to the\nneeds  of  local  communities.  These  needs  will  be  identified  through  extensive  dialogue  with  the\ncommunities and potential beneficiaries, via CMCs, and supported by comprehensive information\non income-generating opportunities.\n\n47.\nPolicy dialogue also led to an agreement that rigorous M&E is needed to ensure quality in\ndelivering PLCE. This entails monitoring of targets and the quality of courses in terms of learning\nachievement  and  curricular  assessment.  DNFE\u2019s  demand  for  enhanced  monitoring,  including\nperformance  monitoring,  indicates  the  Government  desire  to  improve  on  previous  projects.  For\nexample, under the NFEP-1, a tenfold increase in the planned number of learners in the course of\nproject implementation brought into focus the issue of learning achievement and program quality.\nQuality of program delivery and content will also be influenced by gender- related factors. A tracer\nstudy  of  the  same  project  showed  that  increased  participation  of  women  in  NFE  has  a  strong\nimpact on the social and economic condition of families. The Government recognizes the need for\ngreater  representation  of  women  in  planning,  delivering,  and  participating  in  PLCE  programs.  It\nsupports  the  development  of  gender  action  plans  and  is  committed  to  implementing  current\nGovernment gender policies.\n\n3.\n\nCapacity Building\n\n48.\nFollowing  the  guidelines  of  the  NEP,  the  Government  recognizes  the  need  for  better\ncoordination between ministries and agencies and to rely more on private sector organizations and\ncivil  society  in  decentralized  implementation  of  NFE.  PLCE  necessitates  a  structured  and  well-\ndesigned program based on broad support from a variety of actors for achieving social objectives\nand  poverty  reduction.  Dialogue  with  PMED  and  DNFE  officials  has  led  to  an  agreement  on  the\nimportance of building the organizational capacity of NGOs, private sector organizations, and civil\nsociety  groups  like  CMCs  to  take  on  increased  responsibility  for  PLCE  programs.  DNFE  and  the\nimplementing and monitoring organizations need to gradually assume new roles in the context of\nPPP. It was agreed that capacity building for training is an essential input of the Project. Another\nkey  input  for  capacity  building  is  effective  leadership.  Leadership  from  the  Government  requires\nsetting the policy agenda, enforcing regulations in a transparent manner, and removing barriers to\nlearning  without  being  directly  involved  in  implementing  training  programs.  Leadership  in  the\nprivate  sector  demands  active  coordination  among  participating  organizations  and \nthe\nestablishment of a code of conduct or a system of accreditation for quality assurance.\n\n\f14\n\n49.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  agreed  that  consortia  of  local  NGOs  under  the  guidance  of  a\nleading  NGO  will  be  tested  as  one  of  the  delivery  modes  for  implementing  PLCE  courses.  Such\ngroupings  can  overcome  fragmentation  of  available  resources  and  help  improve  the  capability  of\nparticipating  NGOs  through  on-the-job  training  and  sharing  of  resources.  It  was  agreed  that  the\nNGOs  and  private  firms  must  meet  the  criteria  laid  down  for  participation  (Appendix  3).  These\ncriteria  will  also  be  used  for  monitoring  the  performance  of  the  implementing  and  monitoring\nagencies.  The  Government  and  ADB  agreed  that  INGOs  will  be  selected  based  on  action  plans\nproposed  by  them.  Approval  of  the  plans  will  be  a  condition  for  continued  funding  after  an  initial\nyear  of  probation.  There  was  consensus  that  an  assessment  of  management  capacities  of\npotential partner agencies, conducted by DFID before the start of the Project, will allow the Project\nto develop well-targeted capacity-building activities.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  illiteracy  and  lack  of  life  skills  are  a  major  factor\n50.\ncontributing  to  rural  poverty.    Illiterates  are  unable  to  participate  in  the  employment  opportunities\nemerging from economic growth, cannot participate in civil society, and, still worse, perpetuate the\ncycle  of  poverty  by  failing  to  provide  their  children  with  educational  opportunities.  Despite  recent\nstrong  performance  in  improving  access  to  basic  education  for  children,  millions  of  adults  either\nmissed  the  chance  to  attend  school  altogether  or  dropped  out  after  a  few  years  of  school  and\nremain  functionally  illiterate.  Since  1991  the  Government  has  exerted  major  efforts  to  eradicate\nilliteracy through several projects and the establishment of DNFE in 1995.  Since then DNFE has\nfunded  literacy  training  for  17  million  learners  mainly  through  community-supported  centers  and\nwith  the  assistance  of  NGOs.  Evaluations  of  DNFE  literacy  programs  show  that  learners  acquire\nsignificant  new  skills  and  develop  more  progressive  social  attitudes,  e.g.,  greater  participation  in\neconomic  activities,  enhanced  ability  to  access  and  use  micro-credit,  more  active  participation  in\ncivil  society,  and  greater  propensity  to  send  their  children  to  school  and  to  regulate  their  fertility.\nHowever,  the  neo-literate  graduates  of  these  early  programs  require  further  training  to  reinforce\ntheir  new  skills  and  to  acquire  a  new  set  of  skills  aimed  at  improving  their  employability  and\nbreaking the cycle of poverty. Appropriate curricula and trained facilitators are required to train an\nestimated  1.6  million  learners  and  thus  provide  opportunities  for  them  to  directly  apply  newly\nacquired literacy skills, and prepare them for income-generating activities. The Project will support\nand expand DNFE\u2019s mandate to provide a comprehensive range of PLCE courses to neo-literates.\nIt will develop curricula and materials as well as train trainers to implement these courses.\n\n51.\nNGOs  of  various  sizes,  with  a  diversity  of  mandates,  funded  by  the  Government;  and\nexternal  agencies  and  other  sources  have  successfully  conducted  a  variety  of  basic  literacy\nprograms  in  the  past.  Given  this  vast  though  organizationally  fragmented  experience  and\nconsidering  limited  implementation  capacities,  the  Project  promotes  partnerships  among  private\nsector  organizations  and  with  the  Government,  based  on  shared  objectives,  concepts,  and  joint\nmonitoring and implementation as part of a new policy framework and long-term vision for PLCE.\nThe  Project  encourages  consortia  between  leading  NGOs  and  smaller  NGOs  to  achieve\nknowledge and technology transfer and capacity building. PLCE courses have to build on previous\nbasic  literacy  efforts  of  about  17  million  learners  in  Bangladesh.  The  political  duty  of  the\nGovernment  to  provide  NFE  activities  evenly  throughout  the  country  with  limited  resources\nnecessitates coverage of 29 selected districts and 210 Upazilas, which will be targeted mainly on a\nfirst completed (basic literacy) \u2013 first served (by PLCE) basis, complemented by learners who have\nonly recently completed a course. The PLCEHDP-1 of the Government follows the same rule for\nthe remaining 32 districts of the country, while three Chittagong Hill districts and urban Upazilas of\nDhaka and Chittagong are covered by special projects due to specific beneficiary needs.\n\n\fB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n15\n\n52.\nThe Project\u2019s long-term sector objective is to help reduce rural poverty through investments\nin  human  development  aimed  at  empowering  the  rural  poor  by  providing  them  with  literacy,  life\nskills, and income-generating skills. The Project aims to establish a community-based and needs-\noriented  PLCE  course  program  and  a  supporting  organizational  framework  for  1.6  million  neo-\nliterates in 29 districts.\n\n53.\nThe Project will be implemented in a phased manner with a comprehensive review at the\nend  of  the  second  year,  which  will  finally  determine  the  implementation  mechanisms  and  the\nteaching  approach.  Preparing  teachers  and  curricula  before  implementing  courses  in  a  limited\nnumber  of  Upazilas,  and  gradually  increasing  the  number  of  learners  while  continuously\nstrengthening monitoring, curricula and materials development, and training of trainers reflect the\nquality focus of the project approach. Continuous feedback and evaluation of results will be used to\nguide  the  project  throughout  implementation.  The  Project  will  promote  the  active  involvement  of\nlearners  and  communities  in  course  planning  and,  where  appropriate,  will  use  information  and\ncommunication technology for efficient implementation. Developing and implementing new modes\nfor delivering PLCE will provide essential inputs for a national framework for NFE.  The Project\u2019s\nobjectives  will  be  achieved  through  four  components:  (i)  policy  framework  development  for  NFE\nbased  on  decentralized  implementation  and  learners\u2019  participation  in  planning;  (ii)  curricula  and\nmaterials development and dissemination for PLCE programs to lay the groundwork for the Project\nand  for  similar  future  activities;  (iii)  capacity  building  for  organizations  involved  in  project\nimplementation  and  strengthening  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  functions  of  Government;  (iv)\ndelivery  of  PLCE  courses  targeting  more  than  1.6  million  learners  who  will  participate  in  courses\norganized by the Project in 29 districts of Bangladesh (Appendix 1). While the last two components\nrelate  to  the  210  Upazilas  where  the  Project  will  provide  services,  contributions  to  the  policy\nframework and to curriculum development and training of trainers will be sector-wide. Details of the\nproject components are described as follows.\n\n1.\n\nPolicy Framework Development (Component 1)\n\n54.\nThis  component  aims  to  develop  a  policy  framework  conducive  to  a  flexible,  responsive,\nand sustainable program of PLCE.  The Project will provide technical expertise and opportunities\nfor public and private stakeholders to collaborate in contributing to a policy framework, which will\nbe part of a long-term vision for PLCE. It will be based on the Government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year-Plan\n(2002\u20132007) and on foundation work done by the PLCEHDP-1, which has the lead in developing a\nnational  framework  with  the  goal  of  strengthening  the  NFE  subsector  of  education.  The  project\ncontributions  to  PLCE  will  focus  on  organizational  \u2013  including  development  of  regulations  \u2013\nmanagement,  and  implementation  arrangements  conducive  to  a  new  concept  of  PLCE  based  on\nincreased  PPP.  PLCE  can  only  be  successful  if  it  becomes  a  long-term  and  joint  undertaking  of\nlearners,  civil  society,  private  sector  organizations,  and  the  Government.  Ultimately,  this\npartnership  may  lead  to  sharing  of  costs  by  the  private  sector  and  beneficiaries.  In  a  continuing\nand evolving process, the Project will demonstrate how PLCE needs to be implemented so as to\nsupport  national  objectives  like  education  for  all,  the  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  and  objectives  of\nNFE  as  stipulated  by  the  NEP.  In  particular,  linkages  and  the  division  of  work  between  actors  of\npublic  agencies,  NGOs,  private  sector  organizations,  and  community-based  organizations  like\nCMCs will be strengthened based on the principle of PPP. The institutional setting of PLCE will be\nsupported  by  the  elaboration  of  appropriate  rules  and  regulations  that  define  coordination\nmechanisms, financial contributions, as well as tasks and responsibilities of PLCE stakeholders at\nnational, district, Upazila, and community levels. The Project will provide expertise to work out in\ndetail a pedagogical concept of PLCE that integrates PLCE in a manner that motivates learners to\nregularly  attend  courses.  The  Project  will  also  support  impact  evaluation  studies  providing\nfeedback  for  further  adjustment  of  the  chosen  PLCE  concept,  and  on  the  extent  of  poverty\nreduction.    In  addition  to  the  clear  articulation  of  the  PLCE  concept,  the  definition  of  tools  and\n\n\f16\n\nmechanisms  for  quality  assurance  will  constitute  an  important  element  of  the  framework.  Annual\nplanning  workshops  as  well  as  Project-related  coordination  meetings  at  district,  Upazila,  and\ncommunity levels will help to elaborate the multitude of elements of the policy framework, involving\nall stakeholders of PLCE programs.\n\n2.\n\nDevelopment, Dissemination, and Adaptation of Curricula for PLCE Programs\n(Component 2)\n\n55.\nThe purpose of this component 2 is to establish and test a wide range of core curricula to\nbe used by INGOs for PLCE courses. At the community level, such core curricula will need to be\ncomplemented to varying degrees by facilitators (teachers) so as to guarantee meaningfulness for\nlearners  and  responsiveness  to  local  conditions.  The  demand-based  approach  to  the  delivery  of\nPLCE  services  requires  INGOs  to  conduct  an  income-generating-opportunity  survey,  which  will\nallow  learners  to  make  informed  decisions  about  the  kind  of  skills  training  they  want  considering\ntheir choice from a range of proposed trades for a specific area. This survey will explore new skills\nand  emerging  opportunities  for  income  generation,  including  higher  yielding  occupations  for\nwomen.  Thus  the  selected  approach  to  curricula  development  combines  the  advantages  of  the\ndevelopment and mass replication of standardized core curricula at the national level with tailoring\ncourses  to  specific  local  conditions  and  to  specific  groups  of  learners.  The  achieved  flexibility  is\nessential, given the consensus that neo-literates continue to use and improve their skills only when\nthere is an economic or social incentive to do so.\n\n56.\nThe PLCE system as envisaged by the Project will require the development of curricula and\nlearning materials that cover a diversity of income-enhancing activities as well as training of master\ntrainers  to  make  them  familiar  with  a  new,  learner-centered  approach  to  NFE.  To  overcome  the\nexisting  fragmentation  of  specialized  professional  resources  in  the  country,  the  Project  will  invite\nproposals  from  both  NGOs  and  private  consulting  companies  to  form  a  national  task  force  for\ncurriculum and  material development and training of trainers. The task force will collect, analyze,\nand review existing curricula and materials. It is expected that the big national NGOs will volunteer\nto contribute to curriculum and materials development without being contracted. Curricula writers\u2019\nworkshops will gather the country\u2019s best resource persons for developing the core curricula based\non a modular approach. Such curricula will allow flexible use according to learners\u2019 needs and local\nrequirements.  The  curricula  will  contain  assessment  formats  and  tests  to  measure  learning\nachievement. Emphasis will be on trades related to local wage employment, self-employment, and\nother  income-generating  activities  demanded  by  learners  and  informed  by  surveys.  Demanded\ntopics like health, nutrition, and family planning as well as modules on literacy and numeracy skills\nwill serve the objective of allowing learners to become more confident in taking their life into their\nown hands and participate more actively in activities of their community.\n\n57.\nThe  Project  will  provide  international  and  local  assistance  for  curriculum  developers  to\nemploy a method for analyzing occupational competencies related to certain trades and to develop\ncompetency-based approaches for assessing learning achievement, which will allow monitoring of\noutcomes  and  a  subsequent  review  and  modification  of  curricula.  Each  trade  will  have  its  own\ntraining  manual  \u2013  leaving  space  for  local  inputs  and  specifics  to  be  introduced  by  implementing\npartner  agencies  and  facilitators  for  specific  courses.  The  teaching  manuals,  where  possible,  will\nintegrate  literacy,  occupational,  and  life  skills.  PMED  will  approve  the  final  curricula  before  mass\nreplication  and  nationwide  dissemination  and  has  therefore  to  retain  and  improve  the  quality  of\nDNFE\u2019s limited technical manpower. The task force will also, where possible, use the Internet for\ndisseminating  course  information  and  materials.  This  will  allow  the  making  of  printouts  at  district\nand Upazila levels by district coordinators (DCOs), monitoring associates (MAs) and Upazila-based\nprogram  coordinators  (PCs).  In  addition  to  being  responsible  for  curriculum  development,  the\nmembers of the task force will serve as core trainers who will train at least two master trainers of\neach INGO. Applying a cascade approach, altogether 840 master trainers will then be able to train\n16,800 facilitators (Appendix 4). All activities of the task force will imply compiling and using past\n\n\f17\n\nand  current  experience  in  NFE  to  develop  improved  curricula  and  train  trainers  for  the  whole\nsubsector.\n\n3.\n\nCapacity Building for Involved Organizations (Component 3)\n\nCapacity  building  encompasses  both  human  resource  development  for  individuals  and\n58.\ninstitutional  or  organizational  development.  Both  kinds  of  development  are  mutually  dependent,\nconstitute  an  ongoing  process,  and  are  instrumental  in  achieving  the  purpose  and  goal  of  the\nProject.  The  Project  supports  strengthening  the  institutional  capacities  of  the  Government,  the\nprivate  sector  including  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  which  aim  to  increase  social\ncohesion  and  inclusion,  particularly  regarding  women  and  other  excluded  groups.  Organizational\ncapacity building demands that the PLCE services promoted for poverty reduction not be isolated\ninterventions. INGOs and their respective services should enhance the capacities of people to take\naction  on  their  own.  Efforts  at  strengthening  the  capacities  of  rural  people  are  by  definition\ncommunity  based.  The  support  of  CMCs,  which  are  instrumental  in  building  capacity  at  the\ncommunity level, is therefore paramount. The ultimate goal is for beneficiaries to take responsibility\nfor  their  choices.  In  addition,  participation  has  an  educational  dimension,  and  it  is  vital  that  it  be\nconsidered  as  a  form  of  collective  learning.  Building  capacity  among  the  poor  requires  their  full\ninvolvement in the PLCE program.\n\n59.\nDNFE  has  the  national  mandate  for  coordinating  Government-funded  NFE  and  ensuring\npolitical, financial, and administrative compliance with set Government standards. By implementing\nthe Project, the Government will be supported to achieve its aim of \u201cdecentralization for program\nplanning,  strategy  formulation  and  resource  formulation  and  encouraging  local  level  participation\nwith ownership in planning and implementation\u201d as stated in the current five-year plan. The Project\nwill support DNFE in assuming a role in the direction of more policy planning, information analysis,\ncontract management, standard setting, and system evaluation. It will help DNFE to improve target\nmonitoring and to develop a stronger concern for program quality. The Project supports setting up\nquality standards, which reflect diversity, creativity, and responsiveness to varying circumstances\nand the importance of complementarity and collaboration among actors involved in implementing\nPLCE.    Approving  quality  standards  of  the  core  curricula  for  continuing  education  and  teacher\ntraining, and assessing curriculum implementation need to remain the responsibility of DNFE at the\nnational level. The Project will therefore support further development of specialized expertise within\nDNFE  through  training.  All  Government  ministries  have  a  provision  for  a  women-in-development\n(WID) focal point \u2014 an officer with the rank of joint secretary/joint chief. The current joint secretary\nof PMED is designated as the WID focal point assisted by an associate WID focal point with the\nrank of senior assistant chief. DNFE has a sub-WID focal point with the rank of deputy director. A\nspecialized  international  consultant  will  work  closely  with  these  officers  to  strengthen  DNFE\u2019s\ncapacity in addressing poverty and equity issues in the Project and the subsector.\n\n60.\nAs  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  contribution  to  a  long-term  vision  for  continuing  education,  the\nProject  will  establish  the  physical  infrastructure  of  a  nonformal  education  resource  center  (NFE-\nRC) at DNFE. It will become the national media, resource, and documentation center for NFE, a\nfocal  point  for  international  exchange  and  national  awareness  building.  The  envisaged  media\nsection  of  the  NFE-RC  is  planned  to  (i)  provide  technical  backup  for  conferences  and\npresentations,  including  technology  to  enhance  meetings  and  distance  learning,  and  (ii)  develop\nweb page infrastructure and expertise to allow publicity for NFE. The resource and documentation\nsection  is  planned  to  (i)  seek  out  information  needs  and  track  publications  useful  to  NFE\nprofessionals;  and  (ii)  collect,  catalogue,  display,  and  make  available  NFE  materials  including\npublications  of  DNFE  and  associated  projects.  As  part  of  the  preparation  for  the  NFE-RC  and  in\nsupport of the consolidation of DNFE headquarters operations, the Project will support the vertical\nextension  of  the  existing  DNFE  building  cum  training/hostel  annex  at  Tejgaon/Dhaka,  which  will\nalso accommodate the NFE-RC. DNFE will ensure that the NFE-RC will be adequately equipped\nand its staff trained with the use of Government or other development partners\u2019 resources.\n\n\f18\n\nContracted  NGOs  and  private  sector  firms  (partner  agencies)  and  temporarily  hired  staff\n61.\nsupporting decentralized implementation of programs will require support to fulfil their mandate in a\nhigh-quality  PLCE  system.  This  will  involve  training  and  guiding  program  supervisors,  program\ncoordinators,  administrators,  accountants,  researchers,  monitoring  specialists,  both  INGO  and\nmonitoring partner agency (MOPA) staff, and resource persons. Except for the training of program\ncoordinators and program facilitators, much of the training of other staff and resource persons will\nbe on-the-job training to be conducted by national and international consultants, international and\nnational  research  institutions,  and  contracted  trainers  and  senior  NFE  professionals  who  used  to\nwork  as  individual  core  trainers  in  Government  NFE  programs.  Capacity  building  for  NGOs  and\nother  partner  agencies  will  be  based  on  supplementary  studies  about  respective  needs\ncommissioned  by  DFID  and  finalized  before  the  Project  starts.  Strengthening  civil  society  and\nprivate  sector  participation  in  coordinating  bodies  like  the  project  coordination  committee,  the\nannual planning workshop, the district NFE committee, the Upazila NFE committee, and the CMC\nis an important capacity-building contribution of the Project in the context of PPP.  The agendas of\nthese committees and their meetings will be expanded and will include knowledge and technology\ntransfer  related  to  NFE,  quality  monitoring,  commenting  on  NGO  action  plans,  and  long-term\nplanning of PLCE, in addition to administrative matters.\n\n4.\n\nImplementing PLCE Programs (Component 4)\n\nUnder this component an estimated 1.6 million learners will complete PLCE courses offered\n62.\nby  210  selected  INGOs  who  are  accountable  to  communities  and  learners  by  obligation  and\nchoice.  The  contract  packages  of  INGOs  will  include  the  purchase  of  skills  training  kits  for  all\nlearners, motorcycles for project staff, and teaching aids for facilitators.   Up to 29 MOPAs will be\nselected to monitor implementation quality in each of the 29 districts. The plan is to provide training\nfor  at  least  nine  months  of  each  year,  divided  into  one  third  of  post-literacy  and  two  thirds  of\ncontinuing  education  on  the  average.  The  remaining  three  months  will  cover  harvest  periods,\nperiods of adverse weather conditions, and time for family issues of the learners. The three months\nwill  also  be  used  for  performance  assessment,  teacher  training,  and  updated  surveys  of  income-\ngenerating opportunities surveys and INGOs\u2019 preparation of action plans for the following year. In\nthe nine months of training, courses will be of varying length to suit learners\u2019 needs and choices. It\nis envisaged that more than one course will be provided in a nine-month period at the same center.\n\n63.\nINGOs in cooperation with CMCs to be physically established and equipped by the Project\nwill  compile  an  inventory  of  available  training  sites  in  each  community.  It  is  assumed  that  each\ncommunity  has  sufficient  training  venues  acceptable  to  the  participating  villagers.  Acceptability\nwould mean appropriate facilities and safety for women. From one to several continuing education\ncenters  (CECs)  will  be  required  in  each  community.  INGOs  will  develop  a  rental  plan  for  these\nfacilities. Implementation of PLCE programs will be supported by substantial external expertise in\nthe field of PLCE, monitoring, and social development. The Project will support DNFE in contract\nmanagement, supervision, and quality assurance of programs.\n\n64.\nAs  part  of  a  program  preparatory  work,  INGO  staff  will  conduct  an  income-generating-\nopportunities survey, which will inform learners about demands for products and services that are\nunmet.  The  survey  will  be  part  of  annual  awareness  building  and  social  mobilization  activities  by\nINGO  program  supervisors  in  each  of  the  210  Upazilas  involving  existing  CMCs  of  the\ncommunities. PLCE courses will usually be two hours a day and up to six days a week, integrating\npost-literacy and skills training. There will be separate courses for males and for female learners.\nLocally hired resource persons, guided and advised by facilitators of INGOs, will be responsible for\nthe  trade-related  skills  training.  Standardized  course  achievement  tests,  developed  by  the  task\nforce, will help to monitor learning achievement and provide feedback to curriculum developers for\nimproving curricula and materials. Continuous qualitative program monitoring by MOPAs will give\n\n\ffeed-back  for  program  development  and  refresher  training  for  facilitators.  Quantitative  monitoring\nby PCs and MAs will provide inputs for the MIS of DNFE.\n\n19\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and\n65.\nduties,  is  estimated  at  $99.7  million  equivalent.  Of  this  amount,  $11.3  million  equivalent,  or  11\npercent of the total cost, is the foreign exchange cost, and $88.4 million equivalent, or 89 percent\nof  the  total  cost,  is  the  local  currency  cost.

It is proposed that ADB provide\n66.\na  loan  of  $65  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  65.2  percent  of  the\nproject costs.  This covers $8.5 million of the foreign exchange cost and $56.5 million equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. ADB financing will be used to finance a portion of the costs relating to civil\nworks,  procurement  of  vehicles,  office  equipment,  consulting  services,  training,  research,  and\nbenefit M&E, but will exclude salaries of regular project staff, rental of office space, and taxes and\nduties. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an\ninterest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.  DFID  will  provide  a  grant  of  $12.0  million  (12  percent  of  total  costs)  to  cofinance  the\nProject with ADB. The Government will provide $20.0 million equivalent (20 percent of total costs).\nThe  beneficiaries, \nin-kind\ncontributions for the operation and maintenance of the training venues.\n\nincluding  communities,  will  provide  $2.7  million  equivalent \n\nin \n\n\f20\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n8.5\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n56.5\n\nDepartment for International Development (DFID)a\n\n2.8\n\nGovernment\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nTotal\na Figures of DFID are tentative, subject to final confirmation by DFID.\n\n11.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n65.0\n\n12.0\n\n20.0\n\n2.7\n\n99.7\n\nPercent\n\n65\n\n12\n\n20\n\n3\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9.2\n\n20.0\n\n2.7\n\n88.4\n\n67.\nThe items to be financed under the Project have, by their nature, a high local cost content.\nThe  provision  of  local  cost  financing  by  ADB  is  considered  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency\nfinancing  policy.20  The  scope  for  expansion  of  domestic  revenues  is  very  limited  due  to  the\ncountry\u2019s  weak  industrial  and  commercial  base  and  the  pressure  of  an  increasing  number  of\nlearners, which outpaces nominal increases of public expenditure on education. The Government\nhas for some years demonstrated its commitment to education by increasing financial allocations\nto education at a higher rate than population increase (1.6 percent) though they have not increased\nsufficiently  relative  to  the  rise  in  number  of  learners.  Due  to  the  low  level  of  per  capita  income,\nwhich constrains national savings and public finances, external assistance is required to meet the\nbulk of the local currency cost of development projects.\n\nE.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n68.\nDNFE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  integrate  the  project  activities  to  the\nextent possible within its regular administrative setup. The EA will be accountable for adherence of\nthe project implementation to Government and ADB procedures and guidelines, as well as overall\ntransparency and accountability principles of the loan utilization.  DNFE\u2019s DCOs who report directly\nto the director general of DNFE and the deputy commissioner and command well-equipped district\nheadquarters,  including  modern  information  and  computer  technology,  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in\nsupervising  the  program,  ensuring  efficient  financial  management  and  contract  compliance  of\npartner agencies, and compiling and analyzing monitoring reports. They will be supported by MAs\nand  PCs.  Upazila  NFE  committees,  headed  by  the  Upazila  Nirbahi  officer  and  district  NFE\ncommittees  chaired  by  the  deputy  commissioner  will  have  important  functions  in  guiding  the\nimplementation  of  PLCE  programs  and  for  strengthening  PPP  in  the  context  of  the  Project\n(Appendix 6).\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nManagement Structure\n\n69.\nA  central  project  implementation  management  unit  (PIMU),  headed  by  a  project  director,\nwill be established within DNFE to coordinate project support from different departments of DNFE\nand field staff at the district level. The PIMU will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation\nof the Project, and the monitoring of general progress in implementing it. Three deputy directors \u2013\n\n                                                \n20 R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Project, 3 January 1995.\n\n\f21\n\none  for  finance  and  two  for  implementation  and  Monitoring  \u2013  and  five  assistant  directors  will\nsupport the project director. The PIMU will work under the overall guidance of the director general\nof DNFE, who will be responsible for the Project. A project coordinating committee (PCC), headed\nby  the  secretary  of  PMED,  will  oversee  the  Project,  approve  operational  plans,  and  ensure\neffective  coordination  of  project  activities  with  those  in  other  projects  and  in  PMED.  Additional\nmembers  will  represent  the  Planning  Commission,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (Finance  Division  and\nEconomic Relations Division), the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA), the Ministry\nof Social Welfare, the Ministry of Youth, the Local Government Division, the NGO Affairs Bureau,\nand two representatives of NFE NGOs.\n\n70.\nThe volume of NGO contracting activity suggests that a great number of tenders will need\nto be processed throughout the Project\u2019s life. An international firm of consultants will be engaged to\nconstitute  the  project  administration  service  (PAS),  which  will  assist  the  PIMU  in  day-to-day\noperations  of  contract  and  financial  administration  and  provide  advice  and  on-the-job  training  in\naccounting  for  INGOs  and  MOPAs.  The  PAS  will  be  an  international  accounting  and  project\nservices firm under contract by the Project. It will provide the services of an international consultant\n(72  person-months,  subject  to  confirmation  during  midterm  review)  with  expertise  in  public\nprocurement and financial management, and two domestic consultants (72 and 36 person-months,\nrespectively).  Under  the  supervision  of  the  project  director,  the  PAS  will  assist  and  facilitate\nprocurement and contracts with partner agencies, and contracts for other services, ensuring that all\nADB  and  Government  procedures  are  followed.  It  will  establish  a  computerized  financial\nmanagement system compatible with the one developed by the PLCEHDP-1. Both systems should\nbe transferable to regular DNFE financial management services at the end of the Project. The PAS\nwill  cooperate  closely  with  the  procurement  consultant  of  PLCEHDP-1.  It  will  train  DNFE\u2019s\nprocurement  core  team  established  under  PLCEHDP-1  to  enable  it  to  take  over  most  of  its\nprocurement-related work toward the end of the Project.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over six years beginning in 2002 and ending in 2008. The\n71.\nProject  will  start  with  a  preparatory  phase  in  the  first  year  preparing  the  ground  for  a  gradual\napproach  of  increasing  the  number  of  learners  every  year,  starting  from  21,600  in  year  1  to\n353,760 in year 6 (Appendix 7).\n\n72.\nThe preparatory phase will last for 12 months. During this phase, international consultants\nwill  help  to  prepare  curricula  and  materials,  plan  training  of  trainers,  and  establish  project\nimplementation structures and mechanisms. In addition, 12 INGOs will be selected in three districts\n\u2013  one  in  the  coastal  area,  one  in  the  center,  and  one  in  the  north  \u2013  of  the  country,  using  criteria\nagreed  upon  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  DFID.  In  the  second  year  of  project  implementation,\nPLCE  courses  will  serve  an  estimated  21,600  learners.  During  the  second  year,  delivery\nmechanisms  and  learning  concepts  will  be  tested  and  adjusted,  and  staff  of  INGOs  and  MOPAs\nwill be trained.  Capable lead agencies, heading a consortium of smaller NGOs and private service\nproviders, will provide guidance and ensure knowledge transfer aimed to increase the capacity of\ntheir  smaller  partners,  which  could  become  lead  agencies  in  the  following  years  of  project\nimplementation.  Cost-sharing  options  with  communities  and  learners  and  ways  of  targeting  the\npotentially most productive learners are topics for field studies at this stage of implementation.\n\n73.\nIn  year  3,  the  number  of  Upazilas  covered  and  learners  enrolled  in  PLCE  courses  will\ngradually increase (to 64 Upazilas and 115,200 learners). The number of learners will increase to\n426,480  in  year  4;  525,120  in  year  5;  and  572,640  in  year  6.  Similarly,  the  number  of  CECs  will\nreach maximum in years 5 and 6, with 8,400 centers. Each year or training cycle will be preceded\nby  a  three-month  development  period  for  the  NGOs  involved,  including  extensive  staff  training.\nDuring the preparation period, the Project will ensure that support functions are in place and that\nCECs  are  rented  and  equipped.  Evaluations  and  lessons  learned  at  the  end  of  each  cycle  will\n\n\f22\n\nserve  to  improve  and  refine  curricula,  teacher  training,  and  the  model  of  cooperation  between\npublic and private actors involved. Thus the experience gained in each cycle of training can help to\nimprove the design of succeeding cycles.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n74.\nAll ADB-financed procurement for the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nThe  PIMU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  the  PCC.\nIndicative procurement packages are in Appendix 8.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\n75.\nThe expansion of the existing DNFE building, which was established by the ADB/IDA/SDC-\nsupported  NFEP-1  will  be  the  only  construction  activity.  To  support  the  consolidation  of  DNFE\nheadquarters  operations  and  to  establish  the  NFE-RC,  the  Project  will  support  the  vertical\nextension  of  the  existing  DNFE  office  building  cum  training/hostel  annex  in  Tejgaon,  Dhaka.\nExisting engineering drawings will be used and a construction engineer to be recruited under the\nProject will supervise construction. This contract for extending the DNFE headquarters costs less\nthan $1.0 million and is unlikely to attract the interest of international contractors. The contract will\nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\nGovernment will submit detailed plans and budgets to be approved by ADB before withdrawal for\nany expenditure for this project activity is made.\n\nb.\n\nEquipment and Materials\n\nIt  is  anticipated  that  there  will  not  be  any  packages  for  equipment  costing  over  $500,000.\n76.\nPackages  for  equipment  costing  $100,000  to  $500,000  will  be  procured  following  international\nshopping procedures, and those costing less than $100,000 through LCB. The PAS will assist the\nPIMU  to  procure  office  equipment  and  vehicles  under  international  shopping  or  LCB.  Office\nfurniture and motorcycles will be purchased following the LCB procedures acceptable to ADB. To\nachieve economy and efficiency, goods of similar nature will be grouped into packages under one\nor  more  tenders.  Contracts  will  be  awarded  on  a  package  basis,  or  on  the  basis  of  a  least-cost\ncombination of packages (Appendix 8).\n\nc.\n\nServices of NGOs and Other Partner Agencies\n\n77.\nThe  services  of  INGOs  and  MOPAs  will  be  contracted  following  the  existing  subvention\nsystem  of  DNFE,  which  will  be  modified  as  follows.  Interested  parties  will  be  invited  for\nprequalification.  Based  on  formal  selection  criteria  (Appendix  3)  and  the  candidates\u2019  capabilities,\nresources, and geographic presence in specified areas, a NGO or firm will be selected and asked\nto  elaborate  an  action  plan,  which  refers  to  the  package  of  required  services  as  specified  in  the\nterms  of  reference.  Actions  plans  are  technical  proposals  to  be  compiled  according  to  guidelines\nestablished by the PIMU. They will be assessed with reference to established criteria acceptable to\nADB and DFID. PIMU consultants may help to improve the action plans, that meet basic criteria.\nContracts will include provisions for recurrent costs in the partner agencies.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n78.\nAll consultants financed by ADB and DFID will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengaging domestic consultants. Altogether, 10 international and 18 domestic consultants will assist\nin implementing, managing, and monitoring project activities. A total input of 171 person-months of\ninternational  and  476  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  is  planned.  The  number  of\nperson-months  needed  will  be  reevaluated  during  the  mid-term  review  of  the  Project.  The\n\n\fconsulting  services  will  be  provided  through  international  consulting  firms  in  collaboration  with\ndomestic consultant firms and will be selected according to ADB\u2019s guidelines (Appendix 9). Three\ncontract packages of consulting services are foreseen.\n\n23\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n79.\nWith the prior approval of ADB, advance action will be taken to expedite the implementation of\nthe  Project.  To  allow  timely  engagement  of  the  consultants  required  for  the  PAS,  a  shortlist  of\ninternational consulting firms and the terms of reference of other consulting services under the PIMU will\nbe agreed upon by the Government, ADB, and DFID before loan effectiveness. The Government has\nbeen advised that approval for advance action does not commit ADB to approve the Project.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursements and Imprest Account\n\n80.\nTo  facilitate  project  implementation  and  ensure  timely  release  of  the  loan  proceeds,  the\nGovernment  will  establish  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness  an  imprest  account  in  dollars  at  a\ncommercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB.21 Statement of expenditure procedures\nwill  be  applied  for  reimbursement  and  liquidation/replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  to  cover\npayments  of  contracts  for  $5,000  or  less.  After  the  initial  deposit,  the  imprest  account  will  be\nsimultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis. The amount to be deposited will be\nbased on anticipated expenditures to be incurred for 3-6 months, not exceeding 10 percent of the\nloan amount. The imprest funds will be maintained in US dollars for conversion to local cash only\nat the time of payment. Applications of different disbursement modes and procedures by amount of\npayment  and  currency  involved,  including  the  establishment,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the\nimprest account will be carried out according to the latest ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n\n7.\n\nAccounts and Auditing\n\n81.\nDNFE,  assisted  by  the  PAS,  will  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to\nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan proceeds. All  project  accounts  and  related\nfinancial statements will be maintained by the PIMU, assisted by the PAS, and will be audited each\nyear in accordance with sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The\naudited accounts and financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within\n12  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  PAS  will  assist  DNFE  in  maintaining  proper\nProject accounts acceptable to ADB. The annual audit will include the audit of all involved partner\nagencies of the Project on a yearly sample basis, which will guarantee that all partner agencies will\nbe audited at least once during the project duration. The annual audit will include the audit of the\nimprest account and statement of expenditures and a separate audit opinion on their use should be\nincluded in the annual audit report.\n\n8.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n82.\nThe Government was informed of the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on\nfraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.\n\n9.\n\nReporting\n\n83.\nThe PIMU will prepare and submit to ADB progress reports within 10 days after the end of\neach  semester  of  the  fiscal  year,  with  a  copy  to  DFID,  in  a  format  agreed  upon  during  the  loan\n\n                                                \n21 The paragraph was prepared based on the latest ADB guidelines available in March 2001. Provisions are subject to\nchange  and  those  included  in  the  latest  guidelines  at  the  time  of  actions  taken  will  always  prevail  during\nimplementation.\n\n\f24\n\ninception  mission.  The  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against\nestablished  targets;  (ii)  problems  encountered  during  the  period  and  remedial  actions  taken  or\nproposed to resolve the problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed project\nactivities  to  be  undertaken  and  physical  and  financial  progress  expected  during  the  succeeding\nsemester,  including  detailed  contract  awards  and  disbursement  projections.  At  the  end  of  the\nProject,  DNFE  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  and  submit  it  to  ADB  and  DFID  not  later\nthan  three  months  after  physical  completion  of  the  Project.  The  report  will  include  the  costs  and\ncompliance with loan covenants.\n\n10.\n\nProject Performance\n\na.\n\nAnnual Operational Plans and Financial Reviews\n\nTo  facilitate  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  prepare  two  months  before  the\n84.\nstart of each fiscal year (in May of each year) an annual operation plan for the coming year. The\nplan  will  include  (i)  fully  costed  proposed  project  activities  for  each  output,  with  performance\ntargets; and (ii) details of how proposed project activities are to be integrated into DNFE\u2019s ongoing\nactivities  and  projects,  particularly  the  PLCEHDP-1.  This  will  ensure  a  coherent  approach  to  the\ndevelopment  of  PLCE  and  will  help  avoid  any  duplication  of  efforts.  In  addition,  the  annual\noperation  plan  will  confirm  that  the  Government  has  allocated  adequate  resources  in  its  project\nimplementation and recurrent budget for the Project.\n\nb.\n\nReviews of the Project\n\n85.\nThe Government, ADB, and DFID will review the Project at the end of each year, starting\nwith a comprehensive review of the project design at the end of year 2. The review will concentrate\non compliance with specific loan covenants and whether all required inputs and support functions\non  the  Government  side  are  in  place.  The  review  will  also  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of\nimplementation  mechanisms  and  the  efficiency  of  the  training  approach,  and  may  result  in  a\ndecision to continue them or to change them. The Government, ADB, and DFID will document their\nagreement on these issues in the review report. They will undertake a midterm review (MTR) of the\nProject at the end of year 3 of project implementation. The review will assess the summary report\nand recommendations regarding the national framework policy and the progress and achievements\nof  the  Project  against  its  objectives  after  due  consideration  of  the  results  of  the  previous  review.\nThe review will include an assessment of the long-term vision for NFE in Bangladesh, as presented\nin  the  Government\u2019s  action  plan.  In  consultation  with  the  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission  (BRM)  of\nADB  and  with  DFID,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  MTR  report  including  a  midterm  monitoring\nreport for submission to ADB and DFID at least 14 days before the fielding of the MTR mission.\n\n86.\nJoint Government-ADB-DFID reviews at the end of years 4 and 5 will (i) analyze the results\nof  the  previous  year/training  cycle,  (ii)  identify  changes  needed,  (iii)  assess  the  impact  of  the\nProject  on  poverty  reduction,  (iv)  assess  project  contributions  to  the  national  framework  for\ncontinuing  education,  (v)  assess  implementation  performance  against  agreed-upon  indicators  in\nthe project framework, (vi) identify continuing education policy issues, and (vii) identify constraints\nto  project  implementation.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  (i)  the  effectiveness  of  project\nstrategies for promoting greater participation of females and disadvantaged groups; (ii) progress on\nkey  project innovations,  including  progress of developing PPP, and assessing learning outcomes\nand quality of teaching; and (iii) coordination between the Project and PLCEHDP-1. At the end of\nyear 6, a final review will be conducted with focus on lessons learned for future projects.\n\nc.\n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A Handbook,  the Project has\n87.\nselected a list of verifiable indicators for M&E. Benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) comprises\n\n\f25\n\nactivities  conducted  periodically  by  MOPAs  to  gather  information  through  multiple  sources,\nincluding tracer and impact studies, to determine whether the inputs delivered for implementing the\nprogram  activities  have  yielded  the  expected  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries.  BME  also\nseeks  to  detect  any  deficiency  in  and  discrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  a\nprogram  in  using  the  resources  efficiently,  so  that  timely  corrections  can  be  made  to  update  the\nprogram  to  improve  benefits,  outcomes,  and  impact.  BME  will  utilize  information  from  progress\nreports,  annual  reviews,  the  midterm  review,  and  periodic  evaluations  and  studies.  Impact\nmonitoring  will  provide  valuable  qualitative  data  to  support  program  improvement  during  the\nlifetime of the Project.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n88.\nNo significant adverse impacts on the environment were identified. In the longer term, the\nProject should aid the environment in that the course curricula will cover environmental impact and\nsustainability.  Teachers  will  receive  basic  environment  awareness  training  as  part  of  their\ncertification.  Monitoring  training  at  the  Upazila  level  will  include  monitoring  any  adverse\nenvironmental  impacts.  Skills  training  will  emphasize  the  efficient  use  of  resources  and  the\nrecycling  of  existing  resources.  Agricultural  training  will  continue  to  emphasize  the  safe  and\nappropriate  use  of  chemicals.  By  locally  providing  skills  for  the  unemployed,  the  Project  will\ndiscourage migration to the cities and thus indirectly lessen urban environmental pollution.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na.\n\nGender Issues and Approach\n\nin \n\n89.\nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  put  considerable  efforts  into  education,  including\neducation  for  girls  and  women.  Despite  improvements,  gender-specific  gaps  are  still  wide,\nespecially in rural areas. Women generally have fewer opportunities than men, and women of all\nclasses  usually  hold  subordinate  positions  in  society  compared  with  men.  They  have  fewer\nsocioeconomic  opportunities \nterms  of  education,  health,  economic  participation,  and\nparticipation  in  the  political  and  decision-making  process.    Preference  for  male  children  is  an\nobvious cultural trait in Bangladesh and parents typically think that any investment made in a boy\u2019s\neducation yields a higher return since the boy is expected to look after his parents when they are\nold.  The  prevalence  of  the  social  custom  of  expensive  dowry  even  in  Muslim  families  motivates\nparents  to  save  money  for  their  daughter\u2019s  marriage  rather  than  invest  it  in  their  daughters\u2019\neducation. Low levels of literacy and education among the parents further reinforce those attitudes.\nWhile the gender gap is closing in Bangladesh for most of the social indicators such as mortality\nand  life  expectancy,  the  overall  level  of  empowerment  measured  in  terms  of  literacy,  workforce\nparticipation,  property  rights,  and  credit  access  leaves  much  to  be  desired.22  Women  in\nBangladesh  continue  to  have  very  little  access  to  or  control  of  productive  resources  such  as\neducation, information, land, and financial resources.\n\n90.\nDespite these obstacles, women\u2019s involvement in basic literacy programs appears to have\ngenerally positive results.  Evidence from different projects (see footnote 7) indicates that women\nare less likely to drop out from the course and are more consistent and more committed attendees\nthan men are. Increased mobility within the community and the social interaction that occurs during\nthe  basic  literacy  courses  certainly  represent  a  benefit  for  women.  Evidence23  also  suggests  that\nwomen (and their families) have benefited greatly from the social and life skills elements of training\ncourses  as  reflected  in  improvements  in  health,  hygiene,  and  school  attendance  and  better\n\n                                                \n22 Bangladesh Human Development Report, 2000, BIDS, January 2001.\n23 Hossain, A. 2001. Gender and Parity in PLCE Primer.  Dhaka.\n\n\f26\n\nunderstanding of law and advocacy issues.  Selecting useful and appropriate course topics, which\nrespond to market demands, and take place at appropriate localities at a convenient time, become\nkey issues for poor female and male participants.\n\n91. Women increasingly head households as the social fabric disintegrates and men migrate to\ncities  and  desert  or  divorce  their  wives,  without  providing  support  for  the  children.  Unsupported\nwomen who are also household heads constitute some of the most vulnerable of the poor. Rural\nwomen have difficulty in getting access to justice and are often unaware of their constitutional and\nlegal  rights.  By  enhancing  their  literacy  and  giving  them  income-related  skills,  the  Project  will\nsignificantly enhance the position of women, in terms of not only their improved economic position\nbut  also  their  enhanced  status,  confidence,  and  social  skills.  Field  visits  and  background  studies\nindicate that one of the side benefits of continuing education and literacy courses for women is that\nthey are able to mix socially with their peers and to share information and support.\n\n92.\nThere  appear  to  be  two  potential  groups  of  beneficiaries  among  women.  In  many  rural\ncommunities,  very  few  women  have  attended  primary  school.  In  the  15-25  age  group,  there  are\nmany intelligent women who, in the absence of literacy and continuing education programs, would\nnot  realize  their  economic  and  social  potential.  A  second,  older  group  of  women  may  have  large\nfamilies and heavy domestic duties; literacy and skills training for them are likely to be different, but\nstill  important.  The  Project  will  address  these  differences  through  training,  support,  and  course\nstructure. By employing female MAs who will undertake participatory monitoring of the Project, the\nProject will also ensure that the voice of women is clearly heard. The baseline study undertaken in\nthe preparatory phase will identify indicators for gender equity to ensure parity of experience and\nachievement for women (Appendix 10).\n\nConsidering  the  existing  obstacles  to  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project,  and  in\n93.\nrecognition  of  the  impact  of  NFE  on  women  and  thus  on  the  whole  family,  an  indicative  gender\nstrategy and plan was prepared. The social development consultant together with DNFE and key\nstakeholders and partners will refine the strategy in the preparatory phase. The strategy will define\npractical, operational measures for ensuring that poor women, men, and adolescents benefit from\nthe  Project.  The  Project  seeks  to  infuse  the  institutional  setup  with  a  gender  balance  to  ensure\nparticipation of women at all levels. Special attention will be paid to ensuring a high proportion of\nwomen at supervisory, master trainer, and teaching and learning levels.\n\nb.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n94.\nEducation,  including  NFE,  is  considered  a  prime  factor  for  poverty  reduction.  The\nGovernment is committed to attain total literacy by the year 2006. To achieve this objective, literacy\nprograms  for  17  million  participants  have  been  implemented,  resulting  in  64  percent  increase  in\naverage adult literacy rate for the population aged 15 in 2001, compared with 35 percent in 1991.\nThe Project will be implemented in rural areas where literacy rates still lag behind urban levels and\nfemale literacy rates (estimated to be around 57 percent) still lag behind rates for males (around 67\npercent).24\n\n95.\nQualitative studies of the impact of previous projects have shown considerable increase in\nthe social and physical capital of poor learners. Better health and nutrition, increased enrollment of\nprimary school children, better hygiene and sanitation, and an increased knowledge of legal rights,\nnational history and culture as well as environmental awareness have been reported as a results of\nsocial  awareness  and  life  skills  training.  The  Project  aims  to  reinforce  these  effect  of  previous\nprojects and to ensure their long-term sustainability. Increased assets such as land, better housing\n\n                                                \n24  A  note  of  caution  is  required.  Anyone  who  completes  a  literacy  program  is  classified  in  official  data  as  literate.\n\nHowever, there is considerable doubt as to the standard of literacy being achieved and retained.\n\n\f27\n\nand  sanitation,  and  homestead  farms  are  likely  outcomes  of  increased  skills  that  lead  to\nemployment, self-employment, and a general improvement of living conditions.\n\n96.\nVarious factors affecting access to PLCE courses for poorer neo-literate men and women\nwill  be  highlighted  by  studies  that  the  Project  will  conduct  in  the  first  12  selected  Upazilas.  The\nstudies will seek to build a profile of these diverse neo-literates and of the constraints they face in\naccessing  and  utilizing  continuing  education  skills.  The  needs  of  adolescents  are  different  from\nthose of young women; married women\u2019s needs differ from those in households headed by single\nmothers. The design  of courses will also need to respond to the needs of poor men and women\nwith  occupations  such  as  agricultural  daily  wage  laborers,  servants,  and  petty  traders.  Findings\nfrom  these  studies  will  constitute  important  information  for  INGOs  and  resource  persons  in\ndesigning  the  curriculum  and  selecting  skills  and  trades.  To  ensure  access  for  the  rural  poor,\npoverty-related  issues  like  the  pressure  to  work,  tiredness,  different  needs  of  different  groups,  or\nthe inadequacy of learning venues will be addressed by the micro design of programs. Location of\ntraining courses, course timing and duration, course materials, and teachers\u2019 support will need to\nbe adjusted accordingly.\n\nc.\n\nDirect Beneficiaries\n\n97.\nThe  Project\u2019s  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  1.6  million  neo-literates  in  rural  areas  who,\nbecause of entrenched poverty in their families, did not attend primary school, or who dropped out\nof  school  as  children  to  work  as  laborers,  but  who  subsequently  attended  basic  literacy  courses.\nThe  Project  will  provide  information  about  income-generating  opportunities  to  help  them  choose\ntraining from a selected range of traditional and non-traditional opportunities. The Project will build\non  and  reinforce  their  newly  acquired  literacy  and  equip  them  with  specific  income-related  skills,\nenabling  them  to  enhance  their  family\u2019s  incomes.  Thus  the  Project  will  provide  them  with  an\nopportunity to escape the cycle of poverty.\n\n98.\nBeneficiaries will acquire new, practical skills that will improve family incomes. Pilot projects\nhave  shown  that  the  life  and  social  skills  components  significantly  improved  awareness  of  social\nissues, health and hygiene in the family, and support for school attendance of children. An integral\nelement of poverty is ignorance. Reports on poverty reduction and evidence from the field studies\nduring  project  preparation  (TA  3465-BAN,  footnote  1)  clearly  show  that  literacy,  awareness  of\nrights and justice, and access to information help poor people to avoid being cheated, create more\nequitable  access  to  social  facilities,  and  give  marginalized  people,  including  women,  a  voice  in\ncommunity affairs.\n\nThe Project will have a positive impact on the learners themselves, on their communities,\n99.\nand  especially  on  their  families  and  children.  By  sharing  their  experiences  on  issues  of  poverty,\ngender,  child  rearing,  they  will  enlarge  their  options,  improve  their  quality  of  life,  and  build  up\nconfidence.  Better  educated  women  are  likely  to  have  lower  fertility  rates,  smaller  family  sizes,\nbetter  child-rearing  practices,  better  health-related  practices,  and  more  income  opportunities\noutside the home, and will pass on enhanced values and confidence to their children. In addition to\nproviding tangible assets such as more skilled labor and human capital, the proposed Project will also\nstrengthen the stock of intangible assets such as household relations and social capital. At the family\nlevel, effects will be positive on household structures and family relationships. Households have been\nrecognized  as  adaptive  institutions  for  pooling  income  and  other  resources  and  for  sharing  both\nconsumption and income-raising strategies. Behavioral changes of direct beneficiaries will also influence\nother  men  and  especially  women  in  their  localities,  and  thereby  enhance  the  social  fabric  of  the\ncommunity.\n\n\fd.\n\nCommunity and Learners\u2019 Participation\n\n28\n\n100. Community  participation  is  a  key  mechanism  for  the  demand  orientation  and  bottom-up\nplanning approach of the Project. Interviews and focus groups in 24 villages, as well as meetings\nwith elected community representatives, gave selected communities a chance to directly contribute\nto the design of the Project during its preparation. To ensure community participation at all stages\nof  project  implementation,  the  terms  of  reference  of  INGOs  will  include  measurable  indicators\nrelated  to  community  participation  and  gender  equity.  Community  profiling  will  help  ensure  that\ncontinuing  education  courses  are  inclusive  and  respond  to  participants\u2019  needs.  For  sociocultural\nreasons, many women may never leave their community. Most communities have no access to market\ninformation that would assist them in choosing skills to learn, crops to grow, or products or services to\nprovide  that  are  in  demand  locally.    INGOs  will  assist  learners  in  selecting  specific  skills  by\npresenting  the  results  of  income-generating-opportunity  surveys,  which  will  allow  informed\ndecisions by learners. Facilitators and resource persons (skill trainers) who have knowledge of the\nrespective communities or come from these communities will be preferably selected, and at least\n50 percent of them will be female. The Project will enhance the lives of learners directly by enhancing\ntheir newly acquired and as yet fragile literacy, and by imparting income-related skills. The learners also\nwill benefit through increased confidence, greater awareness of and access to the world outside of their\ncommunity, and knowledge of how to improve their health, hygiene and nutrition. Wherever possible,\nskills  trainers  will  be  local  trades  people.  MAs,  PCs,  and  MOPAs  will  encourage  assessment  by\nlearners of the benefit of training as the participants perceive it. Finally, rental payments for the use\nof existing community-owned training venues are envisaged to encourage community involvement\nin the Project. The Project will contribute to the strengthening of civil society, by supporting coordinating\ncommittees at district, Upazila and community levels and including them in the literacy and continuing\neducation decision-making and monitoring process.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Justification\n\nThe Project is justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. Continuing education training\n101.\nin  Bangladesh,  especially  in  the  rural  areas,  either  is  absent  or  is  undersupplied  because  the\nprivate sector cannot provide and finance them. The Project will remedy this economic inefficiency\nby  giving  neo-literate  men  and  women  the  skills  needed  for  employment  or  income  generation\nbased  on  local  opportunities.  The  Project  will  help  improve  agricultural  productivity  by  increasing\nthe skills of farm families and will support self-employment by linking existing microcredit facilities\nwith  skills  training.  In  the  long  term,  employers  will  have  access  to  more  skilled,  literate,  and\nproductive  employees  better  able  to  contribute  to  economic  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  while\nBangladesh  has  achieved  successful  economic  growth  in  recent  years,  such  growth  has  not\nproportionately benefited the poor, as reflected in the steadily widening inequality in the distribution\nof incomes. The Project addresses an area of endemic poverty by focusing on the poor who have\ncompleted courses in basic literacy.\n\n102.\nThe Project aims at enhancing the human and social capital of the direct beneficiaries. It is\nenvisaged  that  at  least  50  percent  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  women,  for  whom  income-earning\nopportunities have been very limited. The Project will promote female participation in economic and\nincome-generating  activities  of  households  in  the  rural  sector.  Research  studies  in  various\ndeveloping countries have demonstrated that with each level of education and training, women are\nmore  likely  to  have  lower  fertility  rates,  smaller  family  sizes,  better  child-rearing  practices,  better\nhealth-related practices, more work outside the home, higher incomes, and, most crucial of all, will\npass on to their children strongly pro-education, pro-training, and pro-literacy values.\n\n\f29\n\nThe  Project  also  contributes  to  an  enabling  institutional  environment  for  NFE.  At  the  sub-\n103.\nsector level, the Project will support the development of a national system of continuing education\nthat  will meet the  needs  of the country and will upgrade its workforce to meet national economic\ngoals. DNFE, which has the national mandate for coordinating and expanding continuing education\nwill be strengthened to develop efficient partnerships with private sector organizations. The Project\nwill  support  the  improvement  of  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  NGOs  through  consultation,\nmaximizing their skills to deliver continuing education and providing staff training. An inclusive and\nresponsive community-based skills training model will be developed and made operational.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n104.\nThe Project represents an innovative attempt to address one of the main causes of poverty,\nespecially among women, by focusing on the achievement of functional literacy and the acquisition\nof practical, employable skills. Without the Project, the potential beneficiaries will continue to work\non an unskilled, inefficient, and low productivity basis. The project impact will put them on the path\ntoward higher incomes through involvement in microenterprises, self-employment, and other work.\nThe enhanced literacy and income-related skills will be a significant factor in breaking the cycle of\npoverty in the rural areas of Bangladesh for 1.6 million learners. The economic argument for NFE\nis stronger if existing premises and facilities can be used at little or no cost.\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  under  a  set  of  conservative  assumptions  is\n105.\nestimated  to  be  35.3  percent.  The  sensitivity  of  Project  viability  was  tested  under  some  adverse\nscenarios. Under a low-employment scenario, the IRR is estimated to be 23.0 percent. The Project\nviability  is  robust  to  the  adverse  scenarios.  Furthermore,  a  \u201cswitching  scenario\u201d  was  simulated.  It\nshows  that  it  will  take  an  unlikely  scenario  of  both  reduction  in  incremental  daily  wage  and  a\nreduction in employment rate before the Project becomes non-viable (Appendix 11).\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\n106. While  the  Government  is  expected  to  be  the  primary  source  of  funds  for  the  removal  of\nbarriers to literacy and NFE, it is inappropriate for the Government to continue to fully finance the\ncomprehensive  system.  The  use  of  existing  infrastructure  for  training  will  greatly  reduce  NFE\nsystem costs. Supplementary payments to available teachers in the formal system will encourage\nthem to function, at small cost, as trained teachers for PLCE courses. The use of rental facilities\nwill  reduce  capital  costs.  It  is  envisaged  that  skills  trainers  will  be  local  trades  people  hired  and\ntrained for a few hours of training work each day, at the commercial hourly rate for artisans.\n\n107. Notwithstanding  the  various  considerations  that  will  contribute  to  cost  reduction,  it  is\nmeaningful  to  examine  the  fiscal  affordability  of  the  project  recurrent  costs.  Under  the  simple\nassumption  that  the  economic  growth  rate,  share  of  education  expenditure  share  in  GDP,  and\nshare  of  NFE  budget  allocation  will  not  change  from  the  current  level,  it  is  projected  that  at  the\npeak  of  the  project  recurrent  expenditure  in  2005-2006,  its  share  in  the  NFE  expenditure  will  be\nabout 28 percent, and then decline to 21.5 percent at the end of the implementation period. Since\nthe present DNFE programs consisting of basic literacy and post-literacy courses will largely have\nbeen  concluded,  the  required  level  of  project  recurrent  expenditure  should  be  sustainable  at  this\nlevel  under  this  scenario.  The  fiscal  implication  beyond  the  project  implementation  period  will\ndepend  on  whether  similar  investments  will  be  made  and  in  what  size  in  the  NFE  sector;  that,\nhowever, is outside the scope of the analysis here.\n\n\fB. \n\nRisks\n\n1.\n\nTimely Implementation\n\n30\n\n108.\nImplementation  of  the  Project  is  based  on  continuous  monitoring  and  learning  as  the\nProject  moves  through  its  distinct  implementation  phases  and  gradually  increases  the  number  of\nUpazilas,  CECs,  and  learners.  Each  training  cycle  of  nine  months  will  be  preceded  by  a  three-\nmonth  development  period  for  the  partner  agencies  involved,  including  extensive  staff  training.\nEvaluations  at  the  end  of  each  cycle  will  serve  to  improve  and  refine  delivery  mechanisms  and\nother  design  elements.  Delayed  preparation,  implementation,  or  evaluation  of  one  cycle  would\ntherefore affect timely implementation of subsequent cycles. To assist the physical implementation\nof  the  Project,  particularly  of  civil  works,  procurement  of  equipment  and  services,  and  financial\nadministration,  the  Project  will  recruit  a  team  of  specialized  professionals  who  will  constitute  the\nPAS.  Advance  action  by  ADB  will  enable  the  establishment  of  the  PAS  soon  after  loan\neffectiveness. The Government has also assured that key staff of the PIMU will be appointed within\none month of the effective date.\n\n2.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships\n\n109. Partnerships  are  fundamental  because,  acting  on  their  own,  neither  the  Government  nor\npartner  agencies  and  the  NGO  community  at  large  can  achieve  the  quantitative  targets  and  the\nquality  of  the  needed  programs.  The  promotion  of  PPP,  based  on  shared  objectives,\nresponsibilities, and a common understanding of the process and outputs of continuing education\nprograms,  needs  commitment  from  both  NGOs  and  the  Government.  PMED  has  shown  its\ncommitment  to  extend  cooperation  to  private  sector  organizations  based  on  extended  and  well-\ndefined contractual relationships. This marks an important intermediate step on the longer way to\ndecentralization and broad partnership as envisaged by the Government\u2019s Fifth Five-Year Plan.\n\n3.\n\nOther Risks\n\n110.\nThere  are  risks  associated  with  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  innovative  PLCE  concept  and\ndelivery  approaches  that  the  Project  will  elaborate  and  use.  To  mitigate  the  risks  and  to  provide\nguidance in the first training cycle of the Project, DFID will undertake a number of supplementary\nstudies  focusing  on  (i)  the  effective  design  and  planning  of  the  PLCE  program;  (ii)  guidelines  for\nNGOs to help them draw up annual action plans that can be assessed; and (iii) an assessment of\nthe management capacities of potential partner agencies in the 12 Upazilas.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n111.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\nWithin one month of loan effectiveness, key staff in the PIMU, including three deputy\ndirectors and five assistant directors, will be appointed.\n\n(ii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, DNFE will recruit staff for two additional\n\npositions for M&E activities.\n\n(iii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish the PCC,\nwhich will include representatives of DNFE, PMED, Planning Commission, Ministry\nof  Finance  (Finance  Division  and  Economic  Relations  Division),  Ministry  of  Social\n\n\f31\n\nWelfare,  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Youth,  NGO  Affairs\nBureau, local government division, and NGOs.\n\n(iv)  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  DNFE  will  enter  into  a  contract  with  an\ninternational  accounting  and  project  services  firm  that  will  assist  the  PIMU  in  the\nday-to-day contract and financial administration.\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nProject  implementation  will  take  place  in  a  decentralized  way  with  emphasis  on\nactivities at the community level. DCOs and PCs in the Upazilas will work in close\ncooperation  with  NFE  committees  at  the  district  and  Upazila  levels,  respectively.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  NFE  committees  include  representatives  of\nGovernment  line  agencies,  local  employers  or  Chambers  of  Commerce  as  well  as\nimplementing  and  monitoring  NGOs.  At  the  community  level,  the  Government  will\nensure  that  CMCs  are  representative  of  all  members  of  that  community,  including\nneo-literate  women,  men,  and  adolescents.  To  the  extent  possible,  50  percent  of\nCMC members will be women.\n\nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  budget  allocation  to  DNFE  to  meet  the\ncounterpart  funds  requirement  for  each  fiscal  year  during  project  implementation,\nand  will  provide  ADB  with  information  on  the  actual  allocations  given  to  the\nsubsector within three months of the close of each fiscal year. At the end of year 2\nof project implementation, PMED will present an action plan based on a draft policy\nframework,  which  will  include  (a)  a  long-term  financial  plan  for  PLCE,  showing\nadequate  funding  of  all  recurrent  costs  for  the  subsector  until  the  year  2010;  (b)\nguidelines  for  cost  sharing  in  PLCE,  taking  into  account  community  in-kind\ncontributions;  and  (c)  a  review  of  the  issue  of  including  school  dropouts  in  PLCE\nprograms.\n\n(vii)  DNFE will ensure that the selection of learners, courses, training sites, participating\ncommunities,  and  partner  agencies  is  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by\nDNFE, ADB, and DFID.\n\n(viii)  DNFE will take all appropriate and necessary measures to ensure an overall female\n\nenrollment of at least 50 percent in its continuing education programs.\n\n(ix)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, PMED and DNFE will issue instructions and\nguidelines  encouraging  local  community  involvement  in  planning,  testing,  and\ndecision making regarding PLCE programs.\n\n(x)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  DNFE  will  award  third-party  monitoring\ncontracts  to  consulting  firms  on  terms  and  conditions  agreed  upon  by  the\nthat  all\nGovernment,  ADB,  and  DFID.  The  Government  will  ensure \nrecommendations made by these MOPAs will be reflected in the operational plans\nfor the Project.\n\n(xi)  Within 15 months of loan effectiveness, DNFE will submit to ADB detailed baseline\ndata  for  evaluating  the  impact  of  PLCE  programs.  Data  will  be  segregated  by\ngender.\n\n(xii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that office conditions will allow the unrestricted use of\ncomputers  and  that  a  maintenance  plan  for  DNFE  headquarters  is  in  place  before\nthe commencement of the construction works of the DNFE extension.\n\n\f32\n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  for  construction  works,  the  Government\u2019s\nfor  Selected\nrequirements,  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines \nenvironmental \nInfrastructure  Development  Projects  and  other  relevant  ADB  guidelines  on  the\nenvironment will be followed.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n112.\n\nThe Government will meet the following conditions before the loan becomes effective:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government will have approved the project proforma, which will be consistent\nwith this Report and with the loan agreement.\n\nThe  Government  will  have  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Government  of  the\nUnited  Kingdom  regarding  the  DFID  grant  or  will  have  made  other  arrangements\nacceptable to ADB for the cofinancing of 12 percent of the total Project cost.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe PIMU within DNFE will have been established and the project director will have\nbeen appointed.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n113.\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\nand  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of\nAgreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent\nto Special Drawing Rights 50,858,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Post-Literacy\nand Continuing Education Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and\nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set\nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nMYOUNG-HO SHIN\n     Vice-President\n\n22 November 2001\n\n\fPage\n\nCited on\n(page,

Based  on  the  eligibility  criteria  and  the  candidates\u2019  capabilities,\nresources, and geographic presence in specified areas, DNFE will compile a list of prequalified\nNGOs,  including  a  reserve  list.  NGOs  will  then  be  invited  to  elaborate  an  action  plan,  which\nrefers  to  the  package  of  required  service  as  described  in  the  terms  of  reference.  Action  plans\nare  technical  proposals  to  be  compiled  by  NGOs  according  to  guidelines  established  by  the\nproject implementation management unit (PIMU).\n\n3.\nThe  proposal  submission  period  will  be  not  less  than  28  days  from  the  date  of  pre-\nqualification.  Initially,  INGOs  will  be  contracted  for  one  year  on  probation.  After  having\nsuccessfully met targets and set quality standards, their contracts (scoring table in para. 7 can\nbe  used)  will  be  extended  for  the  remaining  period  of  project  implementation  on  the  basis  of\nyearly action plans to be approved by DNFE. Should INGOs fail in one of the subsequent years,\nthe action plans will not be approved and funding will not be provided. In that case one of the\nprequalified NGOs on the reserve list will be contracted as a replacement.\n\n4.\nInterested  INGOs  and  firms  must  obtain  a  copy  of  the  Project  Report  from  DNFE  and\nsubmit  proposals  in  accordance  with  it.  INGOs  will  submit  separate  proposals  for  each\nsubdistrict, indicating the number of contract packages that it is interested in. However, DNFE\nwill determine the number of contract packages to be awarded to a particular INGO, using the\nprocedure described in paras. 9-11.\n\n2.\n\nMonitoring Partner Agencies\n\n5.\nThe  invitation  and  proposal  submission  procedures  for  MOPAs  are  the  same  as  those\nfor  INGOs,  except  that  MOPAs  will  be  contracted  for  the  entire  project  period  without  a\nprobation year.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nC.\n\nEvaluation of Proposals from INGOs and MOPAs\n\n6.\nThe evaluation committee appointed by DNFE will evaluate the proposals on the basis of\nthe  eligibility  criteria  and  with  reference  to  assessment  guidelines  established  by  the  PIMU.  A\nproposal will be rejected at this stage and will not be considered for detailed evaluation if it does\nnot meet the eligibility criteria or the set standards of the guidelines.\n\n7.\nDetailed evaluation of the proposals of the eligible INGOs and MOPAs will be carried out\nonly  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  and  the  evaluation  criteria  described  below.

After\nreview  by  the  subvention  subcommittee,  DNFE  will  submit  the  evaluation  report  to  ADB  for\nreview,  including  the  list  of  technically  qualified  NGOs  and  MOPAs,  together  with  their\nscores/ranking. After ADB\u2019s no objection to the evaluation report, the subvention committee, in\naccordance with section D, will finally select INGOs and MOPAs and allocate contract packages\nto them.\n\nD.\n\nDetermination of Award of Contracts\n\nThe subvention subommittee will decide the maximum number of contract packages to\n\n9.\nbe awarded to a NGO or any other service provider on the basis of the following:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nScore\nAvailability of contract packages\nNumber of contract packages applied for\nPreferred areas\nEquity considerations (inclusion of substantial number of eligible NGOs and other\nnonformal education providers)\n\n10.\nThe contracting criteria will be different for INGOs and MOPAs. MOPAs do not have to\nbe  providers  of  NFE.  They  are  specialist  consultancy  firms  involved  in  baseline  and  impact\nstudies,  and  quality  M&E.  It  will  be  necessary  for  PIMU  to  create  a  separate  points  scoring\nsystem for MOPAs.\n\n11.\nFor INGOs renewing their contract after the initial one-year probation period, the scoring\nsystem, plus a M&E report from the concerned MOPA will be used to justify an extension of the\ncontract for the remaining period of project implementation.\n\nE.\n\nMonitoring of Performance\n\nEligibility  and  evaluation  criteria  (where  applicable)  will  also  be  used  for  M&E  of  the\n12.\nperformance of partner agencies. Noncompliance will lead to the rejection of their annual action\nplans, thus leaving them without funding. Such partner agencies will be replaced by preselected\nagencies  on  the  reserve  list,  which  will  be  asked  to  submit  an  action  plan.  The  procedure\ndescribed in section C will apply to these partner agencies.\n\nF.\n\nAdjusting Eligibility and Evaluation Criteria\n\nEligibility and evaluation criteria can be refined any time the Government, ADB, and the\n13.\nDepartment for International Development (DFID) mutually agree to do so. The comprehensive\nproject review at the end of the second year of project implementation and the midterm review\nconstitute appropriate times to adjust the criteria, if deemed necessary.\n\n\fPHYSICAL TARGETS AND PLANNING PARAMETERS\n\n46\n\nAppendix 4\n\nUnit\n\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6\n\nTotal\n\nQuantity\n\nCategory\nA.

The  joint  secretary  of  the  Primary  and  Mass\nEducation  Division  (PMED)  acts  as  the  WID  focal  point  and  is  assisted  by  an  associate  WID\nofficer  with  the  rank  of  senior  associate  chief  in  PMED.  A  sub-WID  focal  point  within  the\nResearch and Documentation Unit of the Diretorate of Nonformal Education (DNFE) is charged\nwith assisting the WID officers.2 Within DNFE, however, there is little awareness of this role, its\npotential, or what is needed to make it effective.\n\n2.\nThe  Government  approved  a  national  action  plan  (NAP)  for  women\u2019s  advancement  in\n1997. This plan foresees the  increase in number of female officers at all levels, particularly at\nthe  decision-making  and  management  levels  in  both  ministries  charged  with  education  in\nBangladesh  (Ministry  of  Education  and  PMED).  Budget  allocations  for  women  and  girls  in\nspecific educational programs and projects are part of the plan. Action 14 of the plan envisages\nthe  strengthening  of  adult  education  programs  for  women  in  various  fields  through  nonformal\neducation (NFE). Activities to be undertaken under the plan are (i) assessing women\u2019s needs for\nlearning;  (ii)  reviewing  curricula,  methods,  and  education  materials  of  existing  programs  and\nmodifying them to fulfill the needs of women and to increase the areas and coverage and; (iii)\nincorporating  gender  relations,  legal  literacy,  human  rights,  health  care  and  other  important\nissues in the program. DNFE is vested with primary responsibility for implementing this part of\nthe plan.\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  partnership  agreement  on  poverty  reduction\n3.\nwith  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  stresses  its  assistance  in  the  social  sectors,  targeted  at\nreducing  human  poverty  with  particular  emphasis  on  women,  specifically  mentions  projects  in\nNFE. ADB\u2019s gender strategy for Bangladesh includes supporting women\u2019s access to resources\nand services and promoting women\u2019s employment and income generation (footnote 1).\n\n4.\nWith  education  receiving  a  high  proportion  of  total  expenditure  for  the  social  sector,  a\nconsiderable increase in female enrollment at the primary school level has been achieved. The\ngender gap at this level decreased from 22 percent in 1985 to 3 percent over the past 15 years.\nProgress  at  the  secondary  education  level  has  been  slow  and  female  drop-out  rates  are\nalarmingly  high.  However,  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  girls\u2019  education  and  specific\nprograms for eradicating female illiteracy are encouraging more gender equity.\n\n5.\nDespite  these  achievements,  women\u2019s  access  to  education  including  NFE  remains\nseriously affected by sociocultural values, norms, and traditions. Preference for male children is\nan obvious cultural trait in Bangladesh as it is in other South Asian countries. Parents believe\nthat investment in a son\u2019s education yields a higher return since the boy is socially expected to\nlook them when they are old. Girls are perceived as homemakers, and rural parents emphasize\nteaching girls the basic skills for efficient performance of the domestic role. The prevalence of\n\n                                                          \n1  Women in Bangladesh. Country Briefing Paper, Asian Development Bank. 2001. Manila, January.

Low  levels  of  literacy  and  education\namong the parents further compound these attitudes.\n\n65\n\n6.\nIn  addition  to  these  cultural  dimensions,  poverty  is  causing  a  breakdown  in  the  social\nfabric of society. Levels of violence and desertion are increasing; divorce and widowhood cause\npoverty to women who become head of households with diminished resources often including\nthe loss of land or homestead. The absolute poverty of many female heads of households (95\npercent of whom fall into this category of the very poor) mean that they tend to overcome the\ncultural  restrictions  on  movement  and  are  forced  to  work  outside  the  home  and  to  migrate  for\nwork  on  a  seasonal  basis.  Poverty  requires  girls  to  engage  in  gainful  employment  early.\nParticularly  in  rural  areas,  women  are  in  charge  of  substantial  contributions  to  the  household\nincome  through  time-consuming  tasks  in  postharvest  activities,  vegetable  and  fruit  cultivation,\nfood preservation, animal husbandry, and home-based crafts. Absence of time- or labor-saving\ntechnology  compels  mothers  to  require  their  daughters  to  carry  a  substantial  load  of  the\ndomestic  chores.  In  addition,  mothers  often  suffer  from  ill  health  due  to  frequent  pregnancies,\nchildbirth, malnutrition, and environmentally caused diseases.\n\nDespite these obstacles, women\u2019s involvement in basic literacy programs seems to have\n7.\nbeen generally positive.  Evidence from different projects3 indicates that women are less likely to\ndrop  out  from  the  course,  and  are  more  consistent  and  more  committed  attendees  than  men.\nIncreased  mobility  within  the  community  and  the  social  interaction  that  takes  place  during  the\nbasic  literacy  courses  certainly  represent  a  benefit  for  women.  There  is  evidence4  to  suggest\nthat women (and their families) have benefited greatly from the social and life skills elements of\ntraining  courses  as  reflected  in  improvements  in  health,  hygiene,  and  school  attendance  and\nbetter  understanding  of  law  and  advocacy  issues.    Selecting  useful  and  appropriate  course\ntopics that respond to market demands takes place in respective localities and at a convenient\ntime becomes key issues for poor female and male participants.\n\n8.\nAs  an  equal  opportunity  provider,  DNFE  is  committed  to  ensure  gender  equality  in  all\nareas  of  NFE5  and  has  made  efforts  to  recruit  local  female  teachers  and  encourage  the\nrecruitment of female supervisors. A domestic gender consultant has been working with DNFE,\nunder  Swedish  International  Development  Agency  (Sida)  assistance,  to  formulate  a  gender\naction  plan  for  DNFE.6  Under  the  Project,  a  social  development  and  gender  specialist\n(international consultant), appointed for a period of two years, will report to the project director\nand  be  an  active  member  of  the  project  implementation  management  unit  (PIMU).  The\nconsultant  will  be  responsible  for  working  closely  with  the  WID  officers  to  build  institutional\ncapacity  in  poverty  reduction  strategies,  and  gender  analysis  and  training  within  DNFE  and  to\nensure  that  poverty  and  gender  concerns  are  adequately  addressed  by  implementing\nnongovernment  organizations  (INGOs)  and  monitoring  partner  agencies  (MOPAs)  across  all\nproject processes and activities. This social development officer will be responsible for ensuring\nthat monitoring and evaluation efforts explicitly measure project impact on diverse social groups\nand  are  disaggregated  by  gender  and  age,  for  use  in  designing  and  guiding  action  research\nstudies.  The  results  will  also  help  DNFE  to  formulate  a  coherent  and  practical,  collaborative\ngender strategy for the Project that builds on previous efforts in gender and NFE and that finds\nwide acceptance with other partners involved in NFE in Bangladesh.\n\n                                                          \n3 Draft  Report  of  BAN-2534  First  Nonformal  Education  Program  Manila  2001;  23  NGOs  Pilot  PLCE  Program,\n\nSWEDEC.

Consequently,  older  and  poorer  women  who  may  be\nburdened with children are passed over. This appears to be justified as long-term benefits from\nthe  program  and  employment  opportunities  are  higher  for  younger  woman.  Younger  people\ngenerally tend to learn faster than older learners, have more energy and less demands on their\ntime. Many of these girls though intellectually capable have never gone to school.\n\n10.\nHowever,  if  focus  is  on  those  most  in  need  and  on  the  poorest  and  least  advantaged\npeople,  older  women  would  be  a  key  target  group.    Changes  in  their  lives  and  economic\nsituation will affect many people within their families.  They also carry more weight in terms of\nchanging  attitudes  and  tradition  of  family  members  and  their  immediate  environment.  This\nsuggests that a wider concept of inclusiveness may include the provision of child care, allowing\nmothers  to  participate  in  PLCE  courses  and  generate  income  for  female  caretakers  in  the\nvillage.\n\n11.\nA  large  proportion  of  NGOs  are  concentrating  on  women\u2019s  issues.  NGOs  have  had  a\nconsiderable  impact  on  women\u2019s  development  in  the  fields  of  NFE,  health,  and  social\nawareness. NGOs have contributed by \u201cinsistence on the participatory process of development\n(planning, decision making, implementation, monitoring, evaluation) (as this) empowers women\nby dramatically highlighting their inclusion in all phases of a project. It also builds their capacity\nand  skill  in  public  participation  and  management\u201d  (footnote  1).  The  Project\u2019s  approach  in\nimplementing  PLCE  courses  through  NGOs  should  therefore  have  a  positive  impact  on  the\nconsideration of gender issues for both course arrangements and course contents.\n\nC.\n\nProject Gender Strategy and Plan\n\nThe Project\u2019s support for developing and formulating a gender strategy and plan should\n12.\nhelp  increase  gender  awareness  in  DNFE  and  ensure  women\u2019s  active  involvement  in  PLCE,\nincluding their direct access to project benefits. The objectives of the gender strategy are to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nensure that DNFE\u2019s commitment to equity is operationalized in the field through\nadequate attention to the gender aspects of staffing, implementation processes,\nquality of monitoring, and research studies and evaluations; and\n\nfeed into a wider collaborative strategy for the NFE sector that is prepared jointly\nby DNFE, aid agencies, NGOs and private sector providers and that is practical\nand achievable.\n\n13.\nThe gender strategy and plan will be to build on earlier efforts to define a broad strategy\nfor  the  NFE  subsector  as  a  whole  that  can  then  be  distilled  further  into  a  detailed  project\nstrategy for PLCE. Extensive consultations with the various aid agencies and NGOs involved in\nNFE - Sida, Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), the World Bank (WB), Department\nFor  International  Development  (DFID),  ADB,  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee\n(BRAC),  Reflect,  domestic  gender  consultants  engaged  in  the  sector,  private  sector  training\nproviders, and polytechnics and training institutes \u2013 will yield lessons from earlier and ongoing\ninitiatives in NFE. The Project will also seek to learn from similar initiatives in other sectors that\nare  working  closely  with  the  Government7  and  with  previous  DNFE  initiatives  including  the\nSida/NORAD-funded Local Gender Consultancy (LGC) whose main task was to build capacity\n\n                                                          \n7  Gender  strategy  formulation  under  HSPSP,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency\u2013funded  PLAU  and\n\nPLAGE.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\nin  the  DNFE  to  include  and  promote  gender  development  issues  in  its  project.8  Although  61\nDNFE  officials  were  trained  under  this  initiative  by  the  LGC,  a  large  proportion  have\nsubsequently  been  transferred.9  The  Project  will  see  to  it  that  the  gains  from  this  initiative  are\nconsolidated, lessons learned and any subsequent initiatives synergized to avoid duplication or\nparallel  efforts  toward  the  same  objectives.  The  strategy  will  be  formulated  during  the\npreparatory  phase  of  the  Project  through  a  series  of  consultations  and  workshops.  Senior\nDNFE, PMED, and MOWCA officials will participate in all phases of formulation so as to ensure\na sense of ownership and commitment at the highest levels.\n\n14.\nThe  strategy  will  disaggregate  the  age  group  of  11\u201345,  by  gender,  age,  geographic\nlocation, caste and religion, occupation, income, and literacy status and use this information to\nensure  that  action  plans  submitted  by  INGOs  are  relevant,  cost-effective,  and  inclusive.  The\ngender  strategy  will  pay  particular  attention  to  the  adolescent  age  group  and  link  up  with\nnetworks  and  NGOs  working  with  adolescent  girls  and  boys  in  Bangladesh  to  complement\nexisting efforts.10 By the same token, efforts will be made to ensure that older men and women\nlearners are not discriminated against in the design or delivery of these courses. WID officers, in\nconjunction  with  the  social  development  and  gender  specialist,  will  also  draw  on  initiatives  in\nother  sectors  and  collaborate  closely  with  MOWCA  and  other  ministries  and  departments\nincluding  Agriculture  and  Fisheries,  Rural/Urban  Development,  Department  of  Manpower  and\nTraining, Department of Youth Development, and Ministry of Labour, as appropriate, to ensure\nsynergies and avoid duplication of efforts.\n\nThe  gender  strategy  will  incorporate  the  findings  from  studies  carried  out  during  the\n15.\npreparatory  phase  of  the  Project  regarding  to  access  of  disadvantaged  neo-literates,  the\nmethodologies  that  various  NGOs  employ  for  overcoming  access  constraints,  innovative\nmethods  that  have  worked  in  retaining  learners  and  where  these  have  translated  into  gains\nbeyond  increased  income  of  households  (Table  A10).    A  study  that  reviewed  the  23  pilot\nprojects\u2019  report  from  the  gender  perspective  concluded  that  although  household  income\nincreased  as  a  result  of  skills  training,  in  traditional  areas  such  as  livestock  raising,  food\nprocessing and sewing/tailoring, these occupations confined women in the private arena11 and\ndid little to link them with the market. Where women engaged in new skills such as vegetable\ncultivation,  fisheries,  mushroom  farming,  batik  and  candle  making,  the  biggest  constraint  was\nlack  of  market  accessibility.  The  market  research  linked  to  the  identification  of  skills  training,\nparticularly as regards new and non-traditional skills, will need to focus on the various elements\nthat  must  complement  the  skills  training  so  as  to  deliver  positive  outcomes  (increased\nconfidence,  consolidation  of  skills  or  trade,  and  ability  to  sustain  this  skill  through  market\nlinkages, start-up capital, control over increased incomes).\n\nPLCE courses of the Project are envisaged to be delivered entirely by NGOs. Program\n16.\nimplementation quality will vary due to many factors including capacity of the INGO, availability\nand skills of local facilitators and resource persons, learning conditions including learner profiles\n                                                          \n8 Progress Report of the Local Gender Consultancy (LGC) for NFE Projects, DNFE/Government of Bangladesh.

Training in participatory rapid\nappraisal (PRA) and promoting participatory procedures will\nensure  that  women  become  involved  in  course  selection,\nand  evaluating  course  relevance  and  learners\u2019  satisfaction.\nOf the 2,800 teachers trained until the end of the Project, 50\npercent will be women.\n\nCurriculum  and  course  organization  will  take  account  of\nwomen\u2019s  pressures  regarding  time.  Self-learning  and  peer\ngroup learning as ways for catching up with missed classes\nwill  be  tested.  Organizing  informal  child  care  will  be\nencouraged to help mothers to attend courses and provide a\nmeans  of  generating  a  small \nfor  community\nmembers.  Course  locations  will  be  at  the  convenience  of\nwomen, considering their restricted mobility.\n\nincome \n\nGender awareness training will be provided for PIMU and for\ninvolved partner agencies; the Project\u2019s social development\nspecialist  will  ensure  integration  of  gender  issues  in  all\nphases and activities of the Project.\n\nVillage  profiling  in  the  preparation  phase  of  the  continuing\neducation  course  will  involve  both  men  and  women.  Needs\nassessments will be done separately with men and women.\nGeneral community orientations will be held before the start\nof  the  course  to  discuss  anxieties  and  possible  prohibitions\nexisting  in  more  remote  and  traditional  villages.  Age-group-\nrelated  needs  will  be  considered  in  the  course  content,\norganization,  and  timing.  Gender  audits  for  curriculum\nmaterials  and  training  for  gender  awareness  will  be  an\nintegral  part  of  all  courses.  At  least  50  percent  of  courses\ndeveloped will relate to women\u2019s needs, interests, and their\npotential income-generating activities. The Government has\nagreed to a minimum enrollment rate of at least 50 percent\nwomen.\n\n\fComponent/Activitiy\n\nApproach and Target\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n69\n\nA  gender-disaggregated \nis\nconducted  prior  to  midterm  review  of  the  Project.  One\nindicator  will  be  that  20  percent  of  female  learners  have\nselected courses in nontraditional skills.\n\nlearner  satisfaction  survey \n\n50 percent of third party district monitoring associates will be\nwomen,  ensuring  the  accuracy  of  gender  disaggregated\ndata  and  the  regular  monitoring  of  attention  to  gender  and\ninclusiveness issues.\n\nD.\n\nGender Impact\n\nit  was  obvious \n\nin  regional  workshops, \n\nExisting studies as well as the field visits conducted during project preparation indicate\n17.\nthat female neo-literates scored generally higher in course achievement than men. Women are\nmore  vocal  and  confident  in  expressing  their  views  about  the  basic  literacy  courses.  Both  in\nvillages  and \nthe  newly  elected  women\nrepresentatives on Union Parishads12 have a vital role in making the voice of women heard in\nthe community.  A number of women who completed the literacy course have become involved\nin  community  activities.  Informed  and  socially  aware  women  often  take  on  leadership  roles\nwithin the family and the community. There is evidence (footnote 4) to suggest that women (and\ntheir  families)  have  benefited  greatly  from  the  social  and  life  skills  elements  in  the  continuing\neducation  courses  as  reflected  in  improvements  in  health,  hygiene,  school  attendance,  and\nunderstanding of law and advocacy issues.  Women who are literate have smaller families, tend\nto marry later or marry their daughters later, practice good health and hygiene, and support the\neducation of their children.\n\nthat \n\n18.\nSome of the women\u2019s biggest gain from the basic literacy program is the ability to read\ntheir children\u2019s schoolbooks, help with homework, and visit the school without embarrassment.\nMechanical  jobs,  such  as  welding  or  house  electrification,  have  been  successfully  learned  by\nwomen and produce a higher income with less stress than some of the conventional women\u2019s\ncourses  like  embroidery  or  sewing.    This  impact  will  be  further  enhanced  through  the  courses\nprovided  by  the  Project.  Encouraging  small-scale  agricultural  activities  will  lead  to  better\nnutrition and selling of surpluses within the village or beyond.  Waged employment at industrial\nor business enterprises within the same village will be another option, that needs to be explored\nby  market  surveys.  Increased  mobility  within  the  community  and  social  interaction  during\ntraining courses will be supported by PLCE programs to be offered in the context of the Project.\n\n                                                          \n12 Unions consist of cluster of villages with some devolved political and administrative functions. Union Parshad is the\n\nunion council.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Rationale\n\n1.\nThe economic rationale for the Project derives from both economic efficiency and equity.\nThe efficiency issue arises from the fact that continuing education and training in Bangladesh,\nespecially in rural areas, is either absent or under-supplied. The argument for a proactive role\nfor  public  interventions  is  that  while  basic-level  continuing  education  and  training  activities  are\nmostly  in  the  nature  of  public  goods  and  have  large  externalities,  they  are  characterized  by\nuncertainty  and  incomplete  information,  leading  to  a  poor  supply  response  from  the  private\nsector.\n\n2.\nThe equity issue arises from the equitable provision of \u201cmerit wants\u201d to reduce poverty. While\nBangladesh  has  achieved  successful  economic  growth  in  recent  years,  such  growth  has  not\nbenefited the poor, due to the wide and steadily widening inequality in the distribution of incomes.\nThe  unskilled  poor  living  in  rural  areas,  and  especially  the  women,  do  not  have  sufficient  human\ncapital  to  benefit  from  the  opportunities  created  by  the  country\u2019s  gradual  process  of  economic\nmodernization. The Project will assist the Government in reducing poverty by improving the literacy\nand income-related skills of the rural poor.\n\nB.\n\nDemand Indication\n\nThe first tracer study carried out as part of the first nonformal education (NFE) project in\n3.\nBangladesh surveyed 1,480 NFE graduates (82 percent of them women and 75 percent of them\nin  the  14-25  age  group)  and  concluded:  \u201cLiteracy  graduates  increased  their  participation  in\neconomic activities, cash savings, loan seeking behavior, and participation in loan programs.  In\naddition, a greater percentage of graduates are sending their children to school, participating in\ncommunity groups and support activities, and using birth control methods.\u201d\n\nWhile the tracer study does not include hard data that are adequate to demonstrate explicit\n4.\ndemand  by  direct  beneficiaries,  their  demand  is  considered  to  be  indirectly  reflected  in  the  large\ninternational literature relating to private rates of return to investment in education. This approach has\nits critics, due to the inherent problems in the methods used, since the calculations are subject to a\nnumber  of  technical  assumptions.  But  no  better  alternative  has  been  found.  A  recent  publication\nquoted private rates of return to formal education in Bangladesh ranging from 15 percent for upper\nsecondary  education  to  45  percent  for  primary  education.1  Using  the  same  cost-benefit  analysis,\nstudies of NFE have been carried out in a number of other countries and indicative results show very\nhigh rates of return, both to the individuals (private rates of return) and to the economy (social rates of\nreturn).2 The beneficiary demand is particularly supported by the advantage of NFE: the students can\nparticipate  on  a  part-time  basis  so  that  they  are  still  able  to  continue  with  their  income-earning  or\ndomestic  activities  for  their  families,  that  is,  there  are  only  minimal  opportunity  costs  to  the\nhouseholds.\n\n5.\nIn terms of gender impact, the data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey\n1996/97 indicate that education investments have significant differential welfare impacts in favor of\nwomen. The higher a woman goes up the educational ladder, the better she and her family score on\nmost health and family welfare indicators. Women who obtain more education are more likely to work\nin skilled occupations, have greater access to media services, have lower fertility levels, have greater\nawareness  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  such  as  human  immunodeficiency  virus,  and  their\nchildren  are  less  likely  to  die  young.  If  all  of  these  effects  could  be  captured  in  rates  of  return\n\n                  \n\n1  K. Tanaka and A. Hussain. 1999. Quoted in World Bank. 2001. Bangladesh Education Sector Review. The analysis was\nbased on data in 1995/96. The findings are in line with the international evidence from rates of return calculations in many\nother countries, which show that returns are higher at the level of basic education, lower from higher levels of education\n(e.g., G. Psacharopoulos, World Bank, various dates).\n\n2  Cited from the TA Final Report submitted to ADB Pakistan Nonformal Education for Rural Women, 2000.\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 2\ncalculations, which typically they are not, the effect would be to significantly increase the rate of return\nto the education of females.\n\n71\n\nC.\n\nCost-Effectiveness\n\n6.\nAccording  to  the  Nonformal  Education  Sector  study  completed  as  part  of  project\npreparation  in  2001,  the  cost  per  learner  on  NFE  literacy  programs  varies  by  length  of  the\nprogram  and  by  the  components  provided  (e.g.,  length  of  teacher  training)  but  the  cost  per\nlearner  is  higher  for  center-based  approach  (CBA)  programs  (around  $12)  and  lower  for  total\nliteracy  movement  (TLM)  programs  ($5).  The  24-month  program  for  hard-to-reach  urban\nchildren  has  significantly  higher  costs  per  learner  ($43).  (The  estimate  figures  were  originally\nmade  by  DNFE.)  Unfortunately,  however, \nindicators.\nPerformance data showing outcomes is lacking, especially the learning outcomes from different\nNFE approaches and programs.  Data gathered on project preparatory technical assistance field\nvisits  to  rural  areas  suggested  that  learning  outcomes  from  CBA  courses  may  be  significantly\nhigher than what the cost-per-learner indicators suggest. While clear comparison is impossible,\nit appears that CBA courses may be equally justified relative to TLM courses. Although  learning\nachievements have not been well assessed, some can be safely assumed.\n\nthese  are  only  cost-per-learner \n\nD.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n7.\nThe analysis here estimates the internal rate of return (IRR) for the Project based on the\nincremental wage benefits due to the newly acquired skills. As external benefits that accrue to\nthe society are difficult to ascertain, they are not included. Therefore, the IRR here represents\nprivate  rate  of  return  captured  by  direct  beneficiaries  only.  The  assumptions  for  the  analysis\nwere  formed  after  discussions  with  DNFE  staff  and  with  local  counterparts.  The  base  case\nassumptions are set out as follows.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  project  capital  and  recurrent  costs  are  spread  over \nthe  six-year\nimplementation  period,  while  the  project  benefits  in  the  form  of  higher  (self)\nemployability are assumed to continue for 10 years after the end of the Project.\nOf the trainees, 90 percent will complete the training courses.\nOf the completers, 90 percent will be employed or self-employed for 20 days per\nmonth  and  six  months  per  year  on  the  average.  These  numbers  of  days  and\nmonths are set conservatively, allowing for intermittent self-employment.\nIncremental daily wage due to the completion of project courses will be $0.25 per\nday.  This  is  based  on  the  wage  data  gathered  from  national  statistics  and  from\nfield visits to rural villages. Such data showed that an unskilled worker acquiring\nsome skill could raise his/her daily wage rate by an average of Tk20.00 per day,\nor $0.35 per day. Based on this, the base case assumption takes a conservative\nestimate of $0.25 per day.\nThe number of trainees at full development in year 6 totals 1.6 million. They will\nbuild  up  gradually  from  the  year  2  of  project  implementation:  year  2,  1  percent;\nyear  3,  8  percent;  year  4,  34  percent;  year  5,  67  percent,  and  year  6,  100\npercent.\nEconomic benefits accruing to trainers/instructors are assumed.\n\n8.\nBased on the assumptions, the base-case internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated to be\n35.3  percent  (Table  A11.1).  As  there  is  much  uncertainty  about  the  various  assumptions,\nsensitivity analysis is warranted to test the robustness of the economic viability with respect to\nvarious adverse scenarios. Three scenarios were prepared. First, under the low-wage scenario\nof  the  incremental  daily  wage  at  $0.15  instead  of  $0.25,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return\n(EIRR) is reduced to 20.3 percent (Table A11.2). Second, under the low-employment scenario,\nwith  the  employment  rate  at  60  percent  instead  of  90  percent,  the  EIRR  is  increased  to  23.0\npercent (Table A11.3). Therefore, the project viability is robust in these two adverse scenarios.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\nFinally,  a  switching  scenario  was  simulated  (Table  A11.4).  It  shows  that  a  reduction  of\nincremental daily wage to $0.15, and at the same time, a reduction of employment rate to 62.5\npercent  will  make  the  Project  nonviable.  As  the  base  case  assumptions  have  been  set\nconservatively, such switching scenario is unlikely.\n\nE.\n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\n9.\nTo  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  activities,  the  Government  and\ncommunities  or  beneficiaries  must  be  able  to  provide  and  allocate  the  necessary  recurrent\ncosts.  The existing evidence may be summarized as follows: (i) regarding costs falling on the\nGovernment, the Government has for some years demonstrated its commitment to funding NFE\nby  steadily  increasing  year  by  year  the  proportion  of  the  total  education  budget  allocated  to\nNFE;  (ii)  communities  at  subdistrict  and  village  levels  have  demonstrated  their  willingness  to\ncontribute in kind to the success of education and training activities by working to renovate and\nupgrade  existing  facilities  and  by  providing  some  of  the  resources,  e.g.  sitting  mats;  and  (iii)\nregarding  cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries,  there  is  evidence  that  participants  in  continuing\neducation activities are prepared to contribute to the cost of training activities that they perceive\nas directly related to income-enhancing possibilities. In one pilot under the Project\u2019s first phase,\nit would be desirable to test out partial cost recovery with funds managed at the village level and\nused  to  purchase  training  independently.  This  would  be  carried  out  after  careful  analysis  of\noptions based on similar attempts in Bangladesh. Apart from training, another possibility might\nbe to encourage the start of a group savings scheme within an established continuing education\ncenter that would raise money to purchase, from the private sector, microenterprise marketing\nand business development support services.\n\n10.\nNotwithstanding the various considerations under the Project that will contribute to cost\nrecovery, it is meaningful to examine the fiscal affordability of the project recurrent costs. Table\nA11.5  shows  an  indicative  comparison  of  the  projection  of  the  government  budget  availability\nand the project recurrent expenditure estimate. The assumptions behind this simulation are as\nfollows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nno changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from the current 5\npercent,\nno change in the government expenditure share in GDP at 13.6 percent,\nno  change  in  the  education  expenditure  share  in  the  total  government\nexpenditure at 15 percent,\nno  change  in  the  NFE  expenditure  share  in  total  education  expenditure  at  3.9\npercent,\nproject recurrent expenditure rising to peak in 2005/06, then declining in 2006/07.\n\n11.\nBased on the assumptions, at the peak of the project recurrent expenditure in 2005/06,\nits share in the government NFE expenditure will be about 28 percent and then will decline to\n21.5 percent at the end of the project implementation period. Since the present DNFE programs\nconsisting  of  basic  literacy  and  post-literacy  courses  will  largely  have  been  concluded,  the\nrequired  level  of  project  recurrent  expenditure  should  be  sustainable  at  this  level  under  this\nscenario.  The  fiscal  implication  beyond  the  project  implementation  period  will  depend  on\nwhether similar investments will be made in the NFE sector and in what size, in the NFE sector\nand is outside the scope of the analysis here.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nTable A11.1: EIRR Estimation for Base Case Scenario\n($)\nBenefits\nof\nTrainees\n\nPV Factor\nat\n12 percent\n\nNet
