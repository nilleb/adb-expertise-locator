It  connects  Central  Asia  to  Europe,  the \nRussian Federation, and Turkey. The subregion, once part of the \nhistoric Silk Road, is becoming a transit route for crude oil exports. \nIt  has  the  potential  to  become  an  established  business,  logistics, \nand  transit  hub.  But  to  tap  this  potential,  it  first  needs  to  expand \nand  improve  its  transport  network,  including  roads,  railways,  and \nports. \n \nThe  Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra  road  crosses  Armenia  from \nsouth  to  north,  and  then  connects  to  Georgia's  southern  road \ncorridor, reaching the ports of Poti and Batumi in the Black Sea in \nthe  west, and  Tbilisi  in  the  east.  This  corridor  complements  the \neast\u2013west  highway  being  reconstructed  between  Azerbaijan  and \nGeorgia. \n \nArmenia  and  Georgia  have  requested  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to  cofinance  the \nreconstruction  of  the  corridor.  ADB  proposes  to  support  the \nreconstruction  of  this  corridor  through  separate  multitranche \nfinancing  facilities  (MFFs).  ADB  is  also  financing  investments  in \nthe  Azerbaijan  section  of  the  Azerbaijan  to  Georgia  corridor.  \nCross-border and trade facilitation work is being developed under \nthe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  program.  The \nimplementation of the physical infrastructure will be accompanied \nby  technical  assistance  to  be  separately  prepared  for  this \npurpose. \n \nThe  North\u2013South  Road  Corridor \nInvestment  Program  (the \nInvestment  Program) \nin  Armenia  combines  physical  and \ninvolves \nnonphysical \nimprovement of various sections along the route. The nonphysical \ncomponent  targets  institutional  effectiveness,  including  better \n\ninvestments.  The  physical  component \n\n \n\n\fii \n \n \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility Proposal \n\n \n \n\nsafeguards \nresults \n\nreporting,  evaluation,  and \n\nplanning,  maintenance,  project  management, \ncompliance,  monitoring, \nmeasurement. \n \nTranche 1 Project will (i) reconstruct an 18.4 kilometer (km) four-\nlane  section  of  the  corridor  between  Yerevan  and  Ashtarak,  (ii) \nimprove  road  safety  for  the  Yerevan\u2013Ararat  road,  (iii)  prepare \ndesign and bidding documents for tranche 2 and 3, and (iv) help \nimplement  the  road  subsector  plan  under  the  Transport  Sector \nStrategy. \n \nThe  Government  requests  ADB  to  help  finance  the  Investment \nProgram through an MFF up to the equivalent of $500 million. The \nfinancing  will  be  in  the  form  of  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR) and Special Funds resources. The MFF will be structured \naround  multiple  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  by  the  Government  and \nexecution  of  related  loan  agreements  and  other  warranties  and \nrepresentations. \n \nThe Government will enter into a framework financing agreement \n(FFA)  with  ADB.  The  first  tranche  amounts  to  $60  million  to  be \nfinanced  from  the  Special  Funds  resources.  The  first  PFR  is \npresented to the Board together with this report and the FFA. \n \nThe MFF is considered a suitable modality in this case on account \nof the following: \n \n(i)  The  size  of  the  Investment  Program  is  large  and  needs  a \nfinancing  scheme  that  offers  greater  flexibility,  predictability \nand  continuity.  The  MFF  offers  these  elements  better  than \nstand-alone or program loan lending modalities of ADB. \nlong \n\n(ii)  The  MFF  demands  sound  platform \n\nterm \npartnership  in  the  sector  that  combines  project  finance, \nmanagement  and  support  for  institutional  efficiency.  The \nGovernment  has  developed  such  sector  strategy,  policy \nframework  and  road  map.  These  will  require  strengthening \nover time but the basic elements are in place, thus meeting \nthe principal MFF criteria. \n\nfor  a \n\n(iii)  The MFF provides financing stability for a long term program. \nIt also allows the Government and ADB to finance more than \none sector at a time. The current business plan covers roads, \nurban  services  and  reforms.  Given  the  limited  financing \nenvelope  but  multiple  needs,  the  MFF  allows  funding  to  be \nstructured around both priorities and project readiness. \n(iv)  The  MFF  front-loads  a  critical  analytical  work  at  the  start, \nthus placing greater emphasis on implementation. Financing \nwill be matched closely to project readiness as the previous \ntranche allocates enough resources to prepare the next one \n(including  design  work).  This  helps  speed  up  contract \nawards, disbursements, and results. \n\n\f \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan  \n\n \n\niii\n\n \nRehabilitation  of  the  road  network  is  a  top  priority  for  Armenia. \nImproving  logistics  increases  trade,  investment  flows  and  jobs.  \nBetter  connectivity  aids  regional  cooperation  and  integration  and \nincreases the country's competitiveness. This Investment Program \ncomplements  similar  ones  in  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia  supported \nby ADB. It fits within ADB's Strategy 2020, and is part of country \noperations  business  plan.  It  is  also  aligned  to  the  regional \nthe \ncooperation  economic  program \nCaucasus.  The  corridor  provides  Central  Asian  countries  with \nimproved access to the ports of Poti and Batumi and connects the \nCaspian Sea to the Black Sea.  \n \nThe Investment Program will contribute to economic development \nand regional trade. The outcome will be a more efficient, safer and \nsustainable transport network. \n \nThe  Investment  Plan  is  estimated  at  $962  million.  The  share \nassigned  to  ADB  over  the  next  few  years  is  $500  million.

PGC is cochaired by \nthe  ministers  of  economy  and  transport  and  communication.  Its \nkey  functions  include  (i)  guiding  overall  policy  and  strategic \ndirections,  (ii)  reviewing  performance,  and  (iii)  coordinating  with \nother projects financed by other development partners. \n \nImplementation and monitoring will be delegated to the Armenian \nRoads  Directorate  (ARD),  which  will  serve  as  the  implementing \nagency.  ARD  will  set  up  a  program  management  unit  (PMU)  to \nhandle all day-to-day execution tasks, including (i) screening and \napproving  individual  tranche  projects;  (ii)  planning  and  executing \nprocurement;  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  final  project  designs; \n(iv)  managing  contractors  and  supervising  consultants;  (v) \nmaintaining  financial  management  controls,  including  project \naccounts; (vi) monitoring and reporting on project implementation \nperformance  and  results;  (vii)  dealing  with  all  warranties  and \nrepresentations  made  to  ADB,  including  full  compliance  with \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies and action plans; and \n(viii) managing the institutional effectiveness program. \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nAdvance Contracting and \nRetroactive Financing \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nSocial Safeguard \nAssessment \n\n \n\nv\n\n \nARD will procure works and goods to be financed under the MFF \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  A \nprocurement plan has been prepared for Tranche 1 Project. Civil \nworks  are  packaged  into  one  contract  to  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding. Small works costing less than $1 \nmillion,  although  not  anticipated  at  this  stage,  will  be  procured \nusing  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  National \ncompetitive  bidding  will  be  conducted  according  to  the  Law  on \nProcurement of Armenia (effected on 5 June 2000 and updated in \n2008),  subject  to  clarifications  and  modifications  as  agreed  with \nADB.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  require  consulting  services  to  (i) \nprepare detailed designs and supervise works; (ii) monitor project \nperformance,  including  benefits  and  safeguards  compliance;  and \n(iii)  help  prepare  and  implement  individual  tranche  projects. \nMOTC will select consulting firms and/or individuals in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection,  quality-based  selection,  or \nconsultants'  qualification  selection  method  depending  on  the \nneeds  of  individual  project  components  and  procurement  plan. \nADB  and  MOTC  will  undertake  appropriate  due  diligence  before \nusing  any  of  the  suggested  methods,  and  identify  a  suitable \nweighting system for evaluating the firms' proposals. \n \nTranche  1  Project  will  require  about  89  person-months  of \ninternational  and  296  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices  to  work  on  project  design  and  supervision  of  awarded \ncivil  works  contracts.  These  advisors  will  be  tasked  with  the \npreparation of investments under subsequent tranches. In addition \nto  these  services,  under  the  Tranche  1  Project,  the  Government \nwill  procure  the  services  of  international  (32  person-months)  and \nnational  (45  person-months)  experts  to  help  strengthen  a  road \nsubsector  plan  and  guide \nimplementation.  For  project \nits \nmanagement  and  administration,  ARD  will  recruit  a  team  of \nindividual consultants, which will be work in the PMU. \n \nTo  facilitate  project  implementation  the  Government  requested \nADB  approval  for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing \nfor works and consulting services.  \n \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the \nInvestment Program was prepared. Tranche 1 Project is classified \ncategory B. An initial environmental  examination was undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix G). \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C - limited or no impact \nIndigenous people: Category C - limited or no impact \nA  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix \n11.  This  is  based  on  consultations  during  the  preparation  of  the \n\n \n\n\fvi \n \n \n\n \nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\nInvestment Program and the Tranche 1 Project. \n \nThe Investment Program will benefit road users, road construction \ncompanies,  traders,  and  others  who  derive  income  from  the \ndevelopment  of  transport,  logistics  and  trade  along  the  road \ncorridor.  The  direct  benefits  include  (i)  lower  road  transport  and \nmaintenance  costs,  (ii)  faster  and  more  reliable  road  transport \nservices,  (iii)  reduced  traffic  accidents,  (iv)  improved  access  to \nmarkets  and  social  services,  and  (v)  jobs  and  income  created \nduring  implementation  (i.e.,  use  of  local  labor  and  construction \nmaterials) and after completion (i.e., roadside business activities). \nThe  direct  benefits  will  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and \noperators and road construction companies, but will ultimately be \nshared  with  passengers  and  freight  customers  through  reduced \nbus  fares  and  freight  charges.  While  Armenia  is  the  major \nbeneficiary,  other  countries  in  the  Caucasus  subregion  will  also \nbenefit  from  a  more  efficient  movement  of  traffic  to  and  via \nArmenia. Indirect benefits, which are expected to become tangible \nafter  the completion  of Tranche  1 Project,  include  improved  road \nnetwork management, and increased business activities and jobs \nthat have forward or backward links to the corridor. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by \nstimulating  economic  development.  This  will  benefit \nrural \ncommunities, especially the rural poor and women. In particular, it \nwill  increase  the  mobility  of  about  3  million  people  living  in  six \nmarzes (provinces), where the road corridor lies. \n \nThe  majority  of  women  in  the  program  areas  are  engaged  in \nagriculture-related  activities  or  with  small  and  medium-size  agro-\nindustries (including cottage industries). Reduced travel time and \nmore  available  transport  services  will  help  improve  the  lives  of \nthe  elderly,  and  children\u2014as \npeople\u2014especially  women, \nimproved  road  transport  under  the  Investment  Program  will \nincrease  their  access  to  the  nearest  markets  and  social  service \ndelivery, including schools, hospitals, and clinics. The investments \nwill  also  create  direct  employment  opportunities  in  industry  and \nservices. It is anticipated that greater road connectivity may have \na positive impact on less-educated girls and women by promoting \ntheir access to more education and training opportunities. \n \nArmenia  has  many  historical  sites  that  date  back  to  the  4th  and \n5th  centuries  and  are  home  to  Christian  shrines  and  places  of \nreligious worship. Jermuk and Tatev are the two tourism hot spots \nalong  the  north\u2013south  road  corridor.  These  attract  tourists  from \naround  the  world.  It  is  expected  that  the  corridor  will  promote \ntourism activities and socioeconomic development in the region. \n \nThe \nInvestment  Program  was  designed  with \nassumptions:  (i)  continued  Government  commitment \nconcept  of \n\nfollowing \nthe \ntransport  and  economic  corridors;  (ii)  efficient \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nimplementation of the sector strategy, policy framework and road \nmap;  (iii)  adequate  external  financial  resources;  (iv)  adequate \nroad  maintenance;  (v)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds;  and \n(vi) sound designs and civil works schedules and efficient MOTC's \ndiligent oversight of works and contracts. \n \nThe  main  risks  include  (i)  macroeconomic  instability  in  Armenia \nand  the  subregion  due  to  the  current  global  financial  crisis,  (ii) \nreduced  commitment  to  corridors  and  weak  implementation \ncapacity, and (iii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices. \nThe Government is committed to mitigate these risks.  \n \nThe  recent  macroeconomic  imbalances  are  being  corrected  with \nhelp  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  other \npartners  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  After  the  global \nfinancial  crisis  in  2008,  the  foreign  debt  of  Armenia  is  being \nclosely  monitored  by  external  aid  agencies,  especially  the  IMF. \nThe  latter  expects  that Armenia\u2019s debt  ratios will  rise  sharply\u2014\nalbeit  from  a  low  base\u2014with  the  ratio  of  public  debt  to  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  increasing  from  18%  in  2008  to  43% \nin  2010.  However,  the  debt\u2013GDP  level  is  not  projected  to  be \nexcessive.  Standard  stress  tests  show  that  Armenia  is  at  low \nrisk  of  debt  distress.  Economic  conditions  are  expected  to \nimprove by the end of 2010.  \n \nThe investment plan includes contingencies. The same applies to \nthe  financing  plan.  This  will  help  tackle  possible  cost  overruns \nand/or changes to the program and Tranche 1 Project. Tranche 1 \nProject  is  fairly  straightforward  and  unlikely  to  need  extra \nfinancing.  \n\n \n\n\fviii \n \n \nPROJECT MAP \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  cofinancing  that  may  be \nprovided by development partners under the MFF, to the Republic of Armenia for the North\u2013South \nRoad  Corridor  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).

It has the potential to \nbecome an established business, logistics and transit hub. But to tap this potential, it first needs \nto expand and improve its transport network, including roads, railways and ports. \n \nThe Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra road crosses Armenia from south to north, and then \n3. \nconnects to Georgia's southern road corridor, reaching the ports of Poti and Batumi in the Black \nSea  in  the  west, and  Tbilisi  in  the  east.  An  integrated  road  corridor  between  Armenia  and \nGeorgia  connects  not  only  these  two  countries,  but  also  complements  another  road  corridor \nbeing  developed  between  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia.  The  latter  is  already  under  reconstruction. \nADB is financing a share of the investments in the Azerbaijan section of the corridor. Given the \nsize  of  the  investments  in  Armenia  and  Georgia,  both  countries  have  approached  ADB  and \nother  development  partners  to  cofinance  the  new  corridor.  This  submission  covers  only  the \ninvestments in Armenia. A parallel proposal is being prepared for Georgia. \n \n \n \nArmenia is a mountainous landlocked country bordering Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and \n4. \nTurkey.  The  location  presents  an  opportunity  for  trade;  the  topography\u2014a  challenge.  The \ntransport infrastructure, built mostly under the former Soviet Union in 1960s\u20131970s, is in a poor \ncondition. This affects transit costs, competitiveness, trade, investment and job creation. \n \n5. \nArmenia  has  achieved  impressive  economic  recovery  since  independence.  Economic \nrecovery began in 1993, yielding annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.4% during \n1993\u20132000;  it  then  accelerated  to  double-digit  growth  during  2001\u20132007.  Transport  demand \ngrew  correspondingly  by  8%  in  terms  of  value  of  merchandise  exports  and  20%  for  imports \nduring  2003\u20132008.  Exports  are  predominantly  precious  stones  (principally  diamonds),  ferrous \nmetals, ore and beverages, accounting for about 70% of the total. Imports include mainly fuel, \nbitumen,  and  precious  stones  accounting  for  around  one-third  of  the  total.  The  Russian \nFederation, Kazakhstan and European countries are the main trading partners.  \n \nArmenia's  transport  policy  is  captured  in  the  National  Program  (2006\u20132009). 1  This \n6. \nsupports  a so-called  Partnership  and  Cooperation  Agreement  (PCA)  with  the  European  Union \n(EU) signed in 1996. But Armenia has ambitions not only to improve connectivity to Europe, but \n\nTrade and Transport \n\n2.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Armenia. 2006.

Armenia  has  signed  most  of  the  international  conventions  relating  to \ntransport and trade facilitation. It is expected to negotiate and sign a free trade agreement with \nthe EU in 2010 and looking into similar arrangements with Asia.  \n \nB.  \n \n7. \nThe  road  subsector  has  technical,  operational,  financial,  regulatory,  and  institutional \ndeficiencies. Combined, these lead to an inefficient, incomplete, and unsafe network of widely \nvariable quality. These problems can be addressed over time through targeted investments and \nreforms, including greater institutional effectiveness. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe road network in Armenia was developed mostly in the 1960s\u20131970s. The country is \nreasonably  well-connected  with  a  coverage  ratio  of  about  280  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  per \n1,000 square km (km2). The network is 7,704 km long (1,686 km of interstate roads, 4,056 km of \nrepublic roads, and 1,962 km of local roads). Road conditions vary among marzes (provinces), \nranging from only 10% being in good condition in some (Tavush) to 90% in others (Ararat and \nVayots  Dzor).  The  average  roughness  for  interstate  roads  is  about  5.0  meters  (m)  per  km \ninternational  roughness index  (IRI).  Lack  of  quality  control  during  construction  and inadequate \nmaintenance since independence has resulted in rapid deterioration of pavements. A large part \nof the road network is in a poor state of repair, with only about 15% of interstate and republic \nroads  in  good  condition.  The  north\u2013south  road  corridor  is  also  deteriorating  fast  and  cannot \nmeet  the  increasing  traffic  demand.  The  total  cost  of  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  is \nestimated  at  $1.5  billion\u2013$2.0  billion  up  to  2020.  External  assistance  has  helped  Armenia \nimprove  interstate  and  local  roads  since  1995,  but  pavements  that  were  not  rehabilitated  now \nrequire  full  reconstruction.  A  detailed  assessment  of  the  road  subsector,  including  a  problem \ntree analysis, is in Appendix 2. \n \n9. \nInternational  road  corridors  in  Armenia  are  substandard  and  do  not  comply  with  the \nrequirements of international agreements and conventions. For instance, Armenia is a signatory \nto the EU Agreement on Traffic Arteries2 that includes two roads in Armenia classified as \"the \ninternational  E-road  network.\"  These  are  routes  E117  and  E691.  They  form  the  north\u2013south \nroad corridor. The agreement stipulates minimum conditions to which the selected roads should \nconform  in  terms  of  classification,  geometric  standards,  road  safety  equipment,  environment \nand landscaping, and maintenance. \n \n\n2. \n\nCross-Border Traffic \n\n \n10. \nCross-border traffic has been increasing. It uses three main crossings: two with Georgia \n(Bagratashen  and  Bavra)  in  the  north,  and  one  with  Iran  (Mehri)  in  the  south.  Trucks  entering \nfrom Georgia come primarily from the Russian Federation, other Commonwealth of Independent \nStates countries, Europe, and Turkey. The average number of trucks entering Armenia daily in \n2007 was 84 from Iran and 114 from Georgia. In 2008, an average of 59 trucks per day entered \nfrom Georgia as transit traffic\u201447% from the port of Poti, 6% from the port of Batumi, and 40% \nfrom Sarpi (Georgia\u2013Turkey border). By comparison, only eight loaded trucks per day transited \nfrom Armenia through Georgia. Turkish trucks on the Transports Internationaux Routiers system \nenter Armenia through Georgia. \n \n\n                                                 \n2 United Nations. 1975. European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR). Washington, D.C. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n3. \n\nRoad Sector Management \n\n \n \n11. \nRoad  sector  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunication  (MOTC).  The  work  covers  strategy,  policy,  planning,  investment,  regulation, \nasset management, evaluation and results reporting. The Armenia Roads Directorate (ARD), a \nnoncommercial state organization, assists MOTC in managing the network, including designing \nand  implementing  projects  financed  by  external  aid  agencies.  In  the  case  of  government-\nfinanced road works, which are limited to rural and local roads, ARD is responsible for feasibility \nstudies  and  management  of  the  construction  and  periodic  maintenance  works  outsourced  to \nprivate  firms  through  competitive  bidding.  ARD  also  conducts  safety  audits  and  monitors \nenvironmental and social compliance requirements. ARD maintains a road inventory and traffic \ndatabase  and  uses  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4)  to  prioritize  its \nmaintenance program. \n \n12.  While the institutional capacities of MOTC and ARD are improving over the years, they \nare still weak. The main gap is project management, evaluation and reporting. MOTC does not \nalways  have  enough  financial  resources  for  maintenance  and  operations.  Road  asset \nmanagement is below par, although improving. Besides organizational gaps, MOTC encounters \ndifficulties  to  retain  talented  staff,  especially  for  project  management.  With  the  planned \ninvestments of $1 billion over the medium term, the workload will be increasing and this implies \nhigher  investments  in  human  resources.  MOTC  needs  an  action  plan  to  train  more  road \nengineers, economists and other road sector professionals. An HDM-4 needs to be expanded to \nintroduce  fully  integrated  pavement  and  bridge  management  systems.  A  comprehensive \ntransport development strategy is in place, prepared with ADB assistance.3  This has paved the \nway for a policy framework, road map and investment program in Appendix 3. But the challenge \nis to raise finance and execute the investments. The strategy focuses first on the reconstruction \nof major road corridors, institutional effectiveness and people. Rural roads and improved urban \ntransport systems are also part of the strategy. \n \n \n \n13. \nRoad  maintenance  has  been  a  problem  for  most  of  the  past  decade,  inadequate \nfinancing being a key contributor to it. This has cut the quality and value of road assets. But the \nsituation is being reversed with a 25% annual increase in budgetary allocations for rehabilitation, \nrepairs  and  winter  maintenance.  The  allocation  is  now  equivalent  to  $66  million  a  year\u2014\n$5,600/km\u2014quite close to international standards. The challenge will be to maintain this level of \nfunding.  The  cost  of  overlay  programs  alone  ranges  from  $20  million  to  $46  million.  The \napplication of a \"user-pays\" approaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous \nroad  fund  are  being  considered  as  additional  measures  to  reinforce  maintenance.  The  road \nsector policy framework and road map calls for incorporating these measures.  \n \n14.  MOTC  adopted  a  3-year  maintenance  program  during  2006\u20132008.4 A  second  3-year \nperformance-based  maintenance  program  started  in  2008,  with  34  contracts  under  ARD's \nsupervision,  covering  2,892  km  of  routine  and  3,127  km  of  winter  maintenance.  MOTC  also \nintroduced  performance-based  routine  and  winter  maintenance  contracts  on  main  and \nsecondary  roads  in  2006.  Performance-based  contracts  allow  MOTC  and  ARD  to  reduce  the \nadministration  and  financial  burden  and  improve  road  conditions.  The  benefit  of  performance \n\nRoad Maintenance and Financing \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

Endorsement of 3-Year Development and Annual Work Plan for State Roads. Yerevan.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n5.  \n\nRoad Safety \n\ncontracts  is  visible  in  areas  where  MOTC-administered  roads  merge  with  city-administered \nroads,  as  the  latter  are  generally  in  worse  condition.  The  next  step  for  MOTC  is  to  extend \nperformance  contracts  to  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  works.  This  is  envisaged \nunder the sector policy framework. \n \n \n \n15. \nRoad  safety  in  Armenia  has  been  deteriorating  quite  fast.  The  number  of  accidents \nalmost doubled from 1,025 in 2003 to 1,943 in 2007, and fatalities rose from 252 to 371 during \nthe same period. The fatality rate of 10.6 per 10,000 vehicles is eight times higher than that in \nEuropean  countries.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  large  number  of  pedestrian  fatalities.  The \nNational  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC),  established  in  2005  as  a  nongovernment  organization, \nhas  been  sponsoring  a  number  of  campaigns,  including  Think  Before  You  Drive  in  2006,  and \ndrove the initiative for a mandatory seat belt law in 2007. Other activities to improve road safety \ninclude  (i)  permanent  stakeholder  working  groups  including  traffic  police  and  nongovernment \norganizations,  (ii)  school  visits  and  awareness  campaign  programs,  and  (iii)  road  safety \nprograms  to  identify  accident  black  spots.  Self-financing  of  traffic  police  has  led  to  an \nimprovement in enforcement, in particular concerning the wearing of seat belts and drink driving. \nHowever,  NRSC  notes  that  traffic  accident  rates  are  underreported.  For  instance,  accidents \ninvolving uninsured vehicles are not reported to police, and fatalities are reported within 7 days \nof an accident, compared with the international norm of reporting within 30 days. \n \n\n6. \n\nDesign, Construction, and Consulting Services \n\n \nRoad design, construction, and pricing standards for civil works are outdated and do not \n16. \ncomply  with  international  best  practice  and  standards.  Inherited  from  former  Soviet  Union \nstandards, these are not based on economic efficiency, and unit prices are derived from price \nschedules of the 1970s\u20131980s with almost no competition-driven costs.5 Geometric designs are \nbased  on  the  technical  classification  of  roads  (categories  I\u2013V)  without  due  regard  to  their \nfunctions.  Construction  specifications  are  not  benchmarked  or  adjusted  to  modern  road \nconstruction  equipment.  This  contributes  to  high  construction  costs.  Inefficient  and  outdated \nconstruction  equipment  employed  by  the  local  contractors  makes  them  uncompetitive  and \nunreliable.  Despite  being  built  up  with  external  aid,  the  construction  industry  remains \nfragmented  and  weak.  There  are  no  national  contractors  with  enough  resources  to  manage \nlarge  contracts.  International  contractors  have  not  worked  in  Armenia  and  alliances  with \ninternational groups have not been materialized. In addition, bitumen and prefabricated concrete \nelements  for  road  construction  are  usually  imported,  posing  additional  challenges  to  road \nconstruction.  However,  cement  for  construction  is  abundant  in  Armenia  and  even  exported \naround the region. \n \n\n7. \n\nGovernment Strategy, Policy, and Road Map \n\n \n17. \nFaced with competing transport routes across the Caucasus, the Government's strategy \nis  to  develop  transit  routes  that  provide  shorter  and  competitive  links  and  services  to  national \nand  international  operators.  The  proposed  corridor  is  part  of  this  strategy  (Appendix  3).  The \npolicy framework calls for improved road management, institutional effectiveness, outsourcing to \nthe  private  sector  and  greater  attention  to  maintenance.  The  investment  plan  comprises \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investment  components  and  is  phased.  The  physical  component \n\n                                                 \n5   Price  schedules  are  converted  to  current  prices  on  the  basis  of  the  arbitrary  conversion  factors  issued  by  the \n\nMinistry of Urban Development. The local contractors' prices are evaluated against these price schedules. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ntargets  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  major  highways,  lifeline  road  networks.  The  nonphysical \ncomponent targets institutional effectiveness, planning, project management, best practice and \nstandards related to construction, maintenance and operations, improved safety, and training. It \nalso  covers  monitoring,  reporting,  and  evaluation.  The  total  cost  of  the  investment  plan  is \nestimated  at  $1.45  billion  over  the  medium  term  (2010\u20132017).  International  financing \ninstitutions\u2014including  ADB,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  the  World  Bank\u2014have  been  requested  to  help \nfinance this investment plan. \n \n\n8. \n\nADB's Strategy and Sector Assistance \n\n \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Armenia6\n18. \ninfrastructure, regional cooperation and private sector development. \n \n19. \nADB assistance to Armenia has focused thus far on the rehabilitation of rural roads (two \nloans approved for $48 million since 2007). ADB is also financing water and sanitation services \nin  secondary  towns  (an  investment  being  executed  through  a  management  contract  with  an \ninternational  operator).  In  2009,  Armenia  benefited  from  a  crisis  support  facility  arranged  by \nADB on account of the sharp economic downturn following the global financial crisis. \n \n\n focuses  on  transport  and  urban \n\n9. \n\nLessons \n\n \n20. \nADB  experience  with  road  projects  in  Armenia  is  confined  to  the  rural  roads  program \napproved in 2007. Some issues arising from this operation suggest some lessons, including the \nneed  to  pay  more  attention  to  (i)  sound  cost  estimations  to  avoid  supplementary  financing \nrequests,  (ii)  realistic  procurement  schedules  backed  by  better  planning  and  advance  actions, \n(iii) more extensive stakeholder consultation for better social safeguard planning, (iv) adequate \nand timely government counterpart funding, and (v) improved project management.  Under the \nproposed MFF each tranche will be converted into a loan only when the executing agency has \nprepared  a  detailed  project  design  and  is  ready  for  bidding  and  contract  award.  This  will  be \ncomplemented  by  advance  actions  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  which  in  turn  implies \nadequate counterpart financing. A program management unit will be set up to strengthen project \nmanagement and execution scheduling, evaluation, results measurement, and reporting. \n  \n\n10. \n\nOther External Assistance \n\n \n21.  The road subsector has received $300 million in external assistance since 1995 mainly for \nrehabilitation  of  1,100  km  of  interstate  and  rural  roads.  Apart  from  ADB,  other  sources  of \nexternal assistance are the World Bank, the Lincy Foundation (funded by Armenia Diaspora in \nthe United States), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. External assistance helped with \nroads  and  \"soft\"  infrastructure,  including  management  and  planning  capacities  of  MOTC. \nExternal financiers are earmarking an additional $250 million for the sector during 2010\u20132012. \nThis  includes  $110  million  from  the  World  Bank,  $40  million\u2013$50  million  from  the  European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank, and $70 million \nfrom  JICA  (the  latter  directed  at  the  north\u2013south  road  corridor).  More  information  on  external \nassistance is given in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2007.

A preliminary road design for Tranche 1 \nProject has been completed and is summarized in Appendix 5. Tranche 1 Project is ready for \nbidding under advance contracting. \n \nTranche  2  project  may  include  (i)  upgrading  an  88-km  Ashtarak\u2013Gyumri  section  of  the \n25. \ncorridor, (ii) developing a cross-border agreement with Georgia, (iii) undertaking feasibility studies \nand completing the design of subsequent tranches, (iv) improving border infrastructure, systems \nand  procedures,  and  (v)  completing  the  implementation  of  institutional  effectiveness  reforms. \nSubsequent tranches under the MFF will complete the upgrading of remaining parts of the north\u2013\nsouth road corridor. All subprojects will be selected based on the criteria in Appendix 6. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nConcept  of  Transport  and  Economic  Corridors.  The  proposed  MFF  supports  the \nconcept  of  road  corridors,  not  just  national  road  sections.  The  idea  is  to  improve  national  and \nregional  connectivity  and  in  this  manner  expand  the  regional  cooperation  agenda.  Azerbaijan \nand  Georgia  are  already  following  this  approach.  The  proposed  MFF  brings  Armenia  into  the \nsame model. The investments will benefit all the countries in the region and ultimately connect \nthe  Caspian  Sea  to  the  Black  Sea.  The  Investment  Program  was  prepared  and  will  be \nimplemented  in  close  coordination  with  all  the  players  involved  in  subregional  roads  corridor \ndevelopment programs. It is also being coordinated with other development partners and linked \nto Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC). \n \n27. \nStrong  Cofinancing  Content.  ADB  has  been  working  with  agencies  on  the  definition, \nfinancing and implementation  of a regional  investment programs. CAREC is the reference point \nfor coordination, although at the subregional level. ADB intends to establish a formal mechanism \nto expand partnerships and cofinancing.    \n \nD. \n \n28. \nto $70 million (Table 2).

A framework financing agreement (FFA) has been negotiated and its signing \nby the Government is being delayed due to the need on the part of the Government to complete \nintergovernmental procedures and to obtain requisite signing authorizations. The FFA signing is \nexpected  before  the  Board  approval.  Financing  will  be  provided  in  tranches  through  individual \nloans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and ordinary capital resources (OCR) in accordance \nwith  relevant  ADB  policies  and  the  FFA  to  be  signed  between  ADB  and  Armenia,  subject  to \nmodifications that may be included under individual financing agreements. An OCR loan will have \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the related loan agreement. A loan from the Special Funds resources will \nhave  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  interest  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth  in  the  related  loan  agreement.  The  tentative  financing  plan  for  the  Investment  Program  is \nshown in Table 3. The financing plan for Tranche 1 Project is in Table 4.

While some multilateral development \npartners  may  provide  financing  for  some  parts  of  the  Investment  Program  in  parallel,  other \ndevelopment  partners  may  determine  to  complement  ADB's  financing,  after  the  Board's \napproval of the proposed MFF, through cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of \ncofinancing  to  be  provided  by  such  other  development  partners  and  administered  by  ADB  will \nbe within the total MFF amount. Such cofinancing may be provided as loans or grants, and may \ntake the form of parallel or joint cofinancing. ADB's administration of such cofinancing from time \nto  time  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  for  information  annually. 7 JICA  is  expected  to  extend \nfinancing towards the Investment Program. This cofinancing is part of an Accelerated Cofinancing \nScheme  agreed  with  ADB  in  2007.  The  cofinancing  will  be  made  on  a  joint  basis  and  will  be \nadministered by ADB. ADB has been requested to raise additional cofinancing for the Investment \nProgram.  \n \n\nTable 4: Financing Plan for Tranche 1 Project \n \n\nSource \nA.

Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. See paragraph 79. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n32.  MOTC will be the executing agency and will sign and act as an employer for contracts \nwith  consultants  and  contractors.  Implementation  and  monitoring  will  be  delegated  to  ARD, \nwhich  will  serve  as  the  implementing  agency.  A  facility  administration  memorandum  (FAM) \nsummarizes the list of executing tasks and their sequencing (Supplementary Appendix H). Key \nfunctions  assigned  to  ARD  include  (i)  screening  and  approving  individual  tranche  projects;  (ii) \nplanning  and  executing  procurement;  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  final  project  designs;  (iv) \nmanaging  contractors  and  supervising  consultants;  (v)  maintaining  financial  management \ncontrols,  including  project  accounts;  (vi)  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project  implementation \nperformance  and  results;  (vii)  dealing  with  all  warranties  and  representations  made  to  ADB, \nincluding full compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies and action plans; and \n(viii)  managing \ninstitutional  effectiveness  program.  ARD  will  set  up  a  program \nimplementation unit (PMU) structured to include technical, legal, financial, feasibility study and \nproject design, and procurement and project management teams. These teams will also engage \nthe  services  of  evaluation  and  safeguards  experts.  The  program  implementation  organization \nchart is in Appendix 8.   \n \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n33. \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years starting in 2009. Tranche 1 \nProject  is  expected  to  start  in  April  2010,  with  completion  by  December  2013.  The \nimplementation schedules for the Investment Program and Tranche 1 Project are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nARD  will  procure  works  and  goods  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n34. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procurement  plan  for  the \nfirst 18 months of the Tranche 1 Project is in Appendix 10. Civil works for Tranche 1 Project are \npackaged  into  one  contract  to  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Small \nworks costing less than $1 million, although not anticipated at this stage, will be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  which  will  be  conducted  according  to  the  Law  on \nProcurement of Armenia (dated 1 January 2005), subject to clarifications and modifications as \nagreed with ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n35. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  require  services  of  international  and  national  experts.  \nThese  services  will  involve  consulting  firms  and  individuals.  The  work  includes  design  and \nsupervision, safeguards, due diligence or feasibility studies for subsequent tranches, monitoring, \nevaluation  and  reporting,  and  assistance  with  procurement.  Experts  will  also  be  engaged  to \nwork on institutional effectiveness programs, including help with planning, project management, \nand training. MOTC will select firms according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  quality-\nbased  selection,  or  consultant  qualification  selection  method  depending  on  the  needs  of \nindividual project components and the agreed procurement plans. ADB and MOTC will perform \ndue diligence in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants before using any \nof the selection methods. \n \n36. \nTranche  1  Project  will  require  immediate  assistance.  This  includes  about  89  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  296  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  most \nimmediate  task  is  to  complete  the  final  design  (preliminary  design  already  done)  and  supervise \nthe construction of the agreed road sections. They will also prepare tranche 2 and 3 investments, \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nincluding completing design work. Another immediate task is to strengthen a road subsector plan \nand guide its implementation. ARD will engage 32 person-months of international and 45 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  for  this  work.  Terms  of  references  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes B, C, and D. The principal approach is to agree on the core team members and to \nleave contingency financing to secure the services of short-term experts, as and when required. \nThe detailed design work will require the services of a consulting firm to be selected on the basis \nof consultants' qualification selection. The scope of services is small and the Government wishes \nto expedite completion of designs for bidding the civil works. Other assignments will follow quality- \nand  cost-based  selection.  Full  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for  evaluating  proposals  for  the \nsupervision work, and simplified technical proposals will be used for the experts needed to work \non  the  road  subsector  plan.  It  is  envisaged  that  80:20  quality\u2013cost  ratio  will  be  used,  although \nother  weighting  system  may  be  considered,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  For  project \nmanagement and administration, ARD will recruit a team of individual consultants in accordance \nwith ADB's procedures for recruitment of individual consultants to work in the PMU. \n \n\n5. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Results \n\n \n37. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  against  a  set  of  indicators \nrelating to the impact, outcome, and outputs in the design and monitoring framework shown in \nAppendix 1. MOTC will provide detailed baseline indicators before start of civil works, and will \nadopt systematic data collection procedures for reporting on results. A team of experts located \nin the PMU will assist MOTC with this work. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n38. \nTo  facilitate  program  implementation,  the  Government  requested  ADB  approval  for \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing of works, goods, and consulting services eligible \nfor  financing  from  the  MFF  proceeds.  Advance  contracting  will  help  the  Government  start \nprocurement activities prior to the signing of legal agreements. The Government was informed \nthat,  in  order  for  expenses  incurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive \nfinancing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once a tranche becomes effective, up to \n20%  of  resources  from  such  tranche  financing  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible \nexpenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of the relevant \nlegal  agreement.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the \nprocedures,  documentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  such \nexpenses or the related project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n39. \nwith  the  Government.  The  Government  acknowledges  that,  consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to \nany project under the MFF. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  individual  tranche \nprojects. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  ARD  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  financed  under  the  MFF.  In  case  of  any  irregularities, \nADB reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate financing under the MFF. \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nThe  Government  agreed  to  take  additional  measures  to  tighten  and  supervise \n40. \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  These \nmeasures include (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial \nstatements;  (ii)  decisions  on  all  procurement-related  matters  by  the  PGC;  and  (iii)  timely \ndisclosure of information on selection of consultants and contractors through local newspapers. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  under  the  MFF  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \n41. \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), primarily utilizing direct payment \nprocedure. To facilitate cash flows and program implementation, the imprest account procedures \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook will be followed. ARD will open and manage an \nimprest account at a bank acceptable to ADB after the effectiveness of each individual tranche. \nThe imprest account will be exclusively used to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures under \nthe  concerned  tranche  and  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  total  advance  will  not  exceed  ADB\u2019s  estimated  share  of  eligible \nproject expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of \nthe  tranche  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures,  as  described  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  will  be  followed  to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate advances provided to the imprest account for any individual \npayment  transaction  of  $100,000  equivalent  or  less.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  monitor  the \nimprest account and review monthly reconciliation of the accounts. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n42. \nThe Government agreed to adhere to sound financial management requirements during \nimplementation of the Investment Program.  ARD will be responsible for financial management \nfunctions.  Financial  management  assessment  of  ARD  was  conducted  in  2007.  The  review  and \nupdate  of  this  assessment  in  2009  confirms  that  ARD's  financial  management  system  is \nsatisfactory as it has (i) extensive experience in external aid projects and associated risks are low, \n(ii)  an  adequate  accounting  system  supported  by  standardized  accounting  software,  (iii)  a \nsystematized bookkeeping and reporting system, and (iv) a consistent internal control system. \n \n43. \nARD  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  adequately  to  identify  (i)  the \ngoods and services financed from the MFF proceeds, (ii) the financing resources received, (iii) \nthe  project  expenses  incurred  on  the  components  of  each  project,  and  (iv)  the  use  of \ncounterpart funds.  ARD  will  engage  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit \nproject  accounts  including  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures \nannually.  ARD  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  annual  project  accounts  with  a \nseparate audit opinion on the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures, as \nwell  as  the  auditor\u2019s  report  in  English  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during \nimplementation.  ARD  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of  audited \nannual  project  accounts,  and  the  suspension  of  disbursements  of  ADB  loans  in  case  of \nnoncompliance with the requirement. \n \n44. \nARD  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  individual  tranche \nprojects,  which  will  include  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting \nperiod,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered, \nand (iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. ARD will prepare and submit to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  each  tranche,  and  a \nprogram completion report after the completion of all tranches under the Investment Program. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n10. \n\nReviews \n\n \n45. \nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the approval of each tranche, and \nat  least  three  review  missions  annually.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  of  the  Tranche  1  Project  in  2011  and  a  midterm  review  of  the  Investment \nProgram in 2014. The timing of midterm reviews of subsequent tranches will be agreed during \nthe appraisal of each tranche. The midterm reviews will assess whether attainment of program \nobjectives  are  still  likely.  The  work  will  focus  on  (i)  execution  milestones,  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, and financial aspects; \n(ii) whether covenants remain relevant or need to be reconsidered; (iii) validate the soundness \nof the program and/or tranche; and (iv) review, and if needed, revise the design and monitoring \nframework of the Investment Program. \n \n\n11. \n\nPreparation of Subsequent Tranche Projects \n\n \n46.  MOTC/ARD will prepare subsequent tranche projects to be financed under the MFF. This \nwork  will  include  technical,  commercial,  financial,  safeguards,  governance,  implementation  and \nother  due  diligence.  Future  tranches  will  also  require  final  designs  and  advance  actions  on \nprocurement.  MOTC/ARD  will  then  prepare  and  submit  a  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  to \nADB for approval with the project appraisal report and a summary of the design and procurement \nplan. The PFRs and the project appraisal report will be prepared in accordance with the criteria \nand  procedures  stated  in  Schedule  4  of  the  FFA,  and  other  related  requirements  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  ADB  will  undertake  due  diligence  on  these  submissions  in  accordance \nwith its operating policies and procedures, and approve PFRs when deemed ready. If required by \nADB, ARD will amend the PFRs and request the Government to resubmit it to ADB for approval. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n47. \nThe Investment Program will improve the north\u2013south road corridor and will benefit road \nusers,  road  construction  companies,  traders,  and  people.  The  direct  benefits  will  include  (i) \nlower road transport and maintenance costs, (ii) faster and more reliable road transport services, \n(iii) reduced traffic accidents, (iv) improved access to markets and social services, and (v) jobs \nand  income  created  during  implementation  (i.e.,  use  of  local  labor  and  construction  materials) \nand after completion (i.e., roadside business activities). The direct benefits will initially accrue to \nvehicle  owners  and  operators  and  road  construction  companies,  but  ultimately  be  shared  with \npassengers  and  freight  customers  through  reduced  bus  fares  and  freight  charges.  While \nArmenia  is  the  major  beneficiary,  other  countries  in  the  Caucasus  subregion  will  also  benefit \nfrom  efficient  movement  of  traffic  to  and  via  Armenia.  Indirect  benefits,  which  are  expected  to \nbecome  tangible  after  completion  of  the  Tranche  1  Project,  will  include  (i)  improved  road \nnetwork  management,  and  (ii)  increased  business  activities  and  jobs  that  have  forward  or \nbackward linkages to the north\u2013south road corridor development. \n \n48. \nThe Investment Program will contribute to poverty by stimulating economic development. In \nparticular,  it  will  increase  the  mobility  of  about  3  million  people  living  in  six  marzes  (provinces), \nwhere  the  north\u2013south  road  corridor  lies.  The  poverty  incidence  in  two  marzes  (25.5%  in  Ararat \nand  32.1%  in  Shirak)  exceeds  the  national  average  of  25.0%.  The  unemployment  rate  is  high \n(about 12%) in Shirak and Syunik marzes as compared with the national average of 6.2%. It will \nsignificantly  benefit  the  predominantly  rural  populations  in  Aragatsotn,  Ararat,  and  Vayots  Dzor \nmarzes, which are deprived of reliable access to health care services. The Investment Program will \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nEconomic Analysis \n\ngenerate an estimated 2,500\u20133,000 jobs during implementation, of which an estimated 45%\u201350% \nwill be sourced locally in the form of unskilled labor or related services to the construction sites. \n \n49. \nThe employment level among the households along the north\u2013south road corridor is 70%, \nof  which  around  30%  are  engaged  in  agriculture  activities  or  small  and  medium-size  agro-\nindustries  (including  cottage  industries).  Reduced  travel  time  and  better  transport  services  will \nhelp improve the lives of people\u2014especially women, the elderly, and children\u2014as improved road \ntransport  under  the  Investment  Program  will  increase  their  access  to  the  nearest  markets  and \nsocial service delivery institutions such as schools, hospitals, and clinics, and create employment \nopportunities. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n50. \nArmenia  has  many  historical  sites  that  date  back  to  the  4th  and  5th  centuries  and  are \nhome  to  Christian  shrines  and  places  of  religious  worship.  Jermuk  and  Tatev  are  the  two \ntourism hot spots along the north\u2013south road corridor which attract many tourists from around \nthe  world.  The  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  promote  tourism  activities  and  thus \nsocioeconomic development in the region. \n \nB. \n \n51. \nEconomic  analysis  of  all  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 8  The  economic \nanalysis  for  Tranche  1  Project  is  in  Appendix  12.  It  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and \nwithout-project  cases  and  covers  a  period  of  23  years  (2010\u20132032),  comprising  3  years  of \nconstruction  and  20  years  of  operation.  On  the  basis  of  projected  GDP  growth  and  the \nestimated  income  elasticity  of  demand  in  Armenia,  traffic  on  the  improved  Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak \nroad  is  projected  to  grow  by  8.3%  annually,  with  average  daily  traffic  increasing  from  about \n13,060 vehicles in 2012 to 65,605 vehicles in 2032. \n \nThe major benefits of Tranche 1 Project are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel \n52. \ntime. The upgraded road will have an average IRI value of 2.0 m/km, compared with the present \nIRI  value  of  5.4  m/km  in  2009.  Savings  on  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  were \ncalculated using the HDM-4 software. The economic analysis shows that Tranche 1 Project is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 16.8% and an \nestimated net present value of $12.4 million at a 12% discount rate. A sensitivity analysis of the \neconomic  viability  of  Tranche  1  Project  shows  that  the  EIRR  is  reduced  to  14.9%  when  the \ncapital cost is increased by 20%, and to 14.6% when road user benefits are reduced by 20%. In \nthe case of a simultaneous increase in cost of 20% and reduction in benefit of 20%, the EIRR is \nreduced to 12.9%. The switching values are 67% for cost increase, 40% for benefit reduction, \nand 25% for a combination of cost increase and benefit reduction. This proves the robustness of \nthe economic viability of the Tranche 1 Project. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n \n53. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  regulating  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities for the Investment Program in compliance with national laws and ADB's \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  has  been  prepared  and  was  approved  by  the \nGovernment  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  LARF  is  summarized  in  the  summary  social \nsafeguards  (Appendix  13).  The  resettlement  classification  of  the  Tranche  1  Project  is  C.  Civil \nworks will entail the improvement of an existing four-lane highway and will take place within the \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 1997.

No relocation of households or acquisition \nof  productive  land  is  expected.  Borrow  pits  or  quarries  are  also  available  in  the  state-owned \nempty land, within easy access and away from residential areas. \n \nIn  Armenia  there  are  no  groups  with  characteristics  fitting  the  definition  of  indigenous \n54. \npeople  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Therefore,  the  entire  Investment \nProgram and all tranche projects will be categorized as C for impact on indigenous people. \n \nInformation  and  periodic  seminars  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  be  made  available \n55.  \nthrough  the  construction  company  to  people  associated  with  the  Investment  Program  and \nresidents  in  the  program  area.  These  outreach  activities  will  be  designed  by  the  construction \ncompany  and  submitted  to  MOTC  for  approval  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  management \npart  of  the  quality  assurance  and/or  quality  control  plan.  ADB  will  review  and  make \nrecommendations,  if  necessary.  The  preparation  and  execution  of  this  plan  will  be  an  integral \npart of the construction contract. \n \nD. \n \n56. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  covering  environment \nsafeguard  tasks  for  the  Investment  Program  in  compliance  with  national  laws  and  ADB's \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  has  been  prepared  and  was  approved  by  the  Government \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The  environmental  classification  for  the  Tranche  1  Project  is \ncategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. It shows that the Tranche 1 Project road section would not have a \nsignificant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impact during or after construction. \nMOTC will require the contractor to refine and implement the environmental management plan \n(EMP) outlined in the IEE, and abide by the environmental laws and regulations of Armenia and \nADB's policies, procedures, and guidelines. A cumulative impact assessment is not required as it \nis unlikely that significant cumulative or induced impacts will occur as a result of the Investment \nProgram. However, tranche 2 and 3 projects will widen and upgrade the existing road sections \nand  this  may  impact  on  areas  of  environmental  or  archaeological  importance.  The  terms  of \nreferences  for  the  environmental  impact  assessment  for  tranche  2  and  3  projects  include \nprovisions to ensure that the scope covers associated impacts. \n \nE. \n \n57. \nThe  Investment  Program  was  designed  with  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  continued \nGovernment  commitment  to  the  concept  of  transport  and  economic  corridors;  (ii)  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  sector  strategy,  policy  framework  and  road  map;  (iii)  adequate  external \nfinancial  resources;  (iv)  adequate  road  maintenance;  (v)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds; \nand (vi) sound designs and civil works schedules and MOTC's efficient and diligent oversight of \nworks and contracts. \n \nRisks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  (i)  macroeconomic  instability  in  Armenia  and \n58. \nthe subregion due to the current global financial crisis, (ii) reduced commitment to corridors and \nweak  implementation  capacity,  and  (iii)  cost  overruns  due  to  sharp  escalation  of  prices.  The \nGovernment  is  committed  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The  recent  macroeconomic  imbalances  are \nbeing corrected with help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other partners such \nas ADB and the World Bank. After the global financial crisis in 2008, the foreign debt of Armenia \nis being closely monitored by external aid agencies, especially the IMF. The latter expects that \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nArmenia\u2019s debt ratios will rise sharply\u2014albeit from a low base\u2014with the ratio of public debt \nto GDP increasing from 18% in 2008 to 43% in 2010. However, the debt\u2013GDP level is not \nprojected  to  be  excessive.  Standard  stress  tests  show  that  Armenia  is  at  low  risk  of  debt \ndistress. Economic conditions are expected to improve by the end of 2010. \n \n59. \nThe  investment  plan  and  the  financing  plan  for  the  Tranche  1  Project  include  large \ncontingencies. This will help tackle possible cost overruns and/or changes to the program and \nTranche 1 Project scope.

The country is \n1. \nreasonably  well-connected  with  a  coverage  ratio  of  about  280  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  per \n1,000 square km (km2). The network is 7,704 km long (1,686 km of interstate roads, 4,056 km of \nrepublic roads, and 1,962 km of local roads). Some 2,224 km of local roads were redesignated \nas  republic  roads  in  2008  with  2,500  km  remaining  undesignated.

The  interstate  network  is \nfully paved, and about 90% of republic roads (prior to 2008 additions) are paved. It is estimated \nthat 15% of interstate and republic roads are in good condition, 75% in fair condition, and 10% \nin  poor  condition.  Local  roads  and  many  roads  redesignated  as  republic  roads  in  2008  are  in \npoor  condition.  Road  conditions  vary  among  marzes,  ranging  from  only  10%  being  in  good \ncondition  in  some  (Tavush)  to  90%  in  others  (Ararat  and  Vayots  Dzor).  The  average \ninternational roughness index (IRI) value for interstate roads is about 5.0. Lack of quality control \nduring  construction  and  ineffective  maintenance  since  independence  has  resulted  in  rapid \ndeterioration  of  pavements,  prompting  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  External \nassistance  has  helped  Armenia  rehabilitate  interstate  and  local  roads  since  1995,  but \npavements \ninvestments, \nthat  were  not  rehabilitated  require  reconstruction.  Substantial \nestimated  at  $1.5  billion\u2013$2.0  billion,  will  be  required  to  improve  the  road  network  to  an \nacceptable level. \n  \n3. \nInternational  road  corridors  in  Armenia  are  standards  and  do  not  comply  with  the \nrequirements  of  international  agreements  and  conventions.  For  instance,  Armenia  is  a \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nRoad Subsector Management \n\ncontracting party to the European Union (EU) Agreement on Traffic Arteries1 that includes two \nroads  in  Armenia  classified  as  \"the  international  E-road  network.\"  These  are  routes  E117  and \nE691 that form the north\u2013south road corridor. The agreement stipulates conditions to which the \nselected  roads  should  conform  in  terms  of  classification,  geometric  standards,  road  safety \nequipment, environment and landscaping, and maintenance. \n \nB. \n \nRoad  sector  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \n4. \nCommunication  (MOTC).  The  work  covers  strategy,  policy,  planning,  investment,  regulation, \nasset management, evaluation and results reporting. The Armenia Roads Directorate (ARD), a \nnoncommercial state organization, assists MOTC in managing the network, including designing \nand  implementing  projects  financed  by  external  aid  agencies.  In  the  case  of  government-\nfinanced  road  works,  which  are  limited  to  rural  and  local  roads,  ARD  is  responsible  for  the \nfeasibility  studies  and  management  of  the  construction  and  periodic  maintenance  works \noutsourced to private firms through competitive bidding. ARD also conducts safety audits, and \nmonitors  environmental  and  social  compliance  requirements.  ARD  maintains  a  road  inventory \nand traffic database and uses the Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-4) to prioritize \nits maintenance program. \n \nWhile the institutional capacities of MOTC and ARD are improving over the years, they \n5. \nare  still  weak.  The  main  gap  is  project  management,  evaluation  and  reporting.  The  ministry \ndoes not always have enough financial resources for maintenance and operations. Road asset \nmanagement  is  below  par,  although  improving.  Besides  organizational  gaps,  the  ministry \nencounters  difficulties  to  retain  talented  staff,  especially  for  project  management.  With  the \nplanned investments of $1 billion over the medium term, the workload will be increasing and this \nimplies higher investments in human resources. The ministry needs an action plan to train more \nroad  engineers,  economists  and  other  road  sector  professionals.  An  HDM-4  needs  to  be \nexpanded  to  introduce  fully  integrated  pavement  and  bridge  management  systems.  A \ncomprehensive  transport  development  strategy  is  in  place,  prepared  with  ADB  assistance.2  \nThis  has  paved  the  way  for  a  policy  framework,  road  map  and  investment  program.  But  the \nchallenge  is  to  raise  finance  and  execute  the  investments.  The  strategy  focuses  first  on  the \nreconstruction  of  major  road  corridors,  institutional  effectiveness  and  people.  Rural  roads  and \nimproved urban transport systems are also part of the strategy. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nRoad  transport  is  largely  privatized  and  is  developing  rapidly  to  meet  the  demand  for \nhigher  service  quality.  There  has  been  significant  progress  in  private  sector  involvement  in \nurban  transport.  The  Government  has  removed  most  of  the  subsidies  to  public  transport \ncompanies and privatized bus and taxi companies. The number of bus and minibus routes and \nthe number of vehicles operating them are given in Table A2.2. \n \n\nRoad Transport \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   United Nations. 1975.

Trucks  entering \nfrom Georgia come primarily from the Russian Federation, other Commonwealth of Independent \nStates countries, Europe, and Turkey. The average number of trucks entering Armenia daily in \n2007 was 84 from Iran and 114 from Georgia. In 2008, an average of 59 trucks per day entered \nfrom Georgia as transit traffic\u201447% from the port of Poti, 6% from the port of Batumi, and 40% \nfrom Sarpi (Georgia\u2013Turkey border). By comparison, only eight loaded trucks per day transited \nfrom Armenia through Georgia. Turkish trucks on the Transports Internationaux Routiers system \nenter Armenia through Georgia. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe vehicle registrations show that cars constitute 80% of the fleet (Table A2.3).

This has cut the quality and value of road assets. But the \nsituation  is  being  reversed  with  a  25%  annual  increase  in  budgetary  allocations  for \nrehabilitation, repairs and winter maintenance. The allocation is now equivalent to $66 million a \nyear\u2014$5,600/km\u2014quite close to international standards. The challenge will be to maintain this \nlevel of funding. The cost of overlay programs alone ranges from $20 million to $46 million. The \napplication of a \"user-pays\" approaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous \nroad  fund  are  being  considered  as  additional  measures  to  reinforce  maintenance.  The  road \nsector  policy  framework  and  road  map  calls  for  incorporating  these  measures.  MOTC \nexpenditures on roads for 2006\u20132007, the budget allocation for 2008, and expenditure planned \nunder the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2009\u20132011 are given in Table A2.6.

MOTC also introduced performance-based maintenance contracts \non the main and secondary roads in 2006\u20132008. A second round of 3-year routine maintenance \ncontracts  started  in  2008,  with  34  contracts  under  ARD's  supervision.  These  cover  2,892  km, \nwith winter maintenance of 3,127 km. \n \n14. \nFunding  for  local  roads  was  transferred  to  the  responsibility  of  MOTC  under  the  10 \ndecree  on  10  January  2008.  Some  2,277  km  was  transferred  with  most  of  the  length \nredesignated  as  republic  road,  but  without  additional  budgetary  funding  for  maintenance  and \nupgrading. The 2007 budget allocated an average of $5,600/km for routine maintenance. About \n$12 million is needed for routine maintenance of the transferred roads. \n \n15. \nThe cost of an overlay program (30 millimeters [mm] to 50 mm) ranges from $20 million \nto $36 million a year, depending on its scope (Table A2.7). The funding of this program needs to \nbe  sought  with  consideration  given  to  introducing  a  road  fund.  For  a  sustainable,  transparent, \nand accountable road fund, management by an autonomous committee or board, consisting of \ngovernment representatives, road administration, road users, etc., is advisable. \n \n\nTable A2.7: Periodic Road Maintenance Program \n\nOption \n\nOverlay Length  \n(km over 10 years) \n\nCost/sq m \n($) \n\nAnnual Cost  \n($ million) \n\nI \n\nII \n\n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500) \n15% of Republic (4,056*0.15 =600) \n\n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500) \n30% of Republic (4,056*0.3=1,200) \n\n30 \n20 \n\n30 \n20 \n\n500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \n600,000m*7m*20/10= 8.4 \n\n500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \n1,200,000*7*20/10=16.8 \n\nIII \n\n30 \n20 \n20 \n\n500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \n1,200,000*7*20/10=16.8 \n600,000*6*20/10=7.2 \n\n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500) \n30% of Republic (4,056*0.3=1,200) \n30% of Local (1,962*0.3=600) \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n \n16. \nRecommended measures to improve road maintenance include (i) introducing a periodic \nroad  maintenance  program  and  allocating  sufficient  funds,  possibly  through  introducing  a \ndedicated road fund; (ii) implementing computerized road asset management and programming \ntools  built  on  databases  of  road  inventory,  condition,  contract  documents,  unit  prices  of  work \nitems,  and  available  funds;  (iii)  developing  road  maintenance  manuals;  (iv)  extending \nperformance-based road maintenance to fully cover the road network; and (v) controlling vehicle \noverloading. \n \nG. \n \n17. \nThe  road  safety  situation  in  Armenia  is  serious  and  deteriorating.  The  number  of \naccidents almost doubled from 1,025 in 2003 to 1,943 in 2007, and fatalities rose from 252 in \n2003 to 371 in 2007 (Table A2.8). The fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles is eight times as high as \nin European countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities. \n \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nItem \nNumber of accidents \nDeaths \nInjuries \n\nTable A2.8: Road Accidents, 2001\u20132007 \n2003\n1,025\n252\n1,294\nSource: 2007.

Other activities to address \nroad safety included (i) establishing permanent stakeholder working groups that included traffic \npolice  and  nongovernment  organizations,  (ii)  launching  school  visits  and  campaign  programs, \nand (iii) launching a road safety program to identify accident black spots. The NRSC notes that \ntraffic accident rates are underreported. For instance, accidents involving uninsured vehicles are \nnot reported to police, and fatalities are reported only within 7 days of an accident occurrence, \ncompared with the international norm of reporting within 30 days. Self-financing of traffic police \nhas  led  to  an  improvement  in  enforcement,  in  particular  concerning  wearing  of  seat  belts  and \ndrink driving. \n \nRoad safety workshops held in September\u2013October 2008 highlighted the need for a $10 \n19. \nmillion  program  for  2009\u20132013  targeting  a  10%  reduction  in  fatalities  (saving  around  50  lives \nannually). It also emphasized the need for a road safety board chaired by the prime minister to \nwhich a permanent secretariat would report. The secretariat (expected to be within ARD) would \nmonitor working groups for data management, safety engineering, and vulnerable road users. A \ndraft action plan was prepared that includes measures on seat belt enforcement ($2.0 million), \nspeed management ($2.0 million), drink driving ($2.0 million), and vulnerable road users ($1.5 \nmillion). \n \n20. \nSome  of  the  low-cost  road  safety  measures  can  be  implemented  on  a  priority  basis  (i) \nimproving  road  signage  and  marking,  (ii)  posting  and  enforcing  reasonable  speed  limits,  (iii) \nupgrading U-turn facilities to make them safer and eliminate abusive use of the median strip on \ndual-carriageway roads, and (iv) improving some of the long uninterrupted descents. \n \nH. \n \nThe construction industry in Armenia is fragmented and weak, but is gradually building \n21. \ncapacity  through  donor-funded  roads  projects.  After  independence,  there  were  large  road \nconstruction  companies  that  were  well  equipped  with  plant  and  machinery.  The  plant  and \nequipment  is  on  average  20  years  old  and  operating  inefficiently.  The  limited  market  for  road \nconstruction works has discouraged contractors from investing in new equipment. Replacement \nof  plant  and  equipment  requires  contractors  to  borrow  money,  depreciate  the  new  fleet,  and \nadjust  their  unit  prices.  Hence,  there  are  no  national  contractors  who  have  the  resources  to \nmanage  large  contracts.  International  contractors  have  not  worked  in  Armenia  and  alliances \nwith  international  groups  have  not  been  tried.  In  addition,  bitumen  and  prefabricated  concrete \nelements  for  road  construction  are  imported,  posing  additional  challenges  to  the  road \nconstruction  industry.  Cement  for  construction,  however,  is  abundant  in  Armenia  and  is \nexported around the region. \n \n \n \n\nConstruction industry \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nDesign, Construction, and Pricing Standards \n\nI. \n \n22. \nRoad design, construction, and pricing standards for civil works are outdated and do not \ncomply  with  international  best  practice  and  standards.  Inherited  from  former  Soviet  Union \nstandards, these are not based on economic efficiency, and unit prices are derived from price \nschedules of the 1970s\u20131980s with almost no competition-driven costs.3 Geometric designs are \nbased  on  the  technical  classification  of  roads  (categories  I\u2013V)  without  due  regard  to  their \nfunctions.  Construction  specifications  are  not  benchmarked  or  adjusted  to  modern  road \nconstruction  equipment.  These  factors,  along  with  inefficient  and  outdated  construction \nequipment  employed  by  the  national  contractors  and  imported  construction  materials,  have \ncontributed to high construction costs. \n \nGeometric  highway  design  standards  are  given  in  Table  A2.9.

This  affected  the \n1. \nroads subsector, which experiences the pressure and constraints associated with moving from \ncentral  planning  to  market  orientation.  Within  this  context  the  subsector  faces  development \nchallenges, both physical and nonphysical. The physical challenges are (i) the degraded state \nand substandard technical condition of the road network, especially subregional corridors; and \n(ii)  underused  and  dilapidated  infrastructure  at  the  international  borders.  The  nonphysical \nchallenges  are  (i)  limited  institutional  capacity  to  deliver  the  roads  development  program,  (ii) \ninsufficient road maintenance funding, (iii) lack of human resources and action plan to develop \nsuch  resources,  (iv)  a  weak  construction  industry  and  outdated  design  and  construction \nstandards, and (v) a deteriorating road safety record. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n2. \nThe  road  network  is  deteriorated  and  extremely  variable  in  quality.  Before  2003, \ninvestment in roads and maintenance was negligible. It has increased somewhat since then, but \nsignificant parts of the road network remain in a poor state. In 2008, about 4% of the interstate \nroads and 30% of republic roads were reported to be in a poor state of repair.  \n \nThe  North\u2013South  Road  Corridor  Investment  Program  aims  to  promote  regional  trade \n3. \nthrough investment in road and border infrastructure, and this will require substantial investment. \nThe Government's medium-term investment plan up to 2017 is estimated at about $1.45 billion \n(Table A3.1).   \n \n\nPhysical Infrastructure \n\nStrategic Context \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nNonphysical Infrastructure \n\n \n4. \nInstitutional capacities of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and the \nArmenian  Roads  Directorate  (ARD)  are  gradually  increasing.  However,  there  are  institutional, \ntechnical,  financial,  and  operational  constraints  that  need  urgent  attention  and  action.  The \nconstraints are (i) inadequacy of financing for road maintenance and operations; (ii) absence of \nadequate  planning  and  human  resource  training  integrated  with  university  programs  and \ncurricula;  (iii)  lack  of  a  competitive  and  efficient  construction  industry;  (iv)  lack  of  competitive \nconsulting engineers; (v) inadequate and outdated design, construction, and pricing standards; \nand  (vi)  absence  of  road  asset  management  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  A  strategy  to  solve \nthese  issues  was  prepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  technical \nassistance. 1  The  Investment  Plan  will  help  implement  the  road  subsector  plan  under  the \nTransport Sector Strategy. \n \n5. \nShortage  of  financing  for  the  road  subsector  reduces  the  sustainability  of  the  assets \nbeing  rehabilitated  and/or  reconstructed.  The  cost  of  a  bitumen  overlay  program  ranges  from \n$20  million  to  $46  million.  This  program  is  heavily  underfunded  and  new  sources  of  funding \nneed to be found. Stable and secure funding is required, including application of a \"user-pays\" \napproaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous road fund. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Armenia for Transport Sector Development Strategy. Manila (TA 4973-ARM) \n(attached  to  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed \nLoan to Armenia for the Rural Road Sector Project. Manila [Loan 2351-ARM]). \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n6. \nMOTC  and  ARD  lack  adequate  management  and  technical  skills,  systems,  and \nprocedures. Retaining talented staff is a challenge and there are no programs that link industry \nwith  the  engineering  universities  to  supply  needed  human  resources  for  the  road  subsector. \nWith the planned investments of over $1 billion in the medium term, the workload will increase, \nparticularly as the entire road network undergoes improvement. This should prompt investments \nin  developing  human  resources  and  an  action  plan  to  train  road  engineers,  economists,  and \nother related professionals to international standards. \n \n7. \nThe  construction  industry  in  Armenia  is  fragmented  and  weak  but  gradually  is  building \ncapacity through donor-funded roads and highways programs. However, there are no national \ncontractors with  the  resources  to  undertake  large  contracts.  International  contractors  have  not \nworked in Armenia and alliances with international groups have not been tried. The contractors' \nequipment and technologies are outdated and inefficient. In addition, bitumen and prefabricated \nconcrete elements for road construction are imported, posing additional challenges to the road \nconstruction  industry.  Cement  for  construction,  however,  is  abundant  in  Armenia  and  is \nexported around the region. \n \n8. \nDesign, construction, and pricing standards for civil works in Armenia are outdated and \ndo  not  comply  with  international  best  practices  and  standards.  Inherited  from  former  Soviet \nUnion  standards,  they  are  not  based  on  economy  and  efficiency,  and  unit  prices  are  derived \nfrom  price  schedules  of  the  1970s\u20131980s  with  no  competition-driven  costs.  The  geometric \ndesigns are based on the technical classification of roads (categories I\u2013V) without due regard to \nfunction  (trunk  road  or  rural  road),  and  construction  specifications  are  not  adjusted  to  modern \nroad  construction  equipment.  All  of  these  factors,  together  with  inefficient  and  outdated \nconstruction equipment employed by local contractors, contribute to high construction costs. \n \n9. \nRoad  asset  management  needs  to  be  introduced  to  capitalize  on  the  intensifying  road \nimprovement  program  in  Armenia.  ARD  maintains  a  road  inventory  and  traffic  database.  The \nHighway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4)  is  used  to  prioritize  the  maintenance \nprogram.  This  platform  will  need  to  be  expanded  to  introduce  fully  integrated  pavement  and \nbridge management systems. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe Government's short- to medium-term policy priorities in the road subsector are to (i) \ndefine  and  implement  a  roads  development  strategy;  (ii)  mobilize  needed  financial,  technical, \nand  human  resources  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  strategy;  (iii)  strengthen  policy \nmaking  and  planning  roles  of  institutions;  (iv)  develop  capacities  of  road  subsector  institutions \nfor efficient road management; (v) improve the worsening road safety situation; (vi) establish a \nlegal and regulatory framework for the private sector to participate in road network development, \nfinancing, maintenance, and operation, and (vii) introduce revenue generating mechanisms. The \nsector road map was developed in line with this policy framework. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nA medium-term road subsector investment plan for 2010\u20132017 was prepared based on \nthe Armenia Transport Sector Development Strategy 2020. Priority investments were identified \nto improve the interstate and rural road network during 2010\u20132017 at an estimated cost of $1.45 \nbillion.  The  investment  components  of  the  plan  will  construct,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate \napproximately 1,460 kilometers (km) of roads, comprising 620 km of subregional road corridors \n\nInvestment Plan and Sector Road Map \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\nand  840  km  of  rural  roads.  The  noninvestment  component  will  focus  on  priority  reforms, \nincluding the development of regulations and operational procedures; encouragement of private \nsector  participation  in  construction  and  maintenance;  and  capacity  building  for  planning, \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting.  Most  of  this  will  be  financed  from  external  aid  agencies \nalong  with  Government  budgets.  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  the  north\u2013south  road \ncorridor  and  help  the  Government  implement  the  road  subsector  plan.  The  Government  is \nseeking other external assistance to implement its investment plan, with the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and World Bank as the main sources.

The Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra route (M1 and M2 roads), crossing \nArmenia  from  south  to  north,  is  further  connected  to  the  east\u2013west  highway  of  Georgia  that \nleads  to  Poti  and  Batumi  on  the  Black  Sea.  It  is  part  of  the  Asian  Highway  (AH  82)  and  the \n\"international E-road network\" designated as E117 and E691 roads. \n \n2. \nTranche 1 Project: Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak and Yerevan\u2013Ararat Road Improvement. The \nproposed Tranche 1 Project will reconstruct the existing 18.4 kilometer (km) o the existing dual-\ncarriageway  and  four-lane  road,  including  the  intersections  between  Yerevan  and  Ashtarak  to \ninternationally acceptable standards, and improve traffic safety measures between Yerevan and \nArarat  (about  38  km).  The  road  works  will  be  confined  to  the  existing  right-of-way  and  be \nconstructed in sections, one side of the four-lane carriageway at a time to enable continued use \nof  the  existing  road  during  construction.  There  will  be  no  changes  to  vertical  or  horizontal \nalignments. The works are comprised of: \n \nA. \n \n\nYerevan\u2013Ashtarak Road Improvement \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nreconstruct the road bed and pavement structure including surface pavement; \nreconstruct  the  road  shoulders  and  road  drainage  system,  including  cross \ndrainage and side ditches; \nimprove  traffic  safety  measures  including  traffic  signs,  direction  signs,  traffic \ndelineators, guardrails, traffic markings, waiting lanes, and interchanges; \ninstall speed warning and traffic monitoring equipment; \nimprove road lighting at key locations and major interchanges; \nrepair  road  structures  including  bridges,  overpasses,  underpasses,  and  cutting \nand/or embankment slopes; and \nlandscaping. \n\n(vii) \n \nYerevan-Ararat Road Safety Improvement  \n\nB. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimprove  traffic  safety  measures  including  traffic  signs,  direction  signs,  traffic \ndelineators, guardrails, traffic markings, and waiting lanes; and \ninstall speed warning and traffic monitoring equipment. \n\n \n3. \nExisting Project Road Conditions. The existing 18.4 km Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak road (Km \n11.8 to Km 30.2) is four-lane divided highway originally built in the 1970s with extensions in the \nmid-1980s;  partial  pavement  rehabilitation  was  done  between  1990  and  2004.  The  original \nconstruction  quality  was  substandard;  pavement  service  life  has  expired  and  the  surface  is \ndeteriorating rapidly. Hence, reconstruction of pavement layers and subgrade is needed to meet \nthe design and construction standards associated with international transit routes. The road is \nnot adequately drained; the shoulders in some parts are narrow and not properly paved. There \nare  15  existing  structures  that  provide  crossing  and/or  grade  separation  to  the  traffic, \npedestrians,  and  wildlife.  Some  substructures  have  been  exposed  without  proper  slope \nprotection, and some superstructure has been covered with inadequate pavement, which needs \nrehabilitation to ensure structural integrity.   \n \n4. \nThe  existing  38  km  Yerevan\u2013Ararat  road  (Km  9.6  to  Km  47.2)  is  four-lane  divided \nhighway  built  in  the  mid-1970s  and  rehabilitated  substantially  in  2002\u20132003.  It  is  in  relatively \ngood condition and the wide median allows for future expansion to six lanes.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nBoth  road  sections  are  located  in  arid  areas.  The  landscape  along  the  Yerevan\u2013\n5. \nAstharak road is gently rolling uplands, and is flat along the Yerevan\u2013Ararat road. There are no \nunique  areas,  no  protected  areas,  and  no  forests  or  ecological  reserves,  but  there  are  two \nknown  archeological  sites  along  the  Yerevan\u2013Astharak  road.  There  may  be  undiscovered \narchaeological remains or artifacts below ground.  \n \n6. \nThe  core  samples  taken  from  the  selected  locations  indicate  that  the  thickness  of  the \nexisting asphalt concrete varies between 10 centimeters (cm) and 18 cm built on 12\u201318 cm of \nbase and sub-base material. The subgrade material appears to be unsuitable soil, and includes \nboulders. Hence, findings of the preliminary design indicate that pavement layers and subgrade \nneed to be replaced with properly engineered materials. Detailed calculations will be carried out \nat the detailed design stage to design pavement type, layer thicknesses, and subgrade strength \nrequired to sustain the projected cumulative axle loads over the life of the pavement. \n \n7. \nGeometric Design Standards. The project road will be classified as a category 1 road. \nGeometric design parameters shown in Table A5 will be adopted for the detailed design. They \nfollow  the  Construction Norms  of  Republic  of  Armenia  IV11.05.02\u201499  with  some  adjustments \nmade to take into account the E-road standards (refer to United Nations document on European \nAgreement on Main International Traffic Arteries, 2008).1  \n \n\nTable A5: Adopted Geometric Design Standard \u2013 Category 1 \n\nNo.  Main Parameter \nUnit \n1.

The preliminary pavement design consists of 50 millimeters \n(mm) of fine-grained asphalt concrete as a surface course (wearing course), 70 mm of coarse-\ngrained asphalt concrete as a binder course, 80 mm of aggregate mix with bitumen and 350 mm \nof  crushed  stone  aggregate  as  a  base  course  (road  base),  and  150  mm  of  gravel-sand  as  a \nsub-base. Armenia has abundant deposits of cement for construction of cement concrete roads. \nHowever,  roads  have  traditionally  been  built  with  asphalt  concrete.  A  detailed  study  will  be \nundertaken during the detailed design by the international pavement specialist, and will include \n(i) a comparative analysis of asphalt concrete and cement concrete pavements to arrive at the \nbest  option,  (ii)  detailed  pavement  calculations  and  design  for  the  preferred  pavement  option, \nand (iii) detailed construction specifications for the preferred pavement option. The analysis of \nbest option will be based on projected cumulative equivalent standard axle loads, state-of-the-\nart  construction  standards  and  equipment  application,  the  availability  of  domestic  materials, \n\n                                                 \n1   http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/legalinst.html. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39\n\ndurability of the pavement, ease of maintenance, environmental concerns (comparing emissions \nproduced for production of materials and construction), risks associated with construction such \nas  expertise  and  quality  control,  construction  cost,  and  projected  total  cost  of  the  pavement \nthroughout its design life.   \n \n9. \nRoad  Safety  Improvement. Road safety provisions on both roads are inadequate and \ndo not comply with international standards. There are randomly located U-turn facilities; signage, \nroad markings, and lighting are absent or inadequate; there are insufficient crash barriers and \nmedian  separation  barriers;  and  traffic  flows  at  some  interchanges  are  unsafe.  The  median \nseparation  is  misused  by  local  traffic  and  this  poses  a  large  safety  hazard.  The  proposed \nimprovements are summarized in para. 2.   \n \n10.  Material,  Equipment,  and  Labor.  Construction  materials,  such  as  embankment  soil, \naggregate, gravel, and sand, are locally available. A detailed material source study and analysis \nwill  be  carried  out  during  the  detail  design  or  prior  to  the  construction  works.  Other  materials \nsuch  as  bitumen,  steel,  high-strength  cement,  mechanical/electrical  material  and  equipment, \nand  spare  parts  will  be  imported.  Dismantled  asphalt  pavement  materials  can  be  used  for  the \nroad bed or as recycled asphalt pavement material, if the material can be treated satisfactorily \nand the quality maintained successfully in the required tests prior to construction. Most skilled \nand all unskilled labor is available in Armenia for road construction. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR PROJECTS \n\n \n1. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will only finance projects and/or subprojects that (i) \nare part of the Investment Program and the Investment Plan 2009\u20132017 adopted by Armenia as \ndescribed  in  Schedule  1  of  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement  (FFA),  (ii)  adhere  to  the \nimplementation arrangements set forth in Schedule 3 of the FFA, (iii) fully comply with the social \ndimensions  and  safeguard  frameworks  in  Schedule  5  of  the  FFA,  and  (iv)  meet  the  eligibility \nrequirements set forth in this appendix. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nsubproject shall \n \n\nTo be financed under the multitranche financing facility (MFF), each proposed project or \n\nSelection Criteria \n\nconstruct,  upgrade,  or  rehabilitate  roads  of  high  development  priority,  assessed \nfrom their contribution to implementation of the Investment Plan 2009\u20132017 and \nto achieving the objectives of the road subsector road map; \n\nbe  in  line  with  the  approved  feasibility  assessment  meeting  the  engineering, \nfinancial, economic, environmental, and social requirements of Armenia and ADB; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nhave detailed engineering designs completed;  \n\n(iv) \n\nhave  been  allocated  counterpart  funding  sufficient  to  implement  the  project  or \nsubproject  as  scheduled  and  maintain  such  project/subproject  facilities  upon \ncompletion; and \n\n(v) \n\nhave been granted government approvals and endorsements. \n\nApproval Procedures \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nApproval  procedures  for  projects  proposed  for  financing  under  the  MFF  will  follow  the \nrequired Government review and approval processes as supplemented by the requirements of \nthe Armenian Roads Directorate (ARD) attached to Schedule 5 of this FFA. \n \n4. \ngovernment approvals will have been obtained as of the date of the FFA. \n \n5. \napproval procedures will be as follows: \n \n\nFor  all  projects  intended  for  financing  under  subsequent  tranches  of  the  MFF,  the \n\nFor  the  Tranche  1  Project  proposed  for  financing  under  the  MFF,  all  necessary \n\nARD will have all the engineering designs reviewed and finalized; \n\nARD will review the project proposals to confirm compliance with eligibility criteria \nand then submit those eligible projects or subproject proposals to the Ministry of \nTransport and Communication (MOTC) for endorsement. \n\nARD will prepare a periodic financing request (PFR) in a format agreed with ADB \nto  finance  specific  projects,  and  submit  it  to  the  Project  Governing  Council  for \nreview  and  approval.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Sustainable  Development  Program  of  the  Government,  which  was  approved  in  October  2008,  is  a  long  term \ndevelopment strategy. The program is Armenia\u2019s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II), which builds \non the considerable achievements of PRSP I, and has three key goals covering the period 2009\u20132021 (with specific \nmedium-term  targets  for  2009\u20132015):  (i)  reducing  poverty  and  eliminating  extreme  poverty,  (ii)  ensuring  human \ndevelopment, and (iii) deepening economic growth and accelerating the development of lagging regions. According to \nthe Sustainable Development Program, the development and increased efficiency of the transport system is viewed \nas an important prerequisite for ensuring high growth, increased access to and efficiency of social services, increased \nlabor force mobility, and elimination of regional disparities. That is why the Government made improving the existing \nregional road network a priority task, and it has developed an investment plan to improve the main road network. Its \nphysical  component  will  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  Armenia's  major  highways,  lifeline  road  network,  and  the  cross-\nborder infrastructure; the nonphysical component will facilitate implementation of the road sector development plan. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $1.45  billion  over  the  medium  term  (2010\u20132020). \nInternational  financing  institutions  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  other  bilateral  aid \nagencies will share these investment costs. \n \nThe Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra route (M1 and M2 roads) crossing Armenia from south to north is connected to \nthe east\u2013west highway of Georgia that leads to Poti and Batumi on the Black Sea. This route provides Armenia with \nthe shortest access to the seaports linked to the Russian Federation, Europe, and Turkey. Meanwhile in Georgia, the \neast\u2013west  highway  is  being  improved  as  the  Government\u2019s  top  priority,  and  Georgia  plans  to  improve  the  Bavra\u2013\nZhdanov\u2013Akhaltskha\u2013Batumi road as an alternative link to Black Sea ports from Tbilisi. This will enable cargoes from \nArmenia  to  be  transported  to  Black  Sea  ports  more  easily  via  a  shorter  route.  On  this  basis,  the  Government  has \nselected  the  north\u2013south  road  corridor  to  be  improved  under  the  Investment  Program  as  a  priority,  and  ADB  will \nsupport this program through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $500 million. The Government requested \nADB to extend technical assistance for preparing the North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program to be financed \nby a blending of ADB's Asian Development Fund and ordinary capital resources and implemented in phases in line \nwith the priorities that will be identified by the transport sector strategy currently under preparation. \n \nTranche  1  Project  of  the  Investment  Program  will  (i)  reconstruct  an  18.4-kilometer  (km),  four-lane  section  of  the \nYerevan\u2013Ashtarak road to international standards, and (ii) facilitate implementation of the road subsector plan under \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  human  development  Index  (computed  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  2006)  for  Armenia  is \n0.777,  which  gives  the  country  a  rank  of  83rd  out  of  179  countries.  It  is  better  placed  than  Georgia  (93rd)  and \nAzerbaijan  (97rd).  The  Human  Poverty  Index-1  value  was  4.5  %  for  Armenia  (2006)  and,  according  to  it,  Armenia \nranks  14th  among  135  developing  countries.  The  situation  with  human  poverty  is  better  than  in  the  neighboring \ncountries (the value for Georgia was 5.5% and for Azerbaijan 11.8%). \n \nArmenia\u2019s  rates  for  poverty  (25.0%  of  the  population)  and  extreme  poverty  (3.8%)  in  2007  declined  from  the  2004 \nrates  of  34.6%  for  poverty  and  6.4%  for  extreme  poverty.  Poverty  has  become  shallower  and  less  severe  as  the \npoverty  gap and the severity  of poverty have also declined  significantly. In 2007, the poverty gap  was estimated at \n4.9% (down from 7.4% in 2004), while the severity of poverty was estimated at 1.5% (down from 2.4% in 2004). The \ndeficit between the consumption of the poor and the poverty line (expressed as a percentage of the poverty line) fell \nfrom 21% in 2004 to 19%. During 2004\u20132007, income inequality slightly decreased. Inequality measured by the Gini \ncoefficient indicates that the population polarization in Armenia is deeper in income distribution than in consumption. \nIn 2007 the consumption inequality measured by the Gini coefficient increased by 0.028 compared with 2004 (0.288 \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nin  2007  compared  with  0.260  in  2004),  while  income  inequality  decreased  by  0.024  (0.371  in  2007  compared  with \n0.395 in 2004). \n \nPrudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  were  instrumental  in  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  contributing  to \npoverty reduction. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.1% per year on average during 2003\u20132007, and \ninflation  averaged  3.9%  during  the  same  period.  Social  expenditures  increased  to  4.7%  of  GDP,  well  above  the \nprojected  PRSP  I  goal  of  3.0%.  Increased  resources  to  the  social  sectors  improved  the  access  to  and  quality  of \ngeneral secondary education, and led to improvements in the use of and geographic access to basic health services, \nmost notably through the free provision of primary health care to the population. \n \nHowever, despite the fast poverty reduction (including very poor) in Armenia, the poverty level still significantly varies \namong  marzes  (provinces),  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  This  situation  is  mostly  a  result  of  the  existing \ndifferences of economic development, and the peculiarities of physical, geographical, and infrastructure development \nof  different  regions.  According  to  2005  and  2006  National  Statistical  Service  Household  Survey  data,  the  poverty \nincidence  is  higher  in  marzes  affected  by  the  earthquake  of  1988;  in  bordering  regions;  in  the  regions  with \nunfavorable conditions for agriculture, especially  with small share of irrigated agriculture land; and in marzes  with a \npredominantly urban population. The analysis of poverty incidence by gender during 1999\u20132007 shows that there are \nno significant gender disparities regarding poverty in the country.  \n \nAfter growing at an average rate of 13.5% in 2006\u20132007, the Armenian economy moderated with real GDP growth of \n6.8% in 2008. It declined by 9.7% in the first 4 months of 2009 and is expected to decelerate by around 9.5% in 2009. \nRemittances, which at $1.5 billion accounted for 13% of GDP in 2008, are projected to be around 30% less in 2009. \nThe  Armenian  dram  has  depreciated  by  25%  against  the  US  dollar,  which  is  significant  as  70%  of  the  economy  is \ndollarized. The Government faces a revenue shortfall of 22% and a financing gap of $460 million. The fiscal deficit is \nestimated  to  increase  from  AMD40  billion  (1.0%  of  GDP),  forecast  in  the  original  2009  budget,  to  6.5%  of  GDP. \nUnemployment has increased and is likely to further rise. According to the National Statistical Service of Armenia, in \n2009  unemployment  is  6.6%  (compared  with  8%  in  2007  and  6.2%  in  2008),  though  unofficial  estimates  suggest \nfigures closer to 20%\u201325%. The poverty and social analysis conducted for Tranche 1 Project will also be conducted \nfor future tranche(s) as required.   \n \n2. Design Features \n \nDesign  features  may  be  incorporated  to  preserve  and  enhance  local  access  along  the  four-lane  highway  for  local \nproduce vendors, such as creation of roadside markets, through local consultation, with full sanitary facilities on wide \npull-out  lanes.  Other  possible  design  features  with  poverty  reduction  potential  will  be  explored  during  the  planning \nand implementation of Tranche 1 Project and following tranches following recommendations in ADB\u2019s Technical Note \non  Social  Analysis \n(http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Transport-Projects-Social-\nAnalysis/Transport-Social-Analysis.pdf)  \n\nfor  Transport  Projects \n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social and poverty impact analysis of tranche 1 and 2 projects indicate that the poverty incidence in two marzes \nout of five (Ararat 25.5% and Shirak 32.1%) exceeded the national average of 25%. The unemployment rate is high in \nShirak  (11.8%)  and  Syunik  (11.8%)  marzes  compared  with  the  national  republic  average  of  6.2%.  While  the \nInvestment Program aims to facilitate regional trade and benefit major businesses and those involved in trade, it will \nalso  significantly  benefit  rural  communities,  especially  rural  poor.  This  is  important  taking  into  consideration  that  in \nthree marzes (Aragatsotn, Ararat, and Vayots Dzor) the population is predominantly rural. While the incidence of rural \npoverty declined by 19.7% between 2004 and 2007, the trend is still 1.6 times lower than that in the urban area. In \n2007, 25.5% of the rural population was poor compared to 25% of the population of Armenia and 24.7% in the urban \narea.  The  Investment  Program  will  increase  the  mobility  of  about  1  million  people  living  in  six  marzes,  where  the \nnorth\u2013south  corridor  lies.  In  terms  of  human  poverty  modified  index  of  2005,  an  unfavorable  situation  has  been \nrecorded  in  three  marzes\u2014Aragatsotn  (49.6%),  Ararat  (8.7%),  and  Shirak  34.8%,  compared  with  the  national \naverage  of  32.4%).  From  the  viewpoint  of  human  poverty  (as  against  income  poverty),  the  rural  population  is  most \nvulnerable.  The  marz-level  analysis  of  human  modified  index  components  shows  that  the  most  influential  factor  of \nhuman  poverty  in  Armenia  is  the  lack  of  access  to  health  care  services.  According  to  survey  data,  about  62%  of \nsurveyed households visited health care facilities in case of need. Those who did not visit health care facilities (about \n38%) cited high official and nonofficial payments for treatment as reasons for nonattendance. \n \nAlmost all marzes, except Ararat, are also in unfavorable situations in terms of social vulnerability index of 2005. In \nSyunik marz the social vulnerability index (37.5%) exceeds the national average (36.6%) and in Shirak it is equal to \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\nthe  national  average.  This  is  because  some  social  groups  are  heavily  represented  in  the  composition  of  marz \npopulation (lonely elderly, unemployed, elderly, and poverty family benefits receivers). \n \nThe majority of households in the program areas are engaged in agriculture activities or small and medium-size agro-\nindustries  (including  cottage  agro-industries).  According  to  the  same  socioeconomic  survey,  71.4%  of  household \nheads are employed, and about 30% of them are mainly  occupied in agriculture  activity. About 48%  of households \nrefer land as the main source of their food production, about 24% of households of which mentioned land as the main \nsource of their income; 50% of surveyed households use the road corridor every day and about 40% use it several \ntimes  a  month.  The  majority  of  respondents  think  that  improvement  of  the  road  will  have  a  positive  social  impact. \nAbout 57% of the respondents believe that, as a result of the improvements, the road will be safer. More than 30% or \nrespondents  think  that  it  will  also  have  a  positive  economic  impact.  Hence,  17.9%  of  respondents  think  that  it  will \npromote trade and 14.3% think that the Investment Program will create short-term job opportunities for the community \nmembers during the construction period. \n \nReduced travel time and more available transport services  will help improve the lives of people, especially  women, \nthe elderly, and children, as improved road transport under the Investment Program will increase their access to the \nnearest  markets  and  social  service  delivery  institutions  such  as  schools,  hospitals,  and  clinics,  and  create  job \nopportunities. The Investment Program will generate estimated 2,500\u20133,000 jobs during implementation, of which an \nestimated 45%\u201350% will be sourced locally in the form of unskilled labor or related services to the construction sites. \n \nLocal  community  members  have  some  concerns  about  construction  waste,  disturbance  of  land,  and  safety  of  their \nfamily members. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nConsultation  was  carried  out  with  all  the  stakeholders  during  the  program  preparation.  Consultations  were  held  at \nvarious  levels  such  as  the  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  (ARD),  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication \n(MOTC),  the  State  Committee  of  Real  Estate  Cadastre,  Municipality  of  Yerevan,  Real  World  Real  People  (a \nnongovernment  organization  providing  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  education  services),  and  local  communities  to  be \ndirectly affected by the Investment Program. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy recommends that (i) \nconsultation  on  safety,  social,  and  cultural  concerns  will  be  continued  throughout  the  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program;  (ii)  men  and  women  are  given  equal  employment  opportunities  directly,  or  indirectly,  arising \nfrom  the  Investment  Program  and  without  any  differentiation  of  wages  for  equal  work;  and  (iii)  mechanisms  for \nmaximizing local employment benefits will be included in the bidding documents. These activities will be carried out \nby the program management unit to be established within ARD, with social and resettlement specialists supported by \nthe supervision consultants. The specialists will organize public information meetings and workshops for stakeholders \nand affected persons, addressing the safety, social, and cultural issues and, in particular for involuntary resettlement. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  formulated  and  has  been  translated  into \nArmenian, which will be distributed to the program regions for review and endorsement. During the different stages of \nthe  Investment  Program  (planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring)  following  actions  will  be  undertaken:  (i) \ndistribution of public information brochures or booklets in Armenian, (ii) placement of copies of land acquisition and \nresettlement plans (LARP) in Armenian in the marzes and local government offices, and (iii) uploading of the LARPs \nonto ADB's website. Community  authorities  and  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  informed  about  all  aspects  of  the \nInvestment  Program,  and  their  assistance  will  be  solicited.  The  processes  and  mechanisms  ensuring  active \ninvolvement  of  all  stakeholders  and  affected  persons  will  be  detailed  in  the  LARPs  prepared  for  all  future  tranche \nprojects, including the date, list of participants, and minutes of consultation meetings and workshops. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation     \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nViews and concerns of all stakeholders will be taken into account through consultation meetings and workshops and \naddressed whenever feasible. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues. The Investment Program will have a positive impact on gender equality. The majority of women in \nthe program areas are engaged in agriculture activities or small and medium-sized agro-industries (including cottage \nagro-industries). Reduced travel time and more available transport services will help improve the lives of women and \nchildren, as improved road transport under the Investment Program will increase their access to the nearest markets \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nand social service delivery institutions such as schools, hospitals, and clinics, and create employment opportunities.

This is part of M1, the main gateway to Yerevan from the north. The road has never \nbeen  rehabilitated  and  is  in  poor  condition.  The  Project  will  reconstruct  the  carriageways  and \nprovide road furniture of appropriate standard. It will rationalize and improve U-turn facilities and \nupgrade the M1\u2013M3 intersection. The benefits considered for normal and generated traffic are (i) \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings  from  the  improvement  in  the  road  surface  quality  and  the \nprovision of paved shoulders, and (ii) time savings.  \n\n \n\nBasic Parameters \n\nB. \n \n2. \nanalysis are given in Table A12.1. \n \n\nThe  parameter  values  for  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4) \n\nTable A12.1: Typical Vehicle Base Data \n\nTrucks \n\nItem \n\nCar\n\nMinibus\n\nBus\n\n2-Axle \n\n3-Axle  >3-Axle\n\n80\n57\n2.7\n255\n11.0\n2.3\n0\n \n \n \n\n30 \n57 \n2.7 \n212 \n9.6 \n1.7 \n0 \n \n \n \n86 \n14 \n\n40\n57\n4.1\n144\n8.2\n1.3\n40\n2.50\n0,83\n75\n70\n8\n\n17\n74\n5.5\n51\n4.9\n0.0\n2.5\n2.50\n0.83\n75\n20\n10\n\n20 \n74 \n2.7 \n212 \n9.6 \n1.7 \n0 \n  \n  \n  \n30 \n12 \n\n16\nEconomic cost ($'000) \n74\nFuel cost (cent per liter) \n4.1\nOil cost ($ per liter) \n76\nTyre cost ($ per tyre) \n8.6\nMaintenance labor ($ per hour) \n1.0\nCrew wages ($ per hour) \n15\nNo. of passengers \n2.50\nPassenger work time ($ per hour) \n0.83\nNon-work time ($ per hour) \n75\nWork-related time (%) \n60\nAnnual utilization (km'000) \nVehicle life years \n7\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n \n3. \nGenerated  Traffic.  Combined  generated  and  induced  traffic  has  been  assumed  to  be \n10%  of  normal  traffic.  Generated  and  induced  benefits  are  evaluated  at  50%  of  normal  traffic \nbenefits\u2014equivalent  to  a  normal  traffic  increase  of  5%.  The  current  international  roughness \nindex (IRI) of the project road is 5.4. After improvement, the IRI will initially be reduced to 2.0. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nBase-Year Traffic Volume. Traffic counts were taken at three locations on the M1 and \nat  the  Armenia\u2013Georgia  border  crossing  of  Bagratashen  in  May\u2013July  2009  (Table  A12.2). \nBased  on  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  (ARD)  monthly  count  data  for  interstate  roads,  the \nvolume in May is typical of annual traffic volume and no seasonal adjustment factor has been \napplied.  The  volume  in  July  at  ARD's  automatic  counter  at  Km  20.7  (the  count  site)  is  on \naverage 19.7% above annual average daily traffic volume. The July count has been adjusted by \na factor of 0.835 to annual average daily traffic. \n\nTraffic Analysis \n\n86\n14\n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\n \n5. \nThe Project comprises three homogeneous sections for traffic volume: (i) from the start \nof  the  four-lane  road  at  Km  11.8  to  the  junction  for  Ashtarak  at  Km  23.2,  (ii)  from  Ashtarak \njunction to the M3 intersection at Km 25.2, and (iii) from the M3 intersection to the end of the \nfour-lane  section  at  Km  30.2.  Traffic  volume  on  section  (ii)  is  estimated  at  70.0%  of  that  on \nsection  (i),  and  the  volume  on  section  (iii)  is  estimated  at  43.0%  of  that  on  section  (i).  The \ndistance-weighted  average  volume  for  the  Project  is  81.3%  of  the  volume  on  the  counted \nsection  (i).  The  base-year  2009  traffic  volume  on  the  Project  after  seasonal  adjustment  and \nadjustment for homogeneous sections is 11,257 (16,582 multiplied by 0.835 multiplied by 0.813). \n \n6. \nThe Armenia\u2013Georgia border on the north\u2013south corridor at Bavra is unusable by heavy \nvehicles  due  to  the  deteriorated  state  of  the  road  in  Georgia  immediately  north  of  the  border. \nThis  road  is  under  reconstruction  and  vehicles  traveling  to  western  Georgia  and  Turkey  via \nBagratashan  will  be  divert  to  much  shorter  M1  route  via  Bavra  by  November  2010,  before \ncompletion  of  the  project.  Based  on  the  results  of  an  origin-and-destination  survey  at \nBagratashan, it is estimated that 56% of vehicles (423 vehicles) will divert. The base-year traffic \nvolume for the project road, including diversion, is 11,680 (Table 12.2). \n \n\nTable A12.2: Traffic Counts \n\n \nPick- \nup \n\n \n\nMini-\nbus \n\nTrucks \n3- \nAxle \n\n>3-\nAxle \n\n2- \nAxle \n\n24-hour count: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLocation \n\nCar \n\n \n\n \n\nM-1 Km 20.7 \n\n13,761 \n\nM-1 Km 30 \n\nM-1 Km 70 \n\nBagratashen \n\nComposition (%) \n\nM-1 Km 20.7 \n\nM-1 Km 30 \n\nM-1 Km 70 \n\nBagratashen \nWeighted \nAverage  \nKm 11.8\u2013Km 30.2 \n\n938 \n\n493 \n\n236 \n\n26 \n\n \n\n5.7 \n\n8.0 \n\n8.2 \n\n3.4 \n\n4,755 \n\n2,215 \n\n527 \n\n \n\n83.0 \n\n77.1 \n\n76.6 \n\n69.7 \n\n965 \n\n341 \n\n229 \n\n34 \n\n \n\n5.8 \n\n5.5 \n\n7.9 \n\n4.5 \n\n446 \n\n351 \n\n121 \n\n15 \n\n \n\n2.7 \n\n5.7 \n\n4.2 \n\n2.0 \n\n191 \n\n117 \n\n33 \n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.2 \n\n1.9 \n\n1.1 \n\n0.8 \n\n64 \n\n36 \n\n31 \n\n145 \n\n \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n1.1 \n\n19.2 \n\n6,165 \n\n2,891 \n\n756 \n\n \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nPCUs \n\n16,582 \n\n17,275 \n\nPeak Hr \n(% of \nAADT) \n\n \n\n8.1 \n\n7.8 \n\n8.3 \n\n7.4 \n\n6,749 \n\n3,161 \n\n1,004 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9,601 \n\n650 \n\n672 \n\n149 \n\n311 \n\n138 \n\n159 \n\n11,680 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.2 \n\n5.7 \n\n1.3 \n\n2.7 \n\n5.5 \n\n82.2 \n\n100.0 \n\nComposition %: \n \nAADT = annual average daily traffic, PCU = equivalent passenger car unit, M = motorway, km = kilometer. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n \nFuture  Traffic.  Traffic  growth  over  the  analysis  period  to  2032  is  based  on  projected \n7. \ngrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) and an estimate of demand elasticity. The International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) June 2009 forecast for Armenia\u2019s GDP is growth of 1.3% in 2010, 3.5% in \n2011, and 4.5% per annum in 2012\u20132014. A GDP growth rate of 6.0% has been assumed for \n2014\u20132020, and of 7.0% for 2020\u20132032. Little or no change in population is expected over the \nperiod.  The  average  elasticity  of  traffic  growth  to  GDP  is  taken  as  1.2.  The  forecast  traffic \nvolume with and without the Project is given in Table A12.3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBus \n\n217 \n\n72 \n\n26 \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.3 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.3: Traffic Forecast \n\n2025 \n36,660 \n33,330 \n\n2020 \n24,490 \n22,270 \n\n2015 \n17,110 \n15,550 \n\n2032 \n65,605 \n59,641 \n\n2012 \n13,060 \n13,060 \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\nSection \nWith Project \nWithout Project \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n \nD. \n \n8. \nEconomic  Costs.  The  economic  cost  of  the  Project  comprises  (i)  capital  investment, \nincluding  civil  works  and  physical  contingency,  environmental  mitigation,  and  consulting \nservices for construction supervision; and (ii) net road maintenance during the analysis period. \nAll cost elements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.97 is applied to nontradable items and labor. \nA  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7  is  used  to  estimate  the  economic  price  of  unskilled  labor, \nestimated to account for 5% of the construction cost. The periodic maintenance cost saving will \noccur with the project case, as a thicker overlay will be required in the without-project case to \nlower the high IRI. The total economic cost for improving the 18.4 km road is estimated at $29.6 \nmillion. The residual value was assumed 30% of the initial investment cost. \n \n9. \nEconomic Benefits. The major economic benefits of the Project are savings on vehicle \noperating  costs  and  travel  time  because  of  improved  road  conditions.  These  savings  were \ncalculated  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4)  model.  Travel  time \nsavings  for  passengers  were  calculated  at  $2.50  per  hour  for  work-related  trips\u2014the  average \nhourly wage rate plus an overhead factor of one-third. For non-business trips, one third of the \nvalue of the work time saved is used as a proxy for willingness to pay. The time saved for freight \nis estimated at $0.3 per ton per hour as defaulted in HDM-4. It is in line with a load of 2 tons with \na  value  of  $10,000  per  ton.  The  time  savings  for  freight  are,  however,  minor  as  freight  traffic \nconstitutes only 5% of forecast traffic. \n \n10. \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) and the economic net present value (at a discount rate of 12%) were calculated \nby comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios for a 20-year period of operation. In \nthe  without-project  case,  surface  condition  is  calculated  within  HDM-4  based  on  typical \nmaintenance of an interstate highway. With the Project, the improved road section will be of a \nquality appropriate for the north\u2013south corridor and for the main approach to Yerevan from the \nnorth, directly improving accessibility between the two largest cities of Yerevan and Gyumri, and \nbetween Armenia and the subregion. The Project will facilitate business and reduce the cost of \ndoing business. As rural roads are being improved under the ADB and other external assistance, \nthe  accessibility  of  rural  areas  to  international  markets  through  the  improved  north\u2013south \ncorridor will be improved, providing all-weather access, faster travel, lower operating costs, and \nexport of agro-based products.  \n \n11. \nThe cost and benefit streams over the analysis period are in Table A12.5. \n \n\nThe EIRR is estimated at 16.8% and the net present value at $12.4 million (Table A12.4). \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\n \n\n \n\nTable A12.4: Construction Cost and Economic Analysis Results \nEconomic \n \nCost \n($ million) \n29.6 \n\nLocation \nYerevan \u2013 Ashtarak \nAADT  =  annual  average  daily  traffic,  EIRR  =  economic  rate  of  return,  IRI  =  international  roughness  index,  km  = \nkilometer, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nNPV \n($ million)\n12.4 \n\n \nLength \n(km) \n18.4 \n\n \n2009 \nAADT \n11,680 \n\nEIRR \n16.8 \n\nIRI \n5.4 \n\n \n\n \nTable A12.5: Cost and Benefit Stream \n($ million) \n\nInitial\nInvestment\n\nCost\nPeriodic\u00a0Maintenance\nWithout\n\nWith\n\nVOC\nSaving\n\nBenefit\nTime\u00a0\nSaving\n\nTotal\nBenefit\n\nNet\nBenefit\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n8.87\n11.20\n5.91\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n(3.59)\n0.00\n0.00\n2.76\n0.00\n(3.59)\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n(0.83)\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n(3.59)\n(8.87)\n\n0.00\n3.59\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3.59\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3.59\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3.59\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3.59\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.76\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.76\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.00\n0.79\n0.94\n1.27\n1.62\n2.04\n2.54\n1.88\n2.39\n3.00\n3.62\n4.48\n3.15\n3.95\n4.92\n6.06\n7.41\n6.13\n7.67\n9.46\n11.68\n14.36\n17.52\n\n0.00\n0.40\n0.49\n0.08\n0.31\n0.60\n0.98\n0.29\n0.65\n1.10\n1.69\n2.44\n1.07\n1.79\n2.71\n3.87\n5.26\n2.63\n4.00\n5.77\n7.72\n10.46\n13.83\n\n0.00\n1.20\n1.43\n1.35\n1.93\n2.64\n3.51\n2.18\n3.04\n4.10\n5.31\n6.92\n4.23\n5.74\n7.63\n9.92\n12.68\n8.75\n11.67\n15.23\n19.40\n24.82\n31.35\n\n8.87\n14.79\n5.91\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n(8.87)\n\nYear\n\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n\nEIRR\n\nNPV\n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12. \nSensitivity  Analysis  and  Switching  Values.

The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be \nthe executing agency and the Armenian Roads Directorate (ARD) will be the implementing agency. \nThe Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance the Investment \nProgram through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) up to the equivalent of $500 million and to be \nimplemented in tranches. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  appraisal  includes  the  appraisal  of  Tranche  1  Project  that  will \n2. \nreconstruct an 18.4-kilometer (km), four-lane section of the Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak road and not entail \nland acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts.
