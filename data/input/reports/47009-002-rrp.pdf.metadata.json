The project will play a \ndemonstration role for  the  sector  and  provinces  in  creating  multilevel  technical  and  vocational \neducation (MLT) systems.2 \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nBaise municipality is in one of the 14 national poverty areas in the People\u2019s Republic of \n3. \nChina (PRC).3 The population of 4 million includes six main ethnic minority groups, which make \nup  86%  of  the  population.4 Baise  is  being  developed  by  the  government  as  a  new  economic \nbase in the GZAR, focused on expanding and moving to higher-value-chain production in four \npriority  industries:  (i)  aluminum  processing,  (ii)  agriculture,  (iii)  tourism,  and  (iv)  regional  trade \nand  logistics.  As  it  is  close  to  the  border  with  Viet  Nam,  the  municipality  is  well-placed  to \ndevelop as an important logistical link to countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nand  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  The  strategic  development  of  Baise  supports  the  national \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan  agenda  on  rebalancing  the  economy,  and  the  national  urbanization \nplan.5  \n \n4. \nIncreased  investment  in  Baise  has  led  to  year-on-year  growth  of  25.2%  but  future \neconomic  development  is  constrained  by  lack  of  a  skilled  workforce.  Baise  municipal \ngovernment (BMG) has calculated a shortage of more than 80,000 skilled workers, particularly \nin  the  rapidly  expanding  priority  industries,  many  of  which  are  employing  new  technologies.  A \nmajor issue for the BMG and Baise industries and services is the number of people who leave \nthe province to obtain low-skilled work in other provinces and cities.6 Baise has trouble attracting \nskilled  labor  because  of  the  salary  differential  and  comparatively  undeveloped  key  industries, \nand is therefore left with little choice other than to develop its local human resources. \n \nTo address the skilled labor shortage, Baise\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan includes a human \n5. \nresources development strategy, centered on creating an MLT system which will link academic \neducation  and  technical  and  vocational  education  (TVET)  to  help  create  higher-skilled \ngraduates. The government\u2019s  National  Plan for Medium  and  Long-term Education Reform  and \nDevelopment,  2010\u20132020  identified  TVET  as  a  critical  element  in  developing  a  high-skilled \nmultilevel workforce to meet the demands of industry and services in the country.7  The strategy \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Guangxi  Baise \n\nVocational Education Development Project (TA 8448-PRC, for $500,000, approved on 4 September 2013). \n\n3  Nine out of the 12 counties in Baise municipality are national poverty counties. \n4  The main ethnic minority groups are Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Yi, Gilao, and Hui. \n5  National People\u2019s Congress. 2011.

Beijing: Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nin Baise aligns with two national education reforms which are changing the shape of education \ninstitutions  and  rebalancing  the  roles  of  academic  and  vocational  education.  These  are  (i) \ndevelopment  of  MLT  systems,  which  create  links  between  education  levels,  promote  lifelong \nlearning,  and  provide  learning  pathways  and  career  development  for  students;  and  (ii) \ntransitioning some universities into TVET-applicable institutions, which promote cooperation and \ndevelopment  of  pathways  between  TVET,  higher  education,  adult  education  programs,  and \nindustry. \n \nDevelopment of MLT in Baise will help to address critical bottlenecks in the quality and \n6. \nsupply  of  human  resources  and  is  an  important  strategy  for  the  BMG  to  support  inclusive \ngrowth. MLT will build opportunities for rural and ethnic minority students to better access and \nprogress in education and enter into the rapidly changing economy. MLT in Baise will integrate \nthe  education  and  training  systems  to  create  pathways  for  initial  training  and  entry  to  and \nprogress within the workforce by linking the human resources and skills supply from universities, \nvocational  colleges,  secondary  vocational  schools  (SVSs),  and  short-term  migrant  courses. \nBaise University, with its current three-level programs (SVS, vocational college, and university), \nand its role as the only higher education facility in the municipality,8 is well-positioned to take the \nlead  in  developing  MLT  provision  locally  and  eventually  playing  a  demonstration  role  at \nprovincial  and  national  levels.  Baise  University  has  been  selected 9  to  be  one  of  19 \ndemonstration  universities  in  the  GZAR  to  transition  into  a  TVET-applicable  institution  with  a \nfocus on developing majors that link more closely to industry needs. \n \n7. \nImplementing  the  reforms  for  MLT  and  the  transition  of  Baise  University  from  an \nacademic to a TVET-applicable university will require significant capacity building; upgrades in \nindustry.  The \nTVET \nattractiveness  of  TVET  as  an  option  for  students  has  been  a  challenge  for  the  BMG  with  low \nstudent  engagement,  retention,  and  continuation  in  the  mid-level  technician  and  technologist \nlevels  (i.e.,  in  the  vocational  college  and  undergraduate  TVET-oriented  courses),  which  are \npriorities for industry. The need for courses to provide industry-related TVET skills requires that \ncurrent curricula, instruction, and assessment are competency based, and are more flexible and \nresponsive.  Most  staff  members  do  not  have  relevant  industry  experience  and  standards  to \napply in the classroom or workshop. Building better partnerships with industry, involving them in \ncurriculum  development  and  training,  will  ensure  relevance  of  the  TVET  programs  and \nemployability  of  students.  The  project  focus  on  improving  quality  in  curriculum  and  teacher \ntraining, and strengthening school\u2013industry partnerships, will address these issues.10 \n  \nSpecialized  facilities,  workshops,  and  learning  spaces  will  be  needed  to  support  the \n8. \nemphasis  on  science  and  technology  courses  and  a  competency-based  curriculum.  The  new \nBaise  University  campus  supported  by  the  project  will  accommodate  a  multilevel  system,  with \nteaching and learning spaces beyond what is currently available. The new campus facilities and \nequipment will allow the MLT system to function and be responsive to industry. Features, such \nas the low-carbon photovoltaic system and Green Sustainability Center11 will serve as models of \ngreen and sustainable development for other campuses across the PRC. \n \n\ninfrastructure,  equipment,  and  systems;  and \n\nthe  participation  of \n\n                                                \n8  Baise University receives students from the 22 SVSs in the municipality as well as from GZAR and other provinces. \n9  Baise University was selected by  the GZAR Education Bureau to participate in the  Ministry of Education national \n\nprogram.  \n\n10 The TVET Training Center under the project will disseminate good practices in curriculum, staff development, and \n\ncreation of industry partnerships with other TVET schools in the municipality and, eventually, regionally.  \n\n11 The  Green  Sustainability  Center  will  develop  green  campus  management  programs;  curricula  and  research  in \n\nenvironment sustainability-related areas and outreach to students, staff, and local communities.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nThe  plans  for  Baise  to  assume  a  regional  role  require  innovative  responses  from  the \n9. \neducation sector. Baise University is involved in several regional cooperation arrangements with \nother  universities  in  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  and  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \ncountries. The project will build on these initiatives by (i) training a leadership team to support \nregional  cooperation  planning  and  activities;  (ii)  developing  curriculum  for  majors,  such  as \nlogistics and tourism; and (iii)  conducting research on the impacts of regional cooperation and \nindustry expansion on human resources and skills needs in Baise. \n \nStrategic  fit.  Ensuring  that  graduates  are  prepared  for  the  workforce  with  relevant \n10. \nknowledge and skills is a major challenge for the PRC\u2019s structural reform of the economy. The \nproject  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2010\u20132015  which  promotes \ninclusive  growth,  and  environmentally  friendly  and  resource-efficient  urban  development; \ndeveloping  high-quality  human  resources;  and  accelerating  education  reform.  The  project  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  the  recommendations  from  the  midterm  review  of  Strategy \n2020 which emphasize promoting TVET to address the human resource agenda, the education \nsector strategic plan,12 and with ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015.13 \n \n11. \nIncorporation  of  lessons  learned.  Lessons  from  TVET  programs  in  the  PRC  and \nglobally  that  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design  include  (i)  involving  industries  in \ncurriculum development and training; (ii) developing competency-based curricula, teaching, and \nassessment  approaches;  (iii)  creating  learning  pathways;  (iv)  building  a  learning  culture  for \ninnovation  and  reform;  (v)  creating  an  industry  demand-led  system  through  the  use  of  labor \nmarket and student employment information; and (vi) establishing robust project monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  economic  development  and  industrial \ntransformation of Baise municipality. The outcome will be a high-quality, flexible, and responsive \nMLT system developed which meets industry needs.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  proposed  project  components  and  associated  outputs  are  as  follows:  Output  1: \nTVET  quality  improved  and  capacity  developed.  This  component  will  (i)  develop  an \nintegrated  MLT  system  that  provides  curricula  linking  vocational  secondary,  college,  and \nundergraduate  levels  of  TVET;  (ii)  implement  a  competency-based  approach  to  curricula, \ninstruction,  and  assessment  in  priority  areas  across  different  majors  and  course  levels;14 (iii) \nupgrade  teacher  skills  through  pre-service  and  in-service  professional  development;  (iv) \nupgrade assessment and quality assurance based on industry standards; (v) develop curriculum \nin  entrepreneurship  and  employability  skills;  and  (vi)  develop  a  TVET  teacher  training  center. \nThe  project  will  develop  curriculum  and  teaching materials  including  digital  content.

The  project \nwill  assist  Baise  University  to construct  phase  2  of  its  new  campus  at  Chengbi  in  the  north  of \nBaise.  Civil  works  involve  the  construction  of  site  work  and  site  utilities,  teaching,  and  living \nbuildings  and  facilities;  and  equipment  procurement  and  installation.  All  buildings,  with  a  total \nbuilding  area  of  160,693  square  meters,  will  be  designed  and  constructed  in  accordance  with \nrelevant  PRC  and  GZAR  design  standards  and  codes.  Campus  design  incorporates  slope \nstabilization  requirements,  fire  truck  routing,  and  emergency  evacuation  plans  (including \ntemporary  shelter,  emergency  evacuation  routes,  and  emergency  exits),  campus  traffic,  and \nparking  plans  promoting  pedestrian  and  bicycle  traffic.  Low-carbon  and  resource-efficient \ncampus  management  features  will  be  introduced,  including  a  photovoltaic  power  generation \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nto \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\ninternational  best  practices \n\nsystem,  high-efficiency  heat  pumps  for  air-conditioning  and  hot  water  systems,  and  on-site \nwastewater  treatment  and  water  reuse  for  campus  landscaping  (2,000  cubic  meter  per  day). \nThe  project  will  include  the  installation  of  teaching  and  training  equipment,  which  will  be \nprocured  using  a  special  fund  from  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  TVET  capacity  building \nin  MLT \nincorporate \ncomponents  have  been  designed \ncompetency-based curricula and teaching, and school\u2013industry partnerships. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  Developing  an  MLT  system  will  improve  the  competitiveness  of \nBaise industries and support inclusive growth. The direct economic benefits include an increase in \nthe  number  of  graduates  finding  employment  and  better  remuneration.  Indirect  benefits  include \nimproved responsiveness of TVET to industry needs and improved quality of TVET provision that \nwill filter to other schools in the municipality. The economic analysis confirmed economic viability \nof the project. The sector wage levels and demand in Baise were projected and applied for the \nproject  economic  benefit  quantification.  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  reveals  the  project\u2019s  overall \neconomic internal rate of return at 16.7%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12.0%,  and  the  overall  economic  net  present  value  at  CNY249.6  million.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates that the economic internal rate of return is robust against all negative impacts.18 \n \nFinancial sustainability. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during project \n22. \npreparation  based  on  fiscal  impact.  It  indicates  that  the  proposed  project  entails  manageable \nfiscal  risk  regarding  the  BMG\u2019s  ability  to  provide  counterpart  funds  for  capital  investment, \nfinance operation and maintenance cost, and service project debts. The total fiscal contributions \nto  the  project  will  be  0.13%\u20131.08%  of  the  BMG\u2019s  projected  fiscal  revenue  during  project \nimplementation,  and  at  most  0.65%  of  fiscal  revenue  for  debt  service  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  during  the  operation  period.  The  project  is  therefore  considered  both  financially \nsustainable and has controllable risks for the BMG.19 \n \nC. \n \n23. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessment.  The  project  will  be \nADB\u2019s  third  loan  to  the  BMG,  which  is  successfully  managing  other  projects.  The  financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity assessments conclude that, although Baise University \nhas financial management capacity and project management experience, it lacks experience in \nmanaging  ADB  projects,  and  thus  capacity  building  to  implement  the  project  in  line  with  ADB \npolicies and procedures is necessary. The GZAR Finance Department, which will operate and \nadminister the imprest account, has sufficient experience in administering  projects financed by \nmultilateral agencies including ADB. The financial management assessment concluded that the \noverall  risk rating is medium  and  recommends  capacity  development measures  to  ensure  that \nthe  PMO  and  the  implementing  agency  are  able  to  meet  the  project\u2019s  financial  management \nrequirements.  With  mitigation,  the  PMO  and  the  implementing  agency  will  have  adequate \ncapacity for financial management and procurement. A procurement agent will be hired as per \nnormal PRC procedures, and provision has been made for training and advice to the PMO and \nimplementing  agency  in  ADB  procedures,  including  procurement,  disbursement,  project \nmanagement, and accounting systems. The financial management assessment is documented \nin  the  full  project  financial  analysis.  A  summary  is  included  in  the  PAM  and  recommended \nimprovements  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  BMG,  the  PMO,  and \nimplementing  agency.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nA  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. Baise municipality is one of the 14 national intensively poverty stricken areas in the \nPRC.  Nine  of  its  12  counties  are  national  poverty  counties  and  two  are  regional  poverty \ncounties. The per capita disposable income of urban and rural households in Baise is lower than \nboth the provincial and national averages.20 The majority of students at Baise vocational school \n(93%) and Baise vocational college (BVC) (78%) are from rural areas in the municipality, while \nthe  majority  of  students  at  Baise  University  come  from  across  the  GZAR  but  are  also  largely \nrural (65%). Employment rates of graduates are 92.5% for Baise University and 93.7% for the \nBVC. Since 2012, SVS tuition has been free, and Baise University and BVC students receive a \nwide range of financial assistance from national, regional, and local sources.  \n \n25. \nGender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The poverty and \nsocial analysis revealed that 90% of the students at the Baise vocational school are female; at \nthe  BVC  the  figure  is  75%  and  at  Baise  University  55%.  There  are  high  levels  of  female \nenrollment  in  the  majors  of  preschool  education  and  tourism,  primarily  due  to  gender \nstereotyping  in  these  occupations  and  low  levels  in  the  priority  science,  technology,  and \nengineering majors. Given the potential that Baise municipality has to become an industrial hub, \nimprovement of TVET programs will have a substantial impact on creating economic pathways \nfor  women,  especially  those  from  rural  and  poor  areas.  The  social  and  gender  action  plan \nensures  social  inclusion  and  gender  mainstreaming  in  all  components  of  the  project.  Gender \nactions  and  targets  include  (i)  50%  female  participation  in  MLT  and  recruitment  outreach \nprograms;  (ii)  40%  female  teacher  participation  in  core  teacher  training;  (iii)  gender-sensitive \ncompetency-based curriculum development; (iv) the new campus to include separate male and \nfemale  dormitories  and  latrines,  and  improved  night  safety  measures; (v)  a  35% female target \nfor civil works operation positions; (vi) a gender recognition award for industry partners; (vii) that \nfemale  students  are  paired  with  mentors  for  career  guidance;  and  (viii)  the  introduction  of \nspecific measures for prevention and reporting of, and response to, sexual harassment. \n  \nE. \n \ninitial \n26. \nenvironmental  examination,  including  environmental  management  plan,  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed to affected people.21 \nEnvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction  of  campus  facilities,  including \ninadequate waste management, noise, fugitive dust, and construction site safety. These will be \nlocalized and short term, and are adequately addressed in the environmental management plan \nand  supported  by  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  activities  under  the \nproject.  Meaningful  consultation  with  potentially  affected  people  and  project  beneficiaries  was \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  by  the \ngrievance redress mechanism developed for the project, coordinated by the Baise PMO. \n\nis  classified  category  B  for  environment.

The project will support the \ndevelopment  of  a  low-carbon,  resource-efficient,  and  environmentally  sustainable  campus.  All \nbuildings  will  be  designed  in  compliance  with  green  and  energy-efficient  building  codes  and \nspecifications.22 A photovoltaic power generation system will be installed in the campus and is \nexpected to generate around 3.86 million kwh of electricity per year, or 15% of the total demand \nof  project  facilities.  High-efficiency  heat  pumps  will  be  installed  for  air-conditioning  (heating, \ncooling)  of  two  project  buildings,  and  to  supply  hot  water  for  the  student  dormitories.23 The \nproject  will  also  support  Baise  University  in  defining  a  campus  sustainability  strategy  and \nestablishing a Green Sustainability Center. The strategy will ensure a sustainable environmental \npath for  Baise  University  through  the  identification  of  priority  sustainability  programs  related  to \nresource-efficient  campus  management,  green  curriculum \nlow-carbon,  energy-  and \nthe \ndevelopment,  and  community  environment  awareness.  The  center  will  coordinate \nformulation and implementation of these programs.  \n \n28. \nResettlement. The involuntary resettlement category is C. The project activities will not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Resettlement  due  diligence  has  been  undertaken, \nyielding satisfactory results with no outstanding issues.  \n \n29. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  indigenous  peoples  category  is  B.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment  has  determined  that  no  project  activities  will  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples. \nEthnic  minority  students  and  staff  make  up  a  large  percentage  at  each  of  Baise  University\u2019s \ninstitutions.  Baise  municipality  and  its  ethnic  minority  communities  will  benefit  from  increased \nnumbers  of  trained  workers  for  its  industries  and  services.  As  per  para.  17  SR3  of  the  ADB \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  has  included  measures  in  the  overall  project \ndesign  in  lieu  of  preparing  a  separate  indigenous  peoples  plan.24 An  analysis  of  the  issues \nstemming  from  consultations  with  staff,  students,  and  other  stakeholders  (e.g.,  Baise  Ethnic \nMinority  Affairs  Bureau)  was  prepared  and  recommended  actions  integrated  into  the  project \ndesign.25 Measures  include  (i)  data  disaggregation  by  ethnicity  for  an  employment  information \nmanagement  system,  student  tracer  studies,  and  industry  survey  system;  (ii)  participation  of \nteachers from ethnic minorities in training programs; (iii) development of curricula incorporating \nethnic  minority  culture;  (iv)  incorporation  of  ethnic  minority  culture  in  regional  cooperation \nactivities;  (v)  provision  of  social  indicators,  including  ethnicity,  in  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  and  (vi)  inclusion  in  the  project  management  consultant  team  of  a  social \ndevelopment and gender specialist with expertise in ethnic minority issues. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk  \n\n                                                \n22 Including GB/T50378-2006 (Evaluation Standard for Green Buildings), GB 50176-1993 (Thermal Design Code for \nPublic  Buildings),  DB45/T392  (Energy  Conservation  Design  for  Public  Buildings),  GB  50011-2010  (Building \nSeismic  Design  Code),  GB  50016-2006  (Code  of  Design  on  Building  Fire  Protection  and  Prevention),  Building \nEnergy  Saving  Design  Standards  in  Guangxi  Zhuang  Minority  Autonomous  Region  (DB45/221-2007),  and  other \napplicable national design codes. \n\n23 The heat pumps are expected to reduce electricity consumption by 2.34 million kwh per year.  \n24  \u201cIf  Indigenous  Peoples  are  the  sole  or  the  overwhelming  majority  of  direct  project  beneficiaries,  and  when  only \npositive impacts are identified, the elements of an [indigenous peoples plan] could be included in the overall project \ndesign in lieu of preparing a separate [indigenous peoples plan].\u201d ADB. 2009.
