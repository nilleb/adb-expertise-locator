The  project  will  increase  energy  security  through  the  diversification  and \nexpansion of energy supply routes. It will improve power supply reliability in the country and, in \nparticular,  the  Namangan,  Fergana,  and  Andijon  provinces;  reduce  transmission  losses;  and \nimprove the operational efficiency of the power sector.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe establishment of a Central Asian transmission system started during the Soviet era \nin  the  1960s.  The  transmission  lines  connecting  the  power  plants  and  substations  feeding  the \nload centers are at 500 kilovolt (kV) and 220 kV levels. The transmission system was designed \nfollowing the technical and geographical requirements to benefit from the diversified energy and \nwater resources in Central Asia. Yet, the locations of the substations and the line routing did not \ntake into account the countries\u2019 borders, as these were considered not relevant at that time. \n \n4. \nThe power grid of Uzbekistan is a major component of the integrated and synchronized \nhigh-voltage power transmission network of the Central Asian power system. The Coordinating \nDispatch Center in Tashkent manages network operation and planning. Trading arrangements \nbetween the countries are constrained by aging infrastructure, as well as varied energy sector \ndevelopment priorities of each participating country after independence. The reliable and secure \noperation of the transmission network is a prerequisite for power trade to reduce the economic \ncost of electricity for Uzbekistan and its neighbors. \n \n5. \nA  poorly  designed  transmission  grid  and  associated  capacity  constraints  became  an \nacute  problem,  particularly  for  the  most  densely  populated  region  of  Uzbekistan,  Fergana \nValley. More than 8 million people and several large industries in the region are supplied from \nthe main Uzbek grid (400 megawatts [MW]), the Kyrgyz Republic (1,300 MW), and generation in \nFergana (100 MW). As demand increases, the underdeveloped local transmission grid impedes \nthe  reliable supply  of  power  to domestic  customers.  During the  3-month  summer  period,  peak \ndemand reaches  2,000 MW, creating  overload  in the  current  220 kV transmission  system  that \nleads  to  a  voltage  drop  of  185 kV.  This  results  in  a  responsive  action  by  Uzbekenergo: \ndisconnecting  customers  to  reduce  the  load  by  an  average  of  150  MW.  Registered  cases  of \nvoltage  drops  to  100  kV  have  resulted  in  the  disconnection  of  80%  of  customers  in  Fergana, \nfollowed by a cascading effect of disconnections even in Kazakhstan. Regular maintenance of \nthe  grid  is  also  impossible  without  disconnection  of  a  significant  number  of  customers. \nTherefore,  additional  transmission  capacity  is  urgently  needed  to  satisfy  current  and  future \npower  demand  and  to  undertake  proper  maintenance,  which  contributes  to  high  voltage  grid \nstability in Uzbekistan and its neighbors. \n \n6. \nFacing  the  challenges  in  energy  security,  deteriorating  infrastructure,  and  unreliable \npower supply, the Government of Uzbekistan has taken various initiatives. It approved a 5-year \nrolling investment plan amounting to $5 billion to rehabilitate and upgrade energy infrastructure. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA). ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Namangan 500 kV Power Transmission Project. Manila (TA 8067-\nUZB, for $0.85 million, approved on 3 April). \n\n\f2 \n\nIt  also  commenced  institutional  improvements  to  increase  the  transparency  and  operational \nefficiency  of  the  electricity  sector.  It  reorganized  and  reinforced  the  investment  unit  at  the \nvertically  integrated  state-owned  power  utility  company,  Uzbekenergo,  to  implement  new \ninvestment  projects  more  effectively.  Actions  have  been  taken  to  improve  the  financial \nperformance  of  the  company.  A  loss-reduction  program  was  initiated  by  adopting  advanced \nmeters  to  increase  collections  and  reduce  losses.  Cost  centers  for  generation,  transmission, \nand  distribution  have  been  split.  Each  unit  has  a  separate  accounting  department  and \nimplementation  of  international  financial  reporting  standards-based  financial  statements  to \nimprove  financial  management  is  ongoing.  Electricity  tariffs  have  been  gradually  increasing  to \nensure the cost recovery level is maintained. \n \n7. \nAlthough a number of institutional changes have been initiated, little attention has been \npaid  to  improvements  in  the  company\u2019s  core  operations.  There  is  substantial  room  for  cost \nsavings  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  system maintenance,  planning,  and budgeting;  and  this \ncould  be  achieved  using  external  expertise.  Since  the  investments  under  this  project  are \nfocused  on transmission,  Uzbekenergo has  requested  assistance  for  the  reorganization of  the \ntransmission  asset  management  department  to  improve  efficient  budget  provisioning  for \nmaintenance  and  optimize  scheduling.  The  transmission  system  planning  department  is  also \ninadequate to meet present sector needs. Lack of modern tools and skills makes it impossible to \nplan  an  optimal  system  and,  thus,  optimize  investments.  Both  departments  need  to  be \ntrained  personnel.  Further \nrestructured,  and  equipped  with  modern \ninstitutional and operational improvements in the generation and distribution subsectors will be \nimplemented under the relevant investment projects, which are in the pipeline. \n  \nIn  2012,  the  power  sector  regional  master  plan  was  prepared  under  Central  Asia \n8. \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC). 3  According  to  the  master  plan,  the  Namangan \nproject  is  a  least-cost  solution  to  bring  additional  power  to  Fergana  since  the  region  does  not \nhave  hydro  or  fossil  fuel  reserves  for  new  local  generation,  and  no  additional  power  import  is \navailable  from  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  solution  is  to  bring  more  power  from  Uzbekistan\u2019s \ncentral  grid  by  adding  transmission  capacity.  The  master  plan  identified  the  project  as  having \nprincipal importance for the reliability of the Central Asian transmission grid to support regional \npower trade. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  a  government  priority,  and  it  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) to provide financial support. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan,  2011\u201320134 and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.5 It  will  be  the  third  project  loan \nintervention in Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector, with focus on transmission. The first two loans were \nin the generation6 and distribution7 subsectors, and implementation is at the procurement stage. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact of the project will be improved reliability of power supply in Uzbekistan. The \noutcome  of  the  project  will  be  an  expanded  and  modernized  high  voltage  transmission  grid \nproviding adequate and reliable power supply to Fergana Valley. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010.

The equipment supply contracts are expected to be awarded in the second half of 2013. \nUzbekenergo  and  the  implementation  consultant  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation \nschedule during the preconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n20. \nADB conducted technical due diligence on the investment proposal and is satisfied with \nthe quality  of the  cost  estimates,  operating  cost structures,  appropriateness of the technology, \nand the execution plan. The readiness level is high and the technical solutions are assessed to \nbe more cost-effective than the alternatives. Uzbekenergo\u2019s operation and maintenance staff is \nfamiliar  with  the  proposed  design  concepts.  The  technical  proposals  do  not  represent  a  shift \nfrom existing practices. Uzbekenergo has sufficient technical capacity and experienced staff to \nundertake construction of this project.11 \n \n21. \nTransmission  system  planning  and  transmission  asset  management  systems  are  a \nstandard  power  utility  practice  based  on  proven technology  and considered  appropriate  in  this \ncase. These systems are a technological step change for the company. This will require training \nto be included in the terms of reference for consultants and contractors. This is routine practice \nfor a utility when first implementing similar systems. Investment sites were visited by consultants \nand  ADB  staff.  The  contracts  will  include  sufficient  spare  parts  and  quality  and  performance \nguarantees. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe economic viability is assessed for the overall project based on expected streams of \nbenefits  and  costs  resulting  from  the  construction,  installation,  and  operations  of  the  project \ncomponents  over  their  economic  lives.  The  project  is  economically  viable,  as  the  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  in  the  base  case  of  23.1%  exceeds  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital,  assumed  at  12.0%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn remains viable even in the case of increased capital expenditure and reduced benefits. \n \n23. \nThe financial internal rate of return of the project is 4.8%, which compares favorably with \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.8%, indicating expected financial viability for \nthe  project.  Financial  viability  was  gauged  by  comparing  the  costs  and  benefits  in  with-  and \nwithout-project investment scenarios. Quantified benefits include enhanced reliability, increased \nconsumption, and avoided system losses. The sensitivity analysis shows that project viability is \nrobust  to  capital  and  operational  expenditure  increases,  as  well  as  reductions  of  the  revenue \nstream earned by Uzbekenergo. \n \n24. \nfor  power  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  in  Uzbekistan.  It  was  established  in  August  2001  after  public \nsector  reorganization  and  is  the  legal  successor  of  the  former  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nElectrification. Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial performance has been strong since 2006. The company \nhas  been  profitable,  with  return  on  equity  maintained  at  above  10%.  The  low  rate  of  tariff \ncollection resulted in increased accounts receivable and payable in three years, but this is being \naddressed  by  (i)  introducing  an  advanced  electricity  metering  system  that  will  reduce \n                                                \n11 Since  2007,  Uzbekenergo  implemented  and  commissioned  three  similar  projects  of  which  two  were  financed  by \nmultilateral financial institutions and one financed by Uzbekenergo resources. In total, more than 580 km of 500 kV \ntransmission line was constructed and four 500 kV substations were constructed or reconstructed. \n\nis  a  100%  state-owned  holding  company \n\nUzbekenergo \n\n\fGovernance \n\ncommercial losses and uncollected tariffs (footnote 7), and (ii) seeking a court verdict to write off \nsome unrecoverable receivables. \n \n25. \nThe  projected  financial  sustainability  of  Uzbekenergo  for  2012\u20132022  incorporates  over \nannual  investment  of  $600  million  to  modernize  its  power  facilities,  which  need  capacity \nexpansion and replacement of old and inefficient assets. The financial plan, with a good mix of \ndebt and Uzbekenergo\u2019s internal sources, can be implemented without putting undue stress on \nUzbekenergo\u2019s future finances and creditworthiness, but the tariff should be adjusted to reflect \nthe cost of services and inflation. Since 2004, the nominal tariff for electricity has increased at a \nrate higher than 15% per year, or almost five times, from SUM20 per kilowatt-hour to SUM97.5 \nper  kilowatt-hour.  Continued  tariff  increases  above  the  inflation  rate  remain  important  for  the \npower utility to achieve a sustainable financial performance without subsidy. The government is \ncommitted to maintaining cost of service tariffs for electricity. \n \nC. \n \nThe  government  has  undertaken  a  series  of  measures  to  strengthen  its  national \n26. \ngovernance, including (i) legal reforms to improve the judiciary and courts; (ii) reforms to public \nsector management, especially public financial management and tax reforms; (iii) measures to \nmake  the  private  sector more  competitive;  and  (iv)  more  transparent  procurement  procedures. \nProgress has been made in public financial management, including the adoption of the Budget \nSystem  Law  and  Treasury  Law  approved  in  2007  and  the  public  expenditure  reform  process \ncovering 2007\u20132018. Uzbekistan acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption \nin July 2008. \n \n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  Uzbekenergo  found  that  it  has  a  basic \nfinancial and accounting policy that adopts accrual accounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and \nother  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  conventions  in  compliance  with  national \nstandards. Capacity development under the ongoing Talimarjan Power Project is strengthening \nUzbekenergo\u2019s \nfinancial  management  capacity  and  accounting  and  auditing  practices \n(footnote 6). \n \nTaking into account the relatively lengthy procurement process under the first two ADB \n28. \nloans, Uzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was reassessed. Although Uzbekenergo is gaining \nexperience \nImplementation  and \nAdministration  Seminar  was  conducted  to  increase  the  PMU\u2019s  procurement  capacity.  The \nseminar  was  tailor-made,  focusing  on  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  needs,  with  emphasis  on  ADB  policies \nand  procedures  on  consultant  recruitment  and  procurement  of  goods  and  works  that  are \nrelevant  for  the  project.  Smooth  project  implementation  requires  (i)  that  the  PMU  has  direct \naccess to Uzbekenergo\u2019s management for efficient decision making, (ii) staffing of the PMU with \ncompetent specialists, and (iii) an international consultant to assist in procurement and related \nactivities. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time \nto  time),  including  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents.  Initially,  an  international  consultant \nunder  ADB  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  will  help  Uzbekenergo  prepare  bidding \ndocuments, conduct bid evaluation, negotiate contracts, and recruit consultants. The consultant \nwill  also  provide  on-the-job  training.  Subsequently,  the  project  implementation  consultants  will \nprovide  support  to  the  PMU  in  procurement  management.  An  early  warning  system  will  be \nestablished to ensure timely procurement and project implementation.  \n  \n\nin  working  with  ADB,  an  additional  Special  Project \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe project will increase access to a more reliable form of electricity for people living in \nFergana  Valley.  The  region  will  become  a  better  place  that  provides  more  labor-based  wage \nemployment  opportunities,  as  industry  will  have  the  necessary  inducement  to  relocate  to  the \nFergana.  This  will  prevent  the  need  for  labor  to  move  elsewhere  to  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent  States  countries,  especially  the  Russian Federation,  in search of non-agriculture-\nbased  wage  labor  employment  opportunities.  Andijon,  with  9%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  population, \ncurrently  produces  21.5%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  non-agriculture-based  outputs,  but  Fergana  and \nNamangan are less industrialized and more rural. This has an obvious beneficial social impact \non such households because many adult income-earners, especially males, are not required to \nbe absent from households for an extended period of time. Such households are able to retain \nor  enhance  their  social  capital  in  ways  not  formerly  possible  where  adult  household  members \nare typically absent because of lack of local employment opportunities. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n \n31. \nEnvironmental  categorization  of  the  project  is  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared, and potential \naffected  people  were  consulted.  Uzbekenergo  cleared  the  IEE  report  and  it  was  disclosed  via \nADB\u2019s  website  on  1  August  2012.  The  transmission  lines  run  through  areas  with  low \nenvironmental sensitivities. No significant or irreversible impacts are expected with the operation \nof  the  new  lines.  There  will  be  some  temporary  impacts  during  the  construction  phase,  but \nmitigation measures have been developed. The environmental management plan has also been \nprepared  as  part  of  the  IEE  to  ensure  that  adequate  resources  are  allocated  to  handle  the \nimpact. Mitigation measures could be included as part of the construction costs. Implementation \nof the environmental management plan will be recorded and reported through a project quarterly \nreport,  and  a  stand-alone  environmental  monitoring  report  will  be  submitted  annually  to  ADB. \nPMU  staff  has  been  involved  in  similar  projects  financed  by  other  multilateral  financial \ninstitutions  and  they  have  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  the  environmental  safeguards. \nEnvironmental  specialists  of  the  implementation  consultants  will  provide  additional  support  to \nthe PMU. \n \n \n \n32. \nThe  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguard.  The  field  social  survey \nfound no ethnic minority, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009, involved or \naffected by the project. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement safeguard. A land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  the  transmission  lines  has  been  prepared  based \non  the  preliminary  design  of  the  project,  in  close  consultation  with  affected  households.  A \ndetailed socioeconomic survey was carried out. Uzbekenergo submitted the LARP to ADB and it \nwas  disclosed  via  ADB\u2019s  website  on  1  August  2012.  Uzbekenergo  will  update  the  LARP  after \nfinalizing the detailed design and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \n\nSocial Assessment \n\n2. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  will  permanently  acquire  21.9  hectares  (ha), 12  of  which  11.7  ha  is \n33. \ngovernment  unallocated  land.  About  346.2  ha  will  be  temporarily  acquired  for  use  during  the \nconstruction  period,  of  which  212.8  ha  is  government  unallocated  land.  Affected  households \ntotal 145, with 1,003 affected people. Seventeen affected households or 109 affected people will \nlose  shelter  and  be  relocated  as  much  as  possible  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  their  original \nhomes.  Almost  all  affected  households  will  be  affected  by  two  impacts\u2014land  and  crops;  only \none affected household will lose almost 10% of its productive land. The total compensation for \nland acquisition, temporary and permanent, will be about $2 million.  \n \n34.  Monitoring the implementation of LARP will be done on a quarterly basis and the report \nwill be submitted to ADB. The report will include the number of affected households who were \npaid  compensation,  monetary  value  of  paid  compensation,  and  location  where  compensation \nhas been completely executed and demolition of structures, if any. The report on completion of \nLARP  implementation,  especially  on  payment  of  compensation,  should  be  submitted  to  ADB \nprior to commencement of any field works for the transmission line. \n \nF. \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCivil works and hydro isolation for concrete structures in \nhigh mountain terrain \n\nTransportation of large and heavy equipment to the \nconstruction site  \n\nProcurement delays \n\nProject management  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nUse bitumen and specialized cloth wrap-up for concrete \nstructure hydro isolation. Conduct hydro isolation at the \nconstruction site and deliver the ready-to-install \nstructures to the stake point (picket). \nReach an agreement on the supply of large and heavy \nequipment via rail across the neighboring country up to \nNamangan railway station. \nAdvance contracting adopted.

This  will  later  be  used  for  Namangan  substation.  The  due \ndiligence for these 25 ha found that this land had been acquired from reserved local government land in 2011. No \nimpact related with acquisition of this land, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and no third party \nclaim are expected since the land was part of the government\u2019s reserved land. \n\n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThe government and Uzbekenergo have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \n\n37. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \n38. \nAs  a  condition  for  disbursement  after  the  proposed  ADB  loans  are  declared  effective, \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  for  the  relending  of  the  ADB  loans  to  Uzbekenergo,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been signed and become effective in accordance with \nthe terms. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n \n39. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR86,778,000  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Namangan  500-Kilovolt  Power  Transmission  Project,  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  loan  of  $18,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Namangan             \n500-Kilovolt  Power  Transmission  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n19 September 2012 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved reliability of \npower supply in \nUzbekistan \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n \nVoltage variation on \n220 kV grid reduced from \n16% in 2011 to 5% by \n2019 \n\nOutcome \nAn expanded and \nmodernized high-\nvoltage transmission \ngrid in Fergana Valley \n\n \nPower supply capacity to \nFergana Valley increased \nfrom 1,800 MW in 2011 to \n2,800 MW by 2017 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nUzbekenergo\u2019s audited \nannual financial \nstatements \n \nUzbekenergo\u2019s annual \nreport \n\n \nUzbekenergo\u2019s annual \nreport \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\nAssumption \nThe government policy \nwill continue to prioritize \nenergy security. \n\nAssumption \nUzbekenergo generates \nsufficient electricity to \nsupply Fergana Valley. \n\nLosses in high-voltage \ntransmission network \nreduced from 4.5% \n(200 GWh) in 2011 to \nbelow 2.5% (110 GWh) by \n2017 \n\n \n175 km of new 500 kV and \n32 km of 220 kV \ntransmission lines \nconstructed by 2017 \n\n \nCommissioning \ncertificate by \nUzbekenergo \n\nOutputs \n1.
