Poverty rates have declined in \nthe Philippines in the past two decades, but the absolute number of \npoor people has increased to over 26 million. The second quarter 2005 \nSocial Weather Survey reported that as many as 57% of household \nheads perceived their households to be poor. The critical fiscal situation \nthat emerged in 2002 has compressed public investment and funding \nfor the social sectors, which in turn has been a drag on achieving higher \neconomic growth and has hurt the poor. These problems have been \ncompounded by poor governance in public expenditure management, \ncorruption in procurement, and a weak investment climate.  \nReforms supporting fiscal consolidation, strengthening governance and \nreducing corruption in key government agencies, and improving the \ninvestment climate and infrastructure are crucially important to putting \neconomic growth on a more sustainable path, re-directing spending \ntoward the social sectors, and contributing to poverty reduction. These \nmeasures are taking place in the context of the government\u2019s adoption \nof  a  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework  (MTEF)  which  explicitly \nlinks the overarching objective of poverty reduction to fiscal discipline, \nstrategic  prioritization  in  the  allocation  of  resources,  and  effective \nimplementation of budgeted programs and projects.    \n \nThe Government has implemented a series of measures to address the \nfiscal imbalance, resulting in a swift and impressive turnaround in the \nfiscal  situation  and  improved  macroeconomic  stability  in  2006.  The \nDPSP cluster supports the Government\u2019s efforts to improve the fiscal \nsituation  and  to  broaden  the  reform  program  in  four  target  areas:  \n(i)  further  fiscal  consolidation,  macroeconomic  stability,  and  \n ", " ii \n \ncreditworthiness; (ii) deepening reforms in public financial management \nand anti-corruption; (iii) investment climate and infrastructure, and (iv) \nprotecting the social sectors.  The reform program was prepared by a \njoint team of representatives of the Government of the Philippines, the \nAsian Development Bank and the World Bank. \n   \nImpact and  The DPSP will support the Government\u2019s efforts to (i) achieve and \nOutcome  sustain  higher  economic  growth  and  (ii)  reduce  poverty  and \nunemployment.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  DPSP  cluster  will \nundertake strategic reforms to: \n \n(i)  restore fiscal sustainability, maintain macroeconomic stability, and \nimprove  creditworthiness  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal \nmanagement  through  raising  tax  revenues,  strengthening  tax \nadministration,  reducing  inefficient  spending,  and  strengthening \nthe debt management strategy; \n(ii)  enhance  governance  in  public  expenditure  management  and \nsupport the Government\u2019s measures to reduce corruption in the \nrevenue-collecting agencies of the Bureau of Internal Revenue \n(BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BOC);  \n(iii)  improve the investment climate by clarifying and strengthening the \nlegal and regulatory framework for investments and infrastructure; \nand  \n(iv)  protect the social sectors by improving the access to and quality of \nsocial services, and enhancing poverty monitoring and targeting. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility for subprogram 1 of the Development Policy Support \nProgram. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of \n3 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Program Loan Agreement.1 \n   \nPeriod and  The program cluster period will be from November 2004 to December \nTranching  2009, with a single tranche loan of $250 million to be disbursed under \nsubprogram  1  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for \neffectiveness. Subprogram 2 will be submitted for Board consideration \napproximately  12  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1, \nsubject  to  the  Government\u2019s  readiness  to  continue  with  its  reform \nagenda.  Subprogram  3  will  be  submitted  for  Board  consideration \napproximately  12  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  2, \nsubject  to  the  Government\u2019s  readiness  to  continue  with  its  reform \nagenda. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of social \nexpenditure. \n                                                 \n1 The World Bank is cofinancing the reform program through its Development Policy Loan ($250 million). \n ", "  iii \n   \nExecuting Agency   Department of Finance (DOF)  \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  will  be  the \nArrangements  Implementing Agency responsible for implementing the Program, and \nshall  be  supported  by  the  relevant  line  agencies  of  the  Borrower, \nincluding the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), Department of Public \nWorks  and  Highways  (DPWH),  Department  of  Health  (DOH), \nDepartment of Education (DepED), and Department of Agriculture (DA). \nA  DPSP  coordinating  committee  (the  Committee)  chaired  by  the \nUndersecretary of DOF and comprising officials from DOF, DBM, and \nthe  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA)  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating the implementation and the sustaining of \nthe DPSP actions with the Borrower\u2019s DBM and relevant line agencies \nof the Borrower involved in supporting the Program. The Committee \nshall  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  the \nimplementation of the Program, and provide guidance and direction to \nthe Executing Agency and DBM.   \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The  DPSP  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  will  have  a  positive \nand Beneficiaries  impact on the poor.  \n \n(i)   Progress in fiscal consolidation will help to restore confidence in \nthe economy; promote macroeconomic stability; and foster broad-\nbased  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty  reduction. \nThese  are  the  cornerstones  of  the  Government\u2019s  MTPDP  and \nPDF. \n(ii)   The increase in tax revenues will enable more spending on the \nsocial sectors and this will have a direct positive impact on the \npoor. \n(iii)   The  reforms  will  improve  governance  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement, including the implementation of the medium-term \nexpenditure framework and procurement reforms. Anticorruption \ninitiatives will reduce wasteful spending and allow the Government \nto re-orient expenditure to the social sectors. \n(iv)   Transaction costs for business will be lower because of reductions \nin red tape, the elimination of all export fees and charges, and \nother investment reforms. The better investment climate will open \neconomic opportunities, increase investment and productivity, and \nlead to economic growth, higher incomes, and more jobs. \n(v)   Improvements  to  the  infrastructure  will  increase  the  long-term \ngrowth potential, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n   \n ", " iv \n \nRisks and  The  Program  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  MTPDP,  the  Philippines \nAssumptions  Development  Forum  (PDF),  and  ongoing  fiscal  consolidation.  The \nassumptions underlying the Program include the following.   \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic and political stability will continue. \n(ii)  The  economy  will  be  able  to  withstand  external  or  domestic \nshocks. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  policy  reform \nmeasures, and will liaise effectively with Congress.  \n \nHowever, there are risks to the Program.  \n \n(i)  Political  instability  could  affect  the  pace  of  reform  and  the \nperformance of the economy. However, although the considerable \npolitical disturbances during 2005 had an impact on spreads on \ninternational bonds, domestically the reforms moved ahead, albeit \nwith a delay.  \n(ii)  The elections for Congress in 2007 will not affect policy actions \nunder  subprogram  1  as  all  the  policy  measures  had  been \ncompleted by  mid-October 2006 before Board consideration in \nearly 2007. The elections may delay legislative reforms and slow \nthe reform momentum in 2007 if there are personnel changes at \nthe  senior  level  in  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies. \nHowever,  many  of  the  triggers  for  the  subprogram  2  involve \nimplementing legislative reforms in 2006 or executive orders and \nthus the risk to the overall reform agenda is relatively low.  \n(iii)  The external environment may deteriorate if persistently high oil \nprices result in a slowdown in world economic growth and trade, \nand create unfavorable conditions in world financial markets. This \nwould translate into slower growth in the Philippines and increase \nfiscal stress. However, to a certain extent this may be mitigated by \nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  package,  which  includes  tax \nreforms  and  a  reduction  in  wasteful  public  spending  through \nrationalization. \n(iv)  The Government may lack the commitment to implement reforms \nand  there  may  be  weak  coordination  among  government \nagencies. However, the Government appears strongly committed \nto the DPSP reform program, which is embedded in the MTPDP \nand the PDF.  The Government has taken a clear policy stance on \nthe  need  for  rapid  policy  adjustment  on  the  domestic  front \nfollowing the fiscal and macroeconomic instability of 2002\u20132004. \n(v)  The  capacity  of  agencies  to  implement  reforms  may  be \nconstrained by lack of resources and other emerging priorities \nduring  elections  in  2007.  However,  many  donors  are  also \nsupporting the reforms through technical assistance.  \n(vi)  There  will  be  resistance  to  the  reforms  from  vested  interests. \nInstitutionalizing governance reforms in BIR, BOC, and selected \nline ministries is likely to be a long drawn-out process. There have \nbeen  disappointing  outcomes  in  recent  high-profile  corruption \ncases. However, several factors will mitigate these risks. First, the \nDPSP  strategic  approach  is  to  focus  efforts  on  supporting \n ", "  v \nGovernment\u2019s  initiatives  (a)  to  improve  integrity  in  revenue \ncollection  in  BIR  and  BOC,  and  (b)  to  strengthen  public \nexpenditure  management  in  four  key  national  agencies  with \nsignificant  procurement  budgets  (DPWH,  DepEd,  DOH,  DA). \nSecond, the reforms focus on areas where there is political will, \nand some measure of capacity. Third, DOF and OMB\u2019s reform \nprograms are strongly supported by technical support from key \ndonors  such  as  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), which is supporting reforms at the BIR and \nBOC; the European Union (EU), which is providing assistance to \nthe OBM; the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), which is supporting reforms at the Commission of Audit; \nand the World Bank, which is assisting the DOF and DBM on tax \nadministration and expenditure management. \n   \nTechnical  Advisory TA will be provided with the DPSP. The TA is estimated to \nAssistance  cost $1.15 million equivalent. ADB will finance $800,000 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF). \n \nThe TA will support NEDA, DBM, DOF, and the Department of Trade \nand Industry (DTI) to implement and monitor key policy reforms, and in \nparticular to broaden and deepen the investment policy reform agenda \nduring the DPSP period. The TA will have three components. Under \ncomponent 1, it will carry out a provincial competitiveness survey of \nbusinesses and construct a provincial competitiveness index to help the \nGovernment to monitor the impact of reforms, identify emerging issues \naffecting  the  investment  climate,  and  track  progress  in  economic \ngovernance in the provinces. Under component 2, it will strengthen \nanalytical support and capacity for the Government\u2019s efforts to facilitate \nprivate  sector  development  in  the  services  sector,  with  a  focus  on \nemerging  growth  sectors  in  the  domestic  distribution  sector.  Under \ncomponent 3, it will support efforts by NEDA, DBM, DOF, and DTI to \nimprove  competitiveness  through  further  policy  reforms  including \ninvestment incentives, trade policy and institutions, and business red \ntape and regulatory reform.    \n   \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP)  comprising  three \nsubprograms, and (ii) a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nDPSP. The DPSP supports a common policy reform program prepared by a joint team of \nrepresentatives of the Government of the Philippines, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and \nthe World Bank. This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for improving the \ninvestment climate and business competitiveness and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Development Strategies and the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan  \n2.  In  2004,  the  Government  announced  a  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan \n(MTPDP),  1  2004\u20132010  setting  out  the  country\u2019s  development  priorities,  policy  agenda, \nprograms, and projects for the next 6 years. The MTPDP was a departure from the previous \nsector-based  approach.  A  heavy  emphasis  was  laid  on  targets  and  outcomes,  and  all \ngovernment agency activities (including projects) in all sectors were prioritized according to their \npotential contribution to outcomes. To improve operational efficiency, agencies were to be \nstreamlined to deliver core functions according to their mandated outcomes.  \n \n3.  The key objectives of the MTPDP are to achieve higher and more sustainable economic \ngrowth, create jobs, reduce poverty, and make progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs).  Structured around the President\u2019s Ten-Point Legacy Agenda,2 the MTPDP \nfocuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job creation; (ii) energy independence and \npower sector reforms; (iii) social justice and basic needs; (iv) education and youth opportunities; \nand (v) anticorruption and governance activities (Figure 1). It identifies the major challenges as:  \nthe fiscal imbalance; inadequate infrastructure; rapid urbanization and congestion, especially in \nMetro Manila; increasing unemployment; and inefficient delivery of basic services.    \n \n4.  In  2005,  the  Government  and  its  international  development  partners  converted  the \nannual consultative group meetings into the Philippines Development Forum (PDF). 3 The PDF \nprovides an opportunity for an ongoing dialogue with other stakeholders from civil society, the \nprivate sector, and the academic community. The Government convenes the PDF to discuss the \nreform  agenda  and  the  ways  donors  can  assist  implementation.  The  PDF  allows  the \ndevelopment partners to enhance their policy engagement with the Government and to provide \nan impetus to the implementation of the MTPDP. Currently the PDF has seven working groups, \neach focusing on priority areas of the Government\u2019s development agenda: (i) economic and \nfiscal  reforms;  (ii) governance  and  anticorruption  activities;  (iii)  growth  and  investment; \n(iv) MDGs and social progress; (v) decentralization and local government; (vi) sustainable rural \ndevelopment; and (vii) Mindanao. In March 2006, the Government agreed with the World Bank \nto use the PDF agenda as the basis for a World Bank development policy loan (DPL). Shortly \nafter the workshop, ADB was invited to join the process and to jointly prepare the reform agenda \n                                                 \n1  Philippines, Government of the. 2004.

The Government and its Development Partners \n5.  The  proposed  Development  Policy  Support  Program  loans  will  support  the  broad \npriorities of the Government\u2019s agenda, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed \nto  the  President  of  ADB  (Appendix  2).  These  broad  areas  include  (i)  fiscal  consolidation, \nmacroeconomic stability, and creditworthiness; (ii) governance and anticorruption policies; (iii) \nthe  investment  climate  and  infrastructure;  and  (iv) social  inclusion  (Figure  2).  The  close \nalignment between its own reform agenda and the DPSP will strengthen the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the reforms under the DPSP.  \n \n ", "  3\n6.  The Medium-Term Programmatic Approach. The World Bank\u2019s country assistance \nstrategy (CAS)4 lays out the rationale for a series of development policy loans (DPLs), subject to \nprogress  in  fiscal  consolidation,  governance,  and  the  investment  climate.  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program (CSP) 2005-2007,5 indicated that ADB would consider cofinancing the \nproposed single tranche development policy loan contemplated by the World Bank in its CAS, \nsubject to continued progress in fiscal reforms by the Government.6  The Government is on \ntrack to meet the CSP\u2019s fiscal targets of a national government budget deficit of 1.4% of GDP by \n2007 (currently the deficit is estimated to be about 1.8% for 2006), and a reduction in the \nconsolidated public sector (CPSD) budget deficit by 10% per annum from the 2004 baseline \ndeficit of 4.8% of GDP (the CPSD is currently about 2%).  \n \n7.  The proposed DPSP cluster provides (i) a coherent reform strategy with discrete but \nlinked three subprograms; (ii) a strong emphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to \nproceed with the next subprogram is contingent on satisfactory performance of the triggers; and \n(iii) flexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating lessons learned and \nresponding to changes in the external environment in the design of downstream subprograms. \nThe proposed DPSP for the Philippines is modeled on a similar ADB program for Indonesia,7 \nwhich is also jointly financed by a World Bank development policy loan. The key features of the \nIndonesia DPSP include (i) a series of single tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-\nterm framework specified at the outset and including completed high-impact reforms prior to \nBoard consideration; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms so as to ensure a continuous \ndialogue between the Government, development partners, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small \nnumber of well-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-impact outcomes in priority \nsectors.   \n \n8.  Subprogram 1 of the Philippines DPSP will be financed by ADB ($250 million) and the \nWorld Bank\u2019s DPL ($250 million). The World Bank\u2019s DPL was approved by its Board on 14 \nDecember 2006, while ADB\u2019s DPSP is scheduled for Board consideration in February 2007. \nSubprogram  1  focuses  on  fiscal  consolidation  and  enhanced  governance  in  public  sector \nfinancial management and will create the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement \nover the period 2007\u20132009.  \n \n9.  Subprogram 2 will continue the momentum of the reforms in subprogram 1, and will be \nfinanced  by  the  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  In  addition  to  continuing  fiscal  consolidation, \nsubprogram 2 will support the Government\u2019s governance agenda in key government revenue-\ncollecting agencies under the Department of Finance (DOF), and expenditure management \nunder the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and selected line ministries covering \ninfrastructure  and  social  sectors.  Subprogram  2  will  increase  the  focus  on  improving  the \ninvestment climate, laying the groundwork for a more substantial reform agenda in 2008.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Economy, Investment Climate and Poverty \n15.  Sustained  Macroeconomic  Performance  in  2006. The Philippine economy ended \n2005 with overall annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5%. This was down from \n6.2% in 2004, but above the average growth rate of 4.3% per annum from 1990 to 2005. Table \n1 presents data on key indicators over 2003\u20132006 to show the recovery and restoration of \nmacroeconomic stability since 2004. The economy expanded by 5.4% in the first three quarters \nof 2006. Services have been the fastest growing sector with an average growth rate of 6.7% \nsince 2003, contributing to almost 60% of economic growth, followed by manufacturing and \nutilities. On the demand side, consumption spending contributed to 70\u201380% of economic growth, \nfollowed by a recent surge in exports. The upturn in the economy in 2006, despite higher oil \n ", "6     \n \nprices, indicates the Philippine economy is becoming more resilient, and has not been matched \nby its Asian neighbors. However, the investment rate has declined since 2003, although it may \nhave bottomed out in 2005. Inflation accelerated in 2004 to peak at 8.6% at the end of 2004, \nfalling to 6.6% in December 2005. Inflation jumped a little after the value added tax (VAT) \nincrease  in  February  2006,  but  has  since  declined  and  annual  inflation  reached  4.7%  in \nNovember (year-on-year). NEDA estimates year-end inflation in the range of 5.2\u20135.7% for 2006. \nPrudent monetary management has helped reduce inflation and consequently domestic interest \nrates continue to inch down. The 91-day Treasury bill rate averaged 5.6% in 2006, compared \nwith 5.9% in 2005 and 7.6% in 2004. Record inflows of remittances have contributed to a higher \ncurrent account surplus, which in turn has helped to stabilize household consumption against \nthe backdrop of higher oil prices and VAT increases.  \n \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in the Philippines \n(percentage of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n \nIndicator   2003 2004 2005  2006 est \nReal GDP growth (%)  4.9 6.2 5.0  5.5\nInvestment  16.8 16.8 15.1  15.2\n   Private investment    14.5 12.9  12.8\n   Public investment    2.3 2.2  2.4\nTotal employment (million, average of the period)  31.6 31.6 32.3  33.0\nAnnual Inflation (%, average of period)  3.5 6.0 7.6  6.7\nAnnual Inflation (%, year-end)  3.9 8.6 6.6  5.2\u20135.7\nM2 growth (% annual growth)  3.3 9.2 9.0  12.3\nExternal debt  72.1 63.3 55.1  55.9\nDebt service ratio (percentage of exports)  22.5 18.6 18.9  19.8\nCurrent account balance  0.4 1.9 2.4  2.4\nGross official reserves ($ billion)  17.1 16.3 18.5  21.9\n   \nPublic finances   \nConsolidated public sector budget balance  (5.2) (4.8) (2.0)  (1.8)\n  National government budget balance   (4.6) (3.8) (2.7)  (1.8)\n  GOCCs balance  (1.5) (1.8) (0.4)  (0.8)\n  Others a  0.9 0.8 1.1  0.8\n   \nRevenues and grants  20.9 20.5 22.1  23.1\n  Tax revenues b  12.4 12.3 13.0  14.2\nExpenditures  19.5 18.6 18.1  17.9\n  Current expenditures  16.8 15.8 15.6  15.3\n  Capital and equity expenditures  2.6 2.7 2.4  2.5\n   \nNon-financial public sector balancec  (5.6) (5.0) (2.1)  (1.8)\nNon-financial public sector debt  101 95 87  79\nNational government debt  78 71 72  70\n( ) = negative, GDP= gross domestic product, GOCC= government owned and controlled corporation.  \na  Includes social security institutions, local government units and others. \nb  Beginning 2005, tax revenues includes non-cash collections equivalent to 0.4% of GDP in 2005. \nc  Fund  definition  of  non-financial  public  sector  balance  does  not  match  the  Government\u2019s  definition  of  the \nconsolidated public sector balance.

The improved fiscal situation and \nrobust economic growth has begun to shift investor perceptions about the medium-term outlook \nfor  the  Philippine  economy.  Sovereign  borrowing  costs  have  fallen,  with  spreads  on \nGovernment bonds denominated in US dollars cut in half in 2006 from 2004 levels. There has \nbeen an increase in capital flows, and the Philippine peso has appreciated by about 6.7% \nagainst the US dollar since the start of the year, and has averaged about P50.8 to US$1 in the \nlast 5 months of 2006. All three major international rating agencies have improved their outlooks \nfor the Philippine economy. Fitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s improved their outlooks for Philippine \nsovereign credit from negative to stable in early 2006, followed by Moody\u2019s, which upgraded its \nnegative outlook to stable in October. However, these ratings are still two levels from investment \ngrade (Fitch), three levels from investment grade (Standard & Poor\u2019s), and four levels from \ninvestment grade (Moody\u2019s).  \n \n17.  Turnaround in the Government\u2019s Fiscal Management. After implementing several \ndifficult tax and fiscal measures, the consolidated public sector (CPSD) deficit as a share of the \ngross domestic product (GDP) declined from a peak of 5.2% in 2003 to an estimated 1.8% in \n2006, aided by a better-than-expected fall in the National Government (NG) budget deficit\u2014\nestimated at 1.8% of GDP in 2006, well below its programmed target deficit of 2.1%. The fiscal \ndeficit through to November 2006 is estimated at P58 billion, half the deficit level during the \nsame period in 2005.10 Tax revenues have performed strongly in 2006 to date, growing by 19% \nthrough October (year on year), with VAT revenues growing by 64%. Overall, tax revenues \nlooked set to rise by about 1% of GDP in 2006, the first increase of any significance in a decade.  \n \n18.  Modest Formal Employment Growth. About an average of 650,000 jobs were created \nin the first 10 months of 2006 or a growth rate of 2% over the 2005 level.  Formal employment \ngrew by an average of 1.5% and informal employment expanded by 2.5%. Moreover, the growth \nhas not been sufficient to more than offset increases in the labor force. Consequently, the youth \nunemployment rate remains persistently high at 18.7%. While current economic growth rates \nexplain part of the insufficient job creation in the formal sector, restrictive labor regulations have \nalso contributed to the persistence of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment. Based \non ADB staff estimates, economic growth of about 6\u20137% per annum over the next 4 years will \nbe required to create close to the government\u2019s target of 4 million new jobs by 2010. The \nchallenge for the Government will be to increase investment rates well above the current 15% of \nGDP to achieve higher and more sustainable economic growth over the longer term.  \n   \n19.  Progress in Reducing Poverty. The most recent family income and expenditure survey \n(FIES)11 indicated that poverty had declined from 33% in 2000 to 30% in 2003, based on daily \ncaloric intake. Poverty incidence based on the $2 a day poverty measure also declined from \n46.7% in 2000 to 41.9% in 2005. Real per capita incomes have increased across all income \ngroups, with the poorest groups experiencing a real increase of 10% between 2000 and 2003. \nWith per capita GDP growing 2.9% to 4.0% per year since 2004, and with large inflows of \nremittances,  further  declines  in  the  poverty  rate  can  be  expected,  but  these  need  to  be \naccelerated.  \n \n                                                 \n10  Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance. 2006.

Issues and Opportunities   \n1.  Fiscal Consolidation and Macroeconomic Stability \n20.   Tax Revenue Effort. After improving in the first half of the 1990s, the Philippines\u2019 fiscal \nfortunes  quickly  reversed  following  the  Asian  crisis.  In  the  mid-1990s,  budget  revenues \nincreased markedly and the CPSD budget was almost balanced. Public debt was on a clear \ndeclining path. Fiscal reforms in the late 1980s to mid-1990s\u2014including the introduction of VAT \nin 1988\u2014helped to improve fiscal sustainability in the mid-1990s. Then came the Asian crisis, \ntax revenues plunged, the CPSD deficit increased sharply and public debt began to climb (see \nFigure 3). The fiscal position of the Philippines in the 1990s was adversely affected by: (i) the \nfact that important sectors, including energy, were exempted from VAT; (ii) the erosion of the \nincome tax base caused by the proliferation of tax incentives in new growth sectors of the \neconomy; and (iii) persistently weak tax administration. These policies were maintained for \nseveral  years  after  the  crisis,  and,   combined a   with  deterioration  in  governance  and  tax \nadministration efforts in the revenue collecting agencies, caused  a further deterioration in the \nfiscal position. Recent fiscal measures (including a broadening of the tax base, elimination of \nexemptions from VAT, an increase in excise taxes, improvements in tax administration, and a \nreduction in unproductive spending) have helped address the problem of fiscal sustainability. \nThe Government has therefore advanced its target of a balanced budget from 2010 to 2008. \nAdditional  reforms  in  taxation,  rationalization  of  fiscal  incentives,  improving  management \nperformance  of  government  owned  and  controlled  corporations  (GOCCs),  and  tax \nadministration (such as cleaning, updating and expanding the tax registration database) will be \nnecessary to achieve this target and ensure the fiscal adjustment is sustainable. International \ncomparisons of tax revenue to GDP ratios suggest that there is much upside potential for \nimproving tax revenue performance in the Philippines (Appendix 4).   \n \nFigure 3: Tax Revenue and Expenditure as Share of GDP\n%\n18 Tax revenue ratio\n17\n16 Government primary expenditure\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6\n9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\nSource: Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing, Republic of the Philippines, various years.\n \n \n21.  Expenditure  Management.  Fiscal  sustainability  also  requires  reforms  on  the \nexpenditure side. A well functioning budget and financial management system comprises of \nthree core elements. First, a medium-term framework in budgeting that aligns allocations more \nexplicitly to the government\u2019s policy priorities. The second element is a performance-based \nmanagement system to ensure operational efficiency at the government agency level. Finally, a \n ", "  9\nfinancial management information system to ensure budget transparency.  In the Philippines, \nrecent  reports  and  audits  have  highlighted  several  critical  weaknesses  in  expenditure \nmanagement, resulting in poor expenditure allocation and control, wastage, and unpredictability \nof funds for long-term priority programs. These weaknesses include: (i) a lack of consistency \nbetween the ambitious (and extensive) planning process and the composition of the budget, \ncompounded by policy being made continuously throughout the budget cycle; (ii) the practice of \nincremental budgeting, whereby budget allocations increase incrementally for similar programs \nand projects; and (iii) an inadequate framework for performance-based budgeting in government \ndepartments and agencies.  Moreover, there needs to be a rebalancing of the composition of \nGovernment budget expenditures. Budget allocations are biased toward statutory expenditure \noutlays\u2014government  wages,  transfers  to  LGUs,  interest  payments\u2014over  spending  on \ninfrastructure,  maintenance  and  social  sectors.  Statutory  outlays  as  a  percentage  of  total \nGovernment expenditure went up by over 11 percentage points to 75% in 2005 from the 1990 \nlevel. This marked change in expenditure composition led to less flexible budgets, which limited \ndiscretionary expenditure policy to cuts in spending on capital projects, maintenance, and the \neducation  and  health  sectors  (Figure  6).  The  intention  of  the  government  to  allocate  a \nsubstantial proportion of VAT revenues to priority sectors in the 2006 and 2007 budgets was a \nstep  in  the  right  direction.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  expenditure  management \nissues  through  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  (MTEF),  which  links  annual \nbudgeting  decisions  to  medium-term  spending  constraints  and  contains  a  3-year  rolling \nprojection  (or  forward  estimates)  of  expenditure  requirements  of  approved  programs  and \nprojects. The MTEF has been only partially implemented (e.g., no budget ceilings have been \nimposed) and the pace of implementation has been slow (it is being implemented in only two \ndepartments although it was first introduced in 2001). It is important that the MTEF be fully \nimplemented  and  expanded  across  all  national  agencies  to  improve  the  budget  planning \nprocess and impose fiscal discipline.  \n \n22.  Debt  Management. Debt management policy needs to be stronger to ensure debt \nsustainability over the long term, including addressing contingent liabilities. Debt sustainability \nassessments indicate that there is a need to improve management of the risks of existing debt \nand  to  diversify  the  liability  portfolio,  given  the  vulnerability  to  movements  in  such \nmacroeconomic variables as GDP growth, interest rates, and exchange rates. Some progress \nhas been made in debt management in recent years, particularly in lengthening the average \nmaturity of government debt and in maintaining a diverse portfolio of obligations. However, this \nprogress needs to be extended to reduce the vulnerability of the budget and economy to \nmacroeconomic  fluctuations.  The  growing  stock  of  debt  outside  the  Government\u2019s  own \nborrowing program, such as that of GOCCs and government financial institutions (GFIs), and \nthe challenge of accurately quantifying and assessing the level of contingent liabilities, as well \nas the assets of GOCCs, add to the risks. An ongoing ADB TA project aims to improving the \nnational  debt  and  risk  management  function  and  establish  a  process  of  more  effective \nmonitoring and coordination of debt and risk management functions. The TA project is expected \nto be completed by June 2007.12  \n  \n2.  Governance in Public Expenditure Management and Anti-corruption \n23.  The DPSP cluster recognizes that governance issues are central to the widespread \nperception that the Philippines is becoming less competitive and a less attractive destination for \ninvestment. The 2004 ADB-World Bank Investment Climate Survey13 found corruption to be the \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005.

On the other hand, the SWS indicates that businesses are \noffering fewer bribes. The latest World Bank Governance Matters 2006: Worldwide Governance \nIndicators16 provide a scorecard on governance performance across countries based on six \nindicators: (i) voice and accountability; (ii) political stability; (iii) government effectiveness; (iv) \nregulatory quality; (v) rule of law and (vi) control of corruption. The Philippines has had declining \nscores in all six indicators since 1998, bottoming out in 2004, with five indicators improving in \n2005  (Table  2).  While  each  indicator  in  2005  remains  below  its  1998  peak,  government \neffectiveness and regulatory quality showed the best improvement, with a small improvement \nalso being registered in control of corruption. The voice and accountability indicator continued to \ndecline in 2005 (see Appendix 4 for a discussion of governance measures and performance).    \n \nTable 2: Governance Indicators\u2014Philippines \n \nYear  Voice and  Political  Government  Regulatory  Rule  Control of \n  Accountability  Stability  Effectiveness   Quality  of Law  Corruption \n1998  58.9  39.2  63.2  68.5  55.3  50.5 \n2000  54.6  29.2  61.2  58.6  38.9  36.8 \n2002  52.2  24.1  56.0  53.7  31.7  34.8 \n2004  48.3  12.3  50.2  47.3  32.7  34.8 \n2005  47.8  17.5  55.5  52.0  38.6  37.4 \nNote: The indicators present percentile rankings for each country.

Improvements have been initiated and there have been important improvements in the \nbureaucracy that demonstrate that the Philippines is making gradual progress in some areas. \nRecent innovative anticorruption revenue and expenditure management initiatives in BIR, BOC \nand DBM have produced encouraging outcomes including the following.   \n \n(i)  There has been an increase in the number of tax files and greater tax collection \nfrom identified tax evaders. Revenue collected from tax evaders increased by \n45% in the first year of operation of the run-after-tax-evaders (RATE) and run-\nafter-smugglers (RATS) programs. The Millennium Challenge Corporation has \nprovided a $21 million grant to the DOF and the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) \nto strengthen its governance initiatives. \n(ii)  The implementation of a Lateral Attrition Law has provided incentives to BIR and \nBOC officials to collect taxes and duties more efficiently.   \n(iii)  The budget of the OMB has been doubled to better equip the office to fight \ncorruption in the bureaucracy.  \n(iv)  The OMB has completed integrity development reviews (IDR) in the government \nagencies perceived as being the most corrupt by respondents to the Social \n                                                 \n14 Transparency International. 2005.

These  early  successes  in  good  governance  and  fighting  corruption  have  not  yet \ntranslated into positive changes of perception by the wider audience. To some extent the \nongoing high-profile corruption cases have clouded perceptions about the Government\u2019s recent \ninnovative initiatives to strengthen governance. The persistent perceptions of poor performance \nin this area also indicate the challenges the Government faces if it is to create credibility in its \ngovernance strategy. Therefore, it will be important for the Government to make significant \nprogress in governance initiatives in its revenue and expenditure management program.  \n \n26.

Much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  improve \ngovernance in public expenditure management and to control corruption, in particular to ensure \nthat the medium-term expenditure framework is implemented at government agencies, so that \nsystems  and  processes  for  allocating  and  executing  budgetary  resources  become  more \ntransparent and efficient. It will be important to support implementation of the MTEF through \nmeasures that increase transparency and accountability and thus reduce the scope for undue \ndiscretion in budget execution. This will require greater disclosure of budget releases and \ndisbursements in a format that allow DBM, the private sector and civil society to easily track and \nmatch realized expenditures of line agencies with budget allocations. The Department of Budget \nand  Management  has  introduced  measures  to  improve  transparency  and  efficiency  in  the \nbudgeting process, including taking initial steps to develop an integrated government financial \nmanagement information system (GFMIS). It will be important to complete the design and \ndevelopment of the GFMIS to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the services and to \nimprove transparency.  \n \n27.  Procurement.  Procurement  is  an  important  area  where  increased  competition, \ntransparency, and monitoring have the potential to enhance the cost-efficiency of resource use \nand to improve governance. The Government Procurement Reform Act, 2003, consolidated all \nrules  of  public  procurement;  mandated  the  use  of  the  electronic  government  procurement \nsystem, PhilGEPS; and required the participation of private and nongovernment organization \n(NGO) observers in the procurement process. The act is a significant step in streamlining \nprocurement rules and regulations to enhance transparency and accountability.  In addition, the \nreforms have meant there has been a gradual convergence between Philippine procurement \nsystems  and  international  standards.  Philippine  systems  are  becoming  more  like  the \nframeworks already used by the country\u2019s large multilateral partners.17 The implementation of \nthe Procurement Reform Act resulted in savings estimated at P400 million in 2005 and has \ncontributed to a 50% reduction in the cost of textbooks since 2000.18 However, anecdotal \nevidence  shows  there  are  still  huge  leaks  in  government  spending  due  to  corruption  in \nprocurement, in part due to inadequate public disclosure of procurement transactions, and weak \nenforcement of procurement rules and procedures. Therefore, it will be important to continue \nwith reforms implementing the Procurement Reform Act to enhance the capacity of government \n                                                 \n17 Thornton, N. 2006.

Civil Service. Civil service reform is another important area with the potential to improve \npublic sector efficiency. The Philippine bureaucracy is administratively overstretched and this \nmakes  institutionalizing  much-needed  reforms  extremely  difficult.  There  is  duplication  and \noverlapping of programs and activities, uncoordinated policy and program implementation, poor \nsector management, wasteful use of resources, and excessive red tape. Public service delivery \nis  constrained  by  a  lack  of  qualified  personnel  and  uncompetitive  compensation  levels. In \naddition, DBM, the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and the Government Service Insurance \nSystem (GSIS) currently maintain their own personnel databases and this makes it difficult for \nhuman resource management and planning. Given fiscal constraints, it is clear that the size and \ncost of the civil service requires review and adjustment, including (i) establishing an effective \nsystem  to  control  employment  and  the  wage  bill,  (ii)  increasing  transparency  and  the \ncompetitiveness of civil service compensation and (iii) clarifying, designing and implementing a \nstrategy for adjusting the core missions, functions and structure of government agencies along \nwith budget and administrative structural reforms. The Government has drafted a compensation \nbill that aims to rationalize and standardize the salaries of civil servants at all levels of the \ngovernment and to bring salary scales into line with those in the private sector to attract and \nretain highly qualified staff. The bill has been submitted to Congress.  Supporting reforms to \nintegrate civil service personnel databases will also be needed.  \n \n3.  Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n29.  The Private Sector. After rapidly expanding in the first half of the 1990s, investment \ngrowth in the Philippines slumped following the Asian crisis and has been slow to recover, a \ncharacteristic shared with all the other crisis-hit countries since 1998 (Figure 4). The Philippines \nwas investing the equivalent of 25% of its GDP before the crisis but this has now declined to \n15%. Lost investments have been translated into lost growth, and in turn to slow creation of jobs \nand poverty reduction. The decline in investment covers both private and public investments. \nThe average annual infrastructure spending between 2001 and 2005 was 2.4% of GDP, which \nwas low compared with that in other countries in the region, and well below pre-crisis levels \n(when it approached 8%). While there are tentative signs of a weak investment recovery in 2006, \nthis has been much slower than in some of the comparable economies in the region (e.g., \nThailand since 2002 and Indonesia since 2004).  \n \n ", "  13\nFigure 4: Investment as Share of GDP\n% of GDP Malaysia \n45\nRepublic of Korea  Thailand \n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\nPhilippines \nIndonesia \n5\n0\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nSource: National Income Accounts of the five countries. \n \n \n30.  A critical challenge facing the Philippines is how to increase investment significantly in \nthe medium term. The Government will need to implement measures in a number of areas such \nas improving the investment climate, and establishing a transparent framework for infrastructure \ndevelopment, including improving the resource efficiency of public infrastructure spending as a \ncorollary to fiscal consolidation efforts. \n \n31.  Businesses Constraints and Unfavorable Perceptions of the Investment Climate. \nThe ADB-World Bank Investment Climate Survey (footnote 11) in 2003 reported several major \nconstraints in the Philippines, including macroeconomic instability, followed by corruption, high \nelectricity rates, policy uncertainty, tax administration, and anticompetitive practices (Figure 5). \nAccording to the IFC Doing Business Report for 2006,19 it takes 11 steps to launch a business \nand about 48 days to carry them out in the Philippines (in Malaysia it takes 30 days, Thailand 33 \ndays, Viet Nam 50 days, and Indonesia 97 days). A recent Social Weather Survey (footnote 13) \nof businesses suggests that investor perceptions about red tape and associated corruption have \ndeteriorated recently, with Philippine businesses experiencing increased difficulties with red \ntape  at  the  Land  Transportation  Office,  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),  and  BOC.    The \ninvestment incentives framework is complicated, involving several administering agencies and \n64 different laws on incentives. Consequently the framework has become cumbersome and \nuncoordinated with the national economic strategy. Moreover, it has encouraged widespread \nrevenue leakage as some of the incentives are redundant. The Government is looking at ways \nto rationalize the investment incentives regime and a rationalization of fiscal incentives bill is \npending in Congress. The incentives framework must be streamlined and its administration \nimproved to minimize revenue leakage.  \n                                                 \n19 World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2006.

Inadequate Infrastructure, Especially Roads. Roads and inter-island shipping account \nfor almost all freight and passenger traffic.  While the road sector has made some progress in \nthe past few years, high levels of congestion, the poor condition of large portions of the road \nnetwork, inadequate connectivity, and the lack of a sustainable road safety strategy reduce the \nefficiency of the road network. As a result, for example, inter-city freight rates in the Philippines \nare more than 50% higher than those in Thailand or Viet Nam. Chronic underinvestment in the \nnational road network is a characteristic of budgetary stress and unresponsive investment \nchoices. The Government has since increased funds allocated to road maintenance due to \nrising contributions from road users in a Special Road Fund. But these are still only about one \nthird of the estimated needs, and plans for achieving full cost recovery have been lagging. \nPrivate  sector  investment  has  been  low  and  has  declined  in  recent  years  because  of  an \nuncertain  investment  climate,  a  poor  legal  environment,  and  land  acquisition  problems. \nInvestors are concerned about the policy, legal and regulatory distortions in the infrastructure \nsector, and face significant legal risks as recourse to the judicial system is protracted and \nuncertain. Weaknesses in the Build-Operate-and-Transfer (BOT) Law, and the policy framework \nfor  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  infrastructure,  and  lack  of  coordination  among  line \ndepartments also adversely affects infrastructure investment. The government is taking some \nmeasures to make road sector more viable for the private sector. For example it is increasingly \ncontracting out road maintenance to the private sector, whereby its share would grow from \nabout 50% in 2005 to 70% in 2007 and 100% by 2009.  \n \n33.  Infrastructure Investment Needs to Exceed 5% of GDP. At a PDF presentation in \nAugust 2006, NEDA indicated that the Government is targeting total infrastructure investment of \naround P1.7 trillion, including the State of the Nation Address projects (P372 billion).20 NEDA as \nthe planning agency for the Government is in the process of identifying 10 high-impact, well-\nprepared  and  implementation-ready  projects.  The  Government  needs  to  encourage  private \nsector participation in infrastructure, including public\u2013private partnerships (PPP), by reducing \n                                                 \n20 Philippines Development Forum. 2006.

The  BOT  law  needs  to  be  revised  so  policies  relating  to  award  of \nconcessions,  issuance  of  public  guarantees  and  provision  of  public  subsidies  are  more \ntransparent. This will increase the confidence of private operators and financiers in government \ncommitments.    Transaction  quality  needs  to  be  ensured  through  a  transparent  project \npreparation and bidding process. Timely contract completion needs to be ensured through \nbetter performance management of project managers and appropriate link to incentives and \nsanctions. There is a need for an effective mechanism for an independent and impartial review \nand audit of projects. \n \n4.  Social Inclusion \n34.  Social Sectors\u2019 Declining Share of the Budget Since 1999. Recent fiscal austerity \nmeasures  to  reduce  the  Government  deficit  have  disproportionately  hurt  social  policy \nexpenditures. This means the Philippines may have difficulty meeting some of its Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) targets, particularly those in education and health (Figure 6). Weak \ngovernance and inequality in resource allocation have also contributed to poor social sector \noutcomes.  \n \nFigure 6: Social Sector Share of Government Budget\n%\n18 Education spending\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\nHealth spending\n2\n0\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nSource: Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing, Republic of the Philippines, various years. \n \n \n35.  MDG Targets. The Philippines is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) targets, including the target for reducing extreme poverty, but is at risk of not meeting \nMDG target of universal primary education by 2015. While high school participation rates have \nincreased from 58% in 2001/02 to 60% in 2003/04, elementary participation rates have fallen \nfrom 97% in 1999/00 to 88.4% in 2003/04. The impact of the adverse fiscal position on the \nsector has been exacerbated by rapid population growth and consequently real government \nspending per student has fallen by an average of 3% per annum from 2000 to 2004.  \n \n36.  There is also a risk that the Philippines may not meet the MDG targets for reducing child \nmalnutrition and maternal mortality, although it is on track to achieve the targets for reducing \nchild mortality, controlling communicable diseases, and increasing access to water.  Low health \nservice quality and problems of financial and physical access for the poor lie behind this poor \nperformance.    Public  spending  on  health  (US$14  per  capita  per  year,  for  national,  local \ngovernment and social health insurance spending combined) and total spending (US$33 per \n ", "16    \n \ncapita per year, and 3.1% of GDP) on health in the Philippines are low for a country at its level \nof economic development, and have remained static for the past 8 years. This has resulted in \ngrowing inequalities, e.g., under-5 child mortality for the poorest 20% of households is 2.7 times \nhigher than for the richest 20%.   \n \n37.  The Government is well aware of these problems and is committed to improving quality \nand access to basic education and health care, reversing recent declines in performance.  The \n2007 budget allocates substantial real increases to the social sector (12% over the adjusted \n2006 budget). The larger share for the DepED is to increase provisions for the public school \nsystem and proved larger allocations for teacher recruitment, textbooks, school buildings and \nrepair and maintenance of schools, so as to widen coverage and improve quality.  In the health \nsector, with support from ADB\u2019s health sector development program, the Government has \nadopted a sector reform strategy and implementation plans to increase equity, sustainability and \nquality in the health system, particularly in health services that are critical for the poor and for \nthe  achievement  of  the  health-related  MDGs.21 The  proposed  2007  budget  allocates  real \nincreases  for  subsidies  for  the  health  insurance  contributions,  which  will  help  to  expand \nenrollment of poor families under the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP).  A program to \nwiden the access of the poor to low-cost medicines through the Botika ng Barangay will also \nbenefit.   The  Department  of  Health,  in collaboration  with  the  Philippines  Health  Insurance \nCorporation  and  selected  local  government  units  (LGUs),  will  work  to  make  increases  in \nPhilHealth enrollment sustainable, and take measures to reduce the exclusion of some poor \nfrom the PhilHealth indigent program (and the use of the services by the  non-poor). In this \nregard, improving governance in expenditure management in the social sectors will be important \nto prepare the ground for increased availability of resources as a result of fiscal consolidation. \n \n38.  Medium-term Strategy for Social Welfare and Protection. The Government\u2019s policy \nagenda  for  social  welfare  and  protection  is  at  an  earlier  stage  of  development  than  the \neducation and health strategies. The Department of Social Welfare and Development plans to \ndevelop a social welfare and protection reform strategy during the period of the DPSP, and a \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  for  social  welfare,  protection  and  development.    The \nGovernment is encouraging LGUs to plan and monitor local poverty reduction strategies, and to \nimprove the targeting of services and programs for the poor.  The Department of Social Welfare \nand Development (DSWD) plans to review social expenditure for a range of social assistance \nprograms,  including  cash  and  in-kind  transfer  programs,  and  to  undertake  an  impact \nassessment  of  some  of  its  major  anti-poverty  programs,  including  the  Self-Employment \nAssistance  Kaunlaran  (SEA-K)  and  the  poverty-targeted  KALAHI-CIDSS  community-driven \ndevelopment program.    \n \n39.  Community-based  Mapping  System.  The  data  for  local  planning,  monitoring  and \ntargeting  pro-poor  programs  are  limited  and  national  poverty  statistics  are  not  sufficiently \ndisaggregated  or  timely.  The  lack  of  data  has  been  a  critical  obstacle  to  developing  and \nmonitoring  the  effectiveness  of  pro-poor  programs  in  the  past.  To  address  this  gap,  the \nGovernment  is  advocating  the  use  of  community-based  poverty  mapping  (CBMS)  and  is \npromoting adoption of a standard CBMS by LGUs for pro-poor planning, poverty profiling and \nmonitoring, and program targeting. Currently, about 10% of LGUs are using the CBMS, and \nduring the next 3 years, the government plans to support greater use of CBMS by LGUs.  The \nGovernment anticipates that about half of LGUs will be using CBMS in 2009.  \n \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2004.

Lessons  \n40.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  several  areas  related  to  macroeconomic  stability \n(covering such areas as capital markets and the nonbank financial sector) and private sector \ndevelopment (transport, energy, and water) and has maintained an ongoing policy dialogue with \nthe Government. The ADB private sector assessment22 noted that ADB\u2019s public and private \nsector operations in the Philippines have produced mixed results over the years. This mixed \nperformance in operations provides some important lessons for policy lending. 23 These include \nthe following.  \n \n(i)  Political and macroeconomic stability is a critical factor behind the success of a \ndevelopment assistance program. \n(ii)  Success requires careful program preparation, involving detailed analytical work \nand active consultations with stakeholders. \n(iii)  Program  designs  should  be  relatively  simple.  Program  designs  that  are  too \ncomplex and impose excessive demands on the administrative capacities of the \nimplementing agencies are likely to fail. \n(iv)  Sustaining development impact requires close monitoring during implementation. \nThis  also  requires  precise  and  clear  measurable  indicators.  The  Philippine \nexperience  strongly  suggests  that  the  quality  of  program  monitoring  is  an \nimportant factor for success. \n(v)  The  success  of  the  assistance  program  depends  on  its  ability  to  nurture \ninstitutional development. Weak institutions have often been cited as one of the  \nprincipal causes of project failures in the Philippines. For effective development \nresults, the policy agenda needs to be backed by broader public sector reforms \nthat aim to address thematic and cross-cutting issues of governance, public \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  accountability.  The  development \ndebate emphasizes strengthening institutions, including policy-making processes, \ncapacity  building,  implementation  of  laws  and  policies,  and  improvements  in \nprocedures and systems. \n \n41.  In light of these lessons, evaluation studies increasingly recommend the following steps \nwhen designing adjustment lending. 24   \n \n(i)  The economic, social and political environment in which the reform agenda is \nplanned  and  the  degree  of  country  commitment,  ownership,  and  readiness \nshown by the Government need to be carefully assessed.  \n(ii)  The development agenda should encompass longer-term economic, social, and \ninstitutional issues, and include the flexibility to cope with emerging changes and \ninstitutional problems. \n(iii)  Broader  stakeholder  participation  is  needed  to  obtain  adequate  buy-in  and \ndiminish the influence of vested interests. \n(iv)  Macroeconomic and fiscal stability measures need to reinforce, and be supported \nby, a proper environment for investment, financial management, and governance.  \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2005.

As a result of these lessons, the World Bank has now moved increasingly to a series of \nsingle-tranche  operations,  with  a  well-defined,  medium-term  (programmatic)  framework \nspecified at the outset, including completed reform actions prior to Board consideration and \ntriggers  for  the  subsequent  operation.  ADB  has  moved  in  the  same  direction  through  its \nmedium-term multi-program cluster approach. The DPSP for the Philippines has incorporated \nthese lessons as well as those emerging from the review of ADB\u2019s approach to conditionality.25  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objective and Scope \n43.  The DPSP cluster aims to support the Government in its efforts to (i) achieve and \nsustain  higher  economic  growth  through  improved  fiscal  sustainability,  public  financial \nmanagement, and a better investment climate; and (ii) reduce poverty and unemployment by \nreorienting public expenditures to social policy and productive needs, and by strengthening \ngovernance in public financial management.  \n \n44.  The DPSP cluster includes a series of policy reforms which underpin the key priorities of \nPhilippines\u2019s  medium-term  growth  strategy  and  the  Philippine  Development  Forum.  These \nreforms are designed to accomplish the following results.  \n \n(i)  Restore  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and \nimprove  creditworthiness  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal  management \nthrough (a) raising tax revenues annually for the next 3 years, (b) strengthening \ntax  administration,  enforcement  and  reducing  revenue  leakages  through \nimproved  governance,  (c)  reducing  inefficient  spending  to  provide  room  for \nincreased  social  and  poverty-related  spending  and  infrastructure, \n(d) strengthening  the  debt  management  strategy  to  manage  government \ncontingent liabilities and risks prudently. \n(ii)  Enhance  governance  in  public  financial  management  and  combat \ncorruption  by  (a)  improving  public  expenditure  management  and  shifting  to \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework,  (b)  strengthening  performance \nmanagement  and  improving  public  service  delivery,  (c)  continuing  with \nprocurement  reform  and  (d)  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  anti-corruption \nrevenue programs.  \n(iii)  Improve the investment climate by (a) clarifying and strengthening the legal \nand  regulatory  framework  on  investments  and  (b)  facilitating  infrastructure \ndevelopment through greater public\u2013private participation and initiating steps for \nimproved coordination of infrastructure priorities.  \n(iv)  Protecting  the  social  sectors  by  sustaining  real  spending  on  health  and \neducation, improving targeting of programs, and improving service delivery and \nthe poverty orientation of public spending.  \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB.

Subprogram  1  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  operation  with  a  well-defined \nframework to align with the Government\u2019s MTPDP and the PDF. The policy reform agenda is \nalso supported by a proposed advisory TA to support the deepening and implementation of \nreforms over the DPSP period. Consideration of subprogram 2 will depend on satisfactory \naccomplishment of the policy triggers for subprogram 2. The design and monitoring framework \nof the DPSP is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter, policy matrix for subprogram 1 and \nthe overview of the DPSP medium-term program, including triggers for subprogram 2, are \ndescribed in Appendix 2. Appendix 3 presents the donor coordination matrix.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n46.  Subprogram 1 focuses on four of the seven core policy areas outlined in the PDF: \n(i) improved fiscal sustainability, macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) improved \ngovernance in public expenditure management and reduction in corruption, (iii) strengthening \nthe investment climate, and (iv) social inclusion. All 27 policy measures required for subprogram \n1 to begin had been carried out by mid-October 2006. \n  \n1.  Subprogram 1 Core Area 1: Improved Fiscal Sustainability, Macroeconomic \n  Stability and Creditworthiness \n47.  Subprogram 1 acknowledges that the Philippines has made positive progress in fiscal \nconsolidation since 2004, leading to a reduction in the CPSD deficit from 5.6% in 2002 to 2.0% \nin 2005. Subprogram 1 will support the Government\u2019s fiscal reforms that were undertaken in \n2006. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are to eliminate the public sector deficit by 2009 \nand to reduce the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt to below 65% of GDP by 2009. The \nfollowing measures were completed before subprogram 1 was presented to the Board. \n \n48.  Lower Public Sector Deficit. The reduction in the CPSD deficit from 4.8% in 2004 to \n2.0% in 2005, aided by a reduction in the National Government budget deficit from 3.8% in 2004 \nto 2.7% in 2005 and projected to fall below the government\u2019s deficit target of 2.1% in 2006 were \nmajor achievements and contributed significantly to the recent improvement in the Philippines\u2019 \ncredit rating outlook from BB- negative to BB- stable or equivalent. Corresponding with the \nimproved fiscal deficit situation, the NFPS debt to GDP ratio fell from 101% of GDP in 2003 to \n87% in 2005. National Government debt fell from 79% of GDP in 2004 to 72% in 2005 and is \nprojected to fall below 70% by the end of 2006.  \n \n49.  Higher  Tax  Revenues.  Tax  revenue  increased  by  19%  in  2006  (equivalent  to  an \nincrease in the tax/GDP ratio by 1% over 2005) which was a major factor in bringing down the \nGovernment deficit in 2006. The increase in tax revenues was achieved by several important \ntax reforms, which have also improved the medium-term sustainability of tax revenues. The \nfollowing tax reform measures were undertaken:26 \n \n(i)  VAT coverage was broadened in November 2005 by removing VAT exemptions \nfrom petroleum products and medical and legal services; \n(ii)  the VAT rate was increased from 10% to 12%, effective February 2006; \n(iii)  these reforms increased VAT collections by 64% in the first 11 months of 2006 \nover the same period in 2005;   \n                                                 \n26  Power generation tariffs increased in late 2004 and early 2005, which contributed to the elimination of the power \nsubsidy (except for the lifeline subsidy) and therefore balanced the National Power Corporation budget for 2005 \nand reduced the public sector consolidated debt. While this action is not part of the DPSP, it is included in the ADB \nPower Sector Reform Loan program. \n ", "20    \n \n(iv)  the corporate tax rate was increased from 32% to 35%; and \n(v)  excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol were increased by about 30% in December \n2004. \n \n50.  Reforms  to  Tax  Administration.  The  Government  established  a  high-level  tax \nadministration reform management team in the BIR in 2006 to oversee administration and to \nimplement tax administration reforms in 2006 and beyond. Reform initiatives launched in the \nBIR include the development and implementation of the revenue enhancement action plan.  \n \n2.

Subprogram 1 acknowledges the recent revenue enhancement measures initiated by \nthe DOF and the OBM, and the Government\u2019s early successes in improving governance and \nfighting corruption in the revenue collecting agencies under DOF. These efforts go hand in hand \nwith  the  key  Government  objectives  of  (i)  improving  the  quality  of  public  expenditure \nmanagement, (ii) strengthening performance management and enhancing the delivery of public \nservices, (iii) reforming procurement, and (iv) reducing corruption in revenue-collecting agencies.  \nThe  following  measures  toward  achieving  these  objectives  were  completed  prior  to  Board \nconsideration of subprogram 1. \n \n52.   Reforms to the Budget Process. An important initiative was the implementation of the \nMTEF for the 2007 budget, which was incorporated into the budget call (where DBM requests \nline agencies to submit their proposed budgets for the next fiscal year), based on the budget \nstrategy paper and initial forward estimates for 2007\u20132009. The budget strategy paper (BSP) is \npart of a process that mandates decision makers to confront budget allocation trade-offs at the \nbeginning of the budget process and keep in view the strategic priorities set by the government. \nThe MTEF has been formulated and implemented in the health and education sectors. As a \nresult of budget forward estimates, more allocations will be made for education, health, and \ninfrastructure in the 2007 budget. \n \n53.   In order to improve transparency in public expenditure management, the Government \nhas started posting budget releases for priority projects and internal revenue allocations (IRA) of \nLGUs on the DBM website.27 This information includes projects by location and type. The \nGovernment is developing an integrated government financial management system (GFMIS) to \nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of services, and to improve transparency and public \naccess to budget information. Some modules of the government financial management system \nhave already been developed. The DBM has introduced a web-enabled e-Budget System, \nwhich  has  greatly  improved  budget  administration.  By  computerizing  budget  releases  and \naccountability reports, processing time has been cut, transparency enhanced, and fraudulent \ndocuments detected. The DBM launched the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement \nSystem (PhilGEPS) to provide both government agencies and suppliers with a more open, \ntransparent and competitive environment. The Commission on Audit (COA) has developed an \nelectronic accounting system, the e-NGAS (based on the National Government Accounting \nSystems  [NGAS],  introduced  in  2002),  So  far,  the  e-NGAS  accounting  module  has  been \ninstalled in 73 national government agencies, 35 LGUs, and 7 GOCCs. Gradually, e-Budget, \nPhilGEPS,  and  e-NGAS  will  be  integrated  into  Government  financial  management  and \ninformation systems. These initiatives have meant that more budget information is disclosed to \ncivil society groups and other interested stakeholders, thus increasing accountability.  The next \n                                                 \n27  Department of Budget and Management. 2006. http://www.dbm.gov.ph \n ", "  21\nphase will be the design and implementation of a plan that integrates these systems into the \nGFMIS.   \n \n54.   Stronger Public Sector Performance Management. In a further effort to strengthen \npublic sector performance, the DBM piloted a performance-based budgeting process through \nthe adoption of an organizational performance indicator framework (OPIF). To date, the DBM \nhas worked with 20 departments to identify programs, activities, and programs in line with major \nfinal outputs (MFOs), directly supporting national and sectoral goals. The OPIF requires the \nagencies to specify their outcomes, MFOs, and performance indicators. The budget is allocated \nin accordance with the absorptive capacity of the agencies, the implementation readiness of \nnew  projects,  and  cost-efficiency  considerations.  The  government  has  incorporated \nimplementation of the OPIF in the 2007 budget call. In support of these performance-enhancing \ninitiatives, the CSC has completed a government human resources management information \nsystem in order to establish better control over the level and distribution of public sector staff. \nThis system has been completed and will be extended to the regions. The DBM, CSC and \nGovernment  Service  Insurance  System  (GSIS)  currently  maintain  their  own  personnel \ndatabases and there is a need to integrate these. A framework linking DBM\u2019s OPIF to the CSC\u2019s \npersonnel rating system for an integrated performance management system in government \nneeds to be developed.  \n \n55.  More  Public  Disclosure  of  Procurement  Budget  and  Releases.  An  electronic \nprocurement  system  (PhilGEPS)  will  be  the  only  portal  for  all  government  procurement \ntransactions. The first phase of PhilGEPS was completed in 2006 and has three main features: \n(i) an electronic bulletin board, which posts all procurement opportunities in government; (ii) a \nsupplier and subscriber registry, which is a listing of all contractors who wish to do business with \ngovernment;  and  (iii)  an  electronic  catalogue  listing  common  use  items  that  government \nagencies are required to purchase from the central purchasing agency. Since September 2006, \nPhilGEPS has been made accessible to the general public, with the posting of all bid awards by \ncentral offices of the targeted departments (DPWH, DOH, DepED, and DA). As a result of these \nnew systems, there has been a significant increase in the number of bid opportunities and \nawards posted on the PhilGEPS in 2006.28 The number of notices with awards increased from \n3,128 in January to September 2004 to 8,987 during the same period in 2006. The aggregate \namount of the awards posted went up from P4.4 billion to P21.2 billion.   \n  \n56.  Stronger  Anticorruption  Revenue  Programs. The number of cases filed with the \nDepartment  of  Justice  are:  65  cases  for  tax  evaders  filed  under  the  RATE  program;  16 \nsmuggling cases filed under RATS; and 43 cases filed under RIPS. The DOJ and the BIR \nsigned a Memorandum of Agreement creating a task force to expedite these cases.  In addition, \nto improve investigation and prosecution of tax and graft cases, the government has further \nstrengthened the OMB and DOF, and as result increased the conviction rate of cases filed by \nOMB  before  the  anti-corruption  court,  the  Sandiganbayan  (the  conviction  rate  for  cases \ninvolving high-ranking officials increased from 24% in 2004 to 33% in 2005). The OMB is \nrecovering proceeds from corruption. In early 2006, the amount of asset forfeiture petitions filed \nbefore the Sandiganbayan totaled P700 million. \n \n57.  Introduction  of  the  Integrity  Development  Review  (IDR).  The  IDR  examines  an \nagency's  practices  and  procedures  for  their  vulnerability  to  corruption  so  an  agency-wide \nanticorruption plan can be developed that reduces the opportunity for corruption. The OMB and \nthe Development Academy of the Philippines undertook a review of five selected agencies. So \n                                                 \n28 Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System. 2006. https://www.Philgeps.net \n ", "22    \n \nfar, IDRs have been completed in BIR, BOC, DPWH, Land Transportation Office, and the \nPhilippine National Police. The OMB has placed resident officers in the departments to help \ndevelop and implement an action plan on a voluntary basis, as it is deemed that buy-in from the \ndepartment is necessary for successful implementation. All five agencies are developing action \nplans for implementation in 2007. Finally, COA reports for all government agencies were made \npublic through the COA website, improving transparency and providing civil society with access \nto information.29 \n \n3.  Subprogram 1 Core Area 3: Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n58.  Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s agenda to improve competitiveness. The \nmain objective is to increase the share of GDP spent on investment and infrastructure. Reform \nareas  of  critical  significance  targeted  under  subprogram  1  include:  (a)  clarifying  and \nstrengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  on  investments  and  (b)  facilitating \ninfrastructure development. The following measures toward achieving these objectives were \ncompleted prior to Board consideration of subprogram 1. \n \n59.  Measures  to  Reduce  Transaction  Costs  for  Businesses  and  Improve \nCompetitiveness.  A  review  in  2006  estimated  the  potential  revenue  losses  from  various \nincentives and provided recommendations for streamlining and administering incentives. The \nGovernment is considering these recommendations as part of its planning process to streamline \ninvestment incentives. The Government issued Executive Order (EO) 554, which eliminates the \nfees and charges imposed on export clearances, inspections, permits, certificates, and other \ndocumentation  requirements.  The  elimination  of  fees  and  charges  is  crucially  important  to \nreducing  trade  facilitation  costs  in  exporting  goods,  thereby  increasing  international \ncompetitiveness.  EO  554  will  particularly  benefit  small  exporters  and  ADB  estimates  that \nsavings  for  exporters  could  amount  to  at  least  $40  million  in  2007.  In  August  2006,  the \nGovernment issued EO 557, with established a national task force on reducing red tape. The \ntask force is chaired by a representative from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and is \nresponsible  for  establishing  an  action  plan  for  regulatory  reform.  The  broad  agenda  was \nannounced and discussed at a DTI-organized competitiveness summit in October 2006. The \ntask force will coordinate national efforts to reduce the time it takes to start a business and the \nnumber of permits, the time to obtain them, and the cost required.  \n \n60.  Measures to Improve the Policy Framework for Infrastructure Investments. The \nBOT implementing rules and regulations committee (IRR) revised the rules and regulations to \nimprove the framework for infrastructure investment and lay the groundwork for public\u2013private \npartnerships in infrastructure. One substantial change of the BOT IRR is that project approval \nhas been streamlined. Previously, a project had to undergo two approval stages, which was a \nmajor source of delay: in both stages\u2014project approval and draft contract approval\u2014depending \non the amount, approval would have to be sought from the Investment Coordinating Committee  \nor NEDA Board. There is now only a single pass to expedite project approval. Also, in the new \nBOT IRR, the \u201ccontract re-opener\u201d clause was removed thus eliminating a major source of delay \nin implementation.  The current quality of infrastructure is a concern, and the contractors\u2019 \nperformance evaluation system (CPES) is a system of grading the performance of a constructor \nfor a specific kind of infrastructure project, using a standard criteria. The NEDA infrastructure \ncommittee  has  further  developed  the  CPES  guidelines  (CPES)  to  improve  the  quality  of \ninfrastructure investments, and their timely completion within the budget. The Government has \n                                                 \n29 Commission on Audit. http://www.coa.gov.ph \n ", "  23\nalso begun an assessment of procurement procedures and practices with the view to further \nstrengthen the procurement system in compliance with the 2003 Procurement Law. \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 Core Area 4. Social Inclusion \n61.  Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s goal to improve the access to and quality of \nsocial  services  by  increasing  funding,  improving  governance  in  the  budget  process  and \nprocurement,  engaging  civil  society  in  monitoring  procurement,  and  improving  targeting  of \npoverty reduction programs. The Government\u2019s medium-term objective is to create an efficient, \nequitable  and  affordable  social  assistance  and  protection  system.  Critical  reforms  under \nsubprogram  1  include:  (i)  improving  governance  in  public  expenditure  management  and \nprocurement processes in the health and education sectors; and (ii) improving the poverty-\ntargeting of programs. The government\u2019s reform agenda on governance in the social sectors is \nincluded in the second core area of governance (paras. 52\u201359), which focuses on improving \nsystems for poverty monitoring and targeting to lay the groundwork for improving pro-poor \nprograms in the medium term. The following actions toward achieving these objectives were \ncompleted before Board consideration of subprogram 1: \n \n(i)  NSCB  Resolution  No.  6  (s.  2005)  recognized  and  supported  use  of  the \ncommunity-based monitoring system (CBMS) to strengthen the statistical system \nat the local level. \n(ii)  Resolution  NEDA  Board  Social  Development  Committee  Resolution  No.  3 \n(s2006)  adopted  the  CBMS  to  generate  data  for  the  core  poverty  indicator \ndatabase. \n \nC.  The DPSP Medium-Term Program: Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n \n62.  The development policy letter sets out the Government reform agenda for the next 1\u20132 \nyears, building on the reform momentum of subprogram 1. Triggers for the subprogram 2 are \ndescribed in Appendix 2, Table A2.2. The monitorable milestones for subprogram 2 are listed in \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n1.  Fiscal Sustainability, Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n63.  Reduction in Public Sector Deficits. There are two fiscal policy triggers for the second \nsubprogram.  The  Government  is  committed  to  continue  progress  reducing  the  National \nGovernment deficit toward 1% of GDP in 2007. The Government will maintain the consolidated \npublic sector (CPSD) deficit at 2% in 2006, and on track toward a 1.4% deficit in 2007.  Over the \nmedium term, the Government will continue to initiate reforms to reduce the CPSD deficit to \n0.5% by the end of 2009 and eliminate the National Government deficit by 2009, and reducing \nthe non-financial public sector (NFPS) debt to 65% of GDP by 2009 (baseline 87% in 2005). \nOver the medium term the Government intends to strengthen its debt management policy so it \ncan improve its management of the risk of the existing debt and reduce the vulnerability of the \nbudget. Publication of a paper in 2007 outlining the options for the debt management strategy \nwill be an important milestone action. Another milestone action in support of fiscal consolidation \nis the development of a strategic and performance management framework for three GOCCs. \nThis  framework  would  establish  monitorable  performance  targets  for  the  larger  GOCCs \nconsistent with reducing the CPSD deficit.  \n \n64.  Increase in Tax Revenues in 2007. There is one tax policy trigger for the second \nsubprogram. The Government is committed to increasing tax revenues by up to 0.5% of GDP in \n ", "24    \n \n2007. Over the medium term, the Government is committed to raise tax revenues from 13.0% in \n2005 to 15.5% of GDP by the end of 2009. This will be important for meeting budget deficit \ntargets as well as for mobilizing resources for planned increases in social spending and public \ninvestments.  \n \n65.  Strengthening Tax Administration. Improving taxpayer registration will help to raise \nrevenues and reduce the national government deficit in 2007. Therefore, the trigger for the \nsecond subprogram is to clean, update and expand corporate and business registration in the \nBIR database. Gaining access to accurate and complete data is a priority for BIR, for both \ncollections and taxpayer auditing. Additional milestone actions in support of tax administration \ninclude (i) completing implementation of rules and regulations under the Lateral Attrition Law; (ii) \ncentralizing the database for all tax credit certificates, and (iii) implementing and strengthening \nenforcement of the risk-based audit selection developed at BOC.   \n \n66.  Impact and Outcomes of the DPSP Cluster. By the end of 2009, it is expected that the \nDPSP-supported  program  will  have  further  improved  the  Philippines  macroeconomic \nfundamentals and economic growth rate. Fiscal sustainability will have improved as reflected by \nthe elimination of the national government deficit and reduction of the CPSD deficit to 0.5% of \nGDP by 2009. Public debt will also have fallen, supported by the mobilization of additional tax \nrevenues of between 2% to 2.5% of GDP over this period. It is further anticipated that these \nimproved  macroeconomic  fundamentals  will  result  an  upgrade  of  the  credit  rating  for  the \nPhilippines from BB- or equivalent.   \n \n2.  Strengthening Governance in Public Expenditure  \n67.  Strengthening  Public  Expenditure  Management.  There  are  two  triggers  for  the \nsecond subprogram. The 2008 budget proposal will be underpinned by an MTEF based on an \nimproved budget strategy paper and forward estimates developed with departments. This will \nimpose budget discipline, and ensure that department priorities are fully funded over the 3-year \nbudget cycle. In addition, selected line departments (DepEd, DOH, DPWH, and DA) will submit \n2008 budget proposals to DBM based on a new budget structure. The new budget structure will \ninclude the introduction of standard accounting practices. Over the medium term, there will be \nan increase number of departments with MTEF. \n \n68.  Increase  in  the  Number  of  Departments  Fully  Disclosing  Budget  Details.  To \nimprove transparency, accountability and efficiency in public expenditure, the Government will \nput in place systems to ensure greater public disclosure of procurement transactions in selected \ndepartments in 2007. There will be three policy triggers for the second subprogram. First, \ndetailed budget data on allotments and quarterly cash releases by central offices of DOH, \nDPWH, DepEd and DA will be disclosed ex post every quarter on the DBM website. Second, \ndetailed data on payments to contractors for central offices and four pilot regions of DOH, \nDPWH, DepEd, and DA will be disclosed ex post every quarter on the  DBM website. Third all \npublicly bidded opportunities and bid awards of central offices of all government procurement \npolicy board (GPPB) member departments (altogether 12 departments) posted on PhilGEPS in \ncompliance with the Procurement Reform ACT RA 9184. These measures will enable DBM and \nstakeholders to track and match the DBM budget releases with corresponding departmental \nspending allocations and obligations. Over the medium term, the Government will expand the \nnumber of agencies with systems that disclose full budget details  \n \n 69.  Impact and Outcomes of the DPSP Cluster. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported \nprogram is expected to have improved the budget allocation of resources and efficiency through \n ", "  25\nstrengthened institutional and reporting frameworks by linking the medium-term development \nplan and/or priorities of national departments with the budget process (via the MTEF). This will  \nimprove performance management and the delivery of public services, and lead to greater \ntransparency, accountability and monitoring of public procurement. More departments will have \nan MTEF, and completed OPIF. All publicly bidded opportunities and awards of central offices of \n23 national departments will be posted on the PhilGEPS. The anticorruption revenue programs \nwill help to increase the number of tax returns.  \n \n3.  Investment Climate and Infrastructure \n70.  Reduction  in  the  Number  of  Regulations  Governing  Business  Start-ups  and \nOperations. There is one trigger for the second subprogram. The anti-red tape task force will \nprepare a medium-term strategy for business regulatory reform aimed at reducing regulations \naffecting  business  start-ups  and  operations.  Two  supporting  milestone  actions  will  be  (i) \npublication by the DTI of a handbook on best practice in business registration at the local \ngovernment unit level, and (ii) improvements to the administration of investment incentives, \nincluding streamlining the number of administering agencies. These will reduce transaction \ncosts for business, improve competitiveness, and increase investment.  \n \n71.  Better Coordination of Public Infrastructure Projects. The trigger for subprogram 2: \nThe NEDA Infrastructure Committee will issue a priority investment list to DBM by the start of \n2008 budget preparation.  \n \n72.  More Public\u2013Private Participation. Over the medium term, further progress will be \nmade to improve the policy framework for infrastructure investment, including more private \nsector participation. A clear framework for public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) will be developed, \nincluding  procedures  and  institutional  jurisdiction  relating  to  use  of  Government  credit \nenhancements and financial participation, developing the concept, and framing the structure for \na dedicated unit to plan and monitor PPP projects in compliance with the PPP framework. In \naddition, the Government will formulate an inter-modal transport strategy.  \n \n73.  Impact and Outcomes of the DPSP Cluster. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported \nprogram is expected to have further improved the Philippine investment climate. It is anticipated \nthat the investment to GDP ratio will have increased from 15% (2005) to 17-19% of GDP by \n2009 and that the share of public investment in GDP will have increased by 1-2 percentage \npoints. This progress will be achieved by reducing the transaction costs of doing business (as \nreflected in the reduction in the number of days to start up a business), eliminating all export \nfees and charges, and increasing private participation in infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Social Inclusion \n74.  There are no social sector policy triggers for the second subprogram. However, there \nare  three  milestone  actions  that  will  lay  the  groundwork  for  the  third  subprogram:  (i)  the \nGovernment will continue to advocate the adoption of the CBMS and other tools in LGUs (the \ntarget is for 50% of LGUs to be using the CBMS by the end of 2009); (ii) the Government will \nundertake an impact assessment of the Self-Employment Assistance\u2013Kaunlaran program and \nthe Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan\u2013Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services \nprogram, with a view to improving their effectiveness and targeting, and (iii) the Government will \nconduct surveys of basic education to facilitate literacy mapping and school mapping, and to \nprioritize  school-based  management,  with  a  view  to  improving  teacher\u2013student  ratios  and \n ", "26    \n \nclassroom\u2013student  ratios,  identifying  priority  areas  for  health  and  nutrition  programs,  and \ntargeting beneficiaries through an education voucher system.  \n \n75.  Social  Welfare  Strategy.  The  Government  plans  to  develop  a  social  welfare  and \nprotection  reform  strategy  during  the  period  of  the  DPSP.  A  medium-term  expenditure \nframework is being developed for social welfare, protection and development directed at the \npoverty reduction targets of the MDGs and the MTPDP, and improving social services for \nvulnerable sectors of the population. In addition, the DPSP will support the formulation of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to improve delivery of public services with a focus on continuing to \nprioritize implementation of health sector reforms and basic education, and for developing a \nsocial protection framework to enhance and complement the impact of economic growth on \npoverty reduction.        \n \n76.  Impact and Outcomes of the DPSP Cluster. By the end of 2009, the DPSP-supported \nprogram will have improved systems for poverty monitoring and targeting. About 50% of LGUs \nwill have adopted the CBMS, and Government targets for elementary and high school survival \nrates, and child immunization coverage will have been met. In addition, the implementation of \nthe MTEF for education and health sectors, as well as improved procurement procedures will \nincrease  allocations,  and  improved  budget  management  will  prepare  the  ground  for  more \navailability of resources as a result of fiscal consolidation.  \n \nD.  Important Features \n \n77.  The DPSP cluster has a number of distinct and innovative features. First, the Philippines \nhas demonstrated its strong ownership by coordinating all the principal development partners in \nformulating  a  consistent  and  well-sequenced  policy  framework  for  fiscal  and  cross-cutting \nstructural reforms over the medium term. The program is consistent with the Paris Declaration \non Harmonization and Alignment. The development partners\u2019 strategies and approaches have \nbeen aligned with the Government\u2019s MTPDP for 2004\u20132010 and with the PDF.  \n \n78.  Second, the fiscal and cross-cutting policy framework, including the full implementation \nof the MTEF, coordinates well with the ADB\u2019s sector reform programs, which are designed to \nbroaden and deepen the DPSP (e.g., the Health Sector Development Program,30 Financial \nMarket  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program, 31  and  the  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram).32 Although these programs are not part of the policy actions in the DPSP, they \nsupport its scope and objectives and ensure that there is regular policy dialogue.   \n \n79.  Third, the DPSP cluster is a particularly appropriate instrument for strengthening ADB\u2019s \npartnership  with  the  Government  and  enhancing  relations  with  other  constituencies  in  the \nPhilippines. Traditional structural adjustment lending in the Philippines has had a poor record of \nsuccess  in  recent  years  and  has  damaged  the  reputations  of  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners. The DPSP provides a unique opportunity for the development partners to \nengage with the Government in a more innovative way. By basing financial assistance on \ncompleted actions derived from the Government\u2019s own reform program, the DPSP offers a new \n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n \n ", "  27\nway to strengthen the Government\u2019s ownership of the strategies of its development partners. By \nincluding policy triggers and milestone actions for subprogram 2, it creates a vehicle for broad-\nbased policy dialogue and donor support for the Government\u2019s agenda. In addition, the DPSP \nemphasizes  institutionalizing  procedures,  processes  and  programs  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation, rather than focusing merely on conditions that often do not yield any clear \nresults  on  the  ground.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  DPSP  is  clear  from  pubic \nstatements of policy as well as from the development policy letter in Appendix 2.  \n \n80.  Fourth, the DPSP has helped establish an institutional mechanism to achieve better \ninterministerial and interagency coordination and implementation of reforms. An example is \nstrengthening  of  institutional  coordination  between  NEDA,  DOF,  and  DBM  to  simplify  and \nimprove coordination of the design and implementation of the infrastructure investment policy \nframework, as well as to accelerate procurement reforms.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n81.  The Government has requested a loan of $250,000,000 to finance subprogram 1 of the \nDPSP, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB's LIBOR-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board. The Government has made its own \nindependent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an \nundertaking that this choice was not made on the basis of any advice from ADB. \n \n82.  The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 2, Table A2.1). The loan size was determined by the strength of the \npolicy  package,  its  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  and  the \ndevelopment financing needs of the Government, as estimated by the DOF. The political costs \ninvolved in implementing the reforms are considerable. The eventual economic benefits will \ngreatly outweigh the costs, but the costs dominate in the short term. At present, vested interests \nbenefit  from  weak  governance  in the  revenue-collecting agencies  and  in the  selected line \nministries  and  there  is  a  risk  that  their  resistance  may  delay  key  reforms.  Delays  in \nimplementing the governance and fiscal reforms could have substantially higher costs for the \neconomy than the adjustment costs, as such delays would hurt fiscal consolidation and the \neconomy. Direct adjustment costs include the following: (i) foregone revenues resulting from the \nelimination of fees and charges on exports, which ADB staff estimates suggest could be as high \nas $40 million annually; (ii) further reductions  in the revenues of the relevant agencies as a \nresult of future reductions in red tape; and (iii) the costs of carrying out improvements to the \npublic financial management systems, including GFMIS, e-NGAS, and of establishing systems \nfor disclosing budget releases and disbursements on the DBM website.  \n \n83.  The program loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table 3). \nWhile the DPSP supports the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce the Government and CPSD \nbudget deficits, the Government\u2019s gross and net financing needs will be significant if it is to \nachieve its target of 7% economic growth by 2009, create 1 million new jobs annually, and raise \nspending on the social sectors. The Government aims to increase development and social \nspending in 2007 and as a result envisages a targeted Government deficit of no less than 1% of \nGDP. Gross and net financing needs are larger than the planned Government deficit, because \nof the amortization of external and domestic debt. According to DOF budget reports, the gross \nfinancing (external and domestic) requirements for 2006 are estimated at P531 billion and for \n2007 at P390 billion. Net financing requirements (after amortization of external and domestic \n ", "28    \n \ndebt) stand at P150 billion in 2006 and are projected at P87 billion for 2007. The Government\u2019s \ndebt management strategy is to diversify its liability portfolio by increasing the weight given to \ndomestic  debt  financing,  lengthening  the  debt  maturity  profile,  and  maximizing  overseas \ndevelopment assistance financing. Based on the Government\u2019s debt strategy for 2007 (the \nexpected disbursement period for subprogram 1) the DOF projects gross external borrowings at \nP131 billion ($2.59 billion). An ADB staff assessment of debt sustainability indicates that the \nGovernment\u2019s debt stock and strategy are sustainable over the medium term provided fiscal \nconsolidation remains on track. The DPSP proposed loan amount of $250 million will help to \nclose the financing gap for 2007.  \n \nTable 3: Government of the Philippines Projected Financing Requirements for 2007 \n \nFinancing Mix in 2007  Proposed amounts in 2007 \n($) \nGross  financing requirements  7.76 billion \nLess amortization  6.03 billion \nNet financing requirement  1.73 billion \n   \nProgrammed gross external borrowings  2.59 billion \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline  886 million \nDPSPa   250 million \nIntegrated coastal development    36 million \nLGU finance reform   300 million \nGovernance and judicial reform  300  million \nOther donor  and commercial borrowingsb                1.67 billion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGU = local government unit \na The World Bank is cofinancing the reform program through its Development Policy Loan  \nb This sum includes the World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan ($250 million) \nSource: DOF and ADB.

The DOF will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation  of  subprogram  1,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. The DOF will set up a \nDPSP coordinating committee (the Committee), chaired by the Under Secretary of the DOF and \ncomprising  officials  from  DOF,  DBM  and  NEDA.  The  committee  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating the implementation and sustaining of the DPSP policy actions with DBM and \nrelevant line agencies involved in supporting the Program (the OMB, DPWH, DOH, DepEd, and \nDA).  The committee will meet quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe Program (see Supplementary Appendix 1 for the division of monitoring responsibilities of the \ncoordinating committee). ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. The \nDOF will be responsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and will report on \nimplementation progress.   \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n85.  The subprogram 1 period is from November 2004 to 31 March 2007. All actions included \nin the policy matrix were implemented between November 2004 and mid-October 2006.  \n \n \n ", "  29\n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n86.  The program loan of $250 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness \n(i.e., all conditions in the subprogram 1 policy matrix in Appendix 2, Table A2.1, must be \nsatisfactory complied with prior to release of the tranche). The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  9)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans,33 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto the Republic of the Philippines as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired, if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of \nPhilippines  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will be made under the simplified \nprocedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n87.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  met  through  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the DPSP loan. The DPSP will enable the \nGovernment to re-orient its public expenditures toward high-priority poverty reduction needs, \nincluding protecting spending on social policy. \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n88.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \nGovernment.  All  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as \namended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime  to  time),  and  the  Loan  Regulations,  were  specifically  brought  to  the  notice  of  the \nGovernment. \n \n89.  A core component of the DPSP cluster focuses on reducing corruption in key national \ngovernment agencies vulnerable to such practices. The DPSP cluster includes reforms to public \nexpenditure  management  through  the  MTEF,  and  measures  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability  in  budget  allocations,  releases  and  disbursements  in  agencies  with  large \nprocurement budgets (e.g., DPWH, DOH, DepED, and DA). These reforms are important to \nenable civil society to monitor budget releases as they will increase the availability of budget \nand disbursement information. The DPSP cluster supports the work of the OMB and DOF in \nreducing corruption in the key revenue-collecting agencies of BIR and BOC through such anti-\ncorruption initiatives as RATE, RATS, and RIPS (para 56). The DPSP cluster supports OMB\u2019s \nIDRs of key national government agencies as a way of identifying weaknesses in national \nGovernment  agencies\u2019  systems  and  procedures  that  may  increase  their  vulnerability  to \n                                                 \n33  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "30    \n \ncorruption. It will also make recommendations to address such weaknesses. In this regard, the \nGovernment  is  receiving  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  its  fiscal  policy  technical \nassistance, a grant from the US Government\u2019s Millennium Challenge Corporation to DOF, and \ntechnical assistance from the European Union (EU) on the OMB\u2019s IDRs. \n \n90.  An assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \nbetter  understand  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for  the \npurpose of this Program. This assessment was based on diagnostic work done in recent years \nincluding the Philippines Public Expenditure, Procurement, and Financial Management Report  \n(PEPFMR) 200334 and the current public expenditure review both led by the World Bank and \nparticipated  in  by  the  ADB,  as  well  as  the  first  stage  of  the  public  expenditure  financial \nassessment (PEFA). The diagnostic assessments carried out under PEFA have identified core \nareas to address with donor support. Discussions with the Government during the formulation of \nthe DPSP on its ongoing governance reforms were also taken into consideration. Based on this \nassessment  the  fiduciary  arrangements  proposed  for  this  Program  are  acceptable \n(Supplementary  Appendix  3).  The  assessment  indicates  that  the  Government  has  made \nprogress  in  improving  systems  related  to  public  expenditure  management,  financial \naccountability  and  procurement,  although  weaknesses  remain  and  continued  progress  on \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption  is \nessential.  The  Government  places  significant  emphasis  on  strengthening  internal  control \nsystems and overall public financial management through implementing the MTEF, OPIF, as \nwell as other transparency measures. In addition, COA has introduced the electronic version of \nNational  Government  Accounting  System  (e-NGAS)  and  has  been  successfully  piloted  in \nseveral agencies helping to bring about some standardization in accounting practices. \n \n91.  The last Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) undertaken in 2004 shows \nthat there has been distinct progress in the area of public procurement, as mandated by the \nprocurement  law  and  the  issuance  of  implementing  rules.  An  empowered  Government \nProcurement Policy Board has been established and is now overseeing implementation to make \nsure that transparency, efficiency, and accountability principles of the law are carried out. Bids \nand  awards  Committees  and  supporting  procurement  organizations  in  each  agency  are \nfunctioning, as protest mechanism has been defined, electronic procurement is being developed \nand expanded, and posting of invitation and awards in the website is mandated. Standard \nbidding documents were issued for mandatory use and the Generic Procurement Manuals to \nguide  agencies  were  recently  approved.  Both  of  these  documents  were  harmonized  with \ndevelopment partners [footnote 17].   \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n92.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the Philippine Central Bank (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) to receive \nall loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with \nterms satisfactory to ADB. The DOF will be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well \nas a final report on the progress of subprogram 1 implementation.  \n \n \n                                                 \n34 World Bank. 2003. Philippines Public Expenditure Review, Procurement and Financial Management Report. \nWashington.   \n ", "  31\n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n \n93.  In cooperation with the committee (para. 84) and other donor partners, ADB will carry \nout periodic reviews of progress implementation, and assess the impact of the DPSP. The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for DPSP implementation, and will provide ADB \nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with \nthe  committee,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program  performance  6 months  after  loan \neffectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 1 and begin preparation of subprogram 2. In \naddition  to  the  review  report  mentioned,  the  committee  will  submit  within  30  days  of  the \nsubprogram 1 review by the ADB, a report that will evaluate implementation of the policy reform \nmeasures  under  subprogram  1,  and  assess  the  impact  on  each  sector,  describe  lessons \nidentified  during  the  program  period,  and  outline  reforms  and  assistance  needed  for \ndevelopment of the sector, to enable processing of subprogram 2. In addition, participants in the \nPhilippine  Development  Forum  (partner  agencies,  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be \nencouraged to support civil society monitoring of the reforms under the DPSP.   \n \n94.  The Government and its development partners have agreed on a range of outcome and \noutput indicators to monitor the DPSP implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall \nDPSP framework (Appendix 1).  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n95.  The proposed advisory technical assistance (TA) will support NEDA, DOF, and DTI to \nimplement  and  monitor  key  policy  reforms,  and  in  particular  to  broaden  and  deepen  the \ninvestment policy reform agenda during the DPSP period. Under component 1, it will carry out a \nprovincial competitiveness survey of businesses and construct a provincial competitiveness \nindex  to  help  the  Government  to  monitor  the  impact  of  reforms,  identify  emerging  issues \naffecting the investment climate, and track progress in economic governance in the provinces. \nUnder component 2, it will strengthen analytical support for the Government\u2019s efforts to facilitate \nprivate sector development in the services sector, with a focus on emerging growth sectors in \nthe domestic distribution sector. Under component 3, it will support efforts by NEDA, DTI, and \nDOF to improve competitiveness through efficient trade and investment policy frameworks.  \n \n96.   The TA is estimated to cost a total of $1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF).  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $350,000  equivalent  by  providing \ncounterpart  staff  and  other  facilities.  A  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will \nimplement the TA activities. A consulting firm or firms will be engaged by ADB to implement \nComponents 1 and 2, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using \nsimplified technical proposals under quality- and cost-based selection. A team of international \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis to implement activities under component 3, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the competitive selection \nmethod.  A total of 50 (19 international and 31 national) person-months will be required. The TA \npurpose, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, and budget are in Appendix 7, \nand the terms of reference of consultants are in Supplementary Appendix 4. \n \n ", "32    \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n97.  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are: \n \n(i)  progress toward fiscal consolidation, which will help restore confidence in the \neconomy, promote macroeconomic stability, and foster broad-based economic \ngrowth, job creation and poverty reduction, all of which are cornerstones of the \nGovernment\u2019s MTPDP and PDF; \n(ii)  an  increase  in  tax  revenues  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  which  will  provide \nadditional resources for spending on the social sectors and will therefore have a \ndirect positive impact on the poor; \n(iii)  better  governance  in  public  expenditure  management,  including  the \nimplementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  and  procurement \nreforms, and anticorruption revenue initiatives, which will help reduce wasteful \nspending and allow the Government to re-orient expenditure to productive uses \nand social policy; \n(iv)  lower transaction costs for business because of the reduction in red tape and \nelimination of all export fees and charges,  which will open new opportunities, \nincrease investment and productivity, boost the economy, increase incomes and \ncreate jobs; and   \n(v)  higher infrastructure spending, which will generate long-term growth, stimulate \ninvestment, create jobs, and raise incomes.  \n \n98.  Institutional.  The  DPSP  will  contribute  to  significant  institutional  development.  The \nMTEF will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity and reporting framework for effective public \nfinancial management. The implementation of the IDRs and the DOF\u2019s anticorruption revenue \ninitiatives in the BIR and BOC will help to institutionalize effective anticorruption programs within \nthe public sector. The publishing of the budget releases of selected agencies will improve \ntransparency and accountability in public expenditure programs. In the infrastructure sector, the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  framework  for  public\u2013private  participation  will  improve  private  sector \nconfidence in investing in public infrastructure projects.   \n \n99.  Social. The DPSP\u2019s will make several contributions to the social sector. First, it will \nreduce wasteful spending, and support Government measures to align its resources with its \nmedium-term objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. Second, through fiscal \nconsolidation, additional resources will be made available for increased spending on productive \nsocial policy. Third, the DPSP will help improve the governance structure in key social sector \nagencies (e.g., the DepEd and the DOH) thereby preparing the ground for more availability of \nresources as a result of fiscal consolidation. Appendix 5 presents a summary poverty reduction \nand social impact mitigation strategy. \n \n100.  Economic.  The  nature  of  the  DPSP  does  not  allow  for  quantitative  financial  and \neconomic analysis of the impact of the policy reforms on the economy. However, significant \ngeneral economic benefits will accrue to the entire population from the policy initiatives under \nthe four core areas of the DPSP. Fiscal consolidation will stabilize the economy and encourage \nnew investments to occur. An improved fiscal situation will increase the resources for productive \nsocial  spending  and  public  infrastructure.  Improvements  in  the  investment  climate  and \ninfrastructure  policy  framework  will  reduce  transaction  costs  and  uncertainty  to  the  private \nsector and encourage economic growth and improvements in productivity.  \n ", "  33\n101.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. The DPSP will cause no direct \nor indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues affecting indigenous peoples. \nBased on a desk review, the measures supported under the DPSP are unlikely to have any \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n102.  The DPSP is subject to the following risks. \n  \n(i)  Political  instability  could  have  an  impact  on  the  pace  of  reform  and \nmacroeconomic  performance.  However,  although  there  were  considerable \npolitical  disturbances  during  2005,  which  had  an  impact  on  spreads  on \ninternational bonds, the reforms moved ahead, albeit with a delay.  \n \n(ii)  The  elections  for  Congress  in  2007  will  not  affect  policy  actions  under \nsubprogram 1 as they had been accomplished by mid-October 2006. However, \nthe elections may delay legislative reforms and slow the reform momentum in \n2007 if there are personnel changes at the senior level in the executing and \nimplementing agencies. However, many of the triggers for subprogram 2 involve \nimplementing legislative reforms or issuing executive orders in 2006 and thus the \nrisk to the overall reform agenda is relatively low. The Government remains \ncommitted to closely monitoring the economic impact of the reforms adopted \nunder the DPSP, with support from ADB and the other development partners.  \n \n(iii)  The external environment may deteriorate if persistently high oil prices result in a \nslowdown  in  world  economic  growth  and  trade,  and  create  unfavorable \nconditions in world financial markets. This would translate into slower growth in \nthe Philippines and increase fiscal stress. However, to a certain extent, this may \nbe mitigated by the Government\u2019s policy reform package, which includes tax \nreforms and reduction of wasteful public spending through rationalization. The \nPhilippines continues to show a high resilience to oil price shocks. \n  \n(iv)  The Government may lack commitment to implement reforms, and there may be \nweak coordination among government agencies. However, the Government has \nfull  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform  program,  which  is  embedded  in  the \nPhilippines  Development  Forum.  The  Government  has  taken  a  clear  policy \nstance on the need for rapid policy adjustment on the domestic front following the \nfiscal and macroeconomic instability of 2002\u20132004.   \n \n(v)  The capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained by resources \nand other emerging priorities during elections in 2007. However, many donors \nare supporting the reforms through technical assistance.  \n \n(vi)  There will be resistance to the reforms from vested interests. Institutionalizing \ngovernance reforms in the BIR, BOC, and selected line ministries is likely to be a \nlong drawn-out process. There have been disappointing outcomes in recent high- \nprofile corruption cases. However, several factors mitigate these risks. First, the \nDPSP strategic approach is to focus efforts on supporting the Government\u2019s \ninitiatives (a) to improve integrity in revenue collection in the BIR and BOC and \n(b) to strengthen public expenditure management in four national agencies with \nsignificant procurement budgets for infrastructure and the social sectors (the \n ", "34    \n \nDPWH, DepEd, DOH, and the DA). Second, reforms will focus on areas where \nthere is political will and some measure of capacity. The target agencies have \nagreed  to  undertake  significant  performance-based  initiatives  to  improve \ngovernance and reduce corruption. Third, and most importantly, the DOF and \nOMB\u2019s reform programs have traction and strong technical support from key \ndonors such as United States Agency for International Development (USAID),  \nwhich is supporting reforms at the BIR and BOC; the EU, which is support the \nOBM; AusAID, which is working with the Commission of Audit; and the World \nBank, which is providing assistance to DOF and DBM on tax administration and \nexpenditure management.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n103.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP loan agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the DPSP and subsequently. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n104.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the program cluster in an aggregate amount not exceeding $750,000,000 to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support Program; \n \n(ii)  the loan of $250,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe Development Policy Support Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n \n11 January 2007 \n ", "      Appendix 1        35                 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \n(i).

The sector analysis provides a summary assessment of the fiscal policy, governance \nindicators and performance, and social inclusion.  \n \nA.   Fiscal Sustainability  \n \n2.  This section assesses fiscal policy reforms to date and summarizes the discussion of the \nkey medium-term fiscal policy issues. While much has been done to put fiscal policy on a sound \npath, two critical issues face the Government over the medium term: priority spending must be \nallowed to grow, and further reforms must be built on these recent fiscal gains and fiscal \nsustainability ensured in the medium term. We conclude that sustainable adjustment will require \nmore efforts to raise revenues over the next few years, rebalance expenditure away from \nstatutory  outlays  to  spending  on  infrastructure  and  social  sectors,  and  strengthen  debt \nmanagement systems. The Government has outlined a fiscal consolidation strategy supported \nby the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP).    \n \n1.   Background to the Fiscal Problem  \n \n3.  After improving in the first half of the 1990s, the Philippines\u2019 fiscal fortunes quickly \nreversed following the Asian crisis. In the mid-1990s, budget revenues increased markedly and \nnon-financial public sector (NFPS) budget was almost balanced, and public debt on a clearly \ndeclining path. Fiscal reforms in the late 1980s to the mid-1990s\u2014including the introduction of \nvalue added tax (VAT) in 1988\u2014helped improve fiscal sustainability in the mid-1990s. Then \ncame the Asian crisis and, exacerbated by domestic political instability, tax revenues plunged, \nthe NFPS deficit increased sharply, and public debt began to climb. \n \n  Figure A4.1:  NFPS Deficit and Debt as Share of GDP \n \n \n6 NFPS deficit 110\n \n5\n100\n \n4\n  90\n3\n  NFPS debt 80\n2\n \n70\n1\n \n  0 60\n  1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005\n \n \n  Source: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance. \n \n4.  The first fiscal reform was started under the administration of President Corazon Aquino \nin  1986  and  included  the  introduction  of  the  VAT  in  1988,  which  replaced  a  multi-rate \nmanufacturers\u2019  tax,  and  changes  in  individual  and  corporate  income  tax.  The  VAT  was \nexpanded in 1994 to include services that were previously subject to percentage taxes, and the \nthe comprehensive tax reform package (CTRP) was introduced in 1997. Under the CTRP, ad \nvalorem taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages were replaced with specific excises, \nand the taxation of petroleum products was revamped by substantially reducing import tariffs \nand introducing excises. Despite trade liberalization and the resulting reduction in customs \nimport duties, the tax reforms helped increase the national Government tax ratio by almost 3 \npercentage points of GDP from 1990 to 1997. \n ", "Appendix 4  57\n5.  However, the revenue gains from these reforms were not sustained. Figure 3 shows that \nnational Government tax revenues declined by over 4 percentage points of GDP from 1997 to \n2004. About one third of the decline resulted from the continuing trade liberalization and another \nthird from lower excise taxes that were not indexed to inflation. The remainder of the decline can \nbe attributed to lower income tax collection (1.0% of GDP) and weaker indirect taxes, including \nVAT (0.5% of GDP).   \n \n6.  Three factors contributed to the deterioration in the fiscal balance after 1997. First, the \nfinancial  positions  of  the  large  government  owned  and  controlled  corporations  (GOCCs) \ndeteriorated. A substantial proportion of GOCC losses emanated from the National Power \nCorporation (NPC). Some of this decline came as a result of unfavorable contracts between the \nNPC  and  independent  power  producers.  However,  the  primary  factor  explaining  the \ndeterioration in NPC\u2019s revenues was the Government\u2019s decision to cap increases in electricity \ntariffs and a number of subsequent pro-consumer tariff decisions. Consequently, GOCCs losses \nin the NFPS budget amounted to 1.5% of GDP in 2003 and 1.8% in 2004. \n \n7.  A second factor is that budget allocations are biased toward statutory outlays\u2014including \ngovernment wages, transfers to local government units and interest payments\u2014over spending \non  infrastructure  and  maintenance.  The  statutory  expenditure  outlays  in  total  Government \nexpenditure went up by over 11 percentage points to 75% in 2005 over the 1990 level (Chart \nA4.1). This marked change in expenditure composition led to a less flexible budget, which has \nlimited  discretionary  expenditure  policy  over  the  past  few  years  to  cuts  in  capital  and \nmaintenance spending as well as spending in education and health sectors. \n \nChart A4.1: Composition of Government Expenditure\u2014Shift Away from Infrastructure \nand Maintenance  \n \n1990 2005\nOther, 6 Other, 2.8\nCapital  Capital \nspending,  spending, \n14.3 13.3\nLGU  Interest, 33.2 LGU  Interest, 32.0\ntransfers,  transfers, \n3.4 12.7\nMaintenance,  Maintenance, \n14.1 8.8\nPersonnel,  Personnel, \n29 30.4\n                  \nSource: Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing, Republic of the Philippines, various years. \n \n8.  A third factor contributing to the deterioration of the fiscal balance was that the revenues \nthat  boosted  tax  revenues  in  the  1990s  were  undermined  because  (i)  important  sectors, \nincluding  energy,  were  exempted  from  VAT;  (ii)  the  income  tax  base  was  eroded  by  a \nproliferation of tax incentives in new growth sectors of the economy; (iii) specific excises were \nnot  indexed  to  inflation;  and  (iv)  tax  administration  weaknesses  persisted  and  were  not \naddressed, including updating and modernizing the taxpayer registry and addressing corruption \nin the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BOC).  \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 4 \n2.   Fiscal Reform Program \n \n9.  Since 2004, the Government has made important progress in solving the fiscal problem. \nIt has launched a comprehensive fiscal reform program. The program\u2019s cornerstone and the \nmeasure with the highest revenue impact is the VAT reform in November 2005, which extends \nthe VAT base to energy products, and an increase in the VAT rate from 10% to 12% effective in \nFebruary 2006. Other measures supporting fiscal consolidating included raising excise taxes on \nalcohol and tobacco products by 30% at the end of 2004 (although not fully indexed to inflation), \nand increasing the corporate income tax rate from 32% to 35%. The Government is also actively \npursuing a rationalization program to reduce wasteful spending and improve public service \ndelivery. Finally, progress has been made in reducing the deficits of large GOCCs, including \nincreasing electricity tariffs\u2014a measure that has reversed National Power Corporation\u2019s deficit \nto a positive net income position of P86 billion (about $1.7 billion) in 2005.  \n \nTable A4.1: Tax Revenue Performance in 2006 over 2005 \n(peso, in millions, first 11 months of 2006 over 2005) \n \nChange  in  tax \nItem  2005  2006  collection  % change \nTotal tax revenue  446,956  532,817  85,860  19.2 \nI.

Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved following the introduction of these reforms. \nTables A4.1 and A4.2 present key fiscal indicators to show the progress that has been made to \nimprove fiscal consolidation since 2004. Revenues have performed strongly in 2006 to date. \nTax revenues grew by 19% through to November year on year, with VAT revenues growing by \n64%.1 Tax revenues looked set to rise by more than 1 percentage point of GDP in 2006, the first \nincrease of any significance in a decade.  As a consequence of these reforms, the NFPS deficit \nwas cut in half from 5.0% of GDP in 2004 to 2.1% in 2005 and is expected to fall further to 1.8% \nof GDP, aided by the greater-than-expected decline in the Government deficit\u2014estimated at \n1.8% of GDP in 2006, well below its programmed target deficit of 2.1%.   \n \nTable A4.2: Philippines\u2014Key Fiscal Policy Indicators \n(% of GDP) \n \n Indicator  2003  2004  2005  2006 (est) \nNonfinancial sector public deficit  (5.6)  (5)  (2.1)  (1.8) \n - National government budget deficit (DOF definition)  (4.6)  (3.8)  (2.7)  (1.8) \n - National government budget deficit (IMF definition)  (4.9)  (4.2)  (3.0)  (2.1) \n  -GOCCs   (1.5)  (1.8)  (0.4)  (0.8) \n  -SSI  0.4  0.5  0.9  0.8 \n  -LGUs  0.4  0.3  0.4  0.1 \n  -Other  0.1  0.1  0  0.2 \n         \n                                                 \n1  The Department of Finance estimates that about 48% of the additional VAT revenue in 2006 was caused by the \nincreased rate, from 10% to 12%, and that 33% is caused by expanding the tax base.

Considerable fiscal gains have already been achieved following the introduction of these \nreforms, but it will be important to lock in and build up on these gains. The Government has \noutlined a medium-term goal to eliminate both the national government and public sector deficits \nby 2008. The adjustment must be sustainable. This will require continuing to raise tax revenues \nand not suppressing spending on infrastructure and social sectors.  \n \n12.  Issue 1: Priority spending should be allowed to grow. Much of the brunt of the tight \nfiscal policy since 2004 has been suppressed spending on primary expenditure, particularly on \nsocial sectors and infrastructure (Table A4.2). For example, the 2.0 percentage point reduction \nin national Government budget deficit from 2003 to 2005 comprised 1.4 percentage points from \nexpenditure reduction and only 0.6 percentage point from increased tax revenue. In 2006, \nhowever, tax revenues played a bigger role in deficit reduction than in the past: the estimated \ndeficit  reduction  of  1.0  percentage  point  comprises  a  0.2  percentage  point  reduction  in \nexpenditures and 0.9% increase in tax revenues. Moreover, the Government of the Philippines \nspends less on the social sectors compared to many of its regional neighbors. At about 2.9% of \nGNP, the Philippines spends much less on education than in Malaysia (8.7% of GNP), Thailand \n(4.7% of GNP), and India (4.1%), but higher than in Indonesia (1.3%).2 \n \n13.  The Government intended to channel 30% of additional VAT revenues (estimated at P30 \nbillion) to infrastructure and social sectors (education and health) in 2006, and initially targeted a \n17% increase in primary spending in the 2006 budget. The impasse over the 2006 budget \nresulted  in  a  reenactment  of  the  2005  budget,  and  Congress  recently  approved  a \nsupplementary budget of P46 billion (0.8 % of GDP). The Government has reported that it is \nspending less than programmed in these areas as a result of the reenactment of the 2005 \nbudget.  With  the-better-than  expected  reduction  in  its  budget,  the  Government  intends  to \naccelerate  spending  on  priority  sectors  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2006.  However,  national \n                                                 \n2  United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. 2006. Education for All Global Monitoring Report. \nParis.  Available: http://www.unesco.org/education/ \n \n ", "60  Appendix 4 \nGovernment spending is expected to fall short of program by about 0.5% of GDP in 2006 \nbecause of lags in disbursements (Table A4.2). Part of the shortfall will be recovered in the \n2007 budget. Congress recently approved the national Government budget for 2007, which \ntargets an increase in expenditure on the social sectors by about P30 billion (or 12%) and \nnational Government infrastructure by P11 billion (16%) over the adjusted budget for 2006, \nmeaning that the increase over actual spending in 2006 will be much larger. The Government\u2019s \nmedium-term goal is to raise public investment by as much as 1.5 percentage points of GDP by \n2009.  \n \n14.  Issue  2:  Over  the  medium-term,  sustainable  fiscal  consolidation  will  require \nfurther  revenue  effort.  While  the  VAT  reform  marks  an  important  advance  in  this  area, \ninternational comparison suggests that there is much upside potential to improving revenue \nperformance.  Alternative  medium-term  outlooks  for  fiscal  policy  are  in  Table  A4.4,  which \npresents two scenarios based on assumptions about further fiscal policy reforms. Scenario one \nassumes no additional reforms in 2007 over current measures up to 2006, and includes the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term objective of increasing in capital outlays. The second assumes \nadditional reforms (rationalization of investment incentives and tax administration). The first \nscenario shows a marked slowdown in progress toward fiscal sustainability compared with 2006, \nwith a persistent NFPS deficit of 2% of GDP and a slower reduction in pubic debt. Implementing \nfurther reforms in 2007 would accelerate the shift toward fiscal sustainability and accomplish the \nGovernment\u2019s targets of a near-balanced public sector budget by 2008/09, with public debt \nfalling to 60\u201365% of GDP. While the scenarios are indicative, they demonstrate the need for \ncontinuing fiscal reforms.  \n \nTable A4.3: Regional Comparison\u2014Tax Revenues as Share of GDP \n \nYear  Philippines  Indonesia  Malaysia  Sri Lanka  Thailand \n2000  13.7  \u2014  14.3  14.5  14.5 \n2001  13.5  13.2  18.8  14.6  14.9 \n2002  12.5  \u2014  18.8  14.0  15.6 \n2003  12.4  12.8  17.6  13.2  16.7 \n2004  12.3  13.0  \u2014  13.9  \u2014 \n2005  13.0  13.4  \u2014  15.4  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available \nSource: IMF statistical appendix. \n \n15.  Issue  3:  Medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  requires  rebalancing  expenditure \ncomposition away from statutory outlays to ensure adequate financing of infrastructure and \nsocial sectors. Increased public investment will improve fiscal sustainability by raising potential \neconomic growth and therefore the tax take. \n \n16.  Issue  4:  Debt  management  policy  needs  strengthening  to  ensure  debt \nsustainability  over  the  long  term,  including  addressing  contingent  liabilities.  Some \nprogress has been made in debt management in recent years, particularly in lengthening the \naverage maturity of Government debt and in maintaining a diverse portfolio of obligations. \nHowever, more progress is needed to reduce the vulnerability of the budget and economy to \nmacroeconomic  fluctuations.  The  growing  stock  of  debt  outside  the  Government\u2019s  own \nborrowing program, such as GOCC and government financial institution debt, and the challenge \nof accurately quantifying and assessing the level of contingent liabilities, as well as assets of \nGOCCs, add to the risks. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  61\n17.  The Government has outlined a strategy to support a sustainable adjustment in fiscal \npolicy over the next few years supported by the DPSP:  \n(i)  Continue to implement reforms to enhance the revenue system by broadening \nthe  tax  base  by  rationalizing  income  tax  incentives.  The  tax  incentives \nrationalization bill is pending in Congress. In the meantime, the Government \nintends to streamline the administration of incentives in 2007.  \n(ii)  Strengthen tax administration, including by improving taxpayer registration, audit \nstrategies, and debt collection techniques. \n(iii)  The Government\u2019s decision to spend a share of incremental revenues from the \n  reformed VAT on infrastructure and social sectors is a step in the right direction. \n(iv)  Introduce performance contracts in large GOCCs that would pave the way for \n  monitorable targets.  \n(v)   Strengthen debt management systems to bring them in line with international \n  best practice. \n(vi)  Continue to implement a rolling 3-year medium-term expenditure framework. \n \nTable A4.4: Philippines Medium-Term Outlook, 2006\u20132009 \n \n Indicator    No-further-reforms scenario  Additional-reforms scenario \n  2006 (est)  2007  2008  2009  2007  2008  2009 \nNonfinancial sector public deficit  (1.8)  (2.3)  (2.2)  (2.2)  (1.4)  (0.4)  (0.1) \n - National Government budget     \ndeficit (DOF definition)  (1.8)  (1.9)  (1.9)  (2.0)  (1.3)  (0.5)  (0.3) \n               \nRevenues and grants   22.8  22.4  22.3  22.0  22.8  23.3  23.6 \nExpenditure (primary)   18.5  19.0  19.2  19.1  19.0  19.2  19.5 \nInterest  6.0  5.6  5.3  5.2  5.1  4.6  4.2 \n               \nMemorandum item               \n-Nonfinancial sector public debt  79  73  70  67  71  66  63 \n( ) = negative \nSource:  International  Monetary  Fund.  2006.

In September 2006, the World Bank released Governance Matters 2006: Worldwide \nGovernance Indicators, which looks at aggregate and individual country governance indicators \nfor 1996\u20132005 in 213 countries. The indicators measure six dimensions of governance: (i) voice \nand accountability, (ii) political stability and absence of violence, (iii) government effectiveness, \n(iv) regulatory quality, (v) rule of law, and (vi) control of corruption. There is no country-specific \ngovernance assessment of the Philippines, but the report shows that it has been faltering in its \ndrive against corruption over the past 10 years, on the basis of governance indicators that \ndowngrade the country from 121 to 126 place.  \n \n19.  The indicators, nevertheless, show an improvement from the preceding year in most \ncategories. For example, percentile rank in political stability/no violence was 17.5 in 2005 up \nfrom 12.3 in 2004, government effectiveness 55.5 up from 50.2, regulatory quality 52.0 up from \n47.3, and rule of law 38.6 up from 32.7. The country\u2019s percentile rank means that it is better off \nthan 55.5% (e.g., in case of government effectiveness) of the 213 countries. The perception of \ndecreasing gains against corruption is reinforced because the country ranked 50.5% in 1998 in \nthe control of corruption indicator and has slid to 37.4 percent in 2005, though this masks a \nslight improvement over 34.8 in 2004.  \n ", "62  Appendix 4 \n \n20.  Concerns have been raised regarding the data\u2019s objectivity. The study acknowledges the \nlimitations of the measures as the aggregate indicators consist of 276 variables measuring \ndifferent dimensions of governance. The data for such estimations are taken from 31 sources \nproduced  by  25  organizations,  compiled  through  surveys  of  firms,  individuals,  and  other \norganizations. The report did not use the country\u2019s premier pollster, the Social Weather Station, \nas a survey source, which portrays a more positive picture. Any broad cross-country or over-\ntime  comparisons  of  governance  need  to  take  into  account  the  margins  of  error  that  are \nnecessarily associated with perception-based indicators. The margins of error also reflect the \npervasive difficulties of measuring governance, as it is not easy to perfectly capture complex \nconcepts such as corruption, government effectiveness, or voice and accountability. The study \nalso concludes that the aggregate indicators can \u201cbe a rather blunt tool for policy advice at the \ncountry  level\u201d.  This  suggests  that  any  governance  assessment  should  also  factor  in  a \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  program  and  cite  efforts  or  progress  in  achieving  the  stated  good \ngovernance and anticorruption goals. \n \n21.  There is also a flip side to the image presented by these indicators. The recent record \nrevenue collections, declining poverty incidence, and the decreasing number of firms bribing \ngovernment officials show that government efforts to curb corruption are making some headway. \nThe Bureau of Customs and Bureau of Internal Revenue, two of the more corrupt agencies, \nhave posted record revenue collections for this year, which points to improved performance and \nreduced corruption. This has largely been possible with the ongoing anticorruption measures \nand programs of these agencies, such as the revenue integrity protection service (RIPS), run \nafter tax evaders (RATE), and run after smugglers (RATS). A recent survey of the Social \nWeather Station found that the number of companies paying bribes for public contracts has \ngone down from 57 percent in 2003 to 46 percent in 2006. Though the figure is still high, the \nimprovement cannot be overlooked. \n \n22.  The Government has an ongoing governance and anticorruption reform program to \ndevelop government systems and processes to manage public finance, the civil service, and \naccountability. The salient features of this reform program are (i) improving public expenditure \nmanagement by preparing a budget strategy paper, projecting forward estimates, rolling out a \nweb-enabled  e-budget  system  to  increase  transparency  in  budget  releases,  rolling  out  an \nelectronic accounting system to national agencies, designing and implementing the government \nintegrated financial management and information systems (GIFMIS), and strengthening audit \nexecution and follow up; (ii) strengthening performance management and improving public \nservice  delivery  by  adopting  the  organizational  performance  indicator  framework  (OPIF), \nrationalizing the government compensation system, rationalizing government agencies, and \nimplementing other concomitant civil service reforms; (iii) reforming procurement through public \ndisclosure of contract awards and prices by agencies with high procurement volumes; (iv) \npursuing convictions in high-profile cases, quickly resolving corruption cases, strengthening the \nOffice of the Ombudsman, and preparing agency-specific integrity development reviews.  \n \n23.  In  2006,  Sandiganbayan,  the  high  anticorruption  court,  convicted  seven  officials, \nincluding two mayors; 74 officials have been dismissed from service for corruption, including a \ncustoms deputy commissioner and Commission on Election (Comelec) bidding officials. Integrity \ndevelopment  reviews  have  been  completed  for  the  five  \u201chigh-risk\u201d  government  agencies, \nincluding BOC, BIR, Land Transportation Office, Department of Public Works and Highways, \nand Philippine National Police. These reviews promote and strengthen measures the agencies \nto make them more public-friendly and to enhance transparency in their operations.  \n \n ", "Appendix 4  63\n24.  The DPSP is supporting governance priority areas as identified under the Government \nreform program so as to increase the breadth and depth of the Government\u2019s ongoing reforms. \nThe rationale of the DPSP stems from a multi-pronged premise: (i) to further improve overall \ngovernance emerging as a result of the Government\u2019s reform program, (ii) to ensure that \nincreased  government  revenues  are  spent  efficiently  by  improving  public  expenditure \nmanagement  and  procurement,  and  (iii)  to  ensure  that  graft  and  corruption  cases  are \nexpeditiously prosecuted.  \n \n25.  Cross-Country Comparison. The World Bank indicators on control of corruption and \nrule of law rank the Philippines lower than the average of developing and East Asian economies. \nThe same indicators for 2005 have been used to construct a cross-country comparison among \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam \n(Table A4.5).

What conclusions can we draw from the above discussion? First, the data must be \ninterpreted carefully to avoid subjective bias. The data cannot be divested from the ongoing \ncountry reform programs and should be interpreted against the backdrop of any such initiatives \nto get a holistic picture. Second, there can be no denying that the Philippines has significant \ngovernance and corruption problems, but it has also made important progress that should not \nbe overlooked. From a high peak in 1998, the six World Bank indicators deteriorated over the \nnext few years but most are improving. It may well be some time before they regain their 1998 \nlevels, but the process can be accelerated by supporting the Government\u2019s reform efforts. Third, \nthe DPSP recognizes this reality. It not only \u201crewards\u201d the Government\u2019s fiscal performance but \nalso endeavors to strengthen the systems that will help sustain fiscal gains by strengthening \ngovernance in public financial management and procurement. In addition to areas covered \nunder the DPSP, other equally important reforms are needed to strengthen the judiciary and \nbuild capacities in local governance and fiscal management, for which modes of interventions \nmay be identified.  \n \nC.   Social Inclusion \n \n29.  The poverty incidence in the Philippines has declined more rapidly in recent years but \nremains  higher  than  its  regional  neighbors\u2019.  The  Government\u2019s  family  income  expenditure \nsurvey (FIES), conducted every 3 years, estimated that poverty incidence had declined from \n33% in 2000 to 30% in 2003.5  Estimates using a consumption threshold of $2 per day show \npoverty incidence in the Philippines to have declined from 46.7% in 2000 to 41.9% in 2005, \nwhich (comparing 2005 estimates) is less than in Indonesia (44.4%) or Viet Nam (49.1%) but \nhigher than in Thailand (22.8%) or the PRC (28.6%). Its higher incidence and slower decline \nthan other East Asian countries\u2019 reflect the modest per capita growth in the Philippines over the \npast 25 years, weakness in transforming a given rate of per capita income growth into poverty \nreduction (i.e., lower income growth elasticity of poverty than most other Asian developing \ncountries), and problems in the effectiveness and targeting of Government programs for the \npoor. The high regional income and asset inequality blunts the effect of income growth on \npoverty; the estimated income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient is relatively high at \n0.468  for  2003.  Prolonged  conflict  in  parts  of  the  country  has  also  limited  economic \nopportunities and the benefits of growth to the poor. 6  However, GDP growth averaging about \n5.5% and rapid increases in remittances during 2003\u20132006 are expected to more quickly reduce \npoverty in the 2006 FIES.  \n \n30.  The Philippines has made better progress in achieving the MDGs than other regional \neconomies, particularly reducing extreme poverty; child mortality; the incidence of HIV/AIDs, \ntuberculosis and malaria; improving gender equality in education; and improving households\u2019 \ndietary intake as well as access to safe drinking water.

The \nprobability of achieving the MDG and Education for All targets for elementary and high school \ncohort survival is low, and that of increasing elementary participation is medium.  While high \nschool  participation  rates  increased  in  2001/02  from  58%  to  60%  in  2003/04,  elementary \nparticipation  rates  have  fallen  from  97%  in  1999/00  to  88.4%  in  2003/04.  Elementary \nparticipation rates have fallen from 96.95 in 1999/00 to 88.58 in 2003/04. Because of poor \ntransition rates between the two levels of education, few children (38% in 2003) graduate from \nhigh school.  The persistent underperformance of the education system in important skill areas \nfor economic development is illustrated by the comparative data on achievement: in 2003, the \nPhilippines ranked 23rd of 25 countries in the grade-4 mathematics and science tests in the \nTrends in International Mathematics and Science Studies test.  The impact of compressed \nfunding for education has been worsened by rapid population growth: real government spending \nper  student  fell  by  an  average  of  3  percent  per  annum  from  2000  to  2004.    Weak, \novercentralized  governance  and  inequality  in  resource  allocation  have  contributed  to  poor \nschool performance, especially for the rural poor, and are reflected in marked inequality in \nschool achievement. Functional literacy rates varied from 95% to 63% across the 17 regions in \n2003. \n \n32.  The  Philippines  might  not  meet  the  MDG  for  reducing  child  malnutrition,  reducing \nmaternal mortality, and increasing the prevalence of couples practicing responsible parenthood. \nLow health service quality and problems of financial and physical access for the poor lie behind \nthis poor performance.  Catastrophic health care costs and loss of earnings because of ill health \nare a leading cause of chronic poverty.  Public spending on health ($14 per capita per year, for \nnational, local government, and social health insurance spending combined) and total spending \non health ($33 per capita per year and 3.1% of GDP) are low for a country at the Philippines\u2019 \nlevel  of  economic  development,  and  have  remained  static  for  the  past  8  years.    (The \ncomparable figures for lower-middle-income countries average $33.94 for public expenditure on \nhealth, and $81.60 or 5.6% of GDP for total expenditure).  \n ", "66  Appendix 5 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Philippines: The Development Program Loan \n(DPSP) focuses on four policy areas: (i) improved fiscal sustainability, macroeconomic stability, and creditworthiness; \n(ii) improved governance in the public sector; (iii) strengthened investment climate; and (iv) protected social sectors. \nThe DPSP policy areas largely correspond with those of the Government as spelled out in the Medium-Term \nPhilippines Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job \ncreation; (ii) energy dependency and power sector reforms; (iii) social justice and basic needs; (iv) education and \nyouth opportunities; and (v) anticorruption measures and governance. The MTPDP mission is to \u201cfight poverty by \nbuilding prosperity for the greatest number of Filipino people.\u201d The country must open up economic opportunities, \nmaintain sociopolitical stability, and promote good stewardship\u2014all to ensure better quality of life. \n \nThe Government must first solve the fiscal problem if it is to achieve a sustained and accelerated pace of growth. For \nthe second consecutive year, the Government has been improving its tax collection. The VAT reform is producing \nresults, as well as the intensified collection performance by BIR and BOC, through the new governance measures: \nrevenue integrity protection service (RIPS), run after tax evaders (RATE), and run after the smugglers (RATS), \ntogether with implementation of the Lateral Attrition Act, which provides incentives to BIR and BOC officials to collect \ntaxes and duties more efficiently. At the same time, the expenditures through the first semester were less than \nanticipated. The increased revenue will be used to reduce public debt, and to finance infrastructure and social \nservices. In 2007, an additional P6.7 billion will be released for social services, including a school feeding program \n(P1.5 billion), health insurance subsidy (P1.0 billion), hospital assistance (P0.5 billion), and textbooks (P0.5 billion). \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe poverty incidence dropped from the revised estimate1 of 27.5% in 2000 to 24.7% in 2003, as earnings rose across \nall income levels, except among the top 10% of families. The number of families living below the poverty line was \nreduced from 4.183 million in 2000 to 3.966 million in 2003. The country\u2019s annual per capita poverty threshold reached \nP12,267 in 2003, up by 7.1% compared to the revised 2000 level of P11,451. Thus, a family of 5 members should \nhave an income of at least P5,111/month to be able to sustain their minimum basic needs, both food and non-food. \nThe annual per capita food threshold increased by 5.5%, from P7,707 in 2000 to P8,134 in 2003. Subsistence \nincidence, or the proportion of families with per capita income below the food threshold, stood at 10.4% in 2003, \nexhibiting a decrease of almost 2.0% from 12.3% in 2000. In 2003, about 1.664 million families did not earn enough \nincome to provide for their basic food requirements, representing a drop from the 2000 level of 1.850 million families.2 \n \nThe MTPDP contains ambitious poverty reduction targets. The stated goal is to reduce the poverty incidence of \nfamilies from 28.4% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2010. Similarly, the subsistence incidence of families is intended to drop from \n13.1% in 2000 to 8.98% in 2010. This would allow the Philippines to meet the target of halving poverty by 2015, one of \nthe commitments to the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The poverty target assumes a reduction in \npopulation growth rate from 2.34% in 2000 to 2.11% in 2000-2005 and 1.93% in 2005-2010, as well as a significant \nreduction in inequality, indicated by the decline in Gini coefficient from 0.43 in 2000 to 0.35 by 2010. \n \nProgress in achieving the MDGs is mixed. While the probability is high that the Philippines will meet the poverty target, \nas well as the targets on gender equality and child mortality, meeting other targets by 2015 will be more of a \nchallenge. Concerted efforts will be required to meet the targets for universal primary education, maternal health, \nenvironmental sustainability, and combating diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  In 2003, the National Statistical Coordination Board introduced a new set of poverty estimates  \n2  National Statistical Coordinating Board. 2005.

Introduction \n \n1.  To support the implementation of the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP), the \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \nadvisory technical assistance (TA). The objectives of the TA grant are twofold, first, to support \nthe Government (National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Trade and \nIndustry, and Department of Finance in implementing and monitoring the impact of key policy \nreforms and, second, to broaden and deepen the investment and trade policy reform agenda \nunder the DPSP. This requires analytical inputs and institutional capacity building to equip key \nagencies to continue to broaden and deepen the reform agenda. The TA concept clearance was \napproved by C. Lawrence Greenwood Jr. (vice-president operations 2) on 10 November 2006. \nThe scope of the TA therefore parallels the DPSP, covering principally the investment climate \ncomponent  and  impact  and  outcomes  listed  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nB.  Issues \n \n2.   The challenge for the Government is to lift investment rates to create jobs for hundreds \nof thousands of the new job seekers each year and the increasing pool of unemployed. Key to \nhigher economic growth is the private sector, but it is not keeping pace with its neighbors \nbecause  the  investment  climate  is  perceived  as  not  supportive.  Recent  surveys  identify \nweaknesses  in  the  investment  climate  that  are  major  impediments  to  higher  and  more \nsustainable economic growth. Several surveys on business climate perception suggest that, \namong other factors, excessive red tape, remaining distortions in the trade regime, the domestic \ncompetitive environment, taxes, contract enforcement, macroeconomic instability, corruption, \ninadequate  infrastructure  (especially  high  electricity  tariff  rates),  taxes,  economic  policy \nuncertainty,  and  customs  are  some  of  the  major  obstacles  to  private  sector  growth  and \ndevelopment.1 These  impediments  have  combined  to  dampen  both  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestor confidence.  \n \n3.  At the same time, several new growth sectors are generating thousands of new jobs. \nMany  of  the  new  sectors  are  service-based  (e.g.,  information  technology  and  back-office \noperations, modern retail sector and domestic distribution). Services have been the fastest-\ngrowing sector, accounting for about 60% of economic growth since 2000. In recent months, \nseveral stakeholders have emphasized the importance of services in creating jobs and raising \nincomes. Many service sectors are important for their wide links with the rest of the economy. \nFor example, the recent growth in supermarkets has important implications for wholesalers and \nincomes of farmers, as well as potential for exports. Private sector development and growth in \nthese sectors will depend on ensuring an enabling investment climate.  \n \n4.   The TA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s investment reform agenda. Under \nthe DPSP cluster the Government is committed to lowering transaction costs and improving \ncertainty  for  investors  and,  over  the  medium  term,  to  continue  with  reforms  to  improve \ncompetitiveness. The Government has established a task force that will prepare a medium-term \naction plan to reduce red tape and reform business regulation. The preparation of the medium-\nterm  action  plan  is  a  trigger  for  the  second  subprogram.  The  Government  is  preparing  a \nhandbook on best practice in business registration for local governments. This TA complements \n                                                 \n1 See for example, Asian Development Bank and World Bank investment climate survey in  2003\u20132004. \n ", "70  Appendix 7 \nanother ADB TA on developing the Philippine business registry,2 as well as other activities of \nother  development  partners,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID). The World Bank is supporting public\u2013private participation in \ntransport infrastructure. USAID is providing complementary assistance for a range of investment \nissues in infrastructure and regulatory reform under the EMERGE project. ADB has worked \nclosely  with  development  partners  in  preparing  the  TA,  and  will  continue  to  do  so  during \nimplementation to ensure efficient use of resources.   \n \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n5  The  TA  will  support  the  DPSP  cluster  by  (i)  providing  the  Government  with  timely \neconomic policy analysis and advice on investment policy and competitiveness issues, and (ii) \nstrengthening institutional capacity in Government to deepen the investment climate reform \nagenda, to implement the reforms and monitor progress and impact.  \n \n6.  Impacts  of  the  TA  are  an  improved  investment  climate  that  will  reduce  business \ntransaction costs and increase competitiveness, and help increase investment, raise sustained \neconomic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty.   \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The key TA activities are divided into three components:  \n \n(i)  Component 1: Provincial competitiveness survey and index. The provincial \ncompetitiveness  survey  of  businesses  will  help  the  Government  monitor  the \nimpact  of  reforms  and  identify  emerging  issues  by  constructing  a  provincial \ncompetitiveness index (PCI). The PCI will be a national investment indicators \nsurvey of businesses that will track progress in the Government\u2019s economic \ngovernance  agenda  for  improving  the  investment  climate  in  key  areas  of \nbusiness regulatory reform, tax administration, reforms in BOC, and investment \npolicy, among other policy areas. The survey will strengthen the Government\u2019s \ncapacity to monitor and implement reforms and be a tool for identifying emerging \ninvestment policy issues. It will cover most provinces, allowing ADB and the \nGovernment  to  benchmark  economic  governance  across  provinces,  rank \nprovinces\u2019 performance, and identify best provincial practices. The survey will be \ncarried  out  in  2007.  The  output  will  be  a  report  on  the  PCI  and  economic \ngovernance for private sector development. \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Strengthening private sector development and growth in the \ndistribution sector. This component will provide an analytical case study on the \ndevelopment and growth of supermarkets and their supply chains and links with \nfarmers, as well as impact on household spending patterns.  The focus will be on \nbetter  understanding  the  supermarket\u2013farmer  supply  chain  nexus  and \nimplications for public and private programs in facilitating growth of the sector. \nThe supermarket sector has been selected based on recent growth performance, \nlinks to farmers and the rest of the economy, job creation, and poverty.

This  component  will  help  the  Government \ncontinue reforms to improve competitiveness by (i) building on previous work by \nothers, reviewing and assessing remaining trade policy distortions (mainly in \nagriculture), estimating effective rates of protection, and outlining options for \nreforms to improve competitiveness; (ii) providing input to the Government to \ndevelop a strategy and mechanisms to reduce red tape and implement business \nregulatory reforms;  (iii) building on previous work to assess and recommend \nways to reform investment incentives and other fiscal policies consistent with the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal consolidation efforts and private sector development.  \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n9.  NEDA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency;  NEDA,  DBM,  DOF,  and  DTI  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  NEDA  was  selected  because  of  its  multi-functions  of  providing \nGovernment with analytical support, coordinating policy formulation across the key sectors, and \noverseeing tariff policy formulation through the Tariff Commission. NEDA is also a core member \nof  the  Government  DPSP  coordinating  committee  and  responsible  for  coordinating  the \ninvestment climate component of the DPSP. DBM was selected as it is a member of the \nGovernment\u2019s  competitiveness  committee.  DOF  was  selected  as  it  is  consolidating  fiscal \ninvestment incentives. DTI was selected as it chairs the task force on reducing red tape and the \ncompetitiveness committee overseeing the Government\u2019s competitiveness strategy. NEDA will \nprovide  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  services  to  the  consultants,  and  closely \ncoordinate with other stakeholders involved in TA implementation. The TA will commence on or \nabout 1 March 2007 and be completed on or about 30 August 2008, coinciding with the second \nand third subprograms. Procurement of equipment under component A will be done by the \nconsulting firm in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines. Upon completion of the project \nactivities the equipment will be transferred to NEDA. \n \n10.  A team of international and national consultants will implement the TA. A consulting firm \nor firms will be engaged by ADB to implement components 1 and 2, through simplified technical \nproposals using quality- and cost-based selection. For component 3, a team of international \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis to implement activities. Consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total of 50 (19 \ninternational and 31 national) person-months will be required. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services and their duration are in Supplementary Appendix 4.  \n \n11.   The consultants will regularly provide written reports in English: (i) an inception report to \ninclude a comprehensive implementation plan will be submitted within 4 weeks after the TA \nstarts; (ii) an interim report; (iii) progress reports; (iv) a draft final report and, subsequently, a \nfinal report to be submitted before the TA ends. Specific timing and content of the reports will be \ndiscussed with NEDA. The reports will be submitted to NEDA and ADB.  \n \n12.   The  TA  will  produce  a  series  of  demand-driven  policy  reports  to  the  Government, \nstakeholders,  and  other  donors,  which  will  include  policy  reform  recommendations  and \nimplementation  strategies.  The  reports  will  be  used  as  input  into  a  comprehensive  and \nintegrated  trade  and  investment  ADB  report,  Strengthening  Institutions  for  Private  Sector \nGrowth. Outline of the contents will be in Supplementary Appendix 4. The expected outputs will \nbe presented at a workshop launching the results of the first provincial competitiveness index in \nearly 2008.  \n  \n  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070215092809+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070116152601+08'00'", "Title": "Development Policy Support Program", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
