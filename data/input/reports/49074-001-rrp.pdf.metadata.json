Growth  of  manufacturing  is  hence  needed  to  provide  jobs  to  workers  involved  in \nlow-productivity informal economic activities. The textile and garment industry generated export \nearnings of $20 billion, which accounted for 16.6% of gross domestic product of the country in \nFY  2013.2 Bangladesh  is  the  world\u2019s  second-largest  exporter  of  textiles and  garments  and the \nindustry accounted for 83% of its total merchandise exports in FY2014.3 The industry employs \n4.2 million workers, of which nearly 80% are women.  \n \n3. \nAfter  two  major  disasters\u2014the  2012  Tazreen  factory  fire  and  the  2013  Rana  Plaza \nbuilding  collapse\u2014the  Government  of  Bangladesh  signed  the  Bangladesh  Sustainability \nCompact  with  the  European  Union,  the  United  States  (US),  and  the  International  Labour \nOrganization.  The  compact  is  built  on  short-  and  long-term  commitments  related  to  three \ninterlinked pillars: (i) respect for labor rights, (ii) structural integrity of buildings and occupational \nsafety  and  health,  and  (iii)  responsible  business  conduct.  A  recent  study  by  the  European \nCommission found that Bangladesh has made much progress since the launch of the compact \nin  terms  of  labor  rights  protection  and  building  and  workplace  safety  improvement.4 Under  the \nsecond  and  the  third  pillars  of  the  compact,  the  innovative  responsible  business  conduct \ninitiatives  through  the  Accord  on  Fire  and  Building  Safety  in  Bangladesh  and  the  Alliance  for \nBangladesh  Worker  Safety  have  made  a  considerable  positive  difference.  The  accord  is  a  5-\nyear,  independent,  legally  binding  agreement  signed  by  more  than  200  apparel  corporations \nfrom 20 countries, two global trade unions, and numerous Bangladeshi trade unions. It has four \nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  participants  and  the  International  Labour  Organization  as \nthe  independent  chair.  The  alliance  is  a  similar  5-year  initiative  founded  by  a  group  of  North \nAmerican apparel companies and whose members represent the overwhelming majority of the \nNorth  American  importers  of  ready-made  garments  (RMGs)  from  Bangladesh,  produced  at \nmore than 700 factories. Both the accord and the alliance are funded by contributions from their \nmembers.  The  accord  has  an  annual  budget  of  close  to  $10.0  million,  while  the  alliance  had \ncollected revenues of $13.6 million by 30 June 2014. \n \n4. \nUnder the accord and the alliance, qualified consultants have been engaged to carry out \ninspections of RMG factories for fire,  electrical, and structural  safety.  By  April  2015,  under  the \naccord and the alliance all 1,900 factories under their remit had been inspected, which resulted \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Socially sustainable projects include (i) the construction or \nexpansion  of  textile  and  garment  factories  that  meet  the  high  structural,  fire,  and  electrical  safety  standards \nrequired by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh or the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, \nand  (ii)  improvement  of  existing  factories  to  meet  any  of  the  above  standards.  Environmentally  sustainable \nprojects  include  the  construction  of  wastewater  treatment  and  effluent  treatment  plants  in  the  industry  sector, \nprimarily in textiles and garments. \n\n2   ADB. 2014.

Summary  inspection \nreports  are  made  public  in  a  searchable  database,  thus  bringing  more  transparency  to  the \ngarment  supply  chain.  A  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  with  an  implementation  timeline  is \nprescribed based on the findings  of the  initial  inspection,  and for factories  that  need  structural \nchanges  a  detailed  engineering  assessment  has  been  carried  out.  Accord  and  alliance  staff \nwere mobilized to carry out follow-up inspections to monitor the implementation progress of the \nCAPs.5 Under  the  accord  and  alliance,  capacity  building  is  provided  in  the  form  of  health  and \nsafety  trainings  to  workers  and  establishment  of  occupational  safety  and  health  committees \ncomprising worker representatives and management. \n \n5. \nWater pollution by textile and garment factories, tanneries, and paper and pulp factories \nis  a  serious  problem  in  Bangladesh.  Despite  being  legally  required  to  establish  effluent \ntreatment  plants  (ETPs),  many  factories  in  these  industries  still  operate  without  one.  An  early \nstudy conducted by the Centre for Water Policy and Development estimated that less than 10% \nof  industries  in  Bangladesh  have  an  ETP. 6 Experts  estimate  that  only  30%  of  dyeing  and \nprinting units have installed ETPs.7 The discharge of large amounts of untreated effluent has a \ndramatic impact not only on the aquatic environment but also on the country\u2019s rural population, \nthe majority of whom rely on surface water sources for washing, bathing, irrigation, and fishing.  \n \n6. \nTo transform these key industries in a sustainable manner, access to long-term funding \nis  required  for  factories  to  invest  in  remediation  and  water  pollution  control.  However,  the \nfinance  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  underdeveloped,  with  long-term  funding  available  to  banks \nprimarily  through  international  financial  institutions.8 The  total  costs  of  implementing  the  CAPs \nprescribed  by  the  accord  or  the  alliance  are  $250,000\u2013$400,000  per  factory.  The  costs  are \nmuch  higher  if  a  factory  needs  to  be  relocated  and  a  new  building  is  required.  Many  of  the \ncompliant  factories  also  need  financing  for  expansion,  as  export-driven  demand  is  shifting \ntowards factories complying with the accord or alliance standards. With the construction of new \ngarment factories or expansion of existing ones, ETPs need to be built, modified, or expanded, \nwhich creates additional financing needs.  \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  BRAC  Bank  as  a  strong  candidate  for \nfunding  because  of  its  good  corporate  governance  standards,  solid  financial  performance, \nsound  safeguard  capacity,  and  experience  and  commitment  to  support  the  development  of \nsustainable  projects  in  Bangladesh.  [The  rest  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to \ncommercially sensitive information.] \n \nB. \n \n8. \nBRAC  Bank  was  established  in  July  2001  as  a  private  commercial  bank  focused  on \nproviding funding to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is the seventh-largest bank \nin terms of assets in Bangladesh ($2.52 billion as of the end of 2014). It has grown significantly \nin  a  highly  competitive  banking  market  by  establishing  its  niche  in  the  SME  space  while \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n                                                \n5    The  accord  has  more  than  80  full-time  staff,  including  16  remediation  complaints  case  handlers  and  39  safety \nengineers.  The  alliance  has  39  full-time  staff  including  a  remediation  team,  which  is  headed  by  a  chief  safety \nofficer and includes three safety case managers and 18 engineers.  \n\n6    Centre for Water Policy and Development. 2004.

The  loan  will  also  fund  construction  of \nwastewater and ETPs in the industry sector, primarily in the textile and garment industry.9  \n \n\n                                                \n9   The  Government  of  Bangladesh  classifies  industries  into  four  categories  based  on  their  environmental  impacts: \nGreen, Orange A, Orange B, and Red. In addition to textile and garment industry, the borrower will also have the \nright to use the proceeds of the proposed loan for subprojects in industries in lower environmental risk categories \n(green to orange B). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nUse of proceeds. BRAC Bank will exclusively use the proceeds of the proposed loan to \n\nB. \n \n17. \nfund sustainable projects as stipulated in the loan agreement.  \n \n18.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB.  BRAC  Bank  will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested. These reports will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) \naudited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants,  (iv)  semiannual  reporting  on  the  list  of  sustainable  projects  financed  by  ADB \nincluding details of project implementation progress, (v) annual reporting on the implementation \nstatus  of  the  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  and  gender  action  plan \n(GAP), and (vi) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed on by ADB and the \nborrower.  \n \n19. \n \n20. \nEvaluation.  Pursuant to  ADB\u2019s  operations  manual,  monitoring reports  will  be  prepared \nand  submitted to  ADB\u2019s  Office of  Risk  Management  regularly  and  at  least  annually.10 The first \nsuch report will be submitted no later than 1 year after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n21. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s loan to BRAC Bank will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i)  Providing critical long-term finance in support of textile and garment industry \nupgrades. Currently, local banks have no access to longer-term dollar finance from \ncommercial sources, as international banks only provide short-term trade finance of \nup  to  1  year  to  local  banks  in  Bangladesh,  and  there  is  no  access  to  international \ncapital  markets  because  of  the  low  country  rating.  The  longer-term  funding  from \nADB will enable BRAC Bank to improve its asset liability profile and to offer longer-\nterm dollar financing to its clients in critical sectors of the Bangladeshi economy to \nupgrade environmental, social, and safety standards.  \n\n(ii)  Enhancing BRAC Bank\u2019s environmental and social management system. [This \nsentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive  information.]  ADB  has \nproposed further enhancements to BRAC Bank\u2019s screening and monitoring process, \nincluding the expansion of the bank\u2019s due diligence checklist to include other labor \naspects. \n\n(iii)  Incorporating gender elements in financing the ready-made garment industry. \nThrough  a  GAP,  ADB  will  incorporate  a  number  of  elements  in  the  subprojects  to \nimprove  facilities  and  working  conditions  for  women  in  the  RMG  industry  in \nBangladesh.  The  GAP  has  several  substantive  and  sound  gender  design  features \nincluding  day  care,  safety,  and  health  clinics,  which  will  be  incorporated  into \noperations by the RMG factory sub-borrowers.  \n\n \nRisks \n\ninformation. \n\nD. \n \n22. \n\n \n\nKey risks of the proposed project include the following: \n(i)  Country  risk.

The  proposed  project  is  expected  to  have  strong  development  impacts, \n\n(i)  Enhanced  health  and  safety  standards  of  garment  industry  in  Bangladesh. \nDespite  being  critical  to  the  national  economy  and  internationally  competitive,  the \ntextile and garment industry in Bangladesh has a poor safety record. The proposed \nloan  will  support  the  joint  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  and  donor \ngovernments,  international  apparel  companies  and  retailers,  trade  unions,  United \nNations  agencies,  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies,  and  domestic \nindustries  to  improve  the  health  and  safety  of  workers  in  the  RMG  industry.  Since \nclose to 80% of the RMG workers are women, the project will have a direct impact \non improving the working conditions for women workers in Bangladesh. \n\n(ii)  Finance  sector  development.  The  proposed  project  will  support  BRAC  Bank  by \nproviding access to longer-term foreign currency funding, which will in turn increase \nits  ability  to  provide  attractive  long-term  foreign  currency  loans  to  clients  in  key \nsectors of the economy. \n\n(iii)  Enhanced  environmental  standards  in  the  industry  sector.  By  financing  the \ndevelopment of wastewater and effluent treatment plants, the proposed project will \ncontribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  local  industries\u2019  environmental  standard  and \nreduce  the  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  environment  and  the  country\u2019s  rural \npopulation.   \n\nOutcome.  The outcome of the proposed project is sustainable growth of BRAC Bank\u2019s \n\n \n25. \nlending for social and environmental projects.  \n  \n26. \nOutput.  The  project\u2019s  output  is  expansion  of  BRAC  Bank\u2019s  lending  to  textile  and \ngarment factories meeting adequate social and environmental safeguard standards, as well as \nits  lending  for  construction  of  wastewater  and  effluent  treatment  plants.  As  a  result  of  BRAC \nBank\u2019s  lending,  at  least  10  RMG  factories  are  expected  to  be  upgraded  or  expanded,  and  at \nleast  five  wastewater  treatment  plants  are  expected  to  be  constructed  or  expanded.  Facilities \nand working conditions for about 22,000 women workers will be improved. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nConsistency with ADB  strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to  strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance  sector  by  supporting  the \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services. 11 The  project \nsupports three priorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction \nand  inclusive  economic  growth,  (ii)  environment  and  climate  change,  and  (iii)  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  operations.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh for 2011\u20132015,12 which prioritizes private sector development to accelerate growth \nby developing the finance sector with an emphasis on clean energy, infrastructure finance, and \ncredit for SMEs. The country partnership strategy also notes that environmental considerations \nshould be integrated into sector interventions.  \n \n28. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  By  financing \nwastewater  treatment  plants  in  the  industry  sector,  the  proposed  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 which identified wastewater management services as one \nof the key elements of ADB\u2019s operations in the water sector.13 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  ADB\u2019s  loan  is  classified \nas  category  FI,  based  on  potential  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. The borrower will be prohibited from using the proceeds of the ADB loan to \nfinance  projects  that  are  category  A  under  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  investment's \npotential  environmental  and  social  impacts,  the  risks  associated  with  the  borrower's  existing \nand/or  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its  commitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  have  been  assessed. 14  The  borrower  will  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds abide  by  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations, comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and update its existing ESMS to ADB \nsatisfaction before the first disbursement of the proposed loan.15 BRAC will review government \ncertification, screen and monitor subprojects to ensure compliance with the national legislations.  \n \n30. \nBRAC Bank will be required to increase its existing staff capacity to effectively carry out \nboth  the  assessment  and  oversight  of  the  progress  of  the  safeguards  and  social  monitoring, \nincluding  aspects  of  labor  conditions  and  fire  safety,  as  part  of  its  ESMS  enhancement.
