THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for \nRecovery Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX). The project will provide \nthe Government of Sri Lanka with immediate and flexible financing to support the national  \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination program through APVAX and from the regular \ncountry allocation.1 The APVAX allocation comprises a rapid response component (RRC) to \nsupport the purchase of Asian Development Bank (ADB) eligible COVID-19 vaccines, while the \nproject investment component (PIC) financed by the regular country allocation will support \nstrengthening of the vaccination information dissemination and monitoring systems, vaccine \ntransportation capacity, and vaccine-related medical waste management. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 vision for achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable \nAsia and the Pacific.2 The project contributes to addressing remaining nonincome and income \npoverty and to reducing inequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, fostering regional cooperation and integration, tackling \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka. \n \n2.  Sri Lanka has met all APVAX access criteria (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated adverse  The pandemic has negatively affected the social, health, and economic sectors, mainly \nimpact of COVID-19  because of the interventions taken to curtail the pandemic. The economic growth rate for \n2020 was \u20133.6%. At the end of the first wave of the pandemic, as many as 78% of the \nsample population were completely affected with loss of income. Among them, 44% lost \ntheir jobs while 11% reported loss of their livelihood capital resources. Thirty percent of \nthe surveyed population could not access health services, while as many as 47% could \nnot get services related to maternal and child health. \nCompleted needs  The government assessed the vaccine logistics and cold-chain maintenance, vaccine \nassessment  information management system, public communications, and safety surveillance. \nNational vaccination  The NDVP was approved by the Presidential Task Force for COVID-19 Vaccination \nallocation plan  Program in January 2021. The plan details financing and implementation steps for \nvaccinating up to 50% of the population (11 million people) in 2021. It includes a \nprioritization plan that puts health workers and the elderly first, and is aligned with the \nvalues framework for COVID-19 vaccine allocation of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group \nof Experts on Immunization. \nIncremental medical  The MOH issued guidelines for COVID-19-related medical waste management on 20 \nwaste management  March 2020 and developed a medical waste management plan for managing COVID-19-\nplan  related waste (including vaccination waste) in February 2021. \nGovernor\u2019s letter  The governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s commitment to implement its NDVP \nand compliance with the APVAX eligibility criteria for ADB financing was received on 20 \nMay 2021.  \nEffective development  The development partners, including ADB, work collaboratively, coordinate, and share \npartner coordination  experiences  via  the  Development  Partners  Secretariat.

Sri Lanka is an island with a population of 21.9 million.3 The country stands \non the cusp of being an upper middle-income country. It was reclassified as a lower middle-\nincome country in July 2020 after being an upper middle-income country for a year based on its \nclassification as of July 2019.4 The economy entered the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 after \nsuffering a series of shocks that slowed growth. The onset of the pandemic came less than 12 \nmonths after the April 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks that severely impacted tourism and \ngrowth. Prior to that, a constitutional crisis in late 2018 and droughts in 2016 and 2017 also \nweighed heavily on the economy. Sri Lanka\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth has shown \na recent downward trend and averaged 3.7% during 2015\u20132019 compared to 6.8% during 2010\u2013\n2014 on the back of a peace dividend and rehabilitation after the end of the civil conflict in 2009 \n(footnote 3). The GDP per capita for 2020 was $3,682, down from $3,852 in 2019 (footnote 3). \n \n4.  The country has made significant progress in the last few decades on socioeconomic and \nhuman development indicators in ensuring access to health services for all. Maternal mortality \nhad fallen to 32.0 per 100,000 live births in 2018 and infant mortality to 10.1 per 1,000 live births \nin 2019.5 Sri Lanka\u2019s population is rapidly aging, and as much as 16% of the population is over \nthe age of 60 years.6 The communicable disease burden has been well controlled, with most of \nthe  vaccine-preventable  diseases  (e.g.,  polio,  neonatal  tetanus,  rubella,  and  diphtheria) \neliminated or nearly eliminated with immunization coverage of the majority of vaccines at more \nthan 99%.7 Some vector-borne diseases like malaria and filaria have been eliminated, while \ndiseases like dengue and leptospirosis are endemic. The noncommunicable disease (NCD) \nburden is significant, however, accounting for as many as 75% of all deaths, and 20% of these \nare people less than 60 years old. NCDs are a serious economic and public health issue in Sri \nLanka, with a large proportion of the population exposed to risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, \nunhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity) with inadequate quality and \ncoverage for early detection and management of NCDs. \n \n5.  Status of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases were first reported in Sri Lanka in January \n2020 and the first wave of COVID-19 was during March\u2013June 2020, the second wave was during \nSeptember 2020\u2013March 2021, and the ongoing third wave has been going on since 25 April 2021. \nAs of 2 June 2021, Sri Lanka had reported 192,547 confirmed cases and 1,566 deaths.8 The third \nwave continues to bring an unprecedented and exponential number of COVID-19 patients to \nhealth facilities, with the effective reproduction rate increasing from 0.85 on 1 October 2020 to \n1.08 on 2 June 2021. In that period, the number of daily new confirmed cases increased from \n0.33 per million people to 135.23 per million people.9 The reported spread of the new coronavirus \nvariants which are known to be more infectious add to this increasing trend. \n \n \n3  Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). 2021.

Measures introduced by the government to control the pandemic. The government \nhas introduced many measures since the reporting of the first COVID-19 positive case in Sri \nLanka.  Travel  restrictions  were  introduced,  the  capacity  of  molecular  biology  testing  was \nincreased, all schools were closed, and personal hygiene measures on handwashing and social \ndistancing have been enforced since March 2020. A nationwide curfew was imposed on 20 March \n2020, which continued until 11 May 2020, and a night-time curfew continued until 28 June 2020. \nWith the increasing number of cases because of the second wave since early October 2020, \ntravel restrictions were imposed, selected areas were locked down, intensive contact tracing \nmeasures were put in place, and suspected cases were quarantined, but the interventions were \nmuch less restrictive given the need to re-open the economy. As the economy is largely tourism \ndependent, the government has placed the highest priority on vaccines for economic recovery. \nThe COVID-19 vaccination rollout based on the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for \nCOVID-19 Vaccines (NDVP) was initiated on 29 January 2021 and is ongoing.10 \n \n7.  Cost for the economy. GDP contracted by 3.6% in 2020 because of the impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic as the economy was hit early with a 1.8% contraction in the first quarter of \n2020 and then contracted sharply by 16.4% in the second quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 measures \nrestricted mobility and slowed economic activity considerably.11 Real GDP for 2020 was $51.4 \nbillion, an estimated $3.8 billion lower than what it would have been without COVID-19.12 The \neconomy was adversely impacted by the simultaneous demand and supply shocks coming from \nthe global pandemic, which affected most of the major sectors of the economy, with the impact \nbeing particularly severe in the second quarter of 2020. As tourism remained shuttered for most \nof 2020, foreign exchange earnings were affected, which along with an outflow of capital put \npressure on the exchange rate and reserves. Containment measures severely affected the \nservices sector, in particular the tourism sector, which contributed on average 10.4% of the GDP \nduring 2015\u20132019.13 Exports suffered because of demand shock in major export markets and as \na new wave of the pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 affected hubs of manufacturing activity. \nRemittances grew by 5.8% in 2020, which supported consumption and buttressed foreign exchange \nreserves, which were $5.7 billion in December 2020 (equivalent to 4.2 months of imports).14 \nEconomic recovery remains subdued, with a 1.3% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.   \n \n8.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. COVID-19 and control measures have made \nmore people vulnerable to poverty. Poverty rates and the number of poor people in Sri Lanka \nincreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which reverses the trend of reduction in poverty in \nrecent years. The average unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in 2020 from 4.8% in 2019.15 The \npoverty rate is estimated to have increased from 9.2% in 2019 to 11.7% in 2020 (at $3.2 in 2011 \npurchasing power parity) and from 38.6% in 2019 to 42.3% in 2020 (at $5.5 in 2011 purchasing \npower parity).16 Of the daily wage-earner households sampled, 65% in April 2020 reported that \ntheir income had stopped completely relative to February 2020.17 Over the medium-term, a slow \neconomic recovery risks raising unemployment levels and suppressing earnings in the informal \n \n10 Summary of National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Department of Census and Statistics.

Impact  on  gender.  Women\u2019s  well-being  and  safety  worsened  with  increased  care \nresponsibilities and enforced lockdowns. Some women have had to be confined with their abusers \nwith limited access to helplines and support. While 24-hour helplines were available, not all \nwomen are aware of these services, are able to make a call, or make the call for various reasons.19 \nBefore COVID-19 lockdowns and curfews were imposed, about 250 patients were admitted daily \nto the accident ward of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka for gender-based violence. However, \nduring  the  lockdown  period,  this  decreased  to  66  admissions,  including  females  sexually \nassaulted by their husbands.20 Of all women who are gainfully employed, about 51.1% work in \nthe informal sector (compared to 60.8% of all employed men).21 Because of restricted mobility \nand  the  increased  (unpaid)  care  burden,  women\u2019s  earning  capacity  and  productive  time, \nlivelihood, and economic activities have been adversely affected.  \n \n10.  Impact on the health system. With the reporting of COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka, the \ngovernment reorganized mainly the secondary health care services to manage the increasing \nCOVID-19 patients to minimize the effects on other services. In addition to the National Infectious \nDiseases Hospital, six other secondary health care facilities initially were converted to COVID-19 \ntreatment hospitals and many more facilities became quarantine centers. In addition, dedicated \nstaff were provided with required personal protective equipment and infection prevention and \ncontrol training and support. Laboratory services were also scaled up to provide polymerase chain \nreaction testing for COVID-19. In March 2020, only the Medical Research Institute and a few \nuniversity research laboratories were capable of testing for COVID-19. There are 38 laboratories \n(including 27 public ones), which had an initial capacity of 18,000 tests per day but this has \nincreased to more than 28,000 tests per day since the start of the third wave in late April 2021. \n \n11.  The first wave of interventions, which introduced frequent handwashing, social distancing, \nand better personal hygiene practices, indirectly reduced ill-health episodes requiring outpatient \ncare services. But the interventions which controlled population movement\u2014curfew and travel \nrestrictions\u2014severely disrupted the long-term clinic care of approximately 2.5 million mainly NCD \npatients who seek care at government health facilities each month. While emergency care \nservices were always available and the monthly drug quotas to clinic patients were dispatched \nvia regular mail services, elective surgeries, dental care, eye care, and other treatment options \nfor inpatient services were reduced. Access to regular routine services was also curtailed because \nof COVID-19-related restrictions, with more than 30% of families reporting that they could not \naccess health services and 47% of families with children under 5 years could not access services \nbecause of transport and access restrictions during the first wave of the pandemic.22 \n \n12.  COVID-19 vaccine needs assessment. Based on the Vaccine Introduction Readiness \nAssessment Tool and Vaccine Readiness Assessment Framework assessments completed for \nSri Lanka in January 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO), it was identified that only \nrelatively small gaps in investments need to be filled to carry out a mass vaccination program to \ncover the eligible population. This includes the need to further expand vaccine-related medical \nwaste  disposal  services  and  enhance transport  facilities  to  strengthen  cold-chain  transport \n \n18 UNICEF Sri Lanka. 2020.

National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines. The Ministry of \nHealth  (MOH)  convened  the  National  Coordination  Committee  for  COVID-19  vaccines  in \nNovember 2020 to work with advisory groups and technical subcommittees on (i) COVID-19 \nvaccines, prioritization, and targeting; (ii) logistics for COVID-19 vaccination; and (iii) costing for \nCOVID-19 vaccination. The committee developed the NDVP on 18 January 2021, which was \nbased  on  WHO  Strategic  Advisory  Group  of  Experts  on  Immunization  (SAGE) \nrecommendations.23 In 2021, the government intends to make vaccines available, free of charge \nto all, to cover at the minimum 50% of the population including all frontline workers, comorbid \npopulation, working adults, and people over the age of 60 years. By 2023, the government \nanticipates providing vaccination to 80% of the population. \n \n14.  The MOH holds the overall responsibility for oversight, coordination, and implementation \nof the national COVID-19 vaccination program. Under the MOH, all nine provincial and 26 regional \ndirectors of health services covering 354 medical officers of health units across the country are \ninvolved in administering vaccines to the population. The MOH is supported by technical units: (i) \nthe Epidemiology Unit for vaccine transportation, vaccination, and monitoring; (ii) the Health \nPromotion  Bureau  for  public  communications;  (iii)  the  Environment  Unit  for  medical  waste \nmanagement; (iv) the Health Information Unit for information systems; and (v) the Medical \nSupplies Division (MSD) for storage and cold-chain logistics.  \n \n15.  The  National  Medicines  Regulatory  Authority  (NMRA)  approves  and  registers  new \nmedicines and medical products including vaccines through the NMRA Act No 5 of 2015. The \nState Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka (SPC), the mandated procurement agency of the \nMOH, will procure vaccines from bilaterally negotiated contracts with vaccine manufacturers and \nrelated consumables (syringes, safety boxes, etc.) from suppliers. The government also has other \noptions to procure vaccines from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Advance \nMarket Commitment mechanism and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).  \n \n16.  The MSD-managed Medical Supplies Management Information System closely monitors \nthe cold-chain system for the routine immunization program throughout the country at each level \nfor all cold rooms and ice-lined refrigerators storing vaccine at the central stores, the 26 regional \nmedical supplies divisions, and at all 354 medical officer of health areas. Based on the cold-chain \ncapacity assessments, the government has adequate capacity to store approximately 8 million \ndoses  of  COVID-19  vaccines  at  2o\u20138o Celsius  (C)  and  about  2 million  doses  at  ultra-cold \ntemperature (\u201370oC). This is in addition to the routine vaccines. \n \n17.  In March 2021, the government issued updated guidelines for managing the vaccination \nprogram in the country.24 At each field vaccination center, a minimum of seven health staff are \nexpected to manage the vaccination and 98 people are to be vaccinated in 1 day across 2,000 \nvaccination centers, and over a 3-week period the MOH is ready to vaccinate 4.1 million people \n(20% of the country\u2019s population). With the vaccination, a separate communication strategy to \nreduce  hesitancy, manage  urgency,  and  to  inform  of the  probable  adverse  effects  and  of \nvaccination sites will be initiated via UNICEF using the World Bank funds in close collaboration \nwith the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB). The vaccination information will be reported via the \nroutine system using the e-National Immunization Program and via the newly introduced COVID-\n \n23 WHO. 2020.

The guidelines that are routinely used\u2014on the adverse effects following \nimmunization and the adverse effects of special interest\u2014will also be used for the COVID-19 \nvaccination. Relevant staff are continuously trained and updated with new information on adverse \neffects following immunization and adverse effects of special interest as required, and updated \ncirculars to this effect are continuously issued.25 The government instructed all health facilities to \nfollow the medical waste management plan used for infectious waste to dispose of COVID-19-\nrelated waste. \n  \n18.  Access to vaccines. Even though Sri Lanka was unable to secure advance bookings of \nCOVID-19 vaccines in 2020 because of resource constraints, arrangements are now under way \nto have sufficient financing upfront to vaccinate the population and be prepared to mitigate the \nrisks from highly contagious variants and future waves to facilitate the reopening of the economy. \nThe  government  received  a  donation  of  500,000  doses  of  COVID-19  vaccines  from  the \nGovernment  of  India  (AstraZeneca\u2013Oxford  University  vaccine  manufactured  by  the  Serum \nInstitute of India) on 28 January 2021 and a donation of 600,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine \nfrom the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China on 31 March 2021. From 29 January \n2021, the government successfully vaccinated more than 80% of frontline workers with the first \ndose in less than 3 weeks, and second dose vaccinations were completed by mid-May 2021 for \nall frontline workers.   \n \n19.  Vaccine financing needs. Sri Lanka is a small, open economy highly dependent on the \nservices sector and tourism, and the government is putting the highest priority on protecting its \npeople with COVID-19 vaccination as a key strategy for economic recovery. Based on the NDVP \napproved in January 2021, the cost estimate for reaching COVID-19 vaccination coverage of 80% \nof the population is estimated at $270 million, which includes only the purchase of vaccines, \nadditional cold-chain equipment, and operational costs.26 It excludes around $28 million for \nstrengthening the information system, expanding cold-chain transportation facilities, staff mobility \nduring the vaccination campaign, and vaccine waste disposal. The proposed project and the \nWorld Bank project intend to provide support of $231 million to meet a substantial part of these \nneeds.  The  government  is  monitoring  the  pandemic  situation  and  the  vaccine  deployment \nprogress to decide the next stage of financing. If required, further external assistance may be \nsought in the future, including additional financing from APVAX, or cofinancing.27 \n   \n20.  Development partner coordination. ADB closely coordinates with other development \npartners through the United Nations-hosted Development Partners Secretariat, which coordinates \nall development assistance. In addition, ADB is also a regular partner of the development partner \ndiscussions coordinated by the MOH. A development partner coordination committee for COVID-\n19 vaccination was established with WHO, UNICEF, ADB, and the World Bank as members. The \ncommittee  conducts  regular  meetings  and  shares  the  contributions  to  the  NDVP  by  each \ndevelopment partner for effective use of financing. \n \n21.  The project will collaborate with WHO and UNICEF in terms of technical assistance to \nsupport strengthening of immunization tracker systems, cold chains, and logistics. ADB has also \nbeen closely coordinating with the World Bank to provide coordinated assistance and to synergize \n \n25 MOH. 2021.

The government had procured \n33.5 million doses through bilateral arrangements at a cost of around $311 million. The NDVP costing scenario from \nJanuary 2021 was based on $7 per dose. Since then the situation has changed, where the cost is now around $10 \nper dose, and the situation may continue to change.  \n27 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has initiated discussions with the government for possible cofinancing. \n ", "7 \nthe results and outcomes. A detailed development partner matrix is included in the development \ncoordination linked document accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n22.  The proposed project will support the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure COVID-19 \nvaccine access to the population to curtail the pandemic, minimize the socioeconomic and health \neffects that result from it, and initiate the robust economic recovery process. The project is \ntargeting the entire country across all 26 health districts in all nine provinces while ensuring that \nthe geographically, socially, and economically deprived populations are protected from COVID-\n19 and its effects. The beneficiary population of the project is the total population of 22 million.28 \n \n23.  Impact and outcome. The expected project impact will be the enhancement of the \nresilience and responsiveness of the health system to curtail the COVID-19 virus spread; reduce \nmorbidity and mortality; and reduce the negative health, social, and economic effects of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka.29 The outcome will be priority populations of Sri Lanka \nvaccinated against COVID-19 as per the NDVP without compromising routine vaccine services \nand other health services. This outcome will be achieved through the following four outputs. \n \n24.  Output 1: COVID-19 vaccines delivered. Through the rapid response component (RRC), \noutput 1 will finance procurement of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to cover 18.2% of the \npopulation (4 million population).30 By 2021, the government intends to cover at least 50% of the \nadult population including all frontline workers, comorbid population, working adults, and people \nover the age of 60. The output will support the government in reaching 80% COVID-19 vaccine \ncoverage by 2023, with data disaggregated by sex, age, and geography.31 The vaccination \ncampaign has already started following the NDVP and COVID-19 vaccination protocols.  \n \n25.  Output  2:  Vaccination  information  dissemination  and  monitoring  systems \nstrengthened. Through the project investment component (PIC), output 2 will support the \nEpidemiology Unit in the MOH to improve and enhance the electronic National Immunization \nProgram (e-NIP) and its electronic adverse effects following immunization system under the \nroutine vaccination program to include the COVID-19 vaccination program. This output will also \nsupport the Health Information Unit in the MOH to introduce a COVID-19 immunization tracker \nthat will provide real-time individual beneficiary data and will help monitor the COVID-19 vaccine \ndeployment. Although aggregate information is available from e-NIP, the new interoperable \nsystems will enable real-time data on both routine and COVID-19 vaccination coverage by age, \nsex, and geographic area. Surveillance data will be shared with global and regional partners to \n \n28 22 million beneficiaries from all four project outputs (not only the 4 million vaccine beneficiaries under output 1). \n29 Government of Sri Lanka. 2020.

ADB\u2019s \nSupport to Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Access. Manila. \n30 ADB will finance expenditures in relation to the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the APVAX eligibility \ncriteria stated in para. 29 (including footnotes 28, 29, and 30) of the APVAX policy paper (ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Support \nto Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Access. Manila; ADB. 2021. Amendment to ADB\u2019s Support to Enhance COVID-19 \nVaccine Access. Manila). The project will be guided by the Indicative Master List of Eligible Items, and Agreed List \nof Acceptable Expenditure Items (\u2018Positive List\u2019), for ADB-financing under the Rapid Response Component \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 In addition, the Government of Sri Lanka has requested $80.5 million from the World Bank to meet the cost of \nvaccines and the rollout of the program for 13.6% of the total population, while the COVAX facility will provide \nvaccines for 20% of the total population; Government of India in-kind donation for 1.1% of the total population; and \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in-kind donation for 1.3% of the total population.   \n ", "8 \nsupport a collective response to the pandemic.32 Under the output, it is therefore intended to \npurchase and supply laptop computers and tablets to all medical officer of health units (354 units \ncurrently, each health unit will receive two laptop computers, eight tablets, and five routers) and \nprovide training for managing the real-time data entry. \n \n26.  Output 2 will also support the MSD to purchase the required consumables, supplies, and \nessential equipment to roll out the vaccination program as described in the NDVP. This output \nalso provides support to the MSD to improve the logistics, regulatory capacity, and procurement \ncapacity  by  enhancing  the  existing  Medical  Supplies  Management  Information  System  for \nmanaging and tracking all drugs, vaccines, and consumables in the public health system. In \naddition, this output will support the MSD to collaborate with the Ministry of Finance to initiate e-\nprocurement  practices  in  the  health  sector.  This  includes  upgrading  software  programs, \npurchasing computers, establishing internet connectivity, training, and networking hospitals and \nrelated institutions. \n \n27.  Furthermore, support is provided to the HPB of the MOH to promote gender equality and \nsocial inclusion in access to the COVID-19 vaccination. Activities will include training community \ngroups in reaching out to women and other vulnerable population groups with information on \nvaccinations (including specific information for pregnant and lactating women, or women with \npreexisting conditions and disabilities) and providing direct support to vulnerable groups to access \nthe vaccination and related services in the respective medical officer of health areas. Finally, \noutput 2 provides the management and technical support required to implement the project. This \nincludes hiring experts for project management services like finance, procurement, engineering, \ninformation technology, and monitoring and evaluation for the project management unit (PMU) of \nthe  ongoing  ADB-financed  Health  System  Enhancement  Project  (HSEP).33  In  addition, the \nrelevant MOH technical units (Epidemiology, MSD, HPB, Environment, and Health Information) \nwill each appoint a focal point to oversee respective components of the project. \n   \n28.  Output 3: Capacity of vaccine transport systems expanded. Through the PIC, output \n3 will support enhancement of the capacity of the vaccine transport system from central to regional \nlevels and the vaccine distribution system from regional drug stores to the vaccination centers. \nWhen vaccines arrive in the country, they are stored in the central cold rooms managed by the \nEpidemiology Unit of the MOH. The Epidemiology Unit practices a push-out system; regularly \ntrains its staff, including drivers, on cold-chain maintenance; maintains its vehicles; and delivers \nthe vaccines in adequate quantities to each of the 26 regional drug stores in Sri Lanka. The \nregional drug stores deliver vaccines to the divisional stores for the routine system, but for COVID-\n19 vaccination program, as it is managed as a campaign, vaccines are delivered to the vaccination \ncenters directly. This requires adequate cold-chain transport facilities for safe and timely delivery \nof vaccines. Therefore, this output will support the purchase of a small refrigerated truck for each \nof the 26 regional drug stores and 10 large trucks for the MOH. In addition, to maintain the routine \nvaccination  program  alongside  the  rollout  of  the  COVID-19  vaccination  program,  transport \nfacilities will be provided to ensure adequate human resources are mobilized for regional stores, \ndivisional  offices,  vaccination  centers,  and  regional  offices  for  program  supervision  and \nmanagement. This output will also provide transport facilities to enable vulnerable women and \npeople with a disability to access vaccination centers.  \n \n32 The Epidemiology Unit reports daily on its website (www.epid.gov.lk) the relevant data and, from March 2021, has \nexpanded the sentinel surveillance sites for tracking COVID-19 cases by testing all COVID-19 suspected patients at \nall secondary and tertiary care hospitals. The government is expected to share data updates with WHO, South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and other regional and global entities in the long term. \n33 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "9 \n29.  Output 4: Vaccine-related medical waste management strengthened. Through the \nPIC, output 4 will support the implementation of the Medical Waste Management Plan of the MOH. \nWith the expanded COVID-19 vaccination, as many as 32.0 million syringes and nearly 3.2 million \nvials will need to be discarded. The large number of polymerase chain reaction tests carried out \n(nearly 2 million) add to the volume of COVID-19 waste. In addition, with the establishment and \nconversion  of  secondary  care  hospitals  into  COVID-19 managed  hospitals, many  of these \nhospitals require well-designed sewerage management for appropriate infection prevention and \ncontrol. This output will support the establishment of a sewerage system in 26 of the 87 (30%) of \nthe secondary care hospitals in all nine provinces that require such systems. \n \n30.  Output 4 will also support improved medical waste management arrangements in six of \nthe nine provinces in the country.34 Based on the Medical Waste Management Plan of the MOH, \nin the six provinces of Northern, Eastern, North Central, North Western, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa, \nthe MOH will establish satellite waste management centers in identified secondary and tertiary \ncare hospitals in each of the districts. This output will support the establishment of incinerators \nand waste segregation at 12 satellite hospitals representing the six provinces. \n  \n31.  Value addition. The project is developed in close collaboration with the government, the \nWorld Bank, WHO, and UNICEF. ADB supports the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the \nnational  vaccination  program  covers  all  parts  of  the  country  including  geographically  and \neconomically disadvantaged areas such as post-conflict-affected areas and plantations. The \nproject is also supporting the strengthening of the monitoring system, the cold-chain transport \nsystem, and medical waste management related to COVID-19, which helps address all aspects \nof the vaccination program. Ongoing technical assistance will also help strengthen the vaccine \ndelivery system.35 The medical waste management component of the project will benefit six \nprovinces which contain a large number of disadvantaged and remote areas. The project is \nsupporting a novel immunization tracker which aims to provide disaggregated data in real time. \nThe ongoing HSEP is supporting the health sector including COVID-19 response activities. The \nexperienced HSEP PMU provides a solid foundation for effective implementation of the APVAX \nproject. Most importantly, vaccination across the country supported by this project is critical for \neconomic recovery and to restore economic growth, especially for tourism and other services \nsectors. Without vaccination, economic growth will be much lower than currently expected.  \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n32.  The project is estimated to cost $161.85 million (Table 2), inclusive of taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation. Detailed \ncost estimates by expenditure category for each output are included in the project administration \nmanual (PAM) in the linked documents in Appendix 2.36 \n \n33.  The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $84 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources under the RRC financed by APVAX and (ii) a regular loan of $66 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources under the PIC financed by the regular country allocation.37 The loan \nunder the RRC will have a 10-year term including a grace period of 3 years, while the loan under \n \n34 Medical waste management activities in the three provinces of Western, Southern, and Central (nine districts of \nColombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy, Nuwera Eliya, Matale, Galle, Matara, and Hambantota) are currently managed \nby a private firm under a contract with the MOH.

Details are described in the climate change \nassessment in the linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n36.  The MOH will be the executing and implementing agency. The project implementation \nunit, the PMU, will be guided by the project\u2019s National Steering Committee, which will be chaired \nby the secretary of the MOH and have representation from all project stakeholders including the \nMinistry of Finance. For both ADB and World Bank projects, there are respective PMUs that will \nclosely  coordinate  with  the  MOH  and  its  relevant  technical  units  (described  in  para.  14). \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 36). \n \n37.  Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 1), ADB member country procurement eligibility restrictions \nwill be waived, and universal procurement will apply. The SPC, the mandated procurement \nagency of the MOH, will conduct direct procurement of vaccines with vaccine manufacturers and \nancillary items with suppliers. The SPC is a state-owned entity established in 1971 under the \nState Industrial Corporations Act Number 49 of 1957. Other goods and services will be procured \nby the PMU. In addition, the government has other options of vaccine procurement, such as \nCOVAX Advance Market Commitment and UNICEF. Value for money in vaccine procurement will \nbe achieved through (i) selecting candidate vaccine types that are best suited to the domestic \nlogistics supply chain and distribution mechanisms; (ii) engaging with COVAX and manufacturers \nthat  have  advantageous  vaccine  availability  and  delivery  timelines;  and  (iii)  entering  into \nagreements on terms and conditions that are reasonable, noting the currently constrained market \nfor vaccines globally. Value for money in procurement of consumables associated with vaccines \nand others will be achieved by selecting the most suitable procurement methods in terms of size \nof procurement, consideration of market conditions of the items to be procured, and time allowed \nfor the process.  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2021\u2013June 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National Steering Committee comprising all project stakeholders including \nthe Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Health \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Ministry of Health  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit  \nProcurement  Direct contracting / OCB / RFQ   Multiple contracts  $133.7 million \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection /  Multiple contracts  $1.0 million \nfirm recruitment (CQS) \nRetroactive financing and advance  Withdrawals from the loan account may be made for (i) advance financing \nfinancing   for up to 6 months of estimated eligible expenditures or 50% of the RRC \nfinancing amount whichever is lower; and (ii) eligible expenditures in \nrelation to vaccine procurement incurred before loan effectiveness but not \nmore than 12 months before signing of the loan agreement, equivalent to a \nmaximum of 30% of the loan amount.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n38.  Economic analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis. \nThe  proposed  $150  million  project  is  an  integral  part  of  and  contributes  to  50%  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s $298 million national COVID-19 vaccination program to reach 80% population \ncoverage. With the support from the proposed project, the government can substantially avert the \ncost  of  productivity  and  productive  time  lost;  reduce  public  spending  such  as  on  testing, \nhospitalization, and quarantine; and bring the economy back to normal by significantly easing the \nCOVID-19 disease burden through the national COVID-19 vaccination program. Accelerating the \naccess to COVID-19 vaccines and enabling a comprehensive, timely, and efficient vaccination \nprogram with monitoring in place is considered the fundamental way to substantially reduce \nmortality and morbidity and lead to a resumption of economic activities. Successful deployment \nof vaccination is critical for tourism and for the overall economy to recover. Vaccine deployment \nwill also help the government better manage its fiscal and debt situation, as increased growth will \nallow for revenues to improve.  \n \n39.  Financial sustainability. This project represents only 0.25% of Sri Lanka\u2019s public debt \nand will not affect Sri Lanka\u2019s public debt profile. With higher economic growth and a better fiscal \nposition than otherwise, this project will help the government better manage its fiscal and debt \nsituations.38 The project outputs are considered public goods with positive externalities. As there \nis no opportunity for cost recovery, a financial viability assessment is not required. Almost 80% of \nthe project base cost will be used to procure vaccines and medical consumables which will be \ndiscarded after use, and only about 14% will be invested in developing sewerage systems in \nselected hospitals as well as in procuring equipment to be repurposed for general use in various \nmedical  institutions  after  project  completion.  The  incremental  operation  and  maintenance \nrequirements of these assets are expected to be negligible, and the funds will be made available \nby the recipient entities as the facilities provided will strengthen their routine operations. To ensure \nthe project is sustainable, the project will finance the operation and maintenance costs of the \nsewerage systems created and incinerators procured under the project until project completion. \nIn addition, the government has provided assurance that (i) adequate budget support to cover \nincremental operation and maintenance will be provided to the respective entities and (ii) all \nentities receiving equipment will maintain sound asset management practices.  \n \n40.  Macroeconomic and debt situation. Sri Lanka faces significant economic challenges \nwhich have been exacerbated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the central \ngovernment debt\u2013GDP ratio was 101.0% as at the end of 2020. Macroeconomic and debt \n \n38 Macroeconomic and Debt Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nanalysis (footnote 38) shows that Sri Lanka\u2019s debt remains vulnerable to slower growth, rise in \nprimary deficit, and exchange rate depreciation. The government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework \nenvisages reducing the debt\u2013GDP ratio to 75% by 2025 by reducing the fiscal deficit from 8.8% \nof GDP in 2021 to 4.0% in 2025. However, the prolonged impacts of COVID-19 and slow \neconomic recovery (1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020) are affecting its initial implementation, \nwhile the government is seeking support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other \nexternal financing agencies to bridge the gap.39 ADB is closely monitoring the macroeconomic \nand  fiscal  conditions  and  consulting  with  the  government,  along  with  the  IMF  and  other \ndevelopment partners, on appropriate means to help achieve the medium-term fiscal framework \ntargets. Vaccination efforts are critical to better managing the fiscal and debt situation. Debt \nanalysis shows that debt is likely to be higher without the vaccination as economic recovery will \nbe slower and the fiscal situation will be weaker.40  \n \nB.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n41.  The  government  has  been  strengthening  anticorruption  measures,  including  the \nenforcement of existing anticorruption laws, further empowering institutions to deal specifically \nwith corruption, and implementing the 5-year Anti-Corruption Action Plan with the target of making \nSri Lanka a corruption-free nation by 2023. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOH. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 36). \n \n42.  The  NMRA  approves  and  registers  new  medicines  and  medical  products  including \nvaccines through the NMRA Act No 5 of 2015. Emergency use authorization for new vaccines is \ndone through the legal provision under section 109 of the NMRA Act No 5 of 2015. WHO also \nprovides a listing of approved vaccines and these recommendations are also considered when \nthe NMRA provides clearance at the country level.  \n \nC.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.41 \n \n44.  Environment (category B). Project outputs 1\u20133 will not result in any significant adverse \nenvironmental  impact  or  significant  health  and  safety  risks.  The  MOH  has  drafted  and \nimplemented a comprehensive national policy on health care waste management. The MOH on \n20  March  2020  issued  a  guide  on  management  of  COVID-19  infectious  waste  including \nimmunization  waste.  Further,  the  main  regulatory  tools  implemented  under  the  National \nEnvironmental Act No. 47 of 1980 and its amendments (No. 56 of 1988 and No. 53 of 2000)\u2014\nsuch as (i) the environmental impact assessment process, (ii) environment protection license and \nscheduled  waste  management  license  procedures,  (iii)  standards  for  discharge  and  waste \ndisposal, and (iv) international good practices as recommended by WHO\u2014are being implemented \nby the MOH.42 Therefore, project outputs 1\u20133 are classified category C for environment. Civil \n \n39  The specific measures include (i) a $1.5 billion equivalent swap facility by the People\u2019s Bank of China in March 2021, \n(ii) a $500 million loan facility by the China Development Bank in April 2021, and (iii) a proposed new special drawing \nright allocation by the IMF of $780 million (equal to 0.12% of $650 billion).  \n40 ADB has maintained a regular dialogue with the IMF on Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomic and debt situation. The IMF \nacknowledges ADB\u2019s assistance for vaccination as critical to recovery. \n41 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n42 WHO.  2014.  Safe  Management  of  Wastes  from  Health-care  Activities.  Geneva;  WHO.  2019.  Overview  of \nTechnologies for the Treatment of Infectious and Sharp Waste from Health Care Facilities. Geneva. \n ", "14 \nworks under output 4 are limited to renovating COVID-19 designated hospitals and strengthening \nmedical  waste  management  via  the  provision  of  incinerators  to  satellite  hospitals  in  six \nprovinces.43 Although civil works will be carried out within existing government hospital facilities, \nsuch works have potential for temporary and site-specific adverse environmental impacts, which \nmay qualify as category B as per the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. Thus, the overall project \nis classified category B for environment based on output 4. \n \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The civil works to improve and strengthen \nmedical waste management will be carried out within existing government hospital facilities. No \ninvoluntary  land  acquisition  or  land  use  restriction  resulting  in  any  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement is anticipated. \n \n46.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not affect the dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or affect the territories or natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as their ancestral domain.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n47.  Poverty in Sri Lanka is more relative than absolute; 4.1% of the population lived below the \npoverty line in 2016.44 Multidimensional poverty levels (based on 10 indicators across the three \ndimensions of health, education, and living standards) across sectors indicates that 12.4% of \nestate sector households are multidimensional poor. Further, the vulnerability to multidimensional \npoverty is observed in 11.9% of households in Sri Lanka, with the estate sector reporting 22.4% \nof households being vulnerable to poverty and the rural sector reporting 12.7%.45 Weak market \nlinks\u2014evident in limited access to comprehensive, high-quality public services and employment \nin the formal sector\u2014have placed this poorer group of the population at a disadvantage. Poverty \npersists in many districts because of multiple variables such as low and/or irregular income, rapid \nurbanization, high population density (Central province), low education levels, poor health status, \nrising indebtedness and weak social capital, food insecurity, susceptibility to disasters and \nresultant low levels of resilience, and weak connectivity. \n \n48.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project will facilitate (i) \ntraining civil society organizations to effectively mobilize community support to the national \nvaccination program targeting women and excluded and vulnerable groups; (ii) improving access \nof women and excluded and vulnerable groups facing mobility constraints through dedicated \ntransportation facilities; (iii) conducting a survey in six provinces to identify and monitor vaccine \nhesitancy  among  vulnerable  groups,  with  60%  of  surveyed  participants  being  women;  (iv) \ndeveloping and disseminating public information communication materials addressing identified \ngender gaps and, through the use of all national languages, ensure effective outreach to women \nand excluded and vulnerable groups; (v) monitoring and reporting on gender equity and social-\ninclusion-related information in the COVID-19 vaccination beneficiary database system; (vi) \nincreasing HPB staff capacity to reach out to women and excluded and vulnerable groups with \neffective communication  strategies;  and (vii)  recruiting  a full-time  gender  equity  and  social \ninclusion consultant to support the PMU in implementing and monitoring above activities. \n \n \n43 An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared to guide the screening, categorization, and \nassessment of subprojects under output 4. Specific locations of subprojects will be identified following the subproject \nselection criteria in the framework. Additional capacity building programs will be provided to the MOH, including those \non safeguards requirements and medical waste management. \n44 ADB. 2020. Basic Statistics 2020.

A financial management assessment of the MOH has been conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines.46 An assessment was also conducted on the NDVP in the areas of inventory \nmanagement, data management, accounting, oversight, and audit. The MOH has an established \ntrack record in conducting vaccination programs, and adequate procedures and practices are in \nplace. Moreover, the ongoing HSEP PMU that will implement the APVAX project, has satisfactory \nfinancial management performance. However, the premitigation financial management risk is \nassessed substantial, mainly because of (i) the scale and complexity of the project; (ii) potential \ndelays in the release of government counterpart funds; and (iii) the lack of fully integrated systems \nfor tracking the vaccine distribution, including the use of manual systems at the district level to \nrecord the vaccine stock. The risk will be mitigated by (i) engaging additional financial staff to \nsupport the PMU; (ii) ensuring sound fixed asset, inventory, and vaccine stock management \nprocesses and systems are maintained and routine internal audits are conducted at all levels; (iii) \nincluding comprehensive financial management information in the quarterly progress reports to \nbe submitted to ADB; and (iv) National Audit Office conducting periodic performance audits on \nNDVP implementation in addition to annual project financial statements audits. \n \nF.  Procurement \n \n50.  The MOH and SPC are well-versed with the national procurement guidelines and PMU \nhas experience with ADB procurement practices under HSEP. Despite this, the risks in the \nprocurement of vaccines are inherently high risk. This is because of high global demand, scarcity, \nand  asymmetrical  buyer-seller  relationships.  The  project  will  also  improve  procurement \ntransparency by publishing procurement information on the HSEP website.  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n51.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProject  specific.
