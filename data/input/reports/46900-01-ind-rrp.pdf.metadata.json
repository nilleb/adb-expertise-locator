The  NSM \nenvisages  installed  solar  power  generation  capacity  of  2  gigawatts  (GW)  by  2013,  10  GW  by \n2017, and 20 GW by 2022. Through such projects, the NSM also envisages the development of \na  diversified  manufacturing  base  in  India  of  solar  power  components  for  the  region.  Under \nphase  1  of  the  NSM  (2010\u20132013),  NTPC  Vidyut  Vyapar  Nigam  Limited  (NVVN)\u2014the  nodal \nagency under the NSM for the procurement of solar power\u2014invited bids for the development of \n470  megawatts  (MW)  of  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP)  and  150  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic \ncapacity. Of the 60 companies that participated in the bid process for the CSP projects, seven \nwere  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  discount  offered  to  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission feed-in tariff for CSP projects. One of the successful bidders was RSTEPL, a 100% \nsubsidiary of Reliance Power Limited (RPL). \n \n3. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) was approached by RPL in October 2011 in regard \nto  financing  for  the  project.  From  initial  discussions  between  RPL  and  ADB,  ADB  viewed  that \nthe project possessed sound fundamentals, including the financial strength of the sponsor, high-\nquality project preparatory work, potential benefits for local manufacturing of solar components, \nand  a  strong  technology  partner.  The  project  is  the  largest  among  the  37  projects  being \ndeveloped  under  phase  1  of  the  NSM.  The  assistance  to  the  project  will  demonstrate  strong \nsupport for the government\u2019s NSM as well as for the further development of solar energy in the \nunderdeveloped  state  of  Rajasthan.  The  project  will  strongly  complement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \ninitiatives  in  solar  energy  in  India,  including  technical  assistance  to  the  nodal  ministry  for  the \nNSM,  regular  training  programs  on  solar  energy  for  financial  institutions,  and  the  $150  million \nsolar power generation guarantee facility supporting smaller solar power projects.1 This will be \nADB\u2019s first financing of a CSP project. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe project entails the construction of a 100 MW CSP generation plant near the village \n4. \nof Dhursar in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan state. The project site is 180 kilometers (km) west \nof the city of Jodhpur and 10 km from the Jodhpur\u2013Jaisalmer national highway (NH-114). The \nannual  direct  normal  irradiance2 at  the  project  site  is  estimated  to  be  2,071  kilowatt-hours  per \nsquare meter, one of the highest in the country. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Guarantee Facility \n\nfor Solar Power Generation in India. Manila (April). \n\n2   Direct  normal  irradiance  is  the  amount  of  solar  radiation  received  per  unit  area  by  a  surface  that  is  always  held \nperpendicular to the rays that come in a straight line from the direction of the sun at its current position in the sky, \nexcluding solar radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components in the sky. \n\n\f 2\n\nThe project will use compact linear fresnel reflector (CLFR) technology to capture solar \n5. \nenergy  and  convert  water  to  superheated  steam  through  multiple  solar  steam  generators \n(SSGs). The steam produced will be used to drive a steam turbine which will produce electricity. \nSunlight  is  reflected  onto  the  linear  SSGs  by  a  series  of  flat  reflectors  or  mirrors  arranged  in \nparallel rows. Based on the sun\u2019s exact position at any given time of the day, the position of the \nmirrors is adjusted through drive motors to reflect the sunlight onto a series of tubes that run the \nlength  of  the  SSGs.  Water  in  the  tubes  is  heated  by  the  sun\u2019s  rays  up  to  400\u00b0  Celsius  and \nconverted  into  saturated  and  superheated  steam.  The  project  consists  of  approximately  39 \nSSGs  each  producing  steam  independently.  Steam  leaving  the  SSG  tubes  is  collected  in  a \npiping system and transported to the steam turbine. \n \n6. \nThe electricity generated from the project will be evacuated from the project site to the \nexisting  220-kilovolt  (kV)  Dechu  substation  of  Rajasthan  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam  Limited,  the \nstate  transmission  company,  through  a  30-km  220-kV  double  circuit  transmission  line.  The \ntransmission line is currently under construction by Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited for a 40 \nMW solar photovoltaic plant adjacent to the project site. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n7. \nThe  borrower,  RSTEPL,  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  set  up  by  RPL  exclusively  to \ndevelop the project. RPL is a listed group company of the Reliance ADA Group, established to \ndevelop, construct, and operate power projects in India and abroad. The Reliance ADA Group is \none  of  India\u2019s  largest  business  conglomerates  with  a  strong  presence  in  the  energy, \ninfrastructure, telecommunications, media and entertainment, and financial services sectors. \n \n8. \nRPL  has  a  portfolio  of  33,440  MW  of  power  generation  capacity  in  various  stages  of \ndevelopment. The operational portfolio is 1,200 MW while 14,460 MW is under construction and \n17,780  MW  is  under  development.  Coal-fired  power  plants  (including  the  three  ultra-mega \npower projects\u2014Sasan, Tilaya, and Krishnapatnam) account for 61% of the total portfolio, gas-\nfired  plants comprise  25%,  and  hydropower  plants  represent  14%.  The project is its  first  solar \nthermal energy project.

In  addition,  as  one  of  the  first \nCSP  initiatives,  the  building  of  the  project  will  help  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  utility-scale \nCSP  projects  in  India  and  the  operational  performance  in  a  location  (Rajasthan)  where \nsubstantial solar power development is planned during 2012\u20132017. The project also promotes \nthe  efficient  use  of  indigenous  renewable  energy  resources  with  very  limited  emission  of \npollutants or greenhouse gases.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n11. \nThe project will demonstrate the viability of utility-scale private CSP generation in India \nby  generating  242,756  megawatt-hours  (MWh)4 of  clean  energy  per  annum  while  delivering \nadequate returns for the private sponsor. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  result  in  the  construction  and \ncommissioning  of  one  of  India\u2019s  first  utility-scale  CSP  plants  and  increase  solar  power \ngeneration capacity in the country by 100 MW.5 \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n13. \nThe  project  supports  two  of  the  five  core  operational  areas  of  Strategy  2020\u2014\ninfrastructure  and  environment. 6  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership \nstrategy  (CPS),  2009\u20132012.  One of  the  four strategy  pillars  of  the  CPS  is  to support  inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth through continued focus on infrastructure development \nand  enhanced  focus  on  renewable  energy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  one  key  outcome \nindicator of the CPS, which targets addition of at least 70 MW of solar power generation through \nADB assistance by 2012.7  \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy and the Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n\n14. \nUnder  its  Energy  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as  expansion  of  energy  access.  The  policy  states  that \nsupport  for  renewable  energy  projects  will  be  prioritized  and  broadened,  with  an  objective  of \ncreating a framework that makes investing in renewable energy commercially viable. The policy \nenvisages that, in the process of facilitating private investments in renewable energy, ADB will \n\n                                                 \n4  Average energy production per annum over the operational life of the project. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6  ADB.  2008.

The initiative seeks to stimulate solar power development \nin DMCs with the goals of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar \nenergy\u2019s  competitiveness  within  the  grid;  (ii)  exploiting  solar  radiation  resources  of  selected \nDMCs to serve their fast-growing electricity demand and utilize their greater availability of land \ncompared with most developed countries; and (iii) promoting the potential of DMCs to become \nglobal  and  regional  manufacturing  hubs  for  solar  technology  goods  and  equipment.  CLFR \ntechnology  employs  relatively  simple  equipment  (e.g.,  structural  steel  lattices,  steel  tubes,  flat \nmirrors, and drive motors), which can be manufactured locally. This development will generate \nthe  potential  for  local  manufacturing  of  such  components,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nobjectives  under  the  NSM.  In  turn,  it  will  reduce  the  cost  of  future  CSP  projects  in  India.  This \nstrategy is in line with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with ADB Operations \n\n16. \nThe  project  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s  current  initiatives  in  solar  energy  in  India.  In \nApril 2011, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the Solar Power Generation Guarantee Facility, \nwhich will issue partial credit guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million \n(or its equivalent in Indian rupees) in favor of foreign and local commercial financial institutions \nlending  to  solar  power  generation  projects  in  India.  The  facility  will  support  multiple  solar \ngeneration projects up to a maximum individual capacity of 25 MW under a solar power program \nwith the central or state governments. This facility will catalyze commercial lending and private \ninvestment  for  smaller  solar  generation  projects,  while  the  proposed  project  along  with  the \nDahanu  Solar  Power  Project9 (approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  in November  2011)  aims  to  catalyze \nprivate investment in larger solar generation projects with a capacity greater than 25 MW. The \nlending and guarantee program is complemented by technical assistance provided to the nodal \nministry  for  the  NSM,  and  a  capacity  building  and  training  program  for  commercial  financial \ninstitutions  to  better  understand  technical  risks  for  solar  power.  This  highlights  ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct  approach  to  promoting  private  investment  in  solar  energy  and  its  ability  to \ncustomize based on market needs and associated risks. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $414.5 million. \n\n17. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009.

These RPOs require distribution companies to purchase 0.25%\u20131.00% of \ntheir total electricity requirements from solar energy sources. Distribution companies \ncan use the bundled electricity purchased from NVVN to offset their solar RPOs. \n\nPrices for solar power sold under the NSM have been competitively bid as a discount \nto the feed-in tariffs established by the CERC for CSP projects. The CERC tariffs are \nevaluated and revised from time to time to take into account capital cost reductions and \nthe bid prices for those projects commissioned in early rounds of tendering. \n\n  \nRSTEPL has entered into a power purchase agreement with NVVN to sell 100% of the \noutput of the project for a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of Rs11.97 per kWh ($0.24 \nper kWh). NVVN, a 100% subsidiary of the NTPC (a majority state-owned entity), has \nbeen designated as a nodal agency under the NSM for the procurement of solar power. \nNVVN will bundle solar power purchased from the private solar power projects with \nunallocated power from NTPC\u2019s thermal power stations and sell this bundled power to \nthe state discoms. \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\nImplementation period \n\nConstruction of the project is expected to be completed in May 2013.

Over  450  MW  of  CLFR-based  CSP  projects  are \ncurrently  under  development  around  the  world,  of  which  only  16  MW  is  currently  operational. \nThe largest CLFR project currently in operation is AREVA Solar USA\u2019s 5 MW plant in California. \nA  30  MW  CLFR  project  is  scheduled  to  be  commissioned  in  Spain  in  March  2012.  Thus,  the \nlong-term performance of CLFR technology is not yet proven and the project will be subject to \nperformance  and  scale-up  risks.  However  CLFR  technology  is  much  less  complex  than  other \nCSP technologies as it does not involve the use of heat transfer fluids, heat exchangers, curved \nmirrors,  imported  absorption  tubes,  or  complex  tracking  systems.  The  performance  warranties \nprovided by AREVA Solar USA will mitigate this risk. \n \n23. \nOff-taker risk. RSTEPL will sell 100% of the output of the project to NVVN, a subsidiary \nof  NTPC  Limited  (a  majority  state-owned  enterprise)  at  a  fixed  tariff  of  Rs11.97  ($0.24)  per \nkilowatt-hour  for  25  years.  NVVN  will  bundle  solar  power  from  this  project  with  unallocated \nthermal  power  from  NTPC  and  sell  it  to  the  state  distribution  companies  through  a  separate \npower  supply  agreement.  Multiple  defaults  or  payment  delays  by  various  state  distribution \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ncompanies  could  make  it  difficult  for  NVVN  to  honor  its  obligations  under  the  power  purchase \nagreement with RSTEPL.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n24. \nSupply and installation risk. The construction period is expected to be 17 months. All \nmajor  contracts  have  been  executed  and  construction  preparatory  works  have  commenced. \nHowever, a delay in the commercial operations date will result in loss of revenue to the project. \nThe  schedule  liquidated  damages  specified  in  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \n(EPC) contract mitigate this risk.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n25. \nOperation  and  maintenance  risk. Areva Renewable Energies India Private Limited, a \n100%  subsidiary  of  Areva  Renouvelables  SAS  (France),  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) for the first 5 years. O&M for the plant will be primarily limited to ensuring \nadequate cleaning of the mirrors and receivers as well as routine and periodic maintenance of \nthe  steam  turbine.  The  comprehensive  performance  guarantees  specified  in  the  EPC  contract \nand the availability guarantees specified in the O&M contract mean that the residual O&M risk \nbeyond  5  years  is  not  considered  significant  after  operations  have  been  normalized.  After  5 \nyears, the O&M activities will likely be undertaken directly by RSTEPL. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nForeign  exchange  risk.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars,  but  the \n26. \nproject revenues will be in Indian rupees without any pass through of the foreign exchange risk. \nThe loan documentation will specify hedging requirements and/or sponsor support for mitigating \ncurrency fluctuations.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n27. \nInterconnection  risk.  The  project  will  be  connected  to  the  Dechu  substation  of \nRajasthan  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam  Limited  through  the  30  km  220  kV  transmission  line  being \nbuilt by Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited. A delay in construction of the transmission line will \nresult in loss of revenue for the project. Construction of the transmission line has commenced \nand is scheduled to be completed by March 2012. The project is scheduled to be completed by \nMay  2013.  Thus,  there  is  sufficient  margin  to  account  for  any  delay  in  construction  of  the \ntransmission line. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE  \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n28. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\ncommitment of RSTEPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nloan  documentation \n\n29. \nRSTEPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing international best practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe \nincludes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed loan is within the medium term country, industry, group, and single-project \n\n30. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n31. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),10 the Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed  assistance  to  RSTEPL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form \nand  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  ADB\u2019s \nBoard. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$103,000,000  to  Rajasthan  Sun  Technique  Energy  Private  Limited  for  the  Rajasthan \nConcentrating  Solar  Power  Project  in  India  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and \nas may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n\n \n5 March 2012\n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1966.
