The  Project  is  limited  to  the  resurfacing  of  existing \nroad pavements and has few environmental risks associated with \nit. An environmental impact assessment is not required. An initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  and  a \nsummary is in Appendix 12. Impacts during the implementation of \nthe  Project  have  been  reviewed  and  mitigation  measures  have \nbeen  integrated  into  the  project  design.  These  measures  will  be \nmanaged through the environmental management plan (EMP). \n \nThe Project will assist the Government of Cambodia with periodic \nmaintenance of the national and provincial roads administered by \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (the  MPWT  roads).  The \nProject  will  (i) assist  the  Government  in periodic  maintenance  of \nabout  950  kilometers  (km)  of  MPWT  roads;  and  (ii) help  to  build \ncapacity at MPWT to improve the management and maintenance \nof  its  roads  network  and  start  a  process  of  privatizing  MPWT\u2019s \nforce account units. \n \nThe institutional strengthening of MPWT will include supporting a \npermanent and dedicated road asset management office (RAMO) \nwithin the general department of works of MPWT. This office will \nbe  formally  established  before  loan  effectiveness.  RAMO  will  be \nresponsible  for  systematic  maintenance  planning  for  the  MPWT \nroads  and  will  support  and  train  MPWT  management  and  line \norganizations to become efficient road asset managers. \n \n\ni \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nSource \n\nthe \nWithout  a  periodic  road  maintenance  works  program, \nsignificant investment in rehabilitating MPWT\u2019s paved roads (more \nthan  $800  million  since  the  mid-1990s)  will  quickly  lose  value  as \ntraffic  and  environmental  effects  lead  to  deterioration.  The \nproposed periodic maintenance works program will help preserve \nMPWT  roads  that  are  in  a  maintainable  condition,  and  correct \ndeficiencies affecting the sustainability and safety of the network. \nIf the long-term sustainability of the MPWT roads is to be secured, \nthe institutional capacity of the ministry needs to be strengthened \nso  it  can  provide  effective  future  road  asset  management. \nPreserving  the  roads  will  prevent  travel  times  and  vehicle \noperating costs from increasing, and secure the accessibility that \nis essential for economic growth, particularly for the majority of the \npopulation  living  in  rural  areas.  It  will  also  improve  Cambodia\u2019s \nconnections with its neighbors.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  a  contribution  to  achieving  the \nlong-term  sustainability  of \nthe  MPWT  roads  by  preserving \nvulnerable parts of the road network and establishing a consistent \nand  prioritized  road  management  system  within  MPWT.  This  will \nassist  economic  growth  by  reducing  future  transport  costs  and \npreserving road connections. The outcome of the Project will be a \nmore sustainable road sector based on a sound network of MPWT \nroads and effective road asset management. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $58.35 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $6.28 million.  \n \n\nAsian Development Bank \nInternational Development Agency \nGovernment of Australiaa \nGovernment of Cambodia \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n6.00 \n30.00 \n4.80 \n17.55 \n\n 58.35 \n\n% \n\n 10.3 \n 51.4 \n 8.2 \n 30.1 \n\n100.0 \n\na  This amount includes ADB's administration fee, audit cost, bank charges and \nprovision  for  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  (if  any),  to  the  extent  that  these \nitems are not covered by the interest and investment income earned on this \ngrant, or any additional grant contribution by the Government of Australia. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\fLoan Amounts and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  special  drawing  rights \n(SDR)  3,761,000  (about  $6  million  equivalent)  to  be  provided  by \nADB  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. There will be \nan interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  International  Development \nAssociation  (IDA)  of \nthe  World  Bank  Group  will  provide \ncofinancing  for  the  Project  through  an  IDA  credit  of  $30  million \nand  the  Government  of  Australia  through  the  Australian  Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  will  provide  a  grant  for \nA$6  million  (about  $4.8  million  equivalent).  The  grant  from  the \nGovernment of Australia will be administered by ADB whereas the \nIDA  credit  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis  and  will  be \nadministered  by  IDA.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart \nfunding of $17.55 million equivalent (30.1%) of total Project cost. \n \nUntil 31 December 2013 \n \n30 June 2013 \n\n \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport \n \nThe MPWT will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project, and \nthe Directorate General of Public Works (DGPW) in MPWT will be \nthe  Implementing  Agency  (IA).  MPWT  has  extensive  experience \nof  implementing  externally  funded  projects.  The  Project  will  not \nestablish  a  separate  project  management  unit.  The  Minister  of \nMPWT will appoint a deputy director general from DGPW as a full-\ntime  project  director,  who  will  be  responsible \nfor  project \nsupervision  and  will  be  accountable  to  the  DGPW  director \ngeneral. DGPW will be responsible for day-to-day management of \nthe Project and for coordinating the work of the line organizations \nin  MPWT  including  RAMO.  DGPW  will  engage  and  direct  all \nconsultants, be responsible for procurement of works, and be the \nemployer  on  all  civil  works  contracts.  It  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  implementation  of  the  EMP  in  the  design  and \nconstruction stages. \n \nThe  existing  Interministerial  Committee  for  Coordinating  Road \nRepair  and  Maintenance  (ICCRRM)  will  act  as  the  steering \ncommittee  for  the  Project.  The  ICCRRM  is  coordinating  the \nMinistry of Finance (MEF) and MPWT in all matters pertaining to \nmaintenance  planning,  implementation  and  disbursement  for  the \nnational roads. \n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nimprove \n\nProcurement  of  all  ADB  and  AusAID  financed  works  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  DGPW  is  familiar  with  ADB \nprocurement requirements and has performed satisfactorily under \nprevious  ADB-funded  projects.  Procurement  of  civil  works \nfinanced  by  IDA  will  be  subject  to  IDA\u2019s  procurement  guidelines \nand procedures. \n \nDGPW  may  carry  out  advance  contracting  for  civil  works  to \naccelerate implementation. \n \nConsulting services financed by ADB and AusAID will be selected \nand recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting \nservices financed by IDA will be recruited using IDA\u2019s guidelines. \n \nDGPW may carry out advance recruitment for consulting services \nto accelerate implementation.  \n \nThe  Project's  economic  benefits  are  primarily  derived  from \nsavings in future vehicle operating costs that accrue because the \nproposed  periodic  maintenance  will \nroad  surface \nconditions  and  slow  their  future  deterioration.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, which was calculated \nis \nby  comparing  with-project  and  without-project  situations, \nestimated  at  97.0%,  showing  that  it  is  economically  viable. \nExtensive  sensitivity  testing  and  risk  analyses  show  that  there  is \nno risk that the EIRR would fall below the cut-off rate of 12%. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which \ninclude delays in implementation or poor technical quality of works \ncaused  by  the  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  MPWT, \ndelayed  counterpart  financing,  and  an  inability  to  maintain  the \nproject  roads  adequately  in  future.  These  risks  are  mitigated \nthrough the Project\u2019s technical advisory component. \n \nPreserving  the  MPWT  roads  will  perpetuate  adverse  social \nimpacts  from  roads,  such  as  traffic  accidents  and  spreading  of \nHIV/AIDS. To mitigate this, the supervision consulting services will \nundertake  road  safety  audits  and  fund  road  safety  awareness \ncampaigns under the national road safety action plan. IDA and the \nGovernment will finance an HIV/AIDS prevention campaign under \nthe Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  restore  and  maintain  existing  road  surfaces  and \nthere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement. \nHowever,  future  traffic  increases  will  require  extension  and \nwidening  of  the  project  roads.  ADB  technical  assistance  is \nto  prepare  a  new  resettlement \nassisting \nsubdecree  that  will  ensure  uniform  and  sufficient  resettlement  of \naffected  people  in  all  infrastructure  projects,  irrespective  of \n\nthe  Government \n\n\fimplementing  agency.  To  support \nfunding  source  and \nimplementation of this subdecree, the Project will provide funding \nfor training of officers at concerned ministries and agencies.  \n \n\n \n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f103  00'Eo\n\n107  00'Eo\n\nCAMBODIA\nROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT PROJECT\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\no\n14  00'N\n\nTHAILAND\n\no\n14  00'N\n\nPoipet\n\nSisophon\n\nSIEM  REAP\n\nPREAH   VIHEAR\n\nODDAR  MEANCHEY\n\nSamrong\n\nBANTEAY\nMEANCHEY\n\nMongkol Borey\n\nPAILIN\n\nPailin\n\nBattambang\n\nBATTAMBANG\n\nMoung Roessei\n\nSiem Reap\n\nTonle\nSap\n\nCheom Ksan\n\nTbeng Meanchey\n\nSiem Pang\n\nSTUNG\nTRENG\n\nStung Treng\n\nRATANAKIRI\n\nBanlung\n\nLumphat\n\n.\nR\n \ng\nn\no\nk\ne\nM\n\nKOMPONG\nTHOM\n\nKompong Thom\n\nSambor\n\nMONDULKIRI\n\nSen Monorom\n\nKRATIE\n\nSandan\n\nKratie\n\nChhlong\n\nSnuol\n\nPrek Kak\n\nSre Khtum\n\nPursat\n\nKrakor\n\nPURSAT\n\nKompong Chhnang\n\nKoh Kong\n\nKOMPONG\nSPEU\n\nKompong Speu\n\nKOH  KONG\n\nSre Ambel\n\nSdok\nKOMPONG\nCHHNANG\n\nKompong Cham\n\nPhuni Tonle Bet\n\nMemot\n\nKOMPONG\nCHAM\n\nKrek\n\nPHNOM PENH\n\nPrey Veng\n\nTakmau\nKANDAL\n\nPREY\nVENG\n\nSVAY\nRIENG\n\nKompong\nTrabek\n\nSvay Rieng\n\nKaaong\n\nAngtassom\n\nTakeo\n\nKAMPOT\n\nTAKEO\n\nVeal Renh\n\nKampot\n\n Tani\n\nKep\n\nTuk Meas\n\nB\n\na\n\ns\n\ns\n\na\n\nc\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nKEP\n\nSihanoukville\n\nSIHANOUKVILLE\n\nMekong R.\n\nVIET    NAM\n\nN\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\no\n11  00'N\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nExisting Toll Road\n\nFirst Year Program Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\no\n11  00'N\n\n0\n7\n-\n3\n7\n6\n6\n \nH\nR\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nSouth  China  Sea\n\n103  00'Eo\n\n107  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i) a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Road  Asset  Management  Project  and  (ii)  proposed \nadministration  of  grant  from  the  Government  of  Australia  for  the  Project.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe principal mode for the movement of goods and people in Cambodia is by road. The \n2. \nCambodian  road  network  covers  about  39,400  kilometers  (km)  and  includes  seven  national \nroads  (NRs  1\u20137),  which  are  considered  the  primary  highways  and  have  a  combined  length  of \nabout 4,800 km, and provincial roads, which are considered the secondary highways and have \na  combined  length  of  6,600  km.  The  management  of  the  road  network  is  split  between  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT),  which  is  responsible  for  about  11,400  km  of \nnational and provincial roads (the MPWT roads) and the Ministry for Rural Development, which \nis  responsible  for  about  28,000  km  of  rural  roads.  In  addition,  MPWT  also  administers  certain \nminor  roads  with  relatively  high  traffic  loads,  currently  defined  as  more  than  300  vehicles  per \nday, on behalf of the Ministry of Rural Development. Some provincial and most rural roads are \nin  a  poor  condition  and  parts  of  the  country  are  effectively  isolated  during  the  wet  season. \nCross-border traffic in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is still in its infancy but Cambodia \nand its neighbors are making concerted efforts to promote and ease such traffic by adopting the \nGMS  road  traffic  cross-border  agreement1 and  developing  border  crossing  infrastructure  and \naccess roads. All of Cambodia\u2019s national roads except for NR 2 form part of either the southern \ncorridor  of  the  GMS,2 which  connects  Bangkok  via  Cambodia  to  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and  other \ncenters  in  southern  Viet  Nam,  or  the  central  corridor  which  connects  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic to the port in Sihanoukville.3 \n\n3. \nBy the early 1990s, years of civil strife had led to widespread and severe deterioration of \nCambodia\u2019s  road  infrastructure.  In  1992,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the \nSpecial Rehabilitation Assistance Loan4 to support the country\u2019s rehabilitation of critical physical \nand social infrastructure. The project focused on rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, which \nwas recognized as a serious constraint on the economic development and physical integration \nof  the  country.  The  Government  has  since  focused  road  investment  on  rehabilitating  the  core \nnational roads to stimulate sustainable economic recovery. Rehabilitation of the primary national \nroads  has  been  implemented  over  the  last  15  years  with  substantial  support  from  ADB  and \nother development partners and is now nearing completion. \n\nThe  length  of  the  rehabilitated  national  road  network  is  now  about  2,700  km.  The \n4. \nrehabilitated  national  roads  connect  the  major  population  centers  and  Cambodia  with  its \nneighbors. The asset value of the network is about $800 million but the network is deteriorating \nrapidly  because  of  lack  of  adequate  road  maintenance  combined  with  rapidly  growing  traffic, \n\n                                                 \n \n1  ADB.  2004.  Implementation  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement.  Manila \n\n(approved in March 2004 for $800,000) \n\n2  The roads involved are NRs 1 and 5, parts of NRs 3 and 6, and provincial roads 33 and 48. \n3  The roads involved are NRs 4 and 7. \n4  ADB. 1992. Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project. Manila \n\n(approved in November 1992 for $67.7 million). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npoor  road  construction  standards,  and  design  and  construction  deficiencies.  This  means  that \nlarge parts of the investment in rehabilitating the national roads could be lost within the next 5\u20136 \nyears  unless  MPWT\u2019s  road  asset  preservation  works  program  is  significantly  expanded  and \naccelerated. \n\nInadequate road maintenance is primarily due to a shortage of financial resources,5 poor \n5. \norganization  of  road  management,  and  weak  technical  capacity.  Shortage  of  funds  for  road \nmaintenance  is  a  common  problem  in  least  developed  countries.  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  and \nsocial  development  requires  a  minimum  network  of  trafficable  roads  but  built  or  rehabilitated \nroads  are  often  not  maintained  because  economic  activity  is  low  and  traffic  minimal  (with  the \nresult that revenues from fuel and other road user taxes are insufficient to finance the upkeep of \nthe  network).  This  is  particularly  so in  Cambodia,  where  population  densities  and  traffic  levels \nare  low,  but  roads  are  relatively  long.  This  low  revenue-generating  capacity  is  equally  true  in \nmany other subsectors of the economy so there is limited scope for using domestic resources to \nsubsidize the roads until the economy and the associated traffic-related revenues have caught \nup.  Other  consequences  of  this  situation  include  a  limited  capacity  for  planning  and \nimplementing road maintenance and a scarcity of capable domestic road works contractors who \ncould  undertake  maintenance  works  and  who  would  require  a  reliable  and  reasonably \npredictable market for their services. \n\n6. \nThis  situation  will  change  relatively  quickly  given  Cambodia\u2019s  strong  and  stable \neconomic growth\u2014averaging about 8.1% per year over the last 10 years. In recent years, the \nGovernment\u2019s increasing budget allocations for road maintenance make it likely that sustainable \nroad  financing  may  be  achievable  within  the  next  5\u20136  years.  The  proposed  Project  seeks  to \nspan this interim period by injecting supplementary funding that will enable MPWT to preserve \nthe  rehabilitated  network  until  adequate  national  funding  becomes  available,  and  to  equip \nMPWT  to  manage  its  road  assets  effectively  when  such  national  funding  does  become \navailable.  The  Project  will  do  this  by:  (i) providing  supplementary  periodic  maintenance;  and \n(ii) assisting  MPWT  with  internal  restructuring,  including  supporting  the  development  of  a \npermanent  Road  Asset  Management  Office  (RAMO).  In  due  course  RAMO  would  be \nresponsible for planning the maintenance of the MPWT roads and would become MPWT\u2019s road \nasset manager. It would advise MPWT on the process of gradually privatizing its force account \nunits. This process will reallocate human and physical resources to the private sector while, at \nthe  same  time,  help  to  create  a  relatively  predictable  captive  market  for  domestic  road \ncontractors. \n\n7. \nDuring preparation of the Project, MPWT requested support and advice on the possibility \nof setting up road toll collection on selected high-traffic volume highways, e.g., NR 1, NR 5, and \nNR  6,  to  generate  additional  sources  of  revenue  for  road  maintenance.  A  study  carried  out \nunder  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)6 indicated  that  there  is  potential  for \ngenerating  additional  revenue  from  road  tolls.  Once  road  maintenance  is  in  place  and,  if \n\n                                                 \n \n5  Road  maintenance  is  partially  financed  from  the  Fund  for  Road  Repair  and  Maintenance,  which  is  a  road  fund \nestablished by the Government in 2000 and financed by a surcharge on fuel. The road fund\u2019s revenue potential is \nconstrained by fuel prices in Thailand and Viet Nam, which are significantly lower than in Cambodia. As a result, \nthere is a danger that raising fuel taxation rates in Cambodia would lead to more fuel smuggling, which is already \nsubstantial, and that this would undercut the fiscal efficacy of the tax rate increase. \n\n6   ADB.  2006.  Preparing  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Development  and  Maintenance  Project,  Manila  (approved  in \n\nNovember 2006 for $1,000,000). \n\n\frequested  by  Government,  ADB  will  consider  providing  an  advisory  TA  outside  this  Project  to \ndevelop an action plan to establish road toll collection on selected road sections.7 \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nDuring rehabilitation of the MPWT roads, the Government and its development partners \nfocused  on  rehabilitating  the  maximum  possible  length  of  the  national  roads  in  the  shortest \npossible time. Since at the time most of these roads were barely if at all passable, a quick and \nsimple  approach  to  restoring  the  network  was  essential  for  an  early  restoration  of  economic \nactivity.  Faced  with  limited  government  budgets  and  initially  with  very  low  traffic  levels,  most \nrehabilitation projects elected to adopt low construction standards; often with a design life of 10 \nyears or less. Paving of shoulders was omitted in some projects to further stretch budgets. This \nenabled  rapid  rehabilitation  of  the  core  network  but  came  at  the  expense  of  heavier  future \nmaintenance requirements, the effects of which must now be addressed. \n\n9. \nTraffic is increasing rapidly in Cambodia, in step with rehabilitation of the road network \nand  high  and  stable  economic  growth.  The  precise  magnitude  of  traffic  growth  cannot  be \ndetermined in the absence of comprehensive traffic counts over time but indicators such as the \ngrowth in petrol imports (averaging 15.4% per annum between 2002 and 2005), the growth in \nthe  fleet  of  registered  motor  vehicles  (averaging  19.3%  per  annum  between  2004  and  2006), \nand  rapid  economic  growth  indicate  that  traffic  has  probably  grown  at  an  average  about  10% \nper annum in recent years, equivalent to doubling every 7 years. This is much faster than had \nbeen assumed when the road rehabilitation projects were prepared. As the economy grows, this \nrate  of  traffic  growth  will  be  maintained,  if  not  exceeded.  The  wear  and  tear  from  higher  than \nexpected  traffic  growth  has  decreased  the  already  short  design  life  of  the  roads  and  thereby \naccelerated \ninstances,  pavement \nstrengthening.  The  rehabilitated  roads  are  now  5\u20136  years  old  and  periodic  maintenance  is \nbecoming urgent if they are to remain usable, and if the investment in their rehabilitation is not \nto be lost. \n\nfor  periodic  maintenance  and, \n\nthe  need \n\nin  many \n\nIn  2002,  an  ADB  transport  sector  strategy  study8 for  Cambodia  noted  that,  although \n10. \nCambodia\u2019s fuel taxes are high compared with those of its neighbors, road maintenance could \nnot be fully funded from existing road user revenues and would need to be subsidized from the \ngeneral  budget.  The  study  noted  that  the  shortfall  was  temporary  and  would  eventually \ndisappear because of the combined effect of a growth in traffic (which would increase road user \nrevenues),  and  falling  road  repair  requirements  (because  of  the  rehabilitation  of  the  network). \nThe study predicted that a balance between funding and requirements might be attained around \n2010\u20132011. Faster traffic growth has helped accelerate road revenues but this has at the same \ntime accelerated maintenance needs, which, together with increasing labor and material costs, \nhave outpaced the increase in revenues. As a result, it now seems likely that sustainable road \nmaintenance funding might be attained around 2013\u20132014.9 General budget funds cannot cover \nthe shortfall in road maintenance funding without breaking the existing regime of fiscal prudence \npursued by the Government. Interim supplementary funding is therefore required to secure the \nroad  network  in  the  medium  term,  until  revenues  from  the  road  transport  sector  become \nsufficient to fully meet road maintenance requirements. \n\n                                                 \n \n7  Road users would be unwilling to pay tolls to use roads that are in poor condition and adequate road maintenance \n\nmust therefore be in place through the Project before implementation of road tolls can be considered. \n\n8  ADB. 2001. Transport Sector Strategy Study, Manila (approved in April 2001 for $850,000). \n9  Source: ADB staff estimate based on an update of the analysis in the transport sector strategy study. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fUntil  recently,  expenditures  on  road  maintenance  were  minimal  because  (i) public \n11. \nfunding available for road maintenance was inadequate, (ii) the institutional capacity of MPWT \nto  plan  and  implement  road  maintenance  was  (and  remains)  weak;  and  (iii) cooperation \nbetween  MPWT  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  of  Finance  (MEF),  which  is  funding  road \nmaintenance,  was  not  well-structured.  To  address  these  deficiencies,  and  the  last  point  in \nparticular, in 2005 the Government established an interministerial committee for road repair and \nmaintenance  (ICCRRM),  consisting  of  representatives  of  MEF  and  MPWT.  ICCRRM  is \ndesigned to implement effective road maintenance financing and implementation systems. As a \nresult, outlays for routine maintenance and repairs have accelerated sharply, partly because of  \nincreasing Government revenues from road user taxes and partly because of the streamlining of \nplanning and disbursement procedures. For 2007, the national budget allocated $25.6 million for \nroad  works,  nearly  all  of  which  is  to  be  spent  on  the  national  highways.  Of  this  amount, \n$5.6 million was allocated for routine maintenance and about $10 million for repairs. Spending \non  provincial  roads  remains  minimal  and  funding  of  an  effective  periodic  maintenance  works \nprogram,  which  is  essential  for  the long-term  sustainability  of  the  MPWT  roads, is  still  beyond \nGovernment\u2019s means. \n\n12. \nThe  $10  million  for  repairs  is  mostly  being  spent  on  repairing  pavements  that  have \ndeveloped  premature  defects.  There  are  two  main  causes  of  these  defects:  inadequate \npavement  design  for  the  climatic  and  hydrological  conditions  in  Cambodia,  and  poor \nconstruction practices. An example of inadequate design is the use of unpaved earth shoulders \nto  save  money,  despite  the  recurrent  flooding  and  high  precipitation  in  Cambodia  and  the \nconsequent risk of pavement failure due to hydraulic pressure.10 Examples of poor construction \npractices  include  uneven  application  of  spray  seals  because  of  badly  configured  spraying \nequipment  and  pavements  that  are  of  uneven  thickness  or  thinner  than  designed,  caused  by \npoor workmanship and insufficient supervision and quality control. This reflects weak technical \nskills on the part of the contractors and MPWT. Securing the long-term sustainability of the road \nnetwork will require adequate construction standards to be enforced and comprehensive works \nsupervision and quality control systems to be established in MPWT. \n\n13.  While  the  road  maintenance  effort  has  improved  considerably  in  Cambodia  in  2005\u2013\n2007,  its  effectiveness  remains  low.  This  is  partly  because  of  weak  capacity  to  monitor  road \nconditions  and  prioritize  maintenance  works  within  MPWT,  but  also  because  MPWT  lacks  the \ndata  and  expertise  to  prove  its  point,  so  selection  and  prioritization  is  often  done  outside  the \nministry,  by  provincial  governments  and  by  other  ministries.  As  a  result,  in  effect MPWT  is  an \nadministrator of day-to-day operations but not the road manager or the center of road expertise \nwith the final word on which actions should be undertaken in the subsector. A comprehensive \nand prioritized road maintenance planning system needs to be set up in MPWT to enable it to \neffectively manage its road network. \n\n14. \nThe Project does not in itself entail social or environmental risks but the rapid growth in \ntraffic does have social costs that should be addressed. Cambodia has now one of the highest \nincidences of road accidents in the world and, in 2006, an average of four people a day were \nkilled and more than 100 injured on the roads. The road accident incidence in that year was 18 \n\n                                                 \n \n10   Hydraulic  pressure  damage  is  caused by  heavy  traffic  on  a  soaked  pavement.  Moving  wheel  loads \nimpart  considerable  and  sudden  pressure  on  water  on  a  soaked  road  pavement,  which  forces  the \nwater  into  the  road  fabric  and  breaks  it  up.  During  floods  or  heavy  rains,  water  seeps  into  the \npavement from the road edges. With a paved shoulder, it is the shoulder that gets soaked which is a \nlesser concern since it does not carry regular traffic. Without the paved shoulder, it is the edge of the \ncarriageway that gets soaked with the result that the pavement gets damaged in the outer wheel path \nwhere moving wheel loads and soaking intersect. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\ffatalities per 10,000 vehicles, a 50% increase over the 2000 figure. By comparison, in Thailand \nthere were 6.5 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 2005. At the Government\u2019s request, the Project \nincludes  an  allocation  to  fund  implementation  of  parts  of  the  national  road  safety  action  plan. \nAnother  persistent  issue  is  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  for  which  road  transport  is  a  recognized \nvector.  IDA  will  be  funding  a  project  component  that  addresses  this.  Finally,  social  issues  will \narise  from  the  need,  in  the  near  future,  to  expand  the  network  and  widen  existing  roads  to \naccommodate  the  growing  traffic  demand.  Large  investments  will  be  required  for  future \ninfrastructure development, which will need to be funded from many sources. The Government, \nwith assistance from ADB, is formulating an involuntary resettlement subdecree11 that will offer \nadequate  and  timely  compensation  to  affected  people  in  all  subsectors  irrespective  of  funding \nsource and implementing agency. The subdecree is expected to be approved early in 2008. In \nresponse to the Government\u2019s request, the Project includes an allocation to help implementing \nthe  subdecree  by  funding  training  in  affected  ministries  and  agencies,  including  MPWT  and \nMEF. \n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Cambodia\u2019s  road  subsector  has  emphasized  restoration  of  the \nnational road network in order to provide safe and economical travel between the main centers \nof population and economic activity, and to provide reliable land transport links to neighboring \ncountries. The strategy has focused on road infrastructure rehabilitation and the developing the \ninstitutional capacity to plan, manage, and maintain the transport system. \n\n16. \nIn  line  with  the  priorities  and  strategies  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular \nStrategy, ADB\u2019s overarching goal is sustainable poverty reduction. The Government\u2019s strategy \nfocuses  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i) broad-based  economic  growth  through  investment  in \nphysical  infrastructure,  development  of  the  financial  sector,  support  for  greater  regional \nintegration,  sustainable  development  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  investments \nin  agriculture  and  irrigation;  (ii) inclusive  social  development  through  basic  education, \nempowering vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic minorities, control of communicable \ndiseases,  provision  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  and  community-based \nsustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin;  and \n(iii) good  governance,  through  improvements  in  public  financial  management  to  enhance  the \ndevelopment  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures,  and  decentralization  and  deconcentration \ninitiatives to strengthen local participation in government, and improve public service delivery. \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n17. \nCambodia\u2019s road subsector has in recent years received assistance from ADB and the \nWorld  Bank  and  the  governments  of  Australia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Most  of  the  assistance  has  been  directed  to \nrestoring a basic level of access to as much of the country as possible through rehabilitation of \nthe  MPWT  roads,  including  major  programs  for  construction  of  bridges  that  were  damaged  or \ndestroyed by conflict or neglect. ADB, the World Bank and the Government of Japan have also \nprovided significant technical assistance to strengthen MPWT and other ministries and agencies \ninvolved in the roads subsector. A list of external assistance to the subsector is in Appendix 3. \nADB has provided loans for six transport projects, with three focusing on the road network. \n\n                                                 \n \n11  ADB.  2004.  Enhancing  the  Resettlement  Legal  Framework  and  Institutional  Capacity.  Manila  (approved  in \n\nDecember 2004 for $400,000). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n18. \nThe main lesson learned in the road subsector is that when projects are designed and \nimplemented  they  have  to  take  into  account,  and  actively  address,  MPWT\u2019s  institutional  and \nfinancing deficiencies. There need to be more effective network planning and road maintenance \nmechanisms that lead to better road design, construction and maintenance; more involvement \nby private sector interests, including the development of a domestic contracting industry; better \nprocedures  for  procurement  and  tendering  documentation,  financial  management,  and \nperformance  monitoring;  and  standardization  of  road  designs,  especially  pavement  design. \nSince it is likely that there will be more outsourcing of works, contract management will have to \nbe  significantly  improved  and  MPWT  officials  and  contractors  trained.  MPWT  needs  to  make \nmore  effort  to  retrain  staff  for  effective  project  supervision.  Enforcement  of  truck  overloading \npolicies,  roadworthiness  inspection,  collection  of  penalties,  and  road  safety  awareness  and \ndriver training all need to be strengthened. \n\n19. \nAnother  lesson  is  that  national  design  standards  must  be  complied  with  to  ensure  that \nroad  designs  are  adequate  for  the  prevailing  conditions,  even  when  funding  levels  are  tight. \nClose quality control and supervision must be in place to ensure that the desired level of quality \nis achieved at all stages from project design through to construction. \n\n20. \nThe  Government  of  Japan  is  providing  technical  assistance  to  MPWT  to  address  a \nnumber  of  these  issues,  including  establishing  axle  load  control  and  enforcement,  developing \nroad  maintenance  guidelines,  establishing  regular  road  condition  monitoring,  and  outsourcing \nroutine maintenance to the private sector. The Project will use the road maintenance guidelines \nand other outputs of this technical assistance to address issues that have not been covered so \nfar.  It  will  focus  on  bridging  the  temporary  funding  gap  for  periodic  road  maintenance  and  on \nhelping MPWT develop an efficient road asset management organization that can cope with the \nneeds of the road network. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  proposed  Road  Asset  Management  Project  will  help  to  preserve  the  rehabilitated \n21. \nand  maintainable  national  roads  until  adequate  national  funds  become  available  for  their \nupkeep. The impact will be the preservation of the MPWT roads so they can continue to support \nfuture  economic  development.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nMPWT  roads  by  establishing  a  consistent  and  prioritized  road  management  system  at  MPWT \nthat will allow it to make future road maintenance allocations more effectively. The Project will \nachieve  this  by  assisting  MPWT  with  (i)  periodic  maintenance  of  the  MPWT  roads; \n(ii) establishing and mainstreaming RAMO\u2019s capacity to undertake systematic road maintenance \nplanning  for  the  MPWT  roads;  and  (iii) providing  institutional  and  management  support  and \ntraining  to  MPWT  to  strengthen  its  road  management  and  quality  assurance  capacity  at  all \nlevels and to start a process of privatizing its force account units. The outcome will be a more \nsustainable road sector based on a sound MPWT network and sustained road maintenance. \n\n22. \nThe  Project  will  provide  periodic  maintenance  for  about  950  km  of  the  MPWT  roads, \nthereby  helping  to  cover  the  gap  between  road  maintenance  requirements  and  available \nresources.  It  will  develop  the  road  asset  management  capacity  of  MPWT  to  enable  it  to \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n\feffectively carry out road maintenance and road asset management. To achieve these outputs, \nthe Project will be implemented as two related components. \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Road Maintenance \n\nThis  component  encompasses  two  activities:  (i) the  periodic  maintenance  works,  and \n\n23. \n(ii) support to the implementing agency (IA) in managing and implementing these works. \n\n24. \nAn  indicative  annual  works  program  has  been  prepared  for  the  periodic  maintenance \nworks under the Project. The planned works are reseals, associated preparatory works such as \ncrack  and  pothole  repairs,  and  ancillary  works  such  as  shoulder  reinstatement,  line  work,  and \ninstallation  of  road  signs  on  about  950  km  of  the  MPWT  roads.  Shoulder  reconstruction  and \nsealing is not normally considered part of periodic maintenance but where necessary to secure \nthe  integrity  of  the  network,  up  to  20%  of  the  annual  works  cost  may  be  used  for  this.  The \nProject  will  not  implement  any  works  that  would  require  resettlement.  Force  account  units  will \nnot be employed for project works. All works performed under the Project will be implemented \nby private contractors. Details of the proposed civil works are in Appendix 4. \n\n25. \nThe proposed first-year works program is firm but those for the subsequent 4 years are \nfor  planning  purposes  only.  RAMO  will  select  road  sections  for  periodic  maintenance  in  these \nyears,  based  on  regular  monitoring  of  their  condition.  The  condition  of  the  network  will  be \naffected  by  with  the  amount  of  traffic  on  the  individual  roads,  the  impact  of  maintenance \nactivities  undertaken  outside  the  Project,  and  future  events,  such  as  larger  than  normal \nseasonal  floods.  The  ADB  loan  and  the  AusAID  grant  will  in  the  first-year  works  program  on \nNR 5 from km 3.9 to Kampong Chhnang western city limit. In subsequent years it is anticipated \nthat  ADB  and  AusAID  will  finance  periodic  maintenance  of  NR  5  from  Kampong  Chhnang  to \nPursat. \n\n26. \nImplementation  support  to  DGPW  encompasses  (i) a  project  implementation  advisor \nwho  will  assist  DGPW  with  implementing  the  Project,  (ii) works  supervision,  (iii) a  short-term \nconsultant  to  assist  DGPW  prepare  the  first-year  work  program,  encompassing  contracting  of \ncivil  works  and  contracting  of  consulting  services,  (iv) an  intermittent  consultant  to  perform \nregular  independent  technical  audits,  and  (v) independent  financial  audits  of  the  project \naccounts. The ADB loan and the AusAID grant will finance the short-term consultant preparing \nthe first-year program and the technical audit consultant. IDA will finance the remainder of the \nsupport for management and implementation of the Project. \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Capacity Development \n\n27. \nUnder  this  component  the  Project  will  (i) strengthen  MPWT\u2019s  road  management \nprocesses,  systems  and  staff  capacity  to  undertake  effective  road  asset  management  and \nprivatize five to six of MPWT\u2019s force account units; and (ii) provide financial support to general \nprograms aimed at mitigating negative impacts of road traffic. \n\n28. \nTo strengthen MPWT\u2019s road management capacity, the Project will help to develop the \ncapacity  of  RAMO  to:  report  to  the  Directorate  General  of  Public  Works  (DGPW)  on  the \ncondition  and  performance  of  road  network  assets,  recommend  maintenance  strategies  to \noptimize  returns  on  investment,  prioritize  road  candidates  for  periodic  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation,  and  prepare  annual  and  3-year  rolling  budgets  for  road  maintenance.  RAMO\u2019s \nfunctions will include: (i) collection of road asset data on the condition of the roads, the amount \nof  traffic,  and  road  users\u2019  vehicle  operating  costs;  (ii) data  processing  using  the  road \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement  decision  support  (RMDS) 12 system  to  generate  strategic  analysis,  prepare  the \nannual  maintenance  works  program,  perform  project  evaluation,  and  assess  overall  network \nperformance; and (iii) reporting on the condition of the MPWT roads, the effectiveness of road \nmaintenance and the recommended annual works programs. The main output will be MPWT\u2019s \nannual road maintenance works program and budget. RAMO will be formally established before \nloan effectiveness. \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  provide  advice  to  strengthen  MPWT's  organization  and  management, \nstrengthen  MPWT\u2019s  technical  capacity  for  road  management,  enhance  the  private  sector\u2019s \ncapacity  to  undertake  road  maintenance  works  and  ensure  adequate  quality  of  such  works.  It \nwill also help MPWT start privatizing force account units. It will support independent monitoring \nand evaluation of project benefits, and implementation of an HIV/AIDS awareness program. \n\nThe  Project  will  fund  implementation  of  parts  of  the  Government\u2019s  national  road  safety \n30. \naction  plan and  of  the  draft  resettlement  decree  (the  decree  is  currently  being  developed  with \nsupport from ADB, which is funding training of officials in the line ministries and provinces). IDA \nis proposing to fund a merit-based pay program13 in MPWT. \n\n31. \nADB  and  AusAID  will  finance  (i) independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project \nbenefits, (ii) parts of the national road safety action plan, and (iii) resettlement training. IDA will \nfinance  the  remainder  of  the  capacity  development  component  and  the  proposed  merit-based \npay program in MPWT. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPrivatization  of  five  to  six  of  MPWT\u2019s  force  account  units  will  help  create  a  responsive \n32. \ncontracting  industry  that  can  undertake  future  road  works  effectively.  It  will  reduce  MPWT\u2019s \nreliance on force account work.14  \n\n33. \n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $58.35 million (Table 1 and Appendix 5). \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nE.  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n34. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in the amount of SDR 3,761,000 \n(about $6 million equivalent)  from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to cover about 10.3% of the \nentire project cost. The loan will have a term of 32 years and a grace period of 8 years. There \nwill  be  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. AusAID intends to provide a grant of \nA$6 million (about $4.8 million equivalent). The Government of Australia financing, if approved, \nwill be provided as joint cofinancing and will be administered by ADB. IDA intends to cofinance \nthe Project by providing a credit of $30 million. The IDA credit, if approved, will be provided as \nparallel  cofinancing  and  will  be  administered  by  IDA.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  will \ncontribute about $17.55 million equivalent (30.1% of total costs) to cover the remaining project \n\n                                                 \n \n12 The RMDS was developed with funding from the World Bank and is now being updated and extended to cover all \n\nphases of road maintenance. \n\n13 Merit-based pay aims to reward the work ethic and effectiveness of government employees. It is a joint initiative of \n\nthe Government and its development partners, including ADB and the World Bank. \n\n14 The  legal  basis  for  the  privatization  of  MPWT\u2019s  force  account  units  already  exists  in  the  form  of  the  Financial \n\nManagement Law, 1995. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fcosts,  inclusive  of  part  of  works,  all  local  taxes  and  duties  and  project  management.  The \nProject\u2019s financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n\n35. \nADB typically seeks Board approval for the administration of grant and loan funds from \ncofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. In the case of the proposed grant \nfunding from AusAID, the expected approval will be on or before 31 January 2008. To facilitate \nproject  implementation,  the  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the  administration  of  the  proposed \ngrant in an amount not exceeding A$6 million (about $4.8 million equivalent) from AusAID in the \nevent that it is not confirmed before the date of Board approval. Approval from the cofinancier \nwill  be  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  standard  reporting  procedures.  If  the \nGovernment of Australia does not approve the grant financing, the portion that would have been \nfinanced  by  AusAID  will  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the  Government  of \nCambodia  may  make  alternative  arrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  cover  the  funding \nshortfall. \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimate  \n($ million) \n\nImplementation Consultants \n   a.

The cofinanciers will fund about 82% of works cost in the first year and only \nabout 48% in the last year. The intended duration of the Project is 5 years, thus the Government \nand  its  co-financiers  will  provide  an  average  of  about  $10  million  per  year  for  periodic  road \nmaintenance and consulting services. The indicative cost allocation for works over time and the \nindicative variable disbursement rates are in Appendix 5. \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n37.  MPWT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \ntechnical supervision and execution of the Project. DGPW will be the IA and will be responsible \nfor  the  direct  supervision  and  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project.  No  separate  project \nmanagement unit will be established. The director general for public works will appoint a deputy \ndirector general for public works to act as project director for the Project. The project director will \n(i) coordinate the work of the line organizations in MPWT, including RAMO; (ii) provide overall \nworks  supervision,  (iii) carry  out  a  public  awareness  campaign  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking, (iv) monitor and supervise all project management activities, (v) engage consultants \nand  carry  out  procurement,  (vi)  organize  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  (vii)  prepare \nproject progress and project completion reports to be submitted to an Interministerial Committee \nfor  Coordinating  Road  Repair  and  Maintenance  (ICCRRM),  ADB,  AusAID,  and  the  IDA;  and \n(viii) ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  resettlement,  environment,  and \nother  safeguard  policies.  The  project  director  will  receive  support  from  other  DGPW  staff  and \nthe implementation support consultants. \n\n38.  MPWT has substantial experience implementing ADB and World Bank projects as well \nas projects funded through bilateral assistance. It has performed satisfactorily in previous ADB \nprojects. The Project will be overseen by the ICCRRM which will act as the steering committee \nfor the Project. \n\n39. \nFunding  from  the  cofinanciers  will  be  subject  to  independent  financial  audit,  and  to \nsupervision and approval of claims by a construction supervision consultant engaged under the \nProject.  ADB,  AusAID,  and  IDA  have  agreed  that  they  will  seek  to  harmonize  their  reporting \nrequirements  (such  as  financial  and  technical  audit  reports,  progress  reports  and  monitoring \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\freports) to enable the MPWT to produce single harmonized versions of such reports acceptable \nto all cofinanciers. \n\nThe  implementation  period  for  the  Project  will  be  about  5  years  to  June  2013.  The \n\n40. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nThe  civil  works,  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  and  the  AusAID \ngrant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Procurement financed by IDA will be undertaken using IDA procedures and \nbe  through  an  independent  international  procurement  agent.  Based  on  the  current  state  of \nMPWT roads, two contract packages have been identified for ADB\u2019s portion of the civil works. \nHowever,  depending  on  the  physical  condition  of  MPWT  roads  from  2009,  the  civil  works \npackages  for  both  the  ADB-  and  AusAID-financed  portion  and  the  IDA-financed  portion  of  the \nProject are subject to change. \n\n42. \n Procurement  for  works  contracts  greater  than  $1  million  will  be  through  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) and for works less than $1 million through national competitive bidding \n(NCB). Procurement of  goods for contracts greater than $500,000 will be  through ICB  and  for \ngoods  less  than  $500,000  through  NCB.  Goods  and  services  for  less  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured using shopping procedures. Bid documents for civil works will be prepared for single-\nstage  two-envelope  bids.  The  conditions  of  the  environmental  management  plan  will  be \nreflected in the bidding and contract documents. \n\n43. \nA procurement plan for the first year of project implementation has been prepared. The \nprocurement  plan  outlines  (i)  the  contracts  for  ADB-financed  civil  works,  (ii)  the  proposed \nmethod of procurement of goods and works financed by ADB and (iii) the related ADB review \nprocedures. MPWT will update the procurement plan during the Project. The procurement plan, \nprocurement procedures, and details of proposed contract packages for the ADB- and AusAID-\nfinanced portion of the Project are set out in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nConsultants for the ADB- and AusAID-funded portion of the Project will be recruited by \nMPWT  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Individual consultants will be recruited under two contracts: (i) an individual \nconsultant  will  prepare  the  2008\u20132009  works  program  and  help  MPWT  to  procure  contracting \nservices;  and  (ii) a  technical  audit  consultant  will  ensure  quality  control  of  the  works \nimplemented.  The  total  input  of  consultants  for  the  ADB  and  AusAID  portion  of  the  Project  is \nestimated  at  12  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  20  person-months  of  national \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. \n\nEarly in 2008, MPWT will start recruiting a long-term supervision consultant who will help \n45. \nMPWT  to  supervise  the  2010\u20132013  periodic  maintenance  program  and  the  management \nstrengthening  component  of  the  Project.  This  component  will  provide  training  and  consulting \nservices  to  (i) develop  MPWT\u2019s  ability  to  monitor  the  road  network,  (ii) plan  its  maintenance, \n(iii) develop its capacity to undertake effective road works supervision, and (iv) carry out quality \ncontrol. These consultants will be funded by IDA. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n46.  MPWT may carry out advance contracting for procurement of works and consultants to \nenable selection and preparation of bidding. Advance contracting will not include the signing of \ncontracts or the award of contracts for works. The Government has been advised that approval \nof advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing Project. \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n47. \nThe  Government  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  loan  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  will \nfurther  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPWT  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \n48. \ntransparency,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements.  The  project  design  includes \nmeasures  to  build  capacity  within  MPWT  so  staff  understand  and  comply  with  ADB  and \ngovernment procedures as outlined in the project administration manual. A Project website will \nbe developed to disclose information about project matters, including procurement. With regard \nto  procurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on,  among  others,  the  list  of  participating \nbidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details of bidding procedures adopted, the amount of \nthe  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods  and  services  procured.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism  will  be  set  up  to  encourage  more  stakeholder  vigilance  and  ensure  greater \naccountability.  It  will  receive  and  resolve  complaints  and  act  upon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of \nirregularities  on  matters  relating  to  the  Project,  including  grievances  arising  from  resettlement. \nMPWT  will  publicize  the  existence  of  this  mechanism  widely  to  ensure  that  stakeholders  are \naware that there is a venue to address their concerns or grievances relating to fraud, corruption, \nor abuse in project implementation.  \n\n49. \nThe Government will sign a good governance framework for the Project with IDA. This \nwill include various requirements and measures that the Government needs to comply with and \nimplement (including the establishment of a project website and grievance redress mechanism). \nIn  order  to avoid  duplication,  the  Government,  ADB  and  IDA  agree  that,  with  respect  to those \nrequirements under the good governance framework that are similar to the ADB requirements,  \nthe Government will be required to comply with or implement these only once. For example, the \nGovernment  is  required  to  establish  only  one  project  website  and  one  grievance  redress \nmechanism  to  meet  the  conditions  of  both  the  good  governance  framework  and  ADB.  The \nGovernment will need to consult with both ADB and IDA to ensure that the project website and \nthe grievance redress mechanisms are acceptable to both ADB and IDA. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDisbursements  from  the  ADB  loan  and  the  AusAID  grant  for  contracts  for  consulting \n50. \nservices  and  civil  works  bid  under  ICB  procedures  will  be  through  direct  payment  procedures \ndefined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \n\n \n\n\fDisbursements for incremental expenditures and shopping will be through two imprest accounts. \nMEF will establish one imprest account for the ADB loan and one for the AusAID grant. MEF will \ndelegate  administration  of  the  accounts  to  MPWT  by  means  of  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB. Initial deposits to the two imprest accounts will be based on estimated expenditures to be \npaid from the each imprest account for the first 6 months of project implementation or 10% of \nthe loan (or grant as relevant) amount respectively, whichever is less. Both imprest accounts will \nbe  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Borrower  and \nADB. A statement of expenditure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate \nadvances  to  the  imprest  accounts  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  ceiling  for \nstatements of expenditure will be $50,000 per invoice. Arrangements for disbursement of funds \nmade available from the IDA will follow IDA\u2019s procedures, which are similar to those of ADB. \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n51. \nDGPW will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the proceeds of the ADB and AusAID loan and grant and the IDA credit. \nThese accounts will detail funds received, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of \nlocal funds. Within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year, DGPW  will submit audited annual \nproject  accounts  to  ADB,  AusAID,  and  IDA,  which  will  provide  a  detailed  description  of  the \nsource  of  funds  and  expenditures  made.  The  annual  project  accounts  will  be  reported  in  a \ncommon format for all cofinanciers and will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB, AusAID, and IDA. The auditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB, AusAID, and \nIDA before commencement of work. The annual audit will include an opinion on operation of the \nimprest account and statements of expenditure. Beginning in 2009, a yearly technical audit will \nbe conducted by the technical audit consultant assigned to the Project and will be submitted by \nDGPW to ADB, AusAID, and IDA. \n\nRegular  progress  reports  for  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  DGPW,  assisted  by  the \n52. \nconsultants,  and  will  be  submitted  by  DGPW  to  ADB,  AusAID  and  IDA  every  quarter.  The \nreports  will  be  in  a  common  format  for  all  cofinanciers  and  will  include  a  description  of  the \nphysical progress, status of implementation plans, procurement and contractual status, and any \nimplementation issues. The reports will contain a summary of project accounts, including details \nof  the  latest  project  expenditures  and  contract  amounts.  They  will  include  an  evaluation  of \nprogress  in  implementing  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project, \nDGPW  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  and  submit  it  to  ADB,  AusAID  and  IDA.  The \nreport  will  cover  details  of  project  implementation,  success  in  meeting  performance  targets, \nproject  costs,  performance  of  contractors  and  consultants,  social  and  economic  impact, \neconomic rate of return, and other details as may be requested by ADB, AusAID, and IDA. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53. \nDGPW,  assisted  by  the  consultants,  will  establish  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Preparing  a  Design  and \nMonitoring Framework (2007) and integrate it with the existing management information system. \nWithin 12 months of ADB loan effectiveness, DGPW will conduct surveys to establish baseline \ndata  for  subsequent  performance  monitoring.  A  second  round  of  surveys  will  be  carried  out \nbefore  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  and  a  third  round  will  be  carried  out  6  months  before \nproject completion. The baseline and impact surveys will include appropriate control areas and \nwill assess all interventions under the Project. The main sources of data will include, but not be \nlimited  to,  (i) secondary  data  from  the  Borrower\u2019s  sources,  (ii) traffic  counts,  (iii) freight  and \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\npassenger  surveys,  and  (iv) traffic  accident  statistics.  In  addition,  a  set  of  indicators  reflecting \ntransport  costs,  tariffs,  and  mobility  will  be  developed  to  assess  the  effects  of  the  improved \nroads.  DGPW  will  submit  a  report  to  ADB  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at \ninception, midterm review and project completion. Sample indicators, to be reviewed at the start \nof project implementation, are shown in Appendix 9.  \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nRegular six monthly reviews will be undertaken jointly by the Government, ADB, AusAID, \n54. \nand IDA. In addition, MPWT and staff of ADB, AusAID and IDA will jointly undertake a midterm \nreview  in  about  mid-2010  to  assess  (i) the  status  of  implementation,  (ii) the  performance  of \nconsultants and contractors, (iii) the impacts of the Project, (iv) the progress of implementation, \n(v) the  status  of  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  and \n(vi) the need for any changes in the project scope or schedule to achieve the Project\u2019s impact \nand objectives. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n55. \nThe Project\u2019s benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith  the  assumptions  made  in  the  project  design.  The  combined  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of risks occurring. \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nEconomic. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was calculated by \n56. \ncomparing  the  with-Project  and  without-Project  situations  for  the  project  roads.  In  the  without-\nProject scenario, the roads are assumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue \nto deteriorate. The with-Project scenario assumes sufficient routine and periodic maintenance to \npreserve  the  functionality  of  the  project  roads.  The  feasibility  study  considered  various \nmaintenance alternatives for the project roads, and the proposed Project is based on the most \ncost-effective option. Without the Project, the roads would continue to deteriorate rapidly leading \nto increases in vehicle operating costs. With the Project, these costs will remain as at present or \nescalate more slowly, thus preserving the economic utility of the network. \n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  using \n\n57. \nthe  highway  development  and \nmanagement  system  model  (HDM-4). 15  The  model  evaluates  the  project  investment  by \nconsidering  periodic  and  recurrent  maintenance  costs  as  well  as  the  benefits  derived  from \nsavings  in  road  user  costs.  The  project  life  was  taken  to  be  20  years.  The  economic  analysis \nsubdivided  the  project  roads  into  homogeneous  sections,  defined  by  traffic  volumes  derived \nfrom the traffic analysis, roughness observed during the surveys, and the altitude and gradient \nof the road. The EIRR was estimated for the Project as a whole and was estimated to be 97%, \nindicating  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable.  The  economic  analysis  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 10. \n\n58. \nSeveral sensitivity test cases were examined; (i) periodic maintenance costs increase by \n20%,  (ii) benefits  decrease  by  20%,  (iii) traffic  growth  rates  decrease  by  20%,  (iv) no  periodic \n\n                                                 \n \n15 The HDM-4 software was developed as part of the International Study of Highway Development and Management \nTools, sponsored by the World Bank, ADB, Swedish National Road Administration, the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, and others. \n\n\fmaintenance  is  undertaken  after  implementation  of  the  Project,16 and  (v) a  combination  of  a \n20% increase in periodic maintenance costs and a 20% reduction in benefits. The results show \nthat the quantified economic benefits are robust to the various sensitivity tests and the Project \nremains  economically  viable  in  all  cases.  A  risk  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the \nprobability  of  the  EIRR  falling  below  12%,  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital,  and  the  economic \nviability  of  the  Project.  The  risk  analysis  used  the  @Risk  computer  program  and  a  full \ndescription of the methodology and assumptions used is in Appendix 10. \n\n59. \nThe  high  EIRR  generated  by  the  Project  arises  because  the  cost  of  originally \nrehabilitating  the  roads  is  considered  a  sunk  cost  which,  in  conformity  with  the  principles  of \nwelfare  economic  analysis,  is  not  taken  into  account  when  estimating  the  Project\u2019s  costs  and \nbenefits. However, without these earlier investments there would not have been a road network \nto maintain, so it may be argued that the Project should be seen as an extension of the earlier \nrehabilitation projects and evaluated as such. An analysis including the sunk17 costs of the road \nnetwork has therefore been performed. This analysis yields an EIRR of 23.8%, confirming that \nthe project roads were viable at the time of reconstruction and remain so even when the cost of \nperiodic maintenance is considered. \n\nB. \n\nProject Impacts \n\nSocial. The Project has been formulated to minimize potential social risks. The periodic \n60. \nmaintenance  will  lower  transport  costs  and  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  to  markets  and \nschools, medical facilities and other social services. Farmers will benefit from lower input prices \ncaused by lower freight rates. Poor and nonpoor will benefit from cheaper transport and shorter \ntravel  times.  Better  access  to  public  sector  services  will  make  them  more  cost-effective.  The \nProject will contribute to economic growth and help to expand economic opportunities. However, \nthe extent to which women will be able to take advantage of these opportunities will depend on \neconomic, social, and cultural factors. \n\nThe  summary  poverty  and  social  strategy  is  set  out  in  Appendix  11.  Temporary  labor \n61. \ncamps will not be required since MPWT maintains permanent work camps in all the provinces \nthat will be used by the contractors. The Project is not expected to have any impacts related to \nHIV/AIDS, but roads are a recognized vector for transmission of sexually transmitted infections \nand an HIV/AIDS prevention component has been included in the Project, financed by IDA. The \nsocioeconomic survey indicates that the Project is not expected to have any particular impact on \nethnic  minority  groups.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  is  therefore  not  triggered. \nEveryone  people  in  the  project  road  areas  will  benefit  from  the  economic  development \ngenerated  by  the  Project.  Since  there  are  no  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  groups,  an  ethnic \nminority development plan is not required. \n\n62. \nResettlement. As the Project will maintain only existing road surfaces, there will be no \nimpact  in  terms  of  involuntary  resettlement.  The  roads  being  considered  for  periodic \nmaintenance  work  were  rehabilitated  within  the  past  5  years  and  any  necessary  resettlement \nwas completed at that time. Site visits to sections of the roads where the periodic maintenance \nis to be undertaken showed that the right-of-way was fully cleared and no permanent structures \nwere located within the right-of-way. All the periodic maintenance work will be within the right-of-\n\n                                                 \n \n16 A risk to the Project could be that no further periodic maintenance is undertaken after the Project is implemented. \n\nThe sensitivity test shows that this has little effect on the overall EIRR of the Project (see Appendix 10). \n\n17 Sunk  costs  are  costs  that  were  previously  spent  on  rehabilitating  the  road  network  (para.  4),  estimated  at  about \n$800  million  at  market  prices.  Sunk  costs  are  not  normally  considered  in  economic  analysis  because  previously \nexpended resources have no alternative usage and therefore no alternative value. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fway and hence no new land acquisition is anticipated, as the proposed works do not involve any \nwidening,  heightening  or  realignment  of  the  roads.  Some  temporary  structures  (wooden  poles \nand thatched roofs) serving small shops and stalls have been observed on some of the project \nroads in the right-of-way and resurfacing works could have a minor impact on these temporary \nstructures. However, most of the work will be done within a short period of time so these local \nshops should not suffer a loss of income. There may also be brief impacts on access to the road \ndue to shoulder reconstruction and resurfacing. \n\n63. \nEnvironmental. The proposed works will be limited to the top of the road formation with \nmost of the work being limited to the paved surface itself. DGPW and the supervision consultant \n(para. 45) will ensure that contractors limit their operations to the top of the road formation. The \nmaintenance  works  (e.g.,  resurfacing,  shoulder  reconstruction,  and  pavement  strengthening) \ncould have minor environmental impacts during construction. Sites for extraction of construction \nmaterials  (gravel  and  crushed  stone)  could  have  an  impact  on  soil,  water  and  the  natural \nenvironment.  Material  piled  along  the  roads  could  encroach  on  land  and  create  runoff  into \nagriculture  land  and  drainage  systems.  There  may  be  temporary  smoke  and  dust  emissions, \nand noise and vibration at work sites. However, these impacts will be short term. There could be \nspills of fuel, bitumen, oil, and acid at work sites, workshops and garages. These impacts would \nbe \ntemporary  and  would  be  mitigated  with  appropriate  measures.  An  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) has been prepared to mitigate potential impacts during construction. \n\nC. \n\nProject Risks \n\n64. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  including  delays  in \nimplementation  because  of  the  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  MPWT  in  Cambodia, \nfailure  to  provide  counterpart  financing  on  time,  and  inadequate  enforcement  of  contracts, \nspecifications and procedures. The Project includes a number of measures to mitigate the risk \nof  delays.  A  short-term  individual  consultant  is  to  be  engaged  to  prepare  the  first-year  works \nprogram  and  procure  contracting  services.  The  Government  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s \nemphasis on the timely provision of counterpart funds, and has assured the project processing \nmissions  that  it  can  provide  the  funds  for  all  ADB-financed  road  projects  on  time.  Possible \nfailure to deliver quality project-related decisions, designs and periodic maintenance works is an \nimportant risk, which will be mitigated by requiring a quality management system for the Project, \nensuring  that  all  stages  of  the  works  process  are  fully  documented,  that  the  contractors  use \nequipment that is capable of performing, and is properly calibrated for, the job at hand, and that \ncontractors\u2019 sealing crews and MPWT\u2019s supervision staff are fully trained. This will be overseen \nby  the  supervision  consultant,  who  will  work  with  the  contractors  and  MPWT  staff  to  help  in \ndeveloping better sealing methods and the systems required to monitor performance. \n\n65. \nThere is also a risk that the project roads will not be properly maintained in future and \nthus  the  full  benefits  of  the  Project  will  not  be  realized.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the \nimportance  of  road  maintenance.  The  project  design  addresses  the  risks  of  inadequate \nfinancing for the project roads and the Government has agreed to loan assurances requiring the \nallocation  of  specific  levels  of  financing  for  maintaining  the  project  roads,  in  addition  to \nassurances regarding levels of financing for road maintenance nationwide. \n\n66. \nCompletion of the Project would preserve the project roads, which could perpetuate road \ntraffic accidents, human trafficking, and the spreading of HIV/AIDS. To mitigate this, the Project \nincludes  (i) HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  measures  during  project  implementation \nfinanced  by  IDA,  (ii) financial  support  for  the  national  road  safety  action  plan,  and  (iii) road \nsafety auditing of the project roads as part of preparing works. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MPWT  have  given  the \n\n67. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime. MPWT will make a timely submission of an annual budgetary appropriation \nrequest to MEF and MEF will ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds \nduring each year of Project implementation. \n\nIn  the  event  the  funding  from  AusAID  cannot  be  obtained,  the  portions  thereof \nwill  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  The  Borrower  may  make  alternative \narrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to cover the funding shortfall. \n\nThe Government, through MPWT, will ensure that the project roads are properly \nmaintained and that proper technical supervision and adequate routine funds will \nbe provided. The Government and MPWT will prepare annual road maintenance \nplans prepared throughout the project period and after the Project is completed \nbased on the agreed maintenance standards, traffic volume and assessment of \nneeds. \n\ninformation  about  various  matters  on \n\n(iv)  Within 9 months of ADB loan effectiveness, MPWT will create a project website \nto  disclose \nincluding \nprocurement. With regard to procurement, the website will include information on \nthe  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on \nbidding  procedures  adopted  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods \nand services procured. \n\nthe  Project, \n\n(v)  Within  9  months  of  ADB  loan  effectiveness,  MPWT  will  prepare  a  grievance \nredress mechanism, acceptable to ADB, and establish a task force at the DGPW \nto  receive  and  resolve  complaints/grievances  or  act  upon  reports \nfrom \nstakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds  and  other  irregularities,  including  grievances \ndue to resettlement and environmental issues. The task force will (i) make public \nthe existence of this grievance redress mechanism, through a public awareness \ncampaign,  (ii)  review  and  address  grievances  of  stakeholders  of  the  Project,  in \nrelation  to  either  the  Project,  any  of  the  service  providers,  or  any  person \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  any  aspect  of  the  Project;  and  (iii) proactively  and \nconstructively respond to them. \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government and MPWT will sign and implement the governance framework. \nWith  respect  to  the  several  requirements  under  the  governance  framework  that \nare  similar  with  the  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  contained  in \nparagraphs  47,  48  and  49  of  this  document,  such  as  the  requirements  to \nestablish a project website and grievance redress mechanism, the Government, \nADB and IDA agree that the Government will only be required to comply with one \nor implement once to be considered as having complied with both IDA and ADB's \nrequirements.  For  example,  the  Government  is  only  required  to  establish  one \nproject  website  and  one  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  meet  the  conditions \nunder both the governance framework and ADB requirements. The Government \nwill  consult  with  both  ADB  and  IDA  to  ensure  that  the  project  website  and  the \ngrievance redress mechanism are acceptable to both ADB and IDA. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  and  MPWT  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  engaged \nunder the Project (i) provide for equal pay to men and women for equal work and \nmake  prompt  payment  of  wages;  (ii)  provide  safe  working  conditions  and  water \nand  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female  workers;  (iii)  do  not  violate  any \nprohibitions  against  child  labor  under  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  international \ntreaty obligations; and (iv) require the contractor to include information on the risk \nof  transmission  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  in  health \nand  safety  programs  for  all  construction  workers  employed  under  the  Project. \nSpecific  provisions  to  this  effect  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  and  civil \nworks contracts, and compliance will be monitored by MPWT. \n\nIf \n\nthe \n\n(2002). \n\n(IEE)  and \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental \nthere \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \nthe \naccordance  with \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) prepared under the IEE, and will comply \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nwith \nEnvironment  Policy \nthe \nis  any  discrepancy  between \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB's environment policy, ADB\u2019s policy \nwill  prevail.  The  Government  will  implement  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmanagement  measures,  and  other  recommendations  specified  in  EMP  to \nminimize any adverse environmental impacts arising from the implementation of \nthe Project. MPWT will be responsible for the implementation of the EMP and will \nbe  responsible  for  the  monitoring  during  resurfacing  of  the  pavements, \nassociated  pavement  works  such  as  edge  repair,  line  marking  and  repair  and \nsurfacing of shoulders and during the operation phases. MPWT will monitor the \ncontractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  EMP.  The  Government  will \nensure  that  the  portion  of  the  Project  that  is  to  be  funded  by  other  cofinanciers \nwill adopt the provisions of the IEE and EMP. \n\n(ix)  When  project  roads  pass  through  near-protected  or  sensitive  areas  (nature \nreserves  parks,  conservation  areas,  biodiversity  reserves,  cultural  and historical \nsites,  etc.),  the  Government  will  ensure  cooperation  between  MPWT  and  the \narea  authority  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  protective \nmeasure.  The  measures  may  include  any  combination  of  area  demarcation, \nfencing,  checkpoints,  speed  bumps,  wildlife  passage  zones,  patrols,  or  other \nmeasures \nfrom  encroachment  or \nenvironmental degradation. \n\nto  preserve \n\nintegrity  of \n\nthe  area \n\nthe \n\n(x) \n\nThe  Government  and  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not  involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995).  The  Project  confined  to  resurfacing  of  pavements  and  associated \npavement  works  such  as  edge  repair,  line  marking  and  repair  and  surfacing  of \nshoulders  of  existing  roads.  The  periodic  maintenance  work  to  be  undertaken \nunder  the  Project  does  not  involve  any  widening,  heightening  or  realignment  of \nthe project roads. \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n68. \n\nPrior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe Government will have issued a prakas18 on the establishment of RAMO. The \nprakas  will  clearly  set  out  the  functions,  structure  and  officers  responsible  for \nmanaging RAMO; \n\nthe Government will have appointed a deputy  director general of DGPW as the \nproject director; and \n\nthe IDA Credit Agreement will have been signed between the Borrower and IDA \nand all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than a condition requiring \nthe effectiveness of ADB's Loan Agreement) have been fulfilled. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n69. \nAsian

While  Cambodia  is  serviced  by  road,  rail,  air  and  water  transport,  road  transport \ndominates the domestic transport of goods and passengers. Roads are critical to the social and \neconomic development of Cambodia. \n\n2.  \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  is  responsible  for  road  transport \nand its Directorate General of Public Works is responsible for road maintenance management. \nThe responsibility of MPWT in relation to roads is to: \n\nmanage and develop national policies on public civil works (such as roads) and \ncollaborate with stake holders; \n\nimprove, maintain and manage the roads and other transport infrastructure; \n\ndevelop road and other transport infrastructure regulations; and \n\nassist in development of laws, rules and regulations concerning construction. \n\nThe Directorate General of Public Works is made up of four departments, three of which \n\n3.  \nare related to roads:   \n\nRoad  Infrastructure  Department  (RID)\u2014responsible  for  the  management  and \nadministration of the national and provincial road networks;  \n\nHeavy Equipment Centre (HEC)\u2014an operations unit involved in road and bridge \nreconstruction and major construction works; and \n\nTechnical  Research  Centre \nspecification development. \n\n(TRC)\u2014responsible \n\nfor \n\nroad  standard  and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRID is the key road management organization within MPWT. Eight of its ten operational \n4.  \nunits  are  referred  to  as  \u201coffices\u201d  and  two  are  construction  units.  The  Planning  and  Technical \nOffice  (PTO)  and  the  Inventory  and  Road  Maintenance  Office  (IOMO)  are  directly  involved  in \nroad  planning,  maintenance,  and  operational  management.  There  are  a  24  city  and  provincial \ndepartments of public works and transport (PDPWT) throughout Cambodia who are involved in \nimplementing road maintenance. \n\n5.  \nMPWT is responsible for about 11,400 kilometers (km) of roads, of which 2,070 km are \nprimary  national  highways,  2,710  km  are  secondary  national  highways,  and  6,620  km  are \nprovincial highways. Of  the roads administered by  MPWT,  2,155 km are surfaced with double \nbitumen  surface  treatment  (DBST)  or  asphalt  concrete.  The  balance  (about  9,245  km)  is  of \ngravel or earth construction. \n\nThe  Cambodian  road  network  covers  about  39,400  km,  including  approximately  4,800 \n6.  \nkm  of  national  roads,  6,600  km  of  provincial  roads,  and  28,000  km  of  rural  roads.  The  roads \nhave a significant number of bridges, about 1,020 on the primary highways and 1,210 more on \nprovincial roads. Much of the provincial and rural road network is dilapidated and large parts of \nthe  country  are  effectively  isolated  during  the  wet  season.  Most  bridges  on  the  minor  road \nnetworks are seriously damaged or failed. MPWT has indicated that, while much of the primary \nnational  highway  network  is  in  good  condition,  most  of  the  secondary  highway  network  and \nnearly all provincial and rural roads are in need of urgent repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. \nRoad condition surveys in 2005 confirmed that only about 2,700 km of the 11,400 km managed \nby  MPWT  was  in  good  to  average  condition,  the  remainder  being  in  a  poor  or  very  poor \ncondition.  Of  particular  interest  to  the  proposed  Project  are  highways  that  have  been \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nrehabilitated  in  the  last  3\u20138  years  which  are  not  performing  as  well  as  they  should  do  and \nrequire repairs. These absorb about 35% of the domestic road budget for routine maintenance, \nrepairs,  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  or  $26  million  in  2007.  These  additional  funds  are \nbeing used for the repair of failures or defects that should not be happening. \n\nThe road network managed by MPWT can be characterized as a mixture of average to \n7.  \ngood  paved  roads  (rehabilitated  in  the  last  5\u20136  years)  and  poor  to  very  poor  unpaved  roads, \nmost  of  which  have  not  received  maintenance  and  repair  funds  in  at  least  the  last  5\u20136  years. \nThe paved roads have been constructed to various standards, some with paved shoulders and \nsome without. Those without sealed shoulders are starting to fail in the outer wheel path. The \ndecision  to  not  seal  the  shoulders,  intended  to  save  costs,  is  resulting  in  higher  maintenance \nand reinvestment costs. Poor DBST sealing in recent upgrading and rehabilitation projects has \nresulted in seals with short lives and a poor appearance. \n\n8.  \nRoad traffic on rural roads consists of both motorized and non-motorized traffic, with the \nlatter  making  up  to  30%  of  the  traffic  on  many  roads.  Of  the  motorized  traffic,  75\u201390%  is \nmotorcycles. Medium to large trucks and buses are underrepresented on most rural roads and \nrepresent less than 3% of the motorized traffic. \n\n9.  \nVehicles  that  transport  freight  and  people  include  motorcycles,  mini  buses,  and  light \ntrucks. These vehicles carry from 120 kg (in the case of motorcycles) to 3.5 tons for light trucks \nand  from  an  average  of  1.5  passengers  on  motorcycles  to  more  than  20  passengers  on \nminibuses  and  light  trucks.  In  many  instances  the  vehicles  carry  both  freight  and  passengers. \nCommercial  vehicles  are  both  overloaded  and  poorly  loaded,  with  two-axle  vehicles  carrying \nmuch of their load on their rear axle and much less on the front wheels, making steering difficult. \n\n10.   MPWT  intends  to  improve  its  monitoring  and  control  of  axle  loads.  Eight  automated \n\u201cweigh  in  motion\u201d  sites have  been  established  and  were  fully  operational  by  September  2006. \nMPWT is implementing a project that will install seven permanent weigh bridges by early 2008. \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n11.  \nThe primary tools of the Government's strategy since 1994 have been (i) to focus road \ninvestments on rehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads; \n(ii)  to  undertake  comprehensive  privatization  of  transport  provision;  (iii)  to  selectively  relax \nrestrictive regulations, such as most restrictions on importing motor vehicles and all restrictions \non  access  by  foreign  airlines;  and  (iv)  to  franchise  the  operation,  maintenance,  and \ndevelopment of National Road 4, the two international airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, \nand  air  traffic  control  to  the  private  sector.  The  Government's  strategy  has  restored  a  core \ntransport  system  that  connects  the  country\u2019s  main  centers  and  has  significantly  contributed  to \nintegrating the national economy with the regional and global economies. \n\nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  process  of  decentralization  and  reforms.  For  example, \n12.  \nthe  delivery  of  transport  infrastructure  services,  which  was  previously  centrally  managed  by \nMPWT, is now delegated to the provincial level. The MPWT itself is in the process of shifting its \nfocus away from direct management of transport infrastructure toward planning and oversight of \nthe sector, supported by ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. \nHowever, it is encumbered by shortages of skills and resources in the provinces and centrally to \nundertake these new roles. The reform process is necessary, but given the lack of capacity, is \nfraught with difficulty in the short term. For example, disbursement for road maintenance is now \ndirectly to the provinces, but the provinces are not able to produce credible road maintenance \nplans  or  adequately  justified  budgets.  As  a  result,  road  maintenance  is  generally  poor  even \nthough uncommitted funds are available. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nThe  MPWT  is  currently  preparing  a  revised  strategy  for  future  development  of  the \n13.  \ntransport sector based on the Cambodia transport sector strategy study, financed by ADB and \ncompleted in December 2002. In terms of the transport sector\u2019s development and operation, the \ndraft strategy is likely to emphasize the following objectives and goals.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSupport  sustained  economic  growth  and  promote  external  trade  and \nforeign  direct  investment.  Transport  is  an  integral  part  of  the  production  of \nnearly  all  goods  and  services.  Good  transport  infrastructure  and  cost-effective \ntransport  are  preconditions  for  Cambodia's  export  drive  and  for  realizing  its \ntourism potential.  They are also a major factor in containing the cost of living and \nimproving rural livelihoods. More diversity in transport supply and better transport \nlogistics using multimodal transport chains will improve Cambodia's international \ncompetitiveness and its attractiveness to direct foreign investors. \n\nSupport  poverty  reduction  and  the  integration  of  Cambodia.  By  enabling \ncost-effective  and  reliable  access  to  economic  opportunities  (including  new \nproductive  activities  in  areas  not  previously  open  to  economic  exchange)  and \nsocial services, transport creates the foundations for more inclusive and pro-poor \neconomic  growth.  Accessible  and  dependable  transport  networks,  especially \nprovincial roads, are needed to link the provinces together and to integrate rural \nareas into the mainstream economy. \n\nin \n\ninfrastructure  provision.  The  Government  regards \n\nStreamline  and  focus  sector  institutions  and  expand  private  sector \ninvolvement \nthe \nstrengthening of sector institutions, especially the creation of clear mandates for \ntheir  activities,  as  the  basis  for  institutional  reform.  It  also  recognizes  that  the \nprivate  sector,  including  foreign  investors,  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  the \nfinancing, development, and management of transport infrastructure.  \n\nSecure  the  sustainability  of  transport.  Fuel  taxation  is  a  major  source  of \nrevenue for the Government, and charging for the use of infrastructure has been \nintroduced.  However,  the  scope  for  charging  full  user  costs  is  limited  by  low \ntraffic loads. As direct Government funding for transport infrastructure is equally \nlimited,  meeting  the  funding  requirements  for  infrastructure  development  and \nmaintenance in the short to medium term will require supplementary funding from \nthe private sector and cofinanciers. \n\nImprove  safety  and  enforcement.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  rapidly \ngrowing  social  and  economic  costs  of  poor  traffic  safety  and  recognizes  that \ninefficient  enforcement  because  of  a  weak \ninadequate \nresources, and corrupt practices is a root cause of the problem. \n\nfoundation, \n\nlegal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nTable A3.1: Externally Funded Capital

\n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n28 \n \n\nA. \n\nProject Scope \n\nSUMMARY OF PROPOSED CIVIL WORKS \n\nThe proposed project roads are mainly primary highways (referred to as single digit roads in \n1.  \nCambodia), the exception is NR 11. Sections of all primary highways, except for NR 11 are included \nin  the  works  program  as  they  were  rehabilitated  after  2002  and  will  need  periodic  maintenance \nbetween 2008 and 2013. The proposed works are reseals (asphalt concrete, single bitumen surface \ntreatment  [SBST]  and  slurry  seals)  and  associated  works,  including  shoulder  reinstatement, \npavement failure and crack repairs, line work, and signs. Reconstruction and sealing of shoulders is \nplanned for specific road sections.  \n\nB. \n\nPeriodic Maintenance Works \n\n2.  \nThe Project is intended to renew the seal surface (to correct defects and arrest the aging of \nthe  existing  seals)  and  to  add  new  surface  texture,  thus  ensuring  the  integrity  of  the  seals  and \nproviding  safer  driving  conditions.  Repairs  will  ensure  that  the  new  seals  are  applied  to  sound \npavements  and  other  ancillary  works  are  carried  out,  such  as  shoulder  reinstatement  (shaping \nand/or  adding  gravel),  line  work  and  road  furniture  to  improve  road  safety.  Problems  caused  by \nprevious design and construction will be rectified. Resealing will be carried out a few years earlier \nthan planned in many instances and for some sections extensive repairs and reconstruction of the \nshoulders will be carried out. \n\n3.  \nRoad  sections,  the  type  of  periodic  maintenance  treatment,  and  the  year  maintenance  will \nbe  carried  out  have  been  identified,  but  it  is  possible  that  priorities  will  change  in  the  next  12\u201318 \nmonths.  The  consultants  engaged  to  assist  MPWT  will  review  the  work  program  and  modify  it  as \nrequired. \n\n4.  \nThe treatments to be used included 30 mm asphalt concrete seals, SBST and slurry seals. It \nhas been assumed than an asphalt concrete surfaced road will be resurfaced with asphalt concrete \nand a double or single bitumen surface treatment surfaced road will be resealed with an SBST or \nslurry seal, although the reverse may sometimes be required, depending on road surface conditions \nat the time of final evaluation. \n\nLack of adequate maintenance is a major issue. The Project will provide technical support to \n\n5.  \nMPWT as follows. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMaintenance  Planning.  Planning  will  aim  to  determine  the  most  economically \nefficient regime to keep a road in a maintainable condition throughout its economic \nlife. \n\nMaintenance  Implementation.  Most  maintenance  undertaken  so  far  has  been \nthrough force accounts, using the resources of the provincial departments of public \nworks and transport (PDPWT). This system needs to be replaced by implementation \nthrough competitively bid contracts to improve efficiency and determine market rates \nfor work, instead of negotiated rates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \n\nImplementation Consultants \n   a.

Several weeks before an individual consulting \nassignment  is  scheduled  to  start,  MPWT  will  prepare  a  short  list  of  at  least  three  qualified \ncandidates.  MPWT  will  include  no  more  than  one  candidate  from  any  ADB  member  country. \nMPWT  will  rank  the  candidates,  and  then  submit  their  names  and  qualifications  and  the  draft \ncontract it will use for the engagement to ADB for its approval. ADB will: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nreview MPWT's documents, and \n\napprove MPWT's documents, or  \n\n(iii) \n\nidentify revisions to be carried out before ADB gives its approval. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n\nI. \n\nConsulting Package CS1: First-Year Implementation Consultant  \n\n1. \nThis proposed Project will be implemented over a 5-year period (2008\u20132012). The first-\nyear  program  will  be  a  preparatory  period  of  about  12  months  during  which  the  2008\u20132009 \nperiodic maintenance program will be developed. \n\n2. \nWithin  MPWT,  the  roads  maintenance  program  is  currently  planned,  managed  and \nmonitored by the Inventory and Road Maintenance Office (IRMO) for routine maintenance and \nrepairs,  and  the  Planning  and  Technical  Office  (PTO)  for  periodic  maintenance  rehabilitation \nand  capital  works.  Routine  maintenance  and  repairs  works  are  carried  out  by  the  Provincial \nDepartments  of  Public  Works  (PDPWT)  while  the  army  engineering  units,  various  MPWT \nconstruction  units,  and  some  PDPWTs  carry  out  periodic  maintenance  works.  Although \ngovernment-funded programs will continue to be implemented in the same way, in the short to \nmedium term, the proposed periodic maintenance program will be managed by the Road Asset \nManagement Office (RAMO), assisted by a project management advisor. As this consultant may \nnot be available until early 2009, a short-term consultant needs to be recruited during 2008 to \nprepare design and bid documentation for the first-year program. \n\n3. \nAn  earlier  study  identified  a  list  of  roads  for  the  2008\u20132009  periodic  maintenance \nprogram  and  their  likely  periodic  maintenance  treatments,  along  with  a  candidate  list  for  the \nperiodic  maintenance  program  beyond  2010.  This  candidate  list  will  be  finalized  following  a \ndetailed evaluation by a project management advisor in a separate consulting assignment. \n\nB. \n\nObjective and Outline of Works \n\nThe  overall objective  of this  consulting  work  is  to  assist  MPWT  to  prepare  the  periodic \n4. \nmaintenance program for 2008\u20132009. The tasks will include an evaluation of selected roads, the \nselection  and  design  of  appropriate  treatments,  and  associated  preliminary  works,  and  the \npreparation of bidding documentation based on existing standard documentation.  \n\n5. \nThis first-year program will consist of surface treatments of 30 mm thick asphalt concrete \noverlay,  and  single  bitumen  surface  treatment  (SBST)  and  slurry  seals,  including  associated \npre-treatments,  such  as  reinstatement  of  shoulders  and  the  repair  of  failed  areas.  A  total  of \n$4 million will be allocated (including consulting services) for this first-year program. \n\nC. \n\nWork Activities \n\nThe  consultant  shall  perform  the  tasks  listed  below,  while  additional  details  deemed \n\n6. \nnecessary are given in paras. 7 and 8. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nevaluate the roads identified for the first-year program of 2008\u20132009 (Table A8.1) \nand prepare periodic maintenance treatment designs for these roads; \n\nprepare  bill  of  quantities  and  a  simple  map  showing  the  type  and  approximate \nlocation of proposed works; \n\nprepare the cost estimates for civil works, as required, at the end of the design \nprocess;  \n\nprepare  bid  documents  for  the  identified  road  sections  in  accordance  with  the \nstandard  ADB  bid  documents  for  the  ADB  and  AusAID  contract  and  in \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n37 \n\naccordance  with  bid  documents  prepared  by  the  Provincial  Road  Improvement \nProject  (PRIP)  for  the  World  Bank-financed  contract  (as  indicated  in  para.  8 \nbelow).  The  PRIP  bid  documents  should  also  be  a  reference  document  for  the \nADB- and AusAID-financed contract; and \n\n(v) \n\nprepare  special  specification  clauses  to  be  used  with  the  MPWT  standard \nspecifications. \n\nTable A8.1: Road Sections Identified for the Periodic Maintenance Program \n\nNR \n\nRoad Section \n\nFinancier \n\nExisting \nSurface \nType \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nProposed \nTreatments \n\n1 \n\nKm 69.2 to km 165.4 \n\n5 \n\nKm 3.9 to Kampong \nChhnang (western city \nlimits) \n\nWorld Bank \n\nADB\u2013\nAusAID \n\nDBST \n\n90.5 \n\nDBST \n\n87.2 \n\nSBST, some SS and \nancillary works \n\nSBST and ancillary \nworks \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, DBST = double \nbitumen surface treatment, NR = national road, SBST = single bitumen surface treatment, SS = slurry seal. \nNote: Ancillary works include repairs of failed areas and potholes, crack sealing, seal edge repairs, reinstatement \n\nof shoulders, line work and other pavement markings and road signs. \n\nCost \nEstimate \n($ million) \n\n2.01 \n\n1.87 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n7. \nPavement  Evaluation  and  Treatment  Design.  The  selected  roads  are  generally  in \ngood condition, but need resurfacing to seal and stabilize the road surface which is starting strip \nand crack. It is envisaged that the selection and design of treatments for the first-year program \nwill  be  based  on  visual  evaluations  and  the  review  of  available  traffic  and  historical  data.  The \nevaluation  should  include  the  identification  of  all  surfacing  and  pavement  defects,  failures  and \nrelated  problems.  The  assessment  should  also  be  of  sufficient  detail  to  estimate  the  bill  of \nquantities and to indicate, on a longitudinal map, the type of works, to be carried out. \n\n8. \nPreparation  of  Bid  Documents.  Standard  bid  documents  have  been  prepared  by \nprevious projects for use in small works covered by ICB and NCB contracts, based on the World \nBank\u2019s  small  works  sample  documents.  These  documents  are  generally  complete,  except  for \nthe  details  of  the  road  section.  The  proposed  works  will  require  the  inclusion  of  the  bill  of \nquantities, line  drawings  and  appropriate  extracts  from  the  MPWT  standard  specifications  that \nwill  need  to  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  modified.  The  final bidding  documents  for  World  Bank \ncontracts  only  will  be  prepared  by  a  separate  procurement  agent  who  will  also  assist  MPWT \nwith the bidding process and the award of contract. \n\nD. \n\nTime Schedule, Consultant\u2019s Qualifications, Reporting and Cost Estimate \n\n1. \n\nTime Schedule  \n\n9. \nThe  first-year  implementation  consultant  will  be  an  individual  international  consultant \nwho  will  be  engaged  for  4  months,  in  two  assignments  over  a  period  of  9  months,  starting  in \nJanuary  2008.  The  first-year  implementation  consultant  will  hire  a  local  consultant  to  assist \nhim/her in his task for a period of 4 months, in two assignments to coincide with the first-year \nimplementation consultant\u2019s inputs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n2. \n\nConsultant\u2019s Qualifications Requirement \n\n10. \nThe  consultant  will  be  a  road  maintenance  specialist  and/or  road  engineer  with  a \nminimum of 10 years\u2019 of experience (at least 5 years in developing countries within the region) \nwith  experience  in  pavement  engineering,  identification  of  road  maintenance  needs,  treatment \ndesign,  sealing  equipment  inspection  and  certification,  preparation  of  bidding  documentation, \nand  bid  evaluation.  The  consultant  should  also  have  a  sound  knowledge  of  ADB  and  World \nBank procurement procedures and guidelines.  The local consultant should be a roads engineer \nwho  is  familiar  with  the  workings  of  MPWT,  has  had  some  involvement  in  previous  foreign-\nfunded  projects  and  has  sufficient  English  to  communicate  with  the  first-year  implementation \nconsultant. \n\n3. \n\nReporting Requirements \n\nFifteen  copies  each  of  the  following  reports,  all  in  the  English  language,  shall  be \n\n11. \nsubmitted by the consultants to MPWT: \n\nA road evaluation and design report, for the roads of the first-year program; and \nbidding documents for the associated civil works contracts. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n4. \n\n \n\nCost Estimate \n\n12. \n\nThe cost estimated for this consulting work is $130,000 (Table A8.2).  \n\nTable A8.2: Cost Estimate for First-Year Implementation \nConsulting Services \n\nItem  \n\n  \n1.

The  audit  will  need  to  ensure  (i)  that  the  road  evaluation \nand  design  process  led  to  an  appropriate  selection  of  pavement  treatments  and  their  proper \napplication,  (ii)  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  works  carried  out  were  appropriate,  and  \n(iii)  the  skills  of  MPWT  staff  have  been  improved  and  the  required  systems  established \n(including by technical assistance to contractors to improve their sealing and paving operations). \n\n15. \nThe technical audit will provide an independent professional opinion on the effectiveness \nof the management and implementation of the periodic maintenance program. A key element of \nthe  audit  will  be  verification  that  the  contracted  works  have  been  designed  and  completed  to \nacceptable  minimum  standards,  and  that  the  tendering  processes  have  followed  accepted \npractices. \n\n16. \nDue  to  the  nature  of  these  tasks  and  uncertainties  about  the  timing  and  length  of \nengagement  of  audits,  MPWT  reserves  the  right  to  either  extend  the  contract  to  cover  later \nyears of the Project or to begin a new contract. \n\nC.  \n\nScope of Works \n\n17. \nCivil Works. The technical audit consultant will review the operations of RAMO and the \nimplementation  and  civil  works  procurement  process,  from  the  evaluation  and  design  process \nthrough  to  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of  the  completed  works.  Management  of  these \nprocesses  by  MPWT  units  will  also  be  reviewed  to  establish  their  effectiveness  in  promoting \nquality and completing contracts. Special attention will need to be given to reporting procedures \nand the processing and payment of invoices. \n\n18. \nThe audit report will discuss the processes of conducting the civil works, including their \nstrengths and weakness and any proposals to correct weaknesses. It will comment on whether:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRAMO and its management system can deliver cost-effective road maintenance \nworks of the right quality; \n\npreviously identified design, sealing and paving problems are being remedied; \n\nhuman resources have or will be adequately developed with respect to pavement \nevaluation and design, project management, and construction supervision; \n\nthe evaluation, designs and procurement are based on professional, systematic \nand timely procedures; \n\nthe financial monitoring of the Project is being followed and action is being taken, \nwhen required, by those involved, to ensure that the financial data are complete \nand accurate; \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nthe internal technical and financial auditing procedures in RAMO and DGPW are \nadequate to monitor the Project; \n\nthe  contractors\u2019  payments  are  not  being  unnecessarily  delayed,  and  action  is \ntaken to correct identified problems; \n\nthe maintenance works implemented by MPWT are of an acceptable quality and \nthe work progress and quality monitoring system is operational and being used;  \n\n(ix)  management  of  the  maintenance  program  can  at  any  time  verify  all  steps \nbetween  the  evaluation  and  design  phase  through  to  final  payment  and \ndisbursement by the financing institution; \n\nfor  the  second  and  subsequent  audits,  previous  periodic  maintenance  audit \nreports  are  distributed  correctly  to  MPWT  management,  the  road  maintenance \ninterministerial committee, and MEF; \n\nthe Project, in general, is being implemented cost-effectively in accordance with \nthe agreed implementation schedule;  \n\nthe  internal  technical  auditing  procedures  set  up  in  RAMO  and  DGPW  are \nadequate to monitor the Project; and \n\nconstruction site journals, site meetings minutes and other documents on quality \nand quantity are maintained and archived in an orderly and professional way. \n\n19. \nRoad Asset Management. The technical audit consultant will review the performance of \nthe  project  management  advisor  and  the  independent  supervision  consultant  supervising  the \ncivil works. The key tasks will be: \n\nto  ensure  that  the  systems  and  processes  required  to  ensure  the  periodic \nmaintenance program of the Project are being delivered and are of an acceptable \nquality, starting with pavement evaluation, and treatment selection and design; \n\nto  ensure  that  every  effort  has  been  made  by  the  consultant  to  ensure  that  the \nroad asset management database and planning system have been updated and \nare being used in the development of strategic and annual plans; \n\nto ensure that the systems, manuals, and other materials required to support the \nrole of RAMO have been prepared, are widely available, and are being used; \n\nto ensure that RAMO engineers and other technical staff are directly involved in \ndecision making, inspection, and contract management; and \n\nto ensure that the processes, mechanisms and training materials required for the \nestablishment and implementation of a RAMO skills development program have \nbeen  prepared  and  that  the  program  targets  actual  needs  and  addresses  site \nproblems, including site operations of sealing and paving. \n\nInstitutional and Management Training. The technical audit consultant will review the \n20. \nperformance  of  the  institutional  and  management  training  consultant.  The  key  tasks  will  be  to \nensure that every effort has been made by the consultant: \n\nto ensure that MPWT has accepted its responsibility for road asset management \nand  that  long-term  plans  are  being  developed  and  accepted  by  the  MEF  and \nother related government entities; \n\nto  make  certain  that  developments  within  DGPW  are  consistent  with  those  of  a \nstrong and capable road management organization, including the establishment \nof a basic quality management system and culture; \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nto  make  certain  that  a  skills  development  capability  within  DGPW  has  been \nestablished  and  is  operational  and  that  resources  and  training  materials  have \nbeen prepared;  \n\nto ensure that action has been initiated on changing the roles and responsibilities \nof key DGPW departments; and \n\nto  ensure  that  MPWT  management  is  taking  action  to  improve  its  technical \ncapacity and to embrace its responsibility as the manager of the road network. \n\nD.  \n\nTime Schedule, Consultant\u2019s Qualifications, Reporting, and Cost Estimate \n\n1.  \n\nTime Schedule \n\nThe  technical  audit  consultant  will  be  an  individual  international  consultant  who  will  be \n21. \nrequired for a period of 8 months, in five assignments of 1.5 months each, except for the first \naudit which will be for 2 months. Annual audits will start in May 2009. While it is intended that \none  consultant  be  engaged  for  the  five  audits,  this  may  not  be  possible  and  the  recruitment \nprocess may need to be repeated. The technical audit consultant will hire two local consultants \nto assist him or her. Each local consultant will be hired for a period coinciding with the technical \naudit consultant\u2019s engagement periods for the five audits. \n\n2. \n\nConsultant\u2019s Qualifications  \n\n22. \nThe consultant will be a road management and maintenance specialist with a minimum \nof  15  years\u2019  experience  (at  least  5  years  in  developing  countries  within  the  region)  with \nexperience in road asset management, road organization development, and road maintenance \noperations including international procurement processes. Both local consultants should be road \nengineers, with a sound knowledge of the workings of MPWT, previous involvement in foreign- \nfunded projects and sufficient English to communicate with the technical audit consultant. One \nlocal consultant should have a sound understanding of MPWT organization and its operations \nwhile  the  other  should  have  a  sound  understanding  of  the  technical  aspects  of  MPWT\u2019s  road \nmaintenance planning and operations. \n\n3. \n\nReporting \n\n23. \nThe technical audit consultant will keep MPWT well informed of his or her activities and \nintermediate findings. The highlights of the technical audit, including the audit findings related to \nworks quality, will be presented to RAMO for its review and comment, before being printed and \ndistributed.  Fifteen  copies  of  an  annual  comprehensive  report  on  the  audit,  in  the  English \nlanguage, shall be submitted by the consultant to MPWT. \n\nIn  addition  to  the  opinions  and  findings  contained  in  these  reports,  the  technical  audit \n\n24. \nconsultant will also need to: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlist weaknesses of the system and organization and propose remedial measures, \nidentifying who will be responsible for implementing the changes; \n\ndescribe any other factors which would affect future audits;  \n\ncomment  on  the  capacity  of  MPWT  and  contractors  and  their  preparedness  to \nadopt maintenance methods and technologies; and \n\n(iv) \n\nindicate and bottlenecks that need to be addressed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n4. \n\nCost Estimate \n\n25. \n\nThe cost for this consulting work is estimated at $180,000 (Table A8.3). \n\nTable A8.3: Cost Estimate for the Technical Audit Consulting \nServices \n\nItem  \n\n  \n1.

This  will  prevent  future  transportation  costs  for  passengers  and  freight \nfrom increasing and maintain the accessibility provided by the road network. Existing economic \nactivity  will  be  sustained  and  new  activities  will  begin.  A  benefit  monitoring  framework  with  a \nseries of key performance indicators has been established.  \n\n2.  \nIndicators  will  include  (i) economic  development  in  the  project  area;  (ii) transport  costs \nand  times  for  specific  types  of  vehicles  and  trips;  (iii) transport  services  and  charges; \n(iv) accident  rates;  (v) incomes  per  capita;  (vi) access  to  work,  schools,  markets  and  social \nservices; and (vii) jobs created during construction and maintenance. \n\nData  collection  will  consist  of  (i) secondary  data  from  central  and  local  government \n3.  \nstatistics,  (ii) project  data  and  other  road  and  traffic  information  collected  by  MPWT,  and \n(iii) sample  surveys  of  vehicle  operators,  road  users  and  road  neighbors.  MPWT  will  measure \nperformance  against  the  indicators  at  project  inception,  midterm  review,  completion,  and \nannually  for  5  years  after  completion.  MPWT  will  be  responsible  for  providing  data  on \n(i) average road roughness, (ii) classified traffic counts, (iii) annual expenditures on routine and \nperiodic  maintenance  of  national  roads  and  bridges,  and  (iv) social  and  economic  impact \nindicators.

The \n1.  \neconomic analysis was carried out for various periodic maintenance alternatives for each road \nin the project road network by comparing the with-Project and without-Project scenarios. In the \nwithout-Project scenario, the roads are assumed to receive only minimal maintenance and as a \nresult  they  continue  to  deteriorate.  The  with-Project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  according  to  international  standards.  Various  alternative  maintenance  strategies \nhave been examined to determine the most cost-effective and least-cost option for each of the \nproject  roads.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the  period  2009\u20132032.  The  maintenance \nstrategies will be implemented during the period 2009\u20132013. The analysis covers the economic \nbenefits  from  the  period  2013\u20132032.  All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant  2007  prices.  The \neconomic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. \n\nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition \n\nThe existing road condition of the road network under investigation has been assessed \n2.  \nusing  the  loan  referencing  and  condition  survey  (LRCS)  database  of  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks  and  Transport  (MPWT)  and  updated  by  observations  by  the  road  engineer  during  the \nfield  trips.  The  condition  of  the  roads  includes  both  pavement  condition  surveys  and  road \nroughness surveys. This updated road condition information was applied to the LRCS link data \nand  used  in  the  economic  evaluation  model.  The  average  surface  roughness  levels  in \naccordance  with  the  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  for  each  section  of  the  road  network \nranged from IRI 4.0 m/km to IRI 6.0 m/km. The rate of road deterioration used in the economic \nanalysis  is  based  on  the  levels  of  surface  roughness  that  existed  before  the  Project,  i.e.,  the \nwithout-Project case. These are compared with the roughness values in the with-Project case, \ni.e.,  after  periodic  maintenance  treatments  have  been  applied  and  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings  due  to  the  road  improvement  are  calculated.  The  highway  design  and  maintenance \nstandards model 4 (HDM-4) was then used to analyze the sections. The road roughness level \nafter  improvement  of  the  project  roads  by  various  periodic  maintenance  treatments  (i.e.,  the \nwith-Project case) varies from IRI 2.0 m/km to IRI 3.0 m/km after completion of the works. \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\n3.  \nTraffic volumes on the project roads were determined from traffic surveys undertaken to \ncompile the LRCS database. Traffic counts were undertaken over several days accompanied by \norigin\u2013destination  surveys.  These  survey  results  were  normalized  through  the  application  of \nseasonal factors to obtain annual average daily traffic (AADT) figures for the base year. Traffic \nvolumes on the project road sections ranged from 1,177 vehicles per day to 15,383 vehicles per \nday (Table A10.1). The traffic counts were classified according to vehicle type before they were \nfed into the economic evaluation model. Only motorized traffic was modeled as non-motorized \ntraffic  does  not  significantly  affect  road  deterioration  and  accounts  for  only  10%  of  all  traffic \nusing the roads in the network. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nTable A10.1: Traffic on the Project Road Sections \n\n \n\nRoad Section \n\nNH1 km 60.2\u201369.2 \nNH1 km 159.7\u2013165.4 \nNH1 km 69.2\u2013159.7 \nNH2 km 0\u20138.7 \nNH2 km 8.7\u201370.5 \nNH2 km 70.5\u2013113 \nNH3 km 180\u2013200.5 \nNH5 km 0\u20133.9 \nNH5 km 3.9\u201391.1 \nNH5 km 91.1\u2013168 \nNH5 km 168\u2013286.8 \nNH5 km 288.1\u2013353.1 \nNH6 km 0\u201389.2 \nNH6 km 89.2\u2013161.2 \nNH6 km 161.2\u2013171.6 \nNH6 km 161.2\u2013221.2 \nNH7 km 44.7\u201368 \nNH7 km 68\u2013253 \nNH11 km 0\u201390 \nAADT = Annual Average Daily Traffic. \nSource: Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \n\nAADT \n\n 2,923 \n 2,198 \n 2,198 \n15,383 \n 7,159 \n 4,783 \n 1,177 \n14,509 \n 8,428 \n 5,988 \n 4,040 \n 4,950 \n4,170 \n 4,790 \n 1,886 \n4,790 \n 5,334 \n 2,177 \n 3,272 \n\n3. \n\nTraffic Growth Rate Assumptions \n\nTraffic  growth  rates  were  based  on  a  number  of  variables,  including  transport  demand \n4.  \nelasticity;  past  trends;  Government  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  forecasts  at  national, \nregional,  and  provincial  levels;  population  growth;  and  growth  in  per  capita  income.  Elasticity \nvalues  used  in  previous  studies  in  Cambodia  over  the  last  decade  range  from  1.2  to  1.5  for \nestimating demand passenger transport growth and from 1.0 to 1.4 for freight transport growth. \nMotorcycle demand has regularly been based on an elasticity of 2.0. Traffic growth rates range \nfrom  6%  per  annum  to  10.2%  per  annum,  depending  on  the  vehicle  type  and  the  year.  The \nestimates  take  into  account  past  traffic  growth  and  recent  studies  in  Cambodia.  Because \nforecasts  of  future  traffic  are  determined  by  elasticity  of  demand  and  growth  in  GDP,  an \nallowance  has  been  made  in  the  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  for  variations  of  traffic  growth  to \ntake account of possible variations in the values of the elasticity of demand which determines \noverall  traffic  growth.  Traffic  growth  rates  used  to  forecast  future  traffic  are  shown  in  Table \nA10.2. \n\n5.  \nFuture  traffic  usually  has  three  components:  normal,  generated,  and  diverted  traffic. \nNormal traffic is simply an extension of existing traffic. Generated traffic is traffic that is induced \nto use the road because of lower vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and shorter travel times. To be \nconservative,  no  generated  traffic  or  diverted  traffic  is  assumed  in  this  study.  The  economic \nanalysis examines only savings in operating costs for normal traffic, that traffic that will continue \nto travel even if the roads in the network are not improved. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10.2: Traffic Growth Rates (% per annum) \n\nVehicle Type \n \n\n2006\u20132011 \n\nGrowth Period \n2011\u20132016 \n\n \n\n \nCars \nBuses \nTrucks \nMotorcycles \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n 9.8 \n 9.1 \n 10.2 \n 10.0 \n\n \n\n9.1 \n8.4 \n7.7 \n8.0 \n\n2016 and on \n\n \n\n7.8 \n7.2 \n6.6 \n6.0 \n\n6.  \nThe Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs and include costs of \nperiodic  maintenance,  routine  maintenance,  and  construction  supervision.  Maintenance  costs \nwere  derived  from  rates  of  individual  items  of  works.  The  economic  costs  exclude  price \ncontingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction.  A  standard  conversion  factor \n(SCF)  of  0.90  was  applied  to  the  financial  costs  of  non-traded  inputs  to  calculate  economic \nprices. \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\nD. \n\nBenefits \n\n7.  \nThe major economic benefits of the Project were quantified as VOC savings because of \nimprovements  in  the  road  surface  condition.  VOC  savings  accrue  to  normal  traffic,  i.e.,  traffic \nthat would continue to use the road even if the improvement had not been made. The economic \nevaluation was conservative and assumed no generated traffic. \n\n8.  \nBenefits to road users were estimated from the difference between costs in the without-\nProject  case  and  costs  in  the  with-Project  case.  The  HDM-4  model  was  used  to  estimate  the \nbenefits over time. The model predicts pavement deterioration and estimates yearly VOCs over \nthe  life  of  the  investment  for  various  strategies  of  improvement.  In  both  the  with-Project  and \nwithout-Project  cases  the  road  roughness  level  varies  from  year  to  year  according  to  traffic \nmovement  and  the  maintenance  applied.  The  roughness  level,  expressed  in  terms  of  the  IRI \nhas a direct impact on the VOC and hence on the level of benefits. The model then compares \nlife-cycle  costs  for  the  with-Project  case  with  the  costs  for  the  without-Project  case,  computes \nthe net present value (NPV), and estimates the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n\nTypical  VOCs  for  various  vehicle  types,  based  on  typical  road  roughness  levels  in  the \n9.  \nwithout-Project  case  (i.e.,  minimal  road  maintenance)  compared  with  the  with-Project  case \n(which has reduced the road roughness by the application of periodic maintenance treatments) \nare shown in Table A10.3. The rate of road deterioration used in the economic analysis is based \non  the  levels  of  surface  roughness  that  existed  when  the  project  roads  had  had  only  basic \nroutine maintenance, i. e. the without-Project case, compared with the roughness values in the \nwith-Project case under various maintenance treatments. VOCs due to the improvements were \nthen calculated. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nTable A10.3: Typical Vehicle Operating Costs With-\nProject and Without-Project ($ per km) \n\nVehicle Type \n\nWithout-\nProject \n(IRI = 6) \n\nWith-\nProject \n(IRI = 2.0) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCar  \nLight Truck \nMedium Truck \nHeavy Truck \nMedium Bus \nLarge Bus  \nLight Commercial Vehicle \nMotorcycle \nIRI = international roughness index (meters/km). \nSource: Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \n\n0.42\n0.21\n0.33\n0.64\n0.28\n0.52\n0.23\n0.04\n\n0.15 \n0.12 \n0.21 \n0.37 \n0.17 \n0.30 \n0.14 \n0.03 \n\n \n10.  \nIn  economic  theory  the  value  of  work  time  savings  for  passengers  can  be  high.  In \ngeneral, these people belong to higher income groups and it is assumed that their saved travel \ntime  on  work  trips  allows  them  to  conduct  more  high-priority  work.  That  is  to  say,  their  saved \ntravel  time  is  used  to  increase  the productive  output.  The way  in  which  time  itself  is  valued  is \ndependent upon the wage rate paid. Time saved during nonworking time will not necessarily be \nused to increase productive output and may merely be used to increase leisure time. The value \nof time saved during nonworking time is therefore lower than time saved during working hours. \nTypically, nonworking time is valued at one third working time. \n\n11.  \nTime savings in a developing country like Cambodia are not highly significant, because \nthe actual time savings made (if any) may not be put to other productive uses. By concentrating \non more tangible benefits such as VOC savings, a less misleading picture will be given than if \ntime  savings  benefits  were  introduced.  This  also  makes  the  economic  evaluations  more \nconservative.  If  a  particular  maintenance  alternative  is  economically  feasible  on  VOC  savings \nalone, any additional benefits from time savings will be bonus. \n\nE. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nThe  EIRR  for  the  Project  was  97.0%  with  a  NPV  of  $1,089.1  million,  using  a  12% \n\n12.  \ndiscount rate.

The  EIRR  of  this  Project  is  high  relative  to  typical  road  rehabilitation  projects  because \n(i) maintaining a road is less costly than rehabilitating it periodically; and (ii) maintenance \nprevents  losses  of  road  user  benefits  while  the  road  deteriorates  towards  impassability. \nWhen evaluating the result it should be considered that, although the effectiveness of the \nProject  is  high,  no  change  in  road  accessibility  is  envisaged  compared  with  the  current \nsituation so development impacts are limited to retaining access, as opposed to creating \nnew access, which is achieved in road rehabilitation projects. \n\n3.

Several  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) project  periodic  maintenance  costs \nincrease  by  20%;  (ii)  benefits  decrease  by  20%,  (iii) traffic  growth  rates  decrease  by  20%,  \n(iv)  no  periodic  maintenance  is  undertaken  after  implementation  of  the  Project; 19  and  (v)  a \ncombination  of  an  increase  in  project  periodic  maintenance  costs  of  20%  and  a  decrease  in \nbenefits  of  20%.  The  results  show  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are  robust  to  the \nvarious  sensitivity  tests  and  the  Project  remains  economically  viable  in  all  cases.  Finally,  an \nanalysis including the sunk20 costs of the road network was performed to reconfirm that project \nroads  were  viable  at  the  time  of  reconstruction  and  remain  so  even  when  the  cost  of  periodic \nmaintenance is considered (Table A10.5).  \n\n14.  \nThe  results  show  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are  robust  to  the  various \nsensitivity tests and the Project remains economically viable. The sensitivity test that assumes \nno  periodic  maintenance  takes  place  after  Project  implementation  only  reduces  the  EIRR  by \n1%, from 97.0% to 96.0%. The reason for this is that most project benefits occur within the first \n10 years after completion of the Project. These benefits are so high that, even assuming that no \nfuture  periodic  maintenance  takes  place  every  5\u20136  years,  this  has  little  overall  effect  on  the \nEIRR.  The  sensitivity  test  that  assumes  that  the  sunk  costs  of  the  road  network  are  included \nreduces the EIRR from 97.0% to 23.8%. Including the entire $800 million already invested in the \nroad network is an extreme assumption but it still shows that the EIRR remains robust at 23.8%. \n\nTable A10.5: Results of Sensitivity Tests  \n\nSection \n\n \n\nBase case \nCapital costs increase by 20% \nBenefits reduced by 20% \nDecrease in traffic growth rates by 20% \nNo periodic maintenance after project implementation \nIncluding sunk costs of road network investment \nCapital costs + 20% and benefits \u2013 20% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \nNote: NPV is discounted at 12%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n97.0 \n90.2 \n88.2 \n83.1 \n96.0 \n23.8 \n81.8 \n\nNPV \n($ million) \n1,089.1 \n1,084.4 \n863.8 \n875.1 \n547.9 \n698.3 \n859.1 \n\n \n\n15.   A risk analysis was undertaken for the project road using the @Risk computer software \nprogram  and  taking  into  account  the  uncertainty  present  in  the  estimates  of  the  input \nparameters. The risk analysis was based on triangular probability distributions for the main input \nparameters.  It  runs  a  simulation  in  which  possible  values  of  the  variables  were  randomly \nsampled 5,000 times using a Monte Carlo non-stratified technique. Risk analysis then uses this \ninformation to analyze every possible outcome, executing hundreds of what-if scenarios. \n\n                                                 \n \n19  A risk to the Project could be that no further periodic maintenance is undertaken after the Project is implemented. \n\nThe sensitivity test shows that this would have little effect on the overall EIRR of the Project. \n\n20 Sunk costs are the costs that were previously spent on rehabilitating the road network (para 4. refers), estimated at \nabout $800 million in market prices. Sunk cost is not normally considered in economic analysis because previously \nexpended resources have no alternative usage and therefore no alternative value. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nIn the triangular probability distributions, the first multiplier defines the minimum possible \n16.  \nvalue of the input parameter (there is zero possibility that the actual value will be lower than the \nminimum value). For example, if the multiplier is set to 0.7, the minimum possible value for that \nparameter  is  70%  of  the  estimated  most  likely  value  used  in  the  economic  evaluation.  The \nsecond  multiplier  defines  the  maximum  possible  value  of  the  input  parameter  (there  is  zero \npossibility  that  the  actual  value  will  be  higher  than  the  maximum  value).  For  example,  if  the \nmultiplier is set to 1.2, this means that the maximum possible value for that parameter is 20% \nhigher than the estimated most likely value entered into the economic evaluation. Table A10.6 \ngives the estimated triangular probability distribution minimum and maximum possible values for \nthe  variables  tested  in  the  risk  analysis.  It  can  be  seen  in  the  table  that  some  minimum  or \nmaximum  possible  values  are  the  same  as  the  model  input  value,  e.g.,  the  maximum  traffic \ngrowth  rate  is  the  same  as  the  model  input  value  for  the  traffic  growth  rate.  Similarly,  the \nminimum value of the project investment cost is not expected to be lower than the model input \nvalue. This has been undertaken to enable the risk analysis program (@Risk) to use the most \npessimistic scenarios in estimating the probability of the EIRR for each option falling below 12%. \n\nTable A10.6: Variable Probabilities for Risk Analysis of the Project \n\nVariable \nNumber \n \n\nVariable Description \n \n\nTriangular Distributions \nMultiplying Factors \nModel \nInput \nValue \n\nMaximum \nPossible \nValue \n\nMinimum \nPossible \nValue \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n\nBase Normal Traffic \nTraffic Growth Rate \nProject Maintenance Costs \n\n0.50 \n0.5021 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n1.00 \n1.50 \n\n \nThe  risk  analysis  with  the  input  variable  distributions  has  the  immediate  effect  of \n17.  \nreplacing  the  original  (most  likely)  values  with  the  mean  values  for  the  new  distributions  and \nthus recalculates the base case EIRR. The new base case EIRR becomes 80.9%. The results \nfrom the risk analysis indicate that there is a zero probability of the EIRR for the Project falling \nbelow 12%. The @Risk model calculated the new mean EIRR as 80.9%. The minimum value of \nthe EIRR was calculated as 57.7% and the maximum as 94.8% (Table A10.7).

Many of \nthem  face  food  shortages  for  several  months  and  are  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  because  of  their \nreliance on subsistence agriculture. Better roads will help communities deprived of access to information, \nmarkets, off-farm employment, and social services. \n \nThe country\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed during decades of civil war and conflict, and its socioeconomic \nindicators  are  poor.  According  to  census  data  for  2004,  the  population  was  12.8  million,  35%  of  whom \nlived below the poverty line. The incidence of poverty has declined only modestly in recent years and the \npoor  are  excluded  from  the  mainstream  economy.  Improvements  to  Cambodia\u2019s  basic  infrastructure  are \ncritical for its economic development. \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to  protect  existing  road  assets  that  have  recently \nbeen rehabilitated. Poor construction standards; high traffic growth, especially of heavy traffic; and cases \nof bad design and construction quality mean that urgent action is required to establish comprehensive and \nprioritized  road  maintenance  planning  and  to  begin  periodic  maintenance.  This  would  enable  MPWT  to \napply future road maintenance allocations effectively and, in the short to medium term, preserve the road \nnetwork so it can contribute to future economic growth by lowering transport costs and improving access \nfor the movement of goods and people. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.   Poverty Analysis  \nFollowing ADB\u2019s enhanced poverty reduction strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general \ninterventions no longer require poverty assessments.  \n \nPoverty Profile \n \nCambodia was ranked 129th out of 177 countries in the 2006 Human Development Report. Approximately \n36%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population  falls  below  the  poverty  line.  The  rural  population  has  substantially  lower \nsocial indicators than the urban population and poverty is widely distributed through out the country. Since \nCambodia\u2019s  reentry  into  the  international  community  in  1991,  it  has  made  significant  advances  in  both \nhuman and economic terms. Since 1993, GDP has grown 40% and the country has developed a vibrant \nand growing export industry. This has reduced poverty and led to human development. \n \nHIV/AIDS \n \nCambodia  has  the  highest  reported  adult  prevalence  of  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific. There is an increased risk of infection of HIV/AIDS during the maintenance work period although \nthis will depend on the scale of the works. Road workers may contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS and \nother  sexually  transmitted  infections  in  the  communities  around  the  construction  sites  and  in  their \ncommunities  of  origin.  The  Project  will  include  an  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  program  and  a \nparticipatory  approach  to  raising  HIV/AIDS  awareness  will  be  followed.  This  will  be  based  on  best \npractices  developed  under  previous  TA,  Preventing  HIV/AIDS  Among  Mobile  Population  in  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion. \n \nExpected Impacts on Poverty and Vulnerability \n \nThe preservation of the national road network will help to further economic growth by (i) reducing transport \ncosts  and  inducing  more  efficient  movement  of  passengers  and  goods;  (ii)  providing  better  road \nconnectivity; and (iii) strengthening general economic development in all parts of Cambodia. \n \nBecause the project roads have been rehabilitated and paved in the last 10 years, the short-term impact of \nroad maintenance works will be limited. However, in the medium and long term, preserving the road \nnetwork will ensure future economic growth by lowering transport costs and improving access for the \nmovement of goods and people.  \n \nPart of the maintenance will be to the pavement of non-paved shoulders. This will help the circulation of \nslow traffic (including bicycles, carts and pedestrians) mainly used by poor people. \n \n \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\nC.   Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nEnvironmental impact assessments or initial environment examinations, and resettlement plans were \nprepared for each road project during the last 10 years. During the preparation of these documents, \nstakeholder analyses were conducted in each affected community. However for this project no further \nstakeholder analysis was conducted. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe HIV/AIDS prevention program includes community participation during implementation.  \n\n Yes  \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nD.   Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn  Cambodia,  women  are  key  players  in  the  domestic  and  economic  aspects  of  the  households  and  are \nactive in community affairs. Women make up half of the population living along the road and, on average, \nadult women head 25% of the households. In several communities, the proportion of households headed by \nwomen is as high as 40%, which is largely a consequence of the civil war. Over 40% of women who head \nhouseholds are engaged in some kind of business (e.g., a small shop or petty trading) and this constitutes \ntheir main source of income. However, women earn less than men. \n \nGender relations and values, and in particular traditional tolerance of prostitution has posed a challenge to \nthe battle against HIV/AIDS. In general, the public health system does not serve women well. \n \nAn HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness campaign will be conducted only if a large construction camp \nis  needed.  It  will  be  conducted  by  the  maintenance  contractors  and  MPWT  with  active  involvement  of \ncommunities,  relevant  government  agencies  and  NGOs,  the  women\u2019s  union,  the  youth  union,  health \nworkers, and female community leaders and members.  \n \nItem \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\n \nCivil works will cover only the asphalt overlay within \nthe  carriageway.

However,  the  environmental  implications  of  the  Project  have  been \nreviewed and mitigation measures will be directly integrated into the project design. In addition, \nan environmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared. \n\n4. \nThe paved national road network has been rehabilitated over the last 10 years. Most of \nthe  projects  were  funded  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  (JBIC).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  or  environmental  impact \nevaluation  (EIE)  has  been  prepared  for  each  national  road  rehabilitation  project  under  this \nProject.  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Proposed Project \n\n5. \nThe proposed Project aims to protect existing road assets. The national roads under this \nProject have recently been rehabilitated. The types of maintenance work anticipated under the \nProject are resurfacing of pavements and associated pavement works such as edge repair, line \nmarking, and repair and surfacing of shoulders. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nThe paved national road network in Cambodia encompasses about 2,000 km of primary \n6. \nand secondary highways, located all over the country. These national roads link Phnom Penh to \nthe  Thailand  border  in  the  northwest  (national  roads  [NRs]  5  and  6),  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic border in the north (NR 7), to the Viet Nam border in the south (NRs 1 and \n2) and to Sihanoukville in the southeast (NRs 3 and 4). \n\n7. \nCambodia's  climate  is  dominated  by  the  monsoon  which  causes  distinct  wet  and  dry \nseasons. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from May to October. The northeast \nmonsoon brings drier and cooler air from early November to March, then hotter air in April and \nearly May. The southern part of the country has a 2-month dry season and the northern areas a \n4-month dry season. \n\n8. \nTopographically Cambodia is divided into three distinct parts: the central plains, the flat \ncoastal areas, and the mountain ranges with high plateaus. The central plains form 75% of the \ncountry and consist of the alluvial plains of the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap Basin. These \nare  Cambodia's  two  dominant  topographical  features.  Most  national  roads  are  located  in  the \ncentral plains. \n\nForests make up a major part of the country's natural resources. Hill evergreen, tropical \n9. \nrain, and dry land evergreen forests are found in the humid coastal ranges, humid northeastern \nuplands, and the very humid to subhumid low altitude areas. Freshwater inundated forests are \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nfound  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  and  in  areas  of  the  Mekong  River.  Mangrove  forests  are  found \nalong the coasts of Kampot and Koh Kong provinces. \n\n10. \nCambodia has a rich biodiversity. The forests, wetlands and other habitats support many \nspecies of flora and fauna, including 130 species of mammals, more than 600 species of birds, \nmore than 2,300 plants, and an unknown number of reptiles and amphibians. \n\n11. \nTwenty-three  protected areas  have been  designated,  covering  3,402,200  hectares  (ha) \nor  19%  of  the  country's  total  area.  The  protected  areas  cover  representative  ecosystems \nincluding  evergreen,  deciduous,  and  edaphic  forests,  and  examples  of  fragile  and  critical \nhabitats. These areas are well distributed throughout the country. \n\n12. \nThe Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. In 1997 it was nominated \nas a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and the Biosphere Reserve Program of United Nations \nEducation  and  Scientific  Cooperation  Organization  (UNESCO).  NRs  5  and  6  surround  this \nreserve. \n\n13. \nPoverty  is  widespread  in  Cambodia.  Some  provinces  are  inhabited  by  refugees  and \nthere are large areas of unexploded ordnance and land mines. Rice cultivation is the dominant \nagricultural  activity,  but  yields  are  frequently  erratic  due  to  flooding.  Safe  drinking  water  is  a \nmajor concern as the quality of groundwater and surface water supplies are poor during the dry \nseason. Malaria is endemic. \n\nD. \n\nReview of Environmental Implications \n\n14. \nRoad  maintenance  operations  may  potentially  affect  the  environment  in  a  number  of \nways, including construction camp maintenance, storage and handling of wastes and hazardous \nmaterials,  materials  stockpiling,  and  the  location  of  borrow  pits  and  quarry  sites.  Poorly \nexecuted maintenance may create soil erosion and affect streams or other water bodies. If there \nare  no  clear  plans  for  environmental  management  solid  waste  materials  may  be  disposed  of \ninappropriately  and  uncontrolled  noise  and  dust  can  create  a  nuisance  for  individuals  and \ncommunities.  These  concerns  are  heightened  where  roads  pass  through  protected  areas  or \nother  sites  of  a  sensitive  ecological  nature,  such  as  wetlands,  streams  or  forest  areas  and \nprotected areas. \n\n15. \nAn  EMP  has  been  prepared  for  this  Project.  Table  A12  presents  the  main  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  due  to  road  maintenance  works  under  this  Project  and  the  proposed \nmitigation measures. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fActivity \nResurfacing of \npavements and \nassociated pavement \nworks and repair and \nsurfacing of shoulders \n\nTransport of materials \n\nTable A12: Potential Impacts and Proposed Mitigation Measures linked to Maintenance Works \n\nPotential impacts \n\nMitigation measures \n\n-  Possible pollution of waterways or \n\n-  Strict control to avoid spills; contractors to have adequate clean up procedures \n\ngroundwater by bituminous products or \nsolvents \n\n-  Works can have temporary effects on \nirrigation or washing or drinking water \nsupplies \n\n-  Dust, noise and vibrations \n\n-  Effect on traffic and pedestrian safety \n \n-  Air and noise pollution for any nearby \nsettlements and damage to existing \nroads \n\n \n\n-  Contractors to take into account local water uses \n \n\n-  Specifications for watering to be included in the contract \n-  Noise and vibrations from contractors\u2019 equipment to be controlled, especially close \n\nto settlements \n\n-  Construction activities to be avoided at night when close to residential areas \n-  Contractors to employ safe traffic control measures and to limit possible disruption \n\nto nonconstruction traffic \n\n-  Contractors\u2019 vehicle speeds to be controlled, noise and weight of loads to be  \ncontrolled, dust and flying debris to be reduced by covering loads or wetting \nmaterial if necessary \n\n-  Locally available construction material to be used wherever possible to minimize \n\ntransport distances \n\nMaterials stockpiling on \nshoulders \n\nsolids \n\n-  Possible pollution of waterways by \n\n-  Appropriate location for materials stockpiling to be selected, well away from any \n\nwaterways, irrigation or washing or drinking water supplies \n\nBorrow areas \n\n \n-  Possible impacts on road users safety \n-  Quarries and borrow pits can have \n\n-  Encroachment on carriageways to be avoided \n-  Trees to be preserved during material stockpiling \n-  Borrow areas to be located away from residential or other environmentally \n\nimpacts on soils, water and the natural \nenvironment \n\nsensitive areas, such as hospitals, intensive livestock production areas or wildlife \nbreeding areas \n\n5\n8\n\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\nWorksite installation (if \nneeded) \n\n-  Degradation of plant cover \n \n-  Soil and water pollution (trash \n\ndumping, oil spills) \n\n-  Farmlands and forests to be avoided as much as possible, work to be restricted to \n\ndaylight hours, size and frequency of blasting to be limited \n\n-  Borrow areas to be restored and re-vegetated \n-  Work site installations to be situated in order to reduce impacts on the environment \n\nand on the people living in the immediate vicinity \n\n-  Fuel and oil, and bitumen storage areas to be located well away from any \n\nwatercourses \n\n-  These storage areas will be provided with interceptor traps so that accidental spills \n\ndo not contaminate the environment \n\n-  All waste oil will be stored and disposed of to acceptable oil industry standards \n-  Wherever possible, refueling will be carried out at a fuel storage area and not \n\npermitted within or adjacent to watercourses \n\n-  On completion of the work, contractors shall restore the sites to their original state  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nE. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n16. \nBecause  the  Project  will  be  limited  to  resurfacing  of  existing  pavements  and \nreconstruction  of  shoulders,  there  are  few  environmental  risks  associated  with  it.  Any \nenvironmental issues associated with the Project will be temporary and localized. However, for \nlarge resurfacing works, construction camps will increase the environmental risks. \n\n17. \nThe environmental review of the Project indicates that overall environmental impacts are \nacceptable. Mitigation measures have been identified that are necessary and sufficient to satisfy \nall  environmental  requirements  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  and  Cambodian \nregulations. The types of effects of the anticipated maintenance works are well understood and \ndocumented.  Mitigation  measures  are  known  and  if  applied  in  practice  can  eliminate  the \nenvironmental risks. \n\nF. \n\nConclusion \n\nPotential \n\nidentified  and  mitigation  measures  drawn  up. \n18. \nImplementation  of  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  and  the  EMP  will  reduce  environmental \nimpacts.  \n\nimpacts  have  been \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB \nAusAID \nDGPW \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nIA \nICB \nICCRRM \n", "IDA \nJICA \nkm \nMEF \nMPWT \nNCB \nNR \nPDPWT \nPPTA \nRAMO \nSOE \nTA \n", "Currency Unit (Cambodia)\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 December 2007) \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n \n", "riel (KR) \n$0.00025 \nKR3,980 \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nDirectorate General of Public Works \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \nInterministerial Committee for Coordinating Road Repair and \nMaintenance \nInternational Development Agency \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nkilometer \nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport \nnational competitive bidding \nnational road \nProvincial Department of Public Works and Transport \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nRoad Asset Management Office \nstatement of expenditure \ntechnical assistance \n", " \nNOTE \n \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "C.
