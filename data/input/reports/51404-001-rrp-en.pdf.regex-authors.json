This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions framework.1 The transaction involves a loan facility of up to $20,000,000 (or its yuan \nequivalent) to MicroCred Nanchong Company Limited and MicroCred Sichuan Company Limited \nfor Financing Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Western Region in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan to support the companies\u2019 lending operations to \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the underdeveloped western region of \nthe PRC. By improving access to finance, the project will support the expansion of small \nbusinesses and generation of additional employment opportunities, which will in turn contribute \nto poverty reduction. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Despite rapid economic growth since 1980s, the PRC continues to face regional disparity \nand income inequality. Provinces with the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are in \nthe central and western regions. In 2016, GDP per capita in the western province of Sichuan was \nonly 33% of that in Beijing. MSMEs represent a vital part of the PRC economy and, given their \nimportant role in employment generation, their development directly contributes to inclusive \neconomic growth.2 Small businesses with up to 300 employees account for 98.6% of firms in the \nPRC,3 contribute more than 60.0% to national GDP and about 50.0% to the country\u2019s tax income, \nand generate more than 80.0% of urban employment.4 More jobs associated with the faster \ngrowth of MSMEs in the central and western regions could help reduce regional disparity. MSMEs \nare  a  major  contributor  to  economic  growth  in  underdeveloped  regions,  but  they  remain \nconstrained by limited access to finance. By the end of 2017, credit to micro and small enterprises \nrepresented only 24.7% of total bank loans.5 Compared with similar enterprises in the east, small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the central and western regions have more restricted \naccess to finance and face average borrowing costs that are more than 70 basis points higher.6 \n \n4.  Microcredit companies. Microcredit companies play an important complementary role in \nfinancing MSMEs. In 2005, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) approved the establishment of \nmicrocredit companies to promote inclusive finance development. The microcredit market has \ngrown rapidly, but it remains fragmented. By the end of 2017, the PRC had 8,551 microcredit \ncompanies with total registered capital of CNY827.03 billion and total outstanding loans of \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Beijing. ", "2 \n \nCNY979.95 billion.7 Microcredit companies in the PRC are defined as credit-only companies that \ncannot  take  deposits  and  are  regulated  by  local  Finance  Affairs  Offices  (FAOs).8 Current \nregulation stipulates that major funding sources of a microcredit company are capital contributed \nby its shareholders plus donated capital and additional finance from no more than two banks. \nFurthermore, bank funding to microcredit companies is generally capped at 50% of the microcredit \ncompany\u2019s net capital, which constrains expansion. Some FAOs later issued local policies to \npermit  higher  leverage  limits  for  microcredit  companies  under  their  regulation.  Microcredit \ncompanies are also allowed to operate only within their province of registration. As a result, while \nthe number of microcredit companies has increased rapidly since 2005, individual growth is a \nchallenge. In addition, banks are reluctant to lend to many microcredit companies because \ngovernance, internal controls, and performance standards vary across companies. The banking \nregulator has a cautious attitude toward lending to microcredit companies as well, leading to \nmicrocredit companies\u2019 heavy dependence on shareholder funding. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations target underserved customer segments and regions \nprimarily through nonbank financial institutions. In its second private sector loan project supporting \nmicrofinance in the PRC, ADB provided $50 million in debt to CFPA Microfinance Management.9 \nADB identified MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan as strong partners in providing credit \nto MSMEs in the underdeveloped western region of the PRC. Both companies are fully owned \nsubsidiaries of MicroCred China Limited (MCL) and are registered in Sichuan, one of the PRC\u2019s \npoorest  provinces  whose  GDP  per  capita  ranks  24th  among  all  31  provinces.  MicroCred \nNanchong was the first foreign microcredit company to enter the country and started its operations \nin Jialing, a district in the city of Nanchong in Sichuan that the central government has designated \nas a poverty-stricken district. MicroCred Sichuan was subsequently established in 2011. The two \ncompanies have built a long and successful record in providing unsecured microloans to MSMEs \nin Sichuan province. At an aggregate level, MCL has strong shareholders, sound corporate \ngovernance, an experienced management team, developed risk management systems, and \nsatisfactory financial performance. MCL has experienced rapid growth since its establishment \nand has plans for further expansion. Longer-term ADB finance will provide critically needed \nfunding to support its growth, which in turn will improve access to finance for MSMEs in the PRC, \nincluding female micro entrepreneurs in underdeveloped regions. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  Baobab,  a  microfinance  holding  company  based  in  France  and  formerly  known  as \nMicroCred SA, established MCL in February 2007 in Hong Kong, China as a specialized MSME \nfinance investment holding company focused on supporting the PRC. Operating through the two \nsubsidiaries, MCL provides financial products and services to micro and small entrepreneurs \nexcluded from the traditional financial system. MCL is the market leader among microcredit \ncompanies  in  Sichuan.  Through  MicroCred  Nanchong  and  MicroCred  Sichuan,  MCL  has \ndisbursed 162,384 loans totaling more than CNY8.89 billion as of March 2018. The company has \na strong presence in Sichuan, with a network of 28 branches and outlets under MicroCred \nNanchong and 15 under MicroCred Sichuan,10 covering most cities and counties in the province. \n                                                \n7  PBOC.  2018.  2017  Statistics  Report  on  Microcredit  Companies.

Ownership. Baobab has a majority stake in MCL. It also has a majority stake in MicroCred \nAfrica, which operates in eight African countries. Baobab was established in 2005 to provide \nsimple  and  affordable  financial  products  to  individuals  and  micro  and  small  businesses \nunderserved by traditional banks. Its main shareholders include the AXA Group, the European \nInvestment Bank, Apis Partners, Maj Invest, and the Nordic Microfinance Initiative.11 The second-\nlargest  MCL  shareholder  is  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC).  IFC  has  been  a \nshareholder since 2007. KfW and Developing World Markets, a private equity fund manager \ndedicated to socially positive investment, are the remaining shareholders.

Enhanced tax \nintegrity due diligence was also conducted.13 The results of such analyses are set out in the \ndisclosure document.14 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n8.  ADB will provide a senior secured term loan facility to MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred \nSichuan of up to $20 million (or its yuan equivalent) with a tenor of up to 5 years. MicroCred \nNanchong and MicroCred Sichuan will be coborrowers and be jointly and severally responsible \nfor payment obligations under the loan facility. The loan facility will fund MicroCred Nanchong and \nMicroCred Sichuan lending operations to MSMEs in the underdeveloped western region of the \nPRC. The subloans are expected to primarily support the operation and expansion of small \nbusinesses in services, trade, and manufacturing, and help generate jobs in local communities. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  Legal documentation. The loan facility will be governed by a loan facility agreement, \nwhich will contain terms customary for a loan facility of this nature and amount. \n \n10.  Reporting  arrangements.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project.  MicroCred  Nanchong  and \nMicroCred Sichuan will provide ADB with financial and other reports at predetermined regular \nintervals  and  as  requested.  These  reports  will  include  (i)  semiannual  unaudited  financial \n                                                \n11 Ownership, Management, and Governance; and Integrity and Tax Due Diligence (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n12 ADB. 2003.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n12.  Provide long-term finance. As local FAOs supervise microcredit companies, MicroCred \nNanchong and MicroCred Sichuan do not have access to deposits and face difficulties in obtaining \nfinance from commercial banks. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n13.  Support finance sector development. Microcredit in the PRC is still in the early stage of \ndevelopment and there is vast unmet demand for microcredit from the underdeveloped central \nand western regions of the country. The loan facility will support the development of a leading \nmicrocredit company in a poor western province of the PRC, thus contributing to the development \nof this underdeveloped province. \n \n14.  Support effective gender mainstreaming. The project has gender-specific loan targets \nand is expected to benefit more than 10,000 female borrowers. The project team has prepared a \ngender action plan to support the effective gender mainstreaming classification of the project.15 \nThis includes measures to improve women\u2019s financial planning and awareness of consumer \nprotection issues, increase MCL\u2019s outreach to potential female borrowers, and enhance service \nquality to women through staff training. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n15.  Impact. The project will contribute to improved access to finance by MSMEs in the \nunderdeveloped western region of the PRC as outlined in government plans to promote inclusive \nfinance.16 ADB\u2019s funding will enable MCL, through MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan, \nto scale up its business, reach underserved customer segments, and provide urgently needed \nfunding  to  MSMEs  to  support  employment  generation  and  poverty  alleviation  in  the \nunderdeveloped regions. This will help boost income opportunities, reduce poverty in the target \nregions, and contribute to economic development. \n \n16.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the enhanced sustainability of MCL\u2019s MSME \nfinance operations in the underdeveloped western region of the PRC. This will help boost income \nopportunities and reduce poverty in the target regions. \n \n17.  Output. The output will be MCL\u2019s increased lending capacity to MSMEs. Lending to \nfemale borrowers will be increased and service quality to women will be improved as a result of \nstaff training focusing on the special needs of female borrowers. \n                                                \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Government of the PRC. 2015.

Consistency with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two \npriorities of the Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, and (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality.17 The Strategy 2030 highlights ADB\u2019s supports for SMEs \nand inclusive businesses to help generate quality jobs and support inclusive growth for all. It is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC18 and ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC, which prioritize promoting inclusive economic \ngrowth,  reducing  poverty  and  inequality,  developing  SMEs,  and  promoting  private  sector \ndevelopment by improving access to finance.19 The project also aligns with ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.20 \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith the Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan, which noted that ADB will promote \nenhanced  financial  access  for  the  traditionally  underserved,  particularly  SMEs. 21  ADB\u2019s \nMicrofinance Development Strategy called for tapping the increasing potential of the poor by \nexpanding access to microfinance.22 ADB\u2019s enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy also stated \nthat ADB seeks to promote sound and efficient financial markets to improve access to finance \nand  achieve  pro-poor  growth.23 As  noted,  the  project  builds  on  previous  ADB  support  for \nmicrocredit in the PRC. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n20.  Category FI (treated as C). ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).24 The business activities of MicroCred Nanchong and \nMicroCred Sichuan have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and are unlikely to entail \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The loan facility will fund the MSME \nfinance operations of MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan in the underdeveloped \nwestern region of the PRC, but it will specifically exclude subloans that are classified category A \nor B for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. MicroCred Nanchong \nand MicroCred Sichuan aim to improve the living conditions of clients and their families and to \ncontribute to the development of the local economy. MCL and its operating subsidiaries are also \ncommitted to implementing a fair human resources policy while respecting the environment they \noperate in. At the end of 2017, the average size of MCL\u2019s loans was CNY49,153 and 73% were \nbusiness  loans  in  trade  and  services.  The  size  and  nature  of  these  loans  present  low \nenvironmental  and  no  social  safeguard  risks.  No  land  acquisition,  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement, or impact on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities is foreseen in relation to any \nactivities of the sub-borrowers. \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2018.

The manual \nrequires all loans to be screened against the IFC exclusion list and environmental and social \ncriteria and to comply with national and international regulatory requirements. The manual does \nnot prohibit funding projects classified category A or B under company criteria, but caps funding \nat 5% of the portfolio for category A projects and 40% for category B projects. The classification \nsystem appears conservative, with explicit criteria and default categories for different industries \nbased on potential environmental and social risks. Through MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred \nSichuan, MCL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list; (ii) exclude activities with \ncategory A and B environment and social safeguard impacts from the proposed ADB loan facility; \n(iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001); and (iv) take measures to comply with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan will confirm this \nin their periodic report to ADB and need not apply any other specific safeguard or social \nrequirements.25 \n \n22.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), MicroCred Nanchong and MicroCred Sichuan have incorporated measures to promote \ngender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in their business activities. The MCL Group \nestimates that the number of its female borrowers will reach 10,033 and its outstanding loan \nportfolio to female borrowers will reach CNY528 million by 2024. Measures to further empower \nand benefit female borrowers and staff have been identified and will be incorporated in the project \ndesign.  MicroCred  Nanchong  and  MicroCred  Sichuan  will  submit  periodic  reports  on \nimplementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n23.  MicroCred Sichuan, MicroCred Nanchong, and MCL were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of \nimplementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and \nthe  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes \nappropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; \nand remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.
