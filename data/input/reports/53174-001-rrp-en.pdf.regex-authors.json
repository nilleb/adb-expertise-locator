I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsecured loan of up to B235,550,648 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) to Lomligor \nCompany Limited for the Southern Thailand Wind Power and Battery Energy Storage Project in \nThailand. The report also describes the proposed administration of a secured loan of up to \n$4,750,000 to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF)1 for the Southern Thailand Wind \nPower and Battery Energy Storage Project. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CTF loan. \n \n2.  The proposed loans will support Lomligor in providing long term financing for a 10-\nmegawatt (MW) wind power project with an integrated 1.88-megawatt-hour (MWh) pilot battery \nenergy storage system (BESS). The project will be the first private sector project in Thailand to \nintegrate utility-scale wind power generation with battery energy storage, and will have an \nimportant demonstration effect. As the deployment of intermittent generation from wind and solar \nincreases, battery energy storage becomes vital in providing higher levels of renewable energy \nto the grid and helping ensure the stability and reliability of the overall power system. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Thailand\u2019s natural gas resources have long been a reliable source \nof low-cost energy, but growing demand, dwindling domestic reserves, and the commitment to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions mean the country must find new fuels and technologies to help \nmeet its future power needs. Power consumption has risen by an annual average of 3.5% from \n2009 to 2018, and demand is expected to double from 2015 to 2036. To meet this demand, \nThailand adopted the Power Development Plan, 2018\u20132037, which targets to install 29,358 MW \nof renewable energy capacity by 2037, representing about 33% of total installed electricity \ngeneration capacity.2 As of December 2018, the country had installed 8,127 MW of renewable \nenergy capacity, or about 27.7% of the overall target. As regards wind power generation, only \n1,018 MW  or  34.1%  of  the  total  target  of  2,989  MW  had  been  met.  Major  private  sector \ninvestments in renewable energy, especially wind, are required to meet the government\u2019s clean \nenergy targets. As Thailand increases the share of intermittent renewable energy sources (solar \nand wind), battery energy storage will become an important technology to underpin the grid, \nproviding such services as frequency support, voltage support, ramping support, peak shaving, \nload shifting, and transmission deferral.3 \n \n4.  By the end of 2018, global storage deployment was about 8 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in terms \nof energy capacity, more than double the levels in 2017.4 In Southeast Asia, however, the lack of \npilot projects and a lag in regulatory regimes prevent widespread commercial deployment of the \nbattery storage technology seen in other parts of the world. \n \n5.  In July 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) received approval from the CTF Trust \nFund Committee for a $36.1 million private sector subprogram of integrated renewable energy \n \n1  Financing Partner: Climate Investment Funds.  \n2  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2019.

Administered through multilateral development \nbanks, including ADB, CTF is one of the largest funds helping developing countries fill financing \ngaps in climate change mitigation projects. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n6.  Project design. The project consists of a 10 MW wind power project with an integrated \n1.88 MWh pilot BESS. The wind farm consists of four wind turbines from Xinjiang Goldwind \nScience and Technology with a rated capacity of 2.5 MW each. The project company entered into \na power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), the Thai state-\nowned utility handling all distribution and retail sales outside the greater Bangkok area, for up to \n8.965 MW under the Ministry of Energy\u2019s very small power producer (VSPP) program. The PPA \nis automatically renewed every 5 years, and in addition to the wholesale tariff, the project receives \na tariff incentive (the so-called \"adder\") of B3.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), applicable for 10 years \nfrom the commercial operations date. The wind turbines reached commercial operations in April \n2019. \n \n7.  The 1.88 MWh BESS is a small pilot scheme comprising a lithium-ion battery with installed \ncapacity of 731 kWh and an UltraBattery with installed capacity of 1,152 kWh.6 The lithium-ion \nbattery has peak charge and discharge capacity of 731 kilowatts (kW). The UltraBattery has a \npeak charge capacity of 461 kW and a peak discharge capacity of 691 kW. Combining these \ntechnologies allows the project to benefit from both the high charge rate, high depth of discharge, \nand high durability of lithium-ion and the low energy capacity cost of the UltraBattery. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n8.  The project is in southern Thailand, one of the country\u2019s least developed regions, which \nsuffers from lack of investment, job opportunities, and access to basic services. The lack of \neconomic activity in the region has led to underinvestment in the local power system, which \ncontinues to experience energy shortages. The project will provide additional generation capacity \nto the region, help make the power network more resilient, and thus support economic growth. \n \n9.  Borrower and sponsor. Lomligor, the borrower, was set up to own, develop, construct, \nand operate the project. The project is wholly owned by BCPG, a leading renewable energy \ncompany in Thailand with 1,132 MW of capacity in operation and 256 MW under development as \nof August 2019. BCPG focuses on investments in renewable energy, including solar, geothermal, \nwind, biogas, and biomass. The project is part of the long-term growth strategy of BCPG, which \naims to expand investments in renewable energy generation and become one of the leading \nalternative energy companies in Southeast Asia. \n \n10.  BCPG is a core subsidiary of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and was set \nup in 2015 when Bangchak consolidated its renewable energy business into one subsidiary. \nBCPG is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand with a market capitalization of B36.18 billion.7 \nBangchak is BCPG\u2019s dominant shareholder with a 70% stake, and the Government of Thailand \n \n5  The CTF Trust Fund Committee approved the proposal on 20 July 2018 (Climate Investment Funds. DPSP III: \nIntegrated Renewable Energy and Energy Storage). \n6  UltraBattery. \n7  As of 7 October 2019. \n ", "3 \nindirectly owns 28% of BCPG through various entities. BCPG promotes gender equality in its \nbusiness: 17% of its board members (2 of 12 directors), 43% of its executive managers (3 of 7), \nand 46% of its senior managers (17 of 37) are women. Bangchak is rated A with a stable outlook \nby TRIS Rating. ADB has an existing relationship with BCPG through the Bangchak Solar Power \nProject approved in October 20108 and the Provincial Solar Power Project approved in June \n2012.9 \n \n11.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.10 Lomligor\u2019s founder, shareholders, managers, \nand major contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risk\u2014no unresolved or substantiated adverse media reports or other information related \nto them were found. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.11 \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n12.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) additional renewable energy \ncapacity developed and (ii) greenhouse gas emissions reduced from projected business-as-usual \nlevel by 2030.12 \n \n13.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the increased supply of renewable energy to \nThailand\u2019s domestic grid and the pilot demonstration of an integrated BESS. CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED. \n \n14.  Output. The project has three outputs: (i) a 10 MW wind power plant with integrated pilot \nBESS developed in Thailand; (ii) job opportunities for the local community, including for women, \ngenerated; and (iii) growth in the local and national economy supported. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority 3\u2014tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.13 Further, the project supports \ngreater mobilization of private sector participation in infrastructure. ADB\u2019s support for the project \nis in line with its country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 and country operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021  for  Thailand,  both  of  which  support  private  sector  development  and  energy \ninfrastructure, and respond to the needs and priorities of an upper-middle-income country.14 \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which emphasizes investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy \nprojects, and wider access to energy.15 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing \n$80 billion in cumulative financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2030. \n \n8  ADB.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n21.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance has two components: (i) a senior secured local currency loan \nof up to B235,550,648; and (ii) the administration of a concessional senior secured loan of up to \n$4,750,000 to be provided by CTF. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n23.  The participation of a concessional loan from CTF is necessary to improve the project\u2019s \nbankability and financial viability. Concessional financing increases risk-adjusted returns for the \nsponsor, considering the additional BESS-associated costs and risks. Minimum concessionality \nwas considered with regard to the pricing, size, and structure of the CTF loan, which will rank pari \npassu with ADB\u2019s loan but at a lower interest rate. The use of concessional finance is consistent \nwith the agreed principles of development finance institutions on the use of blended concessional \nfinance for private sector projects.18 \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the project bankable on a \nnonrecourse basis. ADB\u2019s experience in complex technical due diligence was important given \nthat this is the first wind power project with an integrated BESS in Thailand. ADB will offer a longer \ntenor than the participating commercial bank to help improve the debt service coverage ratios and \nthereby improve the project\u2019s financial viability. \n \n25.  Successful project financing will help set a precedent in Thailand for wind power projects \nwith an integrated BESS. The demonstration value of the pilot will be instrumental in lowering the \nperception of risk associated with a BESS, both in the Thai power industry and among the \nregulators. ADB\u2019s involvement and due diligence will ensure that the project is operated to \ninternational best practice standards and will perform to expectations over the project life. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation will also ensure compliance with its environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n26.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27.  ADB categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C),  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).19 \n \n28.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project, as well as measures set out in the safeguard reports and plans to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts. It also assessed Lomligor\u2019s (i) compliance with \nlocal regulations; and environmental, health, safety, and social policies and procedures; and \n(ii) past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It found the environmental and social measures and the institutional \ncapacity and commitment of the borrower to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts to be adequate. \n \n29.  An  independent  and  qualified  consultant  conducted  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit (ESCA) of the operating wind farm project and its associated facilities. The audit \nconfirmed that the site is not in any eco-sensitive zone or area. It did not identify any sensitive \nreceptors with significant environmental value in the project impact area. \n \n30.  An initial environmental evaluation (IEE) of the project, conducted in 2015 before it was \nbuilt,20 assessed the potential environmental impacts from its construction and operation and \nproposed corresponding mitigation measures. The ESCA (i) reviewed the IEE, (ii) assessed in \ndetail the ongoing and past activities at the project site, and (iii) identified gaps in environmental \nand social performance. It produced a corrective action plan to close these gaps and ensure \ncompliance with Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, such as upgrading the environmental \nmanagement plan in the IEE to an operational environmental and social management plan \n(ESMP). The ESMP will include a policy, a risk assessment process, environmental and social \ncontrols, monitoring and reporting procedures, stakeholder engagement, social development, and \na grievance redress mechanism that align with the Safeguard Policy Statement. Additionally, the \nborrower will align its labor and gender policies with the applicable regulatory requirements, ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), and internationally recognized core labor standards.21 These \nactions will be detailed in the project corrective action plan. \n \n31.  The project will not result in physical or economic displacement. The land for the wind \nturbines and associated facilities was privately owned and purchased from 2016 to 2018 through \na willing buyer, willing seller arrangement. The ESCA confirmed that no legacy or current issues, \nnor dependencies associated with the project land exist. PEA\u2019s 33-kilovolt transmission line is \n2.6 kilometers long, lies within PEA\u2019s right-of-way and along the public road, and connects the \nproject to the PEA grid. Hence, no involuntary resettlement issues arising from the project were \nfound. The project and its associated facilities are not in an area owned or used by indigenous \npeople, so impacts on indigenous people are not envisaged. \n \n \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n20 The IEE was prepared at the initiative of the project company (an impact assessment of the project is not required \nby law) to show compliance with local environmental regulations. \n21 ADB. 2003.

Lomligor commits to implement measures to promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development (1998), including (i) women\u2019s employment targets for both construction and \noperation, and (ii) development of an anti-sexual harassment policy and implementation plan. \nLomligor will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n33.  Lomligor will establish and maintain a project-specific ESMP satisfactory to ADB before \nany disbursement. The ESMP will set out requirements for compliance with national labor laws \nand,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy,  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards. The ESMP will also contain requirements for information disclosure, consultation with \naffected people, and a grievance redress mechanism in line with ADB requirements. The borrower \nwill report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws, and (ii) the \nmeasures taken. Project-related reporting and disclosure will follow ADB requirements.22 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  Lomligor and the project sponsor were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best \ninternational practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n35.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n36.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),23 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nThailand has no objection to the proposed assistance to Lomligor. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \nB235,550,648 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nLomligor Company Limited for the Southern Thailand Wind Power and Battery Energy Storage \nProject in Thailand, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n[\u25cf] December 2019\n \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 1966.
