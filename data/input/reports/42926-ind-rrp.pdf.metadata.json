The  United  Guaranty  Corporation  (UGC),  a  fully  owned \nsubsidiary  of  the  American  International  Group,  the  National  Housing \nBank of India (NHB), and the International Finance Corporation, will also \nbe shareholders of IMGC. \n\nIncrease  Access  to  Housing.  Demand  for  housing  in  India  is  high. \nHowever,  access  to  housing  is  limited  to  certain  segments  of  the \npopulation, such as middle- and higher-income groups (typically located \nin  urban  areas),  with  an  emphasis  on  salaried  employees  of  large \ncompanies  or  well-established  employers.  By  sharing  risk  with \nmortgage  lenders  through  guarantees,  lenders  will  be  encouraged  to \npenetrate broader market segments, where demand is equally high, and \noffer access to mortgage loans on more flexible terms and conditions. \n \nImprove Affordability. Typically, mortgage lenders require a minimum \ndown payment of 20% or more of the house value. In practice, lenders\u2019 \ndown  payment  requirements  are  much  higher \nfor  nontraditional \nborrower  segments.  Many  borrowers  in  lower-income  or  self-employed \nsegments are either denied loans or have had to aggregate large down \npayments through family contributions or expensive quasi-legal funding \nsources. The proposed investment will help to improve the affordability \nof  homes,  as  a  lender  will  be  able  to  provide  larger  loans,  while  being \nprotected  from  this  additional  risk  through  a  mortgage  guarantee.  A \nlarger loan will reduce the overall cost of housing to a borrower over the \nlife  of  the  loan.  Additionally,  with  the  risk  protection  offered  through  a \nmortgage guarantee, a lender may be more willing to offer lower interest \nrates to borrowers.   \n \nMeet Need for Housing Stock in India. Housing is in chronic shortage \nin India due to pressures from population growth and high urbanization \nrates. The 11th Five Year Plan Working Committee for the Government \nnoted that in 2007 there was a shortage of 24.71 million housing units in \nurban  areas  and  47.43  million  units  in  rural  areas.  By  expanding  the \navailability  of  mortgage  financing,  the  pace  and  number  of  home \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment and \nSafeguard Policies \n \nUse of Proceeds \n\n  \nRationale and \nJustification \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nconstruction  projects  is  likely  to  increase.  This  will,  in  turn,  increase \nemployment  in  the  construction  and  real  estate  sectors.  In  India,  the \nconstruction  sector  is  a  large  contributor  to  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP).  It  is  estimated  that  for  every  Indian  rupee  invested  in  housing, \nRs0.78 is added to the GDP.   \n \nBroaden  and  Strengthen  the  Housing  Finance  Sector.  A  mortgage \nguarantee  industry  is  an  important  component  of  housing  finance \nsystems in many developed markets. Mortgage guarantees will diminish \nrisk in the banking system in India through the reduction of credit risk on \nbanks\u2019 portfolios. Additionally, mortgage lenders are expected to benefit \nfrom a reduction in capital risk weights under Basel II through the use of \nmortgage  guarantees.  Finally,  market  underwriting  practices  are \nexpected  to  be  standardized  and  strengthened,  given  that  IMGC  will \nrequire  lenders  to  adhere  to  its  underwriting  standards  and  reporting \nrequirements.  Over  the  long  term  this  standardization  may  help  to \nbroaden  the  secondary  market  for  mortgage  portfolios,  including  the \nsecuritization market. \n  \nSupport  Government  Objectives.  The  proposed  investment  will \nsupport  Government  and  regulator  objectives.  First,  IMGC  will  help  to \naddress  the  severe  shortage  of  housing  and  housing  finance  in  India, \nwhich  is  acknowledged  by  the  Government  to  be  one  of  the  most \npressing issues in India today. Second, recognizing the value of creating \nthe  Government  has  spent \na  healthy  housing \nconsiderable  time  studying  and  developing  guidelines  for  a  mortgage \nguarantee  industry.  Regulators  have  released  final  guidelines  for  the \ncreation of this industry and IMGC is expected to be the first mortgage \nguarantee  company  established  in  India.  Given  that  IMGC  will  have \ndatabases  that  capture  loan  performance,  it  may  also  provide  value  to \nregulators by keeping them apprised of higher risk lending trends which \ncould have an adverse impact on the mortgage market.  \n \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  conducted  comprehensive \ndue  diligence  to  determine  the  viability  of  the  proposed  financial \nassistance.  Overall,  the  risks  outlined  below  can  be  regarded  as \nacceptable.   \n \n(i) \n\nfinance  sector, \n\nStart-up.  IMGC  may  encounter  risks  generally  associated  with \nstart-up companies, including insufficient demand for its product, \noperational  inefficiencies,  and  credit  risk.  These  risks  are \nconsidered to be reasonable and are expected to be mitigated, in \npart,  by  the  participation  of  the  strategic  investor,  UGC,  which \nhas  a  history  of  successful  operations  in  international  markets. \nIMGC  will  work  closely  with  lenders  to  tailor  its  products  and \nservices \nthe \nattractiveness  of  its  mortgage  guarantee  product.  Additionally, \nmarket  demand  is  expected  for  the  product,  given  its  ability  to \nprovide capital relief for banks under Basel II.  \n\nlender\u2019s  needs, \n\nincreasing \n\nto  each \n\nthereby \n\n \nRisks \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\niii\n\nMortgage  industry  performance.  A  severe  downturn  in  the \neconomy  and  the  mortgage  market  would  impact  on  the \nprofitability of IMGC. Although relatively young, India\u2019s mortgage \nmarket  has  performed  well.  The  percentage  of  loans  that  are \nnonperforming  in  the  mortgage  market  is  currently  at  about \n2.5%.  Underwriting  practices,  although  not  uniform,  are \nconsidered  to  be  good.  IMGC  will  help  to  improve  underwriting \nstandards. Thus, this risk is considered to be acceptable. \n\nRegulatory risk. Regulatory risk is considered acceptable. Local \nlaws  allow  foreclosure  through  an  extra-judicial  process  and  a \ntitle deed registration system is in existence in India. Guidelines \nfor  the  mortgage  guarantee  industry  were  issued  in  February \n2008.  While  the  guidelines  are  considered  to  be  acceptable  to \nindustry  participants,  there  is  a  risk  (given  that  the  regulations \nhave been tailored for a new industry in India) that there may be \nsome  ambiguities  in  the  guidelines  that  will  need  to  be  clarified \nas IMGC begins operations. Regulatory risk can be mitigated, in \npart, by the presence of ADB (as well as IFC and the NHB), as \nshareholders in IMGC, who will assist the company in clarifying \nany uncertainties.  \n\nPotential conflict of interest. The NHB will initially be the single \nlargest  equity  investor  in  IMGC,  and  it  is  also  the  regulator  of \nhousing finance companies, which are expected to be customers \nof IMGC. NHB will not regulate the mortgage guarantee industry.  \nContractual documentation will include safeguards to prevent the \nNHB from having any undue influence on the company. \n\nMacroeconomic  risk.  The  Indian  economy  has  performed \nstrongly since 2003, making it one of the fastest-growing global \neconomies.  Major  challenges \ninflation, \nmanaging budget deficits, and further appreciation of the rupee, \nwhich would be likely to have an adverse impact on exports and \ncorporate profitability in export-oriented sectors. \n\ninclude  containing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for  your approval the following report and recommendation for  an equity \ninvestment  of  up  to  Rs800  million  (approximately  $18.58  million)  in  the  India  Mortgage \nGuarantee  Company  (IMGC)  located  in  India.1  IMGC  will  be  established  to  provide \nguarantees  to  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs)  and  banks  with  respect  to  their \nmortgage loans.2 The design and monitoring framework for this investment is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nThe Economy \n\n1. \n\nOverview and Outlook \n\n2. \nOverview.  India  has  one  of  the  world\u2019s  fastest-growing  economies  with  average \ngrowth  rates  of  8%  since  2003.  The  country  has  also  made  substantial  progress  in \nreducing absolute poverty by half, and improving literacy and health conditions. The Indian \neconomy  is  experiencing  structural  changes  with  the  decline  in  agricultural  productivity, \nwhich  has  been  a  historic  contributor  to  the  economy.  By  2007,  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) growth was supported by the services sector, which represented 56% of GDP, and \nthe  industry  sector,  which  represented  27%  of  GDP.  The  private  sector  continues  to \nexpand in India as a result of the improved investment climate. From FY2002 to FY2006, \nprivate sector investment as a percentage of gross capital formation increased from 18.6% \nto 27%. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  has  also  made  progress  in  its  fiscal  performance.  The  fiscal \ndeficit of the central Government has declined from 5.9% in FY2002 to 3.1% in FY2007, \nwhile  revenue  deficit  has  declined  from  4.4%  to  1.4%.  The  overall  fiscal  deficit  of  states \nhas  fallen  from  4.1%  in  FY2002  to  2.3%  in  FY2007.  The  tax-GDP  ratio  of  the  central \nGovernment has improved, increasing from 8.8% of GDP in FY2002 to 11.7% in FY2007. \n \nThe  Indian  economy  has  become  more  competitive  externally  as  a  result  of \n4. \nsignificant trade liberalization and reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers over the years. \nThe trade-GDP ratio has increased from 23.3% of GDP in FY2002 to 33.5% in FY2007, \nwhich  is  a  reflection  of  the  growing  openness  of  the  Indian  economy.  Foreign  exchange \nreserves have increased rapidly, from less than $100 billion in FY2003 to $314 billion as of \n16 May 2008.  \n \n5. \nOutlook.  The  economy  is  currently  experiencing  inflationary  pressures  and  a \nmarginal slowdown; however, given the solid fundamentals of the economy, it is expected \nthat  growth  will  be  maintained  at  strong  levels.  Moderation  of  growth  in  the  economy  is \nprimarily  due  to  external  developments,  including  a  rise  in  interest  rates,  global  financial \nproblems, a slowing of the US economy, and steep increases in commodity prices. Thus, \n\n                                                 \n1  A  name  for  the  company  has  not  been  determined,  as  the  company  can  only  receive  approval  from  the \n\nRegistrar of Companies after board approvals have been obtained from the respective shareholders. \n\n2   An  investment  of  $10  million  for  IMGC  was  initially  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in  2002  (ADB. \n2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Equity \nInvestment  to  India  for  the  India  Mortgage  Guarantee  Company.  Manila  [EI  7180-IND].  IMGC  was  not \nestablished because the regulatory framework for the mortgage guarantee industry was never introduced.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nthe rate of GDP growth is expected to be about 7.5% for 2008.3 Inflation has been above \n7% since March 2008. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been using monetary policy \nmeasures, such as an increase in the cash reserve ratio and interest rates, to moderate \ninflation.  It  will  be  important  for  the  Government  to  maintain  control  of  its  subsidies, \nparticularly for food and oil, during this inflationary period.  \n \n\n2. \n\nChallenges \n\nDespite  strong  growth  in  recent  years,  there  remain  a  number  of  developmental \n6. \nchallenges  for  India.  First,  there  have  been  regional  disparities  in  growth  and  social \nindicators.  India  will  need  to  support  employment  creation  throughout  the  entire  country. \nSecond,  the  agriculture  sector  has  performed  weakly  and  will  need  to  be  supported \nthrough  rural  development  initiatives.  Third,  education  and  health  initiatives  require \ncontinued emphasis. Finally, India continues to have infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly \nin  urban  areas,  and  suffers  from  a  lack  of  adequate  long-term  funds  for  infrastructure \ninvestment. As the country urbanizes rapidly, infrastructure will continue to be strained and \nthe  availability  of  affordable  and  adequate  housing  will  continue  to  diminish  if  not \nsupported through a variety of public and private initiatives.    \n \nB. \n\nThe Housing and Mortgage Market  \n\n1. \n\nHousing Demand and Supply \n\n7. \nDemand.  Demand  for  housing  in  India  is  high  and  is  expected  to  continue  to \nincrease. There are a number of trends that support growth in demand. Foremost among \nthese  factors  is  the  strong  performance  of  the  economy  and  subsequent  increase  in \npersonal  income  levels.  Salary  increases  for  individuals  in  metropolitan  areas  have \naveraged  about  20%  per  year  since  2005.  4  More  broadly,  McKinsey  Global  Institute \nestimates  that  average  real  household  disposable  income  in  India  will  grow  from \nRs113,744  per  annum  in  2005  to  Rs318,896  per  annum  by  2025,  which  represents  a \ncompound annual growth rate of 5.3%.  5 As a result, the middle class is rapidly growing in \nIndia. Concurrent with the growth of the middle class is a shift in the traditional aversion to \ndebt, particularly for home ownership. Combined with strong household savings (currently \nat  approximately  28%  of  disposable  income),  people  are  increasingly  aspiring  to  own \nhomes (footnote 5).  \n \nChanges  in  the  demography  of  India  are  also  expected  to  bolster  demand  for \n8. \nhousing.  India  is  still  in  the  initial  stages  of  urban  growth;  in  2003,  only  26%  of  the \npopulation lived in urban areas. By 2023, the number of people living in urban centers is \nexpected  to  grow  to  33%  (an  increase  of  225  million  people),  which  is  still  a  lower \nurbanization rate than that of many developed countries.6 In addition to traditional urban \ncenters  in  India,  urbanization  is  also  expected  to  occur  in  smaller  and  medium-sized \ntowns. The population growth rate, which will likely overtake that of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, will also put pressure on housing stock in India. Estimates indicate that India\u2019s \npopulation  will  increase  from  1.22  billion  by  2013  to  1.37  billion  by  2023  (footnote  6). \n\n                                                 \n3  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2008.

Asia  Pacific  View:  Asia  Pacific  Real  Estate  Investment \n\nStrategy. Hong Kong (September). \n\nRatings.  \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nAnother demographic factor that is contributing to demand for housing includes a youthful \npopulation. With the average age below 30 years old until 2023, India will have one of the \nyoungest  populations  in  Asia.  Given  that  the  standard  age  for  purchasing  a  home  is \nbetween  20  and  39  years  old,  and  that  younger  people  in  India  are  moving  away  from \ntraditional  extended-family  living  arrangements,  it  is  anticipated  that  demand  for  new \nhousing will remain strong. \n \n9. \nSupply.  Housing  stock  in  India  has  historically  lagged  behind  demand.  The \nhousing  construction  sector  has  been  relatively  unorganized,  with  most  construction \nundertaken  by  small,  local  contractors  and  often  by  individuals  themselves.  Builders  in \ncertain  areas  have  been  required  to  obtain  more  than  50  approvals,  thus  delaying  the \napproval process to between 120 and 450 days and prohibiting formal construction. Until \napproximately  2006,  the  unorganized  sector  accounted  for  70%  of  all  housing  units  that \nwere constructed.  7 The larger-scale developers active in the market were niche players \nand  typically  focused  on  specific  cities.  Another  factor  that  has  limited  the  supply  of \nhousing stock has been regulations that have created an artificial scarcity of land in India. \nFor  example,  the  Urban  Land  Ceiling  and  Regulation  Act  of  1976  was  introduced  to \nensure that large tracts of land were not concentrated in a few hands. Land in excess of \ncertain limits was turned over to the state for development. The act resulted in preventing \ntracts  of  land  from  entering  the  market  and  inefficient  redistribution  of  land  after \nacquisition.  In  Mumbai,  1,300  hectares  of  land  were  acquired  by  the  state,  but  only  5% \nwas used over a period of 20 years, which has created overcrowded conditions and high \nproperty costs in this growing city. \n \nHousing  construction  increased  markedly  in  2005  with  the  introduction  of \n10. \namendments impacting the real estate regulations. First, 100% foreign direct investment in \nhousing and construction projects was permitted, which created badly needed sources of \nfunding  for  real  estate.  Second,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  allowed \nventure  capital  funds  to  invest  in  real  estate.  With  increasing  demand  and  the \naforementioned regulatory changes, the real estate development sector has become more \norganized,  and  larger  developers  with  projects  on  a  broader  scale  throughout  India  can \nnow  be  found.  Supply  of  housing  stock  was  also  facilitated  by  the  easing  of  some  land \nrestrictions  with  the  repealing  of  the  Urban  Land  Ceiling  and  Regulation  Act  of  1976  by \nmost states. 8 \n \n11. \nHousing  stock  growth  is  expected  to  be  strong  in  the  short  and  medium  term. \nCurrent housing stock is about 130 million units and is projected to grow at a compounded \nannual  growth  rate  of  3.37%  until  2012.  The  Credit  Rating  Information  Services  of  India \nLimited  (CRISIL),  one  of  India\u2019s  leading  rating  agencies  whose  majority  shareholder  is \nStandard and Poor\u2019s,  notes that between 2007  and 2011  approximately 4.6  million  units \nper annum will be added to the base housing stock.9 This will increase the housing stock \nto  approximately  153  million  units  by  the  end  of  2011.  Despite  the  solid  growth  pattern, \nthere is still a severe shortage of housing units in India.

In  particular,  there  has  been  a  steep \nescalation in home prices in metropolitan areas since about 2005. Home prices increased \nat  a  compounded  annual  growth  rate  of  between  30%  and  40%  during  this  period.  For \ninstance, in South Mumbai, the price increased from Rs18,000 per square foot (ft2) in 2005 \nto  Rs25,000  per  ft2  in  2006.11  Other  cities,  such  as  Bangalore,  Chennai,  Delhi,  and \nHyderabad, have experienced price increases, but at lower levels.   \n \n13. \nAffordability, particularly in Delhi and Mumbai, has deteriorated since the beginning \nof 2006 as a consequence of high property prices. Thus, although salaries have increased \nby  an  average  of  20%  per  year  since  approximately  2005,  the  affordability  index  has \ndeclined from 4.4 times to up to 5.5 times.12 Some buyers simply cannot afford homes in \nurban areas, while others will have a higher debt burden upon obtaining a mortgage loan. \nSome banks and HFCs have offered mortgage loans at higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios \nto  accommodate  more  borrowers,  while  other  banks  have  been  reluctant  to  take  on \nadditional risk associated with higher LTV levels.13 Overall, and despite the sharp increase \nin property prices, housing affordability has greatly improved in India. In 1996, the value of \na home in India was about 16 times an individual\u2019s annual income.  \n \n14.  More  recently,  property  prices  in  India  have  started  to  decrease  slightly  in  some \nlocations.  This  is  primarily  due  to  higher  inflation  and  interest  rates.  However,  property \nprices  in  suburbs  of  large  cities  are  increasing  as  people  are  relocating  offices  from \ndowntown areas. In general, affordability in the medium term is expected to remain stable \ndue to the continued growth in incomes coupled with a moderation in property prices.  \n \n15.  Mortgage  Market.  At  approximately  6%  of  GDP,  India  currently  has  one  of  the \nlowest  mortgage  penetration  rates  in  Asia.14  Historically,  a  number  of  factors  have \nhampered  the  growth  of  the  housing  construction  industry  (as  noted  above),  and  the \ndevelopment of the mortgage market. With respect to the mortgage market development, \nthe legal and regulatory framework for foreclosure, titling, and registration has been weak. \nHigh  transaction  costs  associated  with  registering  a  home  discouraged  home  buyers. \nFinally, the economy was not conducive to mortgage lending due to high interest rates and \nthe absence of a mass consumer class that demanded housing. Consequently, financial \ninstitutions  simply  did  not  offer  mortgage  products  in  large  quantities  for  a  number  of \nyears. \n \n16. \nThe  mortgage  market  has  grown  substantially  since  FY2002.  The  sector  has \nexpanded as a result of an improved regulatory environment that strengthened the ability \nof banks to foreclose more quickly on nonperforming assets. Additionally, macroeconomic \ngrowth and lower interest rates have led to increases in mortgage lending. Other factors \ncontributing  to  the  expansion  of  the  mortgage  market  include  government  tax  incentives \n\n                                                 \n11  Global Property Guide.  2008.

A lower \n\naffordability index indicates that a property is more affordable to the buyer. \n\n13  Market commentary noted that some banks were offering loans with LTVs of up to 90% and 100%. \n14  Warnock, Veronica C., and Francis E.

CRISIL reports that the estimated growth rate in mortgage lending for \nFY2007 was 18% with total mortgage disbursements at $25 billion (footnote 10). Mortgage \ndisbursements are projected to grow at an annual rate of 15%\u201320% to over $40 billion by \n2012 (footnote 10).  Growth rates have started to slightly slow as a result of higher interest \nrates; however, the overall outlook for the market remains very positive.   \n \n17. \nDespite the rapid increase in mortgage lending, the percentage of nonperforming \nloans  (NPLs)  is  low  in  India  and  represents  approximately  2.5%  of  lenders\u2019  mortgage \nportfolios.15  As  seen  in  Table  1,  NPLs  for  HFCs  are  currently  below  2%  on  average. \nHowever, it  should be noted that loans offered  since 2004 comprise 71% of India\u2019s total \noutstanding portfolio, and have thus not had a chance to age for long. Additional details of \nthe mortgage market are provided in Appendix 2. \n \n\nTable 1: Nonperforming Loans for Housing Finance Companies \n(%) \n\nGross NPLs  \n\n \n\n \n\n2006/07 \n(90 dpd) \n0.92 \n2.58 \n1.56 \n1.33 \n1.71 \n\n2004/05 \n(90 dpd) \n1.14 \n4.43 \n2.87 \n1.74 \n2.00 \n\n2003/04 \n(180 dpd) \n0.95 \n3.59 \n2.70 \n1.18 \n1.66 \n\n2000/01 \n(180 dpd)a\n0.85 \n3.44 \n3.52 \n1.50 \n1.66 \n\n2001/02 \n(180 dpd) \n0.95 \n3.90 \n3.62 \n1.40 \n1.80 \n\n2002/03 \n(180 dpd) \n0.99 \n4.11 \n3.21 \n1.01 \n1.84 \n\nItem  \nHDFC \nLICHF \nCanara Bank \nDHFL \nAverage GNPL \ndpd  =  days  delinquent,  DHFL=  Dewan  Housing  Finance  Corporation,  GNPL  =  gross  nonperforming  loans, \nHDFC  =  Housing  Development  Finance  Corporation,  LICHF  =  LIC  Housing  Finance  Corporation,  NPL  = \nnonperforming loan. \na Until 2004, loans were considered to be nonperforming after being delinquent for more than 180 days. \nSources: Annual reports, CRISIL Research. \n \n18. \nUnderwriting  practices  in  India  are  considered  to  be  good  and  are  generally \nconservative.    The  market  is  relatively  young  and,  at  6%  of  GDP,  lenders  have  not \npursued offering mortgage loans to borrowers considered to be of low credit quality.  For \ninstance, \nlow \nin  mortgage \ndocumentation, no documentation, or stated income basis, as was recently common in the \nUnited States for borrowers who were considered to be subprime.  LTVs have been low \nand are at an industry average of 75%.  LTVs are often overstated because fees, such as \nstamp duties, are included in the principal amount. Payment shocks to borrowers due to \nadjustable  rate  mortgages  (ARMs)  are  not  common,  despite  the  prevalence  of  ARMs  in \nthe Indian market.  Lenders adjust the tenor of a loan subsequent to changes in interest \nrates.

There  are  currently  45  HFCs  registered  with  the  NHB,  the  largest \n                                                 \n15 Nayak, Mahesh.  2008.  Life After Bad Debt.  Business Today (5 February).  India. \n16 Foreign banks have withdrawn from retail assets businesses as their distribution network is limited and costs \n\nof funds is higher than that of Indian players. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nbeing the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC, the mortgage market leader \nin India) and the LIC Housing Finance Corporation (LICHF). Other HFCs are much smaller \nand focus on niche markets or geographic regions. Prior to 1998, commercial banks were \nnot permitted to offer mortgage loans. Thus, HFC\u2019s were the dominant mortgage lenders \nin India for a number of years.  \n \n20.  With rising demand for mortgages and growing incomes, banks began to focus on \nrapidly building their mortgage portfolios and have now surpassed HFCs as the dominant \nlender segment.17 Additionally, capital adequacy requirements, access to liquidity, and tax \ntreatment differ between HFCs and banks, giving banks a competitive edge in the market. \nSources  of  funding  for  HFCs  have  included  deposits,  institutional  borrowings  (both \ndomestic and international), commercial bank borrowings, refinancing from the NHB, and \ntheir own capital. Some of the larger HFCs, such as HDFC, have been able to gain access \nto  multilateral  funding,  the  syndicated  bank  market,  and  funds  from  investors  through \nbonds backed by mortgages.  \n \nDespite the number of participants in the market, 70% of all new home loans are \n21. \ncurrently  originated  by  four  lenders:  HDFC,  LICHF,  ICICI  Bank,  and  the  State  Bank  of \nIndia.  The  commonalities  between  these  top-tier  lenders  are  access  to  large  pools  of \nreasonably  priced  funds,  and  proficiency  of  local  knowledge  on  home  construction  rules \nand  land  laws.  Additionally,  advanced  information  and  communications  technology  has \nplayed an important role in augmenting the geographical spread of these lenders.  \n \n22. \nThe  phenomenal  growth  in  mortgage  disbursements  in  recent  years  has  been \nsupported  by  the  availability  of  alternative  distribution  channels.  In  the  past,  the  major \ndistribution  channel  has  been  the  branch  network  of  the  HFCs;  the  number  of  branches \nwas  limited  and  distribution  reach  was  not  very  wide.  Over  the  last  few  years,  however, \nthere  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  banks\u2019  own  distribution  centers. \nAdditionally,  direct  sales  team  (DST)  models  have  become  more  popular.  DST  models \nhave  offices  in  specific  locations  with  sales  agents  under  direct  management  of  lender \nsales  managers  at  that  office.  There  has  also  been  a  proliferation  of  direct  sales  agents \n(DSAs), which have contributed greatly to expanding lender reach. DSAs typically target \nindividuals  who  want  doorstep  service.  As  competition  has  intensified  in  the  housing \nfinance  industry,  several  large  lenders  have  delegated  sales  to  DSAs  in  order  to  build \nbusiness. \n \nThe distribution model for most lenders is in the form of a hub and spoke model, \n23. \nwhere  branches,  DSTs,  and  DSAs  focus  on  sourcing  business  while  credit  appraisal  is \nhandled  by  specialized  units  of  underwriters  at  central  lender  locations.  This  enables \nspecialization within the organization and improves efficiencies. The branch locations are \ntypically  aligned  with  regional  offices,  which  are  commonly  located  in  major  cities \n(Bangalore,  Chennai,  Calcutta,  Delhi,  Mumbai,  and  Pune).  Given  that  land  and  building \nlaws  vary  from  state  to  state,  local  knowledge  is  very  important  in  order  to  successfully \npenetrate specific markets.  \n \nE. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\n24. \nThe  legal  system  of  India  provides  a  framework  for  transfer  of  property  and \nrecognition of title. There is a lengthy history in India of private ownership of property and \n\n                                                 \n17  CRISIL Ratings. 2007. Mortgage Finance: A Safe Haven for Lenders? Mumbai. \n\n\f7 \n\nland. Real estate is heavily regulated, with over 100 laws that address various aspects of \nthe  real  estate  sector.  While  the  central  Government  may  issue  guidelines,  individual \nstates have the option, but not the obligation, to implement such guidelines. Foreclosure \nlaws  were  strengthened  in  India  with  the  introduction  of  the  Securitisation  and \nReconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  Act  of  2002, \nwhich  improved  the  ability  of  banks  to  foreclose  more  quickly  on  nonperforming  assets \nthrough an extra-judicial process. Appendix 3 has additional information on the legal and \nregulatory framework for the property sector. \n \n25.  Mortgage  Guarantee  Industry  Guidelines.  In  February  2008,  the  RBI  released \nthe Guidelines on Registration and Operations of a Mortgage Guarantee Company under \nSection  45(1)(b)  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  Act  1934.18  The  guidelines  provide  the \nnecessary  regulatory  framework  for  establishing  a  mortgage  guarantee  industry  in  India. \nThe primary provisions are summarized below: \n \n\nA  mortgage  guarantee  company  will  function  essentially  as  a  monoline \nguarantee  company  (90%  of  a  mortgage  guarantee  company\u2019s  gross  income \nmust be derived from the mortgage guarantee business). \n\nThe maximum LTV of a loan that can be guaranteed is 90%. \n\nCapital adequacy is set at 10% of risk in force.19 \n\nA mortgage guarantee company will create and maintain contingency reserves \nand  shall  appropriate  each  year  at  least  40%  of  the  fees  earned  during  that \naccounting year or 25% of the net profit, whichever is higher.  These amounts \nwill  be  appropriated  for  a  minimum  period  of  seven  years.    Additionally,  the \ncontingency reserve must be built up to 5% of the total outstanding mortgage \nguarantee commitments. \n\nProvisions will be set aside when a guarantee is invoked in an amount equal to \nthe amount of invocation. \n\nProvisions will also be established for those incurred but not reported losses or \nfor  those  loans  where  there  is  a  potential  for  a  loss  when  a  default  has \noccurred.  The amount of provision will be determined on an actuarial basis. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nThe timing for a claim payment is not clearly specified and  will be  negotiated \nbetween  the  mortgage  guarantee  company  and  the  guaranteed  lenders; \nhowever, a claim may be invoked after a loan is 90 days delinquent. \n\n \n(viii)  The mortgage guarantee will be in the form of a tripartite agreement between \n\nthe individual borrower, the lender, and the mortgage guarantee company. \n\n \n(ix)  Mortgage guarantee companies will be responsible for verification of customer \n\ndata and collateral. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18 The guidelines may be accessed on the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s website at www.rbi.org.in. \n19  Risk  in  force  represents  the  maximum  dollar  or  local  currency  amount  of  principal  loss  covered  by  a \n\nmortgage guarantee.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n26.  While the guidelines are considered acceptable by industry participants, there are \na few issues that are not clearly specified or addressed. For instance, capital relief is not a \nspecific  feature  of  the  regulations;  however,  the  Basel  II  Revised  International  Capital \nFramework  (Basel  II)  does  qualify  rated  guarantees  as  a  risk  mitigating  tool  and  allows \ncapital relief. Basel II guidelines will come into force in India in calendar year 2008-2009. \nSecond,  guarantees  are  not  mandatory,  regardless  of  LTV  levels.20  Finally,  given  the \ntripartite  nature  of  the  mortgage  guarantee  agreement,  it  would  be  difficult  to  provide \nmortgage  guarantees  on  a  pooled  basis  (where  a  mortgage  guarantee  would  cover  a \nportfolio of loans). \n \n\nIII. \n\nINDIA MORTGAGE GUARANTEE COMPANY \n\nOverview.

IMGC will \nsupport the expansion of housing in India.  \n \n28. \nmortgage lenders in India, and this will achieve the following: \n \n\nThe primary objective of IMGC will be to offer tailored credit mitigation products to \n\nMake housing more accessible to qualified younger buyers. \n\nIncrease  accessibility  to  mortgage  loans  in  underserved  regions  and \ncommunities. \n\nIncrease  accessibility  to  mortgage  loans  for  entrepreneurs  and  the  self-\nemployed. \n\nStimulate the housing resale market.  \n\nEncourage  lenders  to  bring  yields  lower  on  loans  that  have  a  mortgage \nguarantee.  \n\n \nA. \n\nOwnership and Management \n\n1. \n\nProposed Shareholding Structure \n\n29. \nIMGC  will  be  organized  as  a  private  limited  company.  It  will  require  an  initial \nestimated capital base  of Rs1.2 billion (approximately $27.9 million). IMGC will have the \nfollowing initial shareholders: the NHB, the United Guaranty Corporation (UGC), ADB, and \nthe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC).  UGC  is  the  strategic  shareholder  in  IMGC, \nand  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  American  International  Group  (AIG),  which  is \nglobally  one  of  the  largest  financial  and  insurance  companies.  UGC  also  has  extensive \nexperience  in  mortgage  insurance  and  guarantee  markets  in  the  US  and  elsewhere \ninternationally.  Details  of  the  initial  shareholders  are  presented  in  Appendix  4.    The \nestimated initial investment commitments and shareholding structure are shown in Table \n2. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n20 For instance, in Hong Kong, China, loans with LTVs of over 70% are required to obtain mortgage insurance. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n \n(v) \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nTable 2: Initial Investment Commitments and Shareholding Structure \n\nShareholder \n\nNational Housing Bank  \n\nUnited Guaranty Corporation \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nInternational Finance Corporation \n\nTotal \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nInitial Equity Contribution \n($ million) \n\nOwnership \n(%) \n\n11.98 \n\n11.43 \n\n2.23 \n\n2.23 \n\n27.87 \n\n43.00 \n\n41.00 \n\n8.00 \n\n8.00 \n\n100.00 \n\n2. \n\nBoard of Directors and Management \n\n30. \nBoard of Directors. IMGC\u2019s board of directors, expected to be composed of eight \nmembers,  will  be  the  company\u2019s  governing  body.  ADB  and  IFC  will  each  have  one \ndirector, and the NHB and UGC will each have three directors. The chairman of the board \nwill  be  nominated  by  the  NHB  after  consultation  with  the  initial  shareholders  and  upon \napproval by the board of directors. An audit committee will be established and will report \ndirectly  to  the  board.  The  audit  committee  is  expected  to  be  comprised  of  at  least  three \nnonexecutive directors, at least one of whom will be a chartered accountant.  \n \n31. \nEmployees. It is expected that the managing director will be identified by UGC and \nwill  then  be  approved  by  the  board  of  directors.  The  managing  director  will  have  an \nexecutive  team  of  approximately  five  directors  reporting  to  him  or  her,  including  a  chief \noperating officer, chief risk officer, vice-president of finance, chief commercial officer, and \ncompany secretary and head of legal affairs. UGC has a representative office in New Delhi \nand  is  conducting  preliminary  work  in  anticipation  of  IMGC\u2019s  incorporation.  Several \nexperienced mortgage staff have been hired and will become key members of IMGC.  \n \nB. \n\nCorporate Governance  \n\n1. \n\nRisk Management  \n\n32. \nIMGC  will  develop  a  comprehensive  risk  management  system  that  covers  credit \nand  operational  risk.  A  separate  risk  management  unit  will  be  formed  under  a  chief  risk \nofficer  (CRO).  The  risk  management  unit  will  consist  of  approximately  three  divisions: \ncredit policy and portfolio analytics, underwriting, and claims and recovery. The CRO will \nreport directly to the managing director and will also report to the head global risk officer of \nUGC located in the US. \n \nC. \n\nConcept \n\nA  mortgage  guarantee  guarantees  lenders  against  partial  loss  from  borrower \n33. \ndefault.

Market  Demand  for  Product.  In  order  to  meet  its  objectives,  IMGC  must  be \ncommercially  viable  to  achieve  success.  There  are  three  factors  that  are  expected  to \ngenerate  demand  for  a  mortgage  guarantee  product:  (i)  high  levels  of  demand  from  all \nsegments for housing in India, (ii) capital relief for lenders, and (iii) credit enhancement for \nmortgage-backed securitizations (MBS). \n \n35. \nFirst,  as  noted,  housing  is  in  great  demand  in  India.  Demographic  trends  and  a \npositive  macroeconomic  outlook contribute to projected growth in the  market.  The larger \nlenders  are  currently  competing  in  the  upper-  and  middle-income  salaried  and  self-\nemployed  segments  of  the  market.  Consequently,  lenders  have  been  reducing  fees  and \nmargins and, as a result, are earning lower yields in this market. Some lenders are starting \nto expand into the lower-middle income and the self-employed nonprofessional segments \nwhere yields are higher but, with the exception of a few niche HFCs, most lenders have \nyet to really tap this market. As can be seen in Figure 2, the self-employed market has the \nhighest  level  of  household  formation  but  one  of  the  lowest  mortgage  penetration  rates. \nThus, there is ample demand and opportunity for growth in this market segment, which is \nexpected to become an increasingly important target market for lenders. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Market Segments Household Formation and Mortgage Penetration Rates \n\n0%\n\n8% \n\n55%\n\n30%\n\n37% \n\n70% \n\n0% \n\nSalaried \n\n50% \n\n40% \n\n30% \n\n20% \n\n70% \n\n60% \n\n80% \n\n10% \n\nSelf Employed\n\nContract Labor\n\nLoan Disbursements \n\nIncremental Household formation \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: CRISIL Research. \n \n \n36. \nSecond,  lenders  will  benefit  from  a  mortgage  guarantee  due  to  the  reduction  of \ncredit  risk  on  their  portfolio.  The  lower  risk  enables  them  to  reduce  the  provisions  for \nlosses on their portfolio. Lenders will also benefit substantially from the reduction in capital \nrisk weights under Basel ll if a mortgage guarantee is provided by a company that is rated \nAA or higher.21 Banks are currently required to hold 9% capital on a loan risk weighted at \n75%, which is an effective capital requirement of 6.75%. Under Basel II, the reduction to \n20%  risk  weight  would  lower  the  effective  capital  to  1.8%  on  the  covered  portion.  HFCs \nare required to hold capital of 12%  of the loan  amount  risk weighted  at  50%. Therefore, \nthe effective capital requirement is 6%. If the risk weight is reduced to 20%, the effective \ncapital requirement would be reduced to 1.2% on the covered portion of the loan. Savings \non  costs  associated  with  capital  and  provisions  requirements  can  then  be  deployed  to \noriginate new mortgage loans. An example of the actual cost savings to an HFC using a \nmortgage guarantee is presented in Appendix 6. \n \n37. \nFinally,  the  benefit  from  mortgage  guarantees  may  be  expanded  to  the  MBS \nmarket at a later date. As previously mentioned, the RBI guidelines require the mortgage \nguarantee to be in the form of a tripartite agreement between the individual borrower, the \nlender, and the mortgage guarantee company. Currently, this requirement makes it difficult \nfor  a  mortgage  guarantee  company  to  provide  guarantees  on  a  pool  or  portfolio  of \nmortgage  loans.  However,  should  the  regulators  modify  this  requirement,  mortgage \n\n                                                 \n21  The  Government  has  stated  that  Basel  II  guidelines  will  be  introduced  in  calendar  year  2008  to  2009  for \nbanks. NHB  has  yet to come  out  with  similar guidelines for HFCs. However, it has indicated that it  will  be \nreleasing similar guidelines concurrent with the implementation of Basel II.   \n\n\fguarantees could become an important form of credit enhancement for bonds backed by \nmortgages  or  MBS.  In  many  developed  countries,  mortgage  guarantees  or  mortgage \ninsurance are used in a first-loss position in MBS structures.  \n \n \nD. \n\nOperational Framework \n\n1. \n\nProducts \n\n38. \nIMGC  will  offer  a  partial  guarantee  on  mortgage  loans  covering  a  predetermined \npercentage of the outstanding mortgage  value.  The guarantee will be tailored to specific \nlenders'  needs.  It  may  take  the  form,  for  instance,  of  amortizing  at  the  same  rate  as  a \nmortgage loan so that a lender\u2019s risk exposure would remain constant at 80% for the life of \nthe  mortgage  loan.  Another  possible  product  is  for  the  mortgage  guarantee  coverage  to \nremain constant while the lender\u2019s exposure declines. The various product alternatives will \nbe refined after the company is incorporated. \n \n\n2. \n\nPricing \n\n39. \nGuarantee  fee  pricing  is  expected  to  be  the  foremost  concern  for  lenders  and \nborrowers in selecting to use a mortgage guarantee product. The fee will be paid upfront \nat the point when the mortgage is closed. The borrower will be responsible for paying the \nguarantee fee. The mortgage guarantee fee is expected to be included in the full amount \nof the mortgage loan.  Initial pricing of the product will be critical to its uptake and for the \nestablishment of benchmarks in the market for this product.  IMGC will focus on preserving \nthe  integrity  of  its  pricing  model  by  pricing  risk  accurately,  taking  into  account  the  full \nlending cycle and reaching the threshold return on equity for all programs.   \n \n\n3. \n\nGuarantee Eligibility \n\n40. \nIMGC  will  guarantee  only  those  loans  that  meet  its  own  underwriting  standards. \nBanks  and  HFCs  will  provide  IMGC  with  predetermined  data  from  the  borrower\u2019s \napplication,  which  IMGC  will  then  use  to  analyze  and  underwrite  each  mortgage  loan \nthrough an automated process. Given that borrower qualifications vary by lender, IMGC\u2019s \nundertaking will help to standardize the market. Bank or HFC underwriting practices and \nassociated  technology  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  are  in  line  with  prudent \nmortgage practices and are acceptable to IMGC. A master guarantee agreement (MGA) \nwill  be  signed  with  each  lender,  and  this  will  cover  the  key  risk  issues  that  the  lender  is \nexpected to address at the time of its assessment of the loan.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPortfolio Monitoring \n\n41. \nIMGC  will  monitor  the  loans  that  it  has  guaranteed.  It  will  receive  data  files  on  a \nperiodic basis (expected to be monthly) that include all information required to satisfy its \nmonitoring  needs.  This  information  may  include,  for  example,  current  loan  balances, \nprepayment, and delinquency data. The specific dataset for this file will be based on the \nUGC Standard International Dataset and will be predetermined with each lender. \n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\n5. \n\nClaims Settlement \n\n42. \nAccording to the RBI guidelines for the mortgage guarantee industry, the timing for \na claims payment is not specified and will be negotiated between the mortgage guarantee \ncompany  and  the  lenders;  however,  it  will  occur  no  earlier  than  after  a  loan  is  90  days \ndelinquent.  IMGC  will  be  made  aware  of  the  first  monthly  default  by  a  notice  from  the \nlender. Additionally, data from clients uploaded into IMGC\u2019s system on a continuous basis \nwill indicate early defaulting loans. Settlement of claims with a lender will take place only \nafter  the  lender  has  completed  the  foreclosure  process  and  disposed  of  the  foreclosed \nproperty through public auction. The claims settlement process will be clearly outlined with \nthe  lender  under  the  MGA.  Disputed  cases  will  also  follow  a  procedure  set  forth  in  the \nMGA.  \n \nE. \n\nRisk Management \n\n1. \n\nCredit Risk \n\n43. \nAs  noted,  IMGC  will  develop  guidelines  to  manage  the  credit  risk  of  both  the \nborrower  and  the  lender.  With  respect  to  borrower  risk,  IMGC  will  require  the  lender  to \nundertake  specific  verifications,  such  as  bank  statements  and  evidence  of  employment. \nFor nonsalaried employees where a significant portion of income is received in cash, it is \noften difficult to assess their real income. Self-employed individuals will often not declare \ntheir  real  income  to  avoid  income  taxes.  Thus,  due  diligence  that  includes  a  thorough \nexamination of a borrower\u2019s income, established through accounting records and visits to \nthe  borrower\u2019s  premises,  may  be  required.  Credit  risk  will  also  be  assessed  through \nborrower ratings from India\u2019s credit bureau, the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited \n(CIBIL).  CIBIL  collects  both  positive  and  negative  credit  information.  Historical  data  is \nsomewhat  limited  since  CIBIL  launched  its  consumer  credit  bureau  operations  in  2004; \nhowever,  by  May  2005  CIBIL  had  already  accumulated  20  million  records  from  30 \nmembers.  \n \n44. \nLender  risk  will  be  managed  through  IMGC\u2019s  lender  approval  and  monitoring \nprocesses. Through random quality checks, IMGC will ensure that lenders are adhering to \nthe  underwriting  processes  established  for  borrowers.  Additionally,  IMGC  will  develop  a \ndetailed  lender  evaluation  mechanism  to  assess  lenders  prior  to  signing  an  MGA.  The \nMGA will help to mitigate key risk issues through the compliance of the lender with certain \nunderwriting criteria.  \n\n2. \n\nPortfolio Risk  \n\nPortfolio risk is expected to be managed in a variety of ways. Data management \n45. \nwill be important; significant emphasis will be placed on data capture and analysis. Apart \nfrom  system  validations  of  data,  the  data  used  for  underwriting  will  be  sample  validated \nthrough the lender quality assurance process. Through the portfolio monitoring tasks that \nwill be undertaken on a continuous basis (as previously described), IMGC will be able to \nassess the performance of its portfolio at almost any time. Adverse selection, which would \nnegatively  impact  IMGC\u2019s  overall  portfolio  performance,  would  be  mitigated  by  lender \naudits,  as  well  as  through  the  MGA,  which  will  specifically  prohibit  adverse  selection. \nPortfolio  risk  for  many  mortgage  insurers  or  guarantors  can  also  be  decreased  through \nreinsurance arrangements. At this time, however, the RBI guidelines do not allow for such \nreinsurance. \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nInformation Technology and Management Information System \n\n46. \nInformation technology (IT) systems will be critical for the successful operation of \nIMGC,  which  will  be  working  with  established,  sophisticated  lenders.  Thus,  it  is  very \nimportant that IMGC does not impede their origination processes. The IT system will be a \nweb-based  application  that  will  be  integrated  with  the  lender  partners\u2019  systems  and  also \nhave application interfaces with CIBIL. The system will be designed as a true web-based \napplication  having  three-tier  architecture  with  a  common  logon  server  (web  server),  an \napplication  server  (performing  basic  applications  and  logic),  and  the  database  server \n(storing  historical  data).  The  system  will  be  designed  to  be  scalable  as  the  business \ngrows,  including  taking  a  load  of  20\u2013100  concurrent  users  over  the  first  3  years.  The \nsystem will be designed so lenders can transmit data either on a flow or batch data basis.  \n \n\n47. \nThe mortgage guarantee applications will include a strong rule-based review and \napproval system. It will contain a robust document management system and the ability to \nstore document images. It will interface with a general ledger system and have the ability \nto generate accounting and management reports. \n \n\n48. \nIMGC\u2019s IT system will have the highest level of security and availability in order to \nbuild  the  business.  The  web  application  will  be  built  with  a  highly  redundant  network \nconfiguration  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  single  point  of  failure.  Disaster  recovery  and \nbusiness  continuity  plans  will  be  in  place.  The  system  will  have  three  levels  of  security \n(physical,  operational,  and  system)  to  ensure  that  customer  data  is  protected.  Physical \naccess  will  be  restricted,  and  dedicated  firewalls  will  be  used  to  block  unauthorized \naccess. A managed system will be in place to provide data security.  \n \n\nG. \n\nHead Office and Branch Locations \n\n49. \nIMGC\u2019s corporate head office will be in Delhi, and this will also serve as a regional \noffice.  There  will  be  two  other  regional  offices\u2014Mumbai  and  Bangalore\u2014which  will \ncentralize risk and underwriting operations. As IMGC expands operationally, it is expected \nthat  additional  branch  offices  will  be  established  and  these  will  operate  as  sales  and \nmarketing  outlets.  IMGC\u2019s  proposed  structure  mirrors  the  regional  branch  offices  of  the \nmajor  lenders.  Due  to  the  vast  size  of  the  country,  large  population,  and  the  operational \nmodel of most large banks, an extensive \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d operation is needed to ensure \nsuccess in India.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED EQUITY INVESTMENT \n\n \nA. \n\nADB\u2019s Proposed Investment  \n\n1. \n\nEquity Investment \n\n50. \nADB  proposes  to  make  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  Rs800  million.  ADB\u2019s \nmaximum  commitment  will  not  exceed  19%  of  IMGC\u2019s  share  capital.  The  initial  target \ncapitalization  was  set  based  upon  the  projected  business  volume  and  regulatory  capital \nrequirements.  ADB\u2019s  initial  equity  investment  will  be  Rs96  million  (approximately  $2.23 \nmillion).  Successive  infusions  of  equity  up  to  each  shareholder\u2019s  committed  amount  will \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\noccur as IMGC\u2019s business grows and certain performance targets are met, as determined \nby its board of directors.  \n \n51. \nAn  investment  for  IMGC  was  initially  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in \n2002.22 Board approval was given for up to $10 million representing an equity position of \nup to 25% in IMGC.  IMGC was not established because the regulatory framework for the \nmortgage  guarantee  industry  was  not  introduced  until  February  2008.    New  Board \napproval  is  being  sought  given  that  the  prior  Board  approval  has  lapsed  and  also  in \nconsideration of the higher amount of funding that is now needed and the change in the \ninitial shareholding structure.23  Due diligence was recently undertaken for this project due \nto  changes  in  the  market  and  subsequent  revisions  to  assumptions  for  IMGC\u2019s  financial \nperformance.    \n \nB. \n\nExit Strategy \n\n52. \nADB will consider the disposal of its shares in IMGC once the developmental role \nof  ADB  has  been  fulfilled  and  after  the  expected  holding  period  of  5  years.  Terms  and \nconditions for ADB\u2019s exit strategy are still under negotiation. However, it is anticipated that \nADB may have the right to dispose of its investment through exercise of a put option.  The \nput price is anticipated to be calculated on a fair market value basis.  \n\n \n53. \nAnother exit option for ADB will be through an initial public offering. Should market \nconditions permit, ADB could dispose of its shares via an initial public offering at any time \nduring and after the initial 5-year holding period. ADB may also seek to sell its shares to a \nstrategic investor.  \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nJustification  \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\nThe ADB assistance will promote significant development in India. \n\n54. \n \n55. \nIncrease Access to Housing. Demand for housing in India is strong and growing. \nHowever,  access  to  housing  is  currently  limited  to  certain  segments  of  the  population, \nsuch as mid-to-higher income groups (typically located in urban areas), with an emphasis \non  salaried  employees  of  large  companies  or  well-established  employers.  For  instance, \nthe rate of household formation is particularly high in the self-employed segment; however, \nmortgage  penetration  rates  are  quite  low.  By  providing  mortgage  lenders  with  risk \nprotection in the form of a guarantee, lenders are expected to be encouraged to penetrate \nbroader market segments and offer mortgage loans on terms and conditions that are more \nflexible for borrowers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Equity \n\nInvestment to India for the India Mortgage Guarantee Company. Manila (EI7180- IND). \n\n23  The  Canadian  Housing  Mortgage  Corporation  (CHMC)  withdrew  from  the  transaction  as  both  an  equity \ninvestor  and  technical  services  provider.    CHMC  is  owned  entirely  by  the  Canadian  government.  The \nCanadian  government  has  altered  its  stance  and  has  prohibited  CHMC  from  taking  equity  positions  in \noverseas ventures.   \n\n \n\n\fImprove  Affordability.  Typically,  mortgage  lenders  require  a  minimum  down \n56. \npayment of 20% or more of the value of the house. For nontraditional borrower segments, \nlenders in India have required much larger down payments. Many potential borrowers in \nlower-income  or  self-employed  segments  are  either  denied  loans  or  have  had  to \naggregate  large  down  payments  through  family  contributions  or  expensive  quasi-legal \nfunding sources. IMGC will help to improve the affordability of homes as the lender will be \nable  to  provide  loans  in  higher  amounts,  while  being  protected  from  this  additional  risk \nthrough  a  mortgage  guarantee.  A  higher  loan  amount  will  reduce  the  overall  cost  of \nhousing to a borrower over the life of the loan. Finally, with a guarantee a lender may be \nmore  willing  to  provide  lower  interest  rates  on  mortgage  loans  to  some  of  these \nunderserved borrower segments. \n \n57.  Meet  Need  for  Housing  Stock  in  India.  Housing  is  in  chronic  shortage  in  India \ndue to pressures from population growth and high urbanization rates. As mentioned, the \n11th Five Year Plan Working Committee for the Government noted that in 2007 there was \na  shortage  of  24.71  million  housing  units  in  urban  areas  and  47.43  million  units  in  rural \nareas. By expanding the availability of mortgage financing, the pace and number of home \nconstruction projects is likely to increase.  \n \n58. \nBroaden and Strengthen the Housing Finance Sector. The establishment of a \nmortgage guarantee (or insurance) industry is an important component of housing finance \nsystems in developed markets. Mortgage guarantees and insurance exist not only in the \nUS  but  also  in  Australia,  Canada,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  Hong  Kong,  China. \nMortgage guarantees diminish risk in the banking system through the reduction of credit \nrisk  on  their  portfolio,  thereby  allowing  a  lender  to  penetrate  new  markets  and  deepen \nlending in those markets in which they are already active. Additionally, mortgage lenders \nin  India  are  expected  to  benefit  from  a  reduction  in  capital  risk  weights  under  Basel  II \nthrough  use  of  mortgage  guarantees.  Finally,  market  underwriting  practices  can  be \nstandardized  and  strengthened,  given  that  IMGC  will  require  lenders  to  adhere  to  its \nstandards  with  respect  to  credit  information  and  delinquency  management  systems,  for \ninstance. In the long term this standardization may help to broaden the secondary market \nfor mortgage portfolios, including the securitization market. \n  \n59. \nSupport  Government  Objectives.  IMGC  will  directly  address  Government  and \nregulator objectives. First, it will help to tackle the severe shortage of housing and housing \nfinance in India, which is acknowledged by the Government as one of the most pressing \nissues in India today. Second, recognizing the value to the housing finance sector and the \nultimate  borrower,  the  Government  has  spent  years  studying  and  developing  guidelines \nfor  a  mortgage  guarantee  industry.  Regulators  have  released  final  guidelines  for  the \ncreation of a mortgage guarantee industry and IMGC is expected to be the first mortgage \nguarantee company established in India. Additionally, a mortgage guarantee company will \nbe  in  a  position  to  apprise  regulators  of  high-risk  lender  practices  that  may  have  an \nadverse impact on the mortgage market.  \n \nGenerate  Jobs  and  Additional  Revenue.  Mortgage  lending  is  an  important \n60. \ndevelopment activity.  A  healthy  mortgage  market enables a  country to generate  multiple \nsources  of  employment,  and  employment  related  to  the  construction  and  home \nimprovement  industries  is  supported.  Consumption  of  consumer  goods  also  increases. \nImportantly, mortgage lending also serves as a vehicle to create one of the most important \nsources  of  capital  for  an  individual  or  family.  Capital  for  the  establishment  of  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  can  be  accessed  through  a  mortgaged  property.  By  providing \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nfunding  for  IMGC,  the  proposed  ADB  investment  will  contribute  to  expanding  India\u2019s \neconomic base through supporting employment in the construction and real estate sectors \nin a number of areas throughout the country. In India, the construction sector is one of the \nlargest contributors to GDP. It is estimated that for every Indian rupee invested in housing, \nRs0.78 is added to GDP.24  \n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\nAlthough ADB\u2019s equity investment is small, the value of its participation is, and has \n61. \nbeen, significant. First, ADB has worked with the shareholders and the Government for a \nnumber  of  years  to  establish  a  commercially  viable  mortgage  guarantee  industry,  which \nwill broaden the housing market in India. ADB\u2019s activities have included providing input on \ndraft  regulations  for  the  industry.  ADB  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Government  and \nregulators, as needed, to clarify any issues concerning the regulations. Second, given that \nIMGC  is  likely  to  be  the  first  mortgage  guarantee  company  to  be  established  in  India, \nADB\u2019s presence will improve the visibility and acceptance of IMGC in the market. Finally, \nIMGC will need to obtain a rating of AA for lenders to avail themselves of capital relief as \nper  Basel  II  guidelines.  When  the  company  begins  the  rating  process,  ADB\u2019s  presence \nand its AAA rating is likely to have a positive impact on the overall rating of IMGC. \n  \n\n3. \n\nMeasures for Development Impact \n\n62. \nADB  has  prepared  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  measured  the \nexpected development impact of the investment (Appendix 1), in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for preparing a design and monitoring framework.25 \n \n\n4. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n\ninclude \n\nfor  development \n\nThe  country  operations  business  plan  for  2008\u20132010  (COBP)26  broadly  outlines \n63. \nADB\u2019s  strategy  in  India  and  is  part  of  the  larger  draft  country  partnership  strategy  for \n2008\u20132012 (CPS).27 The COBP and the CPS are aligned with India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan \nfor  2007\u20132011.  Critical  areas \ninfrastructure  and  social, \nagricultural,  and  rural  development.  Generating  employment,  improving  public  service \ndelivery, and balancing protection of the environment with growth is also emphasized. The \nCOBP notes that ADB will continue to support infrastructure development in India through \ntransport,  energy,  and  urban  projects.  ADB  will  also  support  agribusiness  infrastructure \nand rural and urban development, and improved water resources management. ADB will \ncontinue to support nonsovereign investments, particularly in these sectors.  \n \n64. \nIMGC directly addresses the Government\u2019s concern for tackling housing shortages \nas outlined in the 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011, and is within the core ADB targets of \nsupporting urban and rural development projects through access to housing for a broader \nspectrum of people. Additionally, IMGC\u2019s objectives are supported by the Government, as \nconcerted efforts were made by the regulators to develop regulations for this industry.  \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Karnad, Renu S. 2006. Housing Finance Mechanisms in India. Paper for United Nations Human Settlements \n\nProgram, 2006.  Mumbai. \n\n25 ADB. 2006. Guidelines for Preparing a Design and Monitoring Framework.  Manila. \n26 ADB.  2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010):  India.  Manila.   \n27 ADB.  July 2008. Draft Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132012):  India.  Manila.   \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s investment in IMGC expands, and is complementary to, ADB\u2019s ongoing and \n65. \nprospective initiatives in the housing sector in India. These include a nonsovereign loan of \n$20 million equivalent in local currency to the Dewan Housing Finance Limited Corporation \nthat was approved by the ADB Board in December 2003. Dewan Housing Finance Limited \nCorporation  provides  loans  to  the  self-employed  and  the  lower-middle  income  class. \nADB\u2019s  investment  in  IMGC  is  complementary  to  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  help  India  broaden  its \nhousing market. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department is planning to provide technical assistance \nto the Ministry of Housing and Poverty Alleviation to improve urban development, including \nbasic shelter and services. Thus, IMGC will expand the activities of ADB's Private Sector \nOperations  Department  in  the  housing  sector  and  complement  the  public  sector  project \nrelated to low-income housing.  \n  \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\n66. \nAs a financial intermediation investment which is expected to result in insignificant \nenvironmental  impacts,  the  proposed  investment  is  assigned  a  classification  of  C  for \nenvironment  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  investment  has  also \nbeen  assigned  a  category  C  in  respect  of  safeguards  policies  addressing  indigenous \npeople and resettlement issues.  \n \n67.  With respect to the poverty analysis impact, the investment has been assigned a \nclassification  of  general  intervention.  The  investment  will  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction by supporting private sector growth and promoting mortgage financing in India. \nThe social impact of the investment is high, as it will enable banks and HFCs to provide \nmortgage  lending  to  a  broader  spectrum  of  borrowers  in  India.  Moreover,  mortgage \nlending enables a country to generate multiple sources of employment in the construction \nand  real  estate  industries.  A  summary  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is \npresented in Appendix 7. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\nUGC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \n68. \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003), and these \nwill  be  discussed  with  senior  management  of  IMGC  (once  formed).  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require IMGC \nto  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best-practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Further,  IMGC  will  be  required  to \ncovenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and IMGC will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \nD. \n\nTransaction Risks  \n\n69. \nADB  conducted  comprehensive  due  diligence  to  determine  the  viability  of  the \nproposed  equity  investment.  Overall,  the  risks  can  be  regarded  as  acceptable  for  a \ntransaction of this kind. The main risks identified during due diligence, as well as the steps \ntaken to mitigate them, include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nStart-up.  IMGC  may  encounter  risks  generally  associated  with  start-up \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\ncompanies,  including  insufficient  demand  for  its  product,  operational \ninefficiencies, and credit risk. These risks are considered to be reasonable \nand  are  expected  to  be  mitigated,  in  part,  by  the  participation  of  the \nstrategic investor, UGC, which has a strong history in international markets, \nincluding  in  emerging  countries.  IMGC  will  work  closely  with  UGC  risk \nmanagement staff to develop credit risk and operational guidelines. Credit \nrisk  will,  in  part,  be  mitigated  through  application  of  stringent  and \nconservative  underwriting  standards  by  IMGC.  Additionally,  UGC  will \nprovide  IT  systems  and  support,  which  will  be  critical  to  IMGC\u2019s  ability  to \ncapture mortgage data and to interface with lenders.  \n\nWith  respect  to  market  demand,  IMGC  will  benefit  from  the  untapped \nsegments of borrowers in India. IMGC will work closely with each lender to \ntailor its products and services to each lender\u2019s needs in order to increase \nthe attractiveness of the mortgage product. It is anticipated that lenders will \nseek higher yields in underserved markets and will avail themselves of the \nmortgage  guarantee  product  to  reduce  risk.  Moreover,  lenders  are \nexpected  to  consider  the  mortgage  guarantee  product  highly  beneficial \nbecause of the reduction of capital provision under Basel II. Borrowers are \nexpected to be attracted to the mortgage guarantee product because it will \nallow  them  access  to  housing  more  rapidly  and  less  expensively  than  is \ncurrently the case. \n\nMortgage industry performance. A severe downturn in the economy and \nthe  mortgage  market  would  impact  on  the  profitability  of  IMGC.  Although \nrelatively  young,  India\u2019s  mortgage  market  has  performed  well.  The \npercentage  of  NPLs  in  lenders\u2019  portfolios  is  currently  at  about  2.5%. \nMortgage  lenders  are  just  starting  to  expand  into  different  income \nsegments,  other  than  the  upper  and  upper  middle  classes.    Underwriting \npractices,  although  not  uniform,  are  considered  to  be  good  and  have \ntraditionally  been  conservative.  IMGC  will  help  to  improve  underwriting \npractices  through  its  lender  requirements  and  is  expected  to  contribute  to \nthe  establishment  of  industry  underwriting  standards.  Thus,  this  risk  is \nconsidered to be acceptable. \n\nRegulatory  risk.  Regulatory  risk  is  considered  acceptable.  Indian  law \nallows  foreclosure  through  an  extrajudicial  process,  and  a  title  deed \nregistration system exists. Guidelines for the mortgage guarantee industry \nwere  issued  in  February  2008.  While  the  guidelines  are  considered  to  be \nacceptable to industry participants, there is a risk (given that the regulations \nhave  been  tailored  for  a  new  industry  in  India)  that  there  may  be  some \nambiguities  in  the  guidelines.  These  may  need  to  be  clarified  as  IMGC \nbegins  operations.  Regulatory  risk  can  be  mitigated,  in  part,  by  the \npresence of ADB, IFC, and the NHB as shareholders in IMGC.  \n\nPotential conflicts of interest. NHB will initially be the single largest equity \ninvestor in IMGC. It is also the regulator of HFCs, which are expected to be \ncustomers  of  IMGC.  The  NHB  will,  however,  not  regulate  the  mortgage \nguarantee industry, but it could implement new  regulations  with the HFCs \nthat  would  make  the  mortgage  guarantee  product  more  attractive. \nConversely,  NHB  could  increase  the  risk  profile  of  IMGC  through  the \nintroduction  of  regulations  that  would  effectively  encourage  HFCs  to \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n\nadversely select only the most risky mortgage loans. To mitigate potential \nconflicts of interest, UGC will have a significant role in IMGC with the right \nto  appoint  a  managing  director  (subject  to  board  approval).  The  risk  for \nadverse selection will be mitigated through the MGA with the lender, which \nwill  seek  to  exclude  demands  arising  as  a  result  of  adverse  selection. \nCompliance  will  be  confirmed  through  IMGC  random  audits  of  lenders. \nFinally, IMGC\u2019s governance structure will include safeguards to prevent the \nNHB from having any undue influence on the company, and the NHB will be \nrequested to covenant that it will not hold more than 49% of IMGC\u2019s shares. \n\n(v) \n\nMacroeconomic  risk.  The  Indian  economy  has  performed  strongly  since \n2003,  making  it  one  of  the  fastest-growing  global  economies.  Major \nchallenges  include  containing  inflation,  managing  budget  deficits,  and \nfurther appreciation of the rupee, which would be likely to have an adverse \nimpact on exports and corporate profitability in export-oriented sectors. \n\nVI. \n\nEXPOSURE LIMITS \n\n70. \nOnce approved by the Board, the equity investment will represent 0.36% of ADB\u2019s \ntotal  nonsovereign  exposure,  and  increase  ADB\u2019s  exposure  in  the  nonbanking  financial \nsubsector to 3.42%. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign exposure in India following approval of the equity \ninvestment  will  be  $1.12  billion.  The  proposed  equity  investment  is  within  ADB\u2019s \naggregate,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-project  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign \noperations. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\ninto  suitable \n\ninvestment  documentation,  and  ensure \n\nFollowing the approval of the proposed investments by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, \n71. \nADB  will  enter \nthat  such \ndocumentation will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB and consistent with all \nrelevant ADB policies.  \n \n72. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nequity  investment  in  IMGC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n73. \nI am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to Rs800 million to the India Mortgage Guarantee Company from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n01 August 2008 \n  \n\n \n\n\fDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nA broader spectrum of \nborrowers in India will have \naccess to housing on a \nmore affordable basis. \n  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\n \nProvision of guarantees for \napproximately 220,000 \nborrowers during the first 5 \nyears of the India Mortgage \nGuarantee Company\u2019s \n(IMGC) operations   \n \n\n \nIMGC financial reports, \nReserve Bank of India, \nNational Housing Bank of \nIndia \n\nOutcome \nMortgage lenders will be \nmore inclined to move down \nmarket with mortgage \nguarantees that shift some \nrisk of borrower default to \nIMGC. \n \n \n \n \nMortgage lenders will have \nincreased capital for more \nlending activities because \nmortgage guarantees give \ncapital relief under Basel II. \n\nOutputs  \n1.

In  India,  an  asset  is  considered  nonperforming  when  the \nborrower  fails to  pay one or  more installment of  principal and interest  within  90 days of the last \ndate  on  which  that  installment  was  due  to  be  paid  to  the  lender.  Despite  the  rapid  increase  in \nmortgage lending, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are low in India and are at approximately 2.5% of \nlenders\u2019  portfolios.  As  seen  in  Table  A2,  NPLs  for  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs)  are \ncurrently below 2% on average. However, loans offered over the last 3 years account for 71% of \nIndia\u2019s total outstanding portfolio, and have thus not aged. \n \n\nTable A2: Nonperforming Loans for Housing Finance Companies \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nGross NPLs  \n\nFY2001 \n(180 dpd)a\n0.85 \n3.44 \n3.52 \n1.50 \n1.66 \n\nFY2002 \n(180 dpd) \n0.95 \n3.90 \n3.62 \n1.40 \n1.80 \n\nFY2003 \n(180 dpd) \n0.99 \n4.11 \n3.21 \n1.01 \n1.84 \n\nItem  \nHDFC \nLICHF \nCanara Bank \nDHFL \nAverage GNPL \na  Until 2004, loans were considered to be nonperforming after being delinquent for more than 180 days. \nDHFL=  Dewan  Housing  Finance  Corporation,  GNPL  =  gross  nonperforming  loans,  HDFC  =  Housing  Development \nFinance Corporation, LICHF = LIC Housing Finance Corporation, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSources: Annual reports, CRISIL Research. \n\nFY2004 \n(180 dpd) \n0.95 \n3.59 \n2.70 \n1.18 \n1.66 \n\nFY2005 \n(90 dpd) \n1.14 \n4.43 \n2.87 \n1.74 \n2.00 \n\nFY2007 \n(90 dpd) \n0.92 \n2.58 \n1.56 \n1.33 \n1.71 \n\n \n\n \n2. \nLoan  Products.  Mortgage  lenders  offer  loans  on  fixed  and  floating  rate  (adjustable  rate \nmortgage) bases. The interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is linked to the \nbenchmark  prime  lending  rate  of  the  bank  or  the  HFC.  The  rate  changes  depending  on  the \nchanges in the benchmark prime lending rate, and frequency of change varies across lenders (on \naverage  between  3  and  6  months).  With  the  growth  of  commercial  bank  participation  in  the \nmarket,  floating-rate  loans  were  offered  with  regularity  and  became  popular  with  borrowers. \nCommercial banks had access to floating-rate funds from their demand deposits; therefore, they \nwere more likely to offer ARMs to borrowers to reduce asset-liability mismatches. As interest rates \ndeclined in the market, HFCs began to offer ARMs to meet customer demand. According to Credit \nRating  Information  Services  of  India  Limited  (CRISIL),  India\u2019s  leading  rating  agency,  the \npercentage  of  home  loans  that  were  ARMs  was  79%  in  FY2005.  This  percentage  increased  to \n85% in FY2007 and is estimated to increase further to 90% in FY2008. By FY2012, it is projected \nthat the percentage of mortgage loans that are ARMS will decrease to about 86%. \n \n3. \nIn the event of interest rate increases or decreases, the tenor of the loan will be increased \nor decreased to maintain the same payment installment. This option is available for people up to \nthe  age  of  65.  If  the  tenor  cannot  be  increased,  the  installment  is  increased  or  there  can  be  a \ncombination of tenor and installment increases. Given that the average life of a mortgage loan in \nIndia is 8\u201310 years, there is the possibility to provide for such tenor increases.  \n \n4. \nInterest  Rates.  The  average  yield  on  the  benchmark  10-year  Government  security  (risk \nfree return) was about 5.5% in FY2004, and it increased to about 6.2% in FY2005. The average \ninterest  rate  on  a  10-year  mortgage  loan  was  about  7.4%  in  FY2005,  which  represented  a \npremium of 122 basis points (bps) over the risk-free return. Subsequently, most lenders increased \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  2 \n\n23 \n\nthe rate of interest on their housing loan products (both fixed and ARMs) by about 50 bps across \nall tenors in FY2006. Despite the increase in home loan rates, the premium declined sharply to 98 \nbps in FY2006 because of the rise in the yield on 10-year Government security to 7.1%. The yield \non  the  Government  security  was  about  7.5%  in  FY2007  and,  after  a  further  rise  of  50  bps  in \nFY2008, it is expected to decrease. This resulted in an increase in mortgage loan interest rates to \nabout 11%\u201312% in mid-2007.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  3 \n\n24 \n \n\nSUMMARY OF THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nFOR PROPERTY AND MORTGAGES \n \n\n1) \nThe legal system in India provides a framework for transfer of property and recognition of \ntitle. There is a lengthy history in India of private ownership of property and land. Real estate in \nIndia  is  heavily  regulated  with  over  100  laws  that  deal  with  various  aspects  of  the  real  estate \nsector. While the central Government may issue guidelines, states have the option to implement \nsuch guidelines. Some applicable real estate legislation dates back to the 19th century1 and has \noften led to lengthy litigation and created an artificial scarcity of land.   \n \nA. \n\nDeed Registration  \n\nIndia  has  two  types  of  land:  freehold  and  leasehold.  Lease  tenures  and  terms  vary \n2) \nthroughout  the  country.  In  some  locations,  such  as  Mumbai,  the  Government  does  not  sell  its \nland, but rather leases it on a long-term renewable basis for a fee. Lessees are allowed nearly all \nof the rights as a property owner, including the right to mortgage and develop the property.   \n \n3) \nWith  respect  to  titling,  India  has  a  deed  registration  system  whereby  title  is  established \nthrough previous transfers of the property if the transfers can be traced for a consecutive period of \n13  years.  Documents  are  recorded  in  the  land  registry  and  are  the  evidence  of  title,  while \nregistration  of  title  is  a  system  where  the  register  itself  serves  as  the  primary  evidence. \nRegistration  authorities  are  required  to  verify  the  authenticity  of  the  property  and  its  title  while \nregistering  a  document.  Although  authorities  verify  documents,  they  do  not  guarantee  title \nownership. Some states, such as Karnataka, are trying to computerize their registration systems \nto  reduce  inefficiencies.  The  deed  registration  system  in  India  is  not  based  on  a  cadastral \nmapping  system  whereby  a  map  shows  boundaries  and  ownership  of  parcels  of  land.  City \nsurveys  do  exist,  but  they  typically  show  land  and  not  buildings  erected  on  a  site;  therefore, \nencroachments by neighboring owners can occur. Questions regarding titles of property are often \nhandled by placing advertisements in local newspapers for potential claimants to come forward. \nThus,  title  chains  (or  title  due  diligence)  can  be  lengthy  and  typically  involve  a  local  attorney. \nBanks have in-house counsels to conduct title due diligence. \n \nB. \n\nMortgage Registration  \n\n4) \nMortgages are created on property in India by the deposit of the title deeds and payment \nof  fees.  The  registration  process  takes  about  3  weeks.  Transfer  of  property  requires  the \nappropriate conveyance documents to be stamped after payment of duty and registered with the \ngovernment registration offices. Stamp duties are levied on a state level and thus can be as high \nas 15% of the value of the property (in most developed countries this fee is about 1%\u20132% of the \nvalue of the property). The central Government has called for rationalization of stamp duties, but \nstates  have  been  reluctant  to  lower  the  fees  as  they  are  a  substantial  contributor  to  state \nrevenues. Due to the high stamp duties in some states, transaction values are often understated \nto minimize the costs associated with the property sale.   \n \nC. \n\nForeclosure \n\n5. \nThe  Securitisation  and  Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  Enforcement  of  Security \nInterest Act of 2002 allowed secured creditors to pursue foreclosure outside the court system in \n\n                                                 \n1  The primary laws that are still applicable from the 19th and early 20th centuries include the Indian Contracts Act of \n\n1872, the Transfer of Property Act of 1882, and the Registration Act of 1908.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  3 \n\n25 \n\nIndia.  Prior  to  2002,  the  foreclosure  process  could  take  2\u20133  years.  However,  the  relatively  new \nforeclosure process has greatly reduced the time that it takes to conclude foreclosure, and also \ngives  banks  and  housing  finance  companies  added  impetus  to  increase  mortgage  lending.  The \nprocess  is  clear;  remedies  can  be  exercised  after  giving  60  days  notice  to  the  borrower  and \nspecifying  the  assets  in  relation  to  which  the  secured  creditor  proposes  to  take  action.  The \nsecured creditor is required to have considered all objections made by the borrower with respect \nto  why  enforcement  should  not  be  taken  and  if  such  objection  is  not  acceptable,  the  secured \ncreditor is required to communicate the same with reasons. Upon the expiry of the 60 day- notice, \nanother 30-day notice is to be provided to the borrower of sale of the secured assets.  If the loan \nis not paid during this period, the property is auctioned for the best price. According to the law, the \nbank must sell the property and cannot use the asset. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  4 \n\n26 \n \n\nINDIA MORTGAGE GUARANTEE COMPANY INITIAL SHAREHOLDERS  \n\n1. \nThe  primary  shareholders  of  the  India  Mortgage  Guarantee  Company  (IMGC)  are  the \nfollowing: the National Housing Bank of India (NHB), the United Guaranty Corporation (UGC), the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC).  UGC  is  the \nstrategic  shareholder  in  IMGC  based  upon  its  international  experience  as  a  mortgage  insurer. \nDetails of the shareholders are presented below. \n \nA. \n\nNational Housing Bank of India \n\n2. \nThe  NHB  was  established  in  1988  to  act  as  an  institution  with  a  broad  mandate  that \nincludes the mobilization of resources for housing finance companies (HFCs), regulation of HFCs, \nand development of the housing finance sector in India. The NHB is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nthe  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  It  has  provided  financial  assistance  to  18  HFCs  and  about  40 \ncommercial  and  cooperative  banks.  With  respect  to  regulation  of  the  HFCs,  the  NHB  sets \nprudential norms for HFCs based on required capital adequacy ratios, income recognition, asset \nclassification, and acceptable levels of nonperforming assets. The regulatory role of the NHB also \ncovers the deposit acceptance activities of the HFCs. In FY2007, the NHB provided Rs12.1 billion \nof refinancing to HFCs. Its profit after tax was Rs1.14 billion and total assets were Rs215 billion as \nof the same period. The NHB\u2019s capital adequacy ratio was 22.58% as of 30 June 2007. \n \nB. \n\nUnited Guaranty Corporation \n\n3. \nEstablished  in  1963,  UGC  is  a  leading  private  mortgage  guarantee  insurance  company \nheadquartered  in  the  US.  For  the  past  several  years,  UGC  has  also  been  successful  in \ndeveloping  operations  in  international  markets  including  Australia,  Canada,  Israel,  Mexico  and \nHong Kong, China, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American International Group (AIG), a \nleading global insurance and financial services company.  \n \nC. \n\nInternational Finance Corporation  \n\n5. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  a  member  of  the  World  Bank,  was \nestablished in 1956. It maintains a AAA rating. As of the end of June 2007, IFC had total assets of \n$40.6 billion, and shareholder\u2019s equity totaled $14.1 billion. IFC\u2019s net income for FY2007 was $2.6 \nbillion as compared to $1.2 billion for FY2006. It has experience in the housing finance sector with \na global portfolio of approximately $2 billion. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  5 \n\n27 \n\n \nPROPOSED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE INDIA MORTGAGE GUARANTEE \nCOMPANY  \n \n \n \n\nManaging Director\n\nExecutive Assistant\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nChief Risk Officer\n\nVice President-Finance\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nCompany Secretary and Legal\n\nHuman Resources\n\nAccounts and Finance\n\nProduct and Pricing\n\nCredit Policy and \nPortfolio Analytics\n\nInformation and Technology\n\nUnderwriting\n\nInvestments\n\nMarketing and Liaison\n\nFacility Management Services\n\nClaims and Recovery\n\nService Delivery, \nOperations and Compliance\n\nProject Management \nOffice\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  6 \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n \nEXAMPLE OF COST SAVINGS TO A LENDER USING A MORTGAGE GUARANTEE \n\nLenders  will  benefit  from  a  mortgage  guarantee  due  to  the  reduction  of  credit  risk  on \n1. \ntheir portfolio. The lower risk enables them to reduce the provisions for losses on their portfolio. \nLenders will also benefit substantially from the reduction in capital risk weights under Basel ll if \na mortgage guarantee is provided by a company that is rated AA or higher.1  Savings on costs \nassociated  with  capital  and  provisions  requirements  can  then  be  deployed  to  originate  new \nmortgage loans.   \n\n2. \nTable A8 illustrates the cost savings to a housing finance company (HFC) that uses a \nmortgage  guarantee.  The  example  uses  a  $100,000  mortgage  loan  with  a  tenor  of  12  years. \nThe mortgage guarantee provides coverage against default for 20% of the value of the sample \nloan.   \n\n3. \nWith  respect  to  capital  relief,  HFCs  are  required  to  hold  capital  of  12%  of  the  loan \namount risk weighted at 50%. Therefore, the effective capital to risk weighted asset ratio is 6%. \nIf the risk weight is reduced to 20% due to the mortgage guarantee, the capital to risk weighted \nasset ratio is reduced to 1.2% on the covered portion of the loan. The average capital required \non  a  loan  without  a  mortgage  guarantee  is  about  $3,554  per  year.  With  the  mortgage \nguarantee,  the  average  capital  required  is  approximately  $2,985.  The  reduction  in  capital  of \nabout $569 each year yields a savings of $682 over the life of the loan.   \n\n4. \nIf  a  lender  were  to  use  a  mortgage  guarantee,  the  provisioning  requirements  for  the \ncovered  portion  of  the  loan  would  also  be  reduced.  In  the  example  in  Table  A8,  the  average \nprovision  held  each  year  would  be  approximately  $444  (0.75%  of  the  average  outstanding \nbalance). With an assumed mortgage guarantee providing coverage for 20% of the loan, cost \nsavings over the life of the loan are estimated at about $107.     \n\n5. \nFinally, if the loan were to default, IMGC would assume 20% of the loss at 6% of the \ntotal  value  of  the  loan,  which  is  the  projected  industry  standard.  The  savings  in  a  default \nscenario  total  $1,200.  The  total  savings  to  the  HFC,  including  capital  relief,  provisioning,  and \ndefaults, for the sample $100,000 mortgage loan with a mortgage guarantee is approximately \n$1,989. If the loan has a high loan-to-value ratio with a higher capital requirement, the financial \nincentive to use a mortgage guarantee would be even greater. \n\n \n                                                \n1 The Government has stated that Basel II guidelines will be introduced this year for banks. NHB has yet to come out \nwith similar guidelines for HFCs, however, it has indicated that it will be releasing similar guidelines concurrent with \nthe implementation of Basel II.   \n\n \n\n\fTable A6: Example of Cost Savings to a Housing Finance Company \n\n \n\nItem \n\nCapital Relief \n\nAppendix  6 \n\n29 \n\n Cost Savings\n\nCurrent capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (CRAR) \nCRAR with guarantee (assuming Basel II applies) \n\n \nAverage capital required annually without mortgage guaranteea\nAverage capital required annually with mortgage guaranteeb\nAverage savings annually by using mortgage guarantee   \nYield on capitalc  \nCapital cost savings over 12 years   (A)                              \n \nSavings on Provisions \nProvisions held at mortgage origination without mortgage guaranteed\nProvisions held at mortgage origination with mortgage guaranteee\nSavings on provisions over 12 yearsf   (B) \n \nSavings for HFC in Default Scenario \nUltimate claim rateg  \nMortgage guarantee coverage                                                                     \nProbable claim on loan  (C)                                     \n \n\n6%\n1.20%\n\n$3,554 \n\n$2,985 \n$569 \n10%\n$682 \n\n$444 \n\n$355\n\n$107 \n\n6%\n20%\n$1,200.00 \n\n$1,989 \n\nTotal benefit (A) + (B) + (C) or about 2% on the $100,000 loan                            \na The average annual outstanding balance of the sample loan is $59,227.  To determine the average capital required annually, \n$59,227 is multiplied by 12% (which represents the capital to be held) multiplied by 50% (which is the current risk weighting).   \n \nb The average capital required for the sample loan when a mortgage guarantee is used is calculated by taking the $3,554 (the \ncapital required without a guarantee) multiplied by 0.80 (to represent the uncovered portion of the loan) plus $3,554 multiplied by \n0.20 (representing the guaranteed portion of the loan) multiplied by 0.20, which represents the reduction in the CRAR.    \n \nc An assumed yield is provided and applied to the difference between the two sample capital requirements and then multiplied by \nthe tenor of the mortgage loan (12 years) to give the cost savings presented in (A). \n \nd The provisions held at mortgage origination are calculated as per regulatory norms at 0.75% of the average outstanding loan \nbalance of $59,227. \n \ne Provisions at origination with a mortgage guarantee are calculated as per regulatory norms at 0.75% of the average outstanding \nloan balance of $59,227 multiplied by 0.80 (to represent the uncovered portion of the loan).  The covered portion of the loan \n(20%) would not require provisioning. \n \nf This savings on provisions over the life of the loan is calculated by using the amount of provisions on the loan at origination \ntotaling $444 multiplied by 0.20, which represents the portion that would be guaranteed, multiplied by the assumed yield of 10% \nover a 12-year period.   \n \n\ng The claims rate is based upon projected industry performance. \n                                                      \nsian Development Bank estimates. \nSource:  A\n\n \n\n\fAppendix  7 \n\n30 \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: India/India Mortgage Guarantee Company \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nEquity Investment \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nPrivate Sector Operations Department/ \nInfrastructure Finance Division 2 \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe  project  would  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  how  it  is  linked  to  the  poverty  reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  meet  a  substantial  need  for  housing.  There  is  a  shortage  of \nhousing in India, particularly for lower-middle income and lower-income classes. Housing conditions in urban areas are \nproblematic.  The  project  will  increase  access  to  affordable  and  long-term  individual  housing  loans  by  providing \nguarantees to banks making such loans.   \n \nThe country operations business plan for 2008\u20132010 (COBP)30 broadly outlines the strategy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in India and is part of the larger draft country partnership strategy for 2008\u20132012 (CPS).31 The COBP and \nthe CPS are aligned with India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011. Critical areas for development include infrastructure \nand  social,  agricultural,  and  rural  development.  Generating  employment,  improving  public  service  delivery,  and \nbalancing  protection  of  the  environment  with  economic  growth  is  also  emphasized.  The  COBP  notes  that  ADB  will \ncontinue to  support infrastructure development in India through transport,  energy,  and urban  projects.  ADB will also \nsupport  agribusiness  infrastructure,  rural  and  urban  development,  and  improved  water  resources  management.  ADB \nwill continue to support nonsovereign investments, particularly in these sectors.   \n \nThe  proposed  project  directly  addresses  the  Government\u2019s  concern  for  addressing  housing  shortages  as  outlined  in \nthe 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011 and is within the core ADB targets of supporting urban and rural development \nprojects  through  access  to  housing  for  a  broader  spectrum  of  people.  Additionally,  the  project  is  supported  by  the \nGovernment, as concerted efforts were made by the regulators to develop regulations for this industry. \n \nB. \n1.  Key Issues  \nWhile India\u2019s poverty rate has decreased from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005, the pace of reduction is less than 1% \nper  annum.a  In  absolute  terms,  nearly  302  million  people  remain  below  the  poverty  line.  The  project  will  indirectly \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  private  sector  growth  and  promoting  mortgage  financing  and \naccessibility  to  housing  in  India.  ADB\u2019s  support  of  this  project  will  not  only  advance  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure \nupgrading efforts but also lessen future public debt burden. By reducing the strain on the Government, more resources \ncan be allocated for poverty reduction purposes.  \n \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n2.  Design Features.  \nThe  proceeds  of  the  equity  investment  will  be  used  to  establish  the  India  Mortgage  Guarantee  Company,  which  will \nprovide guarantees for mortgage lenders who will then be able to expand their lending to a wider population base. The \nprimary objective of the project is to meet the demand for individual housing loans throughout India.    \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  Not applicable. \nII. \nA. \n \nKey  Issues.  Mortgage  lending  is  a  highly  developmental  activity.  A  healthy  mortgage  market  enables  a  country  to \ngenerate multiple sources of employment. Employment related to the construction and home improvement industries is \nsupported.  Importantly,  mortgage  lending  also  serves  as  a  vehicle  to  create  one  of  the  most  important  sources  of \ncapital  for  an  individual  or  family which  can  be  used  to  establish  new businesses.
