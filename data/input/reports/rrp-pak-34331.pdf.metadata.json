Without canal irrigation, agricultural production is \nprecarious  and  poverty  is  pervasive.  The  Project  will  improve \ninputs  and  markets;  enhance  water  storage, \naccess \nconservation,  and  conveyance;  and  diversify  the  sources  of \nincome, while at the same time overcoming fundamental barriers \nto  economic  development  such  as \nilliteracy.  The  project \ncomponents include (i) provision of beneficiary-identified medium-\nscale  infrastructure  to  unions  based  in  barani  areas  (village  and \nunion  development  component,  or  VUDC);  (ii) targeted  poverty \nalleviation \nliteracy \nthrough  skills  training;  and  (iv) institutional  and  implementation \nsupport.  The  Project  is  designed  to  be  demand  driven  by  the \nintended beneficiaries in both design and implementation. \n \nBarani  areas  are,  almost  by  definition,  areas  with  high  levels  of \npoverty.  The  primary  problem  facing  barani  areas  is  a  lack  of \naccess to water for crop and  livestock production and thus lower \nand  uncertain  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity.  However, \nmany  other  factors  also  add  to  the  high  levels  of  poverty.  These \ninclude  impeded  access  to  markets,  inputs,  and  services  due  to \ninadequate  or  nonexistent  transportation  infrastructure;  a  lack  of \naccess \nthe \nto  electricity,  with  negative  consequences \nproductive  potential  of  both  agriculture  and  off-farm  sectors; \nhealth  and  productivity  constraints  arising  from  limited  access  to \ndomestic drinking water; a limited range of alternative, high-value \ncrops  or  crop  varieties  specially  adapted  to  barani  areas; \ninadequate and poorly managed rangelands for livestock; serious \nloss  of  productive  land  due  to  water  and  wind  erosion;  poor \naccess to agriculture and livestock advisory and support services; \nand \nto  new \nlow \nincome-earning \nthe  adoption  of  alternative \ntechnologies  or \nactivities. Development activities in barani areas have been shown \nto be successful in tackling these problems when there have been \n\nthrough  community  groups;  (iii) enhanced \n\nimpede  access \n\nliteracy,  which \n\nlevels  of \n\nfor \n\n\fin \n\ninputs, \n\ninvolvement \n\nlevels  of  beneficiary \n\nthe  design  and \nhigh \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  As  a  result  of  the  Punjab \nLocal  Government  Ordinance  of  2001,  official \ninstitutional \nstructures  now  exist  at  grassroots  level  in  rural  areas  to  allow \nelected  representation  and  local  management  of  development \nactivities.  In  these  conditions  it  is  now  possible  to  combine  past \nexperience  and  lessons  learned  in  barani  areas  with  the  new, \nrepresentative institutional structures in rural areas (union councils \nand zila councils) to implement a poverty-focused project that will \nreinforce the ongoing decentralization process and have a strong \ndevelopment impact on the ground. This will be achieved through \nthe  support  of  activities,  selected  and  managed  by \nthe \nbeneficiaries  themselves,  that  enhance  productivity  of  resources, \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  for  the  areas\u2019  population,  and  improve \naccess to markets through better rural infrastructure.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  enhance  access  to  land,  water, \nmarkets,  services,  agricultural \ntechnologies,  and \nemployment  among  the  population  living  in  barani areas  in  order \nto  increase  incomes,  improve  the  quality  of  life  and,  ultimately, \nreduce  poverty  among  vulnerable  groups  within  the  project  area. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  Project  will  strengthen  governance \nstructures, aid the process of devolution, and build capacity within \nlocal  governments  to  plan  and  implement  development  activities. \nThe  Project  will  cover  those  districts  and  parts  of  districts  in \nPunjab province that have much  barani land but that have yet to \nbe covered by a barani or area development project. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $58.6 million  equivalent \ncomprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $12.0 million,  and  local \ncurrency cost of $46.6 million equivalent. \n \nThe  proposed  financing  plan  is  shown  in  the  following  table.  It  is \nproposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  finance  the \nforeign exchange cost of $12.0 million as well as a portion of the \nlocal  currency  cost  ($29.0 million)  to  reach  a  total  financing \namount  of  $41.0 million.  The  balance  of  the  local  cost  will  be \ncovered  partly  by  beneficiary  contributions  to  the  VUDC  and \ntargeted  poverty  alleviation  activities,  and  partly  by \nthe \nGovernment  through  the  payment  of  duties  and  taxes  and  the \nincremental operational costs of district-level line agencies. \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n12.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n12.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n29.0 \n8.8 \n8.8 \n46.6 \n\nTotal Cost \n \n\n41.0 \n8.8 \n8.8 \n58.6 \n\n% \n\n70 \n15 \n15 \n100 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  proposed  ADB \n\n \n\nfinancing \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources is equivalent in various currencies to SDR 27,207,000. \nThe loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years  with  an  interest  charge of  1%  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% thereafter. \n \n1 January 2005 to 30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\nfor \n\nthe  VUDC  will  be \n\n \nAgency for Barani Area Development (ABAD) \n \nABAD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management  and \nmonitoring.

A  project  steering  committee  will  undertake \nbroad  oversight  of  the  Project  and  its  implementation.

The  Project  will  require  support  from \n399 person-months of consulting services, comprising 42 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  357  months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  In  addition,  ABAD  will  recruit  the \nservices of rural support programs, nongovernment organizations, \nor local consulting companies for the village and union organizers \nwho  will  work  directly  in  the  field  with  the  union  administrations, \nvillages, and district agencies to provide on-the-ground support to \nthe  VUDC.  About  1,080  person-months  of  village  and  union \norganizers input will be required.  \n \nThe Project will enhance the livelihood and quality of life of about \n350,000 households living in the rural areas of 200 of the poorest \nunions in Punjab that are dependent primarily on precarious rain-\nfed agriculture as their main source of income. In addition, poorer \ngroups  in  the  project  area  (about  70,000  households)  will  be \nspecially \nincome-\nenhancing activities.  \n \nSuccessful  implementation  rests  upon  several  key  assumptions \nand  the  mitigation  of  several  risks.  The  design  assumes  that  the \ncommunity  mobilization  can  be  carried  out  effectively  to  ensure \npoverty  targeting  and  a  participatory  approach.  It  also  assumes \nthat  environmental,  social,  and  gender  concerns  can  be \nsafeguarded  in  implementation.  In  terms  of  sustainability,  it  also \nassumes \nthe  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  established  facilities  will  be  ensured.  The \nmajor  risks  for  the  Project  include:  (i) lack  of  capacity  in  district \nline agencies, and (ii) lack of accountability and political patronage \nat the district-level institutions.  \n \nFor community mobilization, the Project has included established \nrural  support  programs  operating  in  the  project  districts.  These \nlocation-specific,  gender-  and \ninstitutions  already  have \nenvironment-sensitive \nand \nmonitoring systems\u2014all of which can be tapped in support of the \nProject.  For  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  international \nconsultants for each of these disciplines will be engaged early to \nestablish  a  framework  for  screening  subprojects.  Concerns  over \nO&M  will  be  partly  addressed  by  the  requirement  for  upfront \nbeneficiary  contributions,  which \nin  project \nsustainability. For the larger medium-scale infrastructure, such as \nroads or rural electrification, there will be established line agency \nprocedures  and  responsibilities.  Also,  under  the  Medium  Term \nBudgetary  Framework  (2004/05\u20132007/08),  O&M  benchmarks  are \nbeing  upgraded,  and  an  increasing,  dedicated  budget  is  being \nallocated to district O&M expenditure. \n \n\nthat,  with  project  support, \n\nprocedures, \n\nprograms, \n\ninvests \n\nthem \n\nstaff, \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nfor \n\nTo  offset  the  risk  of  limited  capacity  in  line  agencies,  the  Project \nprovides  for  a  specific  budget  for  line  agency  support  in \nimplementation,  and \ntraining, \nfor  consultants \nguidance,  and  support.

While 26.1% of the country\u2019s \npopulation was classified as poor in 1990/91, the proportion had grown to 32.1% by 2000/01. In \nabsolute  terms,  the  number  of  poor  more  than  doubled  to  47 million  during  the  1990s. \nMoreover,  Pakistan  ranks  poorly  in  several  major  social  indicators:  infant  mortality  is  90  per \n1,000 live births, malnutrition of children under 5 is 39%, adult literacy is 45% overall (and 31% \namong women),1 and 45% of the population have no access to health services. Pakistan ranks \namong  the  lower  quarter  of  the  human  development  index, with  a  ranking  of  142  among  177 \ncountries, which is lower than other countries in South Asia. \n \n3. \nPoverty  in  Pakistan  is  very  much  a  rural  phenomenon  linked  closely  to  the  economic \nhealth of the agriculture sector. About 35 million or 75% of the estimated 47 million poor live in \nrural areas. This is especially true in Punjab province where 36.3 % of the rural population live \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  The  proposed  project  districts  include  the  four  poorest  districts  in  the \nprovince. About 47% of the rural population in these districts are estimated to be poor.2 These \nhigh  levels  of  poverty  in  rural  areas  tie  in  closely  with  particularly  low  growth  rates  in  the \nagriculture sector over the past decade. Growth in agricultural gross domestic product has been \nbelow  5%  for  most  of  the  1990s  and,  due  to  a  prolonged  and  serious  drought,  contracted  in \n2001  and  2002.  As  might  be  expected,  unirrigated,  or  barani3  areas  suffered  much  more \nseverely as a result of the drought than the canal-irrigated areas. Poor yields or complete crop \nfailures forced many farmers into debt and to abandon their lands during this period. Details on \nrecent developments in the agriculture sector and the barani subsector are given in Appendix 1. \n \nIn addition to its direct relationship with the viability of the agriculture sector, rural poverty \n4. \nis  also  linked  to  other  factors.  Indeed,  poor  governance  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the \nprimary causes of continued poverty in the country and especially in rural areas.4 In response to \nthe  need  for  improved  governance  in  rural  areas,  the  Government  has  recently  taken  major \nsteps to restructure its lower institutional levels. These have comprised a devolution of powers \nand  responsibilities  to  the  district,  tehsil  (subdistrict),  and  union  (sub-subdistrict)  levels,  most \nnotably the passage of the Punjab Local Government Ordinance of 2001 setting up elected local \ncouncils. Elections of representatives to district, tehsil, and union have since taken place. This \nhas been a dramatic development, since with seats reserved for women, small farmers, and the \npoor,  a  disadvantaged  portion  of  the  population  has  been  given  grassroots  representation  for \n\n                                                 \n1    Equivalent figures for rural areas in Punjab province are 35% and 21%, respectively. \n2   Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n3   The term barani as used in this report refers to areas outside of the command of the extensive irrigation systems \n\nupon which most of Pakistan\u2019s agricultural productivity is based. \n\n4   ADB. 2002. Poverty in Pakistan: Issues, Causes and Institutional Response. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nthe first time. This move toward the decentralization and devolution of powers has been strongly \nsupported by ADB through the Decentralization Support Program, approved in October 2002.5 \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAround  70%  of  the  cultivated  area  in  Punjab  province  is  within  a  major  irrigated \ncommand,  allowing  farmers  reasonably  assured  access  to  water  and,  as  a  result,  both \nguaranteed and relatively high crop yields. On the remaining 30% of the cultivated area, rain-fed \nor  barani  crop  production  is  undertaken  without  irrigation  or  with  only  sparse  irrigation  from \nlocal,  often  makeshift,  sources.  In  a  predominantly  arid  country  like  Pakistan  this  means  that \nfarming in these areas is especially prone to drought and consequent crop losses and failures. \nDespite  drought  mitigation  measures  and  coping  strategies,  barani  farming  is  thus  both  a  low \nproductivity and high risk venture. Yields on barani lands are typically, on average, only 30\u201350% \nof those on irrigated lands. As a consequence, farm incomes are uncertain and insecure, and \npoverty levels are high. Within rural areas of the country, then, the barani areas are even more \nsusceptible to high incidences of poverty than other rural areas. \n \n6. \nFocusing  development  activities  on  the  barani  areas  is  thus  one  way  of  capturing  a \nparticularly poor and disadvantaged segment of the population. It was with this in view that the \n2002  ADB  country  programming  mission  confirmed  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  request  for \ntechnical assistance to prepare a barani area development project in Punjab province. A project \nof  this  nature  was  considered  fully  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  vision  and  development \ngoals  articulated  in  the  Ten-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  (2001/02\u20132010/11)  and  its \npoverty alleviation strategy. It was also consistent with the emphasis of the ADB 2002 country \nstrategy, which emphasized poverty alleviation through rural economic growth. \n \n7. \nThe  primary  problem  facing  barani  areas  is  a  lack  of  access  to  water  for  crop  and \nlivestock  production  and  thus  lower  and  uncertain  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity. \nHowever,  many  other  factors  also  add  to  the  high  levels  of  poverty  in  these  areas.  These \ninclude  impeded  access  to  markets,  inputs,  and  services  due  to  inadequate  or  nonexistent \ntransportation infrastructure; a lack of access to electricity, with negative consequences for the \nproductive potential of both agriculture and off-farm sectors; health and productivity constraints \narising from limited access to domestic drinking water; a limited range of alternative, high value \ncrops  or  crop  varieties  specially  adapted  to  barani  areas;  inadequate  and  poorly  managed \nrangelands  for  livestock;  serious  loss  of  productive  land  due  to  water  and  wind  erosion;  poor \naccess  to  agriculture  and  livestock  advisory  and  support  services;  and  low  levels  of  literacy, \nwhich impede access to new technologies or the adoption of alternative income-earning activities. \n \n8. \nIn the past, several projects aimed wholly or partly at improvement of barani areas have \nbeen  undertaken  with  financing  from  ADB  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  financing \ninstitutions (Appendix 2). These include the First and Second Punjab Barani Area Development \nprojects,6  the  First7  and  Second8  Northwest  Frontier  Province  Barani  Area  Development \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2002.

Consequently, millions of people in barani \nareas living both below and just above the poverty line have little access to measures to help \nimprove their livelihoods. Expanding known technologies and development techniques to these \nareas and supplementing them with innovative measures will help reduce poverty, in a focused \nand targeted manner, among one of the most disadvantaged groups in the country. Consistent \nwith  its  rural  and  agricultural  priorities,  the government  of  Punjab  places  a  high  priority  on  the \ndevelopment of the barani areas. Recently a ministerial committee has been constituted by the \nChief  Minister  of  Punjab  to  supervise  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  package  for  the \ndevelopment  of  high  impact  interventions  suited  to  the  widely  variable  agro-ecology  of  the \nbarani  areas.  Government\u2019s  articulation  of  the  future  vision  and  strategy  is  reflected  in  the \nPunjab Economic Report.11  \n \n10.  Measures  that  can  be  used  to  enhance  livelihoods  in  rural  areas  include  those  (i) that \nare  aimed  directly  at  lifting  productivity,  (ii) that  are  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  life  and \nthus  indirectly  enhancing  livelihoods,  and  (iii) that  directly  impact  on  both  productivity  and  the \nquality  of  life.  Productivity  in  barani  areas  can  be  lifted  by  (i) improving  crop  yields  through \nimproved  varieties,  farming  techniques,  and  water  management;  (ii) enhancing  productivity  in \nnoncrop  agriculture,  principally  livestock  production,  through  improved  animal  nutrition  and \nhealth and improved range management; and (iii) enhancing nonfarm incomes through training \nin  skills  development  and  access  to  financial  services,  small-scale  industries,  handicrafts,  and \nprovision  of  services.  The  quality  of  life  can  be  improved  through  provision  of  safe  and \naccessible drinking water, provision of access to health facilities, and provision or improvement \nof access to education.12 These measures can, in turn, ultimately lead to enhanced productivity \nthrough the reduction of time spent in fetching water (which can account for more than 4 hours a \nday), reduction in time and work-power lost to illness and disease, and an improvement in the \nability to adopt new earnings techniques and skills through literacy and numeracy. Finally, one \nof the primary measures to be taken to both enhance productivity and improve the quality of life \nis  provision  of  rural  infrastructure,  especially  rural  roads.  These  can  open  up  new  access  to \nmarkets  for  produce  of  the  barani  areas,  reduce  transportation  costs  for  outputs  and  inputs, \nprovide  better  access  to  services,  and  reduce  travel  time  and  expenditures  for  the  areas\u2019 \npopulation. A further critical measure that can enhance both the quality of life and productivity is \nrural electrification. This provides both a source of power for productive activities, such as water \npumping  and  small-scale  industries,  as  well  as  improved  access  to  the  outside  world  through \nbetter education and communications. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n\n11  Pakistan:  Punjab  Economic  Report-Towards  a  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  (Government  of  Punjab, \n\n12  Approximately 50% of the population over 5 years of age in the barani areas of the proposed project districts have \n\nOctober 2004). \n\nnever been to a school of any kind. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nHowever,  simply  replicating  past  efforts  at  rural  development  in  barani  areas  is \n11. \ninsufficient. Most of these measures, with the exception of rural electrification, have been used \nduring  past  barani  and  rural  development  projects  with  mixed  results.  In  terms  of  project \ncompletion  reports,  the  Second  Punjab  Barani  Area  Development  Project,  for  example,  was \nassessed as only being partly successful, whereas the North-West Frontier Province Barani Area \nDevelopment  Project  was  assessed  as  being  successful  overall,  although  some  components \nwere  not  entirely  implemented  as  planned.  Moreover,  measures  that  proved  successful  under \none  project  seemed  to  have  been  unsuccessful  under  the  other.  For  example,  village  water \nsupply  under  the  Second  Punjab  Barani  Area  Development  Project  was  considered  successful \nand  sustainable  while  under  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  Barani  Area  Development \nProject, this component was considered unsuccessful. One of the lessons learned from all such \nprojects and emphasized in project completion reports and project performance audit reports is \nthat for a project in rural areas to be successfully implemented and subsequently successfully \nsustained, beneficiaries should be fully involved in the identification, design, and implementation \nof project activities. Another key lesson learned in past and ongoing projects in barani areas is \nthat,  while  there  are  many  technical  interventions  that  can  be  used  to  reduce  poverty  and \nenhance the quality of life in barani areas, the key to success is to align these to the local needs \nof  the  resource-poor  beneficiaries.  To  a  large  extent,  this  means  that  the  beneficiaries  should \nhave  a  major  role  in  both  selecting  and  implementing  project-financed  interventions  that  they \nthemselves  see  as  affordable  and  important  in  improving  their  livelihood.  Therefore,  effective \nlinks between the line agencies and community social mobilizers are critical for translating the \nneeds of the resource-poor communities into viable and affordable interventions.  \n \n12. \nIn  this  context,  the  decentralization  reforms  currently  being  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment  present  a  unique  opportunity.  As  a  result  of  the  Punjab  Local  Government \nOrdinance of 2001, official institutional structures now exist at grassroots level in rural areas to \nallow  elected  representation  and  local  management  of  development  activities.  In  these \nconditions, it is now possible to combine past experience and lessons learned in  barani areas \nwith  the  new,  representative,  institutional  structures  in  rural  areas  (district,  tehsil,  union,  and \nvillage  councils)  to  implement  a  poverty-focused  project  that  will  reinforce  the  ongoing \ndecentralization  process  and  have  a  strong  development  impact  on  the  ground.  Moreover, \nbarani  areas  are,  almost  by  definition,  areas  of  high  levels  of  poverty.  It  will  thus  now  be \npossible  to  target  areas  with  high  levels  of  poverty  through  a  beneficiary-driven  process.  The \nproposed project has thus been designed to work through the new local government institutions \nand use the lessons and techniques learned from past barani and rural development projects to \nmake  a  strong  positive  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  barani  areas  not  yet  covered  by  existing \nbarani  or  rural  development  projects.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  support  of  activities, \nselected and managed by the beneficiaries themselves, that enhance productivity of resources, \nimprove the quality of life for the areas\u2019 population, improve access of the global population to \nmarkets  through  better  rural  infrastructure,  and  enhance  access  to  opportunities  in  skills \nimprovement and enterprise development. \n \n13. \nPublic investment in barani areas is justified because there are large public externalities \nassociated  with  improved  access,  with  community-level  land  and  water  development,  with \nhealth  and  education,  as  well  as  with  organizing  intended  beneficiaries  and  groups  of  the \nvulnerable  poor  for  participation  in  livelihood-enhancing  activities.  Reliance  on  private  sector \nfunding  alone  would  result  in  underinvestment.  Further,  the  ability  to  mobilize  funds  for  initial \ninvestments is an issue as a large portion of the barani population lives in abject poverty. They \nhave insufficient means or credit standing to secure economically viable investments and barely \nenough for their day-to-day subsistence needs. ADB lending is justified due to (i) insufficiency of \nnational government funds to effectively cover the capital needs for all areas and sectors of the \n\n4\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nimproved \nleverage  poverty-oriented \neconomy,  (ii) ADB's  ability \ngovernance and enhanced participation by the rural poor, and (iii) the opportunity to strengthen \nand reinforce the recently promulgated government devolution. \n \n \n\ninvestment \n\nthrough \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives,  as  reflected  in  the  Project  Framework  in  Appendix 3,  are  to \n14. \nenhance  access  to  land,  water,  markets,  services,  agricultural  inputs,  technologies,  and \nemployment for the population of barani areas in order to increase incomes, improve the quality \nof  life  and, ultimately,  reduce  poverty  among  vulnerable  groups  within  the  project area.  At  the \nsame, the Project will strengthen governance structures, aid the process of devolution, and build \nthe capacity within local governments to plan and implement development activities. The Project \nwill cover those districts and parts of districts in Punjab province that have a substantial area of \nbarani land, but that have yet to be covered by a barani or area development project. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nBased on past experience, two general types of intervention are envisaged: (i) medium-\nscale  interventions  such  as  the  provision  of  rural  access  roads,  electricity,  water  storage  or \nconveyance  structures,  range  improvement,  social  forestry,  and  the  provision  of  social \ninfrastructure; and (ii) fairly small-scale but intensive activities that can be undertaken by small \ncommunity  groups,  such  as  livestock  health  improvement,  the  promotion  of  improved \nagricultural  practices,  the  provision  of  dugwells,  on-farm  water  management  and  conservation \nactivities, and training programs in literacy or nonfarm livelihood activities.  \n \n16. \nIn  the  current  circumstances  in  Punjab  province,  it  is  most  appropriate  for  the  former \ntype of investment to be identified at the village and union levels and implemented by the district \ngovernments, and for the latter type to be identified and implemented within communities with \nthe  assistance  of  a  qualified  and  experienced  rural  support  program  (RSP).13  The  proposed \nProject will thus consist of two main components: the village and union development component \n(VUDC) designed to identify and implement demand driven medium-scale interventions, and the \ntargeted poverty alleviation component designed to scale up ongoing poverty-targeted activities \ncurrently being undertaken by the RSPs to a greater or lesser degree within barani communities \nof  the  project  area.  These  two  components  will  be  supplemented  by  the  following:  Literacy \nthrough Skills Training; and Institutional and Implementation Support.   \n \n17. \nThe project area will be the barani areas of the 10 districts of Bhakkar, Chakwal, Gujrat, \nJhelum, Khushab, Layyah, Mianwali, Narowal, Rawalpindi, and Sialkot, and that have yet to be \ntaken up by a barani or area development project. The barani areas of these districts include a \n\n                                                 \n13  The  success  of  the  Aga  Khan  Rural  Support  Program  as  the  first  large-scale  (regional)  experiment  of  social \norganization  in  the  rural  communities  of  northern  Pakistan  gave  impetus  to  the  growth  of  larger  (regional  and \nnational) rural support programs, primarily supported through endowments received from the Government. RSPs \nare currently operating in all four provinces, the Northern Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and aim to reduce \npoverty and improve the quality of life of the rural poor by harnessing their potential to help themselves. Common \nareas  of  support  given  by  RSPs  to  communities  include:  technical  and  financial  support  for  building  village \nphysical  infrastructure,  provision  of  microcredit,  support  in  the  natural  resource  sectors,  small  enterprise \ndevelopment, and support to poor communities in the social sectors. \n\n \n\n\f \n\npopulation  of  about  3.2 million  living  in  about  2,500  villages  organized  into  200  unions.  The \nproject components will be as follows. \n\n \n1. \n\nVillage and Union Development Component \n\n \n18. \nThe  VUDC  is  designed  to  provide  financing  for  medium-scale  infrastructure  and  other \ninterventions  that  will  help  to  stimulate  livelihood  improvement  in  the  barani  areas.  These  will \nnormally  consist  of  medium-scale  rural  infrastructure  investments,  such  as  upgraded  feeder \nroads,  markets  and  market  improvements,  power  line  connections,  water  conveyance  or \nstorage  schemes,  community  groundwater  development,  erosion  control  or  social  forestry \nmeasures,  shelterbelts,  domestic  water  supply  schemes,  or  any  other  feasible  civil  works  or \nnatural  resources  management  intervention  considered  to  be  of  high  priority  by  local \npopulations at the village and union level. By the end of the Project, it is estimated that in each \nunion, two to four medium-scale interventions will be undertaken and over the project period the \ncoverage  is  likely  to  extend  to  1,800  community/village  groups  representing  370,000 \nhouseholds.  \n \n19. \nAssistance  in  assessing  development  potential  within  the  union,  identifying  priority \npoverty  targets,  and  preparing  requests  and  submissions  will  be  provided  by  a  national  or \nprovincial  RSP,  national  nongovernment  organization  (NGO),  or  a  local  consulting  company \nrecruited by the Project. Staff of the RSP, NGO, or local company will act in an advisory capacity \nat  both  the  district  and  union  levels  to  assist  in  implementation  of  the  component. \nImplementation  will  be  undertaken  under  the  supervision  of  district  technical  line  agency  staff. \nThese  staff  and  their  offices  will  be  provided  with  technical  and  logistics  support  under  the \nProject  as  appropriate  for  the  interventions  being  undertaken.  Agencies  to  be  supported  will \ninclude  the  district  offices  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  Communications  and  Works,  Forestry, \nCommunity  Development,  and  Soil  Conservation.  Some \nrural \nelectrification  and  range  management  improvement,  will  entail  nondevolved  functions.  For \nthese,  the  relevant  provincial  or  national  agency  will  be  retained  by  the  district  to  undertake \nimplementation. \n \n20. \nTo assist the district line agencies to implement the VUDC and the work with the RSPs \nunder  the  targeted  poverty  alleviation  component,  provision  has  been  made  for  support,  as \nrequired for the district-level line agencies.  \n \n\ninterventions,  such  as \n\n2. \n\nTargeted Poverty Alleviation  \n\n \n21. \nThrough  a  dedicated  Targeted  Poverty  Alleviation  component,  the  Project  also  makes \nprovision  for  small-scale  poverty  alleviation  interventions  targeted  directly  at  small  beneficiary \ngroups of not less than 10 participants. These will include both men\u2019s community organizations \n(MCOs)  and  women\u2019s  community  organizations  (WCOs).  Activities  will  be  demand-based  and \nwill  include  such  small-scale  livelihood  activities  as  the  provision  of  dug-wells,  water  course \nlining,  farmer  field  schools  for  integrated  crop  management,  the  provision  of  livestock  for \nmultiplication, the provision of a basic schoolhouse along with literacy and skills training classes, \nand  minor  water  resource  conservation  and  irrigation  infrastructure  on  a  localized  basis.  Over \nthe  project  period,  about  4,500  MCOs  and  WCOs  are  expected  to  be  formed  with  a  total \nrepresentation of 500,000 households to undertake 10\u201312 small-scale community infrastructure \nschemes in each of the 200 unions. Beneficiary participants will need to provide contributions in \ncash or in kind to varying degrees, based on the policies of the implementing agencies involved. \nSchemes  and  investments  will  be  selected  to  ensure  that  the  benefits  are  experienced  by  as \nwide  a  cross  section  of  the  groups  as  possible  and  to  avoid  appropriation  of  benefits  by \n\n6\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nprivileged  groups  or  individuals.  The  most  efficient  and  effective  means  of  implementing  this \nfund  at  the  community  level  will  be  for  Agency  for  Barani  Area  Development  (ABAD)  to  enter \ninto  contracts  with  RSPs  and  provide  them  with  the  resources  needed  to  scale  up  their \nactivities.14  In  most  of  the  project  districts,  RSPs,15  either  the  National  Rural  Support  Program \n(NRSP)  or  the  Punjab  Rural  Support  Program  (PRSP),  are  already  operating,  undertaking \nlivelihood activities that directly target the poorer sections of the population. Not only do these \nRSPs  already  know  the  conditions  and  potential  of  the  project  districts  but  they  also  have \nestablished programs and contacts in many of the barani areas. \n \n22. \nAn integrated approach  to natural resorces management will  contribute  in increasing \nlivestock  and  farming  productivity  and  hence  enhance  improve  livelihood  opportunities  for  the \nresource-poor  farming  community.  This  component  will  thus  also  include  a  provision  for \ndirected,  demand-driven  research  and  extension  initiatives  to  be  undertaken  by  the  national, \nprovincial,  and  other  research  institutions  present  in  the  barani  areas  of  Punjab,  based  on \nproblems identified by community groups. \n \nDue to lack of income from farm-related activity in barani areas, improvements to off-farm \n23. \nincome  in  employment  and  small  and  microbusiness  can  result  in  major  benefits  to  the \npopulation.  The  Project  will  provide  funding  and  consultancy  to  the  two  RSPs  working  in  the \nproject area to change the current focus on vocational training to a demand-based, employer-\nlinked  effort  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  and  vocational  training  suppliers  with  whom \nthe  RSPs  are  already  in  partnership.  The  Project  will  assist  RSPs  to  develop  entrepreneur \nattitudes  and  small  business  management  training  through  linking  the  RSPs  to  the  programs  of \nthe Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority and other enterprise development and \ntraining programs. In trades where self-employment and small business are possible, vocational \ntraining  will  be  linked  to  entrepreneurship  and  small  business  training  as  well  as  follow-up \nbusiness development services. The Project will strengthen access to microfinance by financing \nsocial  mobilization  costs  of  RSPs  and  required  skills  training  for  beneficiaries.  RSPs  and  banks \n(such as Khushali, Zarai Taraqiati Bank of Pakistan, and others) will then be able to provide credit \nto these mobilized groups from their own funds. (For details see Supplementary Appendix A.) \n \n\n3. \n\nLiteracy Through Skills Training \n\n \n24. \nOne of the primary constraints to development in the project area is the very low literacy \nrate, especially among women. With low, indeed practically nonexistent literacy and numeracy \nskills, it is very difficult for the women to learn new livelihood skills. On the other hand, in a very \ntraditional society it is difficult to promote literacy programs without some kind of incentive over \nand above literacy itself. Combining programs in skills training and literacy is one means of both \novercoming illiteracy and promoting livelihood improvements. This is especially the case if skills \ntraining  can  be  itself  linked  to  rural  finance  programs  so  that  the  skills  can  be  turned  into \ninvestments. \n \n25. \nThis  component  will  thus  aim  at  direct  poverty  alleviation  by  targeting  a  particularly \ndeprived section of the population, namely poor women and girls. It will be based on the results \nof  the  ADB-financed  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  for  Non-Formal  Primary  Education  and \nFunctional Literacy for Rural Women in Selected Barani Areas of Punjab (Non-Formal Primary \n                                                 \n14  Through these partnerships, linkages with other financial institutions, business development services, and related \n\ndevelopment initiatives in the respective union councils and villages will be facilitated.  \n\n15  The  rationale  for  partnering  with  RSPs  and  a  brief  note  on  their  history  and  program  are  presented  in \n\nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEducation).16 This TA is designed to support a program of curriculum development for women\u2019s \nliteracy training through the promotion of livelihood skills, as well as nonformal education.  \n \n26. \nThe  activities  under  this  component  will  be  aimed  directly  at  small  groups  of  10\u201315 \nwomen  participants.  Over  12,000  women  and  girls  are  expected  to  benefit  from  exposure  to \nliteracy and basic skills under the component. Under the supervision of the RSP staff working at \neach  union,  domestic  NGOs  will  be  recruited  to  identify  particularly  vulnerable  and  poverty-\naffected groups and to organize WCOs among them. As groups are formed, the methodologies \nworked out under the Non-Formal Primary Education TA will be applied to a combined program of \nlocation and needs-specific curriculum development, teacher training in the use of the curriculum \nmaterials,  skills  development,  and  literacy  eradication.  Skills  to  be  emphasized  will  include \nactivities  such  as  small-scale  domestic  livelihood  enterprises  like  livestock  raising,  market  and \nkitchen gardening, small-scale handicrafts, food preparation, and tailoring, as well as basic skills \nsuch as household health and sanitation, child care, dietary improvement, food preservation, and \nbasic household finances. The particular skills to be learned will be decided upon by the groups \nthemselves. Support for group formation and supervision will be financed by the Project. \n \n27. \nOne of the roles of the RSP will be to provide linkages to the Department of Literacy and \nNon-Formal  Education  and  other  government  agencies  that  provide  advice  and  undertake \nprograms in the areas of skills development selected by the group members. Another will be to \nestablish  links  to  rural  finance  agencies,  which  may  be  able  to  provide  funding  for  enterprise \ndevelopment. If suitable, the WCOs will be turned into borrowers\u2019 groups for financing provision \nby  rural  finance  agencies.  This  possibility  may  prove  an  incentive  for  group  formation  and \nencourage participation in literacy program. \n\n \n4. \n\nInstitutional and Implementation Support \n\n \n \n28. \nInstitutional and implementation support will include (i) the services of an RSP, domestic \nNGO, or local consulting company to be recruited on contract to provide technical inputs at the \nunion  level  and  to  assist  with  the  implementation  of  the  VUDC;  (ii) international  and  domestic \nconsulting services to help initiate and manage the Project, provide guidance to the community \norganizers,  train  the  staff  of  district  line  agencies,  and  support  the  staff  of  ABAD;  (iii) support \nincluding  transport,  office  space,  and  equipment  as  well  as  incremental  staff  for  a  small \nmanagement  unit  within  the  offices  of  ABAD;  and  (iv) support  to  ABAD  for  the  project \nperformance management system.  \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  main  special  feature  of  the  project  design  is  the  effort  being  made  by  the \nGovernment to ensure that the project management and implementation arrangements conform \nto  the  current  local  government  institutional  structure.  The  present  implementation  and \nmanagement structure has been designed to strengthen and reinforce the newly revamped local \ngovernment structure, giving support to ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to assist the Government with its \ndecentralization  efforts.  By  providing  funding  and  a  defined  task  for  unions  and  districts  to \nperform, the Project is designed to build sound capacity within these institutions and provide a \nmodel for future development projects in the rural and agriculture sectors.  \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n16  The advisory technical assistance is financed through the Poverty Alleviation Cooperation Fund and was approved \n\non 13 October 2004. \n\n8\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThus  far,  only  2%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  have  access  to  collateral-free \n30. \ncredit.  Furthermore,  several  of  the  unions  in  the  barani  areas  do  not  have  access  to  financial \nservices.  In  partnering  with  NRSP  and  PRSP,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  scaling  of  the \noperations of these RSPs to tehsils presently not served  by the  microfinance institutions. This \nwill result in a significant growth of their client base and in turn access to credit for the people in \nthe project area. In addition, the Project makes provision for specific assistance to communities, \nRSPs, and other institutions in business development, market-oriented skills development, and \non- and off-farm enterprise development opportunities.  \n \n31. \nA further special feature is the strengthening of line agencies that will take place at the \ndistrict  level.  Through  the  Project,  improvements  will  be  made  to  ensure  that  these  agencies, \nwhich  under  the  devolution  policy  now  have  the  mandate  for  managing  rural  development \nactivities, have the physical and skills capacity to undertake their responsibilities under a clearly \nset out performance-based and demand-driven contract modality.  \n \n32. \nLastly,  the  Project  will  take  aim  at  one  of  the  major  constraints  to  sustained  livelihood \nimprovement in rural areas of Punjab, i.e., the low educational and skills level of rural women. \nOne component of the Project is expressly designed to help overcome this major deficiency. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nSummary cost estimates for the Project are provided in Table 1. The total project cost is \nestimated  at  $58.6 million,  of  which  the  foreign  exchange  component  is  $12.0 million  and  the \nlocal currency cost equivalent is $46.6 million.

The  Executing \nAgency for the Project will be ABAD, which will be responsible for overall project management \nand monitoring. These tasks will be carried out through a project management unit (PMU) to be \nset  up  in  ABAD\u2019s  head  office  in  Rawalpindi.  The  PMU  will  be  staffed  by  a  full-time  project \ndirector,  a  deputy  project  director,  two  full-time  accountants,  three  environmental  compliance \nofficers,  three  social  and  gender  compliance  officers,  a  project  benefit  monitoring  officer,  and \nappropriate  administrative    staff.  A  district  project  manager  (DPM)  and  a  district  project \naccountant will be appointed within one month of loan effectiveness by ABAD for each Project \ndistrict. The staffing for the PMU is shown in Supplementary Appendix K. A team of international \nand domestic consultants will assist ABAD and the respective district governments in the initial \nyears of the Project\u2019s operation. Their initial role will be to help with project start-up and to assist \nwith  the  identification  of  a  menu  of  interventions  for  the  VUDC.  Later  they  will  advise  on  the \ntechnical aspects of proposed project interventions. \n \n36. \nThe district governments of the 10 project districts will be the implementing agencies for \nthe VUDC. They will be responsible for day-to-day management of the component. The district \ngovernment  will  be  supported  and  guided  by  the  DPMs  and  the  district  project  accountants \nprovided by ABAD as well as by the international and local consultants. ABAD itself will be the \nimplementing agency for the other components of the Project. \n \n37. \nBroad  oversight  of  the  Project  and  its  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  a  project \nsteering  committee.  This  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  chairperson,  planning  and \ndevelopment, of the government of Punjab and will be made up of the secretaries of the key line \nagencies17,  director  general  of  ABAD,  and  representatives    of  the  RSPs  participating  in  the \nProject. The district coordination officer of each district covered by the Project may participate in \nthe meeting  as required. The committee will meet at least once every 6 months to review the \nprogress of the Project and to act on any issues in need of resolution at the provincial level. \n                                                 \n17  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Livestock,  Department  of  Literacy  and  Non  Formal,  Department  of \nCommunication  and  Works,  Department  of  Housing,  Urban  Development  and  Public  Health  Engineering, \nDepartment of Local Government and Rural Development, Department of Education, Department of Forestry, and \nDepartment of Finance.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n38. \nImplementation  of  the  VUDC  may  involve  a  number  of  different  line  agencies  at  the \ndistrict level. For the coordination and oversight of its implementation, each district government \nwill appoint within one month of loan effectives an executive district officer  as the district project \ncoordinator to coordinate and implement  the VUDC. \n \n39. \nA  district  project  implementation  committee  (DPIC)  will  supervise  and  monitor  the \nactivities  of  the  project  at  the  district  level.  The  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  respective \ndistrict coordination officers18and consist of, among other people, the district project coordinator \nas  the  secretary,  the  DPM  (from  ABAD),  and  a  representative  of  the  rural  support  program \nresponsible for social mobilization.  The chair of the DPIC will  will determine and nominate any \nother member it deems necessary to be included in the DPIC. \n \n40. \nA  project  consultative  forum  made  up  of  elected  representatives  of  the  10  project \ndistricts,  representatives  of  civil  society,  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  be  selected  by  the \ngovernment  of  Punjab  will  be  established  within  the  first  year  of  the  Project.  The  forum  will \nconsult with ABAD semiannually.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation of the Village and Union Development Component \n\n \nA  flow  chart  showing  the  procedures  for  the  selection  and  approval  of  interventions \n41. \nunder  the  VUDC  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L.  Proposals  for  funding  under  the \nVUDC  will  be  generated  in  the  villages  in  each  union  by  the  resident  population  of  the  area. \nABAD  will  hire  a  known  and  proven  RSP,  domestic  NGO,  or  local  consulting  company  to \nprovide personnel skilled in community mobilization (village and union coordinators) to help with \nthese activities in each district. The proposals, prepared with the assistance of the village and \nunion  coordinators,  will  be  assessed  and  prioritized  by  the  union  council.  The  endorsed,  high \npriority, interventions will be submitted for technical assessment by the district line agencies and \napproval by the district development committee.  \n \n42. \nTo assist the district line agencies to implement the VUDC, provision has been made for \nsupport,  as  required,  on  an  identified  needs  basis.  This  support  will  be  determined  during  the \nevaluation  of  the  union  council  proposals  by  the  district  development  committee.  As  the  line \nagencies  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  union  council  proposals,  they  will  also  assess  their  own \nneeds in order to implement the works involved. This support may include incremental staff on \ncontract, equipment, or training. These requirements will be costed and submitted as part of the \noverall proposal to the district development committee (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nUpon  technical  approval,  the  proposals  will  be  resubmitted  as  PC1s19  (where \n43. \nappropriate) to the district development committee for final approval of funding. Implementation \nwill  be  undertaken  by  the  district  line  agencies  following  standard  government  of  Punjab \nprocedures  and  practices.  During  implementation,  the  union  council  will  be  tasked  with \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  implementation  and  ensuring  full  beneficiary  participation  in  the \nfunded works. The Project will also provide support to build the capacity of the union council to \nensure  effective  monitoring  of  the  activities  under  this  component.  This  will  be  done  in \n\n                                                 \n18 The district coordination officer is the senior civil servant in the district as provided under Punjab Local Government \n\n19 Planning Commission Proforma 1 (PC1) \u2013  A document prepared  by the  Government to appraise  all investments \n\nOrdinance 2001. \n\nexceeding $25,000 (equivalent). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n \n\n \n\ncoordination with other ADB efforts to build the capacity of union administration (such as ADB\u2019s \nDecentralization Support Program and the proposed Punjab Devolved  Social Service Project). \nThe  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  necessary  accountability  and  transparency \nmechanism  under  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  will  be  adopted  to  ensure \neffective implementation and monitoring of the Project. \n \n44. \nABAD, along with the project management consultants provided to it, will be responsible \nfor  reviewing  proposals  approved  by  the  district  development  committee  to  ensure  that  the \nunion councils are making effective judgments on the proposals that they accept and that valid \nproposals  are  being  approved  at  the  district  level.  Any  issues  or  anomalies  will  be  reported \ninitially  to  the  district  project  implementation  committee  and  then  to  the  project  steering \ncommittee.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Component \n\n \n45. \nThe  targeted  poverty  alleviation  component  will  be  undertaken  by  an  RSP  currently \nworking in the district concerned. At present NRSP is working, to a greater or lesser degree, in \nsix of the 10 districts and PRSP is working in the other four. ABAD will enter into an agreement \nwith NRSP and PRSP to formalize arrangements for the upscaling of their activities under the \nProject.  This  agreement  will  be  based  on  a  work  plan  submitted  to  ABAD  and  the  district \ngovernment  by  the  RSP  concerned.  The  funds  provided  will  amount  to  around  $50,000 \nequivalent  for  each  union  and  will  be  used  to  support  community-based  livelihood  activities \ntargeted  at  the  poor  through  the  formation  of  MCOs  and  WCOs.  Activities  will  include  the \nformation  of  citizen  community  boards  in  order  to  increase  access  to  the  local  development \nfunding made available to these groups under Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2001. The \nRSPs  will  develop  the  necessary  selection  criteria  for  the  activities  to  be  funded  under  this \ncomponent.  A  committee,  to  include  representations  from  the  participating  RSPs  and  the \nparticipating  district  governments  and  union  administration,  will  be  established  to  select  the \nproposals.  Where  possible,  RSPs  will  provide  training  and  necessary  support  for  business \npromotion  and  enterprise  development  through  collaboration  with  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise  Development  Authority  and  others  as  appropriate  to  help  maximize  access  of \nbeneficiaries to the credit lines available from other sources in the Project. Activities of the RSPs \nwill be undertaken in general coordination with the district project manager. The RSPs will also \nbe  required  to  submit  semi-annual  reports  to  the  zila  council  and  union  council  on  the \nimplementation of its activities.   \n  \n \n \n46. \nLiteracy  and  skills-based  training  will  be  undertaken  by  domestic  NGOs  recruited  by \nABAD on the recommendation of the RSP, the concerned executive district officer, literacy and \nthe  Department  of  Literacy  and  Non-Formal  Education.  The  NGO  will  operate  under  the \ncoordination  of  the  district  project  manager  in  consultation  with  the  district  RSP  and  the \nexecutive  district  officer,  literacy.  The  selection  of  skills-based  activities  to  be  promoted  along \nwith literacy training will be based on proposals made by community organizations to the NGO \nand or the RSP. Training materials prepared under the Non-Formal Primary Education TA will \nbe used to support location- and needs-specific curriculum validation, teacher training in the use \nof this curriculum, as well as institutional linkages, skills development, and illiteracy eradication.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nImplementation of the Literacy Through Skills Training Component \n\n4. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nin \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation and Start-Up \n\n \n \n47. \nIn view of the need for a careful start-up period during which the unions are informed of \nthe project and proposals from villages are assembled, as well as the need for community group \nformation, a rather long project implementation period is necessary, namely 6 years, including 1 \nyear for start-up and 5 years for project implementation. A proposed implementation schedule is \nshown in Appendix 6.  The  Executing  Agency,  ABAD,  has  experience \nimplementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  The  RSPs  all  have  extensive  experience  of  community \norganization  and  mobilization  in  rural  Pakistan.  There  is,  however,  concern  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  that  the  initiation  of  the  Project  will  be  constrained  by  the  weaknesses  that  are \nendemic to governance in the context of rural development projects generally in Pakistan, which \ninclude  delays  in  appointing  staff  and  consultants  responsible  for  implementation  and  by \nproblems  that  may  arise  as  a  result  of  the  recent  devolution  of  powers  to  the  district  level,  in \nview of staff vacancies and lack of a full systems and procedures. Systems and procedures will \nneed  to  be  set  up  that  conform  to  both  the  requirements  of  the  government  of  Punjab  and  to \nthose of ADB. Within the first 6 months, it will be necessary to have, recruited and operational, a \nfull complement of staff within the PMU, the full team of consultants, and the village and union \norganizers  and  their  supervisors.  During  the  following  6  months,  pilot  activities  will  be \nundertaken in one union in each district to test community mobilization and opportunities for off-\nfarm employment generation.  \n \n48.  \nFurther critical activities to be undertaken during the first year will include the preparation \nof  environmental  impact  assessment  and  a  gender  action  plan.  These  will  be  prepared  as  a \nbasis to check all proposed interventions under the VUDC for potential impacts and to suggest \npossible mitigation measures if required. \n \n \n \nProcurement will be undertaken following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. In terms of \n49. \nthe procurement of vehicles and equipment, no large purchases are required. The procurement \nof  these  items  will  thus  be  undertaken  using  either  direct  purchase  or  international  shopping \nupon  identification  of  the  needs  of  the  implementing  agencies.  Civil  works  will  be  small    to \nmedium  scale  and  scattered,  and  will  thus  not  be  suitable  for  or  of  interest  to  international \ncontractors. Moreover, there is adequate capacity to undertake the works required in a suitable \nmanner  and  at  reasonable  cost.  Civil  works  will  thus  be  undertaken  through  local  competitive \nbidding  for  local  companies  or  by  direct  selection  for  beneficiary  user  groups  by  utilizing \ncommunity participation procedures in procurement. In the latter case, disbursement will be on \nthe basis of a statement of expenditures with a portion of the funding being provided by ABAD \nas an initial start-up payment. The procurement packages are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  require  support  from  399  person-months  of  consulting  services \ncomprising 42 person months of international consulting services and 357 months of domestic \nconsulting  services.  International  consulting  services  will include  expertise  in  the  management \nof rural development projects, environmental impact screening and mitigation, social and gender \nimpact  screening  and  mitigation,  groundwater  use  and  monitoring,  and  project  financial \nmanagement.  Domestic  consulting  services  will  consist  of  specialists  in  project  administration, \ncommunity  organization,  agriculture,  livestock,  rural  engineering,  water  conservation,  natural \nresource  management,  off-farm  enterprise  development  and \nfacilitating \nmobilization at union level. Consulting services will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nProcurement \n\ntraining,  and \n\n7. \n\n6. \n\n \n\n\f14\n \n\n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nthe Use of Consulting Services and other arrangements for recruitment of domestic consultants \nacceptable to ADB. With the exception of the international project management specialist who \nwill  be  recruited  early  on  as  an  individual  consultant,  international  and  local  consultants  and \nunion and district supervisors will be recruited through a firm or an NGO/RSP using the quality \nand cost-based system. In addition, using the quality and cost-based system, ABAD will recruit \nthe services of rural support programs, NGOs, or local consulting companies for the village and \nunion organizers who will work directly in the field with the union administrations, villages, and \ndistrict agencies to provide on the ground support for the VUDC. About 1,080 person-months of \nvillage  and  union  organizer  input  will  be  required.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consultants \nand the union organizers are shown in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n \n \n51. \nThe  funds  for  the  ABAD-executed  components  (targeted  poverty  alleviation,  literacy \nthrough skills training, and institutional and implementation support) will be channeled through \ngovernment budgetary allocations directly from the Department of Finance to the PMU. Funds \nfor  these  components  will  then  be  apportioned  to  the  implementing  agency  through  ABAD. \nProject initiation and implementation will be facilitated through the establishment of an imprest \naccount  so  that  funds  will  be  available  and  at  the  disposal  of  ABAD  at  the  initiation  of  the \nProject.  For  this  purpose,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  National  Bank  of \nPakistan in Rawalpindi. The initial advance to the imprest  account will be based on estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the project or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nDetailed arrangements for the establishment and operation of the imprest accounts will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n52. \nThe VUDC funds will be transferred directly by the government of Punjab into separate \ndedicated  project  accounts  at  the  district  level.  These  funds  will  be  disbursed  upon  the  final \nclearance  by  ABAD  of  the  village  and  union  proposals,  after  they  have  been  approved  by  the \ndistrict  development  committee.  The  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  activities  of  district  line \nagencies,  contractors,  suppliers,  or  beneficiary  groups  under  the  VUDC.  For  this  component, \nimprest  accounts  will  not  be  required.  The  government  of  Punjab  has  assured  that  upon  loan \neffectiveness and promptly every 6 months thereafter, adequate funds will be transferred for the \nplanned  project  activities.  These  expenditures  will  be  reimbursed  using  standard  withdrawal \nprocedures.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible \nexpenditures  and  liquidating  the  imprest  account  for  any  individual  payment  transaction  up  to \n$50,000  equivalent.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  available  by  the  Borrower  to  the \ngovernment of Punjab on the same terms and conditions as those between ADB and the Borrower. \nThe funds flow chart is shown in  Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounts Audits and Reports \n\n \n53. \nThe government of Punjab will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for \nfunds provided to the Project. These accounts and related financial statements will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB, and will include an audit with a separate opinion on the \nuse  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  The  government  of \nPunjab will furnish ADB with the audited accounts and statements not later than 6 months after \nthe end of the related fiscal year. ABAD will submit to ADB, diagnostic quarterly reports detailing \nthe  project  progress  to  date,  problems  encountered,  measures  taken  to  overcome  them,  and \nexpected progress over the next 6 months, as well as any major or serious issues that need to \nbe expeditiously addressed. Six months prior to the completion of the Project, ABAD will submit \na  project  completion  report  to  ADB,  detailing  the  utilization  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nimplementation  analysis,  and  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. \n \n\n10. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n \n54. \nThe government of Punjab has provided assurance that all facilities provided under the \nProject  will  be  operated  and  maintained  following  best  practices  within  the  country.  The \ngovernment  of  Punjab  has  thus  agreed  that  all  proposals  from  union    must  include  (i) an \nindication  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  arrangements  to  be  followed  upon \ncompletion  of  project  facilities  and  (ii) a  commitment  that  these  arrangements  will  be  put  into \nplace.  Where  the  responsibility  lies  with  the  district,  provincial,  or  national  government,  the \nrespective agency will give a written commitment to accept the responsibility for O&M under its \nregular recurrent budget. Certain investments, for example rural roads and rural electrification, \nhave  established  O&M  procedures.  In  recent  years,  under  the  Medium  Term  Budgetary \nFramework (2004/5\u20132007/8), an increasing and dedicated recurrent budget has been provided \nfor  infrastructure  and  O&M  benchmarks  have  also  been  upgraded.  Furthermore  any  rural \nelectrification scheme linked to the national grid becomes part of the operational responsibility of \nthe regional power board and will be maintained according to national standards. Other facilities \nwill be operated and maintained according to best practices within their particular sector. Where \npossible this will entail operation by the beneficiaries using their own funding. \n \n \n \n55. \nAn ongoing project performance management system (PPMS) will be established within \n1  year  of  loan  effectiveness.  A  specific  position  on  the  PMU  has  been  designated  for  a \nmonitoring specialist and this person, with support from consultants, will ensure the operation of \nthe  PPMS  throughout  the  project  period.  At  the  beginning  of  the  Project  and  not  later  than  6 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  specific  indicators  will  be  identified  and  further  firmed  up  as  a \nbasis for implementation and monitoring. A database of information will be established at ABAD \nand consist of information collected at all stages, including baseline, surveys, subproject profiles \n(at  initiation),  annual  monitoring  surveys,  impact  studies,  etc.  Day  to  day  monitoring  of  the \nVUDC  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  concerned  union  council  through  its  monitoring \ncommittees.  Implementation  monitoring  for  the  targeted  poverty  alleviation  component  will  be \ndone by the RSPs themselves following their standard procedures. A framework for monitoring \nliteracy  through  skills  training  component  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with  RSPs,  locally \nrecruited  NGOs,  and  participants  of  the  literacy  program  who  in  turn  will  also  provide \nrecommendations for indicators to be developed for tracking the usefulness of training in further \ndeveloping  market-oriented  skills  and \nfurther  details  see \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nlinkages.  For \n\ninstitutional \n\n11. \n\n \n12. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n56. \nABAD  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  project  review  semiannually.  After  3  years  of \nimplementation,  a  full  midterm  review  will  be  undertaken,  which  will  include  a  comprehensive \nevaluation  of  the  project  implementation  arrangements  and  project  progress  to  date.  It  will \ninclude  consultations  with \nline  agencies,  union \nadministrations,  council  members,  and  targeted  beneficiaries.  If  necessary,  recommendations \nwill  be  made  for  adjustments  to  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  cost \nestimates. \n \n \n\nthe  district  development  committee, \n\n \n\n\f16\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n\n \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \nGeneral.  The  Project  will  enhance  the  livelihood  and  quality  of  life  of  about  350,000 \n57. \nhouseholds  living  in  the  rural  areas  of  200  disadvantaged  and  poor  unions  in  Punjab,  which \nhave marginal natural resource endowments and weak social and institutional capacities. Direct \nincome  enhancement  will  be  achieved  by  increased  access  to  markets  and  inputs  for  crop \nagriculture and livestock production; improved access to water for crop irrigation (including the \nproduction  of  fodder  crops),  livestock  watering,  and  domestic  supplies;  the  improvement  of \nrangelands and pastures; the provision of access to electricity to allow for a variety of productive \nactivities,  including  off-farm  enterprises  and  access  to  improved  agriculture  techniques  and \ntechnologies especially adapted to arid conditions. In addition, poorer groups in the project area \n(about 70,000 households) will be specially targeted for programs that foster income enhancing \nactivities  through  training  in  new  skills,  access  to  credit,  small-scale  communal  infrastructure, \nand the provision of social support through schools and health posts. \n \n58. \nGovernance and Institutional Aspects. The Project, in its mobilization efforts, will aim \nto  support  and  strengthen  the  current  move  to  devolution  as  promulgated  under  the  Local \nGovernment Ordinance of 2001. It will orient communities to deal with the various service delivery \ndepartments  and  make  them  aware  that  they  do  not  need  to  seek  patronage  and  favors  of  the \nstrong or influential when operating as a collectivity. It will further strengthen the new institutions \nat  the  union  and  district  level  in  the  project  area  to  make  them  responsive  to  identified \ncommunity  needs.  These  interventions  can  positively  impact  on  service  delivery  structures  and \nmechanisms  for  rural  infrastructure,  water  management  and  conservation,  rural  electrification, \nagriculture extension, livestock production, primary education and health, and improve quality of life \nand access to markets and opportunities for the population of the barani areas. \n \nPoverty, Gender, and Participation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy \n59. \nis  provided  in  Appendix 8.  It  is  the  overall  intent  of  the  Project  that  it  should  have  a  positive \nsocial impact on the population of the project area through poverty alleviation, an improvement \nin  the  status  of  women,  increases  in  rural  employment  possibilities  and  household  incomes, \nincreases  in  rates  of  literacy,  increases  in  the  general  health  of  the  population,  and  a  general \nimprovement  in  the  quality  of  life.  The  Project  is  not  only  designed  to  provide  improved \ninfrastructure  to  the  populations  of  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  deprived  villages  in  the \ncountry,  but  also  to  specifically  target  poor  segments  of  the  population  and  deprived  and \nunderprivileged  groups.  The  Project  will  have  widespread  positive  impact  on  the  lives  of  poor \nand  vulnerable  inhabitants  of  the  barani  areas\u2014small  farmers  or  herders,  the  landless,  and \nwomen and children. The overall implementation and delivery modalities being proposed for the \nProject will contribute to and social development, and minimize asset inequalities generated by \nthe ability of the local elite to influence public expenditure. The involvement of local NGOs, and \nprovincial and national RSPs staffed with an adequate gender balance, will enable the Project to \nwork with organized community groups and utilize the necessary range of targeting methods to \nreach  specific  population  groups  and  individual  households,  reduce  social  barriers,  and \nmaximize the positive impact on women.  \n \n60. \nProject  activities  identified,  designed,  and  implemented  by  communities,  including \nwomen,  according  to  their  needs  and  circumstances  will  improve  food  security  and  nutrition, \naccess  to  productive  resources  and  goods  and  services,  skills  and  knowledge,  and  the \nawareness  of  rights  and  the  ability  to  exercise  those  rights,  among  the  poor  and  excluded. \nWomen will be drawn into the mainstream by their involvement in support activities for livestock \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nin \n\ninvolved \n\nthe  beneficiaries \n\nthemselves  will  be \n\ndevelopment  and  in  the  layout  and  management  of  domestic  water  supply  schemes.  Adult \nliteracy and skills development for women will positively impact on their self-esteem and status. \nIndirectly,  the  advocacy  of  literate  women  will  help  ensure  the  enrollment  of  girls  in  schools. \nConsistent with ADB\u2019s  policy on indigenous peoples, no plan for indigenous peoples needs to \nbe prepared, as all groups will equally benefit from project interventions. \n \n61. \nResettlement.  The  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  include  small-  to \nmedium-scale  investments  that  are  selected  by  the  beneficiaries  in  a  demand-driven  process. \nExamples include rural access roads built upon existing dirt tracks, village electrification, small \nwater  conveyance  structures,  and  range  improvements.  The  scale  and  nature  of  the  activities \nare  such  that  those  that  might  potentially  be  affected  by  access  ways  will  almost  always  be \nthose  directly  benefiting  from  the  investment.  No  involuntary  resettlement  effects  are  foreseen \nidentifying,  designing,  and \nbecause \nimplementing  the  subproject  activities.  The  Government  has  provided  an  assurance  that  any \nsubprojects that may involve involuntary resettlement would not be included within the scope of \nthe Project. \n \n62. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  As  most  of  the  proposed  project  interventions  will  be  small  to \nmedium scale and spread over a large area, significant environmental impacts are not expected \nas  a  result  of  the  Project.  No  significant  impacts  are  expected  from  the  rural  infrastructure \ninterventions  since  existing  rights-of-way  will  be  used  for  any  road  improvements  or  the \nupgrading  of  walking  trails  to  jeepable  tracks.  Similarly,  rural  electrification  is  not  expected  to \nhave  any  significant  impacts  on  the  environment  through  which  low  kilovolt  power  lines  are \nconstructed.  Most  agricultural  or  livestock  interventions  will  be  environmentally  positive, \nresulting  in  enhanced  ground  cover  or  improved  pasture.  Water  storage  or  conservation \ninterventions may have positive effects by reducing erosion (which is a very serious problem in \nthe barani areas). Large amounts of fertilizer or pesticide are not used on barani crops due to \nthe risk of crop losses or crop failure, thus the overuse of agro-chemicals as a result of project \ninterventions is also considered unlikely. Several possible and suggested interventions depend \non the use of groundwater either for irrigation, livestock, or domestic water supply. In using the \ngroundwater  resource,  there  is  a  risk  of  both  overexploitation  resulting  in  the  nonsustainable \ndepletion  of  the  resource  and  overuse  in  inappropriate  soils,  resulting  in  salinization  or \nsodicization.  An  important  part  of  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  water  conservation  consultant \nwill thus be to check the status of the groundwater resource in the project area and to provide \nguidelines  on  groundwater  use  to  the  districts,  unions,  and  RSPs  prior  to  the  identification  of \npossible  project  interventions  at  the  village  level.  As  an  additional  check  on  environmental \nconcerns, a consultant will be recruited at the initiation of the Project to prepare guidelines and \nprovide training on environmental screening for proposed interventions for the VUDC. Full-time \nenvironmental specialists will be recruited as part of the project management unit to ensure that \nthe  screening  takes  place  for  each  proposed  project  activity.  A  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination of a typical subproject is attached in Appendix 9. Environmental assessment review \nprocedures are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n \n\n63. \nEconomic and Financial Analysis. Investments to be supported by the Project follow a \ndemand-driven,  process  approach.  The  main  beneficiaries  will  be  the  farmers,  landless \nlaborers, the unemployed and/or underemployed,  livestock holders, women, and children. The \nproject  interventions  pursue  both  efficiency  and  equity  objectives.  The  economic  analysis  is \nbased  on  indicative  model  budgets  of  potential  interventions,  which  include  agriculture  and \nnatural  resource  management,  small-scale  community  infrastructure,  and  literacy  and  skills \ntraining.  The  indicative  models  assess  quantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  costs  and  benefits, \n\n \n\n\f18\n \n\n \n\nimpact on income and poverty, economic viability, and distribution. A more detailed discussion \nof the economic and financial analysis is presented in Appendix 10.20  \n \n64. \nThere  are  ranges  of  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  subprojects,  with \nmost clustering near 20% or higher. Sensitivity analysis shows that most EIRRs remain robust \nwhen  subprojects  are  subjected  to  price  fluctuations,  decreases  in  benefits,  or  cost  overruns. \nBased  on  representative  farm  models,  most  increases  in  income  are  between  PRs2,000  and \nPRs9,000  per  hectare  annually.  Though  each  subproject  varies  in  term  of  its  distribution  of \nbenefits, it is anticipated that most benefits will accrue to the poor, especially small farmers. It is \nestimated that 70% of the benefits from irrigation and natural resource management will go to \nsmall farmers. Most of the project interventions are labor intensive, and hence will require both \nskilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  implementation.  The  Project  will  also  generate  demand  for \nseasonal  labor  commensurate  with  the  increases  in  crop  and  livestock  productivity  and  other \nrelated  economic  activities  (transport  and  rural  electrification).  Project  support  for  skills \nenhancement will encourage the labor force to train for gainful employment, facilitate reduction \nof unemployment and contribute to household income.  \n \n65. \nSustainability.  Two  particular  factors  provide  confidence  that  the  project  interventions \nwill be sustainable. First, the subprojects will be beneficiary-selected and involve contributions \nby  beneficiaries  of  time  and  investment.  A  formalized,  well-defined  plan  and  commitment  to \nO&M  is  a  prerequisite  for  pursuing  most  subprojects.  Beneficiaries,  who  are  involved  from \ndesign  onward,  will  be  motivated  to  ensure  that  project  facilities  are  well  maintained  and \nfunctional.  Second,  some  of  the  larger  investments,  for  example  rural  roads  and  rural \nelectrification,  have  established  O&M  procedures.  Rural  roads  are  maintained  by  the  district \ngovernments  and,  in  recent  years  under  the  devolution  process,  increasing  funds  have  been \nallocated specifically for O&M. Furthermore, rural electrification schemes linked to the national \ngrid  become  part  of  the  operational  responsibility  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority and will be maintained according to national standards.21  \n \nB. \n \n66. \nThe  major  risks  for  the  Project  include:  (i) lack  of  capacity  of  district  line  agencies; \n(ii) lack  of  accountability  at  the  district-level  institutions;  (iii) lack  of  capacity  in  community \nmobilization;  (iv) insufficient  monitoring  capacity  for  tracking  the  widespread  subprojects; \n(v) lack  of  social,  gender,  and  environmental  safeguards;  (vi) political \ninfluence  and \nappropriation of project activities; and (vii) deficient O&M. For item (i), the Project provides for a \nspecific  budget  for  line  agency  support  in  implementation.  In  pursuit  of  accountability  (item  ii), \nthe  design  has \nin \nimplementation;  the  flow  of  funds  for  VUDC  is  through  the  government  system  and  within  the \npurview of the Department of Finance; under local devolution, monitoring committees have been \nestablished;  and,  finally,  mobilized  community  organizations  are  to  act  as  concerned  interest \n\nindependent  participants  and \n\ninvolved  a  number  of \n\ninstitutions \n\nRisks  \n\n                                                 \n20 Supplementary Appendix E provides further details on the analyses of subproject investments and possible impact \n\non beneficiaries. \n\n21 The project performance audit report for the Second Punjab Barani Area Development Project confirmed that the \nrural  roads  improved  under  that  project  continue  to  be  well  maintained  and  in  good  condition.  The  PPAR  also \nconfirms that irrigation facilities provided under that project were well maintained by the owners and that buildings \nand equipment, which were transferred to the Government\u2019s regular budget after project completion, continue to be \nwell maintained. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ngroups. For enhancing capacity in community  organization (item iii), the Project has cultivated \nthe  participation  of  RSPs.  These  institutions  already  have  well-established  programs,  staff, \nprocedures,  and  monitoring  systems.  Also,  because  of  their  size  and  reputation,  these \ninstitutions can (i) resist local political pressures to sway activities, and (ii) advocate on behalf of \nthe  communities  if  difficulties  arise.  For  monitoring  (item  iv),  the  Project  provides  adequate \nconsultancy  services,  staff  resources,  and  a  realistic  framework.  For  social,  gender,  and \nenvironmental safeguards (item v), consultants are engaged early to establish a framework for \nscreening  subprojects.  To  counter  political  interference  (item  vi),  there  are  defined  subproject \nselection  criteria  and  a  range  of  participants  involved  in  the  project  process.  Concerns  over \nO&M  (item  vii)  are  addressed  by  requiring  upfront  beneficiary  contribution  supplemented  by \nclearly defined agreements between communities and responsible agencies.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n67. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  within  one  year  of  the  loan  effectiveness  all \nrelevant vacant posts in key district line agencies within project area will be filled \nwith full-time staff.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  Punjab  will  transfer  funds  for  the  planned \nactivities  under  the  VUDC  subject  to  the  fulfillment  by  project  districts  and  their \nrespective    unions  of  the  eligibility  criteria  under  Appendix 11.  The  Government \nwill also ensure that Punjab will transfer in a timely manner adequate counterpart \nfunds  to  ABAD  in  its  annual  budget  to  implement  effectively  the  components \nunder the Project other than VUDC. \nThe  Government  will  establish  within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness  a  PPMS. \nThe Government will ensure that within 6 months of loan effectiveness the PMU \nwill develop criteria for monitoring project implementation and project impact. \nThe Government will ensure that the PMU will be fully staffed within one month of \nloan effectiveness. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  activities  proposed  for  the  VUDC  will  only \nbe approved if the beneficiaries and union concerned clearly indicate the degree \nof  beneficiary  contribution.  The  beneficiaries  and  the  union  must  indicate  the \narrangements  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  scheme  proposed  and \nprovide  written  commitments  on \nthese \narrangements.  \nThe Government will ensure that within six months of loan effectiveness Punjab \nwill  develop  appropriate  framework  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  all \ninvestments made under VUDC. \nThe Government will ensure that Punjab will develop the selection criteria for the \ninterventions  to  be  financed  under  the  targeted  poverty  alleviation  component \nwithin one month of the loan effectiveness. \n\ntheir  willingness \n\nto  comply  with \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  land  to  be  utilized  for  this  Project,  where \npossible, will not involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts,  including  loss of  income,  resources,  or  assets \nfor  the  nontitled.  Accordingly,  any  subproject  that  may  involve  involuntary \nresettlement would not be included within the scope of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f20\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nin  the  initial  environmental  examination  are  incorporated  into  the  Project  design \nand  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. \ntimely  development  and  effective \nThe  Government  will  ensure \nimplementation  of  the  Gender  Action  Plan  to  ensure  the  equitable  and  full \nparticipation of women in Project activities.  \n\nthe \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following were agreed upon as conditions for effectiveness of the loan after Board \n\n \nB. \n \n68. \napproval: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe project steering committee will have been formally established. \nApproved arrangements for the flow of project funding are in place between the \nprovincial government and the district governments.  \nThe  approval  by  government  of  Punjab  of  the  procedures  and  criteria  for \nactivities under the VUDC has been obtained. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n69. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  27,207,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Sustainable \nLivelihoods in Barani Areas Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n \n23 November 2004 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1          21     \n\nTHE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND THE BARANI SUBSECTOR \n \n\nThe Agriculture Sector \n\nA. \n \nAgriculture  remains  the  backbone  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economy.  Agricultural  production \n1. \naccounts  for  23.3%  of  gross  domestic  product, 42%  of  employment,  and  70%  of  exports.  It  is \nalso the largest source of foreign exchange earnings. Moreover, agriculture supplies 60% of the \nraw materials for the industry sector, primarily cotton, sugar, wool, and leather, and comprises a \nsubstantial  market  for  industrial  products  in  the  form  of  machinery  and  agricultural  inputs  and \nmaterials.  \n \n2. \nDue to the country\u2019s generally arid climate, over 90% of the total crop output comes from \nirrigated  land.  One  of  the  country\u2019s  main  attributes  is  its  large  and  extensive  canal  irrigation \nnetwork, comprising one of the largest irrigated systems in the world.  This network, along with a \ntropical/subtropical  climate  and  relatively  fertile  soils,  represents  a  productive  asset  and  the \ncountry\u2019s  main  economic  base.  Major  crops  produced  include  wheat,  cotton,  rice,  sugarcane, \nand fodder crops; however, the country has recently begun moving to higher value crops such \nas citrus and other fruits for export. Through a combination of development efforts and improved \ntechnology  (primarily  the  use  of  high  yielding  varieties  and  fertilizers),  Pakistan  attained  food \nself-sufficiency  in  the  1980s  but  has  since  struggled  to  maintain  this  situation  due  to  a  lack  of \nprice incentives and a continually increasing population.  \n \n3. \nA major component of the agriculture sector is the livestock subsector, which accounts \nfor  about  49%  of  value  added  in  the  sector  and  11.4%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Almost  all \nrural  households  raise  livestock  and  this  accounts  for  some  30\u201340%  of  household  income  on \naverage.  The  livestock  population  consists  of  cattle,  buffalo,  sheep,  goats,  camels,  horses, \ndonkeys  and  mules.  Livestock  production  is  important  in  both  irrigated  and  nonirrigated  areas \nbut  tends  to  play  a  more  critical  role  in  nonirrigated  areas.  However,  the  production  of  fodder \ncrops and poultry feed constitutes an increasingly important aspect of irrigated agriculture. \n \n4. \nOverall,  agricultural  growth  has  been  unimpressive  over  the  past  decade  or  so.  While \nneighboring countries have been growing more rapidly, Pakistan\u2019s agricultural growth during the \n1990s  averaged  about  only  3%,  staying  just  ahead  of  average  population  growth  of  2.5%. \nMoreover,  a  particularly  serious  drought  lasting  from  late  2001  to  2003  had  a  significantly \nnegative  impact  on  the  sector  in  2001  and  2002,  despite  the  fact  that  most  of  the  country\u2019s \nagriculture  is  irrigated.  The  agriculture  sector  suffered  declines  of  2.7%  in  2001  and  0.1%  in \n2002.1  There  was,  however,  a  recovery  in  2003,  with  growth  up  by  4.1%,  albeit  from  the \nreduced drought production levels.  \n \n5. \nConstraints  on  growth  in  the  sector  include  imperfections  in  land  markets  and  land \ndistribution  (including  a  high  degree  of  fragmentation);  inefficiencies  in  irrigation  management \nincluding excessive losses and inequitable distribution; deterioration in land quality due to poor \nirrigation  practices;  an  inadequate  rural  transport  network  resulting  in  limited  access  to  inputs \nand  to  markets;  inefficiencies  as  a  result  of  public  sector  involvement  in  input  and  output \nmarkets; and restricted access to credit by small farmers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Pakistan. 2004. Pakistan Economic Survey 2003\u201304. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f22          Appendix 1 \n\nThe Barani Subsector \n\nB. \n \n6. \nBarani areas are outside the major canal commands. These constitute about one quarter \nof the cultivated land area of the country, but account for only 10% of crop production. These \nlands are very diverse and range from upland mountain areas to lowland, semidesert areas at \nthe fringes of, or out of reach of, the canal-irrigated command areas. In some cases, especially \nin the north, sufficient water is available for annual cropping. While in others, drought resistant \ncrops predominate, and yet in others, crops are planted on a speculative basis and abandoned \nor used as fodder for livestock if rains are insufficient to bring the crop to maturity.  \n \n7. \nThe  crops  grown  and  the  cropping  patterns  in  barani  areas  also  differ  from  irrigated \nareas.  Minor,  drought-resistant crops  such  as chickpea,  peanut,  and  oilseeds  are  common.  In \ntwo  of  the  proposed  project  districts,  the  barani  areas  account  for  80%  of  the  chickpea \nproduction of the whole province. Drought-resistant wheat is also tried where sufficient moisture \nis available, especially in the more northerly areas. Livestock accounts for a much larger portion \nof household income than in irrigated areas, estimated at about 70% by the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance consultants. \n \n8. \nWhile some barani areas now have some access to water through tube wells and small \nwater  conservation  structures  (such  as  small  dams),  the  dependency  on  rainfall  and  thus  the \nsusceptibility to drought is much greater than in irrigated areas. Farming on barani lands is thus \na much more precarious occupation than farming within the irrigated command areas. The most \nrecent 2001\u20132003 drought had a devastating effect on many  barani areas, especially those in \nthe  more  arid  regions.  In  some  districts  of  Punjab,  the  barani  crop  has  failed  for  3  years  in  a \nrow, resulting in forced migration to urban areas, serious indebtedness, and the impoverishment \nof  many  families  that  had  previously  enjoyed  incomes  above  the  poverty  line.  Fortunately  a \nsignificant amount of family incomes in the barani areas has traditionally come from remittances \nand this source of income has served to prevent abject famine or dire poverty. \n \n9. \nMore  optimistically,  agricultural  production  in  barani  areas  over  the  past  two  decades \nhas  shown  some  advances.  Through  public  sector  development  efforts  and  private  sector \ninitiatives, access to water has shown some improvement through small-scale irrigation, small to \nmedium  water-storage  structures,  groundwater  use,  and  water-conservation  practices.  In \naddition, access and egress from barani areas to markets and services has been improved. As \na result, in some parts of the barani areas there has also been an increase in the production of \nhigh  value  crops  such  fruit  trees  and  short-season  vegetables,  which  are  now  more  easily \nmarketed  in  nearby  urban  areas.  The  future  for  barani  agriculture  is  thus  not  entirely  bleak. \nHowever,  production  will  always  be  precarious as  long  as  water  is  in  short  supply  and  rainfall \nuncertain.  Since  there  is  no  way  that  all  barani  lands  can  be  covered  by  small-scale  or \ngroundwater irrigation, the risks of barani farming will always be higher than for farming within \nthe irrigated command areas. \n \nC. \n \nThe Economic Advisory Board of the Ministry of Finance prepared an Economic Revival \n10. \nProgram  in  2001  in  which  it  was  recognized  that  increasing  growth  in  agriculture  will  assure \nsignificant  poverty  alleviation  in  rural  areas.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture  and \nLivestock (MINFAL) has prepared a paper entitled \u201dAgriculture Strategies for the First Decade of \nthe  New  Millennium,\u201d  which  recognizes  that  agricultural  production  has  stagnated  and  is  no \nlonger  keeping  pace  with  population  growth.  In  response,  the  strategy  paper  sets  goals  of \nachieving  an  annual  production  rate  of  5%  and  achieving  food  security  and  self-reliance  by \n\nGovernment Plans and Policies \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1         23  \n\n2010. The most recent (initiated in December 2003) articulation of the strategy was reflected in \nthe  Punjab  Economic  Report  prepared  by  the  government  of  Punjab  with  assistance  from  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank,  and  Department  for  International  Development. \nThe  objective  of  the  report  is  to  provide  an  analytical  and  policy  underpinning  for  Punjab\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  overriding  concern  is  to  provide  a  better  life  for  the  province\u2019s \ncitizens. In the short to medium term, the provision of this better life depends essentially on two \nconsiderations. First, incomes must be increased; second, the delivery of public services must \nbe  improved.  It  is  recognized  that  agriculture  is  a  major  contributor  to  Punjab\u2019s  economy, \naccounting  for  roughly  28%  of  its  output  and  providing  direct  employment  to  over  40%  of  the \nworkforce.  While  total  employment  in  agriculture  has  stagnated  during  the  past  decade,  more \nefficient  utilization  of  Punjab\u2019s  public  resources  and  abundant  natural  endowments,  in \ncombination  with  measures  to  promote  agricultural  diversification  away  from  cereal  crops  to \nother  more  labor-intensive  activities,  can  help  unlock  this  sector\u2019s  tremendous  employment-\ngeneration potential. Allocation of public resources to and within the sector is one of the major \nways  that  the  government  of  Punjab  can  influence  growth  and  employment  generation  in \nagriculture. In order to reverse the decline in total public expenditures in agriculture as well as \nimprove  the  composition  of  public  spending  in  this  sector,  the  report,  among  other  things, \nrecommends  that  the  provincial  government  should  increase  public  investment,  particularly  on \nwater  management  and  research;  rationalize  public  spending  on  agriculture  support  services; \nfocus on pedigree registration systems, capacity building, and strengthening of private breeder \nassociations,  as  well  as  control  of  livestock  disease  epidemics;  and  improve  cost  recovery,  in \nconjunction with devolution to user associations. The report recommends a sustained focus on \nintegrated pest management in view of the environmental and health problems associated with \nthe high levels of pesticides used. \n \n11. \nOther aspects covered relate to rationalizing the wheat procurement and storage policy, \nmodernizing wholesale markets, and improving functioning of land and water markets. Finally, \nthe  report  reinforces  the  view  that  a  strong  agricultural  innovation  system  is  critical  to \nmodernizing agriculture, as a large part of future productivity gains and of quality enhancement. \nDiversification  must  be  provided  through  generation,  adaptation,  and  dissemination  of  new \ntechnologies  and  information.  The  report  recommends  establishment  by  the  Government  of  a \ncompetitive  fund  to  support  high  priority  research,  providing  operating  costs  to  research  by \nallocation on a competitive basis. The report recognizes that in translating these into reality, an \nimportant  challenge  in  view  of  recent  devolution  and  past  performance  will  be  to  tackle  the \ncapacity and institutional constraints.  \n \nTo specifically address issues in the barani areas of Punjab, a ministerial committee was \n12. \nconstituted  by  Punjab\u2019s  chief  minister  in  March  2004,  and  measures  are  being  identified  to \nenhance  agricultural  productivity  and  improve  livelihoods  in  the  barani  areas  to  address  the \nspecific needs of the diverse agro-ecological zones in the barani areas of Punjab. In support of \nthese needs-based initiatives, a series of interventions are being made to introduce participatory \napproaches in crop production, with a focus on quality seed and improved varieties, access to \nbetter  quality  animal-breeding  stock,  improved  management  of  rangelands,  water  resource \ndevelopment, and infrastructure.   \n  \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  focus  of  the  current  country  strategy  and  program  is  on  supporting  poverty \nalleviation  through  provision  of  assistance  in  the  key  economic  areas  of  good  governance, \nsustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  Under  good \ngovernance the country strategy and program emphasizes successful implementation of recent \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy \n\n \n\n\f24          Appendix 1 \n\nLessons Learned \n\ngovernance  reforms,  especially  devolution  of  powers  to  local  governments.  ADB  is  actively \ninvolved in this effort through its support for the Decentralization Support Program.2  \n \n14.   With specific respect to agriculture and rural development, ADB strategy aims at increased \nagricultural  growth  rates  and  enhanced  exports  of  agricultural  commodities,  leading  to  a \nreduction  in  the  proportion  of  the  rural  population  living  in  absolute  poverty  being  reduced  by \none half through rapid income growth and a reduction in food and human poverty. This is to be \nachieved  through  the  support  of  a  series  of  rural  development,  livelihood  enhancement,  water \nsector  projects  and  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development  investments  targeted  at  the \npoorer  areas  of  the  country.  Through  the  ADB  Agriculture  Sector  Program  Loan  II,3  the \nGovernment,  including  the  government  of  Punjab,  is  moving  toward  market-based  agricultural \noutput  and  has  decided  to  phase  out  price  supports  and  subsidies  while  at  the  same  time \npromoting  increased  exports,  private  competition,  and  joint  farmer  storage  and  marketing \nactivities.  Through  this  process  ADB  has  maintained  a  sustained  dialogue  with  all  the  four \nprovinces and Punjab in order to facilitate the development of consistent policy by laying out a \nframework  for  intervention  that  defines  a  tolerable  level  of  price  variability,  minimizes  fiscal \noutlays,  minimizes  distortions  to  long-run  market  equilibrium  prices,  maximizes  private  sector \nparticipation and competitive markets, and ensures that the poorest are the major beneficiaries \nof fiscal expenditures. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nOver  the  past  two  decades,  ADB  has  been  involved  in  a  number  of  rural  development \nprojects  in  Pakistan,  some  of  which  focused  on  barani  areas  and  others  which  covered  both \nbarani  and  irrigated  areas.  Most  rural  development  projects  in  the  country  have  been \nconsidered  generally  successful  in  achieving  an  improved  standard  of  living  in  the  rural  areas \nbeing  targeted.  On  the  other  hand,  most  have  also  had  some  type  of  implementation  or \nsustainability issues. \n \n16. \nExperience from past projects has repeatedly shown that a participatory, demand-driven \napproach is important for targeting the poor, providing appropriate interventions, imparting cost-\neffective  solutions,  and  ensuring  sustainability. \nthat \n(i) implementing  a  project  in  a  poor  region  does  not  have  an  automatic  impact  on  poverty \nalleviation unless specific measures are taken to target the poor; (ii) weak targeting criteria and \nnonadherence to the targeting resulted in failure to reach the poor (small farmers, landless, and \npoor  women);  (iii) lack  of  a  gender  sensitive  approach  leading  to  limited  outreach  to  women; \n(iv) inadequate extension training focused on women engaged in livestock rearing; (v) landless \npoor  women  remained  excluded  from  rural  credit;  (vi)  development  projects  were  identified  by \noutsiders  without  involvement  of  the  intended  beneficiaries;  (vii) selection  of  infrastructure \nprojects was reportedly influenced by political interests; (viii) there was inadequate attention on \nbuilding  sustainable  institutions  and  community  organizations,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  community \nownership  of  the  project.  Experience  of  other  international  financing  agencies  such  as  the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development and Department for International Development \nalso indicates that lack of poverty focus of the line agencies and the poor delivery of appropriate \nservices  to  the  resource-poor  has  also  been  a  major  issue  in  achieving  project  objectives. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program and \nTechnical Assistance Loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralization Support Program. Manila.  \n3  ADB  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nIt  has  also  been  demonstrated \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1         25  \n\nProject Interventions in Agriculture \n\nThese are in addition to the concerns relating to lack of gender awareness in service delivery, \nand  inadequate  focus  on  environmental  safeguards  and  sustainability  of  investments. \nInsufficient  focus  and  overly  complicated  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  have  also  been \nidentified in the projects financed by ADB and other development partners. If rural development \nprojects  are  to  be  responsive  they  must  be  flexible  enough  to  meet  a  range  of  beneficiary \nconcerns  and  the  management  system  should  be  decentralized  so  that  project  staff,  line \nagencies,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)/rural  support  programs  (RSPs)  can  work \nin concert in the field to respond to actual needs. Communities are generally diverse and their \nneeds  vary.  No  standard  package  can  be  designed  to  fit  all.  If  the  directions  are  set  from  the \ngrassroots and the service providers respond with a range of simple, low-cost technologies and \ninterventions,  then  the  planning  and  coordination  effort  is  minimized,  especially  if  the  project \nmanagement has a good degree of autonomy and is situated relatively close to the communities \nit  serves.  Close  collaboration  between  line  agencies  and  social  mobilizers  from  RSPs  and \nNGOs is critical if appropriate and relevant intervention packages have to be designed for the \nresource-poor communities implemented and sustained. Simplified and participatory monitoring \nand  evaluation  processes  are  critical  to  support  effective  and  institutionalized  monitoring  and \nevaluation processes.    \n \nF. \n \nThe  Project  will  work  to  strengthen  livelihood  in  agriculture  and  livestock.  Pilots  will  be \n17. \nundertaken  for  a  range  of  measures  to  be  replicated,  as  communities  deem  worthy.  In \nagriculture, the following will be prospects for farmers: improved seed supply, applied research, \nstrengthened  extension,  and  better  on-farm  water  management. \nlivestock,  breed \nimprovement, and better veterinary services and husbandry practices will be options. In natural \nresource management, rangeland and pastures development, community afforestation, and soil \nand water conservation will be possibilities for villagers. \n \nA series of interventions designed under other ongoing projects in the barani areas are \n18. \nappropriate  for  the  Project.  These  include  participatory  approaches  in  crop  production,  with  a \nfocus on quality seed and improved varieties, access to better quality breeding stock, improved \nmanagement  of  rangelands,  and  a  range  of  interventions  in  water  resource  conservation  and \ndevelopment.  Provision  has  also  been  made  to  facilitate,  on  a  competitive  basis  through  well-\narticulated  proposals,  collaboration  between  district  technical  staff  and  provincial  institutions, \nsuch  as  research  services  that  are  charged  with  development  and  validation  of  new \ninterventions.  Within  extension,  the  Project  will  attempt  to  build  on  and  replicate  successes  in \nrecent years in the National Integrated Pest Management Programme (NIPMP).4 This program \nhas inculcated integrated crop management via through farmer field schools (FFS). This is an \neco-system approach to agriculture that takes into account a broad range environmental factors \nrather than just pests, including beneficial organisms, other-plant hosts, weather, weeds, water, \nnutrients,  and  soil.  Integrated  crop  management  does  not  mean  \"no  pesticides\",  but  entails \nconsidering a range of other cultural factors before turning to expensive and potentially harmful \nagrochemicals.  The FFS approach to technology  transfer is learner-centered and differs from \ntraditional,  top-down  extension  methods.  Facilitated  farmer  learning,  rather  than  instruction,  is \nthe  focus.  The  goal  of  FFS  is  to  empower  farmers  with  knowledge,  management  skills,  and \nconfidence  so  that  they  can  ultimately  make  informed,  rational  decisions  concerning  crop \nmanagement  and  pest  control.  In  pilot  areas  in  Punjab  and  Sindh,  the  NIPMP  has  been \npopularly  accepted  and  appreciated  in  rural  communities.  The  national  and  provincial \n\nIn \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Integrated Pest Management.

Through a menu of options to be made available under the Project, village-farming \ncommunities will be active in establishing demand-driven, participatory approaches to improving \nagricultural  livelihoods.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  lasting  community  and  government \ncapacities to realize resource potential. \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n\nFunding Agencies \n\n Appendix 2            27        \n\nProject \n \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector \nDevelopment Program  \n \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector \nDevelopment Program (Project Loan) \n \nDecentralization Support Program \n \nRural Finance Sector Development Program \n(Program Loan) \n \nRural Finance Sector Development Program \n(Project Loan) \n \nSindh Rural Development Project \n \nAgriculture Sector Program Loan IIa \n \nNorth-West Frontier Province Barani Area \nDevelopment Project\u2014Phase II \nSouth FATA Development Project \n\nBajaur Area Development Project \nMohmand Area Development Project \n\nKhyber Area Development Project \n\nMalakand Rural Development Project \n\nBarani Village Development Project (Punjab) \n\nDir Area Support Project  \n\nDera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project \n\nBahawalpur Rural Development Project \n\nNorth-West Frontier Province Barani Area \nDevelopment Project \n \nMansehra Village Support Project \n\nKalam Integrated Rural Development Project, \nNWFP (Phase IV) \n\nSupport to Neelum and Jhelum Valleys \nCommunity Development Project \n \nSecond Barani Area Development (Punjab) \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n152.0 \n\nApproval \nYear \n2003 \n\n18.0 \n\n2003 \n\n205 \n\n225.0 \n\n2002 \n\n2002 \n\n25.0 \n\n2002 \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n \nADB \n\nNAS \nNAS \n \nNAS \n \nADB \n\nIFAD  \n\nIFAD  \n\nADB \n\nADB, IFAD \n \nIFAD  \n\nADB, Islamic \nDevelopment Bank \n \nADB \n\nIFAD  \n\nSwiss Agency for \nDevelopment \nCooperation \n \nIFAD \n\n50.0 \n \n350.0 \n\n52.0 \n\n17.0 \n\n4.0 \n \n\n \n\n41.0 \n\n15.3 \n\n13.0 \n\n36.0 \n\n45.0 \n\n14.5 \n\n3.5 \n\n2002 \n \n2001 \n\n2000 \n\n2000 \n \n2000 \n2000 \n\n2000 \n\n1999 \n \n1999 \n \n1997 \n \n1997 \n \n1996 \n\n1992 \n \n1992 \n\n1990 \n \n1990 \n\n32.8 \n\n1992 \n\n5.8 \n\n1991 \n\nADB \n\n25.0 \n\nSupport For the Rural Population in Chitral \nDistrict \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FATA  =  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas,  IFAD  =  International  Fund \nfor  Agricultural  Development,  NAS  =  Narcotics  Affairs  Section  of  the  United  States  Embassy,  NWFP  = \nNorth-West Frontier Province. \na  Loan 1877\u2014$123.0 million; Loan 1878\u2014$225.00 million; Loan 1879\u2014$2.0 million. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n\nEuropean Community \n\n10.1 \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\n \n \nGovernment statistics on \nagriculture productivity, \nemployment, household \nincome, expenditure surveys \n\n \n \n\n \n \nAnnual production statistics \nof the government of Punjab \n \nSpecific project benefit \nmonitoring surveys \n \n \n\n28          Appendix 3 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nA.

Agriculture contributes \nabout 23.3% of gross domestic product and provides direct employment to 42% of the workforce. Poverty in Pakistan \nhas a significant rural dimension linked closely to the economic health of the agriculture sector. The number of poor1 in \nPakistan more than doubled in the 1990s as poverty levels  increased  with the number of poor rising to 45 million in \n1999,  of  whom  33 million  or  73%  (4.7 million  households)  are  estimated  to  live  in  rural  areas.  Moreover,  Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: infant mortality in rural areas is 83 per 1,000 live births; malnutrition of children \nunder 5 is 38%. \nAn  important  feature  of  poverty  in  Pakistan  is  the  clustering  of  incomes  around  the  poverty  line,  as  40.5%  of  the \nnation\u2019s population was in a narrow income range around this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may \nbe  classed  as  chronically  or  extremely  poor.  According  to  a  Social  Policy  Development  Centre  assessment,  in  the \n1990s, over a 10-year period the disposable income of the top income quintile grow in real terms by 23%, while that of \nthe lowest quintile grew by 3%, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor.2 Factors that affect the livelihood of \nthe  poor  include  (i) low  literacy;  (ii) lack  of  access  to  appropriate  technologies,  government  extension  services,  off-\nfarm  employment  opportunities,  and  formal  credit;  (iii) social  exclusion;  (iv) gender  discrimination;  (v) exclusion  from \nthe benefits of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery. \n\n  No \n\nThe Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a poverty partnership agreement \n(PPA) that captures the key priorities for poverty alleviation. The need to target the poor to reduce inequalities as well \nas  improvement  in  agriculture  and  rural  development  are  important  components  of  the  PPA.  The  long-term  poverty \nalleviation strategy interventions are focused on governance reforms to promote efficient, equitable, and accountable \nuse  of  resources;  and  agriculture  and  rural  development  programs  to  increase  productivity,  diversification,  and \nsustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  particularly  water  and  cultivable  land.  Past  development  project  experiences3 \nhave  shown  that  lack  of  resources,  lack  of  participation  of  poor  households  and  local  communities  in  designing \ndevelopment  projects, \ninadequate  human  development  effort,  and \nmismanagement and other governance issues resulted in poor service delivery. Participation of various stakeholders \nincluding local communities, poor, government agencies, civil society, and good governance at the grassroots level is \ncritical for any poverty alleviation program.  \n\ntargeting  of  beneficiaries, \n\ninappropriate \n\nIn Punjab 36.3% of the rural population lives below the poverty line. These high levels of poverty in rural areas tie in \nclosely  with particularly low growth rates in the agriculture  sector over the past decade.  Growth  in agricultural gross \ndomestic product has been below 5% for most of the 1990s and due to a prolonged and serious drought dropped into \nnegative  figures  in  2001  and  2002.  The  unirrigated  barani  areas  suffered  much  more  severely  as  a  result  of  the \ndrought  than  the  canal-irrigated  areas.  Poor  yields  or  complete  crop  failures  forced  many  farmers  into  debt  and  to \nabandon their lands during this period. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to PRs750 per month in 2002.

Poverty Analysis                                                              Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention \nPoverty in the barani areas is exacerbated by small landholdings,4erratic rainfall patterns, and limited opportunities for \noff-farm  income;  the  main  sources  of  income  are  agriculture,  livestock,  and  daily  wages.  Agriculture  is  the  most \nwidespread  source  of  income  (61%)  in  the  project  districts.5  The  Pakistan  Integrated  Household  Survey  [  2001\u201302] \ndata indicates that the poorer districts are more dependent on agricultural income than the relatively well-off districts. \nCash income is supplemented through daily wages and livestock (over 70% households owned livestock). The project \ndistricts are ranked according to their poverty levels based on a number of economic and social indicators including \nagriculture, services, education, health, roads and transport, housing, and sewerage. Data on level of poverty in the \nproject  area  indicate  that  8%  of  the  respondents  were  very  poor,  32%  poor,  and  25%  lower-middle-income  group. \nFarm sizes are small across the project area. Farm size less than 1 hectare (ha) is considered below subsistence level \nin  the  barani  area  and  39.8%  households  own  less  than  1  ha  of  land.  The  average  income  of  a  livestock  rearer  is \nPRs2, 100 per month, which is half of the monthly average income of a household in the project area. The educational \nstatus of the households is very low. The 1998 population census data indicate that 48.9% of the rural population of 5 \nyears and above had never attended school. \n\nThe monthly income levels in the project area varies substantially between districts, but even for the most developed \ngroup\u2014  Gujrat,  Jhelum,  Rawalpindi,  and  Sialkot\u2014it  is  only  PRs6,510  whereas  for  the  least  developed  districts\u2014\nBhakkar, Chakwal, Khushab, Layyah, and Mianwali\u2014it is PRs4,795.6 The average monthly income of the household \nwas PRs5,954 in 2001/02. According to the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey data, the poorest rural households \nacross the project area had only between 40% and 55% of average incomes.  \n\nIn sum, some of the main reasons for poverty in the barani area include small landholdings, significant landlessness, \ninadequate rainfall, low crop yields and natural resource degradation. Periods of drought are a major risk to pastoral \nand agricultural livelihood and a source of vulnerability for the poor, particularly in the southern districts. The poor and \nexcluded  of  barani  Punjab,  like  many  elsewhere,  are  characterized  by  conditions  of  low  food  security  and  nutrition, \npoor  access  to  goods,  services,  skills,  knowledge,  and  productive  resources\u2014particularly  water\u2014and  a  low \nawareness of their rights and the ability to exercise those rights.  \n\nPrevious public development investment in the barani areas, through several projects in the past decades, have not \nbeen  able  to  have  a  meaningful  impact  on  the  poor  small  farmers/herders,  the  landless  and  women.  These \ninvestments  may  have  even  contributed  to  asset  inequalities  generated  by  the  ability  of  the  local  elite  to  influence \npublic expenditure.    \nThe project goal is to improve social and economic well-being of the population in the barani areas. Specifically, the \nProject  is  aimed  at  improving  the  livelihood  system  of  the  poor  households  in  the  project  area  with  emphasis  on \nwomen  and  the  vulnerable  segments  of  the  rural  population.  The  main  sectors  that  need  support  are  agriculture, \nlivestock,  natural  resource  management,  and  physical  infrastructure  development  at  the  village  level.  The  project \napproach  will  include  linkages  and  partnerships  among  the  main  stakeholders,  the  village  communities,  including \nwomen,  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable,  professionals  from  the  district  government  service  delivery  departments,  and \nlocal government representatives to develop good governance at the grassroots level. It is expected that the Project \nwill  help  improve  farming  systems,  support  services  for  agriculture  and  livestock,  rural  infrastructure,  and  increased \nnonfarm income generation for the poor. Promotion of good governance through the mobilization and capacity building \nof the community-based organizations  would create local  ownership  of the  project activities, transparency  in service \ndelivery,  and  accountability  of  government  agencies.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  alleviation  in  the  barani \nareas of Punjab through promotion of good governance, building of social capital of women and the poor, increased \nproductivity  in  agriculture  and  livestock,  improved  rural  infrastructure,  improved  natural  resource  management,  and \nincreased income generation opportunities for small farmers, women, and the landless. \n\n                                                 \n4  Approximately 60% of all farms in the area are below subsidence (2 ha) in size.  \n5  Source: Project preparatory technical assistance survey, April 2004. \n6  Computed  from  Pakistan  Integrated  Household  Survey,  2001\u201302.

Local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  well  as \nprovincial and national rural support programs (RSPs) will conduct a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) with the local \ncommunities and poor households for each of the project components to assess the situation, and identify the target \npopulation and planning of activities. More specifically, the PRA will identify the need for special approaches required \nfor active participation of women and marginalized groups, including the poorest of the poor. Need assessment will be \ndone in the area of faming, livestock, natural resources management, rural access roads, and nonfarm activities. The \nconstraints faced by rural poor in their livelihood system will be one of the major focuses of the need assessment. The \nPRA  will  include  men  and  women  stakeholders  from  the  communities.  Specific  effort  will  be  taken  to  ensure \nparticipation of poor men and women in the process. Base line survey will be conducted for the targeted households to \nmeasure the impact of the Project at the end of the project cycle. Participatory and transparent planning processes will \nbe  introduced  in  the  Project  and  the  stakeholders  will  be  provided  with  training  in  participatory  development.  The \nselected NGOs and the RSPs be involved in facilitating the processes.  \n\nLocal NGOs and RSPs will be involved in: (i) identifying the target villages according to the proposed targeting criteria; \n(ii) coordinating between the project and the community based organizations/citizen community boards (CBOs/CCBs) \n(iii) identifying  and  strengthening  existing  CBOs/CCBs  through  targeted  capacity  building  measures;  (iv) mobilizing \nand  supporting  the  existing  and  new  partner  CBOs/CCBs  and  sensitizing  them  to  social  issues,  regarding  women, \nchildren,  labor  and  human  rights,  as  well  as  providing  organizational  and  management  support  and  providing \ninformation  and  exposure  on  project  initiatives  and  opportunities;  and  (v) assisting  CBOs  to  pursue  registration  as \nCCBs for securing annual development funding. \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn  the  rural  economy,  women  are  working  alongside  men  as  equal  partners  and  contributors  in  productive  sectors \n(agriculture and livestock) but their contribution is not fully reflected in Government statistics. Women not only manage \nthe household chores (cooking and washing, sewing, cleaning the house, bearing and rearing children, etc.) but also \ncollect water and fuel wood, cut fodder, and actively participate in other agricultural and livestock activities. \n \nAccording  to  the  population  census  1998  and  the  labor  force  surveys,  there  seems  to  be  an  underestimation  of  the \nfemale labor force participation rate. For instance, in the project districts, almost 95% of the females of 10 years and \nabove were classified as household workers by the population census 1998, hence they were not considered a part of \nthe labor force. The census data show that 53% of males and only 2.1% of females of the working age cohort (10+) \nare economically active. \n \nHowever, the agriculture census 2000 reaffirms that women add to economic productivity especially in the agriculture \nand livestock sectors, e.g., in the Bhakkar district, 27% of the full-time and 51% of the part-time workers involved in \nagriculture  are  women.  Similarly,  44.5%  of  the  full-time  and  52%  of  the  part-time  workers  involved  in  livestock \nactivities  are  women.  These  data  are  further  substantiated  by  focus  group  discussions  and  in-depth  interviews \nconducted  during  the  poverty  assessment  and  livelihood  analysis  in  the  project  area.  The  livelihood  study  data  also \nreveal  that  in  poorer  families,  women  are  more  active  in  economic  activities.  There  are  variations  in  female  labor \nactivities according to districts and distinct sociocultural conditions in various areas. In the northern belt, women are \nconstrained to activities (livestock or related) within their family compounds.  \n \nUnder the new local government system, participation of women has been ensured by allocating 33% of the seats in \nthe  elected  local  governments  (zila  council,  tehsil  council,  and  union  council)  to  women.  To  improve  their  active \nparticipation in governance, training (as members of the council, and monitoring committees has been identified and \nrecommended by the Project.  \n \nThe  design  features  of  the  Project  include  the  following  measures  to  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  various \nactivities  of  the  Project  especially  under  the  targeted  poverty  alleviation  and  literacy  through  skills  training \ndevelopment components. During implementation, through the gender action plan, mechanisms will be developed and \nrefined for active involvement of  women in project activities and for providing specific benefits of the Project to poor \nwomen.  \n \nSocial Mobilization/Group Formation: The RSPs will be involved in strengthening the existing CBOs/CCBs and in \nmobilization  and  outreach  activities  to  facilitate  women\u2019s  group  formation  and/or  establishing  women\u2019s  CCBs  at  the \nvillage  level  or  neighborhood  level  as  relevant.  The  group/CCBs  will be  the  entry  point  of  project  interventions  for \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8          41 \n\nvarious  project  activities.  Group  formation/CCB  formation  will  be  carried  out  for  male  groups  also.  Mobilization \nactivities will be designed to form 40\u201350% of female groups/CCBs.  \n  \nAgriculture:  Women  members  of  the  groups/CCBs  will  be  involved  in  the  training/extension  program  of  crop  and \nvegetable  demonstration  plots,  activities  related  to  village  seed  bank  and  seed  grader,  improving  the  lining  of \nwatercourses, farmer field schools, and field research activities. \n \nLivestock:  Women  members  of  the  groups/CCBs  will  be  provided  with  the  livestock  extension  services.  Targeting \npoor women for village veterinary workers will create employment and income earning opportunities for women from \nthe poor households. Women from the livestock rearing and farm households will be included in the training/extension \nof fodder and feed supplement demonstration and conservation plots. Women are the primary target beneficiaries for \nactivities related to household energy needs, and preparation of organic fertilizer and biogas plants.  \n  \nManagement of Natural Resources: Activities related to development of agriculture, pastoral land, soil conservation, \nwater  resource  management,  and  women\u2019s  groups/CCBs  should  be  actively  involved  in  training/extension/ \ndemonstration and relevant activities. The RSPs will facilitate the involvement of women\u2019s groups/CCBs.  \n \nRural Access Roads: Women\u2019s groups/CCBs will be part of the consultation for planning of rural access roads. The \nlocation  of  rural  roads  has  an  impact  on  women\u2019s  daily  household  activities,  farm  activities  and  access  to  markets, \nhealth services, and education facilities.  \n \nOff-Farm Activities: Half of the targeted beneficiaries of the off-farm income earning activities and skills training will \nbe  women.  Off  farm-activities  could  be  developed  in  traditional  crafts.  Women  artisans  from  the  villages  should  be \ntargeted for linkages with microfinance institutions for small-scale microenterprise development. \n \nLiteracy Through Skills Training: One component of the project is specifically designed for  women. Provision has \nbeen  made  for  the  literacy  training  of  about  20,000  rural  women  from  poor  households  through  special  courses \nfocused on imparting livelihood and household skills. In order to provide an incentive for women to participate in the \ntraining program the skills courses will be linked to potential credit provision through the project RSPs for women who \nsuccessfully complete the training modules. \n \nLinkages  Between  Women\u2019s  Groups/CCBs  and  Government  Agencies:  The  RSPs  will  facilitate  the  women\u2019s \ngroups/CCBs in order for the women\u2019s group/CCBs for participating in planning and implementing project activities. \n \nCapacity  Building  and  Institutional  Development:  Capacity  building  of  the  relevant  government  agencies  will \ninclude  support  to  the  gender  reform  action  plan  under  Decentralization  Support  Program.  In  addition,  the  capacity \nbuilding program  will target men and  women elected representatives  of the relevant local government. The capacity \nbuilding  training  modules  prepared  under  RETA:  Gender  and  Governance  Issues  in  Local  Government7  for  elected \nrepresentatives  of  the  local  government  should  be  used  (strengthened  as  relevant)  for  the  training  of  the  elected \nrepresentatives.  The  institutional  capacity  and  capacity  building  of  the  staff  of  the  district  administration  will  include \ngender  sensitization  training  and  planning  exercise  with  rural  women  and  the  poor.  Women  staff  of  the  relevant \ngovernment offices will be included in the capacity building, awareness, and training program. \n \nMonitoring Indicators: A gender-disaggregated database will be included in the project benefit monitoring system to \nmonitor  the  number  of  men  and  women  beneficiaries  targeted  and  achievement  of  the  target  in  each  of  the  above \nproject activities. The database will be disaggregated by socioeconomic characteristics of the households to measure \nthe  involvement  of  men  and  women  from  the  poor  households  and  vulnerable  groups.  Community  monitoring  and \nevaluation will ensure that the targeting criteria are being followed and the project benefits reach the poor. \n \nGender and Development Support: The consulting service package includes a provision for (i) a foreign consultant \nsocial  impact  specialist  to  address  all  social  issues,  including  gender;  (ii) a  domestic  consultant  consulting \norganization/gender  specialist  to  work  over  the  first  4  years  of  the  Project  to  ensure  that  gender  concerns  are \naddressed;  and  (iii) three  full-time  social  impact/gender  specialists  assigned  to  the  Project  Management  Units  \nthroughout  the  full  duration  of  the  project  to  ensure  that  social  and  gender  concerns  are  adequately  addressed  and \nincorporated in a gender action plan. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.

As such the environmental \nimpacts  of  each  subproject  or  the  overall  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  cannot  be \nassessed  during  the  design  stage.  Instead,  the  Project  design  includes  a  detailed  document \noutlining  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  (EARP)  to  be  followed  during \nimplementation  (Supplementary  Appendix to \nthe \nPresident). The EARP report describes a set of subproject selection criteria, which at the outset \neliminate  any  subprojects  that  may  warrant  an  environmental  impact  assessment  level  of \nanalysis.  Procedures  are  outlined  for  subprojects  that  require  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  level  of  analysis,  and  for  those  that  do  not  require  any  environmental \nassessment, a general set of environmental guidelines is proposed.  \n\nthe  Report  and  Recommendation  of \n\nA typical subproject that requires an IEE1 was selected and subjected to the IEE process \n2. \ndescribed in the EARP report. This will serve as a model IEE, and form the basis for future IEEs \nto be undertaken for subprojects to be implemented under the Project. The full IEE report is an \nattachment to the EARP report and the summary IEE is presented below.  \n\nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n3. \nThis  IEE  report  investigates  the  environmental  impacts  of  a  rural  access  road  in  \nHaiderababad  union  council  in  Mankera  tehsil,  in  Bhakkar  district.  The  route  originates  in  the \nvillage  of  Shah  Sayed  Ali  up  to  the  village  of  Bhidwalwala,  through  the  villages  of  Toperi, \nDarbula, and Sarwarwala. The total length of the surveyed access route is 20.5 kilometers. The \nselected route already exists as a jeepable dirt track connecting the five villages.  \n\nConstruction  methodologies  and  specifications2  already  in  practice  by  the  district  road \n4. \ndepartment  under  the  funding  of  Asian  Development  Bank  will  be  followed  by  the  Project. \nApproved  stone  quarries  will  be  used  to  source  material  for  subbase  and  base  formation. \nBitumen material will be used as surface sealant.  \n\n5. \nThe  works  and  services  department  will  hire  local  residents  of  the  five  villages  that  lie \nalong  the  access  route  in  the  construction  of  the  road  wherever  unskilled  labor  is  to  be \nemployed. A basic construction camp will be set up in an existing land clearing to accommodate \nany heavy equipment and laborers not belonging to the villages along the route.  \n\n                                                 \n1  As  per  the  Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Act  1997  and  the  Pakistan  Initial  Environmental  Examination  and \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Review Regulations 2000. \n\n2  The  specifications  and  procedures  to  be  employed  are  standard  of  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway \nand Transportation Official or the American Society for Testing and Material as indicated in their latest editions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44          Appendix 9 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1.  Physical Environment \n\nThe project area is located in the desert zone, which spreads over a vast expanse in the \n6. \ndistricts of Bhakkar and Layyah. The project area is located at the eastern edge of the desert \nzone, close to the district boundary between Bhakkar and Jhang. As such the area constitutes a \ntypical sand dune desert with very little vegetation. The climate of the area is hot and arid. The \naverage  rainfall  is  less  than  240 millimeters  (mm)  per  annum,  with  the  lowest  at  180 mm  per \nannum. The temperatures could rise to around 50\u00b0C during the summer months but could drop \nbelow  freezing  point  in  the  winter  and  at  night.  The  area  is  characterized  by  high  winds \nthroughout the year, subjecting the area to dust storms.  \n\n7. \nThe  only  water  available  to  the  project  area  is  groundwater  that  is  accessible  either \nthrough  dug  wells  or  deeper  tube  wells.  Local  residents  reported  that  sweet  groundwater  was \nbeing accessed at less than 30 meters and 90% of the households have hand pumps or electric \nmotors.  When watered, sandy soil of the dunes can support a variety of crops since the soil is \nrich in nutrients. Farmers have channelized groundwater from tube wells for irrigation purposes \nwherever possible. \n\n2.  Biological Environment \n\n8. \nThe  project  area  lies  close  to  the  edge  of  the  Thal  Game  Reserve,  a  nationally \ndesignated protected area. The area is visited by many migratory bird species the great Indian \nBustard  (Ardeotis  Nigriceps),  the  Houbara  Bustard  (Chlamydotis  Undulata),  and  Sand  Grouse \n(Pteroclididae). The Thal Game Reserve is most well known for the Houbara Bustard, which is \nsubject to sport hunting. Mammals include the Chinkara Gazelle (Gazella Gazella) and Desert \nFox (Vulpes Bengarlenisis). The Chinkara is close to extinction due to habitat depletion. Lizards \n(Valetes Varisceler) are also found in this desert ecosystem. The vegetation found in the Thal \ndesert consists of grasses, shrubs and trees (Prosopis, Juliflora, Prosopis, Ceneria, Acacia Sps. \nare common species)  that require little water and can survive in the harsh temperatures of the \narea.  \n\n3.  Socioeconomic Environment \n\n9. \nThe  population  of  the  villages  are  as  follows:  Shah  Syed  Ali\u20146,000,  Darbula\u20141,800, \nToperi\u20142,500, and Bhidwalwala\u20142,400. The total landholdings of the villages varies between \n31,280  acres  in  Darbula,  approximately  375  acres  in  Sarwarwala,  3,750  acres  in  Toperi,  and \n1,250  acres  in  Bhidwalwala.  The  project  area  lies  across  three  rakhs  (i.e.,  community  range \nlands):  rakh  Dhingana,  rakh  Haiderabad,  and  rakh  Mankera.  Most  lands  in  these  rakhs  have \nbeen allotted to local residents for cultivation purposes. \n\n10. \nAgriculture is the main source of income in the project area, supplemented by livestock. \nGram  is  the  only  crop  grown  in  the  area.  Small  local  businesses  and  daily  wageworkers  form \nthe other two brackets of occupations.  \n\n11. \nThe villages of Darbula, Shah Sayed Ali, and Sarwarwala are connected to the national \ngrid. The project area is not linked to the nationwide telephone line, though many residents own \ncellular phones, and there are some public call offices in the area. The village of Toperi has a \nprimary school, Bhidwalwala has a middle school, and Darbula, has a boys\u2019 high school. Qadir \nEducation Foundation, a local nongovernment organization, has set up girls\u2019 primary schools at \nDarbula and Toperi and a girls' vocational school. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9          45      \n\n4. \n\nCultural and Archaeological Sites \n\n12. \nNo  archaeological  sites  were  reported  or  sighted  in  the  area  of  the  three  villages  or \nalong  or  in  proximity  to  selected  road.  However,  there  are  many  shrines  or  ziarats  (graves  of \nreligious  scholars  and  saints)  in  the  area.  Local  pilgrims  revere  these  sites  and  visit  them \nregularly.  Additionally  there  are  graveyards  and  mosques  associated  with  the  villages.  There \nare  three  ziarats  in  the  area  that  are  regularly  visited  by  pilgrims.  Two  of  these  ziarats  are \nlocated  in  Shah  Saiyed  Ali  village  (Pir  Saiyed  Ali  Shah  and  Pir  Fateh  Din)  and  one  is  near \nDarbula (Mian Allah Jawaya). \n\n5. \n\nCivil Society Organizations \n\nThe  presence  of  NGOs  in  the  project  area  is  very  limited.  Only  one  NGO,  Qadir \n\n13. \nEducation Foundation, is doing some work in the villages of Darbula and Toperi. \n\nC. \n\nImpact Assessment and Mitigation Measures \n\nAlthough  construction  of  road  links  is  likely  to  have  an  overall  positive  impact  on  the \n14. \ncondition and livelihood of the residents of the local communities, some adverse impacts may \narise  during  the  three  phases  of  the  road  construction  project:  planning,  construction,  and \nimplementation.  These  impacts  and  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the \nfollowing table. \n\nTable A9.1: Impacts and Proposed Mitigation Measures \n\nPotential Impact \n\nMitigation and Monitoring Measures \n\nImproper and inadequate surveying of trace resulting \nroad trace conflicting with existing land uses and \nexisting protected areas \n\nIncorrect road and pavement design resulting in \ninadequate drainage and premature degradation from \nexposure to extreme weather conditions \n\nNuisance to nearby communities through noise and \ndust emission and loss of privacy \n\nIncreased soil erosion at construction sites \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nProper survey of the land of the area with the assistance \nof the local land revenue officer and village residents to \navoid residential properties, private agricultural properties, \ncultural and religious sites, and protected areas \n\nConducting sound technical feasibility study based on \nassessment of soils and hydrology of the area. \n\nControl noise by limiting operating hours of heavy \nmachinery; control dust by sprinkling construction sites \nwith water; locating construction camp at least 500 meters \nfrom a community; and obtaining water for construction \nand other laborers' requirements from a deep tube well \n\nAscertain full community participation in the operation; \ncommunity to be consulted \n\nProper construction practices, adequate monitoring, \nhealth and safety trainings to all construction workers; \nand planting of drought-resistant plant species along the \nnew access track to curb any soil erosion that may arise \ndue to construction of this new road. \n\nOverexploitation of existing water resources \n\nUsing abandoned brackish water wells whenever possible \n\nA mitigation management matrix has been prepared that lists all activities likely to have \n15. \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  the  various  phases  of  the  Project  (i.e.,  design, \nconstruction, and operation) and recommends mitigation measures for these impacts along with \nthe  person/institution  responsible  for  the  mitigation  measures  and  for  monitoring,  the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46          Appendix 9 \n\n \n\nparameters  to  be  monitored,  and  the  timing  for  carrying  out  the  mitigation  or  monitoring.  This \nmatrix  will be used as a management and monitoring tool for implementation of the mitigation \nmeasures required by the IEE.  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\n16. \n\nThe environmental monitoring plan includes the following components. \n\n1.  Activity Monitoring \n\n17. \nActivity monitoring will be carried out to ensure compliance with the requirements of the \nIEE, the environmental monitoring plan will be used as a management and monitoring tool. The \ndistrict  environment  officers  and  Agency  for  Barani  Area  Development  (ABAD)  project \nenvironmental staff will regularly visit the sites for activity monitoring during construction.  \n\n2.  Effects Monitoring \n\nEffects monitoring will be the responsibility of the district environment officer and ABAD \n18. \nproject environmental staff. A detailed monitoring program will be prepared, which will cover the \nphysical,  biological,  and  socioeconomic  environment.  The  monitoring  program  will  describe  in \ndetail the resources and methodology that will be adopted for the purpose of effects monitoring. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPostproject Monitoring \n\n19. \nAfter completion of the road construction operation postproject monitoring will be carried \nout in order to determine the level of residual impacts of the Project on the environment of the \narea.  The  postproject  survey  report  will  be  submitted  to  the  Project  management  unit  and \nproject steering committee within 14 days after completion of the survey. \n\nE. \n\nBudget and Staffing Requirements \n\n20. \nThe  following  section  relates  to  budget  and  staffing  requirements  of  the  entire  Project \nand  not  just  the  Bhakkar  road  subproject.  Responsibility  for  monitoring  and  compliance  with \nnational environmental legislation and policy at the provincial level lies with the Environmental \nProtection Department, Punjab. Further, at the district level, following devolution of government \nto  the  local  level  through  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001,  a  district  officer, \nenvironment is responsible for all matters relating to the environment.  \n\n21. \nIt  has  been  agreed  with  the  Government  that  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  safeguards  proposed  under  the  Project,  three  dedicated  staff  positions  will  be \nestablished in ABAD to cover all environmental issues connected to the Project interventions.  \n\nThe  budget \n\n22. \nappointments, and other operation and maintenance costs is presented in the following table. \n\nincluding  environmental  assessments, \n\nfor  environmental \n\ninputs \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9          47      \n\nTable A9.2: Budget for Environmental Inputs \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \n  Costs \n\n \n  \n\n \n  \n\n \nUnit \n\n \nTotal \n \n\n \n\n(Local \n'000) \n\n($ \n'000) \n\nTotal \n($'000)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nA.

More than 60 people attended the consultation meeting at \nDarbula  village  after  an  agreement  deed  as  signed  between  by  the  villagers  confirming  their \nconsent to constructing a road through the area. All the people present unanimously agreed to \nthe proposed track without conditionalities and pledged to provide their wholehearted support to \nthe Project. Similarly, discussions and verbal pledges were also taken from the local councilors \nIllahi Baksh and Muhammad Amin. Muhammad Naseem, the village nambardar,3 also took part \nin  this  discussion.  Like  Darbula,  people  showed  up  in  great  numbers  to  attend  the  public \nconsultation meeting\u2014approximately 50 people attended. The people entertained the idea of a \nroad to their village. However, some did not immediately understand the importance of a bypass \naround  the  community.  However,  after  detailed  discussion  they  understood,  and  agreed  to \nhaving  the  road  connect  their  village  to  the  main  road,  and  to  a  bypass.  A  community \nconsultation  meeting  was  arranged  at  Sarwarwala  a  large  number  of  people  (10\u201315)  were \npresent  in  the  primary  school  building  of  the  village.  This  is  the  most  backward  village  in  the \narea and people took great interest in the discussion. Along with the inhabitants of Sarwarwala, \nelders of the nearby small hamlets also attended. All local residents shared the opinion that the \nproposed  route  should  not  pass  through  the  middle  of  their  village,  an  agreement  deed  was \nsigned  after  mutual  agreement.  A  public  meeting  was  conducted  in  Bhidalwala,  all  local \nresidents  (5\u201310  people)  appreciated  the  idea  of  a  metaled  road  from  Bhidwalwala  to  Shah \n\n                                                 \n3  An  honorary  position  held  by  a  village  notable,  selected  by  the  government.  The  nambardar  oversees  all  land \nrelated transactions, collects the actual land revenue (maaliya), and has the authority to attest property and other \ndocuments. He also has the main responsibility of identifying the actual landowner when a transaction is to take \nplace. This position is to some extent hereditary. It was institutionalized during the British era, following from the \nMogul period. \n\n \n\n\f48          Appendix 9 \n\n \n\nSayyed  Ali,  as  it  would  provide  unhindered  access  for  them  to  the  local  produce  market  at \nHyderabad and the dal (gram pulse) factory at Shah Sayyed Ali. The village of Shah Sayyed Ali \nlies at the beginning of the access track, and is already connected to the Bhakkar-Jhang road. \nHowever,  since  land  along  the  access  track  is  owned  by  the  residents  of  the  village  their \nconsent  was  sought  through  a  consultation  meeting.  These  landowners  (five  in  number) \npledged full support to the proposed track.  \n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n24. \nThe  IEE  finds  that  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  building  a  farm-to-market \naccess  road  between  Shah  Sayed  Ali  and  Bhidwalwala,  union  council  Haiderabad,  tehsil \nMankera,  district  Bhakkar  are  likely.  The  communities  that  lie  in  the  area  along  the  selected \naccess route will benefit from such a development activity and it will serve to improve the quality \nof  life  of  the  people  of  the  areas.  Some  minor  impacts  relating  to  construction  may  be  likely; \nhowever,  the  incorporation  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures  recommended  through  the  IEE \nwill mitigate or altogether remove these impacts. \n\nH. \n\nConclusions \n\n25. \nabove is required. \n\nThe IEE concludes that no detailed environmental impact assessment for the subproject \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          49 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nProject Justification \n\nApproach and Methodology \n\n \nA. \n \nThe project interventions pursue both efficiency and equity objectives. The need for the \n1. \nProject arises from the prevalent high poverty incidence, unemployment, poor organization and \nsuboptimal  use  of  factors  of  production,  and  poor  delivery  of  social  and  economic  services. \nMoreover,  lack  of  adequate  investment  in  physical,  productive,  and  social  infrastructure  and \ninefficient delivery mechanisms has inhibited the economic growth of rural areas in general, and \nin barani areas in particular.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAs  the  Project  will  follow  a  process  approach,  it  allows  for  support  of  a  variety  of \ninterventions as identified by the beneficiaries. The present analysis is based on assessment of \nindicative  model  budgets  of  potential  interventions.  The  representative  models  have  been \nanalyzed for quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs and benefits, impact on household income \nand poverty, economic viability, and distribution of the project benefits. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nFor purposes of presentation, the analysis has been broken down by the major project \ncomponents. For component 1 (village and union development), medium-scale infrastructure is \nenvisioned,  at  a  minimum  cost  of  $25,000  (and  maximum  of  $150,000).  For  component  2 \n(targeted  poverty  alleviation),  smaller-scale  activities  at  the  village  and  community  levels  are \nexpected,  with  most  in  the  range  of  $2,000\u201310,000.  In  fact,  the  divisions  are  not  totally \nexclusive.  Some  types  of  subprojects  will  extend  into  both  ranges  depending  on  the  scale  of \nactivity  or  whether  several  subprojects  of  a  similar  nature  are  bundled  to  meet  the  higher \nthreshold. \n \n \n \n4. \nTable  A10.1  summarizes  project  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs),  sensitivity, \nand switching values for the sample subprojects. The presentation demonstrates that there are \nviable technologies that the Project can facilitate and that these will contribute to the betterment \nof the population residing in barani areas. The subproject EIRRs range from 13% to 36%, with \nmost clustering near 20%, or higher.  \n \n5. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken by subjecting the subprojects to (i) cost increases of \n10%,  (ii) benefit  decreases  of  10%,  and  (iii) both.  (The  results  are  summarized  in  the  table.) \nOnly one subproject, the dug well (salt range) appears vulnerable to such variation in the cost \nand benefit parameters. Its EIRR drops to as low as 10.1% if both costs increase and benefits \ndecrease by 10%. However, since water is so highly valued in these dry areas, that may still be \nacceptable  for  those  inhabitants.  All  13  other  interventions  remain  economic  under  those \nrestrictive  sensitivity  conditions.  Lastly,  switching  values  for  cost  increases  and  benefit \ndecreases are provided in the table, and, again, the figures demonstrate the economic stability \nof the models. \n \n\nEconomic Summary \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f50          Appendix 10 \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\nD. \n \n6. \nFinancial analysis, based on the subproject models, suggests that the interventions will \nsignificantly contribute to household incomes. For this analysis, most of the financial gains have \nbeen  assessed  on  a  per  hectare  basis.  The  values  generally  range  from  PRs2,000  ($35)  to \nPRs9,000  ($150),  with  outliers  at  PRs717  ($12)  and  PRs14,200  ($240).  Notwithstanding  the \nsize of subprojects, the financial gains from most of the subprojects are modest, in terms of per \ncapita increase in income; nonetheless they are a significant addition from the low base. \n \n7. \nTable  A10.2  presents  a  summary  of  investment  costs  and  financial  internal  rates  of \nreturn  (FIRRs)  for  various  indicative  model  subprojects.  The  FIRRs  also  demonstrate  private \nparty viability and incentives to participate in the Project. \n\n \n\nOff-Farm Employment \n\nDistribution Analysis and the Poor \n\n \nE. \n \nOne of the immediate objectives of the Project is employment generation. This is to be \n8. \nachieved  through  execution  of  subprojects,  increased  demand  for  farm  labor  arising  from  the \nincreased productivity, and through literacy through training in skills development. It is expected \nthat  the  subprojects  will  require  a  significant  labor  force.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  assist \ncommunities  in  acquiring  skills  and  trades  that  will  be  demand-based.  That  should  enable \ninhabitants  to  be  gainfully  employed  within  the  project  area,  or  should  enhance  their  skills  for \nbetter  employment  outside  the  project  area.  The  stakeholders  in  field  meetings  clearly \nexpressed the need for training in various skills and trades. However, at this stage, it is difficult \nto  ascertain  the  demand  and  absorption  rate  of  trained  persons.  Per  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance estimates, it is expected that 12,000 individuals will benefit from a range of \nvocational  skills  and  enterprise  development  support  to  be  offered  under  the  Project.  On \naverage, a trained person is estimated to generate net annual incremental income of PRs6,098 \nin  the  case  of  improved  profitability  of  existing  enterprise,  and  PRs21,705  in  the  case  of  paid \nemployment. \n \nF. \n \n9. \nThough  each  subcomponent  varies  in  terms  of  distribution  of  benefits  between \nstakeholders (poor farm households with less than 1 hectare (ha) landholding, landless livestock \nmenders, unskilled landless labor), gains of most of the subprojects will mainly accrue to poor \nsegments  of  the  population,  especially  small  farmers.  It  is  estimated  that  about  70%  of  the \nbenefits from the irrigation, soil conservation, and natural resource management subprojects will \ngo to the poor farm households and landless laborers.  \n \nDistribution  and  poverty  impact  analyses  are  carried  out  for  four  sample  subprojects: \n10. \nvillage  drinking  water  supply,  jeepable  track,  pasture  and  rangeland  development,  and  village \nelectrification.  Many  of  the  villages  with  no  water  supply  or  access  to  electrification  are  more \nremote and poorer than those that have already been covered. For jeepable track, the poor are \nestimated to make up 90% of the labor supply and for road user benefits, the poor are estimated \nat two thirds of their representation in the barani population. This adjustment is made to allow \nfor disproportionate road use benefits going to vehicle owners and those who can more easily \nafford travel. For rangeland and pasture development, the poor are viewed as disproportionately \nhigh among the common land users, and are estimated as 75% of the main beneficiary group.  \nIn sum, all of these sample models suggest that project activities are well structured and likely to \nhave an impact on the poor and reduce poverty. Poverty encompasses considerably more than \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10          51      \n\njust low income. In addition to improving livelihoods, the Project provides advancement in terms \nof access to social services, social infrastructure, and literacy and skills training. \n\n \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nG. \n \n11. \nUnder the targeted poverty alleviation component, prior to undertaking any intervention, \nthe  beneficiaries  are  required,  as  a  step  in  the  systematic  approval  process,  to  (i) give  their \nformal  acknowledgement  of  the  requirements  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nsubprojects, (ii) formalize an O&M plan with delimited responsibilities, and (iii) commit resources \nto  ensure  that  the  plan  is  carried  out.  For  the  union  development  component,  the \nimplementation  of  medium-scale  infrastructure  (such  as  roads  or  rural electrification)  will  likely \nbe carried out by the line agencies. For this, official procedures are in place for O&M of public \ninfrastructure. In addition, revised commitments are being made for local governments (districts) \nunder  devolution  specifically  for  the  O&M  budget\u2014i.e.,  funds  that  are  not  to  be  reallocated. \nVillage mobilization, provided under this component, should also build awareness, support, and \ncommitment  for  O&M  in  community  groups.  Lastly,  as  a  prerequisite  to  subproject  approval, \nbeneficiaries are required to provide up-front cash\u2014funds that can be dedicated to future O&M \nrequirements.  In  addition,  an  O&M  framework  between  beneficiaries  and  public  agencies  will \nalso  be  developed  to  institutionalize  funding  and  execution  responsibilities  for  all  O&M-related \nrequirements.
