THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the additional financing of the Greater Mekong Subregion Health \nSecurity Project.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion Health \nSecurity Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The original project is assisting Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam in complying with the International Health Regulations (IHR).2 It \nis developing core health system capacities to respond to public health threats of national and \ninternational concern. Investments under the original project support three outputs: (i) regional \ncooperation and communicable disease control in border areas improved, (ii) national disease \nsurveillance  and  outbreak  response  system  strengthened,  and  (iii)  laboratory  services  and \nhospital  infection  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  improved.  A  fourth  output,  emergency \npreparedness and response capacity for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) strengthened, was \nadded to the project under the additional financing for Lao PDR and Myanmar (footnote 1). The \nproposed additional financing of the Cambodia project will help the Government of Cambodia \nrespond to the COVID-19 pandemic.3 It will (i) support laboratory services and IPC in 8 provincial \nhospitals and 73 district referral hospitals; (ii) equip 14 provincial hospitals with the means to \nprovide emergency clinical care for COVID-19 patients, including upgraded oxygen supply; and \n(iii)  strengthen surveillance  and  response  capacity  for  COVID-19  and  other  communicable \ndiseases nationwide.4  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 22 \nNovember 2016, for a total of $125 million equivalent to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and \nViet Nam (footnote 1). Additional financing of $20 million was approved for the Lao PDR on 22 \nMay 2020 and of $30 million for Myanmar on 8 October 2020 to support their emergency response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic (under an added output 4). The completion date for the original project \nis 31 March 2022, and the loan closing date is 30 September 2022. As of 31 August 2021, against \nan elapsed implementation period of 82%, the original project in Cambodia is rated on track. \nAgainst the original approved loan amount of $21.00 million, cumulative contract awards for \nCambodia are $15.38 million (73.24% of ADB financing) and $15.46 million (73.62% of ADB \nfinancing, including advances of $1.50 million). Of the 10 outcome and output indicators for \n \n1  The original project comprises (i) loans to Cambodia (SDR15,012,000 [$21 million]), the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  (SDR2,856,000  [$4 million]),  Myanmar  (SDR8,616,000  [$12  million]),  and  Viet  Nam \n(SDR56,946,000 [$80 million]); and (ii) a grant to the Lao PDR ($8 million). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprovided loans (additional financing) to the Lao PDR ($20 million) and Myanmar ($30 million). ADB also provided \nproject preparatory technical assistance of $1.3 million to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. ADB. \nGreater Mekong Subregion Health Security Project; ADB.

Output 1 is \nnot part of the additional financing project.  \n4  The project sites under the original and the additional financing are described in linked document Project Locations \n(accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "2 \nCambodia, four have already been fully achieved, and six, partially. The delivery of the expected \noutputs is rated successful. All 7 actions in the gender action plan (GAP) are being implemented; \n7 of 11 targets (64%) are on track; and 4 targets (36%) have not yet been met. Project covenants, \nincluding all safeguard covenants, are being complied with. The project implementation risks have \n \nbeen adequately mitigated, and the management of risks is rated successful. \n \n4.  Coronavirus disease context. As of 2 September 2021, Cambodia had recorded 93,510  \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19, and 1,916 deaths.5 Its early efforts to build response capacity for \nCOVID-19 were guided by the Response Plan for COVID-19 of the Ministry of Health (MOH).6 \nThis plan prioritized nine focus areas for health system strengthening geared to COVID-19 \nresponse readiness.7 Despite success in keeping confirmed COVID-19 cases low throughout \n2020, an outbreak that began on 20 February 2021 resulted in a surge of new infections and \nsustained community transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the \nrisk of silent transmission, following reports that 66% of cases linked to the outbreak were \nasymptomatic.8 Cambodia\u2019s highly mobile population is a driver of COVID-19 spread. Up to 4.1 \nmillion people per year migrate internally. Migrant workers face social and economic barriers in \naccessing health services, which increases the risk that COVID-19 cases remain undetected.9  \n \n5.  Remaining deficiencies in the health system. In 2021, MOH made the rollout of COVID-\n19 vaccination a key pillar of the country\u2019s response.10 As of 31 August 2021, Cambodia had \nadministered 18.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses (footnote 5). The rollout of vaccination is \nprimarily through provincial and district hospitals that run COVID-19 vaccination clinics. Given the \npotential for new variants of the virus to impede vaccine efficacy, continued strengthening of the \nhealth  system  to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  COVID-19  is  needed.11 Despite  marked \nimprovements in the capacity of Cambodia\u2019s health system since 2013, deficiencies remain. In \n2020, MOH assessed Cambodia\u2019s compliance with the IHR benchmarks for core health system \ncapacities as 50%.12 Cambodia scored below average on the Global Health Security Index.13 The \nCOVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to scale up successful ongoing investments in the \nhealth sector, in order to overcome remaining deficiencies in surveillance and outbreak response, \nlaboratories, IPC, and health service provision.  \n \n6.  Surveillance and response. The increase in COVID-19 cases and related community \ntransmission have overwhelmed subnational surveillance and response capabilities. Gaps in \nprovincial capabilities for data management, contact tracing, and quarantine impede efficient \noutbreak management. Rapid response teams lack appropriately trained standby staff to provide \nsurge  capacity.14 Weak  capability  for  risk  communication  hampers  community  adoption  of \nprotective practices. \n \n \n5   WHO.

Laboratory and infection prevention and control. Laboratories and IPC facilities in 8 \nprovincial hospitals and 73 district referral hospitals not supported under the original project are \nin urgent need of upgrades. Assessments found inadequate and outdated laboratory equipment \nfor diagnosis and clinical management, including for COVID-19 comorbidities. Renovation of \nlaboratory  rooms  is  required  in  62  of  these  hospitals.  Supplies  of  antigen-detecting  rapid \ndiagnostic tests for COVID-19 are insufficient to support contact tracing efforts.15 IPC equipment \nsuch as autoclaves, washing machines, and waste management systems requires replacement. \n \n8.  Emergency  preparedness.  Provincial  and  district  hospitals  nationwide  lack  clinical \nequipment and skilled health staff to manage severe COVID-19 cases, particularly for oxygen \ntherapy. MOH\u2019s oxygen baseline assessment found that none of the provincial hospitals had the \ncapacity to manage five or more critical COVID-19 cases. Noninvasive ventilation requires a high \nlevel of oxygen supply, and hospitals' overreliance on private oxygen providers was identified as \na constraint.16 A shortage of ambulances impedes the timely transfer of critically ill COVID-19 \npatients to hospitals. Fourteen provincial hospitals were selected for ADB support to strengthen \nemergency clinical care for COVID-19 patients, including upgraded oxygen supply. In parallel with \nthe health impacts of COVID-19, there is mounting evidence of an increase in the incidence of \ngender-based violence and psychosocial issues linked to the pandemic.17 Frontline hospital staff, \nwho are often the first point of contact for affected individuals, are poorly equipped to identify and \nrespond to these issues.  \n \n9.  Modality. The project meets ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing, which is an \nefficient modality for the expedited delivery of support to build subnational health system capacity \nfor COVID-19 responses. The approach leverages MOH\u2019s experience under the original project \nin implementing targeted interventions with provincial and district referral hospitals, enabling a \nrapid nationwide scale-up. The proposed additional financing was determined to be technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sound. The project was prepared under COVID-19 \nfast-track processing but will follow regular Board consideration procedures.18  \n \n10.  Strategic alignment. The project is consistent with the operational priorities of ADB's \nStrategy 2030 to (i) address remaining poverty and inequalities by achieving better health for all; \n(ii)  accelerate  progress  in  gender  equality  in  human  development;  and  (iii)  foster  regional \ncooperation and integration, including the promotion of regional public goods to mitigate cross-\nborder risks of communicable disease.19 The project contributes to ADB's country partnership \nstrategy, 2019\u20132023 for Cambodia by strengthening human capital.20 It also contributes to the \ncollective goal of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries to improve the GMS health \nsystem response to acute public health threats.21 \n \n15  The use of antigen-detecting diagnostic tests was incorporated into the national testing strategy alongside real-time \npolymerase chain reaction tests. Rapid tests are used to support timely outbreak investigation and contact tracing \namong high-risk populations. \n16  All 116 provincial and district referral hospitals in the country use cylinders as the primary source of oxygen for \npatients and are dependent on private sector suppliers for cylinder refills. Hospitals face the risk of interrupted or \ninsufficient oxygen supply in an outbreak scenario because of supply chain constraints beyond the hospital\u2019s control. \n17  CARE International. 2020.

The overall project is aligned with the following impact: GMS public health security \nstrengthened.22 It will have the following outcome: GMS health system performance with regard \nto health security improved.23 \n \n12.  The impact and outcome remain unchanged from the original project. The additional \nfinancing will contribute to Cambodia\u2019s progress in complying with the requirements of the IHR \nand the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, in line with the original project outcome \nindicators.24 The outcome will be achieved through a nationwide scale-up of investment in \nsubnational  health  systems  in  the  priority  areas  of  surveillance  and  risk  communications, \nlaboratory and IPC facilities, and health service provision. Activities under the additional financing \nwill be delivered through the existing project outputs 2, 3, and 4 (footnote 3). \n \n13.  Output  2:  National  disease  surveillance  and  outbreak  response  systems \nstrengthened. The additional financing loan will finance (i) a nationwide training program for \nsurveillance staff and rapid response teams to strengthen subnational capacity for communicable \ndisease prevention, detection, and response; (ii) outbreak response vehicles for provincial and \nnational agencies; and (iii) health education campaigns to enhance communities\u2019 preparedness \nfor COVID-19 and other communicable disease threats.  \n \n14.  The  JFPR  grant  will  finance  digital  technology  to  reinforce  COVID-19  outbreak \nmanagement and contact tracing. It will (i) upgrade computer hardware for central, provincial, and \ndistrict health agencies; and (ii) train surveillance staff in these agencies on digital tools to support \noutbreak management. 25 The grant will further support the training of rapid response teams in \nfield skills needed for outbreak control, and training of health and non-health staff in COVID-19 \nrisk communications.  \n \n15.  Output  3:  Laboratory  services  and  hospital  infection  prevention  and  control  \nimproved. The additional financing loan will support laboratory services and IPC in 8 provincial \nhospitals and 73 district referral hospitals not included under the original project. It will (i) equip \nthe  laboratories  in  these  81  hospitals  for  communicable  disease  diagnostics  and  clinical \nmanagement, including COVID-19 rapid testing; (ii) renovate laboratories in 62 of these hospitals; \n(iii) install modern solid waste treatment systems in 42 hospitals; and (iv) supply autoclaves, \nwashing machines, and other IPC equipment to hospitals where upgrades are required. Female \nand male hospital staff will be trained in laboratory and IPC practices. \n \n16.  Output 4: Emergency preparedness and response capacity for coronavirus disease \nstrengthened. The JFPR grant will boost COVID-19-related clinical care capacity in 14 provincial \nhospitals. It will equip these hospitals with (i) oxygen plants for the onsite generation of oxygen \nsupply, (ii) clinical equipment for the provision of oxygen therapy, and (iii) ambulances for the \ntransportation of COVID-19 patients requiring emergency care. Female and male clinical staff will \nbe trained in oxygen therapy and the management of COVID-19 patients. Staff will also be trained \nto identify and provide support and referral options to individuals affected by gender-based \nviolence and mental health issues linked to the pandemic. Technicians will be trained in the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of oxygen plants and ambulances. \n \n22  Defined by the Greater Mekong Subregion Health Security Project. \n23  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n24  WHO. 2017.

Value Added by ADB \n17.  Since 2011, ADB\u2019s support to Cambodia\u2019s health sector focused on projects to control \ncommunicable diseases.26 These projects helped improve the capacity of Cambodia\u2019s national \nhealth system for preventing, detecting, and responding to public health threats. Leveraging \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  supporting  national  communicable  disease  control  programs,  the \ngovernment requested ADB\u2019s support to scale up the health sector\u2019s response to COVID-19. ADB \ninitially procured $1.7 million of personal protective equipment and assisted MOH's digital health \ninitiatives.27 This was followed by the COVID-19 Active Response Expenditure Support (CARES) \nProgram under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option that \nincluded $60 million in budget support for national health system strengthening under MOH\u2019s \nphase 1 COVID-19 Response Plan (para. 4).28 The additional financing complements the CARES \nProgram and aligns with the recommendations from CARES Program monitoring to strengthen \nsubnational preparedness for responding to localized outbreaks. The additional financing will also \ncomplement the proposed Cambodia Rapid Immunization Support Project under the Asia Pacific \nVaccines Access Facility to provide ADB financing for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines \nand related international logistics.29  \n  \n18.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  coordinates  with  development  partners \nthrough sector working groups to align support to the health sector\u2019s response to COVID-19.30 \nThe World Bank provided $34 million support for selected interventions under the MOH\u2019s phase-\n1  COVID-19  Response  Plan.31 The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  WHO,  the \nGovernment of Australia, and the World Bank are providing financing and technical support for \nthe implementation of the government\u2019s vaccination plan. The Government of Japan is supporting \nthe procurement of oxygen plants for 10 national and provincial hospitals through the United \nNations Office for Project Services and will also provide 100 ambulances to be allocated to health \nfacilities. The Government of Cambodia\u2019s submission to the Global Fund's COVID-19 Response \nMechanism includes investments in surveillance and response systems; risk communications; \nand clinical care, including oxygen therapy.

For the proposed additional financing, climate mitigation is estimated to cost $4.58 million. \nADB will finance 100% of mitigation costs. Climate mitigation benefits primarily result from the \npromotion of non-incineration-based medical waste treatment systems.33  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements will remain consistent with the original project. MOH, \nthrough its Department of Planning and Health Information, will be the executing agency. The \nexisting  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  manage  the  implementation  of  the  proposed \nadditional financing. Implementing agencies are the Department of Communicable Disease \nControl, the Department of Hospital Services, the National Institute for Public Health, the National \nCenter  for  Parasitology,  Entomology  and  Malaria  Control,  and  the  health  departments  of \nCambodia\u2019s 24 provinces and the Phnom Penh municipality.  \n \n24.  All procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n \n33  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As procurement will support the \nCOVID-19 response, universal procurement will apply to any procurement under the loan, but not \nto the procurement under the JFPR grant.34  \n \n25.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  MOH completed rapid assessments of the 81 provincial and district referral hospitals to \ndetermine the need for upgrades and equipment procurement. Equipment and works procured \nunder the project align with each hospital\u2019s Complementary Package of Activities level.35 The \nDepartment of Hospital Services completed an assessment of oxygen therapy needs in hospitals \nnationwide to determine the procurement requirements for oxygen plants and clinical equipment. \nThe specifications for the equipment to be supplied to 14 hospitals under output 4 will be reviewed \nby the Department of Hospital Services and the National Institute for Public Health. \n \n34  ADB. 2020.

Economic Viability \n \n27.  The economic analysis was updated following ADB's Guidelines on Economic Analysis \n(2017).36 The cost-effectiveness analysis of the additional financing project followed the benefit \nvaluation method used in the economic analysis of the original project. An expanded target \npopulation of 9 million in 11 additional provinces and Phnom Penh municipality was applied as \nthe basis for assessing cost effectiveness. Benefits from the project\u2019s activities were measured \nby the averted loss using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).37 The results show that the cost \nper DALY is substantially less than three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, \nmaking the intervention very cost-effective.38 The results are robust under various sensitivity \nscenarios. The cost\u2013benefit analysis conducted for the original project was also updated. An \neconomic internal rate of return of 31.8 % was estimated for the regional project as a whole. This \nis higher than that of the original project (28.1%) and is above the minimum required threshold of \n6.0% for social sector investments. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The financial sustainability analysis will be completed within 3 months from the date of \nsigning of the loan agreement.39 It will assess the capacity of MOH to pay for the incremental \nrecurrent costs of the project and the O&M of assets throughout their economic life. MOH receives \nannual budgetary appropriation from the national government for O&M. Historical and projected \nfinancial information on the budgetary appropriation, actual utilization, and O&M requirement will \nbe  analyzed.  The  analysis  will  further  determine  if  MOH  has  sufficient  residual  budgetary \nallocation to pay for the incremental O&M costs. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  A financial management assessment conducted in June 2021 concluded that the overall \npre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate because the project will use the original \nproject PMU. Key financial management risks are that (i) the potential for limited government \nfinancial resources for the health sector adversely impacts project sustainability, (ii) the large \nnumber of implementing agencies heightens the complexity of the project\u2019s financial management \narrangements, (iii) weak government planning and budgeting capacity reduces the effectiveness \nof  the  budget  process,  and  (iv)  inadequate  numbers  and  quality  of  financial  management \npersonnel at the project implementing agencies may impose limitations. In addition to the use of \nthe original project PMU, risks will be mitigated by the provision of financial management training \nto project implementing agencies.  \n \n30.  The project procurement risk was assessed to be low given the similarity of scope with \nthe original project and the recent relevant procurement experience of the executing agency. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOH.

At the national level, an Anticorruption Council and an \nAnticorruption Unit exist, but their effectiveness is reduced by incomplete supporting legislation \nand a weak judiciary. Project-specific corruption risk is mitigated through government oversight \nbodies,  development  partner  coordination,  and  MOH  (through  PMU  staff  responsible  for \nenhancing the internal control of procurement and financial management). The corruption risk for \nthe additional financing project is assessed as medium. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Key poverty and social issues. The additional financing project is classified as a general \nintervention. The COVID-19 pandemic has put Cambodia\u2019s gains in poverty reduction at risk, \npotentially reversing 4 years of progress in the Human Development Index.40 A slowdown in the \ngarment, construction, and tourism industries has impaired the livelihoods of low-skilled and \ninformal workers.41 Migrant workers have also been impacted. Households are at high risk of \nbeing burdened financially by COVID-19\u2013related illness, both because of loss of income and the \npreference of households to initiate care in the private sector, where out-of-pocket expenses are \nhigh.42 Out-of-pocket payments constituted 58.6% of total health expenditure in 2016, driven by \na preference to initiate care in the private sector. Households in the lowest two income quintiles \nare more vulnerable to out-of-pocket spending. The project will strengthen the capacity of the \npublic health system to prevent and treat COVID-19, mitigating health and social impacts and \nindirectly contributing to poverty reduction.  \n \n33.  Gender. The additional financing is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. In \nCambodia, female health care workers are overrepresented in frontline positions where the \nexposure to COVID-19 infection is the greatest.43 In contrast, women are underrepresented \namongst laboratory professionals.44 An assessment of gender-related risk factors for workplace \ninfection during pandemics is needed to improve IPC policy and practice. Prioritizing female \nlaboratory staff for training will contribute to better career options. The pandemic led to an \nincrease in the incidence of gender-based violence (footnote 17). An increase in the incidence of \npsychosocial conditions, including anxiety and depression among women, was also observed. \nThe GAP for the original project was updated to incorporate additional gender actions and targets \nunder outputs 2, 3, and 4: (i) an assessment of gender-related infection risks for frontline health \ncare workers during pandemics completed and disseminated to MOH policy makers and hospitals \nadministrators;  (ii)  equal  representation  of  female  and  male  staff  in  training  in  laboratory \ntechniques; (iii) upskilling of female and male health care workers to provide support and referral \noptions to persons affected by gender-based violence and mental health issues; (iv) provision of \neducation materials to health care workers, patients, and their families on mental health and \npsychosocial support during times of crisis; and (v) collection and reporting of sex-disaggregated \ndata on COVID-19. The PMU, with the support of a national gender specialist, will monitor GAP \nimplementation. Progress in GAP implementation will be included in all progress and monitoring \nand evaluation reports. Project data will be disaggregated by sex. \n \n \n40  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2021.

Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.45  \n \n35.  Environment (category B). Output 3 of the additional financing project will include minor \nrenovation  works  in  laboratories  of  existing  hospital  compounds. Output  4  will  include  the \ninstallation of oxygen plants at selected hospitals. Such works may cause temporary and localized \nadverse environmental impacts and pose minor risks to occupational and community health and \nsafety. These impacts and risks will be highly localized and short in duration. Risks will be \nmitigated to acceptable levels by implementing standard environmental management and health \nand safety practices, including measures to mitigate COVID-19 risk. The project will provide \nmodern  medical  waste  treatment  equipment  to  42  hospitals. 46  The  initial  environmental \nexamination and the environmental management plan prepared for the original project were \nupdated to reflect the expanded project scope.47 The overall project will remain category B for \nenvironment. The PMU, supported by the IPC and safeguard consultants, will coordinate the \nimplementation of the environmental management plan, including safeguard monitoring and \nreporting to ADB, and consultation with project-affected people during project implementation. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nare envisaged. The overall project will remain category C for involuntary resettlement. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Ten provinces to be supported under the project have \ndiverse indigenous populations.48 They comprise 3.9% of the population served by the hospitals \nto be supported by the project in these 10 provinces. The project will bring positive benefits to \nindigenous peoples in the project areas, specifically with respect to improved health care. An \nindigenous peoples plan was developed to maximize these benefits. Meaningful consultations \nwith indigenous people and their participation will help build awareness about the additional \nsupport provided by MOH during the COVID 19 pandemic. MOH will oversee the implementation \nof the indigenous peoples plan, with support from the PMU\u2019s national safeguard specialist. The \noverall project will remain category B for indigenous peoples. The scope of the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the original project will be extended to the additional financing. MOH \nwill report project-related complaints to ADB through quarterly progress reports. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.
