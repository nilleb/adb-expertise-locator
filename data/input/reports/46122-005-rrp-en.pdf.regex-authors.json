THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Maldives for the additional financing of the Preparing \nOuter Islands for Sustainable Energy Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The project finances the replacement of inefficient diesel-based power generation grids in \n160 outer islands of Maldives and in Mal\u00e9 with renewable-energy-ready grid systems (solar \nphotovoltaic\u2013battery\u2013diesel hybrid generation), energy management systems, and upgraded \ndistribution grids. The proposed additional financing will scale up and change the scope of the \ncurrent project by (i) scaling up renewable-energy-ready grid systems2 in additional outer islands;3 \n(ii) introducing disaster-resilient project components and gender-inclusive livelihood activities; and \n(iii) accelerating the pace of reform initiatives introduced in the current project through pilot \nprojects and policy measures. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Maldives is one of the world\u2019s most geographically dispersed countries with 1,192 islands \nspread across 800 kilometers of ocean. This dispersion and the small size of most inhabited \nislands make it extremely challenging to generate electricity centrally and distribute it through a \ncomprehensive grid network to realize economies of scale. The generation costs are estimated \nat $0.30\u2013$0.70 per kilowatt-hour (depending on the island),4 and this required government \nsubsidies of $58 million or 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. Fossil fuel imports \naccount for about 10% of the country\u2019s GDP, about half of this is for electricity generation, followed \nby about 40% for the transport sector.5 The heavy diesel dependence of Maldives also makes its \ncarbon  emissions  per  unit  of  electricity  among  the  highest  in  the  region.  As  a  low-lying \narchipelago, with an average elevation of 1.5 meters above sea level, Maldives is one of the most \nvulnerable countries globally to climate and disaster risks. Maldives consistently faces risk of \nsmall-scale and recurrent hazards, such as excessive precipitation, cyclonic winds, storm surges, \nsaltwater intrusion, and coastal flooding. It is estimated that Maldives may face an annual loss of \nup to a 2.3% of GDP by 2050 because of the impacts of climate change.6 \n \n4.  To improve energy security, the government has committed to increase the use of \nrenewable energy and promote energy efficiency. The current project has played a vital role in \nescalating the penetration of renewable energy in Maldives from less than 0.1 megawatt (MW) in \n2008 to more than 21.5 MW in 2020. The project was approved by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Board of Directors on 29 September 2014, financed through a grant from the ADB Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) not exceeding $38.0 million, and a grant from the \nStrategic Climate Fund, administered by ADB, of $12.0 million. The first additional cofinancing \nwas approved on 19 March 2015 and consisted of a grant of $5 million from the Japan Fund for \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Diesel generators are not financed under this additional financing. \n3  Outer islands are the islands in the atolls outside the Greater Mal\u00e9 region. \n4  Estimated during the feasibility studies of ongoing POISED project by Project Management Unit (PMU) under Ministry \nof Environment. \n5  Being a marine nation, whose territory is 90% water, Maldives is heavily dependent on sea transport for accessing \nservices as well as trading goods and for commuting. The consumption of diesel in sea transport has grown from \n149,000 tons in 2017 to 195,000 tons in 2019. \n6  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Assessing the Costs of Climate Change and Adaptation in South Asia. \nManila. ", "2 \nJoint Crediting Mechanism, administered by ADB. The current project and the first additional \nfinancing remain ongoing, with the grants expected for closure in the first quarter of 2021.7 The \nobjective of the current project is a shift towards clean and cost-effective energy sources. The \ncurrent project finances the replacement of inefficient diesel-based power generation grids in 160 \nouter  islands  of  Maldives  and  in  Mal\u00e9  with  renewable-energy-ready  grid  systems,  energy \nmanagement systems, and upgraded distribution grids. These interventions will contribute to \nreducing the cost of electricity, the subsidy burden on the government budget, and emissions, \nand will diversify the power generation mix. The project has two outputs: (i) renewable-energy-\nready grid systems developed for outer islands and the Greater Mal\u00e9 region; and (ii) capacity of \nthe Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the utilities\u2014the State Electricity Company Limited \n(STELCO) and FENAKA Corporation Limited8\u2014to implement renewable energy grid interventions \nenhanced. \n \n5.   The current project has installed more than 9.5 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity, 5.6 \nmegawatt-hours of battery storage, and 11.6 MW of energy-efficient diesel generators and \nassociated investments covering 70 outer islands across eight atolls. Also, the project supported \nthe government in developing a low-carbon development road map9 for the energy sector; \ninitiating regulatory reforms; and improving the capacity of the MOE, FENAKA, and STELCO \nfocusing on renewable energy. The additional financing will be prioritized in providing optimal \nrenewable-energy-based solutions targeting islands (i) operating purely on inefficient diesel \ngenerators; (ii) with heavy demand for ice to support fisheries; and (iii) pilot testing innovative \ncomponents which have potential for future replication. \n \n6.  Strengthening climate and disaster resilience. The low elevation combined with the \nnarrow width of the islands makes power system infrastructure vulnerable to flooding and other \nnatural hazards. At the community level, Maldives\u2019 high exposure to natural hazards and extreme \nweather together with vulnerabilities in fisheries (the main economic activity for the outer islands) \npresents significant challenges. Frequent rough seas and inclement weather during the northeast \nmonsoon (December\u2013March) and the southwest monsoon (May\u2013November), insufficient power \nsupply and frequent power outages, and the limited availability of ice-making plants for cold \nstorage  on  outer  islands  prevent  fishers from transporting  their  catch  to  larger  islands for \nprocessing and sale. Strengthening energy security, together with cold storage capacity, is \nneeded to enhance the resilience of livelihoods and, by extension, the wider community on outer \nislands. \n \n7.  Eligibility for additional financing. The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional \nfinancing. The project components to be supported through additional financing are (i) technically \nfeasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  accorded  as  high  priority  by  the \ngovernment; (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy.10 The implementation of the current project is progressing well with \n \n7  The original closing date for Grant 0409-MLD and Grant 0410-MLD was 30 June 2020, extended until 31 March \n2021. The original closing date of Grant 0429-MLD was 31 December 2019 and is on its second extension with a \nclosing date of 31 March 2021. \n  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and \nAdministration of Grant to the Republic of Maldives for the Preparing Outer Islands for Sustainable Energy \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n8  STELCO and FENAKA are the main electricity utilities responsible for supplying electricity to the communities of \ninhabited islands in Maldives. \n9  Though the road map was approved by the ministry in May 2019, there was a request from the new government to \nrevise the road map to align with the Strategic Action Plan 2019\u20132023. Revision is in progress and the road map is \nexpected to be published by October 2020. \n10 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2020\u20132024 is yet to be approved by the Board. ", "3 \ntotal commitments of $52.36 million (95.20%) and disbursements of $45.61 million (82.93%) as \nof 9 July 2020.11 The project has commissioned renewable-energy-ready grid systems, including \nenergy management system and grid upgrades in 70 islands. The project is on track to meet the \nexpected outputs and is compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements. \nThe project has been rated satisfactory in the project performance ratings since 2016, and the \nidentified risks of the project have been managed adequately.12 Hence, the current project is rated \nperforming  well.  Additional  financing  is  assessed  as  the  suitable  modality  for  this  support \nconsidering the strong links with the current project design, reform initiatives, and well-established \nimplementation agreements, which promise large efficiency gains. \n \n8.  COVID-19 impact. The global pandemic resulting from the novel coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) has significantly impacted the country\u2019s economy. The energy sector has not been \nspared,  with  the  finances  of  the  utilities  detrimentally  affected  by  reduced  demand  from \nremunerative industrial and commercial consumers. Coupled with poor bill collection rates,13 this \nis expected to create significant cash flow shortfalls through the first quarter of 2021. The real toll \nof the pandemic, however, is much higher, with thousands of livelihoods affected by the shutdown \nof tourism. Though oil prices have fallen to historic low values because of the pandemic, the \nfinancial difficulties in the energy sector will remain as institutions and households struggle to pay \ntheir utility bills. The crisis further emphasizes the need to improve the sector\u2019s financial viability \nby reducing electricity generation costs, which can be achieved by facilitating renewable energy \ninvestments as envisaged by the project. \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB and government priorities. The additional financing is well-aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 203014 operational priorities of (i) tackling climate change and building \nclimate and disaster resilience by reducing carbon dioxide emissions using indigenous renewable \ngeneration and climate-adaptive and disaster risk reduction investments to improve resilience, (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality by creating gender-equal and socially inclusive income- \ngeneration activities using renewable mini grids in remote islands, and (iii) promoting development \nof remote islands by introducing sustainable energy sources and creating economic opportunities \nin rural areas. The investment will support the achievement of nationally determined contributions15 \ntargets and is also aligned with the country\u2019s Strategic Action Plan 2019\u2013202316 by expanding the \nrenewable energy subsector and improving energy security through diversification of sources of \nenergy production. The project will support Sustainable Development Goals 5 and 7 by providing \naffordable  and  clean  energy;  improving  efficiency  through  distribution  grid  upgrades,  energy \nmanagement systems, and battery storage; and creating gender-equal and socially inclusive \nincome-generation  opportunities.  The  current  project  and  the  additional  financing  are  well-\n \n11 Total commitment is $35.77 million for Grant 0409-MLD and $4.59 million for Grant 0429-MLD. Disbursements \nachieved for Grants 0409 and 0429 are at $32.65 million and $0.96 million. Grant 0410-MLD ($12 million) has been \nfully disbursed and was financially closed on 31 July 2019. \n  ADB. 2014.

Project Description \n \n10.  The impact and outcome of the overall project remain the same as defined in the current \nproject  design.  Following  the  current  project,  the  additional  financing  will  finance  selected \nsubprojects on the basis of eligibility criteria agreed between ADB and the government. The \nadditional financing will scale up and change the scope of outputs 1 and 2 (paras. 11\u201312). \n \n11.  Output 1: Renewable-energy-ready grid systems developed for outer islands and \nthe Greater Mal\u00e9 region. The additional financing will scale up this output by introducing \nrenewable-energy-ready grid systems with grid upgrades, energy management systems, and \nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in additional 12 outer islands. The \noutput\u2019s scope will also be expanded to include (i) installation of solar-photovoltaic-based ice-\nmaking machines for four outer islands to support fisheries (the main economic activity in the \nouter islands), (ii) development of a climate- and disaster-resilient distribution system18 in one \nouter island, and (iii) pilot testing of a renewable-energy-operated ferry19 for transport of 30\u201340 \npassengers propelled by a combination of solar-photovoltaic panels and batteries, which has high \npotential for future replication. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  State  Electricity  Company \nLimited, and FENAKA to implement renewable energy grid interventions enhanced. The \nadditional financing will continue to support the project management unit (PMU) within the MOE \nto ensure close project monitoring and implementation of the overall project.20 Capacity building \nsupport to the MOE will be included for project monitoring and implementation, along with \nassistance for planning, designing, and implementing disaster-resilient project components. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  ADB has broad experience in Maldives through the current project, previous projects such \nas the Outer Island Electrification (Sector) Project,21 support in meeting electricity demand in the \ncapital of Mal\u00e9, and various technical assistance programs. ADB has experience in financing \nhybrid mini grids in rural and island-based communities in South Asia and Pacific countries.22 \n \n17 The World Bank\u2019s Accelerating Sustainable Private investments in Renewable Energy Project was concentrating \npurely on solar photovoltaic installations through the private sector in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region, and its planned \nintervention is similar to the project design focusing on hybrid systems. \n18 The climate- and disaster-resilient distribution system intervention supports the replacement of disaster-prone old \nradial distribution systems with a ring system, introducing flow meters for generators, smart metering with automatic \nmetering infrastructure, filters, and lightning protection devices to improve reliability and monitoring and allow high \npenetration of renewable energy. \n19 The population in outer islands and tourist resorts is heavily dependent on sea transport for commuting between \nislands. Approximately 20% of the important fossil fuels is used for passenger ferries and boats, which also makes \nsea transport expensive. \n20 The $50 million loan financed by the European Investment Bank, one of the cofinanciers, was made effective by the \ngovernment only on 21 November 2019. The support for the PMU through additional financing will ensure \nimplementation of the entire project. \n21 ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s experience in developing mini \ngrid  interventions  using  available  indigenous  energy  resources  to  support  gender-inclusive \nlivelihood activities will also be explored, particularly through the introduction of ice-making \nmachines to support fisheries. Innovative project components such as climate- and disaster-\nresilient distribution systems (footnote 17), a renewable-energy-operated ferry, and enhanced \nhybrid lithium-ion batteries23 will be introduced into the mini grid systems to adapt to extreme \nweather conditions and improve the emergency preparedness of the outer islands. This will also \nincrease the capability of the government to support essential services, such as health care, water \nsupply, and communications, during emergency situations such as COVID-19 and extreme \nweather  where  outer  islands  are  isolated  from  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region.  These  proposed \ninterventions are identified in the road map prepared for low-carbon development of the energy \nsector of Maldives under the current project and will add value in responding to crisis situations \nsuch as COVID-19 by improving community and system resilience. The action plan developed \nduring processing of this additional financing will set out key reforms with milestones to support \ninstitutional strengthening and policy enhancement. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  ADB staff undertook technical due diligence to establish the need for the additional \nfinancing in the context of supporting the government to attain Strategic Action Plan 2019\u20132023 \ngoals. ADB supported the MOE in conducting the feasibility studies and simulation to ascertain \nthat the project components provide the optimal solution for the investments. The technology and \ndesign selected is proven in Maldives, including its compatibility with local conditions, through \nongoing projects where similar installations were successfully commissioned in 70 outer islands. \n \n26 The procurement will follow the current project and will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n ", "8 \nThe project design has incorporated measures and elements to address climate change, increase \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n21.  Economic viability. The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.27 Without the project, power demand would be \nserved through existing inefficient diesel-based energy mini grids, which have additional costs \nassociated  with  diesel-based  generation,  transport  cost  of  fuel  to  remote  islands,  capital \nreplacement, spare parts, and lubrication oil. The hybrid renewable energy systems with relatively \nlow operating costs will displace diesel generators. Benefits identified are (i) avoided fuel costs \nwhen diesel-based generation is offset by equivalent amounts of renewable generation and (ii) \nthe environmental benefits from reduced carbon dioxide emissions. The economic analysis \nindicates an economic internal rate of return of 17.7% in constant 2020 prices. Given a hurdle \nrate of 9%, the project is deemed economically viable based on risk and sensitivity analyses.28 \n \n22.  Financial viability. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.29 The project will \nimprove financial and operational performance of the power utilities through reduction in fuel and \nother variable costs such as repairs, maintenance, and replacement of parts. Without the project, \nthe power utilities would continue to pay for expensive fuel and incur high operating costs. Project \ncash flows are calculated by subtracting projected cash flows for the without-project scenario from \nprojected cash flows for the with-project scenario. Diesel price is the most sensitive inputs for the \nproject. Although the analysis used the current historically low price as a base price, the result \nstill shows that the project is financially viable. The results indicate a financial internal rate of \nreturn of 7.51%, which is above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.29%; therefore, the \nproject is deemed financially viable (footnote 25). \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  The government provides two-way subsidies, through electricity tariffs and fuel costs, to \nreduce the cost of electricity for consumers. The energy subsidy remains a large burden on public \nexpenditure and adds to Maldives\u2019 fiscal burden. Under the adverse impact of COVID-19, the \ngovernment's financing needs are expected to increase, further weakening the fiscal position. The \ndevelopment of renewable energy is expected to improve the country\u2019s fiscal situation by reducing \nboth the volume of fossil fuel imports as well as the fiscal uncertainty arising from fuel price \nvolatility.  In  this  context,  harnessing  renewable  energy  is more  critical  with  the  COVID-19 \npandemic situation, as that will increase sustainability and financial health. \n \n24.  The power subsector in the Maldives has inherent constraints that hinder its financial \nsustainability. Most electricity is generated and distributed by two power utilities, STELCO and \nFENAKA, which operate diesel-based power stations in small and remote inhabited islands. They \nhave  been  financially  burdened  by  expensive  fuel  costs  and  resultant  high  operation  and \nmaintenance costs from inefficient diesel generators. However, their profitability has increased \nfrom 2017 to 2019, mainly because of continuous improvement in operational efficiency, in which \nthe current project played a vital role. STELCO and FENAKA will continue to benefit from scaling \nup renewable energy with lower generation costs and improved energy efficiency measures. \n \n27 ADB. 2017.

Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "9 \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk associated with the project is assessed \nsubstantial. The project funds will be managed solely by the PMU in the MOE, which has \nreasonably strong financial management and reporting systems in place. However, the assessed \nrisk  is  mainly  because  of  weaknesses  in  financial  management  as  well  as  the  financial \nsustainability of STELCO and FENAKA, the implementing agencies and ultimate custodians of \nthe assets created out of the project finances. The key risks identified for both STELCO and \nFENAKA  include  lack  of  appropriate  fixed-asset  record  keeping  and  physical  verifications, \npersistent  unresolved audit observations, noncompliance with financial covenants included in the \ncurrent project, lack of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system at STELCO, and significant \ndelays in finalizing audited financial statements at FENAKA. The MOF, MOE, STELCO, and \nFENAKA have agreed on a comprehensive financial management action plan to address the \nidentified risks. Key mitigation measures include basing FENAKA fiscal year 2019 financial \nstatements  on  recently  concluded  fixed-asset  verifications  and  revaluations,  fast-tracking \nSTELCO  fixed-asset  verifications  and  revaluations,  installing  an  ERP  system  at  STELCO \n(currently in progress), and the MOF approving and Implementing a financial restructuring plan. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Poverty reduction and social issues were reviewed for subprojects during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. The project will provide several direct benefits to communities: \n(i)  renewable  energy  sources  available  on  islands;  (ii)  sustainable  energy  and  economic \ndevelopment;  (iii)  energy  supply  to  homes  and  for  productive  energy  use;  (iv)  livelihood \ndevelopment through poverty reduction and improvement in the quality of life; (v) capacity \ndevelopment opportunities for women\u2019s groups; and (vi) development of a gender-equality-\nresponsive plan for outer island transition to renewable energy. \n \n28.  Gender equality issues and opportunities for mainstreaming were considered in the \npreparation of the project based on the due diligence carried out for the five sample islands. The \nadditional financing is classified as effective gender equality mainstreaming. A gender action plan \n(GAP), which integrates indicators and targets in the project design and monitoring framework, \nhas been prepared. The GAP has the following key outputs: (i) creating a household demand-\nside management program to improve energy efficiency, targeting female household consumers \nwho will link up with and further develop FENAKA\u2019s community outreach program; (ii) creating an \nenabling  environment  for  developing  women\u2019s  microenterprises;  (iii)  promoting  women\u2019s \nemployment and training during subproject construction and operation and maintenance of the \nelectricity assets on the islands; (iv) training FENAKA and STELCO staff in gender-inclusive \ncommunity  outreach  approaches;  and  (v)  designing  and  implementing  a  gender  equality \nmainstreamed  management  system.  The  island  women\u2019s  development  committees  will  be \nmobilized for community outreach and awareness-raising activities. Social development specialist \nservices  in  gender  and  development  will  continue  to  be  utilized  to  support  the  utilities  in \nimplementing the GAP. The overall project will promote and advocate a socially inclusive, gender \nequitable, and nondiscriminatory work environment and practices. Practices will be consistent \nwith core labor standards. The overall project will minimize the risk of HIV/AIDS through continued \ninformation  dissemination  campaigns  in  project  areas.  The  MOE,  through  the  PMU,  will \ncoordinate all gender-related activities through a gender focal point. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s safeguard categories \nare as follows. \n \n30.  Environment (category C). The additional financing is classified environment category C \nas the incremental activities are likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. \nThere are four new indicators in the additional financing: ice-making machines, a renewable-\nenergy-operated ferry, a disaster-resilient distribution system, and capacity building.30 The ice-\nmaking machines are not plant scale but are small warehouse-type facilities and are expected to \nbe installed at four locations along with solar photovoltaic systems. In a pilot test, the machines \ndid not cause any environmental issues except minor vegetation clearing to locate them. The \nrenewable-energy-operated ferry to be purchased is for local transportation of 30\u201340 passengers, \nand it does not need any ballast water management. The climate-change-resilient distribution \nsystem is the same as in the existing distribution intervention, but only adopting improved \nequipment in the system. Though the incremental risk is low, environmental due diligence during \nthe implementation will cover these additional interventions as well as the existing ones in the \noriginal scope. The current project is classified category B and it has been implemented in \naccordance with the environmental assessment and review framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement with submission of required initial environmental examinations and monitoring \nreports. A necessary covenant which cross-references the safeguards covenants of the original \ngrant agreement is included in the grant agreement of the additional financing. The initial \nenvironmental examinations required by the environmental assessment and review framework of \nthe current project will be continuously prepared for both existing and additional activities, and \nmonitoring  reports  covering  the  implementation  status  of  both  the  current  project  and  the \nadditional financing will also be provided semiannually. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nadditional financing is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and C for indigenous \npeoples. Due diligence conducted on sample subprojects showed no resettlement impacts and \nno adverse impacts on indigenous groups. The current project is classified category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Due diligence finds the project \nto be in compliance with involuntary resettlement safeguards requirements. A resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared  for  the  overall  project.  If  any  changes  or  additional  land \nrequirements or involuntary resettlement impacts emerge during implementation of a subproject, \na resettlement plan will be prepared or modified according to the applicable laws referred to in \nthe resettlement framework. ADB\u2019s approval will be obtained before implementation of the \nsubproject continues. The social and environmental safeguards will be conducted by FENAKA \nand STELCO, assisted by the PMU. \n \nG.  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31  \n \n \n \n \n30 For solar photovoltaic\u2013battery\u2013diesel hybrid systems in an additional 12 outer islands under output 1, the intervention \nhas been included in the original scope, but only locations are added.
