THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Climate- and Disaster-Resilient Irrigation and Drainage \nModernization in the Vakhsh River Basin Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Support to Operation and Maintenance and Financial Sustainability of Water \nResources Infrastructure, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project is the first gender equity themed irrigation and drainage (I&D) investment of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Tajikistan. The project will enhance climate resilience, \nwater productivity, and the income of female and male farmers by modernizing selected areas of \nthe Yovon I&D system, located in Khatlon province of the lower Vakhsh river basin. The project \nwill introduce (i) climate- and disaster-resilient modernization of prioritized I&D infrastructure, \n(ii) streamlined institutions and systems for effective planning and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of I&D infrastructure, and (iii) policies and strategies for gender equality to enhance \nwomen\u2019s participation in land and water management. About 6,700 farmers in the Yovon I&D \nsystem, of whom 12% are female, and 4,200 homestead (kitchen) gardens in the core project \narea,1 which are mostly managed by women, will benefit from improved water service delivery, \nenergy savings, and application of climate-smart technologies in I&D. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Reliance on agriculture. Tajikistan is a landlocked and mountainous country with a \npopulation of 9.3 million, of which 44.7% was employed in agriculture and 26.3% lived below the \npoverty line in 2019.2 The country has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $822. It has \na narrow economic base reliant on limited raw products (cotton and aluminum) and remittances.3 \nMale laborers from the rural areas constitute about 95% of Tajik migrant labor.4 In 2020, \nremittances  comprised  26.7%  of  GDP  and  agriculture  23.8%  (footnote  3).  The  country  is \nvulnerable to economic shocks resulting from fluctuations in regional demand. The agriculture \nsector grew by 9.3% from 1997 to 2004 and by 6.4% from 2005 to 2014. This decline was caused \nby low agricultural productivity. With only 7% of land being arable, limited land per capita of 0.1 \nhectares (ha), and underdeveloped agriculture, Tajikistan has one of the highest levels of food \ninsecurity in the world. It ranks 85th out of 113 countries for food insecurity.5 Undernourishment \nrates are high (30% in 2017), with a disproportionately high percentage of undernourished \nwomen.6 Food insecurity is expected to increase because of limited capacity to respond to \nclimate- and earthquake-induced shocks that will adversely affect agricultural production. \n \n \n1  The core project area refers to the irrigable area of four water users associations (WUAs). These are (Istiklol 2010, \nChorgul-2012, Norin, and Obi Yovon). The total core area is 9,830 ha(25%) of the entire system\u2019s command area of \n40,360 ha. Secondary and tertiary I&D modernization will be focused in the core area. \n2  World Bank. Open Data.

Tajikistan ranked 137th out of 153 countries on the global \ngender gap index, scoring low on women\u2019s economic participation and political empowerment.7 \nThe high level of male outmigration has led to a substantial increase in women\u2019s responsibilities \nin agriculture. The proportion of women in the agricultural labor force increased from 54% in 1999 \nto  more  than  75%  in  2020.8 Women  operate  homestead  gardens  (cultivating  fruits  and \nvegetables) to meet their nutritional and food security needs. Dekhan (farmer) farms headed by \nwomen produce cotton, wheat, and fodder crops. Women also manage water collection and \nallocation within the household for productive and domestic uses, and hygiene maintenance. \nDespite women\u2019s crucial role in agriculture and as primary water users, they do not have equal \naccess to knowledge and inputs for improved agricultural productivity. They also have a limited \nrole in decision-making on water management because of their low representation in water users\u2019 \nassociations (WUAs). This is because membership is dependent on having a land certificate, \nwhich few women farmers possess (footnote 4). In the social and gender analysis conducted for \nthe project, women farmers comprise only 20% of the membership of 17 WUAs in the Vakhsh \nriver basin, with no women in leadership structures. \n \n5.  Vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards. The Vakhsh river is the major \ntributary of the Amu Darya, which is the largest in Central Asia. Tajikistan is highly vulnerable to \nthe adverse effects of climate change. Projections indicate that temperatures will increase by up \nto 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. Increases in the annual probability of meteorological drought are \npredicted from the current 3% to more than 25% by 2050. There is likely to be a shift in the Vakhsh \nriver flow regime with high flows occurring earlier in the year, in May instead of June or July, due \nto the earlier melting of snow and ice. Changes in climatic conditions are projected to have severe \neffects on agriculture in Tajikistan. Temperature increases leading to heat stress and increased \nwater demand for key crops, combined with increased drought incidence, will significantly reduce \nagricultural yields. The impacts of climate change will increase extreme flood events, resulting in \nhigher risks of landslides and mudflows and potentially costing many lives and livelihoods. \n \n6.  Tajikistan is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, and \nlandslides, potentially reducing irrigation system performance and agriculture productivity. From \n1992 to 2016, disasters affected more than 80% of the population and resulted in $1.8 billion in \neconomic losses.9 The earthquake hazard risk for the project area is rated high. This means that \nby the 2070s, there is more than a 20% chance of a potentially damaging earthquake.10 An \nearthquake in 2001 damaged the irrigation infrastructure in the Yovon I&D system, resulting in \nloss of irrigation for 11,724 ha of land. It also affected 56,000 people and 65,000 livestock.11 In \n2021, mudslides  destroyed  houses  and  bridges,  and  partially  damaged  the  Vakhsh  canal. \nFarmers and government agencies lack the knowledge and capacity to adapt agricultural and \nirrigation practices to changing climatic conditions and to natural hazards. \n \n7.  Aging infrastructure. Irrigation consumes about 85% of the annual total water resources \nof Tajikistan. The total irrigated area is 761,523 ha, with one-third of land supplied with irrigation \nwater by pumps. The I&D systems, which were developed prior to the country\u2019s independence in \n1991, have deteriorated or are entirely defunct.

More than 53,000 ha \nof land are in poor ameliorative condition because of deteriorated drainage. \n \n8.  The performance of I&D systems is further constrained by (i) severe underfunding of \nO&M;12 (ii) inflexible irrigation systems that do not allow farmers to adjust their irrigation schedules \nin response to climate-induced changes in water availability; (iii) inefficient collection of irrigation \nservice fees (ISFs);13 (iv) limited capacity of WUAs to pay higher ISFs; (v) weak capacity and \nservice orientation of the ALRI; (vi) low capacity to complete repairs in a timely manner after \ndisaster events; and (vii) fragile WUAs with low skills, lack of knowledge of climate-smart \nagricultural practices, and limited inputs for improved agricultural productivity. Deteriorated I&D \nfacilities and poor on-farm water management result in low crop yields, excessive water losses, \nwaterlogging, and soil salinization. \n \n9.  Water sector reforms and institutions. The Government of Tajikistan undertook sector \nreforms in 2013 that assigned water resources planning and regulation to the newly created \nMinistry of Energy and Water Resources. Water resources infrastructure management, service \nprovision, and O&M were assigned to the ALRI. Regional and district ALRI offices are responsible \nfor O&M of the main I&D systems, and for providing I&D services to WUAs. A new Water Code \nassigns to the government the functions of setting tariffs for water supply services and designating \nsources and procedures for financing O&M of national water facilities,14 leaving little decision-\nmaking latitude for ALRI. A new WUA Law was signed in 2020.15 It defines the economic, \norganizational, and legal based of WUAs. It gives WUAs right and responsibility to operate and \nmaintain hydraulic structures and equipment and authorizes the creation of a union of WUAs. \n \n10.  COVID-19 pandemic. Tajikistan has experienced significant adverse economic and social \nimpacts from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. GDP growth dropped from 7.5% in \n2019 to 4.5% in 2020. Unemployment rose to 6.1% by the end of 2020 from 2.0% in early 2020. \nCOVID-19 had significant impacts on remittances, tourism, and trade, with remittances falling by \n14.8% in the first half of 2020.16 The strengthened climate and disaster resilience within the project \narea  will  contribute  to  post-COVID-19  recovery  through  crop  diversification  and  increased \nagricultural production, leading to improved livelihoods and food security. \n \n11.  Opportunities  and  lessons.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  support  I&D \nimprovement in the country through investment projects and TAs. These are delineated across \nthe four major river basins with complementary activities such as river basin planning and WUA \nstrengthening. ADB has extensive experience in I&D and flood risk management in the Pyanj river \nbasin. It is also the first development partner to invest in I&D infrastructure in the Vakhsh river \nbasin. Lessons from I&D projects in Tajikistan include (i) interlinking capacity building of water \nmanagement institutions with infrastructure improvements; (ii) providing flexible, equitable, and \nreliable  service  delivery  to  farmers  to  adapt  to  current  and  future  climate  variabilities;  (iii) \naddressing cost recovery for sustainable O&M at the outset of the project; (iv) identifying and \nintroducing water management technologies that are appropriate for local conditions; and (v) \norganizing targeted gender activities for women\u2019s empowerment in irrigated agriculture. \n \n12 Financing O&M for the I&D system is controlled by the government, including setting tariffs for water supply services, \nand sources and procedures for financing O&M water facilities, including I&D systems. \n13 The government improved the ISF collection rate from 62.6% in 2015 to 88.7% in 2019, and increased ISFs in 2018 \nfrom TJS0.0177/cubic meter to TJS0.04/cubic meter. \n14 Government of Tajikistan. 2020.

ADB has worked closely with \nother development partners to coordinate project activities. The World Bank-financed Second \nPublic Employment for Sustainable Agriculture and Water Management Project supports the ALRI \nand WUAs for improved water management in the Kofarnihon river basin. It has also initiated a \nwater resources information system within the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the \nALRI. The World Bank- and European Union-funded Zarafshon Irrigation Rehabilitation and \nManagement Improvement Project complements ADB initiatives in I&D by increasing farmers\u2019 \nskills in crop diversification and improved infrastructure. \n \n13.  Strategic alignment. The project aligns with the following key government strategies: (i) \nthe National Water Strategy, 2016\u20132030, which defines food security and increased employment \nopportunities  as  strategic  development  goals,  and  emphasizes  efficient  allocation  of  water \nresources between competing sectors of the economy; (ii) the Water Sector Reform Program, \n2016\u20132025, which aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of water management and \nboost national agriculture production; (iii) the National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy, 2019\u2013\n2030, which aims to decrease and prevent existing and new disaster risks by strengthening the \nnational  capacity  in  disaster  risk management;17 and  (iv)  Tajikistan\u2019s  Nationally  Determined \nContribution submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which \nreduction of vulnerability to impacts of climate change through adaptation is a priority.18 \n \n14.  The project supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2021\u20132025.19 It will \nsupport Tajikistan in climate and disaster resilience for productive agriculture and improved \nnatural resources management. It will promote gender equity for increased access of women to \nproductive activities and improved incomes. It also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals;  the  Climate  Change  Operational  Framework,  2017\u20132030;  and  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030.20 Specifically, the project aligns with the Strategy 2030 operational priorities of (i) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (iv)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security;  and  (v) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity.21 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: food security and people\u2019s access to good \nquality nutrition increased.22 The project will have the following outcome: climate and disaster \nresilience, water productivity, and income of male and female farmers increased in selected areas \nof the Yovon I&D system.23 \n \n16.  Output  1:  Climate-  and  disaster-resilient  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure \nmodernized.

The  existing  project  steering  committee  established  for  ADB\u2019s  Water \nResources Management in Pyanj River Basin Project (footnote 28) will provide oversight and \ncoordination with other agencies. It will also provide strategic and policy guidance on project \nimplementation. \n \n26.  The PIG will be supported by a project implementation consultant (PIC) firm, comprising \ninternational and national experts. The PIC package will be procured through the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. All procurement and consultant recruitment will be conducted in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n27.  The TA aims to improve project asset and financial management. It will also strengthen \n \n ", "8 \nO&M cost recovery of the Yovon I&D system and related institutions such as the ALRI and the \nWUAs. It will reduce the burden on the national budget and contribute to improved sector \ngovernance and financial sustainability. The TA will deliver two outputs: (i) an asset and financial \nmanagement system (AFMS) designed for improved and efficient and sustainable infrastructure \nO&M, and (ii) an AFMS installed for reduced operational and financial sustainability risks and \nincreased transparency of O&M fund allocation. Staff will also be trained in its operation and in \ntroubleshooting. The key activities comprise (i) review of current O&M practices in the irrigation \nsector, (ii) assessment of the existing AFMS in the ALRI, (iii) design of an AFMS adapted to local \nconditions, (iv) procurement and installation of an AFMS, and (v) training of key stakeholders on \nAFMS operation. The financing plan, detailed activities, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements are in the attached TA.29 \n \n28.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The TA will be implemented from December 2021 \nuntil 2024. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of access to data and \ninformation, counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  Rigorous technical due diligence was undertaken during project preparation.30 It included \nassessing major risks and constraints to achieving the project outputs and outcome, identification \nof priority works, measures for climate change resilience and adaptation, and mitigation of water-\nrelated disasters. Satellite remote sensing established command and cropped areas, and water \nproductivity for major crops (cotton and wheat). Remote sensing was used for calculating crop \nwater requirements and water accounting. The TA undertook topographic surveys and prepared \nadvanced feasibility designs for the main system infrastructure and selected pumping stations.  \n \n30.  The due diligence confirms that (i) sufficient water will be available in the targeted area; \n(ii) a modernized irrigation system will be designed with flexibility to accommodate climate \nvariations; (iii) the use of buried pressurized piped distribution systems is an appropriate solution \nfor steeply sloping land and for increased water efficiency, flexibility in conveyance, and reduction \nof system O&M costs; and (iv) O&M practices and institutional arrangements will be improved. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n31.  The project economic and financial analyses estimated the incremental benefits and costs \nfor the projects under the with-project and without-project scenarios to assess economic viability. \nBenefits include improved crop intensity, yield and quality of production, and diversification of \ncrops because of reliable flexible water delivery. The economic internal rate of return for the \nproject is 19.9%, which is higher than the economic cost of capital of 9.0%, confirming the project\u2019s \neconomic viability.31 The household financial incremental income from the project is $188/ha \nexcluding returns to labor and $195/ha including returns to labor. Sensitivity analyses confirmed \nthat the investment is robust with regard to increased investment costs; reduced benefits (reduced \nproduct prices and yield increases, cropping intensity, and/or reduced diversification to higher- \n \n29 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Feasibility Report for Yovon Scheme and Proposed Investment Project (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nvalue crops); and delays in project completion.32 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n32.  The financial analysis and evaluation concluded that financial sustainability risk is high \nbecause of low O&M budget allocations, heavy dependency on central government support, and \nlimited capacity to manage and plan system O&M. ADB will provide support through the attached \nTA to (i) improve the ALRI\u2019s overall O&M, asset, and financial management; (ii) train ALRI staff \nto strengthen O&M planning and monitoring; and (iii) introduce efficient farming and water \nmanagement practices that will optimize the long-term operation of the modernized system for \nproject beneficiaries. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n33.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk for the ALRI and the SICLRC and/or PIG is high because of (i) a weak project \nfinancial management system; (ii) limited financial management capacity of the ALRI and SICLRC \nand/or PIG staff; (iii) absence of an internal audit function; (iv) weak asset management and \ninventory controls; (v) overall poor governance structure; (vi) poor oversight and accountability \nand responsibility for financial structures; and (vii) weak integrity, transparency, ethics, and \naccountability mechanisms.33 A time-bound  financial  management  action  plan  (FMAP)  was \nagreed with the government and detailed in the financial management assessment in the PAM \n(footnote  25).  The  FMAP  aims  to  ensure  that  the  ALRI  takes  stronger  responsibility  and \naccountability over the project and is directly involved in contract signing and overall project \nfinancial management. \n \n34.  Project procurement risk assessment rated procurement risk high for the ALRI. It is also \nassessed as high for SICLRC and/or PIG because of (i) implementation delays in past projects, \nand (ii) the ALRI\u2019s weak procurement capacity. Procurement risk mitigation measures were \nidentified through a strategic procurement planning exercise and were built into the project \nprocurement strategy. Value for money shall be achieved by (i) proposing contract packages to \nattract both international and national bidders based on market assessment; (ii) open competitive \nbidding using the single-stage: one envelope bidding procedure for most of the packages to \nenhance efficiency and transparency; and (iii) engaging the PIC using advance contracting to \nprovide detailed design, supervision, and implementation support. \n \n35.  The  assessment  recommended  that  project  implementation  arrangements  include \nqualified and strengthened SICLRC, PIG and PIOs, with support from the PIC. ADB and the ALRI \nwill jointly undertake reviews of the project at least once a year. They will assess project progress \nand performance, including procurement transactions; performance of contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants;  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project  assets;  and  identification  of  issues  and \nconstraints. ADB and the ALRI will determine any necessary remedial actions and adjustments. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the ALRI. An FMAP has been formulated, including measures requiring \nthe  ALRI  to  set  up  adequate  transparency,  accountability,  anticorruption,  and  integrity \nmechanisms. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 25) and the FMAP. \n \n32 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  In 2019, the average poverty rate within the project area was 32.8%, higher than the \nnational average of 26.3%. Female participation in the labor market was 31.3% compared to \n52.8% for men.34 Two-thirds of women in Tajikistan are engaged in the agriculture sector, but \nmany work under precarious conditions as informal agricultural workers. Cotton remains the major \ncrop, though farmers have started shifting to the production of other crops such as vegetables \nand fruits. Forced child labor in cotton cultivation is not evident in Tajikistan.35 \n \n38.  The project is categorized as gender equity theme and is designed to address gender \ndisparities in access to irrigation and agricultural services, decision-making in land and water \nmanagement, and program planning and implementation. A project-specific gender study carried \nout during project preparation revealed that women have fewer opportunities than men to \nparticipate in irrigation-related decision-making, and less access to knowledge, information, \ntraining, and employment (footnote 8). Because of the outmigration of men, women bear a \ndisproportionate share of the burden of irrigating crops. This is true especially at the end of the \nirrigation season, when water is not easily available for small-scale agricultural production. \nWomen mostly operate homestead gardens that often do not receive adequate irrigation water \nsupply because of limited or a lack of appropriate delivery infrastructure and poor irrigation \nscheduling. WUAs tend to prioritize irrigation water supplies for farms rather than homestead \ngardens. \n \n39.  The project will have significant positive impacts on women. It will increase the income of \n6,700 farmers, about 12% of whom are women. It will also increase the production of vegetables \nproduced by homesteads managed by women and install modernized and climate-resilient \nirrigation systems that will benefit dekhan farms and homesteads managed by women to improve \ncrop productivity. The project will also strengthen women\u2019s engagement in the management and \naccess to services of WUAs. This will be achieved by increasing their membership in WUAs, \nplacing them in leadership roles, and creating committees that will provide dedicated services to \nwomen farmers and agricultural workers. It will include improving their understanding of their legal \nrights and access to financial services for developing enterprises. Women\u2019s access to support \nservices  will  also  be  developed  through  capacity  building  activities,  and  the  provision  of \nagricultural inputs and simple farm equipment. The gender strategy to be developed for the ALRI \nand WUAs will guide gender mainstreaming in (i) systems, policies, and program implementation, \nincluding recruitment, promotion, and training of personnel; (ii) the design and delivery of services; \nand (iii) collection and reporting on information about land and water management.36 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.37 \n \n41.  Environment (category B). The ALRI prepared an initial environmental examination \nreport that identified a limited number of potential adverse impacts.38 These are associated with \n \n34 United Nations Development Programme. 2020.

Safeguard Categories. \n38 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). This includes the \nAMP. \n \n ", "11 \ncanal  construction  and  pipe  upgrading  and/or  installation.  They  will  be  addressed  through \nimplementation of an environmental management plan (EMP). This includes preparation and \nimplementation of a health and safety management plan and an emergency response plan by \ncontractors, both to address the COVID-19 risk to workers and local communities. No civil works \nwill be carried out in environmentally sensitive areas. \n \n42.  The existing (limited lengths of) buried I&D asbestos cement pipelines within the project \narea are in poor condition. Their upgrading is considered the key environmental issue. An \nasbestos management plan (AMP) was prepared as part of the EMP. During the detailed design, \nasbestos-containing materials (ACMs) in the system such as pipes, pumps, gaskets, and flumes \nwill be identified and recorded in an asbestos investigation report, and the exact ACM volume will \nbe determined. The handling, removal, transport, and safe disposal (where necessary) will be \nincluded in the asbestos abatement plan. For the ACMs to remain in place, there will be an \nasbestos O&M plan. The asbestos investigation report, asbestos abatement plan, and asbestos \nO&M plan will together form the updated AMP. The EMP and the AMP require the contractor to \nassign an asbestos supervisor and at least five asbestos workers, an environmental safeguards \nofficer, and a health and safety officer. They will be trained on asbestos management by the \ninternational environmental specialist mobilized as part of the team of the PIC. \n \n43.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Social safeguards due diligence has confirmed \nthat the works for the main system will be conducted strictly within the existing right of way and \nstate land where no private assets, encroachers, nor any other third-party land uses have been \nidentified.39 No involuntary resettlement impacts are expected. Modernization of the I&D tertiary \nsystems over the core project area of 9,830 ha comprises about 564 km of buried pipeline. A \nmaximum of 282 km of pipeline will be accessed for cleaning of wells and replacement of \npipelines. This will affect standing crops and trees within the farmland and homestead land. The \nfinal pipeline sections where access is required will only be known after a detailed investigation \nof the condition of the pipeline is conducted during detailed design. After the investigation is \ncompleted and the detailed design is prepared, screening will be conducted again to confirm the \nfinal involuntary resettlement impacts. It is estimated that a maximum of 147 ha of privately used \nland and 1,550 people may be temporarily affected. No physical displacement or severe impacts \nare expected. A land acquisition and resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with the \nland acquisition and resettlement framework prepared by the ALRI,40 and fully implemented \nbefore displacements occur. During the project preparation stage, public consultations were \nconducted and an estimated budget for compensation was calculated. All the social safeguard \nrequirements  and  entitlements  of  affected  peoples,  together  with  the  result  of  the  public \nconsultation and budget estimate, are documented in the land acquisition and resettlement \nframework. \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the project area, \nas per the definition of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n45.  The government has agreed that the project will adhere to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  and  the  country\u2019s  labor \nlegislations.41 \n \n \n39 The main system works comprise the main canal (0.6 km long), the right branch canal (85 km long), and the pumping \nstation. \n40 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Concerns over forced and child labor were raised, and it was acknowledged that the government has been active in \neliminating both forced and child labor. \n \n ", "12 \nG.
