I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Yunnan  Sustainable  Road  Maintenance \n(Sector) Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the sustainability of the trunk road network in Yunnan, one of \nthe PRC\u2019s least developed provinces. It will (i) rehabilitate about 890 kilometers (km) of trunk \nroads, (ii) introduce performance-based road maintenance on a pilot basis for 164 km of trunk \nroads,  (iii)  set  up  a  road  asset  management  system,  and  (iv)  implement  an  institutional \ndevelopment plan.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Yunnan is poor, mountainous, and, with 46 million people, densely populated. Because \nthe province is landlocked, trade with the rest of the PRC and with foreign countries involves \nland  transport  over  long  distances,  which  makes  its  products  less  competitive.  The  large \npockets of poverty that exist in the province are linked to inadequate road access, the limited \navailability of land, and cultural barriers to outmigration. In 2011, 27% of Yunnan\u2019s rural people \nwere living under the PRC\u2019s official poverty line of CNY2,300 in annual income.  \n \n4.  Yunnan  is  strategically  located  along  the  PRC\u2019s  border  with  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. About 60% of freight and 80% of passenger \ntransport  is  by  road.  The  Yunnan  Highway  Administration  Bureau  (YHAB)  of  the  Yunnan \nProvincial Department of Transport (YPDOT) manages a trunk road network of 24,089 km, \nincluding 45% of the province\u2019s paved roads. These roads connect with or form part of the \nnorthern and north\u2013south transport corridors of the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n5.  With strong support from central government, Yunnan has invested heavily in upgrading \nits transport network, and allotted an amount equivalent to 10% of the provincial gross domestic \nproduct in 2011. Nonetheless, the trunk road network has been inadequately maintained and is \noften in poor condition. This reduces the province\u2019s economic competitiveness and slows the \npace of poverty reduction. In 2011, YHAB rated only 37% of the trunk road network as being in \ngood condition; about 31% of the network was designated as very poor. The project preparatory \nTA consultant estimated that the pavement on almost one-half of the roads will soon need to be \ncompletely reconstructed. Despite this, traffic on the network has been rapidly increasing, which \nnot  only  further  damages  substandard  roads  but  threatens  to  degrade  newly  built  ones \nprematurely. Yunnan\u2019s economy is therefore suffering the effects of a vicious cycle afflicting the \ntrunk road network. Overemphasis on new road construction, along with funding and spending \ninefficiencies,  leaves  little  budget  for  necessary  maintenance.  The  lack  of  maintenance \nincreases  the  life  cycle  cost  of  pavement  care  and  thus  widens  the  future  maintenance \ndemand\u2013resource gap.  \n \n6.  Poor trunk road conditions have also reduced road safety. In 2009, the risk of being \nkilled in a road accident on the network was almost five times the rate in some developed \ncountries\u201430 fatalities per billion vehicle-kilometers, compared to about 6 in France and the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ", "2 \nUnited Kingdom. Although the road fatality rate has fallen since 2004, it could rise again as \ntraffic volume increases on older roads that are being ill-maintained and therefore becoming \nmore dangerous to use.  \n \n7.  The project design is based on a detailed analysis of how to make Yunnan\u2019s trunk road \nnetwork more sustainable. The network\u2019s current condition is the product of YHAB\u2019s historically \nlow maintenance budgets and high management costs. In 2011, YHAB\u2019s maintenance budget \nreached $350 million, or about $14,600 per network km. Of that total $263 million was spent on \nlabor and management costs, $47 million on routine maintenance and only $40 million on \nrehabilitation works. If past trends continue, future revenue increases will be absorbed by rising \nstaff costs. Meanwhile, road condition modeling studies show that the share of the network in \nvery poor condition may rise from 31% in 2011 to 40% in 2016 and 50% by 2021. To stop the \ndegradation and bring the network to a generally good condition, YHAB will need to double its \nmaintenance budget over a 10-year period. Such additional spending on rehabilitation works \nwould bring economic benefits to Yunnan worth 6\u201310 times the costs.3 \n \n8.  The  project  also  envisages  raising  the  cost-effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  YHAB \nmaintenance spending. As is a common practice in the PRC, YHAB uses its own work force to \ncarry  out  maintenance.  International  experience  has  shown,  however,  that  outsourcing \nmaintenance,  particularly  through  performance-based  contracts,  can  substantially  reduce \ncosts.4 Improved maintenance planning and programming methods would help to make better \nuse  of  YHAB  resources.  Road  condition  modeling  studies  show  that  using  a  road  asset \nmanagement system and prioritizing works based on works\u2019 economic returns would increase \nthe economic benefits of YHAB maintenance by 20% (footnote 3). \n \n9.  Making road maintenance in the PRC more sustainable is a strategic objective under the \ngovernment\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015). The government intends to achieve this by \nraising  the  priority  accorded  to  maintenance  relative  to  construction;  increasing  road \nrehabilitation efforts; reducing management costs and improving the efficiency of maintenance; \nand introducing market-based delivery mechanisms on a pilot basis. It is also emphasizing \ngreater road safety, the strengthening of environmental management practices, and the use of \nmodern maintenance planning systems. To reach these goals, YPDOT established a series of \nmedium-term targets for road maintenance through policy dialogue with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). YPDOT aims to (i) raise the proportion of roads rated in good condition from 40% \nof the trunk road network in 2011 to 50% in 2017, (ii) reduce the gap between maintenance \nfinancing needs and budgets from an estimated 50% to about 20%, (iii) increase the share of \nthe network that is rehabilitated each year from 0.5% to 4.0%, and (iv) modernize YHAB\u2019s \nmanagement systems and operational processes. \n \n10.  Yunnan\u2019s  road  maintenance  strategy  entails  policy  and  institutional  changes.  The \ngovernment has committed to increase YHAB\u2019s maintenance budget resources to about $550 \nmillion annually in 2017, or $24,000 per km. This is to be done initially by supplementing \nYHAB\u2019s budgetary resources with loans from development partners and gradually increasing \nfuel tax  allocations to YHAB  from  CNY1.7  billion in  2011  to CNY3.0  billion in  2017, with \nadditional resources to be spent on rehabilitation. To reduce costs and improve efficiency, \nYHAB will also gradually outsource road maintenance operations and reduce its management \nand  staff  costs.  Institutional  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  establishing  a  road  asset \n                                                \n3  Road Network Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  See, for example, World Bank. 2009.

YHAB will incorporate road safety improvements in the rehabilitation \nworks it undertakes.  \n  \n11.  These  changes  will  be  rolled  out  gradually  with  project  support.  Four  documents \ndeveloped during project preparation will guide implementation: (i) a road sector maintenance \nstrategy; (ii) an institutional development plan; (iii) a road sector roadmap that sets annual \ntargets for key performance and sustainability indicators, as well as policy reform milestones; \nand (iv) an operational manual. The manual will be used to improve YHAB\u2019s processes for \nplanning;  environmental,  social,  and  safety  management;  monitoring  systems;  and \nprocurement.5  \n \n12.  The government has asked ADB to support YHAB\u2019s trunk road maintenance program \nand assist in sector reform and institutional strengthening. The project represents a second \nphase of ADB support to road maintenance in Yunnan. In 2010, ADB approved lending support \nfor, among others, rehabilitation by YHAB of 605 km of trunk roads, and also helped YPDOT \npilot new forms of rural road maintenance. 6 The project draws on lessons from past ADB \nprojects for road maintenance by adopting a sector approach that can address Yunnan\u2019s trunk \nroad maintenance needs, key sector issues, and institutional constraints more comprehensively \nthan has been done in the past. ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is appropriate for a project that \ncomprises about 30 small-scale subprojects that are dispersed throughout Yunnan and must be \nimplemented in phases. The project qualifies for this modality because a sector development \nplan exists, the institutions involved have the capacity required, and it supports policy reforms \nthat are mandated under the country\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan. By targeting a poor province and by \nadvancing the agendas of road asset management and safety, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nPRC country partnership strategy for 2011\u201320157 and ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan.8   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the project will be improved access for the people of Yunnan to a quality \nand safe trunk road network. The outcome will be improved sustainability of Yunnan\u2019s trunk \nroad network.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The  project  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  890  km  of  trunk  roads  rehabilitated, \n(ii) performance-based road maintenance piloted for 164 km of trunk roads, (iii) road asset \nmanagement system enhanced, and (iv) institutional capacity of YHAB strengthened.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Trunk Road Rehabilitation \n15.  Rehabilitation program. The project will restore about 890 km of trunk road pavements \nto good condition through asphalt overlays on about 180 km of road and the reconstruction of \n                                                \n5  Sector Maintenance Strategy, Institutional Development Plan, Road Sector Roadmap, and Operational Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n6  ADB. 2010.

The  project  is  part  of  YHAB\u2019s  2013\u20132016  program  to  overlay, \nstrengthen,  or  reconstruct  pavement  on  about  2,250  km  of  trunk  highways.  The  program \nprioritizes (i) pavement strengthening, reconstruction, or asphalt overlay for roads with high \ntraffic of more than 2,000 vehicles per day that are rated in poor or very poor condition, and (ii) \npavement reconstruction for roads with medium traffic of 1,000\u20132,000 vehicles per day that are \nalready  rated  in  very  poor  condition.  Where  the  sub-base  has  failed,  pavement  will  be \nreconstructed. Where the pavement is still in fair condition but shows signs of deterioration, an \nasphalt overlay will be applied to extend pavement life. Where current or future traffic is higher \nthan planned for in the road\u2019s original design, the pavement will be strengthened.  \n \n16.  Subprojects. The works will be implemented in four phases, corresponding to YHAB\u2019s \nannual road maintenance plans for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Seven highway sections of 192 \nkm in total length were selected for phase I of the project based on their high traffic volume and \npoor condition.9 The roads were built 20\u201340 years ago, with satisfactory geometry and adequate \ncapacity, but the pavement has failed due to age and heavy traffic. At the start of the three \nsubsequent annual phases, YHAB will identify highway segments that require rehabilitation, and \ngive priority to the maintenance works that bring the highest economic returns. This will be \ndetermined through evaluation using a road asset management system and data from annual \ntraffic and road condition surveys. YHAB will prepare data on each subproject to be considered, \nwith information on its rationale; environmental, social, and road safety assessments; technical \nsolutions; cost estimates; economic evaluation; and schedule. Subprojects will conform to the \nagreed selection criteria, as confirmed by YHAB and endorsed by ADB.10  \n \n17.  Safety  enhancement.  The  project  will  take  steps  to  improve  road  safety  on  the \nsubproject roads. YHAB will coordinate road safety education activities with schools, village \ngroups, and local governments after works are completed. The rehabilitation will include safety \nfeature upgrades such as better signage, rumble strips, and improved grade and curve design. \nThe safety features to be undertaken will be chosen based on an assessment procedure set out \nin the manual prepared for the project. The operational manual provides a guide for classifying \nsafety risks as very high, high, moderate, and low, and prescribes the type and extent of the \nsafety features needed to match the level of risk. Based on preliminary design, about 10% of the \ncost of the phase I subprojects will be allocated to safety features. YHAB will conduct an \nindependent road safety audit of all subprojects at the detailed design and completion stages.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Performance-Based Road Maintenance \n18.  The project will introduce performance-based road maintenance on a pilot basis. Under \nthe performance-based road maintenance schemes, contractors will be paid for consistently \nmaintaining the road at a contractually stated performance standard over several years. This \ndiffers from other mechanisms linking payments to inputs, or outputs. To increase the potential \nfor lessons and replication, the project will pilot two performance-based modalities, one using \noutsourcing and the other a contract with YHAB\u2019s own maintenance work force. \n \n19.  The first pilot will be for ADB-funded rehabilitation and routine maintenance of a 57 km \nsegment of the G-323 highway in Wenshan Prefecture over 5 years. This will test the feasibility of \ncontracting-out  of  performance-based  maintenance  operations.  During  the  first  year,  the \n                                                \n9  ADB financing will be applied to four subprojects on highways G213, G320, and S211. The government will fully \nfinance three subprojects on G108, S321, and X214.  \n10 Subproject Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "5 \ncontractor will reconstruct 40 km of pavement and overlay an additional 17 km. During the \nfollowing 4 years, the contractor will undertake routine maintenance. The second pilot, funded by \nYHAB, will be for the periodic and the routine maintenance of a network of 107 km of paved roads \nwithin Ruili County in Dehong Prefecture for 3 years. This will test the feasibility of improving the \nefficiency of YHAB\u2019s internally delivered maintenance operations by introducing contractual and \nperformance-based mechanisms. To implement the pilot, YHAB will enter into a contractual \narrangement with its Ruili County maintenance section at a negotiated contract price and with a \nperformance agreement. An independent supervision engineer will undertake monthly inspections \nto  assess compliance with  the  performance standards  under  each  of  the  pilots. In case  of \nnonperformance, YHAB will make only partial payments to the contractor.11   \n \n3.  Output 3: Road Asset Management System \n20.  The project will introduce and launch a computerized road asset management system in \nYHAB. A new road database will consolidate YHAB\u2019s existing road inventory, road condition, \nequipment, and traffic databases. The highway network will be spatially referenced and use a \ngeographic information system. The system will also include (i) a road condition evaluation \nsystem, (ii) a pavement management system, (iii) a routine maintenance management system, \nand (iv) an interface with Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4) software for \nworks planning. It will make information on road conditions available online through a traffic \ninformation  subsystem.  To  set  up  and  maintain  the  road  asset  management  system,  the \nYunnan Scientific Research Institute under YHAB will carry out pavement condition surveys \neach year and update the road inventory. This system will be used by YHAB as an input in the \npreparation of annual and medium-term maintenance strategies and programs.  \n \n4.  Output 4: Institutional Development \n21.  The  project  will  increase  YHAB\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  new  approaches  to  road \nmaintenance,  help  implement  the  road  sector  maintenance  strategy  and  the  institutional \ndevelopment plan, and assist in monitoring the road sector roadmap. \n \n22.  Environment,  social,  and  safety  management.  YHAB  will  establish  a  new \nenvironment, social, and safety unit (ESSU) with three full-time staff members. The ESSU will \nhelp YHAB to (i) ensure that the project meets environmental, social, and safety requirements; \n(ii) conduct  road  safety  audits,  consultations,  and  environmental  and  social  assessments; \n(iii) develop environmental management instructions for maintenance works; (iv) prepare road \nsafety engineering guidelines and design and evaluate safety engineering measures; and (v) \nmonitor YHAB\u2019s environmental, social, and safety performance. \n \n23.  Performance  and  sustainability  assessment.  The  project  will  strengthen  YHAB\u2019s \nperformance management. YHAB will prepare a performance and sustainability assessment \nreport each year and submit it to ADB (footnote 11). The report will give a comprehensive \npicture  of  YHAB\u2019s  maintenance  program,  including  its  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \nmanagement  performance,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  its  environmental,  social,  and  safety \nmanagement processes. YHAB and ADB will jointly review progress, based on the indicators \nand annual targets set out in the road sector roadmap, and agree on any remedial action \nneeded.  \n \n                                                \n11  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "6 \n24.  Project management. A project management consultant will be recruited to provide \nsupport to YHAB to implement the project; select and prepare the subprojects for its second, \nthird, and fourth phases; provide training for the staff of the new ESSU; and advise in setting up \nthe ESSU procedures and guidelines.  \n \n25.  Training. The project will finance a 4-year program to provide training abroad and in the \nPRC  for  YHAB  personnel.  The  personnel  will  receive  100  person-months  of  international \ntraining and about 500 person-months of training in-country in road maintenance engineering, \nroad asset management, performance-based maintenance, and the management of road safety \nand environmental and social safeguards.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n26.  The project is estimated to cost $232.4 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na loan of $80.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 28-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,12 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. The government will meet the cost of financing \ncharges during implementation.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (footnote 11). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2013\u2013September 2018 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Yunnan Provincial Government \n(ii)   Executing agency  Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport  \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Yunnan Highway Administration Bureau \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project Management Office including 6 ADB project staff \nProcurement (ADB-financed  National competitive bidding  17 contracts (estimated)  $77.55 million \ncontract packages)  Shopping (goods)  5 contracts   $0.30 million \nConsulting services (ADB- Quality- and cost-based selection (80:20)  $2.15 million \nfinanced contract packages)  40 person-months international consulting services  \n3 person-months national consulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing are proposed for the recruitment of \nadvance contracting  the consulting services and for the procurement of the road asset management \ndatabase equipment and civil works. a \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \na  The amount to be retroactively financed will not exceed the equivalent of 10% of the ADB loan, and may finance \ncosts incurred before loan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan.  \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  The technical viability of the project was confirmed during preparation. The preliminary \ndesign of first-year works was prepared by the project preparatory TA. Maintenance and safety \npolicies and guidelines are detailed in the operational manual (footnote 5). Pavement repairs will \ninclude  various  technical  solutions,  including  local  repairs,  slurry  seals,  double  bituminous \nsurface treatment, concrete asphalt overlay, and reconstruction (asphalt overlay or surface \ntreatment over cement-treated gravel). Safety works will include provision of shoulders, lay-bys, \nsteep grade management, left-turn lanes at busy junctions, basic and enhanced centerline \n ", "8 \nmarkings, safety barriers, footpaths on sections near villages and towns, nonmotorized traffic \nlanes, and traffic calming measures.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The primary economic benefit of the road maintenance works will be a reduction in the \ncosts of transport (vehicle operating costs and time costs) along Yunnan\u2019s trunk roads by up to \n40%. The subprojects to be implemented in the first year of the project have an economic \ninternal rate of return of 34%. Sensitivity analysis showed that (i) under a worst-case scenario, \nincluding a substantial drop in the benefits by 66% and a 200% cost increase, the project would \nstill yield an economic rate of return of about 14%; and (ii) the investment costs would need to \nbe multiplied by 8 or the benefits be divided by 10 to yield a net present value equal to zero. A \nfinancial analysis indicated that, with respect to the availability of resources to cover the project \ncost and the loan service requirements, the project presents only a small financial risk.  \n \nC.  Procurement and Governance \n31.  All procurement for ADB-financed contracts will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement for ADB-financed civil works under outputs \n1  and  2  will  use  the  2012  Ministry  of  Finance  standard  bidding  documents  for  national \ncompetitive bidding agreed upon with ADB and the World Bank in 2012. For non-ADB financed \nworks and services, YHAB will use government procurement procedures.14 Procurement and \nfinancial assessments were carried out as part of project preparation. Financial management \nrisk is considered low, while the procurement risk is rated average based on YHAB\u2019s limited \nprior experience with ADB. To mitigate the risk, YHAB will recruit a procurement agent, and staff \ninvolved in the project will receive training in ADB procurement procedures and guidelines. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and YPDOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 11). An institutional assessment \ncarried out by ADB concluded that YHAB\u2019s capacity  to execute the project was generally \nappropriate but that it needed strengthening in the areas of planning, safety, environmental \nmanagement, and procurement.15  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project will benefit an estimated 12 million people, of whom 85% are rural residents. \nThe subprojects to be implemented in the first year of the project will directly benefit 4.17 million \npeople in five prefectures and 15 counties. The project preparatory TA consultant evaluated the \nimpact of recently completed pavement rehabilitation works in Yunnan. The evaluation shows \nthat the poor, particularly women, quickly benefited from increased transport opportunities once \nworks were completed. Specific impacts identified include: (i) greater and more diversified \nincome-generating  opportunities  for  households,  including  seasonal  work-related  migration \nopportunities; (ii) more reliable, frequent, and cheaper public transport, which benefitted women \nin particular; (iii) more timely transport of farm products over the improved  roads, which was \nespecially important to ensure that perishable commodities such as fruits, vegetables, and \nflowers arrived at markets in good condition; (iv) a reduction in farm input costs due to improved \ntransport from providers; (v) more small business activity alongside the roads; (vi) improved \n                                                \n14  Government procurement procedures include limited bidding for rehabilitation works. ADB assessed the efficiency \nof the procedures and concluded that YHAB could carry them out diligently and efficiently.  \n15  The findings are summarized in the Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "9 \nconnectivity and fewer road accidents, especially during the rainy season; and (vii) less dust \ngenerated by traffic in areas along the improved roads. \n \n33.  To  maximize the social  benefits  and  minimize  risks,  YHAB will implement  a social \ndevelopment action plan to undertake such steps as (i) facilitation of public transport services, \n(ii)  communication  with  local  stakeholders,  (iii) provision  of  employment  and  other  income \nopportunities during the works, and (iv) prevention of HIV/AIDS spread.16  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental examination and environmental management plan was prepared for the seven \nsubprojects chosen for rehabilitation during phase 1 (footnote 9)  and the pilot testing of the two \nperformance-based road maintenance modalities. These documents comply with the PRC\u2019s \nregulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and were disclosed on \nthe ADB website on 25 April 2013. Two of the subprojects have been classified as category B, \nand the rest as category C. The works will be confined to the original right-of-way of existing \nnational, provincial, and county roads. All identified environmental impacts will be mitigated \nthrough activities under the environmental management plan. An environmental assessment \nreview framework has been prepared to guide the assessment of subprojects to be identified \nand carried out later under the project\u2019s three subsequent phases.  YHAB accepted PPTA \nrecommendations to increase its environmental capacity, and tools have been developed to \nmanage environmental impacts and opportunities associated with maintenance activities (PAM, \npara. 65). \n \n35.  Social safeguards. Due diligence indicated that no land acquisition or resettlement will \nbe required for the first-year subprojects. While the subprojects yet to be selected for the \nremaining phases are expected to be similar, the project was classified as resettlement category \nB  to  allow  for  changes  at  detailed  design  stage  if  a  future  subproject  involves  modest \nresettlement due to road widening or straightening or to improve safety features. A resettlement \nframework and a sample resettlement plan have been prepared and were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 25 April 2013. Should a subproject require land acquisition or resettlement, the \nexecuting agency will prepare and submit resettlement plan(s) for ADB review and clearance; \nthis  will  include  a  participatory  consultation  process,  and  other  measures  defined  in  the \nresettlement  framework.  The  project  will  not  finance  a  subproject  that  requires  significant \nresettlement. Due diligence conducted during the project preparatory TA found no significant \nadverse impacts on ethnic  minorities in the project area that would trigger the indigenous \npeoples safeguard requirements, hence the project is classified as indigenous peoples category \nC.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n \n                                                \n16  The social development action plan is included in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient financing is made available for  The Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport has committed to \nmedium-term road maintenance.   gradually raising YHAB\u2019s allocation of fuel tax resources. \nYHAB lacks capacity to properly select  The project management consultant will help select and appraise the \nand appraise subsequent subprojects.  subprojects under the project\u2019s final three phases. \nYHAB has too little knowledge of the  The operational manual describes the new processes.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The government and YPDOT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents.  \n \n38.  The  government  and  YPDOT  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The government and \nYPDOT have further agreed that YPDOT and YHAB shall not award any works contract in \nrespect of works under phases II, III and IV of output 1 until YPDOT, YHAB and ADB shall have \nconcluded a memorandum of understanding in respect of the corresponding phase, following a \njoint  review  of  preparatory  steps,  including  selection  of  the  proposed  subprojects  for  the \nupcoming phase, and of the status of agreed measures under the road sector roadmap. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$80,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Yunnan Sustainable Road Maintenance \n(Sector)  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 28 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n5 November 2013 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines   Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nThe people of  Percentage of population in counties  YHAB road data and  The current level of attention \nYunnan have  where the average trunk road  YSRI road condition  paid by the PRC government \nimproved access to  condition is good or better (RQI\u226580)  survey  to road maintenance and \na quality and safe  increased to 60% by 2021 (2011    road safety continues to \ntrunk road network.   baseline: 17%)     increase in the 13th 5-year \n      plan (2016\u20132021). \n     \nAverage vehicle operating costs per    Road transport cost inflation \nvehicle-km on trunk roads reduced    is in line with PRC-wide \nby 10% in 2021 (2011 baseline:    inflation. \n$0.56/km)     \n    Risk \nRoad accident fatalities on national  Traffic police reports  Large natural disasters \nand provincial roads per 1 billion  significantly damage \nvehicle-km of registered vehicles in  Yunnan\u2019s trunk road network. \nYunnan reduced to 21 in 2021 \n(2009 baseline: 30) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThe sustainability of  Percentage of the surveyed trunk  YSRI road condition  Yunnan Provincial \nYunnan\u2019s trunk road  road length in good or excellent  survey, YHAB  Department of Transport fuel \nnetwork Improved.  condition (RQI\u226580) increased from  PSAR   tax revenues rise as steadily \n37% in 2011 to 50% by 2018    as expected. \n     \nSafety risk of 1,050 km of the trunk  YHAB PSAR  No major negative policy or \nnetwork lowered to low or medium,    institutional changes occur in \nas assessed by a safety audit by  the road sector.  \n2018 against medium to high in     \n2011     \n    Risk \nPercentage of the paved trunk  YHAB PSAR  YHAB is given responsibility \nnetwork rehabilitated every year    for new roads that are in poor \nincreased to 4% by 2018 (2010  condition, which depresses \nbaseline: 1.4%)   the overall average condition \n \n  of the trunk road network and \n \nPercentage of YHAB budget  increases the maintenance \nYHAB PSAR \nallocated to maintenance  burden.  \n \nimplementation (as defined in the   \n \nPSAR) increased to 45% by 2018 \n \n(2011 baseline: 25%)  \n \n \n \nPercentage of rehabilitation works \nESSU/YHAB PSAR \ncarried out by YHAB after an \n \nenvironmental screening and with \n \nan environmental management plan \n \nreaches 100% by 2018 (2011 \nbaseline: 0%)  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
