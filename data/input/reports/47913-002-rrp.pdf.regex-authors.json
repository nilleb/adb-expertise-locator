I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed A-\nloan of up to $35 million and (ii) a proposed political risk guarantee (PRG) of up to $15 million to \nMeeyahta Development Limited for the additional financing of the Yangon Urban Renewal and \nDistrict Cooling Project in Myanmar.1 The report also describes a proposed B loan of up to \n$5 million to Meeyahta for the additional financing of the Yangon Urban Renewal and District \nCooling Project in Myanmar, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and guarantee, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the B loan for the additional \nfinancing.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Myanmar  is  experiencing  dynamic  economic  growth  as  it  implements  political  and \neconomic reforms in its transition to a more democratic system and liberalized economy. It is \nalso experiencing a rapid influx of business and tourism since the country has become an \nappealing new destination for investment and sightseeing. However, the steady increase of \ninternational visitors and the surge in demand for hotel rooms, long-term accommodation, and \noffice space are currently overwhelming Yangon, the country\u2019s largest commercial city and \ntransit hub. Chronic underinvestment in tourism and business infrastructure has left the city with \ninadequate and insufficient working and living spaces, which inhibits economic growth, job \ncreation,  and  foreign  investment.  The  country  requires  an  estimated  $146 billion  in  urban \ninfrastructure investment for its large cities during 2010\u20132030; of this, almost 60% is required for \nresidential housing ($87 billion) and more than 10% ($17 billion) for commercial space.3 \n \n3.  The current project comprises the revitalization of an emerging central business district \nin Yangon, including hotel, retail, office, and residential space; and a district cooling plant and \nnetwork to serve the locality.4 It is being developed by Yoma Strategic Holdings, First Myanmar \nInvestment (FMI), Mitsubishi Corporation, and Mitsubishi Estate. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  is  providing  loan  and  equity  investment  in  parallel  with  the  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC). The current project will help reduce the acute shortage of business, tourism, \nand residential infrastructure in Yangon, and enable commercial activity and the import of \ncapital, skills, and technology that the country requires to transition to a modern economy. \n \n4.  The  concentration  of  business  and  tourism  activity  in  Yangon  will  put  increasing \npressure on public utilities and the environment. Yangon has a hot tropical monsoon climate in \nwhich daytime temperatures hover around 30\u00b0C. Accordingly, air conditioning is an expensive \nnecessity for businesses and tourism, and accounts for a significant percentage of electricity \nconsumption, especially during peak periods. The current project includes the country\u2019s first \ndistrict cooling plant, which will provide sustainable, efficient, reliable, and essential cooling \nservices.  The  plant  will  use  state-of-the-art  technology  to  significantly  reduce  electricity \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

Although the \nrestoration will not be part of the ADB or IFC financing, it will be a centerpiece to the overall development. \n ", "2 \nconsumption for cooling compared with conventional air conditioning. The plant will help reduce \nthe  strain  on  Yangon\u2019s  electrical  grid,  reduce  power  plant  fuel  consumption,  provide  cost \nsavings to end-users, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n5.  The Board approved the current project on 26 June 2014 (footnote 1). On 9 June 2015, \nthe ADB Investment Committee approved the extension of the Board approval validity period by \n1 year (until 26 June 2016).  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n6.  Impact. The overall project will increase business and tourism, while preserving and \nprotecting Myanmar\u2019s heritage. Tourism is an important part of the Myanmar economy and \nprovides immediate employment and income generation for the poor. \n \n7.  Outcome. The overall project outcome will be sustainable tourism and business growth \nin Yangon. The overall project will also raise tax revenues, improve foreign exchange earnings, \ncreate opportunities for small and medium-sized business, and increase the sourcing of local \ngoods and services, all of which contributes to economic growth and poverty alleviation. \n \n8.  Outputs.  The  overall  project  outputs  will  be  that  3.9  hectares  of  integrated  urban \nrenewal development in central Yangon is built and operating, and that an energy-efficient \ndistrict cooling system is installed. The overall project will play an important role in supplying \nbasic  tourism  and  business  infrastructure  in  Yangon,  which  will  support  productivity,  job \ncreation, and sustainable economic growth. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n9.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and the country strategy. ADB assistance for the \ncurrent  project  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2020,  which  supports  environmentally  sustainable, \nprivate-sector-assisted development  to meet growing  energy  demand  in  the region  and  to \novercome critical infrastructure shortages. Strategy 2020 also focuses support on livable and \nsustainable cities that reduce the carbon footprint, and on low-income and fragile countries.5 \nThe  assistance  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for \nMyanmar, which was extended to 2016 and supports environmentally sustainable development \nby  integrating  environmental  considerations  into  projects  for  promoting  green  and  climate-\nresilient growth.6 The interim strategy also aims to accelerate economic growth; create income \nopportunities; and create a supportive environment for the private sector, in particular for small \nand medium-sized enterprises. \n \n10.  Consistency with the sector strategy. The current project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy and its Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020,7 which both stress environmental \nsustainability and private sector participation, including specific investments in district cooling. \nThe current project is consistent with (i) the Urban Development and Water Sector Assessment, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n13.  ADB assistance will be essential in reaching financial close, as local and international \nbanks are unable to undertake projects of this scope and scale in Myanmar without support \nfrom multilateral development banks. In a country with limited financing options\u2014owing to its \nlong absence from international lending markets, lack of a track record, and nonexistence of \nlocal long-term financing\u2014multilateral assistance for large-scale projects is indispensable. \n \n14.  ADB assistance will help reduce the acute shortage of business infrastructure in Yangon \nand revitalize the city\u2019s emerging central business district of Yangon, and help the city become \nmore competitive and environmentally sustainable. \n \n15.  ADB assistance will help Myanmar capitalize on its untapped tourism potential, which \ncan have a significant role in economic growth and poverty reduction through direct and indirect \nemployment. Tourism is the most labor-intensive industry after agriculture, offering unskilled and \nsemiskilled opportunities in urban and rural areas, as well as gender equality\u201440% to 50% of \nall tourism workers in Myanmar are women. \n \n16.  ADB assistance provides a timely opportunity to help institute environmental and social \nsafeguards and best industry practices during early sector development. The project will adopt \nADB environmental and social safeguard policies, setting a standard for subsequent projects. \nMany Asian cities have experienced rapid urban growth, albeit at a heavy cost: sprawl, pollution, \nand congestion. The overall project will incorporate sound practices and investments in energy \nefficiency  and  leapfrog  technologies  (such  as  district  cooling  plants)  as  well  as  modern \nwastewater treatment systems. Improving the quality of life and mitigating climate change will \nhelp bolster Yangon as a vibrant and livable city with sustainable commerce and tourism. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the overall project is \nclassified  as  category  B  for  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. The change in scope has limited impact on the safeguard categorization \nsince the increase in floor area is achieved through more efficient use of space, and not from an \nincrease in the structural footprint or project site. The potential environmental and social impacts \nof the overall project were identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of Yoma, FMI, Mitsubishi Estate, Mitsubishi Corporation \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n ", "5  \n18.  The project has prepared an initial environmental examination to cover all aspects of the \nproject  following  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.13 The  initial  environmental  examination \nincludes  an  environmental  and  social  management  plan  to  adequately  manage  potential \nimpacts during construction and operation, such as noise, dust, water quality and quantity, solid \nand liquid waste, hazardous waste, exposure of workers to occupational health and safety \nhazards, and cultural heritage conservation. The project is developing internal risk management \nprocedures and assigning a director of risk management and compliance to be responsible for \noverall environmental and social risk management. To minimize and mitigate potential impacts, \nthe current project will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements;  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  general \nenvironmental, health, and safety guidelines; and national environmental laws and regulations. \n \n19.  The 3.9-hectare project site is located in the city core of Yangon on land belonging to the \nMRT. The site has been leased to Mee Ya Hta International Hotel since 1993, and the overall \nproject is not expected to have impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nDue diligence confirms that (i) no informal settlers or vendors use the project area, and (ii) the \ncurrent  project  area  and  surroundings  have  no  record  of  settlements  of  ethnic  groups  or \nindigenous peoples. The existing structures on the site are (i) Myanmar Railway Building, (ii) \nFMI Centre, (iii) Grand Mee Ya Hta Executive Residence, (iv) Zawygyi House, and (v) two \nabandoned residential buildings. With the exception of the Myanmar Railway Building, which will \nbe  architecturally  restored  and  converted  to  a  boutique  hotel,  the  other  buildings  will  be \ndemolished. The Grand Mee Ya Hta Executive Residence was vacated in October 2013. The \nFMI Centre (an office and commercial complex) and Zawygyi House (a restaurant) will be \nvacated by 2017, after providing at least 6 months\u2019 notice to existing tenants. The project \nengaged stakeholders in the surrounding communities during the project design. A grievance \nredress mechanism to deal with public complaints is in place. Consultations carried out as part \nof the initial environmental examination did not identify any outstanding grievances. \n \n20.  During construction, civil works contractors are expected to provide work opportunities \nfor 2,500 local community residents. During operation, significant employment will be created for \nlocal  residents  in  the  offices  and  commercial  establishments.  In  addition,  about  900  staff, \nexpected to be mostly local, will be employed in the hotels and serviced apartments. \n \n21.  Measures to benefit women or facilitate their involvement in construction and operation \nof the project were incorporated in the project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998). The overall project is classified as having some gender \nelements, and Meeyahta will work toward incorporating the following measures in the project: \n(i) prioritize hiring of women for 40% of the jobs created in hospitality and retail; and (ii) conduct \nskills  training  programs  for  locally  hired  staff  in  hospitality  areas,  with  at  least  40%  of \nparticipants to be women. The project will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.14 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n                                                \n13 The sections on project description and implementation schedule in the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for \nthe current project, dated February 2014, will be updated to reflect the overall project's NFA and implementation \nschedule. The environmental and social management plan, included as part of the IEE, is adequate to handle the \npotential  environment  and  social  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  In  line  with  the  disclosure \nrequirements outlined in the Safeguard Policy Statement, the updated IEE will be disclosed on ADB's website. \n14 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.
