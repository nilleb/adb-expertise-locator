Subprogram II consists of \na  loan  of  $100  million,  to  be  implemented  over  3  years,  and  a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant of $600,000, for capacity building \nand for supporting program implementation. \n   \nRationale  In the 1990s, the government of Assam faced fiscal and governance-\nrelated  structural  problems.  Its  weak  fiscal  position  was  due  to \nstagnation  of  tax  and  nontax  revenue  and  growing  recurrent \nexpenditure. The government also suffered from rising expenditure, \npension liabilities, and fiscal drain caused by large subsidies to loss-\nmaking public sector enterprises (PSEs).  \n \nUnder subprogram I of the AGPRM, however, various reforms were \nundertaken by the government of Assam to improve governance and \nbetter manage available resources. Through fiscal reforms, which \ninclude approval of a medium-term fiscal plan and introduction of the \nFiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act, the profile of \nfiscal imbalances has been improved and a large revenue deficit has \nbeen converted into a surplus in recent years. This was achieved \nthrough  a  combination  of  revenue  augmentation,  a  reduction  in \nrevenue losses, and closer monitoring and control of expenditure. \n \n   \nIn accordance with the AGPRM and following the reforms under \nsubprogram I, subprogram II is targeted at (i) strengthening revenue \nadministration through capacity development and implementation of ", "ii   \ninformation and communication technology systems, (ii) improving \nexpenditure  management  through  the  gradual  introduction  of \noutcome-based  budgeting  and  improvements  in  operation  and \nmaintenance expenditure estimating, (iii) developing a centralized \ndebt management system to include contingent liabilities, and (iv) \nundertaking  further  PSE  closures  and  related  compensation  and \nlabor rehabilitation. Reforms under subprogram II will allow greater \nfiscal space, thus enabling the government of Assam to allocate \nmore  fiscal  resources  to  much-needed  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure. This will, in turn, promote private sector investment, \nthus leading to income generation and higher employment.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  subprogram  II  is  to  achieve  improved  financial \nflexibility for the government of Assam so it is able to more actively \npromote social and physical infrastructure development and improve \neconomic  growth  performance.  This  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in \npoverty  in  the  state  through  better  fiscal  management  and \ngovernance. The outcomes of subprogram II are (i) increased tax \nbuoyancy via strengthened revenue administration; (ii) expenditure \nreoriented  to  allow  for  greater  allocation  for  investments  in,  and \nmaintenance of, assets; (iii) more efficient debt servicing through \nimproved  debt  management  policy  and  procedures  and  a \nstrengthened debt management unit; and (iv) accelerated closure of \nPSEs  and  implementation  of  related  compensation  and  labor \nrehabilitation. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $100 million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe Government of India will relend the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the loan to the government of Assam. The \nrelending will be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement \nfor transfer of external assistance to the government of Assam and it \nwill  be  treated  as  additional  to  the  central  government  transfers \nallocated annually to the state of Assam.  \n   \nProgram Period  Subprogram II is estimated to be completed by September 2011. \nand Tranching  The loan will be released in three tranches: (i) $40 million for the first \ntranche, (ii) $40 million for the second tranche, and (iii) $20 million \nfor  the  third  tranche.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon \nfulfillment of all agreed conditions for the first tranche and following \neffectiveness of the loan. The second tranche will be released upon \nfulfillment of all agreed conditions for the second tranche, estimated \nto be within 12 months of the first tranche release. The third tranche \nwill be released upon fulfillment of all agreed conditions for the third \n ", "  iii\ntranche, estimated to be within 18 months of the second tranche \nrelease.   \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  executing  agency  for  subprogram  II  will  be  the  Finance \nDepartment of the government of Assam.  \n   \nImplementation  A  program  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nArrangements  coordination, implementation, and monitoring of subprogram II. The \ncommittee, to be chaired by a senior official not below the rank of the \nprincipal  secretary  of  the  government  of  Assam,  will  include  all \nsecretaries of participating departments.  \n \nThe fiscal management unit in the Finance Department established \nunder subprogram I will continue to undertake fiscal management \nreforms and be responsible for daily implementation of subprogram II \nunder the guidance of the program steering committee. The fiscal \nmanagement unit will coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders \nand will solicit feedback from experts from within and outside the \ngovernment of Assam on a regular basis.  \n   \nProcurement and  The proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the foreign \nDisbursement  exchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced \nin and procured from ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans (1998), the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to \nthe Borrower.  \n   \nProgram Benefits   The benefits of subprogram II are expected to be evident in the \nfollowing: (i) the availability of more resources to invest in social and \neconomic infrastructure which should ultimately assist in enhancing \nthe welfare of the poor in the rural hinterlands, (ii) more efficient \nallocation of budget resources based on outcomes sought rather \nthan on an input-based system, and (iii) the ability of the government \nof Assam, in the long term, to place its fiscal affairs on a sounder \nfooting that can sustain investments for more rapid and inclusive \ngrowth.  \n   \nRisks and  The  success  of  subprogram  II  depends  on  the  government  of \nAssumptions  Assam\u2019s continuing strong commitment to fiscal reforms and to the \nbroader  governance  issues  of  transparency  in  fiscal  matters. \nHowever, the possibility remains that current measures and reform \nefforts,  including  insufficient  capacity  in  specific  implementing \ngovernment agencies to carry out the reforms, may not be sustained. \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) continued policy dialogue with the \ngovernment of Assam and other stakeholders in Assam (such as \nbusiness  associations),  and  (ii)  specific  technical  assistance  and \ncapacity-development  support  and  follow-up  aimed  at  the  weak \nimplementing agencies. For its part, the government of Assam has \npublicly  and  officially  (i.e.,  in  the  budget  speech)  expressed  its \n ", "iv   \ncommitment to pursue the reforms sought under subprogram II, and \nthe  level  of  engagement  in  the  program  design  has  been \nsubstantive. \n \nThe  assumptions  inherent  in  subprogram  II  are  that  (i)  the \ngovernment of Assam commitment to reforms across the various \nsectors  (including  PSEs)  will  remain  high  during  the  program \nimplementation period, (ii) existing central policies that are favorable \nto  the  government  of  Assam  will  continue  to  be  in  place  in  the \nmedium  to  long  term,  (iii)  the  greater  fiscal  space  will  result  in \nreorientation of expenditure into social and economic infrastructure, \nand (iv) any political developments that take place in the short-to-\nmedium  term  do  not  adversely  affect  subprogram  II  in  any \nsubstantive manner.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The TA will support the key government of Assam agencies that are \nimplementing  subprogram  II.  The  TA  will  also  mitigate  the  risks \nassociated  with  insufficient  capacity  in  these  agencies.  The \nestimated cost of the TA program is $750,000, of which $600,000 will \nbe a grant from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof  Japan,  and  $150,000  will  be  provided  by  the  government  of \nAssam as in-kind support. Consultants for the TA will be recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n ", " \n  I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the second subprogram (subprogram II) of the Assam Governance and Public \nResource Management Sector Development Program (AGPRM). The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for supporting subprogram II of the AGPRM. If the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Recent  Economic  Performance  in  India. The Indian economy continues to show \nimpressive growth with strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Since January 2005 the economy \nhas recorded a growth rate of over 8% in 12 successive quarters up to the end of December \n2007.  According  to  latest  estimates,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  8.7%  during \nFY2007. Average annual growth achieved during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period (2002\u20132007) \nwas 7.8%, the highest ever in any plan period. With respect to fiscal management, the tax\u2013GDP \nratio increased from 9.2% in FY2003 to 12.4% in FY2007. The Government of India continued \nprogress in terms of reduction of revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and increase in the outlays for \nseveral social sector and infrastructure development programs. However, the inflation rate in \nmid-2008 has crossed to 11% and the Indian economy is showing signs of slowing, and this \nmay have a negative impact on the collection of revenue at the central government level. \nPoverty reduction and social development through inclusive growth is the central goal of the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012), which rightly recognizes that the growth process cannot be \nsustained or made more inclusive without the supporting physical and social infrastructure. \n \n3.  Development in Assam. Assam is the largest of the seven states in northeastern India.1 \nIt has 2.5% (or 26.7 million) of India\u2019s population spread over 2.4% of the country\u2019s area. \nAssam\u2019s  development  is  of  particular  significance  as  a  gateway  for  development  of  the \nnortheast  given  both  its  relative  size  and  its  position  as  a  center  of  interstate  trade  and \nintegrated  infrastructure  in  the  northeast.  Several  structural  features  have  historically \nconstrained the economic performance of Assam. Its problems have been those of remoteness, \npartially hilly terrain, and high transportation costs. Assam is also constrained by high population \ndensity, a large but slow-growing agriculture sector, and a high incidence of poverty. In addition, \ninsurgency considerably slowed economic activity in the 1990s. All these factors contributed to \nAssam\u2019s gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate trend at constant prices during \nFY1993\u2013FY1999 remaining below 2%. With the decline in insurgency in recent years, and some \nstrong tax incentives introduced by the central government, the manufacturing and services \nsectors showed buoyant growth during FY1999\u2013FY2005, with manufacturing growing at 8.6% \nper annum and services growing by 8.0%. Led by these growth figures, the GSDP trend growth \nrate has risen to 5.4% during FY1994\u2013FY2006.2 However, due to potential slowing down of the \n                                                 \n1  These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura. \n2  In terms of compositional changes due to relatively low growth rates of agriculture, the primary sector (producing \nraw materials such as agriculture, fishing, and mining) as a whole has seen a fall in its share, whereas the share of \nthe services sector has steadily increased. The share of the primary sector fell from nearly 47% in FY1994 to 34% \nin FY2006, a fall of 13 percentage points, amounting to nearly one percentage point per year. Correspondingly, the \nshare of the tertiary sector (providing service activities such as banking, transportation, and health care) has \nincreased from 38.2% in FY1994 to 49.5% in FY2006. A significant portion of the services sector comprises trade, \nhotels and restaurants, and public administration. The increase in the share of the secondary sector (manufacturing \nbusinesses that take materials from the primary sector and other secondary businesses and make them into \ngoods) has been much less, from 14.9% in FY1994 to 17.4% in FY2006. ", "2   \nIndian economy in coming years, revenue collection by the central government may decline and \nthis may have a negative impact on the central transfers to Assam, which constitute a major \nsource of revenue for the government of Assam. \n \n4.  Against the background of the poor performance of the state economy during the 1990s, \nthe finances of the government of Assam underwent a major crisis in the late 1990s with \nrevenue deficit and fiscal deficit reaching alarming levels.3 The government of Assam finances \nhave showed a steep deterioration since FY1999. With respect to a profile of fiscal imbalance \nrelative to GSDP, in FY1999, revenue deficit relative to GSDP rose to 3.4% of GSDP from the \nposition of a surplus in the 3 preceding years. Revenue deficit continued until FY2004. The \nfiscal deficit was close to 5% of GSDP in FY2001 and remained high until FY2004. It was due to \na substantial increase in central transfers and several reform initiatives of the government of \nAssam\u2014including improved expenditure management measures\u2014that a revenue surplus and \neven a fiscal surplus were recorded in FY2005 and in FY2006. However, a fiscal deficit was \nrecorded again in FY2007 despite a surplus in the revenue account. The reemergence of fiscal \ndeficit in FY2007 was primarily attributed to a sharp increase in government investment. The \ndebt\u2013GSDP ratio of 30% in FY2007 remained higher than the overall benchmark for the debt\u2013\nGSDP ratio of 28% prescribed by the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC).4   \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n5.  Introduction. In explaining the development of the fiscal crisis in the late 1990s, it is \nnotable that Assam's finances were exposed to at least four external shocks beyond the control \nof the government of Assam. Firstly, there was the revision of salaries and pensions of central \ngovernment  employees  and  the  subsequent  near-convergence  of  pay  scales  and  other \nallowances between the center and the states, including Assam. Secondly, there was a fall in \nthe central tax\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio by nearly two percentage points during the \n1990s, leading to a fall in the government of Assam\u2019s share of central taxes.5 Thirdly, revenue \nfrom  forests  in  Assam,  which  at  one  time  was  a  mainstay  of  Assam's  nontax  resources, \ndeteriorated  sharply  after  the  Supreme  Court  judgment  banning  unplanned  felling  of  trees \nunless done according to scientific plans. Fourthly, interest rates have risen sharply since the \nmid-1990s, especially on small savings and central loans. These external pressures worked in \ncombination with critical internal weaknesses, which emanated from (i) a rise of insurgency \naffecting economic as well as fiscal performance, (ii) subdued industrial growth, (iii) the dismal \nperformance  of  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs),  and  (iv)  a  high  salary  burden  linked  to \nexcessive employment in the government of Assam. The basic mismatch in Assam's fiscal \nposition  was  reflected in  its  perennial  dependence  on  the  ways  and  means  advance  (the \nresources available to meet expenses) to get through its cash-crisis problem.6  \n                                                 \n3  Revenue deficit (surplus) is the difference between total revenue (tax revenue, nontax revenue, and share of \ncentral taxes and grants) and revenue expenditure (interest, salaries, pensions, and public sector enterprise [PSE] \nrestructuring expense). Fiscal deficit (surplus) is the difference between capital expenditure (capital outlays, loans, \nand advances) and revenue deficit (surplus). \n4  The Government of India sets up a Finance Commission on quinquennial basis to determine primarily the \ndistribution between the union and the states of the net proceeds of taxes. The commission also prescribes \nbenchmarks to reward complying states and undertakes other tasks as per the terms of reference specified by the \nGovernment of India. \n5   Due to the slowdown of the Indian economy in the 1990s, there was a fall in the central tax\u2013GDP ratio.  \n6  During the crisis period, Assam topped the list of states for the number of days of access to ways and means \nadvance in a year for several years and regularly ran an overdraft with the central bank (the Reserve Bank of \nIndia).  \n ", "  3\n6.  However,  fiscal  reforms  have  since  been  initiated  pursuant  to  the  ADB  Assam \nGovernance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  (AGPRM).7 \nUnder subprogram I of the AGPRM, reforms have led to fiscal recovery with manageable \ndeficits as a result of actions on debt restructuring and settlement, PSE closure, tax policy, and \nadministrative measures. The government of Assam is no longer resorting to ways and means \nadvances and does not run an overdraft with the Reserve Bank of India. Moreover, various \nreforms have been undertaken by the government of Assam during the subprogram I period to \nimprove governance and better manage the resources available. As part of other revenue \naugmentation reforms, in order to strengthen weaknesses in revenue collection (value-added \ntax [VAT], excise duty, motor vehicle tax, and forest produce levies), subprogram I undertook \nstrengthening  of  checkposts  at  the  main  entry  and  exit  points  on  the  trading  routes  with \nneighboring  states  and  initiated  the  establishment  of  a  composite  computerized  database. \nFurthermore, controls on budget and expenditure management have been improved to enhance \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of budget processing.8 Moreover, closure of nine PSEs and two \nunits of the Assam Small Industries Development Corporation was notified, and 50% of the \nrequired disbursement for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) has been paid to employees \nof PSEs identified for closure. Part of the explanation for the recovery is the effect of external \ninfluences. The reason for the improvement in FY2005 and in FY2006 was the increase in \ncentral fiscal transfers as directed by the recommendations of the TFC. This was combined with \nmuch higher central tax buoyancy, which helped increase the resource transfers from the center \nand, consequently, a revenue surplus was recorded in FY2005 after a long period of deficits. \nMore details have been provided in Appendix 2. \n \n7.  Fiscal Performance. After considerable deterioration in the profile of fiscal imbalances, \ngovernment finances in Assam, as shown in the levels of revenue and fiscal deficits towards the \nlatter part of the 1990s, have been recovering since FY2001. A revenue deficit of 2.64% of \nGSDP in FY2001 was converted into a surplus of 1.2% of GSDP as per FY2007 revised \nestimates.9 The fiscal deficit\u2013GSDP ratio has also been reduced from 4.33% in FY2001 to a \nsurplus of 1.09% in FY2006 and is well below permissible levels under the government of \nAssam\u2019s Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act10 (Appendix 3).  \n \n8.  These changes are due to a combination of external and internal factors. The upsurge in \nthe GSDP growth rate to levels close to 9% since FY2003, accompanied by an increase in the \nbuoyancy of central direct taxes, has been beneficial to Assam\u2019s fiscal profile. Not only has \nthere been a corresponding growth in the government of Assam\u2019s share of central taxes, but \nboth non-plan and plan grants have also been substantially increased. Also, nominal interest \nrates have declined substantially in the current decade. The debt swap initiatives in the earlier \npart of this decade, and subsequently the substantial debt relief given by the TFC effective from \nFY2005, have resulted in a reduction in the effective interest rate from 10.2% in FY1999 to 8.5% \n                                                 \n7   The loan comprises (i) a program cluster concept consisting of two back-to-back subprograms to be implemented, \n(ii) a program loan of $125 million for subprogram I, and (iii) a project loan of $25 million for capacity development \nand program implementation during the period of subprograms I and II.

Manila. \n8   On the budget and expenditure management efforts, the debt recording and management system has been put in \nplace, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure targets consistent with the updated medium-term fiscal plan \n(MTFP)  for  FY2008  have  been  approved,  two  key  management  information  systems  (MISs)  have  been \nestablished, and an inventory of central transfer schemes has been undertaken. \n9   \u201cBudget estimates\u201d refers to the approximation of the cost of an activity, program, or project, which was prepared \nfor budgeting and planning purposes only. During the following year, the budget estimates will be updated with the \nlatest information and will be called \u201crevised estimates\u201d. \n10 The FRBM Act stipulates achievement of a balance on the revenue account and a fiscal deficit of 3% by FY2009. \n ", "4   \nin FY2006. Also, the proportion of outstanding debt as a percentage of GSDP has decreased \nfrom 37.56% in FY2001 to 28.82% in FY2006. The composition of the state debt portfolio has \nalso changed, with an increasing bias towards market and institutional loans and fewer centrally \nsourced loans. \n \n9.  Factors within Assam have been equally important in improving the financial position of \nthe government of Assam. Among the several initiatives taken by the government of Assam, \nsome of the important ones relate to the enactment of the FRBM Act and sustained sales tax \nreforms leading up to the introduction of VAT. Assam\u2019s GSDP trend growth rate also picked up \nfrom less than 2% per annum during FY1993\u2013FY1999 on a trend basis to 5.4% during FY1999 \nand FY2005. Own-revenue receipts have also increased from 6.15% in FY2001 to 8.2% of \nGSDP in FY2006 despite a marginal fall in sales tax and VAT collection from 4.8% of GSDP in \nFY2004 to 4.27% in FY2006, due to the change from sales tax to VAT in FY2005.11  \n  \n10.  The government of Assam has also been successful in containing the growth of revenue \n(recurrent) expenditure due to the earlier mentioned factors of debt consolidation, swaps and \nretirement, and a virtual freeze on recruitments. There has been a decline in the revenue \nexpenditure\u2013GSDP ratio from 20% in FY2000 to 18% in FY2006. More importantly, the share of \nsalaries in revenue expenditure declined sharply from 60% to about 40% over the same period. \n \n11.  Considerable reforms have also been undertaken to put in order the affairs of the state \nPSEs. Eight PSEs were notified for closure under subprogram I of the AGPRM. In addition, the \ngovernment  of  Assam  identified  both  the  Assam  State  Electricity  Board  and  Assam  State \nTransport Corporation\u2014the two largest loss-generating enterprises\u2014for reform and operational \nrestructuring. There has been staff rationalization and public\u2013private partnership initiatives in the \nAssam State Transport Corporation; the Assam State Electricity Board is in the process of being \nunbundled and corporatized. \n \n12.  The results of all these efforts and changes are reflected in a reduction of the revenue \ndeficit from the peak of 3.4% of GSDP to less than 1% by FY2004, and a revenue surplus in the \nsubsequent years up to FY2007 (revised estimate). The challenges for the government of \nAssam are to sustain this trend and achieve at least a balance on the revenue account by \nFY2008 to meet the FRBM Act targets. The sustainability of the recent fiscal performance \nrequires continued emphasis on some areas as described in the following paragraphs. The \ncurrent  achievements  in  fiscal  performance  are  due  to  one-time  corrections,12 and  the \nadvantages accruing from these corrections could be lost if fiscal prudence is not maintained, or \nthrough exposure to risks such as spikes in salaries due to implementation of salary increases \nfollowing the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. \n \n13.  Central  Transfers.  It  was  due  to  a  substantial  increase  in  fiscal  transfers  that,  in \nFY2005, a revenue surplus and even a small fiscal surplus were recorded. However, formula-\nbased fiscal transfers to the states depend on the nominal national GDP growth rate. Any \ndecline in the growth rate will have an adverse impact on transfers to the states. Given Assam\u2019s \ndependence on central transfers, this has the potential to destabilize fiscal consolidation. Thus, \nmobilizing higher revenue from own sources is imperative to maintaining the pace of fiscal \nconsolidation in the state.   \n                                                 \n11 Sales tax was levied until FY2004 and from 1 April 2005 (from FY2005) onwards, it has been replaced by VAT. \n12  Revenue has been positively impacted by (i) the introduction of VAT, which has led to an increase in the tax base, \n(ii) reduced interest outgoings due to consolidation of Government of India loans following the enactment of the \nFRBM Act, (iii) arrested salary expenditure growth through checks on recruitments, and (iv) limits on subsidies to \nPSEs with the closure of inoperative PSEs.  \n ", "  5\n14.  Tax Revenue. The government of Assam\u2019s tax\u2013GSDP ratio continues to improve, and \nreached 6.2% in FY2004. In the following 2 years, the tax\u2013GSDP ratio experienced a marginal \nfall due to the impact of the introduction of VAT. However, it has remained higher than in all \nprevious years. The government of Assam needs to sustain key reforms in the areas of tax \nadministration to improve tax compliance. It is essential for Assam to develop an efficient \nsystem for managing and administering its own tax revenue in order to benefit from the rise in \neconomic activity. Improving own tax yields are important because that will enable Assam to \nobtain some measure of fiscal independence from the central government.  \n \n15.  Nontax Revenue. Nontax revenue relative to GSDP, which was close to 1% until 1998\u2013\n1999, has also risen continuously and it was estimated at 2.6% of GSDP in FY2006. With \ngrowing oil prices, ad valorem petroleum royalties will continue to be the largest contributor to \nnontax revenue from economic services; they have been gradually strengthening the nontax \nrevenue  share.  Nontax  revenue  has  reasonable  scope  for  augmentation  provided  a  link \nbetween costs and recoveries is established. Among the social services, medical, public health, \nand  family  welfare  provide  the  largest  share  of  nontax  revenue.  Secondary  education \ncontributes most of the fees collected in education.  \n \n16.  Dependence on Central Fiscal Transfers. In spite of the continuously improving own-\nrevenue performance, the dependence of Assam on central transfers has always been large. In \nFY2005, following the recommendations of the TFC, central transfers amounted to 12.8% of \nGSDP, and were estimated at nearly 17.7% of GSDP in FY2006 due to a rise in the share of \ncentral taxes and a steep rise in the plan grants. \n \n17.  Expenditure. Total government expenditure relative to GSDP may be considered as an \nindicator of the size of government. There was a discernible declining trend in government \nexpenditure as a percentage of GSDP in Assam up to FY1998. Since then, there has been an \nincrease in total expenditure relative to GSDP. Based on sharp increases in plan assistance, 2 \nrecent years show significant increases. After falling in the mid-1990s, revenue expenditure \nstarted rising after FY1996, reaching close to 20% of GSDP in FY1999. It remained roughly at \nthis level up until FY2001. There was a small fall in FY2002, it again rose in FY2003 and \nFY2004, before falling again to around 17%\u201318% in FY2005 and FY2006. Some important \nfeatures on the expenditure side relate to the rising share of committed expenditures such as \ninterest payments, pensions, and salaries, and a low and stagnant share of capital expenditure \nin total expenditure. Interest payment peaked at 3.6% of GSDP in FY2002 but since then it has \nfallen based on the softening of the interest rate and relief due to the center\u2019s debt swap \nprogram. Pensions rose steadily up to FY2004, accounting for 2.43% of GSDP. A reversal in \nthis trend is essential for promoting growth and fiscal consolidation, which would in turn require \nsustaining key reforms in areas such as staff rationalization, pension reform, debt restructuring, \nand expenditure management. \n \n18.  Asset-forming government expenditure, such as capital outlay and net lending, steadily \ndeclined after the mid-1990s but has shown improvement in the current decade. The share of \ncapital outlay and loans and advances steadily declined due to a sharp increase in the share of \nrepayment obligations of the government of Assam for repayment of loans and advances from \nthe central government.  \n \n19.  Debt. With regard to the composition of loans, within a span of 6 years (from FY2000 to \nFY2005), the share of market loans in total debt has risen from nearly 23% to 38%, whereas the \nshare  of  central  loans  has  fallen  from  64%  in  FY1998  to  25.8%  in  FY2005.  With  the \nrecommendation  of  the  TFC  regarding  disintermediation  of  state  loans  by  the  central \n ", "6   \ngovernment, the states are expected to approach market loan sources and, therefore, central \nloans are expected to have a smaller share in Assam\u2019s debt profile, and most of them will be \nconsolidated debt following the TFC\u2019s recommendations. \n \n20.  Public  Sector  Enterprises.  The  PSEs  have  historically  been  a  fiscal  drag  on  the \ngovernment of Assam\u2019s finances. There are 48 PSEs in Assam, of which 33 are corporations, \neight are cooperatives, and seven are statutory bodies. The PSEs have historically been known \nfor  not  keeping  up-to-date  audited  accounts.  For  example,  at  the end  of  March  2004,  no \ninformation was available for 15 PSEs and there was some information but no audited accounts \nfor 14 PSEs. Thus, for 60% of the PSEs, the reliance on available financial information has \nbeen limited. Of the remaining 19 PSEs, 15 had provisional accounts and there were only four \nPSEs where audited accounts were available. \n \n21.  Fiscal Discipline. The government of Assam has enacted the FRBM Act stipulating \nlimitations on the levels of deficit for the state finances, with the targets being 3% fiscal deficit \nand  a  revenue  balance  by  FY2008  following  the  TFC  stipulated  targets.  Accordingly,  the \ngovernment of Assam\u2019s Medium-Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) presents a fiscal profile that shows a \nrevenue  surplus  being  generated  throughout  the  period  from  FY2007  budget  estimates  to \nFY2011 projections. The fiscal deficit relative to GSDP shows a continuous decline from 3.16% \nin FY2007 to 2.28% in FY2011. In both cases, the targets stipulated by the TFC are projected to \nbe met. The only features of the MTFP that may cause some concern are that capital outlay as \na percentage of GSDP is shown to be falling over time and the debt\u2013GSDP ratio has exceeded \n37% of GSDP.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n22.  The  issues  faced  in  public  resource  management  in  Assam  are  multifaceted.  An \nassessment of the various aspects of public resource management and the experiences under \nsubprogram I have identified that lack of financial flexibility has been impacted by several \nvariables.  Key  ones  that  are  relevant  to  the  proposed  subprogram  II  include  (i)  revenue \nadministration, (ii) expenditure management, (iii) debt management, and (iv) PSE reforms.  \n \n1.  Revenue Administration \n \n23.  In the revenue departments, the first major issue involves the constraint of human \nresources, particularly that of recruitment of operating staff and provision for regular training and \ncapacity building of staff. The second issue, related to the first issue, has been the lack of a \nmechanism  to  facilitate  the  periodic  intensive  exposure  of  the  operating  staff  to  modern \npractices adopted by what are considered to be more advanced states in India. The third issue \nis that of underfunding for the modernization of the revenue administration departments, not \nonly in terms of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) facilities but \neven of renewal of basic facilities, to enable more efficient revenue administration. Issues \nspecific to major sources of revenue are described below.  \n \n  a.  Value-Added Tax \n \n24.  The number of registered VAT dealers has grown phenomenally to around 82,300 as of \nSeptember 2007.13 Assuming 50% of them are required to file monthly returns, the total number \n                                                 \n13 As VAT is a self-assessment based tax, the increase in the number of registered dealers for VAT is a good \nparameter to judge compliance leading to an increase in tax base and revenue collection. \n ", "  7\nof such returns, to be handled by about 220 superintendents and inspectors positioned in the \ncircles and units (i.e., excluding those in the office of the commissioner of commercial tax and at \ncheckposts), would be about 41,000, i.e., over 180 returns per person per month and another \n60-plus returns per quarter. Since VAT is a self-assessment tax, the role of audit becomes \ncrucial. The filing and auditing of such a large number of returns is currently an unmanageable \nload. \n \n25.  The Commercial Tax Department has so far focused primarily on making the VAT \nsystem operational in the face of organizational and other constraints. As a result, dealers\u2019 \neducation on the features of the new tax and associated matters like proactive and widespread \nassistance to facilitate compliance has not attracted as much attention as it deserves. It may be \nmentioned, though, that some publicity campaigns are being organized by the department. The \ngovernment of Assam has, however, put in place an institutional consultative forum, headed by \nthe commissioner and principal secretary of taxation of the Finance Department, which has as \nmembers representatives of various industry associations. It can be a useful mechanism to \ndevise measures based on websites and other media and make them operational to fill this \nconspicuous gap quickly. \n \n26.  The  tax  information  management  system  (TIMS)  has  been  installed  and  made \nfunctional. However, the system faces some issues with respect to performance of application \nsoftware, which is proving to be a bottleneck in the full functioning of the TIMS. Five modules of \nthe TIMS have been made functional: registration, returns, payments, a checkpost-geographical \ninformation  system,  and  statutory  form  modules.  There  are  several  other  modules  in  the \nsystems that are still to be made functional. Since the development of the TIMS was undertaken \nwhen  the  sales  tax  regime  existed,  there  is  a  requirement  for  redesign  of  the  forms  and \ndevelopment of an audit module that was not developed earlier. Online data entry and validation \nof past tax returns in the TIMS is facing a backlog due to the high system response time. \n \nb.  Excise Tax \n \n27.  The excise commissioner\u2019s office and the field formations in districts and circles have \nneither undergone any reorganization nor do they have any improved mobility (transport facility) \nor even rudimentary computer facilities. Most routine functions, including typewriting, are still \ncarried out manually in the commissioner\u2019s office as well as in the field offices. Under such a \nscenario,  even  if  the  ICT-based  management  information  system  (MIS)  at  the  composite \ncheckposts becomes fully operational for excise functions, the absence of suitable ICT support \nfacilities and connectivity in the offices of the commissioner and the district superintendents \nmeans that the enforcement database of the checkposts would not be utilized optimally in these \noffices.  \n \n28.  The second issue with respect to excise is that of the basic structure of the excise duty \non India-made foreign liquor (IMFL)14 and country spirits. Excise revenue has been generally \nstagnant, though its potential for growth is considerable. The replacement of the existing fixed \nlicense fee system in respect of country spirits, as envisaged in subprogram I, has been notified. \nAs a next step, the notification will need to be implemented through auctioning of new country \nspirit shop licenses. The government of Assam notification was issued in November 2006 to \nadopt the system of auctioning the retail outlets of country spirits instead of fixed license fee-\nbased tendering. Accordingly, the auction system is expected to become operational. The \n                                                 \n14 India-made foreign liquors, such as whisky and vodka, are different from India-made country liquor (licensed \ndistilled spirits made locally). \n ", "8   \ngovernment has moved to an ad valorem excise duty structure on IMFL with a consequent \nincrease in excise duty collection of 11% in 2006.  According to the Excise Department, a \nproposal for levy of ad valorem duty on IMFL was submitted to the government of Assam in \nOctober 2006 under subprogram I. \n  \nc.  Stamp Duty and Registration Fees \n \n29.  Stamp duty and registration fees are comparatively simpler and they are suited to quick \nand simple technological solutions. The manual process of registration of properties and the \nnon-objective valuation method of properties at the time of property transactions give large \nscope  for  missed  revenue  collection.  The  introduction  of  ICT-driven  extensive  process \nreengineering in both the objective valuation method (OVM) of land records and registration of \nproperty transactions can bring about sustainable improvement in revenue collection as well as \nefficient and transparent service delivery to users by way of immediate provision of registration \ndocuments, which currently takes a long time. One of the issues with adopting technology for \nOVM and registration of properties is that of uploading the available manually recorded sales \ndata. It is contained in the poorly maintained bulky records of the stamps and registration unit of \nthe land records directorate as well as in district and sub-registrars' offices. \n \n2.  Expenditure Management \n \n30.  The key issue in expenditure management is the rising share of committed expenditure \nsuch as interest payments, pensions, and salaries, and the low and falling share of capital \nexpenditure among total expenditure. This is in the context of a situation where Assam, with its \nspecial  category  state  status.15 Expenditure  on  salaries  and  pensions  is  vulnerable  to  the \nimpending central Sixth Pay Commission. There is a possibility of a sudden increase in revenue \nexpenditure due to higher salary scales following the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. \nThis  could  jeopardize  Assam\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  initiatives,  leading  to  a  drop  in  capital \nexpenditure. \n \n31.  To further rationalize expenditure management, the government of Assam is introducing \noutcome-based  budgeting  (OBB).  The  government  has  realized  that,  given  the  present \ndominance of input-based line-item budgeting, OBB will have to be introduced in a phased \nmanner. As an important first step, 10 departments have been instructed to prepare their budget \nestimates  for  FY2009  around  specified  outputs,  rather  than  inputs.  Over  the  course  of \nsubprogram II, TA will be provided to take this process further and establish a proper OBB \nprocess, including ex-ante alignment with the budget classification and codification system.16 \nUnder  subprogram  II,  the  government  of  Assam  will  issue  guidelines  for  OBB  and  will \nsubsequently pilot the implementation of these guidelines in a departmental scheme. \n \n3.  Debt Management \n \n32.  The responsibility for government borrowing, debt recording, debt servicing, accounting \nfor  debt  transactions  and  overall  debt  management\u2014including  government  onlending  and \nguarantees\u2014is scattered across several government agencies. This makes it very difficult to \n                                                 \n15 The ratio of grant\u2013loan composition of assistance will be given by the Planning Commission for the special \ncategory states. \n16 Budget classification is currently done by means of an ex-post analysis of endorsed budgets (by the State \nDirectorate of Economics and Statistics) and distinguishes between administrative, economic, and purpose (or \nfunctional) classification. Ex-ante alignment with budget nomenclature will be introduced as part of the OBB \nprocess.   \n ", "  9\nsystematically analyze government debt and associated risks. The government does not have \nthe skills in the Finance Department for efficient debt management. This becomes more critical \nin an efficient public financial management system, which is a key ingredient for sustained fiscal \nconsolidation.17 It is thus a high-priority area for the state governments to consider towards their \ncapacity building for debt management, including external debt management. \n \n4.  Public Sector Enterprises \n \n33.  The government of Assam extends guarantees for loans taken by a number of PSEs \nand cooperative institutions. Given the financial performance of these enterprises, many of \nthese guarantees in the form of contingent liabilities have the potential of becoming actual \nbudgetary liabilities. In many cases, the debt incurred by the concerned agency has not been \nserviced, so that outstanding liabilities have mounted as a result of unpaid repayments as well \nas unpaid interest liabilities. As of 2007, out of the total guaranteed loan of Rs15 billion, nearly \nRs13 billion remain outstanding liabilities in terms of repayments and interest due. \n \n34.  There are several inoperative, or almost inoperative, PSEs in Assam. However, due to \nthe non-notification of closure of such PSEs, the salary and statutory dues to the employees \nhave  been  accumulating  and  these  ultimately  devolve  to  the  government  of  Assam.  The \ngovernment of Assam has notified closure of eight PSEs under subprogram I and plans to notify \nmore PSEs for closure to stop the accumulation of liabilities. The notification ensures effective \nfinancial closure of the PSEs. However, achieving the legal closure of the PSEs will be time-\nconsuming as the accounts of the PSEs are not up to date and statutory audit of accounts are \npending for several years. \n \n  5.  Buoyant Economic Growth \n \n35.  The higher tax revenues for the state and central governments are the result of high \ngrowth rates of GDP nationally and in Assam. The higher tax revenues for the Government also \ntranslate into larger central transfers to the government of Assam. This provides an opportunity \nfor the government of Assam to increase investments in social and physical infrastructure, \nwhich could possibly lead to attracting private investments into Assam. This, in turn, could lead \nto further economic growth, greater tax revenues, and peace, thus putting Assam into a cycle of \ngrowth and development.  \n \n  6.  Government of Assam Strategy \n  \n36.  The  government  of  Assam\u2019s  strategy  emphasizes  placing  its  public  finances  on  a \nsustainable path and improving governance to enable higher levels of investment on critical \nsocial and physical infrastructure, thus strengthening the prospects for sustained economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. Sustained high growth depends crucially on the creation of fiscal \nresources for additional public investment.18 The government of Assam has assured that the \nreforms  under  subprogram  II  will  sustain  the  development  momentum  initiated  under \nsubprogram I. The government of Assam is also taking various steps as facilitator for the \ndevelopment of industries and commerce in Assam. Against this background the government is \n                                                 \n17 There is a change in the policy of the Government of India whereby states have been allowed to obtain loans \ndirectly from multilateral and bilateral sources rather than receive the proceeds through an Indian rupee loan from \nthe central government. \n18  In line with its strategy, the government of Assam signed the memorandum on the medium-term fiscal reform with \nthe  Government  in  March  2003,  thereby  indicating  its  commitment  to  a  medium-term  strategy  for  fiscal \nconsolidation.   \n ", "10  \ntaking  all  possible  steps  to  attract  investments  in  infrastructure  (including  roads,  ICT,  and \ntourism-related facilities), and is attempting to make Assam a regional hub of industrial activity \nin the northeast. Schemes like the New Industrial Policy, 2003, are being implemented to \nencourage entrepreneurs by providing various investment incentives. With continued support \nfrom the Government to apply earlier patterns of loan proceeds of externally aided project to \nAssam,19 the government of Assam is accelerating its efforts to avail itself of assistance of other \nmultilateral donors, including World Bank assistance for the public works department roads \nproject20 and ADB assistance for flood mitigation and financial sector reforms.    \n \n  7.  ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  2003\u20132006  for  India21 was  the  first \noperational strategy proposed for India after the adoption of ADB's poverty reduction strategy in \n1999 and its incorporation into the long- and medium-term strategic frameworks.22 There have \nsince been two updates to the strategy\u2014CSP update 2005\u20132007 and CSP update 2006\u2013\n2008.23 Mainstreaming poverty reduction is the central organizing theme of the most recent \nstrategy.  \n \n38.  The most important challenge facing the achievement of high growth is that of a major \nfiscal turnaround. ADB assistance for fiscal consolidation has been provided to focal states such \nas Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. In the new CSP, assistance for fiscal policy \nreforms,  improved  tax  administration,  and  other  fiscal  management  measures  of  the  state \ngovernments will be significantly strengthened. Another important strategic priority in the new \nCSP is governance, which cuts across all other components of the strategy. Good governance \nwill considerably enhance the total developmental impact of ADB's assistance program. In the \ncase  of  Assam,  state-level  fiscal  policy  reforms  have  been  emphasized,  and  these  are \ncombined with interventions to strengthen state governments to ensure greater accountability, \ntransparency, and efficiency in service delivery, especially for pro-poor services. \n \n  8.  Lessons  \n \n39.  Subprogram II has been designed in light of some important recommendations put forth \nby ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department in its special evaluation studies on ADB Support to \nPublic  Resource  Management  in  India  and  Policy-Based  Lending:  Emerging  Practices  in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries.24 Moreover, subprogram II has benefited \nfrom  A  Comparative  Assessment  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Public  Resource \nManagement Reform Programs.25 The design of subprogram II takes into consideration lessons \n                                                 \n19 The loan proceeds of externally aided projects were transferred by the central government to the special category \nstates as 90% grant and 10% loan. Under the Twelfth Finance Commission award, the Government decided to \ncontinuously apply the same assistance pattern to these special category states including Assam. \n20 Appendix 4 provides the development coordination matrix. \n21 ADB. 2003.

Effective and viable political economy analysis is required to \nimprove reform design and risk-mitigation measures. Accordingly, a risk-mitigation analysis has \nbeen conducted in order to identify key political economy factors, how to address their impact \non the reform program, and how to mitigate related risks\u2014such as low capacity of relevant \nagencies, weak internal accountability mechanisms, and risks related to PSEs\u2014during program \nimplementation.   \n \n40.  There  is  a  sequence  to  reforms,  and  the  cascade  of  legislation\u2013institutions\u2013\norganization\u2013people  provides  a  strategic  sequence  for  reforms.  Subprogram  II  has  been \ndesigned in line with subprogram I, which has shown progress in legislative and regulatory \nreforms as well as capacity building of government and related institutions. As subprogram I is \nsequenced,  subprogram  II  will  focus  on  actual  implementation  of  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram I.26  A coherent application of design tools\u2014such as the policy matrix, the design \nand monitoring framework, and the poverty impact assessment matrix\u2014is needed to achieve \ndevelopment  results.  Subprogram  II  pays  attention  to  developing  realistic  development \noutcomes and outputs, and ensures consistency among these design tools to forge the basis for \nbetter monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n41.  For sustainable reforms, there is a need to develop capacities\u2014including management, \nleadership, facilitation, and conflict resolution competencies\u2014for better institutional and human \ncapacity building. Subprogram II is to be complemented by an attached TA program, which is \ndesigned to provide technical support in the areas of (i) capacity development of government \nofficials  and  related  stakeholders  to  undertake  identified  areas,  including  revenue \nadministration, debt and expenditure management, and PSE reform; and (ii) institutional and \nhuman  resources  capacity  development  including  management,  leadership,  facilitation, \nnegotiation, and conflict resolution competencies. For efficient training of large numbers of \nofficials,  trained  consultants  will  be  mobilized  to  conduct  training  programs  in  the  field  in \njuxtaposition with training through designated local training institutions with curriculum designed \nfor client-oriented trainings. In summary, the components of the TA have been designed to help \ngovernment officials and related stakeholders to be better equipped with general management \ncompetencies as well as technical knowledge upgrading in specific fiscal management issues. \n \n  9.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n \n42.  Due to the magnitude of fiscal governance issues across all the state governments in \nIndia, ADB\u2019s intervention in Assam through the AGPRM should be viewed as part of a larger \nstrategy involving multiple development partners to address the issue of deficits leading to \nconstrained  investments  in  social  and  physical  infrastructure  in  the  less  advanced  states. \nSubprogram II draws from the lessons of development that states like Andhra Pradesh and \nKarnataka have experienced through strengthening of their public resource management and \ngovernance systems over the past decade. Development partners are active in India in the area \nof fiscal governance reforms (Appendix 4) and areas of support have included \n \n(i)  making delivery institutions more accountable; \n(ii)  sustainable development through poverty reduction, private sector development, \nhealth, basic education, equality between women and men, and environmental \nsustainability; \n                                                 \n26 Appendix 6 has details on the sequence between subprograms I and II. \n ", "12  \n(iii)  public  financial  management  including  budget  reforms  in  state  finance \ndepartments as well as line agencies; \n(iv)  introduction of medium-term expenditure frameworks in state governments; \n(v)  support to outcome-based budgeting; \n(vi)  decentralization  and  assistance  for  procurement  services  for  modernizing \ngovernment and fiscal reforms; \n(vii)  tax administration reforms; and  \n(viii)  computerization of treasuries and other financial management as well as tax \nadministration processes. \n \n43.  Coordination among development partners in these and other activities is done through \ncentral processing of all external assistance by the Department of Economic Affairs in the \nGovernment, as well as through consultation between the ADB India Resident Mission and the \nother funding agencies in India. The level of coordination existing among the development \npartners with respect to subprogram II is evident in support from the Government and the ADB \nmission  through  readiness  to  provide  funds  for  preparation  and  successful  execution  of \nsubprogram II. \n \n  10.  Rationale \n \n44.  Under subprogram I, various reforms were undertaken by the government of Assam to \nimprove governance and better manage available resources. Through fiscal reforms, including \napproval of an MTFP and introduction of the FRBM Act, the profile of fiscal imbalances was \nimproved and a large revenue deficit has been converted into a surplus in recent years. The \nefforts towards revenue augmentation have included introducing VAT in 2005, broadening the \ntax base, and introducing an ad valorem excise duty structure on IMFL with a consequent \nincrease in excise duty collection of 11% in 2006. For increasing revenue collection in areas \nsuch as VAT, excise duty, motor vehicle tax, and forest produce levies, subprogram I reform \nmeasures introduced composite checkposts at the main entry and exit points on the trading \nroutes with neighboring states, which led to cross-verification of information as well as reduced \nstoppage time for the trucks at the checkposts.  \n \n45.  With regard to debt and expenditure, the debt recording and management system was \nput in place, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure targets consistent with the updated \nMTFP were approved, and two key MISs were established. Moreover, closure of eight PSEs \nwas notified and 50% of the required compensation disbursement for the VRS was paid to \nemployees of PSEs identified for closure. \n \n46.  Despite  reforms  attained  under  subprogram  I,  given  the  fiscal  pressure  that  the \ngovernment of Assam is still facing due to an increase in the pension bill and impending \nimplementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, the rationale of subprogram II \nis contained in the urgent need to concentrate on reform initiatives in the areas of (i) increasing \ntax  revenue  via  strengthened  revenue  administration  through  capacity  building  and \nimplementation  of  ICT-based  systems;  (ii) improving  expenditure  management  through  the \ngradual introduction of outcome-based budgeting, O&M expenditure estimating, and additional \nclosure of loss-generating PSEs; and (iii) developing a centralized debt management system to \ninclude contingent liabilities. The program reforms will allow greater fiscal space, thus enabling \nthe government of Assam to allocate more resources to much-needed social and economic \ninfrastructure. This will, in turn, promote private sector investment, thus leading to income \ngeneration and higher employment. Moreover, given that youth unemployment has historically \n ", "  13\nbeen a major contributor to social unrest in Assam, creating greater fiscal space will help to \nresolve the unrest problem.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n47.  The fiscal reforms embarked upon under subprogram I have put state finances on a \npositive path of increased revenue, controlled expenditure, debt restructuring leading to optimal \ndebt servicing costs, and limiting the fiscal drain on state finances of PSEs. The design of \nsubprogram II is based on the lessons learned during subprogram I, the current fiscal situation \nin Assam, areas of policy progress where the implementation of policies needs to be pursued, \nand key implementation-oriented actions that will lead to tangible improvements in areas of \nrevenue administration, expenditure and debt management, and PSE financial closure.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n48.  The proposed subprogram II is in keeping with national and international experience and \nthe government of Assam\u2019s own stated outcomes on good fiscal management in its FRBM Act. \nThe impact of subprogram II is to achieve improved financial flexibility of the government of \nAssam through controlled deficits and better fiscal management. It is expected to contribute to \neconomic growth through greater investments in social and economic infrastructure, leading to \nemployment opportunities and ultimately social peace and harmony.  \n \n49.  The policy actions supported by subprogram II will lead to the consolidation of fiscal \nreforms in order to further improve the fiscal position of the government of Assam, as reflected \nin  the  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix  5).  The  key  end-of-program \noutcomes will include (i) increased tax revenues as a result of efficient revenue administration; \n(ii) expenditures prioritized to allow greater allocation for investments in, and maintenance of, \nassets;  (iii)  savings  in  debt  servicing  costs as  a  result  of  strengthened  debt management \ncapacities and consolidated policy procedures; and (iv) better mitigation of fiscal risk originating \nfrom selected loss-generating PSEs and further steps towards financial closure and initiation of \nthe legal closure process for PSEs notified for closure by getting the statutory audits completed \nand initiating liquidation of assets.  \n \n50.  These outcomes will be reflected in, and monitored through, \n \n(i)  continued  adherence  to  deficit  targets  prescribed  in  the  FRBM  Act  beyond \nFY2008, and possibly a surplus on the revenue account; \n(ii)  progressively improving own revenue\u2013GSDP ratio; \n(iii)  progressively increasing investments in assets as a percentage of GSDP; \n(iv)  stable debt servicing cost to GSDP ratio; and  \n(v)  progressively  reducing  budgetary  support  for  PSEs  and  reduced  contingent \nliabilities  on  account  of  guarantees  issued  by  the  government  of  Assam  for \nborrowings by the PSEs. \n \nB.  Outputs  \n \n51.  To  achieve  the  outcomes  described,  the  government  of  Assam  has  declared  and \nexhibited political commitment to undertake fiscal reforms for sustainable fiscal balance through \nrationalization of its exposure to PSEs, tax policy and administration reforms, and continued \nimproved expenditure management by adopting the defined contribution pension scheme and \n ", "14  \nlimiting public sector recruitment. Subprogram II will support the achievement of results in the \nfollowing four areas.27 \n \n1.  Component 1: Efficient Revenue Administration \n \n52.  Under subprogram I, the principal objectives in the area of revenue administration were \nbroadening  the  tax  base  (through  transparent  and  efficient  implementation  of  taxes)  and \nenhancing revenue collection (through institutional measures to check leakages and evasion). \nUnder  subprogram  II,  the  focus  will  be  on  strengthening  the  tax  administration  processes \nthrough implementation of ICT-based systems and actual implementation of policy measures \nadopted under subprogram I. The key outputs being targeted under the revenue administration \noutcome are given in the following paragraphs.   \n \n53.  Value-Added Tax. Multi-point, destination-based ad valorem VAT, in lieu of the Assam \ngeneral sales tax, was introduced by the government of Assam in May 2005 along with other \nstates  in  the  country,  as  a  result  of  a  consensus  forged  among  the  states  with  active \ninvolvement of the Government. In terms of broadening the tax base of sales or VAT, the \nnumber of registered dealers in Assam increased from about 48,000 in March 2005 (the first \nyear of subprogram I) to about 75,860 in March 2007, and 82,300 in September 2007. The audit \nof  VAT  returns  assumes  greater  importance  in  a  VAT  regime  as  VAT  is  based  on  self-\nassessment. With the limited experience of tax administration officials in undertaking audits, \ncombined with the increase in the number of registered dealers and consequent larger number \nof tax files, addressing this issue assumes importance. The proposed program will need to \naddress the issues of (i) instituting standardized procedures for VAT audits, (ii) moving towards \nelectronic tax filing to address the problem of entering large number of returns in the TIMS, and \n(iii) greater focus on servicing and auditing large taxpayers who contribute the majority of VAT \nrevenue. In addition, reforms in VAT implementation will need to be harmonized with the goods \nand services tax, scheduled to be introduced in April 2010, without major modification to existing \nprocedures and applications.  \n \n54.  Subprogram II will thus support finalization and implementation of an audit manual28 for \nVAT that will provide (i) a standardized tool for undertaking audits by tax administration officials, \nand (ii) criteria for selection of tax files to be audited. It will also support changes in the tax filing \nrequirements to ease the burden of the number of tax returns to be entered into the TIMS as \nwell as allowing tax administration officials to focus on larger taxpayers. A large taxpayer unit \nwill be set up, on a pilot basis, to focus on the small number of large taxpayers who contribute \nthe majority of the taxes.  \n \n55.  The ICT-based TIMS was introduced during subprogram I. The systems requirement \nspecifications and application software of the TIMS, on which the main operational modules \nwere developed, were, however, predicated on the sales tax regime. Moreover, more modules \nwill  need  to  be  updated  in  order  to  improve  the  functionality  of  the  TIMS.  The  greatest \n                                                 \n27  The outputs and performance targets of subprogram II are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n28 The VAT Act provides for submission of periodic returns by registered dealers and these returns are crucial in a \nself-assessed tax regime. The audit manual will include (i) period of the returns based on an assessment of the tax \nyield of individual bands of dealers, (ii) quick audit of all returns with some objectives (e.g., timely submission \nreturns including non-filer and stop-filer classification, calculation accuracy including application of correct rates, \ndeviations from past trends of reported taxable turnover, and input tax credit claims; (iii) determination of risks \nassociated with specific business activities and dealer profiles. and (v) distribution of the audit functions among the \nfield and headquarters staff. \n ", "  15\nimplementation efforts to be supported by subprogram II will be upgrading of TIMS to enable, \namong other things, the following: \n \n(i)  upgrading the system, keeping in view the impending implementation of the \ngoods and services tax regime; \n(ii)  e-filing of VAT returns; \n(iii)  e-filing of motor vehicle data; \n(iv)  interfacing  between  TIMS  and  the  computerized  treasury  management \ninformation system; \n(v)  making  an  audit  module  in  the  TIMS  operational,  including  completion  of \nhistorical return data entry; and \n(vi)  providing online taxpayer services. \n \n56.  Excise  Tax.  Among  the  constraints  affecting  excise  duty  in  Assam,  subprogram  I \nhighlighted those flowing from inadequacy of border controls, the system of specific levies on \nIMFL based on a wide range of administrative parameters (such as brand and strength), and \nomnipresent departmental controls on production, transport, and retail outlets under a system of \nfixed vendor and license fees for country spirits. It is clear that the emphasis on border controls \nwas based primarily on the reported lower rates of excise duties on similar varieties of liquor in \nneighboring states. \n \n57.  The policy matrix of subprogram I and actions therein stipulated the commitment of the \ngovernment of Assam to include, in the approved revenue policy guidelines, excise policy \nreforms by way of alternative methods of levy and collection of excise duties. This was to be \nfollowed by legislative changes to convert specific excise duties on IMFL to ad valorem levies, \nand to similarly replace the fixed fee licenses with an alternative method of collection of excise \nduties on country spirits. In terms of implementation of these reforms, the government of Assam \nmodified the rules relating to excise duty rates on IMFL in September 2005 and prescribed \nspecific rates of duty based on normative cost brands for IMFL. In respect of reforms in the duty \nregime and collection methods for country spirits, it is understood that the government of Assam \nhas notified an auction-based system for awarding licenses of country spirit shops. With regard \nto border control, composite checkposts have been notified at three locations,29 which are \nreported to have provided surveillance of excisable goods. \n \n58.  In view of the government of Assam\u2019s auction-based system for awarding licenses of \ncountry spirit shops, subprogram II will support the government of Assam in ensuring that the \nauctions adhere to generally accepted levels of transparency and accountability. In particular, \nthe TA will support the government of Assam in preparing the framework and guidelines for \nthese auctions based on best practices. Subprogram II also supports the implementation of an \nad valorem duty structure for IMFL on a percentage basis on the maximum retail price in order \nto continuously address the issue of loss of revenue due to price movements.  \n \n59.  Stamp  Duty,  Registration  Fees,  and  Land  Revenue.  In  subprogram  I,  it  was \nhighlighted that the stamp duty and registration fees have not grown commensurately with the \nincreasing land values in Assam. It identified the underlying cause as being the system of \nvaluation of properties transacted and the associated high rates of duty that result in heavy \n                                                 \n29  During subprogram I, the government of  Assam notified composite  checkposts in Boxirhat, Digarkhal, and \nSrirampur. These checkposts are designed to enable the departments of excise, forest, transport, and taxation to \ncheck vehicles entering Assam at one place. Transporters save considerable time, tax collection becomes efficient, \nand interdepartmental coordination is facilitated. \n ", "16  \nundervaluation and consequent loss of revenue. The policy measures under subprogram I thus \nrequired the government of Assam to (i) approve and notify the use of OVM for properties, (ii) \nestablish valuation committees chaired by deputy commissioners of districts, and (iii) establish \nthe basis for the use of OVM.30 As the next step, preparatory work will be required before OVM \nis actually put into practice. The presently notified policy guidelines on OVM will need to be \ndefined with (i) the specific modalities of valuation, (ii) state oversight of the process, and (iii) \nharmonization of possible local (district-level) variations in the application of the methodology. \n \n60.  Subprogram  II,  thus,  focuses  on  the  preparatory  work  required  for  making  OVM \nfunctional. As  a  key  requirement  to  implementing  OVM,  subprogram  II  will  (i)  support  the \ncomprehensive computerization of land records in 21 districts (i.e., all Assam districts except the \ndistricts  under  autonomous  councils),  and  (ii)  computerization  of  the  property  registration \nprocess for the same 21 districts in the sub-registrars\u2019 offices. It will also support the preparation \nof  guidelines  at  the  central  level  for  OVM.  By  the  end  of  the  program  period,  a  pilot \ncomputerized  OVM  operation  in  at  least  one  sub-registrar\u2019s  office  will  be  in  place,  thus \neliminating human intervention in the valuation of properties for registration. This is expected to \n(i) lead to greater revenue realization by way of stamp duty and registration fees, as well as \nenhancement  of  transparency  and  governance;  and  (ii)  provide  a  basis  for  replicating  the \noperation into other sub-registrar\u2019s offices.  \n \n61.  Composite Checkposts. For improving revenue collection of sales tax or VAT, excise \nduty, motor vehicle tax, and levies on forest produce, subprogram I envisaged (i) strengthening \nof composite checkposts at three main entry and exit points (such as Boxirhat, Digarkhal, and \nSrirampur) on the trading routes between Assam and other states in the northeastern region, \nand (ii) building up a composite computerized database (covering major own-tax sources) at \nthese checkposts. This was based on the assumption that revenue losses were mostly due to \nthe other states in the region being \u201ctax havens\u201d. The above-mentioned checkposts have been \nnotified  during  FY2006.  The  checkposts  will  achieve  their  goals  upon  setting  up  of  the \ncomputerized  system  and  necessary  equipment  to  allow  for  building  up  of  the  database, \nfacilitating one-stop data capture for VAT, excise, motor vehicle tax, and forest produce levies \ninstead of the current four stops each truck has to undertake for each data capture. This is \nexpected to lead to cross-verification of information as well as reduced stoppage time for the \ntrucks at the checkposts.  \n \n62.  Subprogram II thus focuses on supporting the procurement, installation, and use of \nnecessary  facilities  and  equipment  for  the  composite  checkposts.  All  the  procurement  of \nfacilities and equipment in three checkposts will be completed and at least one checkpost will be \nmade comprehensively operational under subprogram II.   \n \n2.  Component 2: Prioritized Expenditure Management \n \n63.  Following the enactment of the FRBM Act, the government of Assam has been able to \ncontrol its deficits and is on course to meet the targets set in the FRBM Act for revenue and \nfiscal  deficits\u2014revenue  deficit  of  0%  to  GSDP  and  fiscal  deficit  of  3%  of  GSDP.  Under \nsubprogram I, the key objectives in the area of expenditure management were (i) limiting the \ngrowth rate of expenditure by limiting the committed expenditure on pensions and salaries, \n(ii) improving the budget preparation and monitoring mechanisms, and (iii) increasing allocation \n                                                 \n30 For this purpose, the government of Assam has notified the policy on OVM and ordered constitution of district \ncommittees chaired by the deputy commissioners of the districts. The committees have started functioning in \nseveral districts and have compiled basic data. \n ", "  17\nfor O&M expenditure as per the stipulations under the MTFP. Under subprogram II, the focus \nwill be on taking these reforms further by putting in place systems and procedures for the policy \nmeasures adopted under subprogram I relating to expenditure management. The key outputs \nbeing targeted under the expenditure management outcome area are given in the following \nparagraphs. \n \n64.  Outcome-Based  Budgeting.  Budgeting  in  state  governments  has  historically  been \nmore expenditure oriented than results oriented. Subprogram I thus focused on instituting better \nbudget reporting and transparency through presentation of achievement of FRBM targets, or \nremedial action on key fiscal information, including contingent liabilities, off-budget borrowings, \narrears, PSE losses, and subsidy payments. The government of Assam has enacted the FRBM \nAct and has been presenting this information as part of FRBM compliance reports submitted in \nthe legislature. Subprogram II will focus on furthering the reforms in budgeting by supporting the \ninitiation of OBB, and, in doing so, will take into account the experiences of implementation over \nthe program period. Presently, the budget cycle is not linked to the achievement of the specified \noutcomes, but rather is driven by input-based line item budgeting.  \n \n65.  Recognizing the drawbacks of this approach, the government of Assam\u2019s medium-term \nobjective is to move towards OBB, including full alignment (ex-ante and ex-post) with the budget \nnomenclature  (administrative,  economic,  and  functional  classification  and  corresponding \ncodification).31 As a first step in this reform process for FY2009, 10 administrative departments \nhave been directed to justify budget inputs against measurable outputs. Building on this, the \ngovernment of Assam will subsequently develop and issue comprehensive OBB guidelines. \nFinally, and prior to implementation throughout Assam, the government of Assam will undertake \na  pilot  for  OBB  in  a  departmental  scheme.  Under  the  reform  initiative,  OBB  will  lead  to \nformulating  program  budgets  that  are  driven  by  a  number  of  desired  results  which  are  \narticulated at the outset of the budgetary process, and against which actual performance is \nmeasured.32 Subprogram II will support the government of Assam in this process.  \n \n66.  Greater Allocation for Operation and Maintenance Expenditure. The assets of the \ngovernment of Assam have deteriorated due to inadequate budget allocation for maintenance in \na  scenario  where  the  government  faced  financial  crisis  and  where  committed  expenditure \nconsumed  the  bulk  of  the  revenue.  The  focus  of  subprogram  I  was  the  prioritization  of \nexpenditure through detailed breakdown of expenditure in terms of revenue and capital heads, \nand the requirements of greater budget allocations for maintenance in accordance with the \nMTFP. Subprogram II aims at putting in place a strategy\u2014through a strategy document and \nbudget guidelines\u2014to ensure sustainable allocation of O&M expenditure in all departments that \nundertake capital works. Subprogram II will also support actual budget allocation for O&M as \nper the strategy in the Department of Public Works (roads and buildings). A developed state \nsuch as Gujarat spent 3.1% of the GSDP33 on capital outlay in FY2006, while Assam spent \n2.23% in FY2006. There have been many reform initiatives undertaken by other states in this \nsector. For example, the government of Karnataka has introduced a mechanism through which \n                                                 \n31 Currently, alignment with budget nomenclature is done merely as an ex-post exercise by the State Directorate of \nEconomics and Statistics. In the government of Assam\u2019s nomenclature, the functional classification is referred to as \n\u201cpurpose classification\u201d. \n32 The OBB framework will involve the creation of a logical framework made up of six components: (i) objectives, \n(ii) inputs, (iii) expected results, (iv) outputs, (v) performance indicators, and (vi) performance measurement. The \ndistinguishing feature of OBB is expected to be its primary focus on expected results and the use of performance \nindicators to measure the degree of achievement of the expected results. \n33 Source: Reserve Bank of India. \n ", "18  \n15% of the planned budget can be utilized for repair and maintenance activities in selected \nsocial and infrastructure sectors.34 \n \n67.  Creation of Fixed Asset Registers. There are inadequate accountability mechanisms \nin place in the asset-creating departments of state governments due to a lack of information on \nthe assets created by the departments. There has been an announcement of the intent of the \nGovernment to move to accrual-based accounting from cash-based accounting. Subprogram I \nenvisaged movement towards departmental budget performance orientation. Based on these \ndevelopments, subprogram II envisages supporting the creation of fixed asset registers in the \ndepartments  to  better  estimate  the  maintenance  expenditure  requirements  as  well  as  to \nfacilitate an eventual movement to accrual-based accounting. \n \n68.  Pensions Liability Management. Pension liabilities of the government of Assam have \nbeen increasing over the years with an aging employee population. The seriousness of the \nissue was compounded by the fact that the liability was unknown and unfunded. Subprogram I \nsupported a two-pronged approach to address the issue of mounting pension liabilities. First, \nthe government of Assam was to mitigate the liabilities through movement from the current \ndefined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pension scheme for employees joining \nthe government after 1 February 2005. Second, the government was to create an employee \ndatabase and pensioners\u2019 database to enable an actuarial valuation of pension liabilities of \nemployees who joined the government of Assam prior to 1 February 2005 and pensioners. This \nwas to enable the government to formulate its revenue and expenditure policies accordingly. \nThe government of Assam has since adopted the defined contribution pension scheme. The \ngovernment  has  also  included  in  the  budget  for  FY2008  its  contribution  to  the  defined \ncontribution  pension  scheme.  The  employees\u2019  database,  pensioners\u2019  database,  and  the \nvaluation of pension liabilities have been finalized and will form the basis for future reform \nactions.      \n \n69.  While the defined contribution pension scheme is currently in place, the government of \nAssam  has  neither  made  contributions  to  the  scheme  for  the  employees  who  joined  the \ngovernment  after  1  February  2005  nor  deducted  contributions  from  the  salary  of  those \nemployees. For the defined contribution pension scheme to function effectively, which includes \nmaking use of the fund managers identified under the Government of India pension scheme, \nthere should be an agreement between the government of Assam and those fund managers. \nSubprogram II supports the government of Assam\u2019s implementation of the defined contribution \npension scheme. The agreement is for the use of these fund managers for managing the funds \ncontributed by the government of Assam and its employees under the scheme. Second, the \ngovernment of Assam should have an arrangement with the employees with respect to the \nexisting arrears of the employees\u2019 contribution to the scheme. Counterpart funds generated \nfrom the loan will provide support to the government of Assam in meeting the arrears in its \ncontributions  under  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme  for  employees  joining  the \ngovernment after 1 February 2005.   \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthened Debt Management \n \n70.  Under  subprogram  I,  the  government  of  Assam  has  significantly  reduced  its  debt \nservicing costs through one-time settlements of outstanding loan repayments and interest dues \nwith its lenders. It has also undertaken debt swaps of high-cost loans from the Government. The \n                                                 \n34 Ram, N. Gokul. Bangalore: Karnataka Government Secretariat (21 November 2006). Guidelines for Classification \nof Expenditure for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan 2007\u20132012. http://www.kar.nic.in/finance/fd21bpe2006.pdf \n ", "  19\ngovernment of Assam also benefited from the consolidation of central government loans with \nthe revised interest rate of 7% per annum as a result of its enacting the FRBM Act following the \nrecommendations of the TFC. Another significant achievement is the establishment of the debt \nmanagement cell and the installation of the debt recording and management system that has \ncaptured all the direct liability of the government of Assam in the system. The government has \nalso limited the volume of guarantees it can provide for borrowings by its agencies under the \nFRBM Act.  \n \n71.  Debt Management. However, the function of debt management is fragmented across \nvarious departments and agencies with no central consolidation of data on outstanding loans \nand debt servicing obligation projections. Another aspect that is weak in the government of \nAssam is the process of issuance of guarantees and the lack of centralized information on the \noutstanding guarantees.  \n \n72.  Under  subprogram  II,  the  government  of  Assam  will  focus  on  consolidating  these \ndevelopments with strengthening the debt management unit with full-time staff, and building the \ncapacity of that staff. It will also support the standardization of processes and procedures by \npreparing a debt management policy and procedural manual. The debt reconciliation work will \nbe  advanced  through  reconciliation  of  outstanding  government  of  Assam  loans  from  the \nadministrative ministries of the central government.35  \n \n73.  Management of Guarantees. Subprogram I focused on consolidating the information \non  all  guarantees  issued  by  the  government  of  Assam  against  the  borrowings  by  PSEs. \nSubprogram II will focus on ensuring that suitable guidelines are adopted with respect to the \nissuance of guarantees in order to control spiraling guarantees. It will also support the setting up \nof the Guarantee Redemption Fund as a mechanism for addressing liabilities arising from \nenforcement of guarantees against the government of Assam.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Closure of Public Sector Enterprises  \n \n74.  The state\u2019s PSEs have historically been a fiscal drag on its finances. There are 48 PSEs \nin Assam, of which 33 are companies, 8 are cooperatives, and 7 are statutory bodies. The PSEs \nhave  historically  been  known  for  not  keeping  up-to-date  audited  accounts.  At  the  time  of \ninitiation of the AGPRM, there was no information available for 15 PSEs, and there was some \ninformation but no accounts for 14 PSEs. Thus, for 60% of the PSEs, the reliance on available \nfinancial information was limited. Of the remaining 19 PSEs, 15 had provisional accounts and \nthere were only four PSEs where audited accounts were available. The salary dues of the \nemployees  of  the  inoperative  PSEs  continued  to  grow  as  a  contingent  liability  for  the \ngovernment of Assam. The PSEs regularly defaulted on the loans taken by them and that also \nled to the build-up of the contingent liability on the government of Assam.36  \n \n                                                 \n35  Some outstanding loans of the government of Assam from the Government of India remain to be reconciled with \nthe relevant government ministries.  \n36 The government of Assam\u2019s total contingent liability is around Rs8 billion. Moreover, the government of Assam has \nenacted clear guidelines for issuing guarantees in the FRBM Act. There are two such provisions such as (i) restrict \nthe total debt stock of the government of Assam including the government guarantee to 45% of GSDP of the \nprevious year at current prices within a period of 5 years beginning on the 1 April 2005; and (ii) the government of \nAssam guarantee for the loan contracted by PSEs, boards, companies, corporations, cooperative societies or \nautonomous organizations under the government of Assam, shall be restricted at any point of time to 50% of \nstate\u2019s own tax and nontax revenue of the previous year or 5% of the GSDP of previous year at current prices, \nwhichever is lower. \n ", "20  \n75.  Against this backdrop, under subprogram I the government of Assam notified the closure \nof eight loss-making PSEs and provided some compensation to the employees of the PSEs \nnotified for closure. It also announced a one-time settlement of outstanding debt repayments of \nthese PSEs to stop the growth of salary dues. Moreover, subprogram I instituted a social safety \nnetwork for the employees of those PSEs that were notified for closure.  \n \n76.  Subprogram II focuses on advancing the PSE closure process through notification of \nmore inoperative PSEs for closure and the government of Assam has notified three more PSEs \nfor closure. In this respect, the government of Assam will set up a taskforce to (i) implement \nPSE  closure;  (ii)  implement  and  monitor  labor  rehabilitation  plans  for  employees  of  PSEs \nnotified  for  closure,  including  implementation  of  the  social  safety  net;  (iii)  complete  VRS \ncompensation  disbursement  for  employees  of  PSEs  notified  for  closure;  and  (iv)  retrain \nemployees of PSEs notified for closure (including public dissemination of training opportunities). \nSubprogram II will support the completion of compensation for employees of the 12 PSEs \nnotified for closure, which includes salary dues and VRS compensation as well as statutory \ndues of the PSEs notified for closure.37 The assets of those PSEs are required to be liquidated \nas part of the process of achieving legal closure. Subprogram II will support the initiation of the \nlegal closure process of the PSEs through setting up of an asset management cell (AMC) to \nundertake the valuation and subsequent liquidation of assets of the PSEs notified for closure. \nSubprogram II will support achievement of legal closure of the PSEs through (i) getting the \naccounts of the PSEs updated, (ii) completing statutory audits for the PSEs notified for closure, \nand (iii) liquidating assets of the closed PSEs through institution of the AMC. \n \n77.  The institutional arrangements for implementing further reform actions related to the \nPSEs notified for closure include a high-level taskforce for the implementation of accepted \ndecisions taken on PSE reform proposals in a systematic manner. It is proposed that the \ntaskforce  would  have  three  permanent  members,  such  as  the  principal  secretaries  of  the \nDepartment of Public Enterprise, the Finance Department, and the Revenue Department. A \nfourth member will be co-opted in the form of principal secretary of the relevant administrative \ndepartment  for  the  PSE  concerned.  The  principal  secretary  of  the  Department  of  Public \nEnterprise will be the chairperson of the taskforce and the secretarial work will be done by the \nDepartment of Public Enterprise. Another institutional arrangement is that an AMC will be \nformed. It will hire specialists with the aim of managing custody and security of assets of closed \nPSEs until their disposal, and also assist the taskforce in undertaking other related tasks. The \ncomposition of the AMC will be decided by the taskforce based on the emerging requirements \non a case-by-case basis for liquidation of PSE assets. The AMC will be physically established in \nthe  Assam  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (AIDC) 38  and  will  utilize  the  available \ninfrastructure of the AIDC to efficiently discharge its functions. However, the AMC will report to \nthe taskforce and will not be under the administrative control of the AIDC.  \n \nC.  Important Features of Subprogram II \n \n78.  One of the important features of subprogram II is that consideration has been given to \nreform  phasing  and  sequencing in  order  to enhance  the  links  between  subprogram  I  and \nsubprogram II. First, this is evident in areas such as the legislative and regulatory reforms \ncombined with enhanced institutional and human resource capacities, which now move to actual \n                                                 \n37 The statutory dues include statutory audit fees, taxes, duties, and other outstanding levies. \n38 The  Assam  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (AIDC)  is  a  public  sector  enterprise  which  reports  to  the \nDepartment of Industries and Commerce and targets at improving the industrial activities and environment of \nAssam. The facilities of the AIDC will be used by the AMC to implement its mandate and tasks. \n ", "  21\nimplementation of these reform initiatives in various fields, including composite checkposts, \ndistricts, and sub-registrars' offices. Second, subprogram II targets upgrading the MIS and \nenhancing the interface between the tax MIS and treasury MIS, including pilot operation of \nreform initiatives such as on land records, property registration, and e-filing. All these measures \nwill lead to increased efficiency and transparency, thus contributing to good governance. Third, \nsubprogram II also addresses institutional capacity limitations within the government of Assam \nby sequencing institutional and human resource capacity building prior to pilot operation of \nreform initiatives in various areas.   \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n79.  Program  Loan  Amount,  Terms,  and  Conditions. The government of Assam has \nrequested a loan of $100 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance subprogram II. The loan will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. The Government of India will relend the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the loan to the government of Assam. The relending will be in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to the government of Assam, and \nit will be treated as additional to the central government transfers allocated annually to the state \nof Assam.39 The Government of India will bear the foreign exchange risk. Subprogram II loan \nproceeds are expected to be utilized over 3 years from the date of loan effectiveness. The \nGovernment of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n80.  Program  Cost.  Subprogram  II  will  contribute  to  overall  adjustment  costs  for  the \ngovernment of Assam, and among the reform initiatives of the government of Assam, the \nestimates for the four main components are (i) payments relating to closure of 12 PSEs with \naround 4,950 employees for the VRS and related compensation, liquidation of liabilities, and \nstatutory dues of these PSEs ($120 million); (ii) the government's contribution to the defined \ncontribution pensions scheme for employees joining the government after 1 February 2005 ($22 \nmillion); (iii) the guarantee redemption fund ($12 million); and (iv) O&M for a public works \ndepartment ($17 million). A summary of the government of Assam overall cost adjustment is set \nout in Appendix 7.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n81.  The  government  of  Assam  will  be  responsible  for  the  effective  administration  and \nutilization of subprogram II loan proceeds and the counterpart funds. The program reforms will \nbe  implemented  with  the  support  of  a  program  steering  committee.  The  program  steering \ncommittee will be responsible for overall coordination, implementation, monitoring, and policy \napprovals. The committee will be chaired by a senior official not below the rank of the principal \nsecretary  of  the  government  of  Assam,  and  will  include  all  secretaries  of  participating \n                                                 \n39 The Government of India explicitly recognized Assam\u2019s unique geographic, natural, and exogenous constraints on \nits capacity to develop by granting special category state status and extending assistance to government of Assam. \n ", "22  \ndepartments.  The  Finance  Department  will  continue  to  work  as  the  Executing  Agency  for \nsubprogram II. \n \n82.  The  fiscal  management  unit  (FMU),  established  in  the  Finance  Department  under \nsubprogram I, will continue to coordinate the fiscal management reforms envisaged under \nsubprogram II, and will be responsible for daily implementation of subprogram II under the \nguidance of the program steering committee. The FMU will coordinate with ADB and various \nstakeholders towards achievement of the actions envisaged under subprogram II. The debt \nmanagement  unit,  established  in  the  Finance  Department  under  subprogram  I,  will  be \nreorganized with dedicated full-time staff and one external advisor.40 An AMC will be established \nin the AIDC to estimate and manage the assets of the selected PSEs notified for closure, and to \nliquidate assets of selected PSEs. The program implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n2.  Program Period and Tranching \n \n83.  The reforms supported under subprogram II are expected to be completed in 3 years, \nfrom October 2008 to September 2011. Subprogram II will be meaningful through application of \nOBB, implementation of various reforms on a pilot basis initiated under subprogram I, such as \n(i) O&M expenditures and budget allocation and completion of fixed asset registers in selected \ndepartments, (ii) operation of the computerized OVM in selected sub-registrar\u2019s offices, and (iii) \nmaking the large taxpayer unit and e-filing operational. It is expected that the operation of these \nvarious policy reforms will be replicated easily in other departments and other districts in order \nto secure ongoing reform initiatives after the completion of subprogram II.   \n \n84.  The loan will be released in three tranches: (i) $40 million for the first tranche, (ii) $40 \nmillion for the second tranche, and (iii) $20 million for the third tranche.41 The first tranche will be \nreleased  upon  satisfaction  of  all  agreed  conditions  for  the  first  tranche  and  following \neffectiveness of the loan. The second tranche will be released upon satisfaction of all agreed \nconditions for the second tranche, estimated to be within 12 months of the first tranche release. \nThe third tranche will be released upon satisfaction of all agreed conditions for the third tranche, \nestimated to be within 18 months of the second tranche release.   \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n85.  The proceeds of the subprogram loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items listed in Appendix 9 and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources.  \n \n86.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998),42 the proceeds of the subprogram loan \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required but loan \nproceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification provided by the Borrower for a period of \n                                                 \n40  To be recruited for 12 months under the AGPRM program loan in subprogram II.  \n41  Prior to the release of the third tranche, the government of Assam is required to apply $72 million from the first and \nsecond tranches for VRS and related compensation, and $8 million from the second tranche for the government of \nAssam\u2019s contribution to the defined contribution pension scheme. This is to ensure support for the two components \nof the government of Assam\u2019s reform initiatives that require substantial financial allocation from the government of \nAssam and support from subprogram II.  \n42 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila \n(R50-98, approved in 23 March). \n ", "  23\n12 months for eligible expenditures. For each tranche, when subprogram loan proceeds are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development \nassistance, will be equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during such \nyear.  \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n \n87.  The local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan will be used to finance \nadjustment costs under subprogram II, including compensation for employees of the 12 PSEs \nnotified for closure (which includes salary dues and VRS compensation), the government of \nAssam\u2019s arrears in contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme, the guarantee \nredemption fund, and O&M budget allocation for a public works department on a pilot basis.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n88.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Second Governance \nand Anticorruption Action Plan43 was explained to, and discussed with, the government of \nAssam and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, implementation of subprogram II shall adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. \nADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to subprogram II. In this regard, \ninvestigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken by the \nGovernment. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with subprogram II shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to subprogram II. \n \n89.  ADB affirms that corrupt behavior is a serious hindrance to the development process. It \nrejects the argument that corruption\u2019s beneficial effects outweigh its negative consequences, or \nthat it is inappropriate for international financial institutions to address such issues. ADB notes \nthat  experience  drawn from  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  and  elsewhere  demonstrates  that \nsignificant progress can be made against corruption if the proper legal, institutional, and policy \nreforms are in place. ADB welcomes the growing focus upon anticorruption issues as part of its \nbroader  effort  to  advance  the  principles  of  transparency,  predictability,  accountability,  and \nparticipation under its governance policy. At the broadest level, ADB\u2019s stance on anticorruption \nissues is intended to reduce the burden that widespread, systemic corruption exacts upon the \neconomies  of  the  region  and  the  development  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  In \nkeeping with Article 36(2) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank,44 ADB \ninitiatives  regarding  corruption  will  be  grounded  solely  upon  economic  considerations  and \nconcerns of sound development management. They will not involve interference in the political \naffairs of a developing member country or be influenced by its political character. \n \n90.  As part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines prescribed by the implementation of the second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan. The risk assessment identified a number of governance and corruption risks that could \nimpact on subprogram II. The identified risks can be categorized as those that are (i) exogenous \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n44  ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n ", "24  \nto the state (such as central policy changes, delays in specific initiatives, and exposure to \ninternational  market  risks),  (ii)  within  the  state  machinery  (such  as  low  capacity  within \ngovernment agencies, weak internal accountability mechanisms, and risk of policy reversal), or \n(iii)  specifically  program-related  (such  as  the  risk  of  dispersion  of  state  functions  in  fiscal \nmanagement, potential proliferation of adjustment costs of PSE closures, and gaps in relevant \nrules and regulations). The identified risks vary, but the one type I risk (one that requires urgent \nattention and needs to be addressed prior to providing any support) is currently managed in \nselected departments through the technical assistance and capacity-building support provided \nunder subprogram I. Government commitment to the program has been publicly reinforced, \nincluding through the budget speech, and is not seen as a risk. For further risk analysis, see \nAppendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n91.  The central and state governments will maintain records of accounts. To ensure proper \nfund management, ADB retains the right to audit the use of program loan proceeds. The \naccounts will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to \nADB. The FMU in the Finance Department will send quarterly progress reports to ADB on policy \nand  institutional  reforms  implementation.  The  reports  will  describe  progress  made  in \nsubprogram II and any changes to the implementation schedule, and will also identify any \nproblems encountered and remedial actions taken.  \n \n7.  Program Monitoring and Tranching \n \n92.  ADB will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports and will field \nregular missions to (i) confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release; (ii) confirm release \nof adequate funds from the government of Assam for program activities; (iii) monitor continued \napplicability  of  the  assumptions  that  might  impact  program  success,  such  as  on  political \nconditions, as well as on specified risks and their mitigating measures; and (iv) advise on \nactions to maintain effective implementation within the program period. The program loan has \nthree  tranches  which  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  respective  policy \nconditions. \n \n8.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n  \n93.  The FMU will operate a system to monitor and evaluate the performance of subprogram \nII that will use the targets, indicators, assumptions, and risks in the policy matrix and the \nprogram framework. The FMU will submit quarterly reports to the program steering committee, \nand  these  will  also  be  made  available  to  ADB.  Not  later  than  3  months  after  program \ncompletion, the government of Assam will provide ADB with a program report, including an \nassessment of overall program performance. The government of Assam and ADB will carry out \nperiodic reviews of subprogram II based on reports and other documents, and such reviews will \ninclude tracking the fiscal indicators under the MTFP. TA will be provided to the government of \nAssam by ADB, and this will enhance institutional capacity building in order to assist the reform \ninitiatives, including full compliance with tranche-related conditions. \n \n9.  Program Review \n \n94.  The government of Assam and ADB will undertake comprehensive midterm reviews of \nsubprogram II 3 months prior to the scheduled release of the second and third tranche funds. \nThe  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  program  scope,  design,  and  implementation \n ", "  25\narrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program  conditions  and \ncovenants; and (iii) identify problems and constraints. The midterm reviews will be based on the \nassessment report to be prepared by the consultants under the associated TA program. If the \nmidterm  review  determines  that  changes  are  required  in  program  implementation,  the \ngovernment of Assam and ADB will agree on measures, including changes in implementation \narrangements, to ensure that the program obligations are met.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n95.  The primary objective of the TA will be to support the key institutions responsible for \nreform programs across various activities to improve fiscal management performance. The \nsecondary objective of the TA will be to support the government of Assam to comply with all the \npolicy matrix conditions under the program loan. The specific areas to be covered under the \nterms  of  reference  of  the  TA  include  strengthening  capacity  and  professional  skills  at  the \nFinance Department, the Department of Public Enterprises, the Department of Commercial Tax, \nthe AMC, and other government institutions linked to fiscal management reforms.  \n \n96.  The Finance Department will be the EA for the TA. Support will also be provided to \nimplementing agencies to enable them to attain the policy reforms and actions that are specified \nin the policy matrix. In particular, TA support will be provided in the following areas: (i) revenue \nadministration, (ii) debt management and expenditure prioritization; (iii) PSE reforms; and (iv) \ninstitutional and human resource capacity building to develop capacities such as management, \nleadership,  facilitation,  negotiation,  and  conflict  resolution  competencies,  as  well  as  skills \ntraining to implement policy and procedural actions under subprogram II. For efficient training of \nlarger numbers of officials, trained consultants will be recruited in conjunction with local training \ninstitutions.   \n \n97.  TA program will commence within 4 months of the program loan effectiveness. It will be \nimplemented over 2.5 years, and is expected to be completed by June 2011. The consulting \nservices will be delivered intermittently over the TA program implementation period. It will \nrequire a total of 55 person-months of national consulting services, and the national consultants \nwill  be  recruited  using  a  combination  of  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  individual \nselection methods according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB will finalize terms of references and other related issues in consultation \nwith the government of Assam. \n \n98.  The TA is estimated at $750,000, of which \n \n(i)  $600,000 will be a grant from the Japan Special Fund, financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan; and \n(ii)  $150,000 will be contributed by the government of Assam with in-kind support \nsuch  as  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  logistical  support  (government\u2019s \ncontribution). \n \n99.  The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan for the TA program is in Appendix 10 \n(the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  and  other  details  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix E).  \n \n \n \n \n ", "26  \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Benefits \n \n100.  The program loan will help improve revenue administration, and strengthen expenditure \nmanagement and debt management of the government of Assam, thus enabling it to create \ngreater  fiscal  space.  The  benefits  of  subprogram  II  are  expected  to  be  evident  in  (i)  the \navailability of more resources to invest in social and economic infrastructure in the state, which \nshould ultimately assist in enhancing the welfare of the poor in the rural hinterlands; (ii) more \nefficient  allocation  of  budget  resources  based  on  outcomes  sought  rather  than  on  an \nincremental and ad hoc manner; and (iii) the ability of the government of Assam, in the long \nterm, to place its fiscal affairs on a sounder footing that can sustain investments for more rapid \nand inclusive growth.  \n \n101.  The point on inclusive growth is critical to the state if it is to deal effectively with the \nsocial marginalization that exists currently. Specific benefits of subprogram II can be outlined as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  greater consideration of outcomes in resource allocations; \n(ii)  better pension management for the employees of the state government; \n(iii)  simplified administrative and procedural requirements (e.g., filing requirements \nunder the VAT Act);  \n(iv)  more streamlined tax administration and engagement with large taxpayers; \n(v)  greater transparency and increased revenues, as a result of auctions of specific \nlicenses;  \n(vi)  more objective valuation of fixed public assets, and a sustainable system of \nmaintenance of such assets; \n(vii)  more effective use of technology to manage administrative processes (such as \nthrough an upgraded TIMS and computerization of property records); \n(viii)  greater transparency in state affairs, such as on contingent liabilities; and \n(ix)  reduced long-term burden on the government of Assam to support PSEs through \napplication of a VRS and consequent retraining schemes for employees. \n \n102.  As subprogram II seeks to strengthen state fiscal affairs, there should be a direct impact \non the economic growth rate of the state, which currently lags behind the national average. A \nhigher growth rate and greater GSDP level will mean that the entire public will eventually benefit \nfrom subprogram II. The impact of subprogram II will also be felt in the medium term by the poor \nin the rural hinterlands. Subprogram II should create opportunities for the state government to \ninvest in much-needed infrastructure that will allow the broader state economy to be better \nintegrated. To date, and to some extent, the remnants of the insurgency problem in the state \nhave  been  a  function  of  the  inability  of  the  state  to  bring  about  inclusive  and  integrated \ndevelopment. A summary poverty reduction analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n \n103.  Subprogram II\u2019s success depends on the government of Assam\u2019s continuing strong \ncommitment to fiscal reforms and to the broader governance issues of transparency in fiscal \nmatters.  There  are  some  slight  risks  that  current  measures  and  reform  efforts,  including \ninsufficient  capacity  in  specific  implementing  government  agencies,  may  not  be  sustained. \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) continued policy dialogue with the government of Assam and \nother  stakeholders  in  Assam  (such  as  business  associations),  and  (ii)  specific  technical \n ", "  27\nassistance  and  capacity-development  support.  For  its  part,  the  government  of  Assam  has \nexpressed its commitment in the budget speech to pursue the reforms sought by subprogram II, \nand the level of engagement in the program design has been substantive. The economic and \nsocial outcomes of policies adopted and actions taken under subprogram II are unlikely to have \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \n104.  The assumptions inherent in subprogram II are that (i) the government of Assam\u2019s \ncommitments to reforms across the various sectors (including PSEs) will remain high during the \nprogram implementation period, (ii) existing central policies that are favorable to the state will \ncontinue to be in place in the medium to long term, (iii) any political developments that take \nplace in the short-to-medium term do not adversely affect subprogram II in any substantive \nmanner, and (iv) the greater fiscal space will result in the reorientation of expenditure into social \nand economic infrastructure. The three main areas of risks that are likely to arise and impact on \nsubprogram II are (i) weaknesses in the institutional capacity of relevant government agencies, \n(ii) fiduciary risks relating to the use of loan proceeds, and (iii) external risks relating to inflation \nand flooding.    \n \n(i)  Institutional  Capacity.  Implementing  subprogram  II  will  place  additional \ndemands on the institutional capacities of government agencies (in terms of use \nof staff time, for example) that are executing and implementing it. Certain reforms \nunder subprogram II will also require skills and experience that are not currently \navailable in the relevant government agencies. These include (a) implementation \nof OBB, and (b) implementation of VRS compensation to employees of PSEs \nnotified for closure. Close performance monitoring and targeted TA (as specified \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  D)  to  the  relevant  agencies  will  help  mitigate \nimplementation delays due to capacity constraints. \n(ii)  Fiduciary Risks. Fiduciary risks in subprogram II could arise in two possible \nways.  First,  there  is  a  generic  risk  that  funds  might  not  be  applied  for  the \npurposes intended. To first mitigate this risk, assurances have been sought from \nthe government of Assam that counterpart funds will be applied for program \npurposes. This includes requiring the application of counterpart funds to VRS \ncompensation for employees of PSEs notified for closure and to the government \nof Assam\u2019s contribution to the defined contribution pension scheme. Second, the \ngovernment of Assam will be required to provide quarterly progress reports to \nADB. Regular monitoring of this commitment by ADB will be done as part of \nprogram implementation.  \n(iii)  External Risks. (a) The all-India consumer price index increased from 3.0% in \nFY2005 to 5.1% in FY2006. At the end of March 2008, the year-on-year inflation \nwas 7.4%.45 However, there seems to be upward pressure on the global prices of \nwheat (which increased by 88% between April 2000 and January 2008) and rice \n(which  increased  by  15%  in  the  same  period).  These  trends  are  no  doubt \ninflationary and there is resultant pressure on the domestic prices of these food \narticles. Since the major expenditure of the poor is on food, the income surplus of \nthe poor and the net of food consumption are most probably reduced, thus \nimpacting the consumption of nonfood items. The inflation rate in India in mid-\n2008 crossed to 11%, and the Indian economy is showing signs of slowing. This \nmay  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  collection  of  revenue  at  the  central \ngovernment  level  and  consequently  on  the  central  transfers  to  Assam  that \n                                                 \n45 As for Assam, the consumer price index for the working class population (1982 = 100) shows a rise of 6.06% in \n2007 over 2006. \n ", "28  \nconstitute a major source of revenue for the government of Assam. (b) Flooding \nis also a major concern for Assam. Floods occur on a regular basis, with the last \nmajor flood occurring in 2004.46 Apart from short-term health and hygiene issues, \nfloods also cause long-term food scarcity since no land is suitable for cultivation \nin the post-monsoon season. Extra resources and planning will be needed from \nthe government of Assam to relieve this perennial problem. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n105.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the government of Assam \nhas given the following specific assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The Government and the government of Assam will ensure that policies adopted \nand actions taken under subprogram II, as set forth in the development policy \nletter and the policy matrix, will be in full force and effect for and beyond the \nduration of subprogram II. \n(ii)  The Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated from the loan \nunder  the  normal  arrangements  for  transferring  external  assistance  to  the \ngovernment of Assam, and will treat such counterpart funds as additional to its \ntransfers allocated annually to the government of Assam. The government of \nAssam will use these counterpart funds to support the adjustment costs for the \npolicies adopted and actions taken for program implementation, and ensure that \nsufficient budgetary allocations are made in a timely manner for the efficient and \ntimely implementation of subprogram II. Prior to the release of the third tranche, \nthe government of Assam shall have inter alia (a) applied $72 million equivalent \nin  counterpart  funds  for  the  complete  disbursement  of  VRS  and  related \ncompensation for employees of the 12 PSEs that have been notified for closure \n(of which $40 million equivalent shall be from the first tranche and $32 million \nequivalent shall  be  from  the  second  tranche),  and  (b)  transferred  $8  million \nequivalent in counterpart funds from the second tranche for the contribution of \nthe  government  of  Assam  to  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme.  The \ngovernment of Assam shall apply $12 million equivalent in counterpart funds \nfrom the third tranche for the contribution of the government of Assam to the \ndefined contribution pension scheme. \n(iii)  The Government and the government of Assam will keep ADB informed of policy \ndiscussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have \nimplications for the implementation of subprogram II and will provide ADB with an \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government and \nthe government of Assam will take into account ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n(iv)  The  government  of  Assam  will  endeavor  that  (a)  critical  program  staff  shall \nremain in their position on a full-time basis for a reasonable duration to ensure \ncontinuity  in  the  implementation  of  subprogram  II;  and  (b)  all  implementing \nagencies  are  adequately  staffed  and  provided  with  the  necessary  financial, \ntechnical, and other resources to perform their functions under subprogram II. \n                                                 \n46 According to the National Flood Commission, the area prone to flooding in Assam is around 300,000 hectares. \nAssam thus accounts for around 9% of the total flood-prone area in the country. Deforestation is a major reason for \nthe floods becoming an annual feature. \n ", "  29\n(v)  The government of Assam will ensure that any communication relating to the \nimplementation of VRS compensation and labor rehabilitation for employees of \nPSEs notified for closure is made available through the local media. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n \n106.  The conditions for the first tranche will be carried out to the satisfaction of ADB before \nthe loan becomes effective  \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  India  for  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Assam \nGovernance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \nand Program Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n                  C.

The Economy \n \n1.  Several structural features have historically constrained the economic performance of \nAssam.  Its  problems  have  been  those  of  remoteness,  partially  hilly  terrain,  and  high \ntransportation costs. The low-income plains regions are also constrained by high population \ndensity, a large but slow-growing agriculture sector, and a high incidence of poverty. In the \n1990s insurgency considerably slowed economic activity in Assam. The gross state domestic \nproduct (GSDP) growth at constant prices from FY1993 to FY1999 was below 2% on a trend \nbasis. With the decline in insurgency in recent years, and some strong tax incentives introduced \nby  the  central  government,  the  manufacturing  and  sectors  showed  buoyant  growth  during \nFY1999 to FY2005, with manufacturing growing at 8.6% per annum and services growing at \n8.0%. Led by this growth, the GSDP trend growth rate was 5.4%. The primary sector growth \nrate, although higher than the previous period trend growth rate, was still close to 1%.  \n \n2.  In terms of compositional changes, the relatively low growth rates of agriculture and the \nprimary sector as a whole have led to a fall in its share among whole sectors, whereas the \nshare of the services sector has steadily increased. The share of the primary sector fell from a \nlevel of nearly 47% to 34 %, a fall of 13 percentage points, amounting to nearly one percentage \npoint per year during FY1993 to FY2005. Correspondingly, the share of the tertiary sector has \nincreased from 38.2% to 49.5%. A significant portion of the services sector comprises trade, \nhotels and restaurants, and public administration. The increase in the share of the secondary \nsector has been much less, from 14.9% in FY1993 to 17.4% in FY2005. \n \n2.  Fiscal Performance \n \n3.  Against the background of the poorly performing state economy during the 1990s, the \nfinances of the government of Assam underwent a major crisis in the late 1990s with the \nrevenue deficit and fiscal deficit reaching alarming levels. In FY1999, the revenue deficit relative \nto GSDP rose to 3.4% of GSDP, having been in surplus in the 3 preceding years. State finances \nremained in revenue deficit until FY2004. The fiscal deficit was close to 5% of GSDP in FY2001, \nand it remained high until FY2004. It was due to a substantial increase in fiscal transfers that, in \nFY2005, a revenue surplus and even a small fiscal surplus was recorded. However, in FY2006, \nrevenue deficit was recorded once again.   \n \nFigure A2.1: Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit as % of GSDP\n6\nP 4\nD\nS 2\nG\nof  0\n%  -2 2000\u20132001 2001\u20132002 2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007\n-4\nRevenue deficit Fiscal deficit\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n ", "Appendix 2  39\n4.  Although Assam was recognized as a special category state in the Fourth Five-Year \nPlan, it was given the benefit of 90:10 grant-loan composition of plan assistance, effective from \nApril 1990. It may be noted that the revenue deficit of a special category state is not comparable \nto the general category states because the revenue receipts of the former include 90% of plan \nassistance given as grants, a significant proportion of which is meant for capital expenditure. \nThus, the true picture was far more serious than what was indicated by the budget accounts. \n \n5.  In explaining the development of the fiscal crisis in the late 1990s, it is notable that \nAssam's finances were exposed to at least four external shocks beyond the control of the \ngovernment of Assam. First was the revision of salaries and pensions of central government \nemployees and the subsequent near-convergence of pay scales and other allowances between \nthe center and the states including Assam. Secondly, there was a fall in the central tax-GDP \nratio by nearly two percentage points during the 1990s, leading to a fall in the states\u2019 share of \ncentral taxes. Thirdly, the revenue from forests in Assam, which at one time was a mainstay of \nAssam's nontax resources, deteriorated sharply after the Supreme Court judgment banning \nfelling of trees unless done according to scientific plans. Fourthly, interest rates have risen \nsharply since the mid-1990s, especially on small savings and central loans.  \n \n6.  These external pressures worked in combination with critical internal weaknesses, which \nwere due to (i) a rise in insurgency affecting economic as well as fiscal performance, (ii) slow \nindustrial growth, (iii) the dismal performance of state public sector enterprises (PSEs), and (iv) \na high salary burden linked to excessive employment in government. The basic mismatch in \nAssam's fiscal position was reflected in the ways and means problem.1 In the crisis period, \nAssam topped the list of states for the number of days in a year for which payments were \nsuspended from the treasury. The state had continuing ways and means problems for several \nyears and regularly ran an overdraft with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  \n \n7.  Just as the onset of the fiscal crisis had extraneous causes, part of the explanation for \nthe beginning of recovery was also due to external factors. The reason for the improvement in \nFY2005  was  higher  transfers  following  the  recommendations  of  the  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission (TFC). This was combined with much higher central tax revenue, which helped \nincrease the resource transfer from the center. A revenue surplus was recorded in FY2005 after \na long gap. Among the internal factors, two are critically important: (i) Assam enacted fiscal \nresponsibility legislation, and (ii) it implemented the value-added tax (VAT) regime. \n \n3.  Resource Mobilization \n \n8.  While the profile of fiscal imbalance provides a summary indication of the position of \nstate  finances,  it  is  also  an  indicator  of  revenue  performance  against  expenditure  trends. \nRevenue performance, in turn, is a combination of the state\u2019s collection of own-tax revenues, \nnontax revenues, and transfers from the center. The state\u2019s own revenue, inclusive of both tax \nand nontax revenues, increased at a trend annual growth rate of 14.46% between FY1993 and \nFY2005, which was nearly four percentage points higher than the transfers from the center, the \nhighest growth being in state tax revenues. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  During the crisis period, Assam topped the list of states for the number of days of access to ways and means \nadvance in a year for several years and regularly ran an overdraft with the central bank (the Reserve Bank of \nIndia). ", "40  Appendix 2 \n4.  Own-Tax Revenue \n \n9.  Between FY1993 and FY2005, Assam's own-tax revenues grew at the trend growth rate \nof 15.26%. The growth in this period, however, was not uniform. Own-tax revenues showed \nstrong increases after FY1998. The state's tax-GSDP ratio continued to improve and reached \n6.2% in FY2004. The tax-GSDP ratio showed a marginal fall compared to the peak reached in \nFY2004, due to the introduction of VAT. It still, however, remained at a level higher than all \nprevious years of the period under review.  \n \n10.  Among the contributors to own-tax revenue, the highest growth was in state excise \nduties, followed by taxes on vehicles, sales tax, other taxes, and stamp duty and registration \nfees. As the share of state excise duties in total taxes was low, its relatively higher growth rate \ncompared to sales tax failed to make any significant impact on aggregate revenue performance.  \n \nFigure A2.2: Own Revenue Receipts as % of GSDP\n6\nP 5\nD\nS 4\nG 3\nof  2\n%  1\n0\n2000\u20132001 2001\u20132002 2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007\nSales tax State excise duties\nTaxes on vehicles Stamp duty & registration fees\nTotal\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n \n \n5.  Nontax Revenue \n \n11.  Nontax revenue relative to GSDP, which was close to 1% until FY1998, also rose \ncontinuously and is estimated to be 2.6% of GSDP in FY2006. The government of Assam's \nnontax revenue arises from its ownership of assets and its role as a provider of services. There \nare  six  main  sources  of  nontax  revenue  in  Assam:  royalty  on  minerals,  interest  receipts, \ndividends, and receipts from general, social, and economic services. In each case, there is a \nrelationship between nontax revenue and a corresponding base, consisting of past investments \nand current expenditure. Thus, interest receipts relate to outstanding loans extended by the \ngovernment, dividends to the outstanding equity investment, and returns from services to past \ninvestments in building assets for providing these services (schools, hospitals, irrigation canals, \ngovernment buildings, etc.) and current expenditure on these services.  \n \n12.  The government of Assam\u2019s nontax revenue accounted for nearly 36% of own revenue \nin FY1993. This contribution steadily declined to 25.5% in FY2001. After this, once again, there \nhas been an improvement in its share relative to GSDP. The improvement after FY2001 has \narisen mainly out of revisions of royalty rates by the central government. Like tax revenue, \nnontax revenue also shows considerable volatility as indicated by the annual growth rates. \nRoyalty on minerals is the major source of nontax revenue for the government of Assam. The \nrelative importance of forestry has receded significantly following the decision of the Supreme \nCourt to ban felling of tress except under suitable scientific plans. It has been highlighted in ", "Appendix 2  41\nseveral studies that cost recoveries in social and economic services have been dismally low. \nThe returns on loans and advances and equity investment have also been extremely low.  \n \n13.  Petroleum royalties have continued to be the largest contributor to nontax revenue from \neconomic services, and the petroleum sector revenue has gradually increased as a proportion \nof nontax revenue. Nontax revenue offers reasonable scope for augmentation, providing a link \nis established between costs and recoveries. Among the social services, medical, public health, \nand family welfare provide the largest share of revenue. Secondary education contributes most \nof the fees collected in education.  \n \n6.  Central Transfers \n \n14.  There are two main components of central transfers: the share in central taxes and in \ncentral grants. In FY1997 these transfers amounted to 13.43% of GSDP, but they had fallen to \n10.84% by FY1999. With the award of the Eleventh Finance Commission, central transfers rose \nto 11.8% in FY2000. In FY2004, these rose further to 14.05% of GSDP based on a rise in plan \ngrants.  In  FY2005,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  Twelfth  Finance  Commission, \ntransfers amounted to 12.8% and are estimated at nearly 17.7% in FY2006, which is due to a \nrise in the share of central taxes and a steep rise in plan grants.  \n \n15.  The  government  of  Assam  finances  are  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  central  tax \nrevenue  because  the  tax  devolution  constitutes  a  significant  share  of  the  state's  total  tax \nrevenue. While the share of central taxes increased from 38.5% in FY1993 to 48% in FY1997, \nthere was subsequently a steady decline. This corresponded to the increasing importance of \nplan grants in total transfers; in FY2006, plan grants were estimated at 56% of total transfers. \nThe share of central transfers in total revenue receipts has fallen from a peak of 72% in FY1996 \nto  nearly  61%  in  FY2005.  Given  that  central  transfers  have  increased  in  this  period,  the \ndecrease in relative proportion does not reflect a fall in central transfers. It reflects the fact that \nAssam\u2019s own revenues have grown even faster. It is a healthy trend that Assam\u2019s own tax \nrevenue, after being lower than its share in central tax revenue, has exceeded central tax \nrevenue in 3 recent years (FY2002, FY2004, and FY2005). This indicates that Assam\u2019s tax \nbuoyancy has improved beyond that of the central tax revenue in recent years.  \n \n16.  Although there has been a decline in the share of central transfers, the dependence of \nAssam on central transfers continues to be high. The recovery in recent years therefore has had \nstrong support due to a rise in both own revenue and central transfers. \n \n7.  Expenditure Management \n \n17.  Total government expenditure relative to GSDP may be considered as an indicator of \nthe size of the government. There was a discernible declining trend in government expenditure \nas a percentage of GSDP in Assam up to FY1998, after which there was an increase in the \nlevel of total expenditure relative to GSDP. Based on sharp increases in plan assistance, two \nrecent years show significant increases.  \n \n18.  Some important features on the expenditure side relate to the rising share of committed \nexpenditure\u2014such as interest payments, pensions, and salaries\u2014and a low share of capital \nexpenditure in total expenditure. Revenue expenditure, after some decline in the mid-1990s, \nstarted rising after FY1996, reaching an unprecedented level of 27% in FY2006. Within the \ncategory  of  revenue  expenditure,  interest  payments  and  pensions  constitute  committed \npayments under general services. Interest payments peaked at 3.6% of GSDP in FY2002, but ", "42  Appendix 2 \nsince then have fallen, based on lower interest rates and relief due to the center\u2019s debt swap \nprogram. Pensions rose steadily up to FY2004, when they accounted for 2.43% of GSDP. The \nother major committed liability comes from salary expenditure, which accounted for nearly 42% \nof revenue expenditure in FY1994. This increased to a peak of 59% in FY2000, reflecting the \nimpact of salary revisions, but it has since fallen. It is reported to have come down to 40% in \nFY2005.   \n \nFigure A2.3: Fiscal Indicators as % of GSDP\n30\nP\nD\nS 20\nG\nof  10\n% \n0\n2000\u20132001 2001\u20132002 2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007\nRevenue expenditure Interest payments Pensions\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n \n19.  It  now  appears  that  revenue  expenditure  is  in  the  process  of  becoming  stabilized. \nSimilarly, capital outlay, which had languished at below 2% of GSDP until FY2003, has since \nshown signs of improvement.  \n \n20.  Among the main categories of revenue expenditure, general services and social services \nare broadly of the same order of importance relative to GSDP, while economic services account \nfor a much lower percentage. Interest payments have accounted for around 2.5%\u20133.6% of \nGSDP; the peak level of 3.6% of GSDP occurred in FY2003. The share of economic services, \nwhich was 4.23% in FY1993, steadily fell in the 1990s and remained below 3% until FY2001. \nSince then it has started rising, reflecting the beneficial impact of recovery in state finances. In \nFY2006, expenditure on economic services is estimated at close to 6% of GSDP, which would \nbe the highest level ever reached. In FY2006, expenditure on social services is estimated at \n10.8% of GSDP. Expenditure on key social services like education and health has been more \nsalary driven. Expenditure on education reached 6.7% of GSDP in FY1999, reflecting the \nimpact of salary revisions in the wake of the Fifth Central Pay Commission. It was after FY2002 \nthat this effect receded, and this expenditure was less than 4.5% in FY2005. \n \n21.  Asset-forming  government  expenditure\u2014capital  outlay  and  net  lending\u2014steadily \ndeclined after the mid-1990s but has shown improvement in the current decade. The share of \ncapital  outlay  and  loans  and  advances  steadily  declined  due  to  a  sharp  increase  in  the \nrepayment obligations of the state. The major factor behind the increase in the repayment \nobligations was the repayment of loans and advances from the central government.  \n \n8.  Debt \n \na.  Direct Debt \n \n22.  A major problem faced by state governments in India has been the sustainability of debt, \nwhich accumulates due to incurring fiscal deficits year after year. The debt-GSDP ratio in \nAssam was nearly 28% in FY1993. It remained roughly at this level until FY1998 and after that ", "Appendix 2  43\nstarted rising as more borrowing was needed to finance the increase in salaries and pensions \nexpenditure. The nominal interest rate also became extremely high in the late 1990s, and this \ncontributed to higher debt servicing costs, putting further pressure on deficits. The debt-GSDP \nratio continued to rise until FY2004, when it peaked at 37.5%. If reserve funds and deposits are \nalso included in debt, the total direct liabilities would, on average, be higher by a margin of \naround three percentage points.  \n \nFigure A2.4: Outstanding Debt as % of GSDP\n40\nP 30\nD\nS\nG 20\nof \n%  10\n0\n2000\u20132001 2001\u20132002 2002\u20132003 2003\u20132004 2004\u20132005 2005\u20132006 2006\u20132007\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n \n23.  With regard to the composition of state debt between FY2000 and FY2005, the share of \nmarket loans in total debt has risen from nearly 23% to 38%, whereas the share of central loans \nhas been falling, from 64% FY1998 to 25.8% in FY2005. With the recommendation of the TFC \nregarding disintermediation of state loans by the central government, the central loans are \nexpected to account for a small share of Assam\u2019s debt, with most of it being consolidated debt \nbased on the TFC\u2019s debt relief recommendations. Thus, in FY2005, the three major sources of \ndebt arranged in order of importance are market loans, National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)-\nbased loans, and the state provident funds.  \n \n24.  Apart from the change in composition of debt, as described above, there has also been \na significant change in the cost of borrowing from alternative sources. While for debt as a whole, \nthe fall in the effective interest rate is quite marked, the fall in the interest rates for market loans \nand institutional loans is by far the greatest. The average interest rate for debt as a whole had \nfallen to about 9.2% by the end of FY2004. With consolidation of central debt at 7.5% under the \nTFC scheme of debt relief and further softening of the interest rate on market loans, the \neffective interest rate has come down even further since then. \n \nb.  Contingent Liabilities \n \n25.  The government of Assam has extended guarantees to loans taken by a number of state \npublic  enterprises  and  cooperative  institutions.  Given  the  financial  performance  of  these \nenterprises, many of these contingent liabilities have the potential of becoming actual budgetary \nliabilities. In many cases, the debt incurred by the organization has not been serviced, so that \noutstanding liabilities have mounted. Against a total guaranteed amount of $400.0 million, loans \namounting to $354.5 million have been taken. Out if these, nearly $294.4 million remain as \noutstanding liabilities in terms of repayments and interest due.  \n \n9.  State Public Sector Enterprises \n \n26.  The state PSEs have historically been a drag on the government of Assam\u2019s finances. \nThere are 48 state PSEs in Assam of which 33 are companies, 8 are cooperatives, and 7 are ", "44  Appendix 2 \nstatutory bodies. The state PSEs have historically been known for not keeping up-to-date \naudited accounts. For example, at the end of March 2004, there was no information available for \n15 state PSEs, and there was some information but no accounts for 14 state PSEs. Thus, for \n60% of the state PSEs, the reliance on available financial information has been limited. Of the \nremaining 19 state PSEs, 15 had provisional accounts and there were only four state PSEs \nwhere audited accounts were available. The government of Assam has a share of more than \n98% in the paid-up capital of state PSEs. In addition, substantial amounts of loans have been \nextended by the government of Assam to these public enterprises. Taking the state\u2019s share of \ndividends and interest payments received on the loans, the return on total investment on the \ngovernment of Assam\u2019s investment is less than 0.5%; in fact, it ranges between 0.25% and \n0.35% on total investment.  \n \n27.  It is notable that out of the 48 state PSEs, four account for nearly 60% of total turnover: \nthe Assam State Electricity Board, the Assam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board, the \nAssam Industrial Development Corporation, and the Assam Tea Corporation.  \n \n10.  Fiscal Management Reform Path \n \n28.  The government of Assam enacted the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management \n(FRBM) Act in May 2005. It was amended in September 2005 and again in August 2007. With \nthese amendments, the FRBM Act has provided for meeting all the conditions for claiming debt \nrelief as provided by the TFC. The following are the main provisions of the FRBM Act: \n \n(i)  Lowering the revenue deficit to zero by FY2008. With the latest amendment, it is \nfurther stipulated that the revenue deficit will be reduced annually at a rate that is \nconsistent with achieving the target of zero revenue deficit by FY2008. \n(ii)  Lowering the fiscal deficit to 3% of GSDP by FY2008. Further, fiscal deficit will be \nreduced annually in a manner consistent with achieving the 3% target of GSDP \nby FY2008. \n(iii)  Restricting the total debt stock, including debt in respect of which the government \nof Assam may have extended guarantees, to 45% of GSDP by FY2009. \n \n29.  In respect of outstanding guarantees for debt raised by various PSEs, cooperatives, and \nautonomous bodies, these will be subject to the limit determined by 50% of the state\u2019s tax and \nnontax  revenue  of  the  second  preceding  year  consistent  with  the  figures  of  the  finance \naccounts. This stipulation, provided for in the latest amendment, changes the original provision \nwhere reference was only to the previous year, and an alternative condition of 5% of GSDP of \nthe previous year was also provided.  \n \n30.  The latest amendment has also provided that in the annual budget, a detailed statement \ngiving the number of employees in government, public sector, and aided institutions, and related \nsalaries, will be provided. \n \n31.  With these provisions, the FRBM Act of the government of Assam now meets all the \nTFC stipulations for getting debt relief subject to actual improvement in reducing revenue deficit. \nIt is understood that the government of Assam\u2019s debt to central government, outstanding as of \n31 March 2004, has already been consolidated and rescheduled for 20 years, as recommended \nby the TFC. The government of Assam now has to ensure that it takes maximum advantage of \nthe write-off provisions linked to any reduction in revenue deficit. \n ", "Appendix 2  45\n32.  As provided for in section 3 of the FRBM Act, the government of Assam presented a \nstatement to the assembly giving details of a 5-year fiscal plan including the relevant indicators. \nThe Five-Year Fiscal Plan contained FY2007 budget estimates and projections from FY2007 to \nFY2011. \n \n33.  The statement presented to the assembly stated that \"the fiscal policy of the state \ngovernment is to make the Annual Plan Outlay free from salary burden and to make more \ninvestment for development activities and accelerate the process of development of the state \neconomy.\" The basic assumptions used for the Five Year Fiscal Plan projections are listed \nbelow: \n \n(i)  Own-tax revenue. Sales tax, state excise duties, stamp duty and registration \nfees, motor vehicle tax, and other taxes are all assumed to grow at 10% per \nannum during the projection period. \n(ii)  Nontax revenue. Assumed to grow at 5% per annum. \n(iii)  Share of central taxes. This is assumed to grow at 5.2% in FY2008 and at 10% \nin the remaining years of the projection period. \n(iv)  Salary and wages. Assumed to grow at 7% per annum throughout the projection \nperiod. \n(v)  Pensions. Assumed to grow at 7% per annum. \n(vi)  Other revenue expenditures. Also assumed to grow at 7% per annum. \n(vii)  Capital outlay. Except for the first year, it is assumed to grow at 10%. \n(viii)  Net lending. Except for the first year, it also grows at 7%. \n(ix)  Recovery of loans and advances. Follows the path of 10% increase in the first \n3 years and 5% in the last year.  \n(x)  GSDP. Shown to increase at 6.5% annum.  \n \n34.  The result of these assumptions is a fiscal profile showing a revenue surplus generated \nthroughout the period from FY2007 budget estimates to FY2011 projections. The fiscal deficit \nrelative to GSDP falls continuously from 3.16% in FY2007 to 2.28% in FY2011. In both cases, \nthe targets stipulated by the TFC are met. The only features of the medium-term fiscal plan that \nmay cause some concern are that capital outlay as a percentage of GSDP falls over time, and \nthe debt-GSDP ratio keeps rising, passing the threshold of 37% of GSDP.  \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \nKEY ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL PLAN \n \nTable A3.1: Medium-Term Fiscal Plan \n(as % of GSDP) \n2007\u2013 2008\u2013 2009\u2013 2010\u2013 2011\u2013 2012\u2013\n2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nFiscal Parameter  RE  Projection  Projection  Projection  Projection  Projection \nA.

For other debt, an interest rate of 9% is applied based \non the progressive reduction of the interest rate. \n(b)  Social services. The expenditure growth rate in education and health is \nset  at  15%  as  compared  to  the  historical  growth  rates  of  10.1%  in \neducation and 7.4% in health. The growth rate in social services as a \nwhole is taken as 10%.  \n(c)  Economic services and other general services. The growth rate for \nother  general  services  (other  than  interest  rate  and  pensions)  and \neconomic services is kept at 10% per annum. \n(iv)  Revenue receipts growth. The growth rate for revenue receipts are detailed in \ntable A3.3.  \n \nTable A3.3: Tax Buoyancies \nTax  Buoyancy  T-values \nOwn Tax  1.399  25.302 \nSales Tax  1.604  17.792 \nState Excise Duty  1.589  6.747 \nStamp Duty and Registration Fee  1.336  30.801 \nMotor Vehicle Tax  1.345  13.391 \nOther Taxes  0.494  4.132 \nSource (basic data): Finance accounts of Assam and budget FY2007. \n \n3.  From the buoyancy coefficients, the growth rate for the respective taxes is derived by \nmultiplying the buoyancy coefficient with the GSDP growth rate. Accordingly, the following \ngrowth rates for different taxes have been used.  \n \n(i)  Sales tax. 11% for the first 2 years and 17.6% for the last 2 years. \n(ii)  State excise duties. 17.5%.  \n(iii)  Stamp duty and registration fees. 14.7%.  \n(iv)  Tax on motor vehicles. 14.8%.  \n(v)  Other taxes. 5.4%  \n(vi)  Nontax revenues. Nontax revenues are allowed to grow at 15% per annum, \ntaking into account the impact of public sector restructuring and increases in user \ncharges as the part of the reform process. \n(vii)  Central transfers. Growth of central tax revenues will continue to be critical for \nAssam because of the relatively large contribution of central transfers in the form \nof tax devolution. The growth in the states\u2019 share of central taxes has been \nassumed to be 18.2% per annum. Assuming that Assam\u2019s share in central taxes \nremains the same during the entire projections period, the same growth rate has \nbeen applied for projecting the state's share in central taxes. \n \n4.  Grants. State plan grants have been assumed to grow at 10% as the historical trend \ngrowth rate is 9.98%. For other components of grants, including Finance Commission grants, \nthe grant profile given in the state\u2019s medium-term fiscal plan has been used, as a large portion \nof these grants has already been determined.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  (GACAP  II)1 of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  specifies  that  program  design  should  incorporate  findings  of \ngovernance,  institutional,  and  corruption  risk  assessments,  and  that  project  documentation \nshould clearly identify risk and risk mitigation measures. Accordingly, this assessment takes a \nrisk-based approach to issues in public resource management in the state of Assam, India.2 \n \nB.  Relevant Governance Issues \n \n1.  Political Economy \n \n2.  The broader political economy of Assam is characterized by, among other things, (i) \nreliance on the capacity of the state and its bureaucratic arrangements to foster development \n(development work in Assam is public expenditure-led and there is now a persistent expenditure \nburden imposed on the state); and (ii) considerable reliance on the central government for \nresources (more than 60% of state revenue receipts). \n \n2.  Public Service and Public Sector Enterprises \n \n3.  The  level  of  government  employment  in  Assam  is  now  considered  to  be  fiscally \nuntenable (almost 50% of revenue expenditure goes to the salary and wages bill). Recent \nremedial measures have included restricting replacement of retiring government employees and \ngrowth  of  salaries,  abolishing  all  posts  which  have  been  vacant  for  more  than  1  year, \nconsideration  of  a  voluntary  retirement  scheme  (VRS)  in  government  agencies,  and \nredeployment of staff. The government of Assam currently has 48 public sector enterprises \n(PSEs), but in 2001 only six PSEs were considered to be performing well, and this dropped to \nfive in 2003 (of these, only two were paying dividends and the other three had no accumulated \nloss). \n \n3.  Public Finance Management \n \n4.  The state\u2019s debt burden was 37.4% to gross state domestic product (GSDP) in FY2005. \nThe government of Assam\u2019s contingent liabilities are also high, as it has given guarantees to \nloans taken by state public enterprises. With regard to revenue, almost two thirds of state \nrevenue  comes  from  central  government  transfers.  Weaknesses  in  revenue  administration \nrange from lack of audit and an operations manual to a weak tax information management \nsystem.  These  not  only  impact  the  effective  collection  of  revenue  but  also  reflect  the \nvulnerability to mismanagement. Finally, there are gaps in expenditure rationalization that are \nreflected in the absence of links between capital and recurrent budgets as well as inadequacies \nin operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure, and weak internal audit function in agencies. \nAlready, the level of expenditure is expected to have reached an unprecedented level of 27% to \nGSDP. \n \n5.  To better understand its public finance management, the government of Assam has \nrecently  enacted  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM)  Act  (latest \namendment  in  August  2007)  which  stipulates  several  fiscal  targets,  but,  more  importantly, \nrequires the government of Assam to show in the annual budget a detailed statement giving the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n2 A detailed risk assessment is shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n ", "78  Appendix 11 \nnumber of employees in government, the public sector, and aided institutions, and the related \nsalary expense.  \n \n4.  Procurement, Corruption, and Transparency \n \n6.  Assam has prepared a public procurement manual which focuses on, inter alia, the \nguiding principles of economy, transparency, accountability, equity, effectiveness, efficiency, \nand  ethical  standards.  Poor  governance,  lack  of  accountability  leading  to  leakage  of \ndevelopment funds, and the problem of corruption in Assam is reportedly substantial. The India \nCorruption Study 2005 ranks Assam the 15th most corrupt state out of the 20 it surveyed in \nIndia.  \n \n7.  The government of Assam now publishes a semi-annual report on achievements of \nfinancial reforms and budget targets. As per the FRBM Act, the Department of Finance should \nalso undertake an annual review of the trends in receipts and expenditure, including the fiscal \nindicator targets for the current year, explaining the reasons for any deviations and related \nremedial measures. \n \nC.  Identification of Risks, Their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  The assessment of risks that this program faces is by nature subjective, hence an \niterative  process  or  peer  review  both  within  the  government  of  Assam  and  at  ADB  is \nrecommended. \n \n1.  Underlying Assumptions \n \n9.  The main underlying assumptions that are made here are that (i) the government of \nAssam will continue with reforms, (ii) effective institution-building processes in key agencies in \npublic finance management will continue, and (iii) the government of Assam shares the view \nthat this assessment presents an accurate and rigorous review of the risks in the sector. \n \n2.  Risk Specification \n \n10.  Some of the risks that could arise, not only in relation to subprogram II but also across \nthe public sector broadly, can be grouped into three broad categories:   \n \n(i)  Exogenous to the state. Includes (a) the insurgency, (b) central policy changes \nor delays in specific initiatives, (c) decline in central transfers, (d) exposure to \ninternational market risks,3 and (e) extraneous events.4 \n(ii)  Within the state machinery. Includes (a) low capacity in institutions, (b) lack of \nproper  management  in  the  public  sector,  (c)  need  to  sustain  internal \naccountability  mechanisms  in  agencies,  (d)  government  commitment  to \ncontinuing with reforms (or even risk of policy reversal), (e) complex bureaucratic \nprocesses  and  outdated  business  processes,  and  (f)  containment  of  the \nexpenditure. \n(iii)  Specific program-related risks. Includes (a) risk of dispersion of government of \nAssam functions in fiscal management; (b) gaps in relevant rules and regulations, \nand (c) PSE-related risks, e.g., potential proliferation in adjustment costs of PSE \nclosures, and costs associated with possible litigation by ex-PSE employees. \n                                                 \n3  For example, the government of Assam is now able to obtain loans directly from multilateral and bilateral sources. \n4  For example, variations in international prices for tea (a key export of the state), that can impart a degree of \nvolatility to the state tax base. \n ", "Appendix 11  79\n3.

Many of the proposed mitigating measures are already included in subprogram II and in \nthe  policy  matrix  inherent  in  it.  The  political  commitment  of  the  government  of  Assam  to \nimplement measures in the policy matrix is an underlying assumption of this risk assessment. \n \nD.  Recommendations \n \n14.  The preceding risk assessment points to several recommendations on ways to not only \naddress the risks but also enhance the design and implementation of the Assam Governance \nand  Public  Resource  Management  Sector  Development  Program.  These  recommendations \ninclude \n \n(i)  provision of technical assistance designed to directly address the type I risk, and \n(ii)  getting stakeholder concurrence on governance and corruption risk strategies. . \n \n ", "Appendix 12  81\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: India/Assam Governance and Public Resource Management Sector Development Program \n(Subprogram II) \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  South Asia Department/ \nProgram loan \nModality:  Division:  Governance, Finance, and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe core focus of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) operational strategy in India is poverty reduction \nthrough infrastructure-led growth. ADB\u2019s current operational strategy for India was laid down in the country \nstrategy and program 2003a\u2014with updates in 2004 and 2005\u2014and the country operations business planb in 2006 \nto reflect the evolving priorities of the Government of India. The three pillars of ADB\u2019s strategy are inclusive and \nbroad-based growth, social development, and good governance. The country strategy and program for India \nmainstreams poverty reduction through growth as the central goal of ADB operations in India.  \n \nIndia\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FY2007\u2013FY2011) envisages a new growth paradigm that will be much more broad-\nbased and inclusive, bringing about a faster reduction in poverty. It focuses on policies and investment plans that \nsupport (i) inclusive growth, with particular emphasis on agriculture and rural development and raising investment \nin infrastructure; (ii) improvement in the quality and delivery of public services; (iii) creation of investment and \nemployment opportunities, especially in rural areas; and (iv) strengthening of infrastructure.  \n \nIn addition to achieving progress in sector areas, the 11th Five Year Plan also aims to foster good governance by \nextending access to essential public services (such as health, education, clean drinking water, and sanitation) to \nthose  who  are  deprived  of  them,  improving  government  capacity,  promoting  local  government,  tackling \ncorruption, enhancing access to justice for the poor, and improving security and public order. This is to be \ncomplemented by fostering partnerships between government, the private sector, and civil society organizations \nin order to improve service delivery.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program aims to assist good governance. It will address key governance issues on a \nsector and thematic basis, and will hence play a key role in supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve \nsector governance and increase sector efficiency (e.g., in energy, transport, education, urban health and urban \nwater  supply,  and  sanitation  sectors).  The  Assam  Governance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector \nDevelopment Program, in turn, aims to address the weaknesses in quality and delivery of services by orienting \nthe government of Assam towards a more results-oriented culture. It also stresses resource allocation both for \ninvestment and for proper maintenance of assets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe link between investment and growth is well established. Given the orientation of the government to make \ngrowth more inclusive, economic growth is likely to have a positive impact on poverty alleviation. There are two \nkey issues implicit in subprogram II: \n \n(i)  How best to maximize revenue so as to enable the state treasury to increase investments in much-\nneeded social and economic infrastructure, particularly in the rural hinterlands where the bulk of the poor \npeople in the state live.  \n(ii)  How best to rationalize public expenditure (including getting a better understanding of the problem of \nincreasing contingent liabilities) so that the government of Assam is not burdened with committed \nexpenditure, as this diminishes the scope for proper investment in social and economic infrastructure \nwhich can directly address poverty. \n \nOther issues include (i) the significance of the operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure on existing assets \n(the quality and efficiency of service output depends directly on the condition of the underlying asset); and (ii) the \n ", "82  Appendix 12 \nneed to ensure that maintenance expenditure does not fall below prescribed norms at the cost of expenditure on \noperations, and while the closure of loss-making public enterprises releases funds for public expenditure, such \nclosure has a social impact with employees losing their source of livelihood. As such, interventions should not \nonly be limited to the voluntary retirement scheme, but the government also needs to be sensitive to the \nrequirement of sustained livelihood for the employees of these enterprises.  \n \n2.  Design Features. \n \nSome important features of subprogram II are as follows. \n \n(i)  For the first time in Assam, an attempt is being made to introduce outcome-based budgeting. This will \nmean that resource allocations are not predominantly process-driven but are instead based on specific \noutcomes sought. \n(ii)  Subprogram II aims to prepare O&M expenditure estimates in selected spending departments and also \nto ensure that budget allocation is in accordance with the estimates. This allows for more judicious asset \nusage. \n(iii)  Subprogram II aims to raise transparency and efficiency in government operations by using information \nand  communication  technology  in  process  improvement  through  upgrading  the  tax  information \nmanagement system and making it fully functional, and by computerizing registration of properties in all \ndistricts except those in the autonomous councils. \n(iv)  Subprogram II takes a holistic view of public sector enterprise restructuring. While an attempt is being \nmade to close loss-making public sector enterprises, issues of management and liquidation of the assets \nof closed enterprises are being planned by setting up an asset management cell. In addition, the social \nimpact of such closures is being mitigated by issuance of guidelines on voluntary retirement scheme \ndisbursement  and  also  for  training  employees  participating  in  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  in \nalternative skills in state industrial training institutes. \n(v)  Finally, subprogram II is wholly aligned with the outcomes and new initiatives of the government of \nAssam, and has its full public backing. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform/s (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the \ncountry and major groups affected: With increased public expenditure on services arising from enhanced \noutreach and cost-effective delivery, demand for labor would increase (direct effect, short term). Wide \ndistribution of spending on services will generate economic linkages that will further increase demand for \nlabor (indirect effect, short term). Vertical and horizontal linkages would generate additional demand for \nlabor (indirect effect, medium term). \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis): Prior information on affordability and accessibility by the poor will be obtained through the ADB-\nsupported project. Communication program to demonstrate a parallel increase in quality of access of \nservices.  \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals: Policy reforms, focusing on (i) substantial increases in own-tax revenue through \noptimal utilization of revenue administration and computerization; (ii) rationalization of expenditure through \noutcome-based budgeting, O&M expenditure estimates, and additional closure of loss-generating PSEs; \nand (iii) enhanced management capacity of debts including contingent liabilities, will allow greater fiscal \nspace, thus enabling the government of Assam to allocate more fiscal resources to much-needed social \nand economic infrastructure. This will, in turn, promote private sector investment, thus leading to income \ngeneration and employment. Moreover, given that youth unemployment has historically been a major \ncontributor to the social unrest in Assam, creating greater fiscal space will have a consequential impact on \nthe resolution of the unrest. \n \n        (Please see Table A12: Poverty Impact Analysis Matrix, and Supplementary Appendix K: Matrix of Poverty \nImpact and Mitigation Assessment.) \n \n ", "Appendix 12  83\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The key socioeconomic issues that are evident in subprogram II deal with the adverse impacts of \nmismanagement of public resources on the economy as a whole and on the lives of the citizens (largely through \npoor service delivery and greater costs of accessing services). Another issue is how the government can \ntranslate greater fiscal space (sought under this program) into greater investments in social and economic \ninfrastructure that will directly address the needs of poor people. Subprogram II attempts to orient the direction of \npublic services towards a results-oriented culture. There are also attempts to simplify provision of services and \nautomate critical operations and make them more efficient. The social impact of critical elements, such as the \nclosure of PSEs, has been adequately considered. Measures such as these will have positive economic as well \nas social effects, including a greater level of public trust in government, and more efficient and effective service \ndelivery.  \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of subprogram II will be not only the citizens who interact with the public sector on a \ndaily basis but also businesses and other stakeholders. All the stakeholders have the same demand that the \npublic sector provides better services more efficiently and effectively (i.e., costs charged do not exceed the true \ncosts of service provision). The state government will also ensure that the taskforce for review of PSEs publishes \na  report  on  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  labor  restructuring,  and  on  the  completion  of  VRS \ncompensation disbursement and retraining of displaced employees of the PSEs that have been notified for \nclosure. \n \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  Social  indicators  have  been  included  in  the  program  framework  to  facilitate \nmonitoring of social development activities or social impacts during program implementation. Regular reviews \nand evaluation in subprogram II are also planned. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation  and  Participation. Stakeholder groups engaged in the program formulation process include \ngovernment agencies (such as the Department of Finance, Department of Public Enterprise, Department of \nRevenue, Department of Pensions, and Chief Minister\u2019s Office), think tanks, and business associations. The \ndecisions made through consultation and participation processes included (i) closure of loss-making PSEs and \nmitigation  of  social  consequences;  (ii)  fiscal  discipline  (adherence  to  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budgetary \nManagement Act targets); (iii) computerization and simplification of processes, including those in value-added \ntax, excise, stamp duty, and land revenue; (iv) requirements related to joining the Government of India pension \nscheme for new employees and making necessary deductions from employees\u2019 salary; and (v) management of \nliabilities, including contingent liabilities, by forming an independent debt management unit. The consultation and \nparticipation processes (prior to program finalization) will involve engaging other stakeholders and getting their \ncommitment to subprogram II. \n \n2.
