The  project  will  help  the  Government  of \nViet  Nam  promote  its  ongoing  reform  initiative  for  upper  secondary  education  (USE)  through \nupgrading  of  teaching  and  learning  to  international  standards,  improving  student  access  and \nretention, and strengthening school management for USE. The project will be national in scope, \nwith investments to improve access targeted to selected disadvantaged provinces. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n \n3. \nCountry  context.  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  high  economic  growth  since  the  mid-1990s \nand according to the World Bank\u201fs World Development Indicators, Viet Nam has been ranked \nas  a  lower-middle-income  country  since  2010.  Gross  domestic  product  per  capita  reached \n$1,224  in  2010,  with  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  6.8%.  To  sustain  growth,  Viet  Nam\u201fs \nindustrial and services sectors will need to undergo substantial reforms to remain competitive; \nthis  will  in  turn  depend  on  a  skilled  workforce.  Improvements  in  access  to  educational \nopportunities at the upper secondary school (USS) level will help boost the quality of the labor \nforce.  Young  workers  (aged  20\u201339  years)  represent  half  (50.5%)  of  the  total  labor  force,  but \nless than 30% of the workforce has completed USE. \n \n4. \nGovernment  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  The \ngovernment\u201fs  socioeconomic development  plan for  2011\u20132015  has  identified the  development \nof  a  high-quality  labor  force  as  one  of  three  key  pillars  for  sustainable  and  equitable \ndevelopment  of  the  country. 3  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u201fs  (ADB)  country  partnership \nstrategy for Viet Nam in 2012\u201320154 has also accorded priority to improving the employability of \nVietnamese  youth.  USE  is  particularly  important  in  terms  of  ensuring  (i)  an  effective  transition \nfrom  basic  to  higher-level  education;  and  (ii)  the  entrance  quality  of  USS  graduates,  of  which \nsome proceed to tertiary education and others enter the labor market. \n \n5. \nAchievements  of  the  first  Upper  Secondary  Education  Development  Project. The \nfirst  project  was  designed  and  approved  in  2002  when  USE  in  Viet  Nam  was  still \nunderdeveloped.  The  national  USE  gross  enrollment  rate (GER)  was  only  15%  in  school  year \n(SY) 2000 and the quality of curriculum and textbooks was poor. The principal objectives of the \nfirst project were (i) to improve access to USE, and (ii) to develop the curriculum and textbooks \nfor  core  subjects.  To  date,  general  USE  coverage  and  the  provision  of  curriculum  and \ninstructional materials have expanded. As of 2011, the USE GER reached 56.3%, while the net \nenrollment  rate  was  50.4%.  Teacher  quality  has  also  improved  through  updated  curricula  and \ntextbooks. \n \n6. \nLessons  from  the  first  project.  Lessons from the first USE project (and other related \nprojects)  have  been  taken  into  consideration  in  the  design  and  implementation  plan  of  this \n\n                                                \n1  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  A  more  detailed  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \n\nProject Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Upper Secondary Education Development Project. Manila (Loan 1979-VIE, approved \non 18 December). \n\n3  Government of Viet Nam. 2011. Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. Ha Noi. \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy, Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nproject.  Previous  projects  targeted  disadvantaged  areas  at  the  provincial  level.  However, \ndistricts show large variations in educational indicators, and the USE project sites for this project \nwill  therefore  be  identified  at  the  district  or  school  level.  Baseline  data  sources  have  been \nabsent. The project will use the results from indicators that can be more easily measured.  \n \nRemaining  and  new  challenges.  The first USE project was successfully implemented \n7. \nand  achieved  its  expected  project  outcome.  However,  several  issues  remain  and  new \nchallenges are emerging that need to be addressed. These include the: (i) overall poor quality of \ninstruction  and  limited  relevance  of  curricula,  (ii)  limited  access  for  disadvantaged  groups  to \nUSS, and (iii) weak planning and management capacity of local authorities for improving USE. \n \n8. \nPerformance and quality. While the USS completion rate is high (92.6% in SY2010), the \naverage  academic  performance  of  USS  students  is  still  low  compared  with  those  in  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations. 5  In  SY2010,  only  10.3%  of  USS  attained  national \nstandards.  Many  USS  graduates  could  not  meet  the  expectations  of  either  industry  or  higher \neducation.  Achieving  significant  improvement  in  the  quality  and  relevance  of  USS  programs  is \ncrucial. To address these concerns, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) is undertaking \nseveral reforms, including improving the quality of teachers and teaching methods, and curriculum \nreform. MOET will adapt the curriculum based on international standards, and in accordance with \nanticipated economic and social needs. \n\n \n9. \nAccess  and  retention.  Having  achieved  impressive  overall  economic  growth  rates, \npoverty  incidence  is  now  concentrated  in  four  vulnerable  groups:  poor  households,  ethnic \nminorities,6 people with special needs, and women and girls. While the national USE GER has \nimproved  dramatically,  the  disadvantaged  target  provinces  have  much  lower  rates.  Poor \nstudents  have  a  completion  rate  of  about  75%,  considerably  below  the  national  average \ncompletion  rate.  The  student  enrollments  of  low-income  households  are  below  those  of  high-\nincome  households  as  a  result  of  the  heavy  burden  of  direct  and  indirect  education  costs. \nPhysically  disabled  persons  have limited  opportunity  to access  USE.  Access to  USE  needs  to \nbe expanded and educational opportunities provided to disadvantaged students. \n  \n10. \nthe \naccountability and effectiveness of USE. While the government has introduced a decentralized \neducation  policy,  capital  expenditure  by  local  authorities  varies,  with  many  not  allocating \nsufficient  funding;7 contributing  factors  are  limited  budgets  and  the  low  importance  placed  on \nUSE.  The  inspection  of  schools  is  limited,  leading  to  significant  differences  in  the  quality  of \nprograms  and  facilities. 8  An  international  study  conducted  by  the  World  Economic  Forum 9 \nindicated that capacity building is needed for school management in Viet Nam. \n\nin  subsector  management  undermine \n\nPlanning  and  management.  Gaps \n\n \nLink  to  ongoing  reform  initiatives.  The  project  will  support  the  ongoing  Secondary \n11. \nEducation Sector Development Program,10 which promotes 10 education reform actions,11  and \n\n                                                \n5  Only 40.1% of USS students received \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d grades in the five-grade evaluation in SY2011 in Viet Nam, \n\nwhich was considerably lower than the similar national monitoring of other Asian countries.  \n\n6  There is a wide gap among ethnic groups, ranging from the 6.6% net enrollment rate among the Hmong to 61.8% \n\n7  Only 58% of capital expenditure is allocated to the local portion (74% of total education expenditures was allocated \n\namong the Kinh in 2009. \n\nto the local portion in 2010). \n\n8  Inspection of USS is conducted once every 5 years.  \n9  Viet  Nam  was  rated  123rd  out  of  142  countries  regarding  school  management  quality  in  the  World  Economic \n\nForum. 2011.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila  (Loans  2582-VIE  and \n2583-VIE, approved on 13 November). \n\n11 The  10  reform  actions  are  (i)  development  of  secondary  education  sector  master  plan;  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nnational accreditation agency for secondary schools; (iii) upgrading of a human resource management strategy; (iv) \nnationwide  teacher  assessment;  (v)  standard  learning  assessment  through  participation  in  the  Organisation  for \n\n\f3 \n \nfinanced the Programme for International Student Assessment 2012 for Viet Nam. The project \nwill  use  the  results  of  the  assessment  in  developing  a  new  secondary  curriculum,  innovative \nteaching methods, textbooks, and information and communication technology applications. \n\n \n12. \nInnovations  of  the  project.  The  project  includes  a  number  of  new  initiatives:  (i)  the \nContinuing  Education  Center  (CEC)  will  be  restructured  from  conventional  informal  education \ncenters into a platform for in-service teacher training (INSETT); (ii) more attention will be paid to \npractical skills of classroom  teaching through the use of teaching simulation rooms for teacher \ntraining  university  (TTU)  students;  (iii)  ethnic  minority  students  will  receive  financial  and \nacademic  support  to  reduce  dropout;  and  (iv)  a  research  study  will  explore  applicable  public\u2013\nprivate partnership models for USE. The project is structured as a follow-on loan to the first USE \nproject rather than a sector loan. The selection criteria for the provinces, schools, and teachers \nand/or students that will benefit from key project activities will be approved by ADB. \n\n \n13. \nDevelopment  coordination.  ADB  is  a  member  of  the  education  sector  group,  which \nserves as a donor coordination framework for the education sector. In Viet Nam, ADB has been \nthe  principal  development  partner  in  the  secondary  education  subsector.  The  governments  of \nAustralia and Belgium have provided grant assistance to secondary education as cofinanciers of \nsome ADB projects. ADB is the only development partner providing USE support. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  employability  of  the  young  labor  force  aged \n18\u201324  in  Viet  Nam.  The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  readiness  of  USS  graduates  for \ntertiary and vocational career development. \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nUpper  Secondary  Education  Quality  Enhanced  to  meet  International \nStandards12 \n\n \n15. \nImprovement  of  teaching  strategies  through  pre-service  teacher  training  and  in-\nservice teacher training. Capacity building of TTU lecturers and curriculum specialists will help \nprepare  a  new  curriculum,  with  supporting  textbooks  and  teacher  training,  in  order  to  improve \nUSE quality from 2015 onwards. The project will provide (i) overseas short-term training courses \non curriculum and textbook drafting skills for approximately 75 core specialists to assist them to \ndevelop  the  new  curriculum  and  textbooks,  and  (ii)  3  in-country  INSETT  training  activities  for \napproximately  18,750  teachers  regarding  piloting  and  implementing  the  new  USE  curriculum \nand textbooks.  \n \n16. \nProvision  of  textbooks  and  development  of  instructional  materials  based  on  the \nnew  upper  secondary  education  curriculum. The new USE curriculum will be developed by \nMOET  using  government  funding,  with  implementation  support  by  the  project  through:              \n(i) textbooks that support the new curriculum for pilot and nationwide use; (ii) teaching materials \n\n                                                \n\nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development\u201fs  Programme  for  International  Student  Assessment  and  national \nachievement monitoring; (vi) periodic curriculum review and upgrading system; (vii) policy on the use of information \nand  communication  technology  in  teaching  and  learning;  (viii)  development  of  a  new  equivalency  program;  (ix) \nintegrated secondary education for children with special needs; and (x) conditional cash transfers. \n\n12 \u201cInternational standards\u201d is defined in government\u201fs various education and training sector plans and strategies as \nthe  quality  standards  in  developed  countries  (e.g.,  member  countries  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development).  \u201cRegional  standards\u201d  refer  to  the  quality  standards  of  member  countries  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nand guidelines to assist in piloting the effective use of textbooks; and (iii) specific and targeted \nteaching support materials/teaching aids for approximately 800 USS in EM regions. \n\n \n17. \nImproving the academic environment for gifted upper secondary school students. \nThe project will support the strengthening of a selected number of schools assigned to nurture \ngifted  students  through  developmentally  appropriate  programs.  The  project  will  provide             \n(i)  laboratory  equipment  and  teaching  aids  in  physics,  chemistry,  and  biology;  (ii)  in-country \ntraining  for  approximately  833  teachers  on  advanced  coursework  from  abroad  in  support  of \ngifted  and  talented  education;  and  (iii)  short-term  overseas  training  for  up  to  15  teachers  and \nvice-principals selected by MOET in consultation with ADB. \n\n \n18. \nSupport  for  a  continuing  education  center  to improve in-service teacher training. \nTo expand the capacity and improve the effectiveness of a provincial CEC to implement the new \nINSETT  for  USS  teachers,  the  project  will  provide  (i)  approximately  63  sets  of  teaching  and \npractical  equipment,  and  textbooks  and  teaching  materials  to  relevant  libraries  to  support \nprograms  conducted  by  the  CEC;  and  (ii)  in-country  training  on  curriculum  reform  for \napproximately 15 teachers from each CEC. \n\n \n19. \nImproving  the  quality  of  foreign  language  training  and  education. The  project  will \nsupport  the  improvement  of  the  oral  communication  skills  of  USS  English  language  teachers \nthrough: (i) the procurement of books for 2,700 schools; (ii) the provision of quality audiovisual \nequipment  to  equip  one  specialist  foreign  language  room  in  each  province;  and  (iii)  in-country \ntraining for core English teachers to focus on enhancing student\u201fs listening and speaking skills. \n\n \n20. \nEstablishment  of  centers  for  pedagogical  excellence.  Teachers  learn  best  by \nfor  pedagogical \nobserving  highly  effective  classroom  practice.  Therefore,  six  centers \nexcellence13 will  be  established  to  enable  TTUs  and  pedagogical  faculties  to  more  effectively \ntrain prospective teachers. These simulation classrooms will showcase highly effective practices, \nincluding  how  to  engage  students  in  their  learning  and  how  to  plan,  manage,  and  assess \nstudent  outcomes.  Specifically,  the  project  will  (i)  establish  6  Centres  for  Pedagogical \nExcellence;  (ii)  provide  simulation teaching  equipment;  (iii)  provide  construction  (or  upgrading) \nof  teaching  simulation  rooms;  (iv)  provide  in-country  training  workshops  for  approximately  20 \nlecturers per center; and (v) provide a two-week overseas training program for 6 TTU lecturers \nand nine specialists from MOET to acquire pedagogical expertise. \n\n \n21. \nImproved teaching of selected subjects. To improve the quality and relevance of USE \nto  national  goals,  five  key  subjects  have  been  identified  for  specific  improvement.14 Effective \napproaches  to  teaching  and  learning  will  be  developed  for  each  subject.  The  project  will            \n(i)  provide  in-country  training  to  improve  the  teaching  practices  of  core  teachers;  (ii)  support \nteachers in recording, publishing, and sharing effective practice; (iii) provide short-term OST for \n15 teachers to acquire updated teaching methodologies; and (iv) conduct an assessment study \non the new teaching methods in mathematics. \n\n \n22. \nSupport for academically disadvantaged groups. To facilitate access to USS, and in \nparticular access by academically disadvantaged students, the project will build the capacity of \nteachers  by  conducting  in-country  INSETT  training  programs.  Teachers  will  be  assisted  to \ndevelop a range of self-study materials and guidelines to ensure that students undertaking study \nvia distance education have access to appropriate materials and support. \n \n                                                \n13 Centers for pedagogical excellence will be established at the following six TTUs: Can Tho, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh \n\nCity, Hue, Tay Nguyen, and Thai Nguyen. \n\n14 The subjects are biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and social sciences. \n\n\f5 \n \nIncreased  Access  and  Retention  of  Disadvantaged  Groups  to  Upper \nSecondary Education15 \n\n2. \n\n \n23. \nNew facility development at existing upper secondary schools in target provinces. \nTo improve access to quality facilities for students in  the disadvantaged target provinces,16 the \nproject will provide 1,050 rooms (and furniture) at existing USS, and specialized equipment for \n152  of  the  newly  constructed  facilities.  These  facilities  will  also  help  improve  the  quality  of \nlearning outcomes by students who attend USS in the disadvantaged target provinces. \n \nSupport  for  ethnic minority  boarding  schools. To encourage increased participation \n24. \nof ethnic minority students, the project will improve the learning environment in selected ethnic \nminority  boarding  USS  through  provision  of  information  technology,  library,  and  related \nequipment. \n \n25. \nPilot  an  inclusive  education  program  for  students  with  special  needs.  To  ensure \nimproved  access  to  USE  by  students  with  special  needs  and  to  develop  an  effective  and \nsustainable  approach  to  disabilities  within  the  USE  subsector,  a  pilot  program  focused  on \ndeveloping appropriate teaching and learning environments for students with special needs will \nbe  conducted.  The  project  will  support  the:  (i)  development  of  sign  language  tools  for  deaf \nstudents, (ii) development and provision of instructional materials on sign language for inclusive \neducation  centers,  and  (iii)  provision  of  in-country  training  in  the  management  of  inclusive \neducation and teaching methodologies for 600 teachers in inclusive education centers. \n\n \n26. \nEducation for sustainable development support for disadvantaged groups. To help \ndisadvantaged  students  continue  with  education  and  training  programs  after  completing  USE, \nthe project will help develop their lifelong skills. The project will provide three in-country teacher \ntraining  programs  for  approximately  1,650  teachers  with  focus  on  (i)  developing  active  and \nengaging approaches to teaching and disciplines that are particularly effective for academically \ndisadvantaged  students,  (ii)  developing  high-quality  life  skills  together  with  an  improved \nunderstanding  of  environment  and  social  issues,  and  (iii)  ensuring  the  cultural  preservation  of \nethnic minorities. \n\n \n27. \nCapacity  development  of  private  sector  schooling.  To  improve  access  to  USE  for \ndisadvantaged groups, new models of finance and management need to be explored that would \nenable private education providers to play an increased role. The project will provide support to \ngovernment  agencies  and  MOET to  undertake  research  and  develop  a  model  on  how  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  can  be  most  effectively  applied  within  USE.  The  project  will  also  pilot  the \nprovision of in-country teacher training to 300 teachers from private USS. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthened Planning and Management of Upper Secondary Education \n\n \n28. \nprovide \n\nCapacity  development  of  upper  secondary  education  managers.  The  project  will \nincluding  planning, \n\nimprove  significant  aspects  of  USE \n\nin-country \n\ntraining \n\nto \n\n                                                \n15  Beneficiaries  of  Output  2  defined  as  \u201edisadvantaged  groups\u201f  will  include:  (i)  ethnic  minorities,  (ii)  physically \ndisadvantaged students, (iii) students from poor household, (iv) students who are academically disadvantaged, and \n(v) students studying in private schools where the average teacher quality is often lower than that in public schools. \nExcept for school construction and provision of equipment, Output 2 activities will be implemented nationwide.  \n16 The  disadvantaged  target  provinces  were  selected  using  the  socioeconomic  and  educational  selection  criteria \nprovided in Selection Criteria and Profile of Beneficiary Provinces and Districts for Civil Works (accessible from the \nlist  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  list  of  33  target  provinces  for  civil  works  is  provided  in  List  of \nBeneficiary Provinces for Civil Works (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Target schools \nwill be finalized based on the site condition at implementation stage. All sub-outputs other than civil works will be \nimplemented  nationwide  (63  provinces).  The  criteria  for  selecting  teachers  and  other  staff  for  in-country  and \noverseas trainings will be developed during implementation and approved by ADB. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmanagement,  and  leadership  for  education  reform.  The  training  programs  will  involve  2,700 \nUSS  principals,  and  600  directors  of  CECs,  and  principals  of  complementary  educational \nschools. Key USE managers participating in an OST program will learn effective approaches to \nquality  management  for  USE  programs.  The  project  will  procure  school  mapping  software  to \nimprove education planning capacity. \n \n29. \nProvision  of  block  grants  to  support  local  government.  The  funding  of  local \ngovernment  departments  and  the  effective and efficient  use  by  each  Department  of  Education \nand  Training  (DOET)  of  their  block  grant  has  been  a  concern  for  some  time.  The  project  will \nsupport  building  the  planning  and  management  capacity  of  DOETs  to  meet  local  needs,  and \ndeveloping  agreed  solutions  to  key  management  issues  for  each  DOET  to  meet  the  reform \nrequirements  associated  with  the  introduction  of  a  revised  curriculum,  new  approaches  to \nteaching and learning, and new textbooks after 2015. Each DOET will receive one  block grant \npackage including a block grants manual, orientation workshops, and monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) training. \n \n30. \nSupport  for  pilot  research  studies  for  upper secondary  education. The project will \nsupport  the  use  of  action\u2013research  approaches  to  help  improve  strategic  planning  capacity  of \neducation  authorities  to  promote  and  implement  the  ongoing  MOET  \u201ceducation  renovation\u201d \ninitiatives. Five action\u2013research packages are anticipated with a focus on (i) developing a model \nof USS autonomy within a framework of social responsibility and accountability, (ii) developing \nmanagement  and  planning  skills  for  TTU  students,  (iii)  managing  curriculum  change  and \ndeveloping instructional materials for complementary USE, (iv) counseling students in USS, and \n(v) organizing USS applied science research. \n\n \nSupport  for  enhancement  of  research  and  training  capacity  for  education \n31. \nmanagement. The project will help strengthen the capacity of training and research centers for \neducation management by providing equipment for a multifunction room at the National Institute \nfor  Educational  Management  (NIEM),  and  in-country  training  to  develop  the  teaching  and \nscientific research capacity of lecturers at NIEM  and the Institute of Educational Managers Ho \nChi Minh City. \n \n\n4. \n\nSupport for Project Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Monitoring \n\n \n32. \nCapacity  development  of  CPMU,  PPMUs,  and  other  Implementing  Agencies.  The \nproject will support the capacity strengthening of the central project management unit (CPMU), \nprovincial project management units (PPMUs), and other implementing agencies responsible for \nproject management and implementation. This output will provide in-country training for project \nmanagement. Consulting services, totaling  471 person-months, will be provided to support the \nCPMU in project implementation. \n \nProvision of equipment and facilities to project implementing agencies. The project \n33. \nwill provide the necessary office equipment, furniture and facilities, and vehicles for the CPMU. \nEquipment will also be provided for PPMUs to ensure timely and quality project implementation. \n\n \nProject  monitoring,  quality  assurance,  and  evaluation.

As  the executing agency,  MOET will  be \nresponsible for project management and provide guidance to the CPMU that oversees the day-\nto-day  implementation  of  the  project.  The  CPMU  will  comprise  a  qualified  full-time  project \nmanager, deputy project manager, and key technical staff acceptable to ADB. ADB approval for \nthe nomination of CPMU staff is a condition for loan effectiveness. All 63 provinces will establish \nPPMUs within each DOET; the DOETs will be the liaison between the CPMU and the PPMUs. \nThe PPMUs will be responsible for implementing activities at the provincial level. Selected TTUs, \nUSS,  and  the  NIEM  will  be  participating  agencies.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the Project Administrative Manual (PAM).19 \n\n                                                \n17 ADB  will  finance  the  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  as  it  (i)  is  within  reasonable  country  thresholds,  (ii)  does  not \nrepresent an excessive share of the project investment, and (iii) is material and relevant to the project\u201fs success. \n18 ADB loan resources will finance the value added tax and corporate income tax charged to the consulting services \n\ncontract for the project implementation contract, which is estimated at 12% of the contract amount. \n\n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAspects \n\nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n\n(iii) Key implementing \nagencies \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\n1 January 2013\u201331 December 2019 \n31 December 2019 \n\nProject  steering  committee:  vice  minister,  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training \n(chair),  representatives  from  the  Department  of  Secondary  Education,  Planning \nand  Finance,  and  Teachers  Department,  National  Institute  of  Educational \nManagement, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance, State Bank \nof Viet Nam, and Office of the Government \nMinistry of Education  and Training \nCentral project management unit (indicatively 1 project director, 1 deputy director, \nseveral  unit  heads,  and  unit  staff)  for  nationwide  activities  and  63  PPMUs  for \nprovincial level activities. \n9 contracts \nICB \n$22.5 million \n16 contracts \nNCB \n$42.9 million \n19 contracts \nShopping \n$1.1 million \n445 person-months (108 international, 337 national) \nQCBS \n$3.0 million \n26 person-months (8 international, 18 national)  \nICS \n$0.2 million \n$1.1 million \n5 contracts \nFBS \n$0.56 million \n7 contracts \nLCS \n$0.05 million \n1 contract \nCQS \n$0.95 million \n21 contracts \nSSS \nRetroactive financing and advance contracting may be applied for up to 5% of the \nADB loan amount with respect to procurement of individual consultants for project \nimplementation support. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed upon between the government and ADB.

The  recurrent  costs,  to  be  borne  by \nthe government  after  the project,  are  estimated at  $660,000  per  year  and include  the  O&M of \nnew  school  facilities  and  equipment.  The  estimated  annual  recurrent  costs  after  project \nimplementation  account  for  0.24%  of  the  USE  operating  cost  during  2020\u20132025.  This  level  of \ncost is sustainable, given the projected size of the education budget. \n \nB. \n \n39. \nThe financial management assessment has confirmed that MOET and key implementing \nagencies  have  sufficient  capacity  for  project  implementation.  The  departments  of  secondary \neducation;  planning  and  finance;  and  education  facilities,  equipment  and  children\u201fs  toys  of \nMOET  are  directly  involved  in this  project.  Having  been  involved  in all  ADB-funded secondary \neducation projects, these departments are experienced with ADB procedures, and past projects \n\nGovernance \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\n9 \n \nwere  successful.20 ADB\u201fs  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOET.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nC. \n \n40. \nPoverty. Indigenous peoples in the northern and central mountain provinces suffer high \nlevels  of  poverty,  and  their  average  years  of  school  attendance  is  lower  than  that  of  Kinh \nstudents, because students leave school early to do agricultural work, or, in the case of girls, to \nget married at a young age. \n \n41. \nGender.  The  project  has  a  gender  equity  theme.  The  project  will  address  the  lack  of \ngender-sensitive  teaching  and  learning  materials,  limited  access  by  female  teachers  and \nmanagement staff to training opportunities, and limited awareness about the value of education \nfor girls. The  project gender  action  plan  ensures  that (i)  all female  management  staff  in  CECs \nparticipate in management training; (ii) strategies promote female access to and completion of \nUSE; (iii) 40% of participants in INSETT, 55% of English teachers, and 60% of teachers trained \non  life  skills  curricula  are  female;  (iv)  new  curriculum  and  materials  are  gender-sensitive;         \n(v)  separate  latrines  are  provided  for  female  and  male  students;  (vi)  20%  of  provincial  block \ngrants are earmarked for addressing gender issues; (vii) gender criteria are included in school \nnetwork mapping; and (viii) all M&E reports include sex- and ethnicity-disaggregated data. \n \nD. \n \nDue diligence has been undertaken on the project design to assess potential impacts on \n42. \nenvironment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized as C \nfor environment and involuntary resettlement, and B for indigenous peoples. \n \nEnvironment and involuntary resettlement. No significant impact on the environment \n43. \nis  anticipated.  The  project  will  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  restrict  access  to  lands,  and  no \nrelocation of people is planned. \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  addresses  access  and  equity  issues  related  to  poor \n44. \nethnic  groups  in  33  disadvantaged  target  provinces  with  large  ethnic  populations.  The  project \nensures ethnic inclusion and equity in all, quality USE teaching and learning including curricula, \ncapacity  development,  and  management  interventions.  Key  features  of  the  ethnic  group  plan \ninclude:  (i) targets for  participation  by  ethnic  teachers  in  various training, (ii)  ethnicity-sensitive \ncurricula and instructional materials, (iii) training materials on life skills include analyses of key \nethnic  minority  social  issues  and  vulnerability,  (iv)  selected  civil  work  sites  located  in  ethnic \nminority areas, and (v) guidelines for block grants to support local needs. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n45. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor  risks  and mitigating measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described in  detail  in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.21 The project is considered to be low risk. \n \n \n \n                                                \n20 ADB.  2008.

As  a \nresult,  project  management  (including  disbursement  and \nprocurement activities) could be delayed. \n\nThe  qualifications  of  candidates  for  proposed  overseas \ntraining may be limited (particularly their language ability). \n\nMitigating Measures \nMOET  and  MOF  will  determine  CPMU  staff's \nremuneration  at  appropriate  and  competitive  level  to \nprevent  turn-over.  Also,  training  opportunities  for  long-\nterm career development will be provided. \nSelection  criteria  for  participants  in  OST  programs  are \nsubject to ADB's prior review and approval to ensure the \ntransparency  of  selection  and  expected  impact  of  the \nOST. Technical qualifications and English proficiency will \nbe taken into consideration. \nDOET and CPMU will carefully examine the allocation of \nteachers for newly constructed facilities beginning at the \nselection stage, to  ensure  the  availability  of  teachers  for \nthese additional classrooms. \n\nfacilities \n\nThe  project  constructs  new  school \nfor \ndisadvantaged  areas  based  on  demand.  However,  the \nHRD plan indicates a decrease in new teacher recruitment \ndue to a decrease in the number of students. As a result, \nthere  may  not  be  enough  teachers  for  newly  constructed \nfacilities in the disadvantaged areas. \nCPMU  =  central project management  unit,  DOET  =  department of  education  and  training,  HRD  =  Human  Resource \nDevelopment,  MOET  =  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  ODA  =  official  development \nassistance, OST = overseas staff training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government and MOET have assured ADB that implementation of the  project shall \n46. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n47. \nThe government and MOET have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement.
