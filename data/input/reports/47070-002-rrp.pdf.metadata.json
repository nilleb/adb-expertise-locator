The  project  will  introduce  an  integrated  approach  to \naddress constraints in lake environmental protection and livelihood development.2  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nOne  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing  water  management  in  the  PRC  relates  to \nfreshwater lakes, as many of them are severely polluted. Since the mid-1990s, the Government \nof  the  PRC  has  made  substantial  efforts  to  address  the  problem,  with  emphasis  on  three \nlakes\u2014Chao,  Dianchi,  and  Tai  lakes\u2014but  the  water  quality  of  these  lakes  has  not  improved \nsignificantly. The government realized the importance of pollution prevention in lakes by drawing \nlessons  from  the  rehabilitation  of  polluted  lakes,  including  the  Chao,  Dianchi,  and  Tai  lakes, \nwhich  were  rehabilitated  at  very  high  cost.  Experience  has  shown  that  it  is  very  difficult  and \nineffective to restore water quality in large lakes once they are polluted. \n\n4. \nLocated  in  south  Hunan  Province,  Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  reservoir  formed  after  the \nconstruction  of  Dongjiang  Dam  in  1986  on  the  Leishui  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Xiang  River. \nDongjiang  Lake  is  a  multipurpose  reservoir  for  hydropower,  flood  control,  water  supply,  and \nirrigation.  It  has  a  surface  area  of  160  square kilometers  (km2)  and  a  total  storage  capacity  of \nabout 8.12 billion cubic meters (m3). The catchment area of the Dongjiang Lake is 4,719 km2. \n\nthe  government\u2019s  eco-compensation  policy \n\nThe  government\u2019s  priority  is  to  protect  the  water  resources  of  Dongjiang  Lake  from \n5. \npollution.  Dongjiang  Lake  has  been  selected  as  one  of  five  river  basins  for  nationwide  pilot \nthe  Asian \ntesting  of \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  continuous  support  since  2009.  Dongjiang  Lake  was \nprioritized  for  support  in  the  National  Plan  for  Relatively  Good-Quality  Lake  Ecological  and \nEnvironmental  Protection,  2013\u20132020,  jointly  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Development and Reform Commission. \n\nframework, \n\nto  which \n\n6. \nDongjiang  Lake  is  a  strategic  water  source  for  supporting  resource-saving  and \nenvironment-friendly social development in Hunan Province. Maintaining healthy environmental \nservices  in  Dongjiang  Lake  is  vital  to  achieving  sustainable  development  of  the  Xiang  River \nbasin, one of the major regions of the government\u2019s Yangtze River Economic Belt Initiative. The \nXiang  River  basin  is  home  to  about  40  million  people  and  accounts  for  over  70%  of  Hunan \nProvince\u2019s  total  gross  domestic  production.  In  addition  to  supplying  water  to  Chenzhou \nMunicipality  and  Zixing  City,  Dongjiang  Lake  serves  as  a  backup  water  source  for  Hunan \nProvince\u2019s  major  cities  of  Changsha,  Xiangtan,  and  Zhuzhou  in  the  Xiang  River  basin  to \nimprove the water security of 13 million people in these cities. The lake\u2019s large storage capacity \ngreatly improves flood and drought management for the downstream cities and navigation of the \ndownstream Xiang River. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Hunan  Dongjiang \n\nLake Environmental Protection and Integrated Utilization Project (TA 8638-PRC). \n\n\fHunan  Provincial  Government \n\nlocal  governments  have  prioritized \n(HPG)  and \n7. \nenvironmental  protection  of  Dongjiang  Lake.  Protection  zones  have  been  established  in  the \nDongjiang Lake basin in accordance with the provincial-approved Dongjiang Lake Basin Water \nEnvironmental  Protection  Regulation  (2002).  The  regulation \nthe \ndevelopment  of  the  basin  and  restricts  various  activities  in  different  protection  zones  that  may \ncause adverse impact on the water environment. Since 2002, HPG and local governments have \ninvested  nearly  CNY1  billion  in  protection  of  the  lake,  including  closure  of  mines,  removal  of \ncage  fishing,  ship  renovation  and  improvement,  and  job  training  for  nonfarming  opportunities. \nContinued  efforts  by  HPG,  local  governments,  and  local  people  help  maintain  the  good  water \nquality of the lake to meet national standards for drinking water sources. \n\nimposes  controls  on \n\n8. \nHowever,  heavy  agricultural  activities  and  growing  urbanization  in  the  lake  basin  have \nposed greater risks of water pollution in the lake. The water quality of Dongjiang Lake has been \ndeteriorating  since  the  1990s  as  a  result  of  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  inadequate \nwastewater  treatment  facilities,  lack  of  solid  waste  management,  and  significant  soil  erosion \naround the lake. The trophic state index for Dongjiang Lake was 25.8 in 1991 and 29.5 in 2010.3 \nAlthough the 2010 trophic state index is acceptable for drinking purposes, the value in 2010 was \nsignificantly  higher  than  in  1991.  A  review  of  15  monitoring  stations  from  1991  to  2010  has \nshown that Dongjiang Lake is generally in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. However, \namong the  15  locations,  water quality  in 12  locations  was poorer  in 2010  than  in 1991. Water \nquality fluctuations are random and without a significant seasonal pattern or synchronization, so \nthe pollution challenges are not likely from a single source.  \n\n9. \nPoint and nonpoint source pollution. Agriculture is the major source of pollution in the \nlake  catchment,  accounting  for  about  48%  of  the  total  pollutants.  Other  sources  include \ndomestic wastewater (25%), industry (14%), water transportation (9%), and tourism (4%). Every \nyear,  the  pollutants  discharged  into  the  Dongjiang  Lake  area  contain  9,038  tons  of  chemical \noxygen  demand,  1,741  tons  of  ammonia,  and  363  tons  of  total  phosphorus.  Only  a  few \ntownships  have  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  and  the  wastewater  from  most  townships  and \nvillages scattered around the lake is directly discharged to the streams that drain to the lake. \n\n10. \nSolid waste collection and treatment facilities for townships and villages have yet  to be \nestablished in the basin. As the population increases, garbage production also rises. Only a few \nvillages have household trash collectors or collection bins in designated locations. Furthermore, \npublic  collection  tanks  are  often  not  emptied  on  time  and  overflow  of  rubbish  is  common. \nConsequently,  garbage  is  discarded  on  roadsides  and  open  spaces  around  houses.  This  not \nonly has an adverse visual impact on the surrounding environment, but also seriously threatens \nthe  health  of  local  villagers.  Because  of  the  lack  of  transfer  and  disposal,  rubbish  has  been \nstacked on unused land. Some villages burn their rubbish, causing significant adverse impacts \nto the surrounding environment and the living conditions of local residents. \n\n11. \nInadequate  water  supply  facilities.  A  large  number  of  residents,  particularly  rural \ncommunities in Zixing City, do not have access to piped water supply, although they are close to \nthe lake. They use water drawn from various sources without proper treatment. This is not only \na burden for  the residents,  but  also  exposes them  to  health risks  and,  in turn,  affects  the  lake \nwater  quality.  The  existing  water  treatment  plants  in  the  towns  of  Zixing  City  use  surrounding \nsmall-scale  water  reservoirs  and  mountain  springs  or  rivers  as  water  sources,  but  these  are \nsubject  to  seasonal  changes  and  weak  self-purification  capacity  during  drought.  The  villages \nbeyond  the  service  area  of  existing  water  supply  plants  are  served  by  small-scale  temporary \n                                                \n3  The trophic state index is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is in a lake or other \n\nbody of water. A lake can be put into one of three possible classes: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fwater  supplies,  which  have  lower  safety  standards.  Most  rural  residents  drink  well  water  or \nstream  water  of  poor  sanitary  quality,  especially  during  rainy  seasons  when  wells  are  often \nflooded,  seriously  polluted,  and  of  extremely  turbid  water  quality.  Furthermore,  some  rural \nvillages are located within high-fluorine and high-arsenic areas. \n\n12. \nLow  flood  protection  level.  With  the  large  flood  storage  capacity  of  Dongjiang  Lake, \nthe downstream of the lake has been protected from major floods. However, the flood protection \nof  the  upstream  and  surrounding  areas  of  the  lake  is  low,  with  capacity  only  against  flood \nrecurrence of about 2 years. The rivers have been frequently impacted by floods over the years, \nresulting  in  river  blockage  and  bank  erosion  that  reduce  flood  discharge  capacity.  Most  of  the \nrivers  do  not  have  bank  protection,  which  results  in  erosion  of  neighboring  farmland  during \nfloods  and  causes  sedimentation  in  the  rivers.  Frequent  floods  have  brought  extreme  impacts \non  the  lives  and  production  of  the  riparian  villagers.  Farmers  particularly  suffer  from  loss  of \nproperties,  farmlands,  or  even  life.  For  example,  a  severe  flood  in  July  2006  caused \n142 casualties, 2,563 collapsed houses, and 200 hectares (ha) of damaged farmland. \n\nSoil erosion and ecosystem. Limited livelihood and employment opportunities and lack \n13. \nof arable land result in the conversion of slopes for farming by local communities. In the areas \naround  Dongjiang  Lake,  soil  erosion  is  intensifying  and  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  is \nincreasing.  Soil  erosion  in  the  project  area  covers  1,087  km2  and  average  annual  soil  erosion \nreaches  4 million  tons,  causing  river  siltation  in  some  sections  of  the  rivers  and  even  forming \nsand deltas at some river estuaries to Dongjiang Lake. The 55,000 ha of national and provincial \npublic  forest  around  the  lake  area  greatly  contribute  to  water  and  soil  conservation.  However, \nfires  and  pest  disasters  often  occur  because  of  the  low  quality  of  the  forest,  and  the  eco-\nefficiency  of  the  forest  is  relatively  low.  The  lake  areas  are  abundant  with  bamboo resources, \nand can be a major source of income for local residents while protecting the environment. \n\n14. \nInadequate  institutional  coordination  and  capacity.  Dongjiang  Lake  basin  covers \nZixing City and the counties of Guidong, Rucheng, and Yizhang in Chenzhou Municipality. The \nDongjiang  Lake  environmental  protection  bureau  was  established  under  the  Chenzhou \nMunicipal  Government  in  2003  to  coordinate  environmental  protection  in  the  basin.  However, \nthe  bureau  does  not  have  (i)  adequate  tools  and  capacity  for  coordinating  and  monitoring \nenvironmental  protection  activities  in  the  entire  basin,  or  (ii)  an  ecological  and  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  information  system.  It  needs  to  be  empowered  with  adequate \nhuman  and financial  resources to assume  responsibility  for  environmental  management  of  the \nentire lake basin. \n\nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  building  a \n15. \nharmonious  and  prosperous  society \nthrough  regionally  balanced  and  environmentally \nsustainable  growth.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt \nInitiative  to  construct  an ecological  ecosystem  corridor  along the  river  by improving  watershed \nmanagement, water pollution control and prevention, and ecological rehabilitation.4 It conforms \nto the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,5 and the Water Operational \nPlan,  2011\u20132020  to  increase  coverage  and  improve  services  for  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nand promote integrated water resources management (IWRM).6 \n \n\n                                                \n4  State  Council  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  2014.

The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  previous  ADB-financed \n16. \nprojects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on  IWRM,  environmental  and  ecosystem  improvement, \nwetland and lake management, and urban\u2013rural integration in the PRC. Major lessons include \n(i)  an  integrated  approach  of  structural  and  nonstructural  measures  to  water  resources \nfor \nmanagement;  (ii)  wide  community  participation  and \nenvironmental  improvement;  (iii)  linking  environmental  protection  with  livelihood  opportunities; \n(iv)  coordinated  management  of  urban\u2013rural  planning,  and  management  of  resources  and \nservices  to  facilitate  integration  and  linkage  to  infrastructure;  (v)  an  institutional  and  cost \nrecovery  mechanism  for  effective  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  facilities;  and \n(vi) eco-compensation as an effective tool for maintaining environmental services. \n\nincreased  public  awareness \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe impact will be the achievement of sustainable economic development of the Xiang \nRiver  basin  in  Hunan  Province.  The  outcome  will  be  the  achievement  of  integrated \nenvironmental protection in Dongjiang Lake basin. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe project will have five outputs: (i) improved pollution control, (ii) establishment of an \nurban\u2013rural  water  supply  system,  (iii)  a  rehabilitated  river  course,  (iv)  establishment  of \nintegrated ecosystem rehabilitation and management, and (v) strengthened environmental and \nproject management capacity. \n\nOutput 1 will include (i) construction of six township wastewater treatment plants with a \n19. \ntotal capacity of 2,000 m3/day, and associated sewage collection pipes of 38.1 kilometers (km); \n(ii)  construction  of  2,856  small-scale  wastewater  treatment  facilities  for  rural  villages  in \n10 townships,  and  associated  sewer  pipes  of  about  330  km;  (iii)  procurement  of  solid  waste \ncollection  and  compaction  equipment,  and  seven  transfer  facilities;  and  (iv)  development  of \nnonpoint  source  pollution  management,  including  soil  test  and  green  fertilizer  application,  and \ngreen pest control measures application in 5,690 ha of farmland. \n\nOutput  2  will  include  (i)  construction  of  the  Yangdongxia  water  supply  plant,  with  total \n20. \nwater  treatment  capacity  of  20,000  m3/day  for  the  water  supply  of  128,688  residents  in  five \ntownships, associated water delivery and supply pipelines with a total length of about 700 km, \nand pressure regulating stations; (ii) construction of Chukou water supply plant, with capacity of \n620 m3/day for supply to 3,200 residents, and associated water delivery and supply pipelines of \nabout 35 km; and (iii) procurement of O&M equipment. \n\n21. \nOutput  3  will  improve  the  flood  protection  standard  and  reduce  the  soil  erosion  of  five \nmajor rivers of Guangqiao, Lianping, Qingyao, Tian\u2019eshan, and Xingning that flow into the lake, \nincluding  block  clearance  and  dredging  of  653,692  m3  (14.7  km),  green  embankment  of \n13.7 km, and landscaping along the riverbanks. \n\nOutput 4 will include (i) establishing aquatic facilities and management; (ii) constructing \n22. \nthree wetlands for about 167 ha, and management facilities; (iii) conducting soil erosion control, \nincluding 1,000 ha of reforestation and revegetation, natural enhancement and management of \n13,666 ha of public forest, constructing 590 km of fire breaks, and procuring firefighting facilities; \n(iv) improving 2,595 ha of bamboo forest; (v) conducting alternative livelihood training for 30,000 \nrural residents; and (vi) carrying out an eco-compensation pilot scheme. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fOutput  5  will  support  the  (i)  establishment  of  environmental,  fishery,  and  forest \n23. \nfirefighting  monitoring  centers;  (ii)  establishment  of  the  Dongjiang  Lake  ecological  and \nenvironmental  protection \nthe  Dongjiang  Lake \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management  information  system;  (iv)  provision  of  project \nimplementation consulting services, training, workshops, and study tours; and (v) establishment \nof a project monitoring and evaluation system. \n\n(iii)  development  of \n\nresearch  center; \n\n24. \nInnovation  and  special  features.  The  project  is  expected  to  scale  up  and/or \ndemonstrate the following good practices in the PRC: (i) IWRM and comprehensive monitoring, \n(ii)  environmental  protection  linked  with  livelihood  improvement,  and  (iii)  eco-compensation.  In \naddition,  during  project  preparation,  policy  dialogue  was  conducted  and  recommendations \nprovided for revising the Dongjiang Lake Basin Water Environmental Protection Regulation.7 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIntegrated  water  resources  management.  Under  the  IWRM  framework,  the \nproject  attempts  to  coordinate  and  integrate  the  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures  in  a  manner  that  ensures  their  consistency  and  results  in  synergies \nwhere the total impact is greater than the sum of the individual actions. To meet \nthe  water  quality  targets  as  requested  in  the  national  good  water  quality  lake \nprogram, pollutants discharged into the lake have to be reduced. The project will \ntake a holistic approach to tackling these challenges by preventing different types \nland  degradation  and  soil  erosion,  with  a \nof  pollution  sources,  and \ncomprehensive  environmental  monitoring  system  to  support  integrated  lake \nmanagement. \nLinking  environmental  protection with  livelihood  opportunities.  The project \nwill not only maintain environmental and ecological services to the local residents \nand the downstream Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan city cluster, but also improve \nlocal  farmers\u2019  income  by  directly  supporting  livelihood  opportunities,  such  as \nbamboo  forest  development,  fish  stocking,  and  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training in alternative livelihood activities for 30,000 rural residents \naround the lake. Without such benefits, the willingness of local farmers to comply \nwith environmental regulations around the lake would not be fully effective. \nEco-compensation.  Dongjiang  Lake  performs  crucial  watershed  functions  for \nHunan  Province.  An  eco-compensation  pilot  scheme  will  be  tested  under  the \nproject to compensate those responsible for the collection and treatment of solid \nwaste  and  sewage,  and  engagement  of  greener  agricultural  production,  by \nsetting  up  an  eco-compensation  fund  to  be  raised  from  tourist  entry  fees.  HPG \nto  explore  more  eco-\nand  Zixing  City  Government  (ZCG)  also  agreed \ncompensation  schemes  for  better  protection  of  Dongjiang  Lake  during  project \nimplementation. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $262.03  million  (Table  1).

The technical feasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed \nexamination  of  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local  conditions,  including  current  and  projected \nclimate variables, availability of water sources, proximity to the residents, and available land for \nproject facilities. Alternative technical options identified the most suitable sites for the facilities, \nand  the  different  forms  of  river  embankments  and  wetlands  to suit  the  local  environment.  The \nprocesses selected for the urban and rural water supply, and wastewater and sludge treatment, \nare appropriate for the technical capacity of the local implementing agency. Capacity building to \nensure adequate skills for project implementation and O&M will be financed under the project. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-\nproject  scenarios.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for  construction, \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nincluding  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  monitoring \ncosts; and (ii) annual O&M costs. The economic benefits for the project were derived from the \nwillingness  to  pay  of  beneficiaries  for  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste \ncollection;  avoided  flood  and  forest  fire  damage;  water  treatment  and  resource  cost  savings \nfrom wetland protection; reduced soil erosion; and increased quantity and quality of fruit, forest, \nand fishery products. The overall economic internal rate of return was estimated at 14.5%; and \nthe net present value is CNY156.75 million, indicating the economic viability of the project. \n\nThe financial sustainability assessment for the  project indicates that ZCG has sufficient \n31. \nfunds  to  finance  the  counterpart  contributions,  debt  service,  and  O&M  costs.  Average  annual \ncounterpart  funding  accounts  for  0.5%\u20132.4%  of  ZCG\u2019s  total  projected  revenue  during \nimplementation. The  sum  of  counterpart funds, debt  service,  and O&M  costs  is  1.2%\u20133.2% of \nthe  total  projected  revenues  during  2016\u20132040.  The  financial  evaluation  indicated  that  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  for  Yangdongxia  water  supply  was  3.14%,  higher  than  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.45%; while the financial internal rate of return for Chukou \nwater supply was 5.24%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.70%. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the Yangdongxia water supply is sensitive to revenue decrease. Financial \nevaluation of the township wastewater treatment plants determined that full O&M cost recovery \nis  not  possible  at  reasonable  tariff  assumptions,  given  their  small  scale.  ZCG  will  provide \nsubsidies needed to partly cover O&M expenses for township wastewater treatment facilities. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  ZCG  and  ZIFC  have  the \nnecessary  technical  and  human  resources  to  undertake  procurement  of  consulting  services, \ngoods, and works; and (ii) monitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally \nin  place.  The  financial  management  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  both  ZCG  and  ZIFC  have \nadequate  and  qualified  staff  for  operating  and  administering  the  project  account,  and  (ii)  its \ninternal  control  and  audit  will  be  strengthened  through  capacity  building  and  close  monitoring \nduring project implementation. The financial management risk has been assessed as moderate \non  a  pre-mitigation  basis  mainly  because  of  unfamiliarity  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management \npolicies and procedures. To address these risks, the key mitigating measures include provision \nof  training  and  consulting  services.  With  mitigating  measures,  these  financial  management \narrangements are deemed adequate. \n\n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  HPG,  ZCG,  and  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 8). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n34. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  78,325  households,  of  which  10.8%  are  low-income \n(CNY10,000/year  and  below). 11  The  project  has  good  opportunities  for  socially  inclusive \nbenefits, which will provide farmers around the lake with adequate awareness and incentives to \nprotect the lake environment. The project design focuses on ways to balance environmental and \nsocial objectives, and thereby maintain the ecological quality of the lake, while maintaining good \nincomes for people with livelihoods around the lake. A social development action plan has been \nprepared  to  ensure  actions  are  taken  to  consult  with  and  mobilize  local  communities  to  shift \n                                                \n11 These include 58,425 households with new or improved sanitation, 42,188 households with new or improved water \nsupply, 10,273 households with reduced flood risks, and 26,650 households with rehabilitated bamboo forest. The \nsum is larger than the total beneficiary households because some households benefit from several activities.      \n\n\faway  from  detrimental  activities  and  behaviors.  This  will  be  supported  by  livelihood  training \nprograms  and  public  awareness  campaigns  for  sanitation  and  environmental  protection.  A \ncommunity consultation and participation plan has been prepared for project implementation to \nengage local communities\u2019 active participation in the implementation of several project outputs. \n\n35. \nGender.  ADB  has  classified  the  project  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Good \nopportunities  exist  for  women  to  participate  in  project  design,  implementation,  construction \nemployment,  and  project  activities,  particularly  in  livelihood  training,  wetland  construction  and \nmanagement,  bamboo  upgrading,  and  public  awareness  programs.  Women  will  also  benefit \nfrom the wastewater treatment, solid waste management, and water supply components, which \nwill  greatly  improve their  living  conditions.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared.  ZCG  and \nZIFC will require social and gender awareness training and support during implementation, and \nthe project implementation consultants for social and gender issues will be provided. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report, \n36. \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  follows  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  EIA  is  consistent  with  the  domestic  EIAs.  The  draft  EIA  report  was \npublicly  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  27  April  2015.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve \nenvironmental  benefits,  including  improved  long-term  security  of  the  high  water  quality  in \nDongjiang Lake; improved wetland habitats; soil erosion control; and improved institutional and \ncommunity  management  of  water,  wetland,  and  forestry  resources.  Anticipated  construction \nimpacts are from dredging and embankment of the rivers; construction-related air, dust, noise, \nvibration,  and  erosion  impacts;  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety.  Potential \noperational risks include cumulative nutrient loading in Dongjiang Lake and  the rivers resulting \nfrom  the  discharge  of  treated  effluent;  inadequate  maintenance  of  the  treatment  plants, \npipelines, and constructed wetlands; and air and noise emissions from the treatment plants. The \nrisk  of  cumulative  and/or  induced  impacts  has  been  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  are \ndescribed in the EMP. These include the timing of dredging, on-site sediment sampling, control \nof  sediment  dispersion, and maintenance of  project facilities.  The  EIA  concludes that  effective \nimplementation  of the  EMP, together  with the training,  will  result  in  residual  impacts  within the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. The initial climate risk rating during the project \nconcept  stage  was  medium,  but  the  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  found  the  risk  to  be \nlow. Adaptation measures were included in the project design. \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  A  total  of  189.06  ha  of  land  will  be  occupied \n37. \npermanently,  including  12.28  ha  of  collective  land  and  176.77  ha  of  state-owned  land.  Some \n65.29 ha of land will be occupied temporarily. The project will demolish 1,539.1 square meters \nof housing. Land acquisition and resettlement will affect 573 people, of whom 284 will lose more \nthan 10% of their productive assets and/or be physically displaced. Seven households need to \nbe  relocated.  Livelihood  measures  and  training,  such  as  bamboo  forest  and  training  on  tea \nprocessing,  tourist  services,  computer  operation,  and  cooking,  will  be  provided  to  households \nwith  significant  land  losses.  ZCG,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  prepared  a  resettlement \nplan  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  government\u2019s  related  laws  and \nregulations.  ZCG  and  ZIFC  have  good  experience  and  capacity  to  manage  resettlement \nimpacts. The draft resettlement plan was disclosed on the ADB website on 2 July 2015. \n\nEthnic  minorities  (category  B).  Yao  people  in  four  villages  will  benefit  from  several \n38. \nproject activities, including bamboo forest, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, river \nrehabilitation, wetland development, and livelihood training. A draft ethnic minority development \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nplan  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  related  laws  and \nregulations  of  the  PRC  and  Hunan  Province.  Actions  to  be  taken  include  community \nconsultation  and  mobilization  to  ensure  Yao  people  can  participate  in  project  design, \nconstruction, and benefits in a manner that supports culturally appropriate village development. \nThe draft ethnic minority development plan was disclosed on the ADB website on 2 July 2015. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe project has potential environmental, institutional, and financial risks. The overall risk \n39. \nis  assessed  as medium. The  project  provides  adequate measures  to  mitigate these  risks,  and \nthe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.12  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will help strengthen and empower the local government and relevant \nagencies to carry out environmental monitoring and protection in a coordinated \nand holistic manner. \n\nZixing City Government will ensure adequate staff resources and annual operation \nand maintenance budget in accordance with loan covenants. The project includes \ncapacity development and training for the operation and maintenance of the \nfacilities supported by the project. \n\nRisks \nThe local government fails to \nadopt an integrated approach to \nthe Dongjiang Lake\u2019s \nenvironmental protection. \nInfrastructure assets are poorly \noperated and maintained \nbecause of lack of capacity \nand/or budget. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n40. \nThe government, HPG, and ZCG have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government,  HPG,  and  ZCG  have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the  loan of  $130,000,000 to the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China for the  Hunan  Dongjiang \nLake Integrated Environmental Protection and Management Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\nStephen P.
