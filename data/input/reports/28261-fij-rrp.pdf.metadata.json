The Project  is  well  advanced,  with only the  ongoing \nupgrading  of  subproject  roads  still  to  be  completed.  There  are \nenvironmental  management  plans  for  the  remaining  subproject \nand  these  are  being  implemented  by  the  contractors  and \nmonitored  by  the  supervising  consultants  and  the  ministries  of \ntourism and the environment.  \n \nThe  Project  contributes \nthe  Government\u2019s  objectives  of \neconomic  and  social  development  by  reducing  transport  sector \nconstraints  on  economic  development  and \nthe \neconomic  returns  on  transport  infrastructure.  It  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s program to improve the national road network and \nthe  management  of  roads.  The  supplementary  loan  will  finance  \n50 kilometers (km) of road upgrading, which was partly completed \nunder the original loan. \n \nLand transport is the dominant form of transport in the Fiji Islands. \nWhile the road network is largely complete, a large proportion still \nconsists of low-standard gravel roads, where the vehicle operating \ncosts are high. These roads impede socioeconomic development, \nlengthen  travel  time,  and  cause  damage  to  transported  goods. \nThey  are  inadequate  for  current  traffic  loads.  Traffic  volume  is \nroads.  \nincreasing  and  heavy  vehicles  are  damaging \nthe \nUpgrading \nincome-generating \nopportunities, particularly for small-scale dairy, fruit, and vegetable \nfarmers,  and  reduce  transport  costs.  The  population  will  benefit \nfrom \nto  health  and \neducational services. \n \nThe Project will lead to economic and social development, and to \nreduced  hardship  and  poverty.  It  will  improve  access  to  services \nand  markets,  thereby providing better  opportunities for economic \nand social development. \n \nThe  revised cost  of the Project  is  estimated at  US$162.1  million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  US$33.9  million.  The  project  cost \noverrun  is  estimated  to  be  US$72.1  million,  including  taxes  and \nduties of US$16.2 million. \n \n\nroads  will  expand \n\ntransportation \n\nless  costly \n\nfaster  and \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nSupplementary \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nA  loan  of  US$36.1  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  to  the \nBorrower  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  20  years \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  2  years,  an  interest  rate  determined \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% yearly, and other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Government  will  provide \nUS$36.0 million, or 50% of the cost overrun. \n \n15 March 2009 to 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nDepartment of National Roads (DNR) in the Ministry of Works and \nTransport  \n \nThe permanent  secretary of  the  Ministry  of Works  and  Transport \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nexisting project management unit will continue to administer daily \nactivities  under  the  director  of  roads.  Local  and  international \ncontractors  and  the  DNR  will  carry  out  the  civil  works,  and \nconsultants  will  be  hired  for  preconstruction  activities,  including \ntender  documents,  and  for  construction \nthe  preparation  of \nsupervision and quality control. \n \nRoads  will  be  upgraded  under  contracts  to  be  awarded  through \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \ninternational  competitive  bidding \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nAn ongoing contract package for the supply of pavement materials \nwas  approved  by  ADB  in  2006.  The  balance  of  the  cost  not \nfinanced by the original loan will be eligible for financing under the \nsupplementary loan.  \n \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  supervise \nthe \nconstruction  of  the  remaining  road  upgrading  subproject.  The \nBorrower  will  select  and  hire  competent  and  experienced \nconsultants  acceptable  to  ADB  to  carry  out  the  assignment.  The \nterms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  will  be  determined by ADB \nthe \nand \nsupervision arrangements will have to be approved by ADB. DNR \nwill  see  to  it  that  competent  and  experienced  consultants \nacceptable to ADB are hired to supervise the civil works. \n \n\nthe  DNR.

The  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  will \naccrue  from  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and  time  savings. \nIndirect benefits will include improved access of rural communities \nto  basic  social  facilities,  as  well  as  improved  socioeconomic \nconditions in the areas served by the upgraded roads. \n \nThe completion of the remaining subproject is subject to technical \nrisks  that  are  largely  within  the  control  of  the  Executing  Agency. \nThese  risks  can  be  satisfactorily  mitigated  through  sound  project \nmanagement and supervision. \n\n \n\n\f177  00'Eo\n\n12  40'So\n\n12  40'So\n\nRotuma\n\n177  00'Eo\n\n178  00'Eo\n\n180  00'o\n\nN O R T H E R N     D I V I S I O N\n\nLabasa\n\nREPUBLIC OF THE FIJI ISLANDS\nTHIRD ROAD UPGRADING\n(SECTOR) PROJECT\n\nV A N U A     L E V U\n\nSavusavu\n\nTaveuni Coast Road\n\nWaiyevo\n\nBuca Bay Road\n\nTAVEUNI\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n17  00'So\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nVanua Balavu\n\n17  00'So\n\nY A S A W A     G R O U P\n\nNabouwalu\n\nW E S T E R N     D I V I S I O N\n\nBa\n\nKings Road\n\nRakiraki\n\nTavua\n\nLautoka\n\nWailoaloa Road\n\nEnamanu Road\n\nSigatoka\n\nNadi\n\nV I T I     L E V U\n\nL O M A I V I T I\nG R O U P\n\nKoro\n\nNairai\n\nNatovi\n\nLodoni Road\n\nLevuka\n\nOVALAU\n\nSawani Road\n\nK  o  r  o         S  e  a\n\nNausori\n\nGau\n\nE  A  S  T  E  R  N         D  I  V  I  S  I  O  N\n\nL A U     O R     E A S T E R N     G R O U P\n\nSUVA\n\nNavua\n\nBeqa\n\nC E N T R A L     D I V I S I O N\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\n180  00'o\n\nP  A  C  I  F  I  C          O  C  E  A  N\n\nNational Capital\n\nProject Road\n\nTown\n\nRoad\n\nRiver\n\nDivision Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nVunisea\n\nKADAVU\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n178  00'Eo\n\n19  00'So\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n3\n3\n4\n \nH\nR\n\n19  00'So\n\nINDONESIA\n\nPAPUA\nNEW GUINEA\n\n20  00'No\n\nPhilippine\nSea\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF PALAU\n\n0o\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nMARSHALL  ISLANDS\n\nPACIFIC  REGION\n\n20  00'No\n\nI\nn\nt\ne\nr\nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \n \n\nD\na\nt\ne\n\nl\ni\n\nn\ne\n\nFEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\n\nNAURU\n\nSOLOMON\nISLANDS\n\nTUVALU\n\nK     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\n\n0o\n\nC o r a l   S e a\n\nVANUATU\n\nSAMOA\n\nTONGA\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF THE\nFIJI\nISLANDS\n\nCOOK\nISLANDS\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nA U S T R A L I A\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji  Islands  for  the  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector) \nProject (FRUP III).1 \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nTransport  services for both  passengers  and freight on  the  main  islands of  Vanua Levu \nand  Viti  Levu  rely  heavily  on  roads.  Although  the  road  network  is  largely  complete,  however, \nmuch of it is built to a low standard. Travel by road takes longer, transported goods are prone to \ndamage,  and  socioeconomic  development  suffers.  Heavy  vehicles  on  roads  not  designed  for \nthe growing traffic volume and axle loads also do serious harm. On the other hand, because of \ninadequate capacity on some national trunk roads, particularly circular roads and wharf access \nroads,  uneconomic  routes  are  often  chosen.  Rising  transport  costs,  which  hinder  economic \ngrowth, make the upgrading of roads necessary. The subprojects under FRUP Ill were selected \non  the  basis  of  passenger  traffic  volume,  the  transport  requirements  of  international  and \ndomestic trade, and demand created by tourism. \n \n3. \nThe Asian  Development Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  operational  strategy supports  the  Government \nin  its  policy  of  improving  transport  infrastructure  in  the  wider  economic  policy  context  of \npromoting  private  sector  development,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and  delivering  better \nsocial  services.  Road  upgrading  is  a  key  component  of  the  National  Transport  Sector  Plan, \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy of supporting high-yielding projects. ADB\u2019s aim in the Pacific region \ncontinues  to  be  the  creation  of  an  environment  of  improved  productivity,  increased  private \nsector investment, and sustained economic growth. In line with ADB\u2019s strategy for the Pacific,2 \nFRUP  III  (the  Project)  addressed  the  improvement  of  physical  infrastructure,  a  key  factor  in \neconomic  growth.  Through  associated  technical  assistance  (TA),3 ADB  supported  significant \npolicy reform and capacity building in the sector. The background, policy issues, sector analysis, \nand  institutional  framework  are  fully  described  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident for the original loan. \n \nB. \n \n \n\nObjectives and Scope of the Original Project \n\nObjectives \n\n1. \n\n4. \nThe original Project was aimed at helping the Government to (i) improve the efficiency of \nroad sector services and increase private sector participation, and (ii) improve the management \nof  road assets  and  sector  resources.  The  intent was  to  reduce  transport  sector  constraints  on \neconomic  development,  and  thus  improve  the  economic  returns  on  transport  infrastructure. \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  1997.

The  detailed \noriginal and revised cost estimate is shown in Table 1. \n \n\nOriginal Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n8. \nThe ADB loan of US$40.0 million, about 44% of the project cost, comprised (i) US$34.3 \nmillion  in  civil  works  for  the  road  upgrading  subprojects  (60%  of  category  costs);  (ii)  US$3.5 \nmillion in road rehabilitation (35% of category costs); (iii) US$1.2 million equivalent in civil works \nfor  safety  improvements  (34%  of  category  costs);  and  (iv)  US$1.0  million  equivalent  in \nspecialized  maintenance  and  laboratory  equipment  (100%  of  category  costs).  The  rest  of  the \nproject costs, including interest during construction, were to be met from the Government\u2019s own \nresources. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe US dollar loan came from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It had an amortization \n9. \nperiod  of  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  carried  interest  determined \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  yearly \ncommitment charge of 0.75%. In 2002, the undisbursed balance of the loan was transferred to \nthe London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility. The original and revised financing \nplan is in Table 2. \n \nD. \n \n10. \n \n\nStatus and Progress of Project Implementation \n\nThe status of project implementation is as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n50 km of roads have been upgraded, out of the expected 100 km. A subproject \n(the  upgrading  of  the  Kings  and  Lodoni  roads,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  \u201cthe \nsubproject\u201d) for the balance of 50 km is ongoing and is about 50% complete. \n120 km of road rehabilitation has been completed, 40 km more than the expected \noutput of 80 km. This work was completed by December 2005, within the activity \ncategory budget. \nAll civil works for road safety improvements in road infrastructure were completed \nby December 2005. \nAll  specialized  road  maintenance  and  laboratory  equipment  was  procured  by \nDecember 2005. \nAll consulting services, except for those needed for the construction supervision \nof the ongoing subproject, were delivered by December 2005. \n\n \nThe  associated  TA  (footnote  3)  was  completed  in  June  2005.  Its  intended  objectives \n11. \nwere generally achieved and the TA was rated partly successful.4 The TA assisted the Ministry \nof  Works  and  Transport  in  developing  and  implementing  institutional  and  policy  reform  by \nestablishing  the  Land  Transport  Authority  and  the  Department  of  National  Roads  (the  latter \nbeing  the  first  stage  of  a  two-step  process  to  establish  a  Fiji  Roads  Authority).  But  the \nimplementation  time  frame  was  considerably  extended  and  the  institutional  reform  was  only \npartly accomplished. The reform efforts were to continue under a proposed loan for the Fourth \nRoad  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project  (FRUP  IV)  and  associated  TA for  Road  Sector  Performance \nImprovement. Together these were to support the transition of the roads authority from a public \nsector road agency to a statutory authority, with maximum involvement from the private sector \nand  performance-based  management.  Unfortunately,  ADB\u2019s  reengagement  approach5 halted \nthe processing of the FRUP IV and much of the momentum for the reform of the road transport \nsector was lost. The process should be revived once reengagement allows FRUP IV to proceed. \n \n12. \nEfforts  at  systematic  and  responsive  road  asset  management  under  the  Project  were \ngenerally  successful,  but  still  require  the  following  elements  for  long-term  sustainability: \n(i) government  commitment  to  fully  fund  road  maintenance,  which  depends  in  part  on  a \ndedicated stream of road funding; (ii) a continuing human resources program to recruit and train \nstaff  and  replace  incumbents  who  are  promoted  or  move  to  other  jobs;  (iii)  government \nbudgetary support,  including  the use  of  external suppliers,  to  maintain  software and hardware \nsystems so these do not become outdated or obsolete; (iv) rebranding and reissue of manuals \nand  guidelines  prepared  for  the  Public Works  Department;  (v)  a  formalized  and  appropriately \nfunded bridge replacement program; (vi) a dedicated budget item for emergency maintenance; \n\n                                                \n4   ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(vii)  quality  control  systems  for  force  account  and  contracted  maintenance  works;  (viii)  more \ntimely,  complete,  and  accurate  entry  of  data  on  road  inventory  and  condition  in  the  divisions; \n(ix) integrated  road  asset  management  and  financial  information  systems;  and  (x)  support  for \nthe outsourcing of maintenance activities through the training of Department of National Roads \n(DNR)  staff  in  contract  supervision,  and  of  domestic  contractors  in  labor,  plant,  and  materials \nmanagement,  estimation, and  business  management. While  the Project  improved  capacity for \nroad asset management, the Executing Agency (EA) was unable to retain or replace staff, partly \nbecause momentum toward the long-term sustainability of institutional arrangements for sector \nmanagement was lost. The EA is now looking into twinning arrangements to firm up its position \nand help it to move forward in a way that accords with plans to establish a roads authority. The \nProject  also  provided  only  limited  opportunities  for  domestic  contractors  in  small-scale  civil \nworks  including  road  rehabilitation  and  road  safety  improvements.  One  reason  was  the \npreponderance  of  work  under  force  account,  beyond  the  level  foreseen  at  appraisal.  Private \nsector  capacity  has  thus  diminished  as  the  few  opportunities  have  discouraged  investment  in \nnew  equipment. Government  has  therefore  had  to  rely  even  more on  works by force account, \ncontrary  to  the  aims  of  the  Project.  In  subsequent  projects,  contracts  suitable  in  scale  for  the \nlocal contracting industry should be included in the implementation plan. \n\n \nThe status of progress of the subproject is as follows: \n\n13. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEarthworks  and  drainage  have  been  completed  for  30  km  out  of  the  total  of \n50 km. \nPavement works have been completed to the subbase level for 22 km out of the \ntotal of 50 km. \nPavement  works for base  course  and  bituminous  sealing have been  completed \nfor 2 km out of the total of 50 km. \nAll bridgeworks, comprising 16 two-lane concrete bridges, have been completed. \n\n \nTwo  civil  works  contracts  are  ongoing.  The  contract  to  complete  the  pavement  to  the \n14. \nsubbase level over 29 km is expected to be completed by February 2009. The other contract, to \nproduce  pavement  materials  to  supply  the  material  needs of  the  subproject,  will  continue  until \nthose needs are fully met. \n \n15. \nEleven  km  of  road,  including  earthworks, drainage, and pavement,  is being  built under \nthe  Government\u2019s  force  account  arrangements,  involving  local  plant-hire  contractors,  local \nmaterials  suppliers,  and  a  government  project  management  team.  This  work  is  about  15% \ncomplete. \n \n16. \nThe Government has received bids for two other contracts\u2014(i) the construction of base \ncourse  and  seal  over  29  km  of  the  subproject;  and  (ii)  the  construction  of  10  km  of  road, \nincluding  earthworks,  drainage,  and  pavement.  The  bids  conformed  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) including prior review of bidding documents by \nADB.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  cost  of  completing  the  Project  is  now  estimated  to  be  US$162.1  million,  US$72.1 \nmillion more than originally expected. The cost overrun is almost entirely due to the increased \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcost  of  completing  the  subproject  (the  civil  works  for  the  upgrading  of  the  Kings  and  Lodoni \nroads).  \n \n18. \nIn January 2001, the subproject was awarded as a single contract through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB).6 When the bids were opened, the US dollar was relatively strong7 and \nit was thought that the cost of the subproject, although large by Fiji standards, could comfortably \nbe accommodated within the budget for the Project. At the same time, with anticipated savings \nfrom the strong US dollar, the EA increased the length of road rehabilitation under the Project \nfrom a planned 80 km to 120 km. The increase was achieved without exceeding the budget for \nthe road rehabilitation category of the original loan. \n \n19. \nBy  the  end  of  2005,  the  Project  had  been  completed  except  for  the  subproject,  which \nwas  only  35%  complete.  The  unit  rates  under  the  contract  had  gone  up  by  about  28%,  in \naccordance with a rise and fall provision, and the exchange rate had weakened. The estimated \nfinal  cost  had  jumped  from  F$57.3  million  (US$28.1  million  at  bid  opening)  to  F$74  million \n(about  US$41.5  million).  Even  with  the  substantial  increase,  the  cost  overrun  for  the  Project \nwould have been only about US$6 million, within the absorptive capacity of the Borrower. \n \n20. \nHowever,  the  contractor  stopped  working  in  August  2005  when  the  EA  deducted \nliquidated  damages  from  interim  payments  because  of  the  delay.  After  issuing  contractually \nrequired  notices  in  an  effort  to  persuade  the  contractor  to  resume  working,  the  supervising \nengineer certified to the EA that the contract had been breached by the contractor and could be \nterminated  by  the  EA.  The  Government  formed  a  cabinet  subcommittee  in  October 2005  to \nreview the circumstances surrounding the contractor\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Project and \nto consider alternative arrangements for completing the work. The committee decided that the \ncontractor had no reasonable excuse for abandoning the work, and agreed with the supervising \nengineer that claims for additional time and payment were groundless. The EA terminated the \ncontract in March 2006. While the committee\u2019s deliberations took some time, the EA proceeded \nin  parallel  to  prepare  a  revised  procurement  plan  and  associated  bidding  documents  for \ncompleting the works, thereby minimizing further delays. \n \n21. \nADB approved  the  revised procurement plan for completing  the  works,  comprising five \nICB  packages  and one force account  package. Bids  were  invited for  the first  three of the five \nICB  contracts  in  2006  but  the  accepted  tender  prices  were  significantly  above  the  rates  and \nprices  in  the  original  contract.  The  original  contract  price  was  based  on  prevailing  fuel  and \nmaterials prices and the relatively lower labor and management costs available to the contractor \nfrom  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  All  construction  inputs  have  since  undergone  further \nsignificant cost increases, particularly in fuel, oil, and materials costs (by a factor of at least two) \nover the last 2 years, such that the contract rates for the final two contracts are now three to four \ntimes higher than those in the original contract. With the delays caused by the poor performance \nof the contractor, the termination process, and the procurement of the new contract packages, \nthe Project is not expected to be completed before October 2011. \n \n22. \nThe  base  cost  of  completing  the  subproject  is  therefore  estimated  to  have  risen  from \nUS$28.1  million  to  about  US$87.0  million  (excluding  project  management  and  supervision \ncosts), or by US$58.9 million. The original financing plan provided for a civil works component \n\n                                                \n6  Kings and Lodoni roads, Contract No. QS 1/99 for F$57.3 million (about $28.1 million at bid opening), awarded to \nChina National Overseas Engineering Corporation on 24 January 2001. The estimated final cost is F$150.0 million \n(about $89.3 million). \n\n7  F$1.00 = US$0.72 at appraisal; F$1.00 = US$0.49 at bid opening. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fImpact on the Project \n\nunder  FRUP  III  of  US$76.9  million.  Largely  because  of  the  increased  costs  of  the  Kings  and \nLodoni roads component, the total cost of completing the civil works component of the Project is \nnow estimated to be US$135.3 million, including taxes and duties but excluding contingencies \nand additional financing costs during construction. \n \n23. \nThe  Government  has  given  notice  to  the  original  contractor  that  it  intends  to  pursue  a \nclaim  against  it,  in accordance  with the  contract,  to  recover  the additional costs  of  completing \nthe work, over and above the cost that would have been incurred had the work been completed \nat the rates and prices stated in the original contract. Such a claim cannot be pursued, however, \nuntil the actual cost of completing the work is known, and has been certified by the engineer for \nthe contract. The work is not expected to be completed before October 2011, and the claim will \nalmost certainly be resisted and require arbitration. This is likely to take a further 2 years, with \nuncertain  outcome,  given  the  nature  of  the  proceedings  and  the  likelihood  of  counterclaims \nagainst  the  Government  by  the  contractor.  While  the  Government  may  ultimately  succeed  in \nrecovering the cost overrun (in whole or in part), the supplementary finance is needed now to \nensure  the  completion  of  the  subproject  within  a  reasonable  time  and  to  prevent  the \ndeterioration  of  partially  completed  work.  Given  the  substantial  backlog  of  road  rehabilitation \nwork,  the  Government has agreed  that  if  it  is  able  to  recover  the  cost  overrun,  in  whole  or  in \npart, from  the  original  contractor,  the sums  will  be applied  to the extent  necessary,   to  priority \nroad rehabilitation as defined by the road asset management system, and to ensure adequate \nfunding of road maintenance. \n \nB. \n \nOnly  2  km  of  a  total  of  50  km  of  the  subproject  has  been  sealed  so  far;  the  rest  is  in \n24. \nvarying  stages  of  completion.  In  all  other  areas,  the  pavement  has  either  been  partially \ncompleted  to  the  subbase  (lower  pavement)  level  or  not  been  started.  Partially  completed \npavement cannot carry heavy axle loads and will suffer from accelerated deterioration, resulting \nin  loss  of  the  investment  made  so far.  Upgrading  a  road  to  sealed  standard  has  the  principal \nbenefit  of  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs  by  reducing  roughness,  improving  geometry,  and \nshortening  route  length.  The  partially  completed  work  captured  some  route-length  reductions \nand  improvements  in  geometry,  but  the  gravel  pavement  is  still  rough  and  vehicle  operating \ncosts remain high. All bridges\u201416 in all\u2014were completed by August 2008. Thirteen are in use, \nbut three cannot be used until the road realignments have been completed. \n \n25. \nThe  civil  works  under  the  subproject  will  have  an  impact  on  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, and on hardship and poverty reduction in the areas served by the roads. As the \nSubproject  is  a  significant part  of  the  overall  road  upgrading  component, failure to  complete  it \nwill significantly affect the overall impact of the Project. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  development  policy  objectives  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  draft  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  2007\u20132011  center  on  the  development  of  efficient  and  cost-effective \ninfrastructure for economic and social development and private sector investment, accompanied \nby  institutional  strengthening  for  more  capable  and  better-quality  facilities  and  services. \nStrategies for achieving these objectives include improving access to safe, efficient, affordable, \nand environmentally sustainable transport services; and reducing the cost of transporting people \nand  goods.  The  three  primary  goals  of  the  plan  are  sustained  growth,  rural  and  outer  island \ndevelopment,  and  efficient  transport  services.  The  Government\u2019s  overall  aim  for  the  transport \nsubsector,  given  in  the  Review  and  Update of the  Transport  Sector  Plan  (2004), supports  the \n\nRationale for the Completion of the Kings and Lodoni Roads Subproject \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fnational development objectives by targeting the development of an integrated transport system \nthat is safe, efficient, affordable, accessible, and economically and environmentally sustainable. \n \nThe  results-based  framework  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  2006\u201320088 \n27. \napproved in March 2006 supports the Government\u2019s objectives of (i) generating private sector\u2013\nled  growth  through  sound  macroeconomic  policies,  infrastructure,  and  alternative  livelihoods; \n(ii) delivering affordable basic social services through support for water and sanitation services, \nand  improvements  in  local governance;  and  (iii) establishing effective development  institutions \nthrough a sequenced and interlinked TA package. The preparation of a new country partnership \nstrategy 2007\u20132011 to support the country\u2019s Strategic Development Plan began in 2006 but was \nsuspended on 5 December of that year, after a peaceful takeover of the democratically elected \ngovernment by the Fiji military forces. \n \n28. \nThe  Kings  and  Lodoni  roads  serve  the  rural  and  impoverished  areas  of  the  east  and \nnortheast of the main island, Viti Levu. Kings Road (29 km from Korovou to Nayavu), the final \nsection  of  the  circum-insular  highway  to  be  upgraded  to  sealed  standard,  will  benefit  rural \ncommunities  by  establishing  regular  access  to  markets  and  services  in  the  Suva  area.  The \nmajority  of  the  rural  population  is  engaged  in  subsistence  farming;  some  sell  surplus  garden \nproduce at  roadside  stalls  to augment  their  income.  Previous  road-upgrading programs  in  the \nFiji Islands have shown that upgrading Kings Road will expand income-generating opportunities, \nparticularly for small-scale fruit and vegetable farmers in the surrounding Wainibuka valley, and \nreduce transport costs for dairy farmers along the southern part of the route. Improved access \nto Suva from the northeast of Viti Levu will also make the costs of transportation to health and \neducational  services  more  affordable \nthis  underdeveloped  and \ndisadvantaged area. \n \n29. \nLodoni  Road  (21  km)  serves  the  east  coast  to  the  north  of  Korovou.  The  rural \ncommunities  here  will  likewise  benefit  from  easier  access  to  the  greater  Suva  area,  as  will \nstudents  from  two  large  state  boarding  schools  served  by  the  road.  The  link  between  the \ninternational port of Suva and the roll-on, roll-off jetty at Natovi will improve, and land transport \ncosts will be reduced. The Natovi jetty serves both the second-largest island of Viti Levu and the \nisland of Ovalau. The reduction in land transport costs and the shorter sea route to Vanua Levu \n(5 hours, as opposed to 10 hours from Suva) will allow goods and services to be priced lower. \n \n30. \nfollowing reasons: \n \n\nThe  Project  is  eligible  for  supplementary  financing  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  criteria  for  the \n\nthe  population  of \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nThe  Project  supports  the  development  policy  objectives  set  out  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft Strategic Development Plan 2007\u20132011; \nSupplementary  financing  will  help  achieve  the  objectives  and  benefits  of  the \nProject; \nThe  subproject  roads  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  greater \nthan 12%, meeting the subproject selection criteria; \nNo supplementary financing was previously provided; and \nThe  amount  of  supplementary  financing  will  not  exceed  the  original  financing \napproved by ADB. \n\n \n31. \nof the Project is in Appendix 2. \n\nA design and monitoring framework for the subproject is in Appendix 1 and a chronology \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Fiji Islands. Manila. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s Reengagement Strategy \n\nD. \n \n32. \nADB is implementing a two-stage reengagement strategy (footnote 5) in the Fiji Islands \nfollowing  the  political  crisis  in  2006.  In  the  first  stage,  ADB  has  continued  to  support  ongoing \noperations, as it has ascertained that the interim government (i) effectively controls the country, \n(ii) generally recognizes the country\u2019s international obligations, (iii) is willing and able to assume \nall  of  its  predecessor\u2019s  obligations  to  ADB,  (iv)  can  ensure  the  continued  implementation  of \nongoing projects and programs, and (v) has authorized a representative to make withdrawals. \n \n33. \nADB  has  not  yet  proposed  a  resumption  of  formal  discussions  on  a  new  country \npartnership strategy or a new loan or TA. A proposal to resume full operations in the Fiji Islands \nwill  be  made  once  there  is  evidence  that  the  conditions  for  that  second  stage  of  the \nreengagement  strategy  exist.  The  Pacific  Department  will  regularly  assess  the  conditions  for \nnew  engagement.  Poverty  reduction  is  a  key  consideration  in  defining  new  lending  and \nnonlending priorities. FRUP III, on the other hand, is included in ADB\u2019s approved and ongoing \nprogram, and it needs supplementary financing to reach completion. Its cost overruns were due \nto  factors  such  as  the  impact  of  rising  global  commodity  prices  that  were  largely  beyond  the \ncontrol of the interim government. The significantly higher construction costs will use up the loan \nresources  before  the  Project  is  completed.  FRUP  III  is  estimated  to  be  about  75%  complete \noverall. If it is not completed the Project will not deliver its intended benefits to the poor, namely, \nregular  road  access  to  mainstream  markets  and  employment.  This  failure,  in  turn,  carries \nconsequences  for  (i)  the  country,  in  terms  of  worsening  poverty;  and  (ii) ADB,  in  terms  of \nreputation risk associated with not reaching the desired development outputs and outcomes. As \nfor the partially completed roads, significant areas (about 65% of the total length, or 33 km) will \ndeteriorate, resulting in partial loss of the investment and increased costs of future upgrading to \nsealed highway standard. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nThe  cost estimate for  the  completion  of  the  Project  (US$162.1  million)  is  based on  the \nactual  costs  incurred  thus  far  and  the  Government\u2019s  estimates  of  the  cost  of  completing  the \nsubproject,  including  taxes  and  duties.  The  estimates  are  based  on  (i)  rates  and  prices  of \nongoing  contract  packages,  (ii)  rates  and  prices  of  bids  received  for  remaining  contract \npackages, and (iii) the Government\u2019s estimate of the cost of completing a work section by force \naccount.  An  investment  plan  for  the  Project  including  cost  overrun  to  be  financed  by  the \nsupplementary loan is in Table 1 and a detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3. \n \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n(US$ million) \n\nOriginal \n\n \n\n \n\nCost  \nOverruna, b \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The loan will have a term of 20 years including a grace \nperiod of 2 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  yearly  commitment  charge  of 0.15%,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set forth  in  the \ndraft  loan  agreement.  The  proposed  loan  will  finance  the  civil  works  components  (excluding \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  the  subproject  that  have  been  or  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  The \nremaining  costs,  including  financing  charges  during  implementation,  will  be  met  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  own  resources.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility given these terms and conditions, \nand  (ii)  an  undertaking  to  the  effect  that  it  decided  independently,  without  relying  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.

DNR\u2019s existing FRUP III \nPMU,  staffed  by  a  project  management  engineer  and  a  qualified  accountant,  will  continue  to \nhandle procurement and oversee the consulting services, under the supervision of the director \nof  roads  and  airfields.  The  performance  of  the  PMU  in  implementing  the  Project  under  the \nexisting  sector  loan  has  been  satisfactory:  the  Project  (except  for  the  Kings  and  Lodoni \nSubproject) was completed by the end of 2005. However, a project procurement audit10 brought \nout  critical  deficiencies  in  documenting  project  expenditures,  particularly  for  force  account \nworks.  The  audit  report  urged  the  EA  to  strengthen  the  PMU  for  future  ADB  project \nadministration  and  management.  Improvements  were  made  after  the  audit,  including  the \nestablishment  of  separate  financial  records  for  the  Project.  Such  financial  records  will \nsubstantiate the actual cost of completing the Project in a potential arbitration with the original \ncontractor (para. 24). The EA has arranged for periodic external review of its records. The PMU \nwill have a considerably lighter workload than it had until the end of 2005, when it administered \nseveral contracts, including those for road rehabilitation and consulting services. The remaining \nworks  involve  only  two  contracts  and  one  force  account  section,  and  so  no  expansion  of  the \nPMU  staffing  is  required.  Contract  supervision  and  quality  control  will  be  carried  out  by \nexperienced consultants in contract management roles (as defined in the civil works contracts), \nsupported  by  a  technical  staff  (engineers,  surveyors,  materials  testing  technicians,  and  works \ninspectors) to be provided directly by the EA. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n2. \n \n37. \nAlthough  the  consulting  firm  that  designed  and  supervised  the  works  performed \nsatisfactorily, it will be replaced by suitably qualified and experienced individual consultants, and \na  supporting  technical  team  to  be  hired  directly  by  the  EA.  The  EA  considers  the  cost  of  the \nconsulting services so far (about F$11.5 million) to be excessive relative to the value of the work \nsupervised  and  is  seeking  greater  flexibility  to  defray  costs  if  the  rate  of  progress  is  not  as \nexpected.  International  and  national  consultants  will  be  hired  individually.  The  international \nconsultants  will  comprise  the  following:  a  project  manager,  to  serve  as  engineer  under  the \nconstruction  contracts  (26  person-months);  a  resident  engineer,  to  oversee  the  day-to-day \nsupervision  and  administration  of  the  contracts  (24  person-months);  a  materials  engineer,  to \ninspector \ncontrol \n(20 person-months).  National  consultants  (about  280  person-months)  will  support \nthe \ninternationally recruited personnel. Their terms of reference will be agreed on by ADB and the \nEA,  and  will  include  the  supervision  of  the  force  account  work,  as  recommended  in  the  audit \nreport.  Any  substantial  changes  in  the  supervision  arrangements  will  have  to  be  approved \nbeforehand  by  ADB.  The  EA  will  see  to  it  that  competent  and  experienced  consultants \nacceptable to ADB are employed to supervise the civil works at all times. \n\nthe  works  (22  person-months);  and  a  senior  works \n\nthe  quality  of \n\n                                                \n9  DNR  was  established  within  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Transport  as  the  first  stage  of  the  transition  to  an \n\nindependent road authority.

An \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n5. \n \n41. \nContinuity  of  the  physical  work  is  critical  to  completing  the  subproject  in  a  reasonable \nperiod of time. ADB financing for ongoing contracts will be used up in the fourth quarter of 2008. \nThe Government has asked ADB to approve advance action for the procurement of civil works. \nAdvance  action  covers  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  award.  The \nadvance  action  will  be  reviewed  for  conformity  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit \nADB to provide supplementary financing for the Project. \n \n42. \nThe Project will provide retroactive financing for civil works. Retroactive financing will be \npermitted  only  if  (i)  ADB  and  the  Borrower  specifically  agree  to  it  in  the  loan  agreement,  and \nonly  under  the  terms  of  the  relevant  agreement;  (ii)  the  works  for  which  it  is  requested  are \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines; and (iii) not more than 20% of the loan \namount  is  financed  retroactively.  The  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred  before  the  loan \nagreement takes effect, but no earlier than 12 months before the date the agreement is signed. \n \n43. \nThe  Government  has  informed  ADB  that  it  applied  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  in \nobtaining  bids  for  the  remaining  two  civil  works  contract  packages,  including  advertising  of \ntenders  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Procurement  followed  single-stage,  one-envelope  international \nbidding with post-qualification. The Government will submit its bid evaluation reports, including a \nfull  account  of  the  procurement  process,  to  ADB  for  review  before  any  contract  award.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n \n44. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  as  provided  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended from time  to  time).  Direct payment  procedures  will  be  used for \nthe civil works contracts. There will be no imprest account. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n7. \n \n45. \nDNR  will  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  reporting  progress  in  project \nimplementation. It will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports about preconstruction activities \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\finstitutional  development,  asset  management, \n\nand  construction  of  all  civil  works  including  physical  and  financial  progress,  status  of \nenvironmental  management, \nfinancial \nadministration  and  forward  budgeting,  institutional  capacity  building,  public  communications, \nand other activities relevant to project implementation. To facilitate performance monitoring and \npost-project  review,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB,  within  3  months  of  the  physical \ncompletion of the Project, a completion report covering project implementation details, costs and \nbenefits, and any other information that may be required by ADB. \n \nDNR will keep separate records and accounts for the Project identifying the goods and \n46. \nservices  financed  from  the  loan,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of \ncounterpart funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained according to sound \naccounting  principles  and  practices  based  on  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards. \nThe project accounts and annual financial statements will be subject to annual external audit by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use \nof the  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  the financial  covenants  in  the  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  ADB  with  the  annual  audited  financial  statements,  audited  project \naccounts,  audit  reports,  and  management  letters  and  other  related  statements  in  English,  no \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period. ADB \nwill issue a formal warning for accounts that are more than 6 months overdue and will suspend \ndisbursements for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n \n47. \nThe  Government  has  compiled  and  analyzed  base  data  to  facilitate  benefit  monitoring \nand evaluation of the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact. The monitoring and evaluation program \ncomprises three major activities: (i) benchmarking, to assist project planners and implementers \nin designing and implementing projects that respond to the needs of the intended beneficiaries, \nand to provide a basis for an objective assessment of the impact of the Project; (ii) monitoring \nduring implementation to ensure that the Project indeed benefits the intended beneficiaries; and \n(iii) evaluation  after  the  Project  to  assess  its  overall  effectiveness.  Such  monitoring  and \nevaluation  has  been  done  for  the  completed  subprojects  and  is  ongoing  for  the  Kings  and \nLodoni roads subproject. Measurement indicators under the original Project are in Appendix 6. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \n48. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt, fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating to the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also \ncomply  with  all  applicable  anticorruption  laws  of  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji  Islands.  A  project \nwebsite will be established and used to disclose the audited project financial accounts, project \nprogress, and procurement activities. \n \n \n \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProject Review \n\n10. \n \n49. \nADB and the Government will undertake semiannual and midterm reviews of the Project \nto assess (i) compliance with the loan covenants, (ii) physical achievements against milestones, \n(iii) loan disbursements and financial progress, and (iv) project implementation issues that need \nto  be  resolved  or  acted  on.  The  EA  will  review  the  estimates  of  the  subproject  costs  each \nquarter and reassess the project benefits if such costs increase by more than 10% of the base \ncosts. Assumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be periodically \nreviewed and corrective action taken if needed. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n50. \nThe  subproject  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  FRUP  Ill  and  supports  its  macroeconomic \nand  sector  objectives.  To  ensure  the  economic  viability  of  all  subprojects  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing,  the  minimum economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  set  at  12%.  The  benefits  of  road \nupgrading  will  accrue  primarily  from  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs.  Daily  traffic  on  each \nsubproject road was forecast in the feasibility documentation. From experience with earlier road \nupgrading  projects  in  Fiji  Islands,  traffic  on  upgraded  road  links  has  increased  beyond  the \nforecasts. Other benefits include lower transport costs both to suppliers and to users of goods \nand  services;  increased  agricultural  production  resulting  from  improved  access  to  rural \ncommunities and market centers; better access to health services, jobs, and schools; reduced \ndust;  and  increased  tourism.  Besides  the  benefits  from  road  use,  the  civil  works  under  the \nProject  have  generated  at  least  4,000\u20135,000  person-years  of  employment  for  skilled  and \nunskilled  labor.  The  partly  completed  roads  will  deteriorate  if  they  are  not  completed  or  if \ncompletion is deferred. The deterioration will result in increased maintenance costs and loss of \nbenefits from sunk costs. \n \n51. \nThe subproject was previously investigated under feasibility studies carried out for FRUP \nIII  in  1997\u20131998  under  preparatory  TA.  The  present  review  of  the  economic  analysis  uses \nmethods similar to those used in the FRUP III feasibility study, with updated traffic projections \nand  cost base.  But  instead of  the  Transport  Research Laboratory  Road  Transport  Investment \nModel  as  the  tool  of  analysis,  this  review  uses  the  World  Bank  Highway  Development  and \nManagement Model and updates the base case to take account of the work done in the interim. \nAlso, the present analysis is incremental, so it considers only those construction costs that are \nnot already sunk, and those benefits obtained from upgrading the road from its partly completed \nstate to its final design standard. \n \nEconomic  costs,  derived  from  financial  costs,  include  construction,  operation,  and \n52. \nmaintenance costs and exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, subsidies, and royalties.11 A \nstandard conversion factor of 0.986 was used to revalue goods and services at world prices into \nnational currency, and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.86 was applied to local unskilled labor. \nThese same factors were applied to capital and maintenance costs and the elements of vehicle \noperating and passenger time costs. For minor items where assessing the proportion of tax and \nduty within the financial costs was difficult, a conversion factor of 0.80 was applied. The project \nroads  are  expected  to  have  an  economic  life  of  20\u201325  years  before  major  pavement \nrehabilitation  is  needed,  with  resurfacing  at  intervals  throughout  this  period.  The  incremental \n\n                                                \n11 Royalties refer to payments to landowners for gravel and soil extracted from quarries and pits on their land. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\foperation and maintenance costs are the difference between the maintenance requirements for \nthe proposed upgraded bitumen-sealed roads and the maintenance requirements of the existing \ngravel-surface roads. \n \nTo estimate the benefits to road users, the differences between road user costs with and \n53. \nwithout  the  Project  were  compared.  Quantified  road  user  benefits  comprise  vehicle  operating \ncost and journey time savings, and reductions in traffic delay and associated vehicle operating \ncosts at one-lane bridges. Producer surplus benefits were included for agricultural development \nstimulated by the subproject within the direct area of influence of the road. Road user savings \nwere not included for agricultural freight traffic to avoid double-counting. The producer surplus \nbenefits were derived from detailed analysis from the original FRUP III feasibility study, updated \nto reflect changes in the cost base from 1997 to 2008. \n \n54. \nUnit  cost  data  for  vehicle  replacement,  tires,  fuel,  oil,  maintenance  labor,  and  crew \nwages came from road feasibility studies done in 2005 and 2007 for the Department of National \nRoads and ADB for the proposed FRUP IV. These studies included comprehensive surveys of \nvehicle operating cost inputs, market prices, taxes, and duties. Apart from fuel, vehicle running \ncosts were updated through the use of the \u201call groups\u201d and \u201ctransport group\u201d components of the \nconsumer  price  index  as  reported  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  Islands  and  the  Fiji  Islands \nBureau of Statistics. In the case of the transport group index, increases since 2007 are almost \nentirely  attributable  to  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel;  the  economic  cost  of  fuel  was  therefore \nreassessed through the use of current retail prices, without taking duties and taxes into account. \nFuel  costs  are  volatile,  but  the  present  level  is  judged  to  be  suitably  representative  of  the \nmedium-term outlook, and corresponds to a light crude oil price of around US$120 per barrel. \nFuel, a significant component of road user costs, has more than doubled in economic cost since \nthe original FRUP III feasibility study was prepared. \n \n55. \nSensitivity testing  was applied  to  the  EIRR  against  construction  cost,  base  traffic  level, \nand traffic growth rate, including or excluding producer surplus and economic multiplier benefits. \nThe  value  needed  to give an  EIRR of  12%  (the switching  value) and  the  sensitivity  index  (the \npercentage change in the variable divided by the percentage change in the net present value) \nwere  calculated  in  each  case.  Numerical  simulation  techniques  were  used  to  model  the \nprobability  that  the  EIRR  would  exceed  12%,  given  the  maximum,  most  likely,  and  minimum \nvalues of the main input parameters and assumed probability distributions. \n \n56. \nAs in the original analysis, no allowance was made for changes in accident costs. While \nthe  improved  alignment  and  road  surface  are  potential  safety  improvement  factors,  increased \ntraffic  speeds  may  lead  to  crash  injuries  that  could  be  more  severe,  depending  on  the \neffectiveness  of  traffic  management,  particularly  through  or  close  to  villages,  signage,  and \npolicing. A summary economic analysis for the subproject is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n1. \n\nKings Road \n\n57. \nKings Road is expected to yield benefits that other roads considered for the Project will \nnot offer. These are due to a reduction in length of almost 5 km, representing a distance saving \nof over 9% of the existing length, and benefits to diverted traffic. The benefits to diverted traffic \nwere  calculated  from  the  results  of  origin  and  destination  surveys  that  estimated  the  traffic \ndiverting to Kings Road from other routes, and from savings accruing from the reduced journey \nlength.  The  calculation  of  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  was  based  on  economic  costs  per \nkilometer, on the assumption that the journeys would be made on a good sealed road in both \nthe with- and the without-project cases. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTraffic growth in recent years on the Kings Road project section has been very variable, \n58. \naveraging 8% on  the first  link  between  Korovou and Waito,  but erratic on  the  other  links.  The \nprogressive  upgrading  of  adjacent  sections  of  the  road  has  influenced  traffic  growth  on  the \nproject links. The section north of Nayavu has been upgraded since 2004, and this has probably \ncontributed to strong growth between 2004 and 2008. More generally across the country, traffic \ngrowth  rates, averaged  over  175  of  DNR\u2019s  traffic  counts  between  2000  and  2004,  showed  an \nincrease  of 25%  (4.5%  per  year)  compared  with an  increase  of 14.6%  in  real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) (3.5% per year), for an implied factor of 1.72. \n \n59. \nThe  original  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  established  the  traffic  generation  effects  of \nupgrading  sections  of  Kings  Road  from  gravel  to  seal.  Traffic  increases  after  completion \nmeasured at  six  sites  were  observed  to vary from  28% to 92%,  with a general  relationship of \n50% growth for light traffic and 5% for heavy traffic for road lengths of over 10 km. The evidence \nis  still  valid  and  in  some  respects  may  be  a  conservative  estimate,  as  the  subproject  will \ncomplete the sealing of Kings Road. In particular, it is not possible to distinguish between heavy \nand light vehicles in generated traffic growth: both respond strongly to upgrading. A 50% growth \nrate for normal traffic after implementation was therefore used. \n \n60. \nThe estimated  traffic did not  allow for possible  increases  caused by an acceleration  of \ndevelopment  in  the  northeast  of  Fiji  Islands,  which  may  follow  the  upgrading  of  Kings  Road. \nAnother  source  of  additional  benefit  that  was  not  included  in  the  analysis  is  the  removal  of \nconstraints  on  traffic  caused  by  the  closure  of  the  road  in  the  rainy  season.  Bridgeworks, \nalready completed under the subproject, will prevent such closures. \n \nAn evaluation period of 25 years, covering the 2-year construction period and the design \n61. \nlife  of  the  road  before  major  rehabilitation,  was  used  in  the  analysis.  The  diverted  traffic  and \nproducer surplus benefits were estimated for the Kings Road link as a whole, and were added to \nthe benefits to normal and generated traffic calculated for each link through the use of the World \nBank\u2019s  Highway  Development  and  Management  (HDM)  model.12 The  incremental  analysis  to \nproject completion resulted in a present value of F$49.5 million for discounted costs and F$50.3 \nmillion for discounted benefits, and an EIRR of 12.2%. \n \nAn  analysis  of  risk  using  numerical  simulation  in which  the  main  sensitivity  parameters \n62. \nwere replaced with defined probability distributions was carried out. On this basis, there is 54% \nprobability that the EIRR for the subproject will exceed 12%, and 94% probability that the EIRR \nwill exceed 10%. \n \n63. \nThe  original  feasibility  study,  on  the  other  hand,  yielded  an  EIRR  of  15.7%,  and  a \npresent value of F$16.8 million for discounted costs and F$23.0 million for discounted benefits. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  completion  of  the  subproject  still  just  exceeds  12%  despite  the  greatly \nincreased  cost  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  base  traffic  has  grown  substantially  from  230 \nvehicles  per  day  in  1997  to  540  vehicles  per  day  in  2008,  averaged  over  the  length  of  the \nsubproject;  (ii)  the  traffic  that  can  be  diverted  has  also  grown;  (iii)  while  some  savings  in \ndistance reduction and single-lane bridge replacement have already been achieved, most of the \nuser  benefits  will  arise  from  the  pavement  construction  and  sealing,  which  is  yet  to  be \ncompleted;  and  (iv) while  construction  costs  have  increased,  so  too  have  the  unit  values  of \nproject  benefits.  A  post-evaluation  of  the  total  costs  and  benefits  of  the  subproject,  including \nsunk  costs  and  benefits  compared  against  the  pre-construction  condition,  is  likely  to  show  a \n\n                                                \n12 The software models pavement deterioration and corresponding changes in vehicle operating costs. \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\flower EIRR. However, it is the incremental costs and benefits to completion that are relevant to \nthe supplementary-funding decision. \n\nLodoni Road \n\n \n2. \n \n64. \nTraffic  volumes  on  Lodoni  Road  are  influenced  by  the  ferry  services  operating  from \nNatovi Jetty. When the FRUP III feasibility study was prepared, there were daily return services \nto Ovalau (Buresala) and Nabouwalu, and a single weekly service to Savusavu, all operated by \nPatterson Brothers Shipping. At that time, ferry services were estimated to contribute about 40 \nheavy trucks per day. Patterson Brothers continues to operate a daily service to Savusavu, and \nhas  had  disputes  with  other  operators  regarding  berth  occupancy  at  Natovi,  a  public  facility, \nindicating  that  there  will  be  continued  strong  demand  for  its  use  as  a  boarding  point  for \ninterisland  services.  The  completion  of  a  sealed  road  connection  is  likely  to  make  the  facility \neven  more  attractive.  Lodoni  Road  also  serves  two  major  educational  establishments,  the \nQueen Victoria School and the Ratu Kadalevu School, in addition to the entire population of the \neast coast of Viti Levu north of Korovou. \n \n65. \nTraffic  growth  over  2000\u20132004  on  Lodoni  Road  averaged  about  6.5%  (linear)  at  both \nDNR traffic count sites. However, a comparison against the 1995 counts indicates that this may \nbe  a  statistical  aberration. A normal  traffic growth  rate  of 3.5% over  the  medium  to  long term, \nsimilar to that adopted for Kings Road, was therefore used in the analysis. As with Kings Road, \nand following an analysis of previous projects in the area, generated traffic was assumed to be \n50%. \n \nA present value of F$12.5 million for discounted costs and F$15.6 million for discounted \n66. \nbenefits for the completion of the Lodoni Road upgrading, and incremental EIRR of 15.2%, was \nderived. The risk analysis shows 89% probability that the EIRR for the completion of the Project \nwill exceed 12%, and 99% probability that it will exceed 10%. \n \n67. \nIn comparison, the original feasibility study gave an EIRR of 14.8%, with a present value \nof  F$10.0  million  for  discounted  costs  and  F$12.4  million  for  discounted  benefits.  The \nincremental  EIRR  is  still  greater  than  12%  despite  the  increased  subproject  cost  for  reasons \nsimilar  to  those  for  Kings  Road,  although  in  this  case  there  is  no  diverted  traffic  and  a \nmuch-smaller reduction in road length. \n\n \n3. \n \n\nConfirmation of Economic Viability \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n68.  When  the  incremental  benefits and  costs of  completing each  road  are  compared,  both \nlinks remain economically viable, with an EIRR of 12.2% for Kings Road and 15.2% for Lodoni \nRoad. The combined EIRR for the entire Project is 12.8%. \n \nB. \n \n69. \nThe  original  contractor  for  the  Kings  and  Lodoni  roads  was  required  to  prepare  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the  construction  of  the  works.  In  addition, \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) and associated EMPs were required for all quarries \nor  borrow  pits  from  which  more  than  5,000  cubic  meters  of  soil,  gravel,  or  rock  were  to  be \nextracted.  These  EMPs  and  EIAs  were  prepared  and  approved  by  the  supervising  engineers \nand by the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, and the work has conformed to the subproject \nEMPs.  About  80%  of  the  site  has  been  worked  on,  with  earthworks  completed  within  the  site \nboundaries.  Existing  quarries  (those  for  which  EIAs  were  prepared  by  the  original  contractor) \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSocial Impact \n\nwill  be  used  to  complete  the  works;  no  new  borrow  pits  of  significance  are  expected.  In  fact, \nunused  borrow  pits  have  been  satisfactorily  reinstated,  as  was  noted  during  the  Fact-Finding \nMission. \n \nBidding documents for contract packages awarded for the completion of the subproject \n70. \nafter  the  termination  of  the  original  contract  require  the  contractors  to  adhere  to  approved \nEMPs. No significant or unanticipated environmental impact from construction has so far been \nexperienced. The supplementary loan is therefore classified as category C. \n \nC. \n \n71. \nA social impact study of the subproject (Supplementary Appendix A) confirmed that the \nsubproject  roads  serve  a  predominantly  rural  and  relatively  disadvantaged  segment  of  the \ncommunity. In 2002, the incidence of poverty was significantly higher in the area served directly \nby  the  roads  (76.4%  of  the  sample  group)  than  in  rural  areas  nationwide  (40%).13 That  same \nyear, the incidence of poverty (84%) was considerably higher among Fijians in the study area \n(84%)  than  among  Fijians  nationwide  (34%).  In  contrast,  the  incidence  of  poverty  was  less \namong  the  Indo-Fijian  sample  group  (22%)  than  among  Indo-Fijians  nationwide  (37%). \nFurthermore,  90%  of  the  Fijian  sample  group  had  household  incomes  in  2002  that  were  well \nbelow  the  national  average 14  for  rural  Fijian  households  ($11,082),  while  only  22%  of  the \nIndo-Fijian  sample  group  was  living  well  below  the  national  average  for  rural  Indo-Fijians \n($9,653).  The  subproject  will  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  and  produce  time  savings  (direct \nbenefits), and will also improve access to rural communities and to basic social facilities, as well \nas socioeconomic conditions in the areas served by the upgraded roads (indirect benefits). \n \nD. \n \n72. \nAll  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  actions  needed  for  the  subproject  have  been \ncompleted  satisfactorily  according  to  the  provisions  of  the  original  loan  agreement,  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy and procedures, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \nE. \n \n73. \nNo  gender  issues  or  specific  opportunities  for  gender  equality  are  associated  with  the \ncompletion  of  the  Kings  and  Lodoni  roads,  given  the  limited  focus  of  the  subproject  on  road \nconstruction.  But  the  Project  as  a  whole  will  have  pervasive  benefits:  all  segments  of  the \npopulation\u2014women, men, youth, and disadvantaged groups\u2014will gain from it. \n \nF. \n \nThe  disengagement of  the  consulting firm that  was  supervising  the  subproject brings a \n74. \nrisk that alternative arrangements will not be satisfactory, since the EA seems to have replaced \nthe consultant solely to save on costs. The quality of the work, in a difficult environment of poor \nsoils  and  high  rainfall,  requires a  comprehensive  system  of  inspection and  testing,  but  such a \nsystem  may  not hold up  if  those  responsible are  not  independent  of  the EA  and are  not  held \naccountable for failing to perform adequately. Kings Road in particular is in a high-rainfall area, \n\nResettlement Impact \n\nGender Impact \n\nRisks \n\n                                                \n13 Narsey, W. 2008.

Suva, Fiji. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fand poor climatic conditions during implementation could delay its completion. Hiring individual \nconsultants  who  are  professionally  and  academically  qualified,  and  have  considerable  and \nverifiable experience, can mitigate this risk. The risk should also be seen in light of the fact that \nkey  technical  challenges,  including  the  construction  of  16  bridges  and  the  establishment  of \nsuitable quarries and borrow pits, have already been surmounted and the remaining work is of \nmodest complexity, despite the difficult environment in which it is to be carried out. \n \n75. \nThe Government has been slow in arranging a variation to the contract for the provision \nof pavement materials. Base-course material must be washed to remove clay contaminants so \nthat it meets the specified quality; the potential need for such washing (at additional cost to the \nGovernment)  was  foreseen  in  the  contract.  Delays  in  resolving  this  issue  will  directly  affect \nsubsequent work, as the material is needed for the final pavement layer before the bituminous \nseal  can  be  applied.  This  is  an  immediate  requirement  in  one  of  the  contracts  still  to  be \nprocured. Deferring the award of this contract until there is enough supply of base course may \nmitigate  this  risk.  However,  deferment  will  also  increase  the  risk  of  damage  to  the  underlying \npavement layers that have already been constructed. The EA has advised that the bids received \nso  far  are  either  heavily  qualified  (to  the  extent  of  being  unresponsive)  or  submitted  by \nunqualified  bidders.  The  earliest  at  which  this  contract  can  be  awarded,  after  new  bids  are \ninvited, is April 2009, giving the EA more time to resolve the issue of base-course supply. Base \ncourse will not be needed for the second contract until August 2009, if the contract is awarded \nby January 2009. The issue preventing agreement is financial rather than technical. Risks lie in \nthe  possibility  that  negotiations  will  continue  to  be  protracted.  An  agreement  for  mediation  or \narbitration on the cost of the additional work would allow it to begin immediately, with costs to be \ndetermined on the basis of actual costs. \n \n76. \nTwo ICB contracts still have to be awarded, and the cost of all work, including the force \naccount work, is very sensitive to the price of fuel in particular. The cost estimates are based on \nbid prices  received  in  mid-2008,  and  these  were in  turn  based on  high fuel  costs,  which  have \nsince moderated significantly. Actual fuel costs will be reflected in the final contract price of one \nof the ICB contracts (if awarded under the current bid process) through its contractual provisions \nfor price adjustment. The other ICB contract has no price adjustment provision because it is of \nrelatively  short  duration  (13  months).  The  latter  contract  may  be  rebid  with  price  adjustment \nprovisions.  The  former  contract  may  also  be  rebid  to  ensure  that  the  bid  prices  adequately \nreflect  the  significant  economic  changes  that  have  occurred  worldwide  since  July  2008 \n(including currency realignments and a significant fall in the price of oil). \n \nThe timely completion of the subproject depends on the careful selection of appropriately \n77. \nexperienced and competent contractors to do the work. The original contractor failed to provide \nadequate skilled supervisory personnel or sufficient equipment for the work, with due regard to \nthe  production  rates  required  and  the  limitations  imposed  by  the  generally  wet  climatic \nconditions  in  the  area.  A  thorough  review  of  the  bidders\u2019  experience  in  similar  work,  and  the \namount, age, and condition of the equipment that is proposed for the work, should therefore be \npart  of  the  bid  evaluation.  The  EA  should  require  a  firm  undertaking  from  the  recommended \ncontractor that it will mobilize at least the promised level of resources. \n \n78. \nThe completion of the subproject is subject to technical risks that are largely within the \ncontrol of the EA. These risks can be satisfactorily mitigated through sound project management \nand supervision. \n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n79. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nCounterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required \ncounterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner in order \nto ensure the proper implementation of the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\nCost  recovery  under  the  original  civil  works  contract.  In  the event  that  the \nGovernment is successful, in whole or in part, in recovering the cost overrun from \nthe original  contractor,  then  such  sums  will  be applied  to  the  extent necessary,  \nto  priority  road  rehabilitation  as defined by  the  road asset  management  system \nand to ensure adequate funding of road maintenance. \n\nProject  management. The Government will ensure that the PMU is adequately \nstaffed and resourced, including a qualified financial officer and an experienced \nproject management engineer, exclusively for the Project. DNR shall recruit and \nretain,  during  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  consultants  with  competence \nand  experience  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  construction  supervision,  including \nsupervision  of  the  force  account  work.  The  terms  of  reference  of  such \nconsultants will be determined by agreement between ADB and DNR. \n\nConstruction  quality.  DNR  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  built  in  accordance \nwith the technical design specifications and that construction supervision, quality \nin  accordance  with \ncontrol,  and  contract  management  are \ninternationally accepted standards. \n\nimplemented \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that any land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement required for the Project will be managed in \naccordance  with  applicable  government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\nEnvironmental  management.  DNR  will  (a)  design,  construct,  operate,  and \nmaintain the roads in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in the \nFiji Islands and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (b) ensure that EMPs for the \nremaining  civil  works  contract  packages  (except  civil  works  contract  packages \nthe  bidding  documents  for  which  have  been  issued  by  DNR  and  approved  by \nADB  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement)  and  works  procured  by \nforce  account  are  updated  and  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  the  bidding  of  those \ncivil works contract packages or the commencement of works procured by force \naccount,  as  the  case  may  be;  (c)  incorporate  all  environmental  mitigation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  measures  specified  in  the  updated  EMPs  in  the \nrelevant bidding documents and civil works contract specifications; and (d) report \nto ADB any unanticipated negative environmental impact, and take proper action \nto mitigate the impact. \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f(vii) \n\nEnvironmental  monitoring  and  reporting.  DNR  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  force \naccount  works and  civil  works contractors are  monitored  closely  to  comply  with \nall environmental impact mitigation, monitoring, and consultation requirements in \nthe EMPs; and (b) prepare and submit to ADB a consolidated quarterly report for \nall EMPs being implemented during the project implementation. \n\n(viii)  Labor standards. DNR will ensure that provisions are stipulated in all civil works \ncontracts  to  require  contractors  employed  under  the  Project  to  incorporate \nminimum  workplace  occupational  safety  norms,  including  the  core  labor \nstandards  as  identified  in  the  fundamental  International  Labour  Organization \nconventions.  DNR  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  any  aspect  of  their \nactivities.  DNR  will  ensure  that  contractors  provide  appropriate  training,  and \ninformation  materials  for  workers  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and  that  contractors \nand their workers observe local protocols concerning acceptable behavior toward \nthe  local  population.  DNR  will  require  contractors  not  to  differentiate  wages \nbetween men and women for work of equal value. All civil works contracts to be \nfinanced  under  the  ADB  loan  will  include  specific  clauses  to  this  effect,  and \ncompliance shall be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n\n(ix) \n\nGovernance  and  anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the \nProject  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  anticorruption  laws  and \nregulations in the Fiji Islands and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date); and (b) a project website is developed within 2 months of effectiveness \nof  the  loan  agreement,  and  maintained  to  disclose  the  audited  project  financial \naccounts, project progress, and procurement activities. \n\n \nCondition for Disbursement \n\nB. \n \n80. \nNo  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  works  will  take  place  until  DNR  will  have \nrecruited  consultants  with  competence  and  experience  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  construction \nsupervision,  including  supervision  of  the  works  procured  by  force  account.  The  following \nfull-time  positions  will  be  occupied  by  the  consultants:  a  supervising  engineer,  a  resident \nengineer, a materials engineer, and a senior works inspector. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n81. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  supplementary \nloan of US$36,100,000 to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Third Road Upgrading (Sector) \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  20  years, \nincluding a grace period of 2 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n24 February 2009 \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n21 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEconomic and social \ndevelopment; hardship \nand poverty reduction  \n\nOutcome \nImproved access to \nservices and markets  \n\nAssumption \nCountry economic conditions \nare conducive to uptake of \nimproved economic \nopportunities \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumption \nNew contracts are \nimplemented on time \n \n \n \n\n \nIncidence of \nhouseholds in the \nsubproject catchment \narea beneath the Fiji \nbasic needs poverty \nline (US$150 per week) \nreduced from 76% to \nless than 60% by June \n2012 \n \n \n13,000 people resident \nin the catchment area \nwith direct access to \nsealed roads by \nOctober 2011 \n \nReduced travel times \non Kings and Lodoni \nroads (average vehicle \noperating speeds \nincreased from 30 km \nper hour to 50 km per \nhour by October 2011) \n \nReduction in vehicle \noperating cost through \nreduction in average \ninternational road \nroughness index from \ngreater than 10 mm/km \nto less than 4 mm/km \nby October 2011  \n \nIncrease in daily traffic \n(baseline values in \n2008 surveys to review \nsubproject viability) by \nan average annual \ncompound rate of 3.5% \n \nRoad safety \nimprovements \n \n \nUpgrading  of  50  km  of \nroad by October 2011 \n \n\n \nHousehold income and \nexpenditure survey (HIES) \n2002/03 and future \nreports, rural \nunemployment data \n \n \n\n \nDemographic surveys \n(Bureau of Statistics) \n \n \n \n \nSavings in transport costs \n(BME) \n \nTraffic counts by \nDepartment of National \nRoads (DNR) \n \n \nRoad roughness \nmeasurements (DNR) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChange in number of road \naccidents and in causes of \naccidents (BME) \n(analysis of police traffic \naccident data unit road \naccident records and \nreports) \n\n \nReview missions \nEA reports and surveys \n \n\nOutputs  \n1.

For  the  Lodoni  and  Kings  Road  upgrading  subproject,  the  without-project \n1. \nbase  case  against  which  changes  in  road  provider  and  road  user  costs  are  compared  is  the \npartially  upgraded  gravel-standard  road  on  a  constrained  alignment.  The  with-project  case \ninvolves  carriageway  widening,  double  surface-treated  bitumen  chip-seal  pavement,  minor \nhorizontal  realignment  with  some  length  reduction,  improvements  in  the  vertical  profile,  and \nreplacement of single-lane bridges in poor structural condition with two-lane bridges. \n \n2. \nPrevious  Investigation.  The  subproject  was  previously  investigated  under  feasibility \nstudies  carried  out  for  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project  (FRUP  III)  in  1997\u20131998  as \npreparatory  technical  assistance.1 These  studies  should  be  referred  to  for  details  of  the  prior \neconomic  analysis.  The  Kings  Road  section  (Korovou\u2013Dama)  was  originally  investigated  in \n1995 as  a  possible subproject for  the earlier  FRUP  II,  but  the  matter  was not pursued  at  that \ntime. \n \n3. \nThe  prior  economic  analysis  estimated  discounted  economic  costs,  benefits,  and \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), as shown in Table A7.1 below. Vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings were evaluated in the usual way for normal, generated, and, in the case \nof Kings Road, diverted traffic. For agricultural freight traffic, a producer surplus approach was \nused for Kings Road, in view of the Subproject\u2019s function in enabling cash crop production from \nthe hinterland served. The cash cropping of perishable market produce, sensitive to time delay \nand  road  roughness,  is  now  constrained  by  lack  of  reliable  all-weather  access.  The  price \nstructure, supply elasticities, and potential production volumes were estimated through the use \nof  Ministry  of  Agriculture  data  for  fruit  and  vegetable  crops,  but  excluding  the  area  already \nearmarked for a government development project. \n \n\nTable A7.1: Prior Economic Assessment  \n(US$) \n \n\nKings Road \n\nLodoni Road \n\nTotal \n\nItem \nDiscounted Costs \n  Construction \n  Maintenance Savings \n \nDiscounted Benefits \n  Vehicle Operating Cost Savings \n \n  Single-Lane Bridge Delay \nSavings \n  Agricultural Producer Surplus  \n \nTotal \n  EIRR \n\nTime Savings \n\n \n\n18.99 \n(2.16) \n16.83  \n \n15.69 \n4.23 \n0.14 \n\n2.92 \n22.98 \n15.7% \n\n \n11.33 \n(1.28) \n10.05 \n \n10.60 \n5.53 \n0.36 \n\n\u2014 \n16.49 \n14.8% \n\n\u2014 = not available, ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, - = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji  Islands  for  the  Third  Road  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n31 \n\nCurrent Review. This review of the economic analysis uses methodology similar to that \n4. \nused  in  the  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  but  with  updated  traffic  projections  and  cost  base. \nDifferences lie in the use of the World Bank Highway Development and Management (HDM) in \nplace of  the  Transport  Research  Laboratory  Road  Transport  Investment  Model  (RTIM)  as  the \nanalysis tool, and the updating of the base case to take account of the work already done in the \ninterim  on  the  first  section  of  Kings  Road.  The  analysis  is  made  on  an  incremental  basis, \ncomparing  the  economic  benefits  yet  to be obtained  by  completing  the  subproject  against the \nincremental  costs  to  completion  of  construction.  Costs  already  expended  in  the  partial \nconstruction  to  date  are  regarded  as  sunk,  and  so  are  not  included  in  the  analysis.  Similarly, \nbenefits already obtained, such as through route shortening on the first section of Kings Road \nand completion of several single-lane bridges, are excluded from the analysis. \n \nCosts.  Economic  costs  were  derived  from  financial  costs  and  include  the  cost  of \n5. \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  Price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  subsidies,  and \nroyalties  are  excluded.  As  with  other  recent  ADB  projects  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  a  standard \nconversion factor of 0.986 was used to revalue goods and services at world prices into national \ncurrency  and  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.86  was  applied  to  local  unskilled  labor.  These \nsame  factors  were  applied  to  capital  and  maintenance  costs  and  the  elements  of  vehicle \noperating  and  passenger  time  costs.  A  conversion  factor  of  0.80  was  applied  to  minor  items \nwhere  assessing  the  proportion  of  tax  and  duty  within  the  financial  costs  was  difficult.  The \nproject  roads  are  expected  to  have  an  economic  life  of  20\u201325  years  before  major  pavement \nrehabilitation,  with  resurfacing  applied  at  intervals  throughout  this  period.  The  incremental \noperation and maintenance costs are the difference between the maintenance requirements for \nthe proposed upgraded bitumen-sealed roads and the maintenance requirements of the existing \ngravel-surface roads. \n \n6. \nBenefits.  The  benefits  to  road  users  were  estimated  by  comparing  the  differences \nbetween road user costs for the with- and without-project cases. Quantified road user benefits \ncomprise  vehicle  operating  cost  and  journey  time  savings,  and  reductions  in  traffic  delay  and \nassociated  vehicle  operating  costs  at  one-lane  bridges.  Producer  surplus  benefits  have  been \nincluded  for  agricultural  development  stimulated  by  the  subproject  within  the  direct  area  of \ninfluence of the road. Road user savings have not been included for agricultural freight traffic to \navoid  double-counting.  The producer  surplus  benefits are  based on detailed analysis from  the \noriginal FRUP III feasibility study, updated to reflect changes in the cost base between 1997 and \n2008. \n \nModeling.  The  HDM  model  was  used  to  compare  the  annual  streams  of  economic \n7. \ncapital and operating costs and benefits and derived net present values (NPVs) and EIRR. All \ncosts  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  2008  constant  prices.  The  analysis  period  was  25  years \nfrom 2009 to 2033, extending over a 2-year construction program and the economic life of the \nupgraded  road  links  before  major  rehabilitation.  Diverted  traffic  benefits  and  producer  surplus \nbenefits were estimated exogenously to the HDM model. \n \n8. \nSensitivity  and  Risk.  Sensitivity  testing  was  applied  to  the  EIRR  against  a  20% \nincrease  in  construction  cost,  a  20%  decrease  in  base  traffic  level,  a  one-percentage-point \nreduction  in  normal  traffic  growth  rate,  a  crude  oil  price  reduction  of  25%,  the  exclusion  of \nproducer surplus benefits, and a project completion delay of 1 year. The value needed to give \nan  EIRR  of 12%  (the  switching  value)  and  the  sensitivity  index  (the  percentage  change  in  the \nvariable divided by the percentage change in the NPV) were calculated in each case. Numerical \nsimulation techniques were used to model the probability that the EIRR would exceed 12% and \n\n \n\n\f \n32 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nB. \n\nRoad User Costs \n\n10%, given the  maximum,  most  likely,  and  minimum  values of  the  main  input parameters  and \nassumed probability distributions. \n\n9. \nUnit  cost  data  for  vehicle  replacement,  tires,  fuel,  oil,  maintenance  labor,  and  crew \nwages  have  been  derived  from  road  feasibility  studies  carried  out  in  2005  and  2007  for  the \nDepartment  of  National  Roads  (DNR)  and  ADB  for  the  proposed  FRUP  IV.  These  studies \nincluded  comprehensive  surveys  of  vehicle  operating  cost  inputs,  market  prices,  taxes,  and \nduties.  Apart  from  fuel,  vehicle  running  costs  have  been  updated  using  the  \u201call  groups\u201d  and \n\u201ctransport group\u201d components of the consumer price index as reported by the Reserve Bank of \nFiji and the Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics. In the case of the transport group index, increases \nsince 2007 are almost entirely attributable to gasoline and diesel fuel, and the economic cost of \nfuel has therefore been reassessed using current retail prices and removing duties and taxes. \nFuel  costs  are  volatile,  but  the  present  level  is  judged  to  be  suitably  representative  of  the \nmedium-term  outlook,  and  corresponds  to  a  light  crude  oil  price  in  the  region  of  US$120  per \nbarrel. Fuel forms a significant component of road user costs and its economic cost has more \nthan doubled since the original FRUP III feasibility study was prepared. \n \nValues  for  work  travel  time,  crew  wages,  and  maintenance  labor  are  based  on  2007 \n10. \nsurveyed values used in prior feasibility studies carried out for the DNR. Although wage growth \nexpectations  as  reported  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji,  average  3%  per  year,  in  the  present \neconomic climate no increment from 2007 has been assumed. \n \n11. \nAs  with  the  original  analysis,  no  allowance  has  been  made  for  changes  in  accident \ncosts. While the improved alignment and road surface are potential safety improvement factors, \nincreased  traffic  speeds  may  lead  to  more  severe  crash  injuries.  The outcome  will  depend on \nthe  effectiveness  of  traffic  management,  particularly  through or  close  to  villages,  signage, and \npolicing. \n\nC. \n\nKings Road, Korovou\u2013Nayavu \n\n1. \n\nRoad Links for Analysis \n\n12. \nThe study section of Kings Road begins at the roundabout immediately north of Korovou \nat the junction with Lodoni Road, identified as Road 23000, kilometer (km) 10.108, in the DNR\u2019s \nasset  management  inventory.  It ends  at  the  DNR  depot  in  Nayavu,  identified as  km  32.864  in \nthe inventory (note: inventory kilometer points may not correspond to actual distances because \nconstruction  changes  route  length  over  time).  The  road  has  been  divided  into  three  links  for \nanalysis in relation to changes in traffic level, road alignment, and terrain: (i) the first 9.2 km to \nWaito,  which  is  mainly  level  to  rolling  terrain  through  agricultural  land  used  for  dairy  farming; \n(ii) a mountainous 11.4 km section, where the road rises over a range of hills before descending \nto the Wainibuka Valley, the end of the  section being at Waioluta,  the  junction  with Vunidawa \nRoad;  and  (iii)  the  remaining  11.2  km,  which  follows  the  east  bank  of  the  Wainibuka  River \nthrough numerous villages, some of which are bypassed by the new road alignment. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n33 \n\n2. \n\nRoad Geometry and Condition \n\n13. \nThe  existing  road  geometry,  averaged  over  each  link,  is  shown  in  Table  A7.2  for  the \nexisting road condition and for the proposed upgrading.

Traffic growth over recent years on the Kings Road subproject section \nhas been very variable, averaging 8% on the first link between Korovou and Waito, but erratic \non  the  remaining  links.  Progressive  upgrading  of  adjacent  sections  of  Kings  Road  has \ninfluenced  traffic growth on  the project  links.  The  section north of  Nayavu has  been upgraded \nsince  2004,  and  is  credited  with  the  strong  growth  between  2004  and  2008.  More  generally \nacross  the  country,  traffic  growth  rates,  averaged  over  175  of  DNR\u2019s  traffic  counts  between \n2000 and 2004, showed an increase of 25% (4.5% yearly), compared with an increase of 14.6% \nin real gross domestic product (GDP) (3.5% yearly), an implied factor of 1.72. Over the longer \nterm from 1992, traffic growth on interurban routes has averaged around 4.0%\u20134.5% per year. \nWhile  GDP has  been flat  since  2005, the  Reserve  Bank of  Fiji  expects an upward path  to  be \nregained by 2010. Historic performance indicates linear rather than compound growth, and the \nmedium- to long-term growth in GDP is estimated to be 2%, and interurban normal traffic growth \n3.5%  (linear).  The  HDM  model  requires  the  use  of  compound  growth  rates,  which  can  be \napproximated by providing for 3.5% growth to 2018 and 3% thereafter. \n \n19. \nGenerated  Traffic.  The  original  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  established  the  traffic \ngeneration  effects  of  upgrading  sections  of  Kings  Road  from  gravel  to  seal.  Traffic  increases \nafter  completion  measured  at  six  sites  varied from  28% to  92%,  with a general  relationship of \n50% growth for light traffic and 5% for heavy traffic for road lengths over 10 km. The evidence is \nstill valid and in some respects may be a conservative estimate, as the Subproject will provide \nthe  missing  link  to  complete  the  sealing  of  Kings  Road.  In  particular,  it  is  not  possible  to \ndistinguish between heavy and light vehicles in generated traffic growth: both respond strongly \nto  upgrading.  A 50%  rate  of growth  in  normal  traffic  levels  after  implementation has  therefore \nbeen  used.  Agricultural  development  traffic,  the  economic  benefits  of  which  are  evaluated \nthrough the producer surplus approach, is additional to this generated traffic.  \n \nDiverted  Traffic.  Traffic  levels  on  Kings  Road,  measured  at  Vunidawa  Junction,  have \n20. \nvaried  between  100  vpd  and  200  vpd  as  far  back  as  the  1970s.  Traffic  has  increased  and \ndecreased  in  response  to  economic  conditions and  to the  comparative attractiveness of  Kings \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n35 \n\nRoad  and  Queens  Road  as  possible  alternative  routes  for  longer-distance  traffic.  As  Queens \nRoad was upgraded in the 1980s, historic traffic counts suggest that some 60\u201380 vpd diverted \naway from Kings Road. This indicates the potential, once Kings Road is upgraded to a sealed \nstandard over its full length, for a diversion of traffic back to Kings Road for those trips, mainly \nwith one end in Suva, and destination in the north and northeast of Viti Levu. \n \n21. \nThe attraction back to Kings Road will come from reduced travel times, distance savings \non the upgraded road, lower vehicle operating costs, and the inherent attractiveness of a sealed \nroute  over  a  gravel  road  particularly  for  light  traffic,  because  of  higher  trip  reliability  and  the \nabsence  of  loose  gravel  and  dust,  which  are  known  drawbacks  for  road  users,  even  if  not \nroutinely quantified in monetary benefits. Indeed, sealing the last section, which the subproject \nwill  achieve,  is  likely  to  give  a  once-off  increase  in  traffic  specifically  by  making  the  route \nacceptable  for  two-wheel  drive  vehicles.  The  original  FRUP  III  feasibility  study  noted  that  the \npoint of equidistance from Suva lies midway between Ba and Lautoka, but that Suva\u2013Ba traffic \ncurrently  uses  Queens  Road,  even  with  a  20  km  distance  penalty.  The  traffic  that  can  be \ndiverted  was  estimated  to  be  82  vpd  in  1995,  based  on  traffic  counts,  and  120  vpd  in  2008, \ntaking into account growth in the intervening period. \n\n5. \n\nEIRR and Sensitivity \n\nThe discounted cash flow, net present value of benefits less costs and economic internal \n22. \nrate of return (EIRR) are shown in Table A7.6. An evaluation period of 25 years has been used, \ncovering a 2-year construction period and the design life of the road before major rehabilitation. \nThe diverted traffic and producer surplus benefits are estimated for the subproject as a whole, \nand are  added  to  the  benefits  to  normal and  generated  traffic  calculated  on  a  link basis  using \nthe HDM model. The EIRR is calculated to be 12.2%. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n6\n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTable A7.6: Economic Discounted Cash Flow for the Kings Road Subproject  \n(F$ million, 2008) \n\n \n\nYear \n\nConstruction\nCosts \n\nMaintenance\nCosts \n\nVOC Savings, \nby Traffic Type \n\nTravel Time Savings, \nby Traffic Type \n\nNormal  Generated  Diverted \n\nNormal  Generated  Diverted \n\nSingle-Lane \nBridge \nRemoval \nBenefits \n\nProducer \nSurplus \nBenefits \n\nNet Benefits/ \n(Costs) \n\nUndiscounted Costs and Benefits \n(29.01)  \n0.00  \n2009 \n(29.01 ) \n0.00  \n2010 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2011 \n0.04  \n0.04  \n2012 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2013 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2014 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2015 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2016 \n0.04  \n0.05  \n2017 \n(1.38)  \n0.01  \n2018 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2019 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2020 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2021 \n0.04  \n0.05  \n2022 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2023 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2024 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2025 \n(1.38)  \n0.01  \n2026 \n0.04  \n0.05  \n2027 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2028 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2029 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2030 \n0.00  \n0.01  \n2031 \n0.04  \n0.06  \n2032 \n2033 \n0.01  \n0.00  \nDiscounted Costs and Benefits \nTotal \nEIRR \n\n(49.60)  \n12.2% \n\n0.09  \n\n0.00  \n0.08  \n2.60  \n2.63  \n2.04  \n2.64  \n2.96  \n3.07  \n3.18  \n2.51  \n3.20  \n3.51  \n3.62  \n3.73  \n2.98  \n3.80  \n4.10  \n4.21  \n4.32  \n3.52  \n4.47  \n4.75  \n4.88  \n5.02  \n4.16  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.79  \n0.79  \n0.79  \n0.79  \n0.79  \n0.79  \n0.80  \n0.80  \n0.80  \n0.80  \n0.80  \n0.81  \n0.81  \n0.81  \n0.81  \n0.82  \n0.82  \n0.82  \n0.82  \n0.83  \n0.83  \n0.83  \n0.83  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n1.24  \n1.28  \n1.33  \n1.37  \n1.42  \n1.47  \n1.52  \n1.58  \n1.63  \n1.68  \n1.73  \n1.78  \n1.84  \n1.89  \n1.95  \n2.01  \n2.07  \n2.13  \n2.19  \n2.26  \n2.33  \n2.40  \n2.47  \n\n9.61  \n\n0.00  \n0.04  \n0.86  \n0.87  \n0.65  \n0.85  \n0.98  \n1.02  \n1.07  \n0.81  \n1.06  \n1.19  \n1.23  \n1.27  \n0.98  \n1.27  \n1.40  \n1.44  \n1.49  \n1.18  \n1.52  \n1.64  \n1.69  \n1.74  \n1.40  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.25  \n0.26  \n0.27  \n0.27  \n0.28  \n0.29  \n0.30  \n0.32  \n0.33  \n0.34  \n0.35  \n0.36  \n0.37  \n0.38  \n0.39  \n0.40  \n0.41  \n0.43  \n0.44  \n0.45  \n0.47  \n0.48  \n0.49  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.06  \n0.06  \n0.06  \n0.07  \n0.07  \n0.07  \n0.07  \n0.07  \n0.08  \n0.08  \n0.08  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.10  \n0.10  \n0.11  \n0.11  \n0.11  \n0.12  \n0.12  \n0.13  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.97  \n1.01  \n1.04  \n1.08  \n1.11  \n1.15  \n1.19  \n1.24  \n1.28  \n1.32  \n1.36  \n1.40  \n1.44  \n1.48  \n1.53  \n1.57  \n1.62  \n1.67  \n1.72  \n1.77  \n1.82  \n1.88  \n1.93  \n\n \n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18.88  \n\n4.91  \n\n6.28  \n\n0.71  \n\n1.92  \n\n0.46  \n\n7.54  \n\n0.90  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(29.01)  \n(29.01)  \n6.88  \n7.09  \n6.29  \n7.19  \n7.74  \n7.99  \n8.34  \n6.05  \n8.49  \n9.04  \n9.28  \n9.64  \n8.62  \n9.85  \n10.39  \n9.29  \n11.04  \n9.97  \n11.40  \n11.94  \n12.25  \n12.68  \n11.54  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n \n\n37 \n\nEIRR  sensitivity  has  been  estimated  with  respect  to  changes  in  the  values of  some  of \n23. \nthe major inputs. The switching values (the change needed in the variable to give an EIRR of \n12%)  and  sensitivity  indexes  (the  percentage  change  in  the  EIRR  divided  by  the  percentage \nchange  in  the  variable) are  shown  in  Table A7.7.  Smaller  values  of  the sensitivity  index  imply \nless sensitivity to the variable. In view of the current volatility in the price of crude oil and refined \nproducts, a sensitivity test has been included for a reduction of 25% in the crude oil price, from \nUS$120  to  US$90,  corresponding  to  a  22%  and  23%  fall  in  the  economic  cost  of  diesel  and \npetrol.  This  has  an  effect  both  on  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  and  on  construction  costs, \nalthough for vehicle operating cost savings, the change in fuel price reduces both the with- and \nthe without-project cost stream, so the net effect is relatively small. The fuel cost component of \nconstruction  is  estimated  to  be  20%  of  total  costs,  so  a  22%  reduction  in  diesel  input  prices \nreduces construction costs by 4.4%, assuming a competitive construction market. The net effect \nis almost neutral, a small increase in the EIRR from 12.2% to 12.5%. \n \n\nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Tests \n\nScenario \nBase Case \nSensitivity Parameters \n1. Capital costs  \n2.

The project section ends at km 21.33 \nat Queen Victoria School, a large secondary school about 3.7 km beyond the turnoff to Natovi \n(at km 17.69). Lodoni Road continues for a further 22 km beyond the school, providing access \nto coastal settlements. The road provides access to the interisland ferry terminal at Natovi Jetty \nat  km  17.69,  which  supports  roll-on,  roll-off  freight  and  passenger  services  to  Nabouwalu  on \nVanua Levu and Buresala on Ovalau. \n \n26. \nThe project section has been broken into three links for the HDM analysis, according to \nterrain and upgrading standard. The first link to km 7 includes a 2.7 km hilly section and carries \na traffic volume approximately double that measured at Natovi Jetty. The second link is mainly \nlevel  to  rolling  terrain.  Seven  single-lane  bridges  with  spans  of 12\u201326  meters  will  be  replaced \nwith new two-lane structures. \n\n2. \n\nRoad Geometry and Condition \n\nThe  existing  road  geometry,  averaged  over  each  link  is  shown  in  Table  A7.9  for  the \n\n27. \nexisting road condition and for the proposed upgrading. \n \n\nTable A7.9: Road Alignment and Cross Section, Existing and Upgraded, of Lodoni Road \n\nLink \nExisting \nKorovou to km 7 \nkm 7 to Natovi Jnc \nNatovi Jnc to QVS \n \nUpgraded \nKorovou to km 7 \nkm 7 to Natovi Jnc \nNatovi Jnc to QVS \n\nLength \n(km) \n \n7.0 \n10.6 \n3.7 \n \n \n6.9 \n10.4 \n3.6 \n\nRise and \nFall \n(m/km) \n \n30 \n20 \n20 \n \n \n30 \n20 \n20 \n\nCurvature \n(degrees/ \nkm) \n \n200 \n100 \n100 \n \n \n200 \n100 \n100 \n\nCarriage-\nWay Width \n(m) \n \n7.0 \n7.0 \n7.0 \n \n \n7.3 \n7.3 \n7.3 \n\nShoulder \nWidth \n(m) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 x 1.5 \n2 x 1.5 \n2 x 1.5 \n\nRainfall \n(mm/y) \n \n3,500 \n \n \n \n \n3,500 \n \n \n\nDesign \nSpeed \n(km/h) \n \n60 \n70 \n70 \n \n \n70 \n80 \n80 \n\nJnc  =  junction,  km  =  kilometer,  km/h  =  kilometers  per  hour,  m  =  meter,  mm/y  =  millimeters  per  year,  QVS  =  Queen \nVictoria School. \nSource: Department of National Roads inventory and surveys, August 2008. \n\n \nExisting  road  conditions  are  as  recorded  in  the  DNR  road  asset  inventory  and  as \n28. \ndetermined by visual inspection and roughness surveys carried out for this analysis, as shown \nbelow.

When the FRUP III feasibility study was prepared, there were daily return services \nto  Ovalau  (Buresala)  and  to  Nabouwalu,  and  a  single  service  per  week  to  Savusavu,  all \noperated  by  Patterson  Brothers  Shipping.  At  that  time,  ferry  services  were  estimated  to \ncontribute about 40 heavy trucks per day. Patterson Brothers continues to operate from Natovi, \nrunning  a  daily  service  to  Savusavu,  and  there  have  been  disputes  with  other  operators \nregarding  berth  occupancy  at  Natovi,  which  is  a  public  facility,  indicating  that  there  will  be \ncontinued strong demand for its use as a boarding point for interisland services. Completion of a \nsealed road connection is likely to enhance its attractiveness. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n4. \n\nTraffic Growth and Projections \n\n32. \nTraffic  is  considered  in  the three  categories  of  normal  traffic  growth  (traffic  growth that \nwould  occur  irrespective of  the Project), generated traffic  (new  traffic developed as a  result  of \nincreased activity attributable to the Project, and diverted traffic (rerouting of traffic induced by \nthe Project). \n \n33. \nNormal  Traffic.  Traffic  growth  over  2000\u20132004 on Lodoni  Road  averaged  about 6.5% \n(linear)  at  both  DNR  traffic  count  sites.  However,  a  comparison  against  the  1995  counts \nindicates  that  this  may  be  a  statistical  aberration,  and  a  medium-  to  long-term  growth  rate  of \n3.5% similar to that for used for Kings Road should be adopted as the normal traffic growth rate. \nThe  HDM  model  requires  the  use  of  compound  growth  rates,  which  can  be  approximated  by \nproviding for 3.5% growth to 2018 and 3% thereafter. \n \n34. \nGenerated Traffic. A general relationship of 50% generated traffic has been established \nfrom other road upgrading works on Kings Road and other similar situations. This percentage is \napplied to the level of normal traffic at the end of the construction period. \n \n35. \nDiverted  Traffic.  There  is  a  possibility  of  some  minor  traffic  diversion  from  other \ninterisland  ferry  routes  as  a  result  of  the  Lodoni  Road  upgrade.  However,  this  was  not \nconsidered in the original FRUP III feasibility study. The extent of the diversion is probably small \nand  dependent  on  ferry  operator  response,  and  so  has  not  been  included.  However,  the \npotential for traffic growth to be slightly above the base value has been incorporated in the risk \nanalysis. \n\n5. \n\nEIRR and Sensitivity \n\n36. \nin Table A7.13. \n \n\nThe discounted cash flow, net present value of benefits less costs, and EIRR are shown \n\n \n\n\fTable A7.13: Economic Discounted Cash Flow for Lodoni Road (F$\u2019000, 2008) \n\nVOC Savings, \nby Traffic Type \n\nTravel Time Savings, \nby Traffic Type \n\nNormal  Generated  Diverted  Normal  Generated  Diverted \n\nSingle Lane \nBridge Removal \nBenefits \n\nProducer \nSurplus \nBenefits \n\nNet Benefits \n(Costs) \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.70  \n0.70  \n0.70  \n0.70  \n0.70  \n0.70  \n0.71  \n0.71  \n0.71  \n0.71  \n0.71  \n0.72  \n0.72  \n0.72  \n0.72  \n0.72  \n0.73  \n0.73  \n0.73  \n0.73  \n0.74  \n0.74  \n0.74  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.34  \n0.34  \n0.34  \n0.39  \n0.39  \n0.38  \n0.41  \n0.45  \n0.48  \n0.48  \n0.50  \n0.49  \n0.55  \n0.62  \n0.56  \n0.60  \n0.63  \n0.64  \n0.73  \n0.72  \n0.68  \n0.74  \n0.81  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n0.09  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n\n(7.15)  \n(7.14)  \n2.16  \n2.18  \n2.16  \n2.36  \n2.36  \n2.33  \n2.47  \n1.54  \n2.68  \n2.69  \n2.78  \n2.76  \n2.94  \n3.21  \n2.99  \n2.06  \n3.28  \n3.28  \n3.63  \n3.59  \n3.46  \n3.71  \n3.97  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n\nConstruc-\ntion Costs \n\nMainte-\nnance \nCosts \n\nUndiscounted Costs and Benefits \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \nDiscounted Costs and Benefits \n\n(7.15) \n(7.14)  \n0.00  \n0.02  \n0.02  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.02  \n0.02  \n(1.07)  \n0.02  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.04  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.02  \n(1.07)  \n0.02  \n0.02  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.02  \n0.02  \n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.01  \n0.02  \n0.01  \n\n0.00  \n0.00  \n1.03  \n1.03  \n1.01  \n1.18  \n1.18  \n1.13  \n1.24  \n1.35  \n1.38  \n1.41  \n1.47  \n1.42  \n1.58  \n1.78  \n1.60  \n1.72  \n1.81  \n1.80  \n2.07  \n2.05  \n1.93  \n2.10  \n2.32  \n\nTotal \n\nEIRR \n\n \n\n(12.49)  \n\n0.05  \n\n8.03  \n\n4.36  \n\n0.00  \n\n2.72  \n\n0.53  \n\n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n\n0.00  \n\n       3.19  \n\n15.2% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n\ni\n\n4\n1\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nEIRR  sensitivity  has  been  estimated  with  respect  to  changes  in  the  values of  some  of \n37. \nthe major inputs (Table A7.14). In most cases, the subproject remains economically viable, i.e., \nthe  EIRR  remains  above  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  In  cases  where  the  EIRR  is \nbelow  12%,  the  switching  values  (the  value  needed  to  give  an  EIRR  of  12%)  and  sensitivity \nindexes (the percentage change in the variable divided by the percentage change in the NPV) \nare shown. As with the Kings Road analysis, a test of sensitivity to a reduction in the oil price \nhas  been  included.  The  result  shows  a  marginal  increase  in  the  EIRR  due  to  the  lower \nconstruction cost, which more than offsets the reduction in vehicle operating cost savings. \n \n\nTable A7.14: Sensitivity Tests \n\nScenario \nBase Case \nSensitivity Parameters \n1.

The  simulation  then \nrandomly samples each variable from within these mathematical distributions and recalculates \nthe  EIRR  over  several  thousand  trials,  thus  allowing  an  output  probability  distribution  of  the \nEIRR or other economic indicator to be estimated. On this basis, there is 90% probability that \nthe EIRR for the Project will exceed 12%, and 99.5% probability that the EIRR will exceed 10%. \nThe assumptions made in the risk analysis are shown in Table A7.15. \n \n\nTable A7.15: Risk Analysis Assumptions \n\nParameter \nCapital Cost \nBase Traffic Level \nNormal Traffic Growth \npp = percentage points. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nDistribution \ntriangular \ntriangular \ntriangular \n\nMinimum \n(%) \n(20) \n(25) \n(1.5) pp \n\nMost Likely \nas estimated \nas estimated \nas estimated \n\nMaximum \n(%) \n20 \n25 \n1.5 pp \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 4 February 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Fiji dollar (F$) \n", "F$1.00\nUS$1.00\n", "US$1.8651 \n   F$0.5361 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nADT \nDNR \nEA \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFRUP \nGDP \nHDM \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICB \nIRI \nkm \nLIBOR \nNPV \nPMU \nTA \nvpd \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \naverage daily traffic \nDepartment of National Roads \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nFiji Road Upgrading Project \ngross domestic product \nHighway Development and Management (model) \nhuman immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninternational road roughness index \nkilometer \nLondon interbank offered rate \nnet present value \nproject management unit \ntechnical assistance \nvehicles per day \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "NOTE \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nRegional Director \n \nTeam leader \n \n", "C.
