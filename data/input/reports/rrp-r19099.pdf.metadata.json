An initial environmental examination was undertaken, and\nAssessment a summary is a core appendix.\nSocial A social impact analysis was undertaken, and a summary is a core\nAssessment appendix.\nRationale Although  Bhutan  has  substantial  sources  of  clean  and  renewable\nindigenous hydropower energy, the distribution of electricity throughout\nthe country is still limited, and thus approximately 80 percent of the\npopulation does not have access to electricity. The recent development\nof  social  infrastructure  for  basic  human  needs  such  as  hospitals,\nschools, radio broadcasting, and newspaper publishing has resulted in\nstrong anticipation of electrification for rural communities. In addition,\nrural  electrification  in  the  long  term  will  gradually  decrease  the\npressures  of  deforestation  due  to  one  of  the  world\u2019s  highest\nconsumption of fuelwood. Furthermore, positive impacts on reducing\nmigration to the cities, population control, and overall rural lifestyle, are\nexpected to be substantial in the long term.\nAlong with the proposed Project, the Bank is also playing a pioneering\nrole  in  improving  sector  governance.  Through  three  cascading\ntechnical assistance (TA) grants, Policy and Legal Framework of the\nPower Sector Development approved in 1998, Corporatization of the\nDivision  of  Power,  and  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Hydropower\nDevelopment planned in 1999 and 2001 respectively, the Bank will\nassist in further commercializing of the power sector by establishing\ntransparent and accountable sector operations and an autonomous\npower  utility.  Thus,  the  Project  supports  the  Bank\u2019s  strategy  of\nbalanced  development  between  socioeconomic  priorities  and\ncommercialization of the electricity supply in Bhutan.\nObjectives and The project objectives are to reduce poverty and promote economic\nScope development. The Project will provide opportunities for cash-generating\nbusinesses,  create  jobs,  improve  quality  of  rural  life,  and  support\nadequate education and health services for rural people, especially low-\nincome groups in Bhutan by improving electrification with distribution\nnetwork  expansion  and  use  of  solar  panels.  The  Project  will  also\nfacilitate efficient use of limited skilled human resources of the Division\nof Power (DOP) by introducing a simple Supervisory Control and Data\nAcquisition (SCADA) system and support institutional strengthening by\ncorporatizing DOP.", "ii\nThe Project is an integral part of the rural electrification master plan of\nBhutan.  The  Project  will  provide  power  to  6,038  consumers  in\nrural villages  of  16 districts  where  more  than  two  thirds  of  project\nbeneficiaries  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  project  scope\nincludes  (i)  rural  electrification  through  33  kV,  11  kV,  and  0.4 kV\ndistribution systems; (ii) remote rural electrification using renewable\nenergy sources by providing solar panels for local community centers\nincluding schools,  hospitals, and other  local  community facilities  in\nthree  districts;  and  (iii)  a  small-scale  pilot  SCADA  system  for\nsubstations close to Thimphu.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $12.5 million equivalent, of which\n$10.0 million (80 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $2.5 million\nequivalent(20 percent) is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan          ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency\nBank 10.0 0.0 10.0\nGovernment 0.0 2.5 2.5\nTotal 10.0 2.5 12.5\nLoan Amount The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\nand Terms 7,206,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  the  Bank\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources with a term of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period,\nwith a 1 percent per annum interest charge during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of  Until 30 March 2004\nUtilization\nExecuting Agency DOP  of  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  initially,  and  later,  the\ncorporatized DOP.\nImplementation A project implementation unit will be set up in DOP to undertake day-\nArrangements to-day project implementation.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Sustainable Rural Electrification Project. The report also\ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Corporatization of the Division of Power\n(DOP),  and  if  the proposed  loan  is approved  by the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the  authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. During  the  1998  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan\nconfirmed its request for a Bank loan for the Project and an accompanying advisory TA for the\nCorporatization of DOP. The Project is based on the results of the project preparatory TA\n(PPTA)  funded  by  the  Bank.1  The  proposed  TA  is  a  subsequent  assistance  for  the\ncorporatization of DOP based on the recommendation of the previous Bank\u2019s advisory TA.2\nAppraisal was carried out from 19 to 30 July 1999.3\n3. The Bank is the lead multilateral financing institution in Bhutan and since 1993 has\nplayed a pioneering role in the development of the country\u2019s power sector. Under the ongoing\nloan,4 which was the first loan for the power sector in Bhutan from a multilateral financing\ninstitution, the Bank is undertaking comprehensive policy dialogue with the Government; they\nhave agreed on a time-bound action plan for the corporatization of DOP, as well as retail tariff\nadjustments to prepare for corporatization. This Project will take the reform process further.\n4. Based on a careful field survey and sector analysis, the Bank has sought to balance the\ncommercial and financial development of the power sector with the socioeconomic priority for\nelectricity supply. Considering the institutional and human resource constraints, and absorptive\ncapacity of Bhutan, the reform process for the power sector is staged and is supported by\ncascading TAs. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\n5. Bhutan was virtually isolated from the rest of the world prior to the early 1960s, with an\neconomy based on subsistence agriculture. While work under a series of five-year plans helped\nestablish basic infrastructure in the economy,5 it was not until the 1980s with the commissioning\nof the Chhukha hydropower plant that a diverse economy really began to emerge. With the\nadvent of hydropower in the country, and manufacturing enterprises benefiting from low cost\npower, gross domestic product (GDP) increased in the late 1980s to nearly 8 percent per year.\nWith no large projects coming onstream, industrial growth in Bhutan has slowed in recent years,\nbut the country still maintains GDP growth rates in excess of 5 percent. The Eighth Five-Year\nPlan, FY1998-FY2002 projects average annual GDP growth of 6.5 percent during the plan\nperiod and about 5.5 percent during the first two years of the plan. Although overall growth in\nthe economy is currently on track to achieve the Eighth Plan\u2019s goals, inadequate physical\n                                                       \n1 TA 2912-BHU: Second Rural Electrification Project, for $500,000, approved on 19 November 1997.\n2 TA 2400-BHU: Institutional and Financial Development of DOP, for $400,000, approved on 30 September 1995.\n3 The Mission comprised C. Pappas, Sr. Project Specialist/Mission Leader; Y. Kho, Financial Analyst; S. Handayani,\nSocial Development Specialist; M. Hamano, Project Engineer; S. Ho, Programs Officer/Economist; and C. Gautrot,\nCounsel.\n4 Loan 1375-BHU: Rural Electrification Project, for $7.5 million, approved on 30 September 1995 with the purpose of\nelectrifying about 3,100 customers in seven districts.\n5\nSee also CER: BHU 99012:  Country Economic Review, Bhutan, May 1999.", "2\ninfrastructure, including lack of an efficient road network to markets, remains a major constraint\nto further development of the country in the longer term.\n6. The Government  is  improving  its  development  administration  by  decentralizing  and\ninvolving the people in the policy-making process. The King visited and consulted with people in\nall 20 districts of Bhutan on the Eighth Plan. The King explained the development program in\ntheir districts and listened to their views. Similarly, through the district and local development\ncommittees, decision making has been gradually decentralized and made more participatory. In\naddition, at the last National Assembly, the King withdrew as chair of the Council of Ministers in\nJuly 1998, and the National Assembly elected new cabinet members. At the same time, the\nKing empowered the National Assembly to dismiss him with a vote of no confidence. The\nPlanning Commission of the Government was also recently  reconstituted to  accommodate\nbottom-up planning process from each level of local communities.\n7. Bhutan continued to experience strong growth in production in 1999, with real GDP\ngrowth at 5.8 percent. Because of the Government\u2019s demonstrated support for implementing the\npolicy reforms and fulfilling the goals outlined in the Eighth Plan, the economy should continue\nto experience output growth  in excess  of 5  percent  for  FY1999.  Fiscal  policy  in  FY1998\nremained prudent with current revenues exceeding current expenditures. Although tax revenues\nremain relatively low\u2014less than 7 percent of GDP\u2014preparations for the introduction of personal\nincome tax are still ongoing, and its introduction should help diversify the source of revenues in\nthe country. Corporate taxes and profit transfers from the Chhukha hydropower plant are the\nGovernment\u2019s  main  source  of  revenue,  accounting  for  41  percent  of  current  revenue.\nProvisional estimates show an overall budget surplus of more than 3 percent of GDP in FY1998,\ncompared with a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in the previous year. The scope for monetary\npolicy is limited because of the fixed exchange rate arrangement and the large quantity of Indian\nrupees circulating freely in the economy. Inflation in FY1998 rose to 9 percent from 7.4 percent\nas of the end of 1998.\n8. Exports grew by 12 percent in FY1998 in dollar terms, much higher than the 4 percent\ngrowth in imports. As a result, the trade deficit declined from 9 percent of GDP to 6 percent, and\nthe current account deficit fell from 16 percent of GDP to 12 percent. Bhutan maintained a slight\ntrade surplus with India, the country\u2019s main trading partner, but the bilateral trade in services\ncaused a current account deficit. Capital flows, mostly in the form of aid for infrastructure\ninvestments, were more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit. By the end of the\nfiscal year, foreign reserves exceeded $200 million, enough to cover more than 19 months of\nimports. Debt service in FY1998 was 11 percent of merchandise export earnings, but the\ncountry\u2019s convertible currency inflows will come under increasing pressure as more of the grace\nperiods expire on the concessional debt Bhutan acquired in the 1980s.\n9. Increased efforts will be needed to prevent any deterioration in the fiscal situation, while\nsafeguarding productive expenditures, social services, and operation and maintenance (O&M).\nThe introduction of a personal income tax will be a promising step toward broadening the tax\nbase,  but  direct  cost  recovery  measures,  such  as  introducing  user  fees  and  rationalizing\nelectrical tariffs, also need to be considered. Managing the diverse number of development\nprojects is straining the Government\u2019s limited resources. To effectively manage an increasingly\ncomplex economy, the central Government must devolve some project responsibilities to local\ngovernments. This has the added benefit of increasing community ownership of project results.\nFurthermore, more private sector involvement will be required if the Government is to maintain a\ncompact civil service.", "3\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Energy Consumption and Sources\n10. Bhutan\u2019s  per  capita  energy  consumption  is  relatively  high  compared  with  other\nneighboring countries such as Nepal because its forest resources provide an abundant and\nreadily available source of energy. Per capita energy consumption including noncommercial\nenergy amounts to approximately 0.8 ton of oil equivalent. Although the local units of the\nForestry Services Division are regulating the cutting down of live trees, fuelwood nevertheless\naccounts  for  more  than  75 percent  of  total  energy  consumption  and  for  virtually  all  non-\ncommercial energy consumption in rural areas. Households consume 95 percent of fuelwood,\nthe Government and commercial entities use 3 percent, and agriculture and industry use about\n1  percent.  Per  capita  consumption  of  fuelwood  used  mainly  for  cooking  and  heating  is,\nestimated at 1.22 tons, one of the highest rates in the world.\n11. Since Bhutan has no known reserves of fossil energy resources such as oil and natural\ngas, all petroleum products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel oil, and petrol for\nlighting, cooking, and transportation are imported. The general demand for petroleum products\nhas  been  increasing.  Petroleum  products  are  imported  and  distributed  by  two  private\ncompanies, Bhutan Oil Distribution and Druk Petroleum Company. There are 24 fuel depots\nsituated at convenient points  in  various  districts  (dzongkhags).  The  Ministry  of  Trade  and\nIndustry  (MTI)  regulates  the  price  and  supply  of  petroleum  products  aligned  with  Indian\ndomestic prices. Import details of petroleum  products from 1992 to 1997  are  indicated  in\nTable 1.\nTable 1:  Import of Petroleum Products (1992 to 1997)\nProduct 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997\nKerosene  (kilo liters) 7,122 8,078 6,691 8,236 12,152 9,612\nDiesel  (kilo liters) 16,778 16,461 17,647 21,193 20,343 20,403\nPetrol  (kilo liters) 3,506 3,469 3,530 4,151 3,852 4,122\nLPG  (tons) 720 1,800 1,741 1,675 1,675 2,920\nLPG = Liquefied Petroleum Gas\n12. The most important natural resource of Bhutan is water. The mountainous terrain and\nthe network of perennially flowing rivers and streams provide an abundant source of renewable\nenergy. The four major rivers, Ammochhu, Mangdechhu, Sankosh, and Wangchhu, all flow from\nnorth to south, and discharge into the Brahmaputra River in the plains of India and Bangladesh.\nThese rivers provide significant hydropower potential. Compared with the theoretical potential of\n30,000  megawatts  (MW)  capacity  of  hydropower,  the  identified  hydropower  projects  are\nexpected  to  harness  a  capacity  of  16,280  MW  based  on  the  available  feasibility  and\nprefeasibility studies. This may be compared with the 23 run-of-river hydropower stations with a\ntotal installed capacity of only 344 MW in 1998. Although the domestic peak electricity demand\nis  72  MW,  power exports  to  India  are a  major foreign  exchange  earner  for  Bhutan.  The\nhydropower potential presents a significant opportunity for future expansion and economic\nbenefit, with minimal environmental impacts, in view of an increasingly large export market for\npower in the subregion.\n13. To date, about 60 biogas plants have been built in several districts and are used only for\nlighting. There are 1,316 solar panels existing in remote areas to charge batteries, particularly in\nschools,  basic  health  units,  and  monasteries.  Because  of  sufficient  sunshine  available  in", "4\nBhutan, solar panels have proved to be a viable alternative of providing grid supply to remote\nareas. Experiments with wind energy applications for battery charging are being undertaken in\ntwo districts to determine the sustainability of wind-based generation.\n2.  The Power Sector\na.  Institutional Overview\n14. Under the  current  structure  of  the  power  sector,  policy  making,  regulation,  system\ndevelopment, and operation of the power sector are the responsibility of DOP. DOP distributes\nelectricity  at  the  district  and  village  levels  through  electricity  supply  units  and  electricity\nsupply subunits. In a policy directive issued in late 1993 during the Seventh Five-Year Plan\n(FY1992-FY1997) period, the Government devolved responsibilities for power supply and O&M\nof distribution systems to the district level. This was done in seven districts, in a move designed\nto  improve  effectiveness  and  to  enhance  community  participation  in  planning  and\nimplementation of the electrification program. Decentralization of responsibilities for power is to\nbe eventually extended to all 20 districts of the country.\n15. The Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation (CHPC), which is a wholly Government-owned\ncompany registered under the Bhutan Companies Act, accounts for 336 MW of the country\u2019s\ntotal generating capacity of 359 MW. In FY1997, DOP purchased 360 gigawatt-hours (GWh) or\n94 percent of its requirements from CHPC. That same  year,  CHPC  exported  1,430 GWh\n(78 percent of the energy generated) to India. Further development of the power sector is\ncrucial to allow the Government to generate revenue required for O&M of the sector, future\nexpansion of social programs, and sustained overall economic growth.\n16. The Kurichhu Project Authority was created for the Kurichhu Hydropower Project. The\nKurichhu Project (60 MW, funded by India) in the eastern region and the Basochhu Project\n(60.8 MW, funded by Austria) in the western region will be completed during the Eighth Plan\nperiod. The infrastructure development activities and civil works of the Tala Hydropower Project\n(1,020 MW, funded by India) have also commenced under a separate entity, namely, the Tala\nHydroelectric Project Authority. The governments of Norway and Japan are funding full-scale\ntechnical feasibility studies for the Mangdechhu Hydropower Project (approximately 360 MW)\nand Punatsangchhu Hydropower Project (approximately 760 MW). Mangdechhu Hydropower\nProject feasibility study will be completed by the end of 1999 and the Punatsangchhu feasibility\nstudy by early 2001. Because the Government fully recognizes the implication of hydropower\ndevelopment, environmental and socioeconomic impact analyses have been undertaken as part\nof the detailed feasibility studies of these two new hydropower projects in accordance with\ninternationally acceptable guidelines.\nb.  Supply and Demand\n17. In FY1997, the total electricity consumption of Bhutan was 366 GWh with peak demand\nof  72  MW.  The  five-year  average  of  the  load  growth  since  FY1992  was  approximately\n19 percent per annum on energy basis. This high load growth was due to the commissioning of\nseveral electricity-intensive industries such as Bhutan Board Products Ltd., Bhutan Carbide and\nChemicals Ltd., and Pendon Cement Authority Ltd. from FY1995 to 1996. Another electricity-\nintensive industry, Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd. was commissioned in 1993. The share of the\nindustry sector reached about 82 percent in FY1997 of total energy sold by DOP. The historic\nannual load growth of the residential and commercial customers of DOP is about 5 percent per", "5\nannum. By the end of FY1997, DOP consumers totaled 30,321, and 39 towns and 363 rural\nvillages were electrified by DOP.\n18. The  total  energy  requirement  of  DOP  was  383  GWh  in  FY1997;  CHPC  supplied\n361 GWh directly to DOP\u2019s transmission network at the price of Nu0.30 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nIn addition, 7 GWh was purchased from CHPC through the Indian grid system with the wheeling\ncharge of Nu0.05 per kWh. The balance was supplied by mini- and microhydropower plants as\nwell as diesel generators through their dedicated isolated networks. The average system loss of\ntransmission and distribution systems including nontechnical losses, in the past five years was\nabout  9  percent.  This  performance  is  mainly  due  to  the  large  share  of  the  high  voltage\ncustomers such as electricity-intensive industries. The system loss of low voltage customers is\napproximately 15 percent. Under the current power purchase agreement with India, CHPC has\nno obligation for power export to India on a fixed amount (capacity and energy) basis. The first\npriority is to supply the necessary electricity to DOP for domestic consumers, and the balance of\nelectricity output of CHPC is to be exported to India. The power supply and energy balances of\nDOP from FY1991 to FY1997 are given in Appendix 2.\nc. Existing Power System\n19. A milestone event for the power sector was the commissioning of the first unit of the\nChhukha hydropower plant in 1986 with assistance from the Government of India. By 1988,\nthree further units had been commissioned at Chhukha, increasing its total installed capacity to\n318 MW. With  completion  of  the  second  tailrace  tunnel  in  1995,  the  installed  capacity  of\nChhukha reached 336 MW. Since commissioning of the first unit, 85 to 90 percent of generated\nelectricity has been exported to India. Chhukha is the largest single foreign exchange earner of\nBhutan. Because Bhutan could not finance Chhukha\u2019s investment costs and revenues of the\npower export were in Indian rupees, which were not convertible at that time, the Project was\ndeveloped on a grant and loan basis by the Government of India. In return, India receives\nChhukha\u2019s excess electricity for 99 years.\n20. Although  the  Chhukha  hydropower  plant  has  the  dominant  capacity,  there  are\n8 minihydro  plants  with  capacities  ranging  from  300  kilowatt  (kW)  to  1,500  kW,  and\n14 microhydro plants with capacities ranging from 20 kW to 200 kW. The total installed capacity\nof microhydropower plants reached 1,000 kW.\n21. Electrification of the eastern and central parts of Bhutan was achieved using the Indian\ngrid system. During 1969-1970, the Gelephu, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Sarpang districts in the\nsouthern  part  of  Bhutan  were  electrified  through  connection  to  the  grid  of  Assam  State\nElectricity Board of India. Similarly, the commissioning of the Jaldakha hydropower plant in 1972\nin West Bengal led to the electrification of the neighboring districts of Phuntsholing, Samtse, and\nSipsoo in Bhutan through the West Bengal State Electricity Board of India.\n22. The  current  transmission  and  distribution  system  in  Bhutan  comprises  three\ncomponents: (i) the western grid system supplying electricity to the western part of Bhutan\nincluding Thimphu, fed from Chhukha and other small power plants, and connected to the\n220 kV Indian grid system for power  export from  Chhukha;  (ii)  local  transmission network\nsupplied from the Indian grid system such as Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar electric supply\nunits served by Assam State Electricity Board and Samtse district served by West Bengal State\nElectricity Board; and (iii) isolated local distribution network served by mini/microhydropower\nplants such as Bumthang and Trashigang electric supply units. A 132 kV transmission line\nassociated with the Kurichhu Hydropower Project and a 400 kV transmission line to evacuate", "6\npower from the Tala Hydropower Project are presently under construction and are being funded\nby the Government of India. Details of the major components of the existing power system in\nBhutan are given in Appendix 3.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n23. Under the Eighth Plan, the Government aims to accelerate growth and improve living\nstandards, while ensuring the preservation of the country\u2019s environment and cultural heritage.\nThe Government also aims to build and improve the enabling environment for private sector\ndevelopment  by  gradually  reducing  its  own  role  in  commercial  areas  of  the  economy  by\ncorporatizing or privatizing public sector entities, and by addressing structural and institutional\nconstraints.  Postal  services  and  urban  services  were  corporatized  in  1997,  and\ntelecommunications  will  be  corporatized  in  FY2000.  The  Plan  also  focuses  on  revenue-\ngenerating  hydropower  development  and  industrialization,  human  resource  development,\nagriculture, and social services, mainly through expansion, consolidation, and improvement of\nthe existing facilities. The share of electricity in GDP will be maintained at above 8 percent\nduring the entire Eighth Plan period. To achieve this, the Government is currently constructing\nthe three hydropower projects:  Basochhu, Kurichhu, and Tala.\nC.  External Assistance to the Power Sector\n24. The Government of India provides more aid to the sector than any other funding source,\nand has contributed greatly to the expansion of the power sector. The Government of India has\nfunded all three (Chhukha [336 MW], Kurichhu [60 MW], and Tala [1,020 MW] of the major\nhydropower plants together with their associated high voltage transmission lines for evacuation\nof the generated power from these plants. In addition, from 1967 to 1988, the Government of\nIndia assisted with the installation of  minihydropower  plants  in  Gidagom, Gyetsa,  Khaling,\nMongar, Paro, Trashigang, Thimphu, and Wangdue Phodrang. The total capacity of these\nminihydropower plants was 4.9 MW in 1997. Rehabilitation of the existing minihydropower\nplants and urban distribution system continues to be assisted by the Government of India.\n25. Japan too has been a major contributor to the  power  sector.  From 1986 to 1992,\n13 microhydropower  plants  with  total  capacity  of  980  kW  were  commissioned  for  the\nelectrification of isolated remote areas of Bhutan through the assistance of the Government of\nJapan. These microhydro plants  were  constructed under  a  self-help  scheme  in  which  the\nvillagers provided free labor and customers paid for wiring of their homes. Japan in continuing\nits involvement through the feasibility study for the Punatsangchhu Hydropower Project.\n26. The Government of Austria is another major bilateral source of aid to the power sector\nby financing the Basochhu hydropower plant (60 MW) located in the Sankosh River basin. It\nalso funded the 2.2 MW Rangjung scheme in Trashigang District, which was commissioned in\n1998. The Government of Austria is also considering providing assistance for human resource\ndevelopment of DOP in association with the Bank.\n27. The Government of Netherlands provided assistance with rural electrification for about\n1,200 households from 1995 to 1998. It also assisted with the installation of solar home systems\nduring the same period.\n28. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Norway\nfunded the Bhutan Power System Master Plan as a World Bank-executed project in 1993.\nCurrently, UNDP is undertaking a feasibility study of mini/microhydropower plants funded by the", "7\nGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Government of Sweden. The governments of\nNorway and Japan are funding full-scale technical feasibility studies for the Mangdechhu and\nPunatsangchhu hydropower projects respectively. The studies will be completed by 2000.\n29. The Bank\u2019s operation for the Bhutan power sector commenced in 1993. Since then, the\nBank has provided one loan (footnote 4) and 5 TAs\u20142 PPTAs and 3 advisory TAs out of which,\none PPTA and one advisory TA are still being implemented.6  Along with project implementation\nfor the sustainable development of the power sector, the Bank has focused on the institutional\ndevelopment of the power sector and sector reform, which are not being covered by other\nfunding agencies. The list of the external assistance from 1993 onward is given in Appendix 4.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n30. To date, the Bank has provided grants for two PPTAs and two advisory TAs, and\nfinanced one loan for the rural electrification program. Another advisory TA for Policy and Legal\nFramework for Power Sector Development commenced in May 1999. The major obstacles\nidentified for power sector reform are (i) the constraints of absorptive capacity and human\nresources  in  technical  and  commercial  fields,  (ii)  lack  of  a  human  resource  development\nprogram for the sector, (iii) weaker initiative of the Government to corporatize DOP compared\nwith hydropower projects or corporatization of other sectors such as telecommunications, and\n(iv) the Government\u2019s historical reluctance to increase tariffs.\n31. Considering  the human  resource  constraints  and  institutional  capacity,  it  has  been\nagreed to undertake a phased approach to sector reforms supported by a group of cascading\nTAs. Three TAs, namely Policy and Legal Framework for Power Sector Development approved\nin  1998,  and  Corporatization  of  DOP  and  Solicitation  of  Private  Sector  Participation  in\nHydropower Development planned in 1999 and 2001 respectively are therefore included in the\nBank\u2019s country assistance program. Under these TAs, necessary institutional capability for\ncommercialization of the sector will be created in a gradual and structured manner.\n32. As  part  of  the  Institutional  and  Financial  Development  of  DOP  TA,  a  commercial\naccounting  system  was  created  for  DOP;  it  is  to  be  fully  implemented  when  DOP  is\ncorporatized. In the meantime, DOP is to use portions of the system concurrently with the\nexisting Government accounting system. However, two of the critical staff trained under the TA\nwere transferred to other Government departments, and the momentum for preparing to convert\nto the new accounting system was lost. Under the proposed Project, the Government has\nagreed to appoint one dedicated project manager and at least two financial/accounting officers\nto implement and expand the commercial accounting system. As a result of the earlier problems\nand to ensure that the Government takes ownership of the TA to develop a policy and legal\nframework for power sector development7, the Bank insisted that DOP establish a counterpart\nsteering committee and a working group for the TA prior to the commencement of consulting\nservices.8\n                                                       \n6 TA 2912-BHU:   Second Rural Electrification Project, for  $600,000,  approved on 19 November 1997 and\nTA 3112-BHU:    Policy and Legal Framework for Power Sector Development,  for  $500,000  approved  on\n15 December 1998.\n7\nTA  3112-BHU:    Policy and Legal Framework for Power Sector Development,  for  $500,000  approved  on\n15 December 1998.\n8\nThe committee comprises nine members drawn from MTI, DOP, Ministry of Finance, Planning Commission, and\nthe High Court. The working group comprises four representatives from DOP and one representative from MTI.", "8\n33. The Bank\u2019s ongoing rural electrification project is delayed by approximately one year\nbecause of (i) lack of submission of bids from international bidders; (ii) delayed transport of\nmaterials and equipment due to geographical difficulties; (iii) insufficient experience of local\ncontractors; and (iv) force majeure due to heavy rain in 1998. Despite the difficulties, these\nobstacles have been overcome. DOP determined the optimum contract sizes that will attract\ninternational bidders, and established logistics such as stores functions in several districts.\nA suitable organizational setup has been established in DOP to supervise implementation work\nin remote districts in association with district offices. DOP confirmed that it will maintain the\nsame organization and facilities with necessary strengthening for the proposed Project.\nE.  The Bank\u2019s Sector Strategy\n34. The Bank\u2019s sector strategy is integrated into the country strategy for Bhutan and aims to\nestablish sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Bhutan  is endowed  with  large\nhydropower resources. Expansion of hydropower generation capacity has supported the growth\nof electricity-intensive industries in recent years. Similarly, revenue from power export has been\nable to finance the rapid expansion of social services. To realize the sustainable operation of\nthe power sector, the Bank\u2019s key concerns are (i) the restructuring of the power sector by\ncorporatizing  DOP,  and  enacting  laws  on  national  energy  policy  and  regulation;  (ii)  tariff\nadjustment based on full cost recovery of the power supply; (iii) human resource development\nfor  the  corporatized  DOP;  (iv)  commercialization  of  the  sector;  and  (v)  private  sector\nparticipation especially in hydropower generation for the midterm, which will be for power export\nto India.\n35. As part of this strategy, the Bank approved its first loan to the power sector for Rural\nElectrification in 1995 together with a Bank TA for Institutional and Financial Development of\nDOP (footnote 2). This has provided an impetus for sector reform. The Bank will continue to\nfocus on institutional development of DOP as well as the power sector, commercialization,\nprivate sector participation, and tariff structure adjustment to reflect the economic cost of power\nsupply. The Bank\u2019s continuous support for the power sector, including the proposed Project will\nrequire compliance with the agreed sector reforms, such as implementation of the agreed action\nplan for corporatization of DOP and domestic tariff adjustment.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n36. Since 1993, the Bank has played a pioneering role and provided a driving force for\npower sector reform in Bhutan as the lead multilateral financing institution. As a result  of\nagreements reached in the earlier project, the Government increased tariffs in 1 April 1995, from\nNu0.4 to Nu0.5 per kWh (a 25 percent increase) and on 1 July 1997, from Nu0.5 to Nu0.6 per\nkWh (a 20 percent increase). Further in March 1998, the Government agreed to a time-bound\naction  plan  for  sector  reform.  This  includes  (i)  implementation  of  the  tariff  structure\nrecommended by the Bank TA (footnote 2) in FY2001; (ii) ratifying the new legislation of the\npower sector in FY2002 based on the recommendation of another Bank TA (footnote 7); and\n(iii) gradual overall tariff increase to meet the agreed financial targets of the corporatized DOP\nby the end of FY2005. For the institutional development of DOP, it was agreed to (i) implement\na full commercial accounting  system  in  2000;  (ii)  complete  the asset evaluation  by  2001;\n(iii) complete the registration of DOP as a company (per the Companies Act) by FY2002. The\nBank  will  assist  with  this  institutional  development  through  the  accompanying  TA  to  the\nproposed loan. The time-bound action plan reflecting the policy dialogue is given in Appendix 5.", "9\n1.  Legal and Policy Framework\n37. The  Government  recognizes  that  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  such  as  an\nelectricity act and its appropriate subsidiary legislation is necessary for sector development and\nregulation. The Government has agreed to segregate utility operation from policy making and\nregulation to ensure an efficient and financially viable sector structure and grant autonomy to\nthe corporatized DOP. After new legislation for the power sector is established with the Bank\u2019s\nassistance, DOP will be transformed from a Government division into an autonomous and\nfinancially viable corporate entity, and the Government\u2019s role will be  reduced  to  that  of a\nregulator and a policymaker. Such a sector structure with transparent administrative tariff setting\nwill help to ensure the financial viability of the sector. The new legislation will be ratified by the\nend  of  FY2002  prior  to  the  corporatization  of  DOP.  The  Government  also  agrees  that  a\ntransparent  administrative  tariff  adjustment  scheme  will  be  implemented,  such  as  tariff\nadjustment to foreign currency fluctuation and domestic inflation. Under such a tariff adjustment,\nthe Government will consider approving DOP\u2019s proposal on tariff adjustment within a reasonable\nperiod in accordance with the new legislation for the power sector.\n2.  Corporatization of DOP and Human Resource Development\n38. The  DOP\u2019s  present  financial  and  accounting  system  follows  a  government  budget\nsystem.  Thus,  as  the  first  step  of  the  action  plan  under  the  institutional  and  financial\ndevelopment  TA  (footnote  2),  DOP  implemented  a pilot  commercial  accounting  system to\nseparate its accounting system from that of the Government. The Government will commence\nimplementing the full commercial accounting system as per the agreed action plan. In addition,\nthe institutional capability of engineering fields such as the creation of master plans, system\nplanning, investment standards, and technical standards will be established in DOP prior to its\ncorporatization.\n39. The requirement for human resource development for a corporatized DOP is substantial.\nThe Bank has therefore taken the initiative to bring in external assistance and is leading aid\ncoordination on this matter. Along with the Bank\u2019s proposed TA for Corporatization of DOP, the\nGovernment of Austria will provide assistance for technical training and the E-7 network/fund9\nwill provide expertise on utility management to DOP. The Bank has previously financed the\nRoyal Institute of Management10 for overall human resource development in Bhutan. The Royal\nInstitute  has  confirmed  its  availability  and  cooperation  to  support  DOP\u2019s  human  resource\ndevelopment. Details of the current human resource development plan are given in Appendix 6.\n40. Because of the constraints of human resources, institutional capability, and small system\nsize  of  the  power  sector  of  Bhutan,  a  simple  sector  structure  would  be  preferable.  The\nGovernment has agreed in principle on the direction proposed by the Bank for corporatizing\nDOP. However, the Government feels that electricity supply in Bhutan has the characteristic of a\nbasic social service. In addition, the power sector, especially hydropower generation is expected\nto play a significant role as a major export industry. Therefore, the Government will always have\na role in the power sector and recognizes that its role as an operator needs to be segregated\nfrom that as a regulator.\n                                                       \n9 The E7 network is the nonprofit organization to assist sustainable development of the power sector in developing\ncountries. It comprises eight major utilities in G7 countries.\n10 The Royal Institute of Management was established in 1986 and completely restructured in 1997, funded by the\nBank (Loan 1035-BHU:  Technical and Vocational Education and Training), for $7.13 million, approved on\n27 September 1990.", "10\n41. The Government\u2019s aim is that all major hydropower projects be planned as separate\nentities.  It  is therefore  logical for  DOP to  be  structured  as  the  national  transmission  and\ndistribution power utility with small hydropower and diesel generators. In such a structure, DOP\nwill generate revenues mainly from wheeling charges and domestic electricity distribution and\nwill achieve the agreed financial targets with an overall electricity tariff at Nu1.0 per kWh and a\nwheeling charge of about Nu0.12/kWh in FY2005. The explicit tariff increase will be decided\nafter  asset evaluation  under  the  accompanying  TA  in  accordance  with  the  corporate  and\nfinancial structure of the corporatized DOP.\n3. Tariff Adjustment\n42. Bhutan by virtue of its export of power has two tariffs, an export tariff and a domestic\ntariff.\na.  Export Tariff\n43. CHPC exports its power to India after satisfying domestic requirements,11 and the export\ntariff  is determined based  on  negotiations  between  the  two  governments.  The  agreement\nbetween Bhutan and India provides for a tariff revision every four years; however, in reality the\nadjustments have been made more frequently, within a 2- or 3-year period. A tariff adjustment\nwas  made  in  April  1997  from  Nu0.5  to  Nu1.0  per  kWh.  Following  the  latest  round  of\nnegotiations, the export tariff was increased from Nu1.0 per kWh to Nu1.5 per kWh as of\n1 July 1999. It is evident that through the export of power to India the power sector in Bhutan\nhas become financially viable as a whole and provides substantial revenues to the Government.\nWith the increase in export tariff, revenues from power accounts for one half of the country\u2019s\ntotal revenue. The new hydropower projects under construction will also be oriented toward the\nexport of power to India. The Government has a strong desire to establish a transparent and\ncommercial export tariff  setting for  the future  hydropower  projects under study.  The  Bank\nintends to assist in this matter through a planned TA in 2001 for private sector participation in\nhydropower development.\nb. Domestic Tariff\n44. Prior to 1 July 1997, the Government adopted a simple, uniform tariff for all categories of\ncustomers in all districts in Bhutan. In the mid 1980s, the uniform tariff was Nu0.7 per kWh, and\nafter the commissioning of the Chhukha hydropower plant in 1987, due to excess power and its\nability to export power to India, the Government decided to reduce the domestic tariff to Nu0.4\nper  kWh.  Since  the  Bank\u2019s  first  power  project  in  1995,  the  Bank  recommended  that  the\nGovernment gradually increase the domestic tariff so as to recover the cost of supply, and, in\nthe midterm the tariff structure should be rationalized. Although DOP purchases power from\nCHPC at Nu0.30 per kWh, the investment costs on transmission and distribution need to be\nrecovered. Therefore, the tariff was subsequently increased to Nu0.5 per kWh in 1995, and to\nNu0.6 per kWh for urban and industrial customers in July 1997.\n45. The current electricity supply in Bhutan is characterized by (i) low generation cost as the\ncost of CHPC is considered as the generation cost for the domestic market because DOP is\npermitted to consume the output power of CHPC up to its full capacity; (ii) the current share of\nlow and medium voltage consumers, which are mainly residential and commercial consumers,\nis small, and CHPC has sufficient capacity to supply electricity to such consumers for more than\n30 years; (iii)  further  investment for hydropower generation  and  transmission  are  targeted\nmainly for export, and their cost recovery can  be achieved through the export tariff.\n                                                       \n11 Domestic consumption accounts for about 20 percent of CHPC total generation.", "11\n46. However, the domestic electricity tariff, which is set much below the export tariff, is an\nopportunity loss for Bhutan. This applies particularly to those electricity-intensive industries that\nare largely oriented to the Indian market. Although there could be some added value to Bhutan\u2019s\neconomy (i.e., through additional employment and taxes) in providing electricity at the present\nlow rates to such industries, the gap between the domestic and export tariffs needs to be\nreduced  to  mitigate  fiscal  losses  to  the  Government.  Furthermore,  as  the  industry  sector\nrepresents about 80 percent of domestic electricity sales, potential opportunity losses to the\nGovernment and  hence to a  corporatized  DOP  could  be  substantial,  and thus  cannot  be\nignored.\n47. Following the ongoing policy dialogue with the Bank since the last Fact-Finding Mission\nin February 1999, DOP submitted a proposal to the Government to increase the electricity tariff\nto urban/industrial consumers to Nu0.8/kWh. Due to strong resistance from industries, at the\nrequest by the Government the Bank provided assistance to study the impact of the tariff\nincrease on major industries. The study showed that one of the major industries, Bhutan Ferro\nAlloys Limited (BFAL), is not in a condition to absorb the tariff increase up to the proposed level\nthis year. Its current financial condition is not healthy, as it was struck by natural disasters in\n1998. BFAL currently consumes about 50 percent of total industry consumption in the country.\nThe Government is reluctant to increase the electricity tariff to Nu0.8/kWh, as it will have\nsubstantial negative impact on industry, particularly at a time when it wants to promote the\ndevelopment of these industries. The Government further argues that the incremental revenues\nfrom increasing the tariff are negligible given the total revenues the country receives from\npower, and that the only advantage from the point of view of these industries is the cheap\npower. The Government also pointed out that if the industries are subjected to such a high tariff\nincrease, their consumption of power would substantially reduce as some of them may close\ndown,  thereby  further  reducing  the  volume  of  internal  power  sales  by  DOP.  The  Bank\nunderstands the Government\u2019s position, although it also pointed out that BFAL\u2019s weak financial\ncondition is merely due to last year\u2019s unfortunate incidents, which resulted in a major loss of\ninventory. Therefore, to give more breathing space to BFAL, the Bank proposed, and the\nGovernment agreed, to increase the tariff to urban/industrial consumers from Nu0.60/kWh to\nNu0.70/kWh (an increase of 17 percent) as of 1 January 2000; the increase to Nu0.8/kWh will\nbe effective on 1 July 2001 (a further increase of 14 percent). Cabinet approval for these tariff\nadjustments was obtained on 24 August 1999.\n48. With  regard to  rural  consumers, the  Bank  agreed  to  maintaining  the  rural  tariff  at\nNu0.50/kWh in line with the socioeconomic and environmental objectives of electricity supply in\nthe rural areas. However, it remains concerned with the current geographical and uniform tariff\nscheme, where rural consumers pay a lower tariff, as this could undermine the financial viability\nof the Project, which caters mainly to the rural areas. The Bank pointed out that a large\npercentage of consumers of the current tariff scheme are relatively well off. Although at present,\nthe impact is not significant as consumers in rural areas represent a very small percentage of\ntotal electricity consumption (3 percent), the fact that the  Government  intends to  increase\nelectrification in the rural areas, could affect DOP's financial position over the long term. The\ntariff study addressed this issue, and based on the result of the study and to ensure adequate\ncost recovery (while taking into account the Government\u2019s social objectives) is reflected in the\ntariff, it was agreed that the Government will introduce a two-part tariff for high and medium\nvoltage consumers and a three-block tariff for low voltage consumers. The high and medium\nvoltage consumers will pay energy and demand charges. The low voltage consumers will be\ndivided into low-end, medium-end, and high-end consumers. Of the three blocks, the first block\ncontains consumers for whom a social rate can be applied. The proposed tariff structure will\nallow contribution to capital costs to be reflected in the rate and provides for cross subsidy to the", "12\npoor who consumed minimal electricity. Based on the survey conducted by the tariff study, a\nlifeline or social rate was recommended at 80 kWh per month. In this context, the Government\nagreed to implement the tariff structure by the end of FY2001.\n49. The proposed tariff structure will also help DOP as it plans to become a corporate entity\nin the near future. Being an independent company separate from the Government\u2019s budgetary\nsystem, DOP will need to be financially self-sustainable, and thus tariffs need to be adjusted to\nenable DOP to meet its financial requirements. Based on the assumptions taken, for DOP to\nreach the financial targets once it is corporatized, the overall average tariffs and the wheeling\ncharge will have to be gradually increased to reach Nu1.0 per kWh and Nu0.12 per kWh,\nrespectively by FY2005. The explicit tariff adjustments and wheeling charges will be determined\nonce the valuation of DOP assets is completed, currently planned for FY2001.\n4. Private Sector Participation in Hydropower Development\n50. Up until now, the Indian Government has  been  the main  hydropower development\nfinancier in Bhutan. However, it is perceived that the Indian Government has limited resources\nand that after the Tala plant, it may not be in a position  to finance further projects.  The\nGovernment therefore recognizes that other foreign investment will be required to achieve the\nplanned  investments  for  hydropower  development.  The  sector  requires  large  amounts  of\nfunding from bilateral, multilateral, as well as private sector sources. A policy and guidelines to\nattract foreign  investments  for  hydropower  projects  needs  to  be  developed  based  on  the\nelectricity act. Therefore, in December 1998, the Bank approved a TA (footnote 7) to assist the\nGovernment in developing this act, which includes the policy and legal framework for the power\nsector, and private sector participation in the power sector, especially in hydropower projects.\n51. Such policy and guidelines for private sector participation to be developed by 2001 will\ninclude  feasible  project  structures,  financing  schemes,  ownership  arrangements,  mitigating\ncurrency convertibility risks, creation of security package, issues on taxation and provision for\nrisk sharing between the various parties. Under the TA, large foreign borrowing and investments\nwill be carefully analyzed, from the viewpoints of macroeconomy, balance of payment, and\nforeign  currency  reserves  of  Bhutan.  The  Government  and  the  Bank  will  maintain  close\ncooperation with the other aid agencies during the TA implementation.\n52. Furthermore, the Government fully recognizes the importance of transparent and fair\ncompetition with a well-formulated project structure for solicitation of proposals from private\ndevelopers.  In  this  context,  the  Bank  agreed  to  provide  TA  to  establish  such  solicitation\nprocedures.  It  will  include  preparation  of  solicitation/requests  for  proposal  documents\ncomprising  technical and financial  requirements, power  purchase agreement,  water  supply\nagreement, and other necessary documents to invite project developers for future hydropower\nprojects such as Mangdechhu (funded by the Government of Austria) and Punatsangchhu\n(funded by the Government of Japan).\n5.  Sustainable Rural Electrification\n53. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY1987-FY1991), a rural electrification program using\nhydropower was formulated to cover most villages in Bhutan. However, due to lack of finance\nand  human  resources, the  actual  achievement  was  minimal of  what  was  planned.  In  the\nSeventh Plan (FY1992-FY1997), the Government gave high priority to the  remaining  rural\nelectrification and intended to implement rural electrification on a realistic scale. This program\nwas delayed and is now expected to be completed in 1999 with Bank assistance. At the end of", "13\nFY1997, 39 towns and 363 villages were electrified, and the total number of DOP customers\nwas 30,321. The household electrification ratio was approximately 28 percent in FY1998.\n54. Under the Eighth Plan, the Government intends to electrify rural households in 17 of\n20 districts of Bhutan. Most of the areas in the program are located in the vicinity of existing\n132-kilovolt (kV) and 66-kV transmission lines. However, because of the enlarged project area,\ngeographically scattered and isolated customers, rural electrification only by the transmission\nand distribution system is not feasible from technical and financial viewpoints. Therefore, the\nrural  electrification  program  in  the  proposed  Project  will  utilize  existing  generation  from\nmini/microhydropower  stations,  as  well  as  use  solar panels for  important  local  community\nfacilities in remote areas.\n55. UNDP has confirmed its assistance for mini/microhydropower plants to remote villages\nusing a grant from the Government of Sweden and GEF in areas to be served by the Project.\nUNDP\u2019s consultants commenced their work in April 1999 and are expected to complete project\ndesign in December 1999. The transmission line plan created under the Bank PPTA was\nprovided to UNDP\u2019s consultants to identify suitable sites based on a least-cost analysis.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n56. Although Bhutan has substantial sources of clean and renewable hydropower energy\nand exports power to India, distribution of electricity throughout the country is still limited. By the\nend of FY1997, approximately 80 percent of the population, mainly in rural areas, did not have\naccess to electricity.12 Since 1981, the Government, has addressed balanced regional growth\nthrough community consultation and a participatory approach. Health services, construction and\nmaintenance of feeder and farm roads, and primary education have been decentralized. Local\ncommunities (gewogs) now take part in the planning, implementation, and management of\nsocial infrastructure. To date, most rural communities have access to hospitals, primary schools,\nand  local  markets  in  their  communities,  but  many  of  these  facilities  lack  electricity.  The\ndevelopment of such social infrastructure for basic human needs has resulted in strong demand\nfor electricity in rural communities. Rural people now desire electricity to be provided to their\nhouseholds, schools, hospitals, and other community establishments. The Project is primarily\naimed at the poorer members of Bhutan\u2019s rural community, as more than two thirds of its direct\nbeneficiaries (69.8 percent) live below the estimated poverty line.13  The provision of electricity is\nexpected to reduce poverty in rural areas by increasing opportunities for employment and\naccess to improved (through electrification) government services such as education and health.\nThe Project is also expected to have a positive impact on reducing migration to the cities and\npopulation control.\n57. Fuelwood consumption in Bhutan at 1.22 tons per capita is one of the highest in the\nworld.  Fuelwood  accounts  for  approximately  77  percent  of  total  energy  consumption  and\nvirtually all noncommercial energy consumption as forest resources provide an abundant and\nreadily available source of energy. This increases the pressure on deforestation in Bhutan.\nCollecting fuelwood is done by each household, with an estimated labor cost of Nu780 per\ncapita. More than 30 percent of household owners are women; they will benefit substantially\n                                                       \n12 Loan 1375-BHU:  Rural Electrification Project, for $7.5 million, was approved on 30 September 1995 with the\npurpose of providing electricity to about 3,100 consumers in seven districts.\n13 Poverty line per household, Nu4,032 per month, is derived from average occupancy per house (8) times the\nestimated poverty line per person (Nu504 per month).", "14\nfrom rural electrification as they spend more time in their households and  hence  will  use\nimproved lighting and any household appliances more. Electrification of rice mills and other\ngrain and food processing facilities will also reduce women\u2019s workload in the home. In addition,\nusing  fuelwood  for  cooking  and  heating  causes  respiratory  diseases  among  women  and\nchildren as they usually spend longer times in the home than do men.14 Based on the PPTA\nsurvey findings, it is estimated that a 10 percent immediate decrease of fuelwood consumption\nwill be achieved due to the proposed Project, and electrification will gradually further decrease\nfuelwood consumption in the long term as usage of electric heaters and water heaters increases\nin Thimphu and other towns.\n58. Under the Government policy of using a participatory approach for rural infrastructure,\nthe rural electrification program during the Eighth Plan (1998-2002) was created based on the\nconsensus of local communities. Close consultation with the beneficiary local communities was\nundertaken during the technical feasibility study and socioeconomic study under  the  Bank\nPPTA. To maximize the development impact of rural electrification, the application of solar\npanels in local community centers comprising hospitals, schools, and other local community\nfacilities is integrated in the Project based on other successful operations in Bhutan.\n59. Among aid agencies, the Bank is taking a lead role in assisting with the power sector\nreform in the country. The Bank has maintained close consultation with UNDP/GEF, and other\nbilateral sources of aid, such as Austria. The Bank\u2019s initiatives for power sector reform will be\nenhanced by the three cascading TAs. The reform measures intend to commercialize the power\nsector by establishing transparent and accountable sector operation and an autonomous power\nutility.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  also  addressing  DOP\u2019s  human  resource  constraints  by\nintroducing advanced technology such as supervisory, control, and data acquisition system\n(SCADA),15 which will efficiently utilize qualified technical staff in DOP.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n60. The  primary  objective  of  the  Project  is  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  provide\nopportunities  for  cash-generating  business,  job  creation,  improvement  of  rural  life,  and\nstrengthening education and health services to rural people, especially low-income groups, in\nBhutan through electrification by locally generated hydropower from existing power stations and\nsolar panels. Women will also be major beneficiaries of the Project as over 30 percent of\nhousehold owners in the country are women. Provision of electricity under this Project will\ndirectly improve rural life and fully support other social infrastructure such as village hospitals\nand schools. An immediate tangible economic benefit is  reduced expenditure on  imported\nkerosene and to a small extent the use of fuelwood. In the long term, rural electrification will\nfurther reduce the use of fuelwood and decrease the pressure of deforestation. In addition, the\nProject will facilitate efficient human resource utilization of DOP by introducing a simple SCADA\nsystem for the planned corporatization of DOP.\n61. The Project is an integral part of the rural electrification program, which was created\nduring  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan.  The  Project  will  provide  access  to  electricity  to  6,038\nconsumers in rural villages in 16 districts (7 districts in the Western Region, 4 districts in the\nCentral Region, and 5 districts in the Eastern Region). The number of consumers will increase\nby about 20 percent and the household electrification ratio will go up to about 33 percent. With\nthe applying of SCADA, approximately 20 scarce technical staff working in substations of DOP\ncan  be  transferred  to  other  urgently  necessary  fields.  The  Project  comprises  (i)  rural\n                                                       \n14 Respiratory infections accounted for roughly 20 percent of the patients treated in 1994.\n15 SCADA will be utilized for remote control of a power system.", "15\nelectrification of distribution system to 6,010 consumers including 23 hospitals, 24 primary\nschools, and other public facilities for local communities; (ii) remote rural electrification in three\ndistricts including 4 schools, 4 hospitals, and 20 other local community facilities by renewable\nenergy sources using solar panels; and (iii) a small-scale pilot SCADA system for substations\nclose to Thimphu. The detailed project description is given in Appendix 7.\nC.  Technical Justification\n62. The Project represents the least-cost solution for providing electricity to selected rural\nvillages in Bhutan based on a comparison with other alternate power systems. Based on the\nrural electrification master plan, rural electrification of villages is to be  accomplished by  a\ndistribution network from the grid system to provide a reliable and sufficient supply to meet the\nforecasted demand. In remote villages, where electrification by a distribution system is not\nfinancially and technically feasible, solar panels were chosen to provide electricity to hospitals,\nschools, and other local community facilities to maximize their development impact.\n63. The design of the distribution network considers both current distribution practices in\nBhutan, lessons learned from the ongoing project, and cost-effective construction in accordance\nwith international practices. The design includes (i) continuous adoption of the International\nElectrotechnical Commission standards for most electrical equipment and materials to facilitate\ninternational competitive bidding (ICB); (ii) improvement of portability of heavy equipment and\nmaterials considering geographic difficulties; and (iii) least-cost application of 11 kV and 33 kV\ndistribution networks considering future load growth.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n64. The Project cost is estimated at $12.5 million equivalent, comprising $10.0 million in\nforeign  exchange  costs  (80  percent)  and  $2.5  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs\n(20 percent). The summary is in Table 3 and the details are given in Appendix 8.\nTable 3:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Exchange Local Currency Total Cost\nBase Cost\nRE by distribution system 8.2 2.1 10.3\nRE by solar panels 0.1 0.0 0.1\nSmall-scale pilot SCADA 0.3 0.0 0.3\nSubtotal 8.6 2.1 10.7\nTax and duties 0.0 0.0 0.0\nPhysical contingency 0.9 0.2 1.1\nPrice contingency 0.3 0.2 0.5\nIDC and service charge 0.2 0.0 0.2\nTotal 10.0 2.5 12.5\nRE = Rural Electrification; SCADA = Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n65. The project cost is in 1999 prices and provides for physical contingency (10 percent of\nthe base cost) and price contingency (2.4 percent per annum for the foreign exchange cost and\n7.4 percent per annum for local currency cost). The Project will be exempted from all direct\ntaxes and duties in accordance with Government procedures for development projects.", "16\nE.  Financing Plan\n66. The financing plan envisages all foreign exchange costs to be financed by the Bank loan\nand local currency costs to be financed by the Government, as shown in Table 4.\nTable 4:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Exchange Local Currency Total Cost Percent\nBank 10.0 0.0 10.0 80\nGovernment 0.0 2.5 2.5 20\nTotal 10.0 2.5 12.5 100\n67. The proposed Bank loan of $10 million equivalent will be from the Bank\u2019s Special Funds\nresources with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years with a 1 percent per\nannum interest charge during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The\nBorrower will be the Kingdom of Bhutan.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization\n68. The Executing Agency of the Project will be DOP and after the corporatization of DOP,\nthe corporatized DOP. As has been the practice with the existing Project, all construction and\nerection work of the distribution network will be undertaken by DOP staff, supplemented by local\ncontract laborers as well as village volunteers, whose village will be electrified by the Project.\nThe existing designated Rural Electrification Project Implementation Unit of DOP will continue to\nwork on the proposed Project with a necessary increase in staff numbers. Existing available\nfacilities for the ongoing project such as computer equipment, vehicles, and warehouses will be\nused for the Project.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n69. The project manager has already been appointed, and the Project will be implemented\nover a four-year period. Bidding documents for ICB and international shopping packages have\nbeen prepared by the PPTA consultants. Procurement of equipment and materials will be\nphased into two groups to suit DOP\u2019s storage capacity and physical implementation schedule.\nPhysical implementation will commence in April 2001 and is expected to be completed by\nSeptember 2003, six months before the anticipated loan closing in March 2004. The schedule is\nconsidered realistic as logistics and the project implementation unit have been streamlined\nthrough the ongoing project. The detailed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 9.\n3.  Procurement\n70. Procurement of necessary equipment and materials for the Project will be undertaken in\naccordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, which were revised in February 1999\nreflecting the Bank\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, and mandatory use of the Bank\u2019s standard bidding\ndocuments. Since ICB contracts as originally packaged under the ongoing Project did not attract\nany bidders, the size, packaging arrangement, and timing of contracts was carefully reviewed.\nThe ICB contracts were arranged into six packages and are to be issued in the same bidding\ndocument. Bidders will have the option to bid on any or all packages, thus assuring competition.", "17\nTentative contract packages are shown in Appendix 10. Supply contracts estimated to cost the\nequivalent of  $500,000  or  less,  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping  procedures.\nPackages with an estimated contract value of more than $500,000 will be procured through ICB.\nLocal manufacturers may participate in bidding on the contract packages, and a domestic\npreference scheme may be applied in accordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nOn 5 May 1999, the Bank approved advance procurement action in the interest of efficient and\nearly  implementation of the  Project.  It  was  clarified  with  the  Government  that  the  Bank\u2019s\napproval of advance procurement action will not in any way commit the Bank to approve the\nProject subsequently or to finance the cost incurred. Experience under the existing Project has\nbeen good.\n4.  Consulting Services\n71. An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. As DOP is successfully implementing the ongoing rural\nelectrification project in addition to more than 30 previous rural electrification schemes, limited\nconsulting services will be required for project implementation. The international consultant will\nassist DOP with procurement, detailed design, construction supervision, training on the use of\nnew equipment, and monitoring of project benefits. It is estimated that about 10 person-months\nwill be required. DOP will provide sufficient counterpart staff. The terms of reference for the\nconsulting services are given in Appendix 11. On 5 May 1999, the Bank approved advance\nrecruitment action in the interest of efficient and early implementation of the Project. It was\nclarified with the Government that the Bank\u2019s approval of advance recruitment action would not\nin any way commit the Bank to approve the Project subsequently or to finance the cost incurred.\n5. Disbursement\n72. Disbursements under the Project will be mainly for the supply of goods and consulting\nservices. Therefore, the Bank\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used\nfor disbursement purposes.\n6. Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n73. Regular progress reports will be prepared for the Project and submitted to the Bank on a\nquarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  include a  description  of  physical  progress,  problems  and\ndifficulties encountered, and summary of financial accounts for the Project, which will consist of\nproject expenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. A project completion\nreport  will  be submitted  to  the  Bank  within  three  months  after  completion  of  the  Project.\nSeparate accounts will be maintained for the Project by DOP. Within the nine months of the\nclose of the financial year, detailed annual project accounts audited by an auditor acceptable to\nthe  Bank  will be  submitted.  In addition, after  corporatization of  DOP  in  FY2002,  financial\nstatements of the corporatized DOP, consisting of an income statement, balance sheet, and a\nstatement on sources and application of funds, audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank will\nbe submitted within nine months of the close of the financial year. DOP has generally been in\ncompliance with the covenants on audited financial statements.", "18\nG.  The Executing Agency\n1.  Organization of DOP\n74. The existing organization of DOP reflects its responsibility for a portion of the electric\npower assets of the Government from generation to distribution except for CHPC. Regarding\nthe Tala Hydropower Project Authority and the Kurichhu Project Authority, although they are\nseparate entities, DOP seconds its staff to them for their engineering and contractual works, as\nwell as monitoring of their physical implementation. DOP operates and maintains small power\nplants and 66 kV, 33 kV, 11 kV, and low voltage systems including service connections under\nthe direct guidance of MTI. Because DOP is part of the Government, although technical matters\nare  handled  by  DOP,  all  administrative  and  financial  matters  are  supervised  by  the\nAdministrative and Finance Division of MTI.  Overall planning of the power sector is undertaken\nby  DOP  in  consultation  with  other  concerned  ministries.  Approved  investment  plans  are\nconveyed to DOP for execution. All budgetary allocations are channeled from MOF through MTI\nto DOP. DOP collects revenues from the sale of electricity to residential consumers and remits\nthe entire amount to the Government. DOP is also governed by the Bhutan Civil Service Rules\n(1990)  on  recruitment,  pay  scales,  incentives,  promotions,  and  fringe  benefits  as  well  as\npensions and insurance.\n75. DOP is divided into two wings, O&M, and Projects and Investigations. The O&M wing\nhas  responsibility  for  the  maintenance  and  construction  of  transmission  and  distribution\nnetworks, as well as mini/microhydropower plants located in the different districts together with\ntheir associated distribution networks in electric supply units and subunits. Although the O&M\nwing does not have responsibility for the microhydropower plants that are operated by the local\ndistricts, it is providing necessary assistance for their maintenance and repair. The Projects and\nInvestigations wing is responsible for monitoring implementation of projects and assisting the\nGovernment in project negotiations. The DOP organization chart is in Appendix 12.\n76. In October 1993, the Government transferred certain assets and staff of DOP to local\ngovernment  units  to  improve  O&M  and  customer  service  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s\ndecentralization policy. This resulted in the transfer of all microhydropower generation assets to\nthe districts, which were made responsible for their O&M. In addition, the power distribution\nassets and the staff of DOP associated with the electric supply units of Gelephu and Samdrup\nJongkhar in the Eastern Region, and Samtse in the Western Region, as well as electric supply\nsubunits in Ha, were transferred to their respective districts. These districts are responsible for\nall billing and collection, and all administrative matters associated with power distribution. They\noperate as separate distribution entities receiving supply from locally installed microhydropower\nplants or from DOP through the grid.\n77. For the future corporatization of DOP, the Bank has proposed that DOP be structured as\nthe national transmission and distribution company responsible for all the transmission activities\nin and out of the country and the distribution activities within the country. With this sector\nstructure, DOP will control and plan all the power transmission and distribution activities, and at\nthe same time receive additional revenues from wheeling charges from export of power. As it\nnow stands, with major transmission and distribution investments being planned throughout the\ncountry,  DOP  will  not  be  able  to  survive  with  only  domestic  electricity  revenues.  The\nrecommended  sector  structure  will  be  further  reviewed  and  rationalized  under  the  Bank\u2019s\nongoing TA.", "19\n2.  Financial Projection of DOP\n78. As a division within the Government, DOP does not have a separate accounting system\nas all financial and administrative matters are handled and supervised by the Administrative and\nFinance Division of MTI. At present, DOP is responsible for collection of the domestic electricity\nrevenues while CHPC is in charge of all export sales. To see how its account will look as a\ncorporate  entity,  separate  from  the  Government  budgetary  system,  a  proforma  financial\nprojection of  DOP  was prepared.  The  projection  was  carried out for  1999  to 2010.  As a\ncorporate and independent entity, DOP will have to be financially self-sustainable. For this\nreason, the Bank proposed and the Government agreed to achieve by the end of FY2005, three\nyears after DOP is fully corporatized, the following financial covenants: at least a 6 percent\nnominal rate of return on net revalued fixed assets, at least a 1.5 debt service ratio, at least a\n20 percent self-financing  ratio, and  a  maximum debt-equity  ratio of 60:40.  These financial\ntargets are considered reasonable considering the relatively high inflation and savings rate in\nBhutan of about 6.5 to 7.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. A summary of DOP\u2019s financial\nprojection is provided in Table 5, and the details and assumptions are provided in Appendix 13.\nTable 5: DOP\u2019s Financial Projection\n(Nu Million)\nItem FY1999 FY2001 FY2003 FY2005 FY2007 FY2010\nDomestic Sales (GWh) 400.0 419.0 461.9 509.2 561.4 649.9\nPower Export Wheeled (GWh) 1,895.0 4,237.2 6,460.8 7,110.4\nEnergy Sources (GWh) 417.6 460.4 2,441.2 4,883.4 7,209.6 7,969.7\nSystem Losses 9.0% 9.0% 9.0% 9.0% 9.0% 9.0%\nEnergy Cost (Nu/kWh) 0.30 0.32 0.37 0.43 0.49 0.60\nAvg Domestic Tariff (Nu/kWh) 0.60 0.69 0.85 1.00 1.13 1.48\nWheeling Charges (Nu/kWh) 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14\nOperating Revenues 238.8 291.0 595.1 1,017.7 1,468.7 1,977.8\nOperating Expenses 265.8 314.7 569.9 671.7 758.0 1,278.9\nNet Operating Profit (27.0) (23.7) 25.2 346.0 710.7 699.0\nInterest Expenses 24.9 34.1 235.8 238.2 210.4 323.0\nForeign Exchange Losses - 25.0 44.8 43.3 40.7 33.9\nIncome Tax 137.9 102.6\nNet Profit (51.9) (82.8) (255.4) 64.4 321.8 239.4\nGross Fixed Assets 1,850.9 2,558.8 6,098.3 7,979.9 9,170.4 14,589.3\nDepreciation 605.0 845.3 1,284.8 1,923.6 2,634.2 4,541.2\nNet Fixed Assets 1,245.9 1,713.5 4,813.5 6,056.3 6,536.2 10,048.1\nConstruction in Progress 1,412.3 3,285.8 2,090.2 2,595.9 3,581.0 2,725.8\nTotal Assets 2,724.6 5,050.7 7,027.3 8,987.8 11,086.2 13,103.0\nLiabilities 1,081.8 2,287.9 2,990.6 3,519.8 3,548.2 3,100.7\nEquity 1,642.7 2,741.9 4,037.7 5,468.0 7,537.9 10,002.3\nRate of Return -1.8% -1.3% 0.6% 6.0% 7.7% 6.0%\nDebt Service Ratio 0.7 0.7 0.7 1.5 1.7 1.7\nSelf Financing Ratio -8% -5% -16% 23% 46% 61%\nDebt : Equity Ratio 33 : 67 46 : 54 45 : 55 45 : 55 41 : 59 34 : 66", "20\n79. Major assumptions in preparing the above financial projections include (i) DOP being\nstructured as the national  transmission  and  distribution entity for  the  country beginning  in\nFY2002, thereby allowing it to  earn  wheeling charges for the  service;  (ii)  energy  cost for\ndomestic use remaining at the present level of Nu0.30/kWh, increasing by the domestic inflation\nrate only; and (iii) assumptions on the assets level and the planned investments. The financial\nprojections show that in the next few years and during the early years of the formation of the\ncorporatized DOP, the company will experience heavy losses as it will now have to account for\nits own depreciation and financing costs, and will receive no budgetary support. However, with\nthe additional revenues from wheeling charges being earned, particularly when power supply\nfrom the Tala plant becomes available for export  in  FY2005,  DOP\u2019s financial position  will\nimprove, and it is expected that it will be able to achieve the financial targets by FY2005. At this\ntime, the overall domestic tariffs and wheeling charges should be at least about Nu1.0 and\nNu0.12 per kWh, respectively, bearing in mind that these tariff levels are based on the low\nenergy supply presumably from the Chhukha plant. If the cost of supply from the generation\ncompanies increases, DOP will need to pass the increased costs to its consumers. The explicit\ntariff level will be further determined once the registration and valuation of DOP\u2019s assets are\nfinalized in FY2001.\n80. The current tariff of Nu0.6/kWh and even the proposed rate of Nu0.7/kWh are not\nsufficient to cover DOP\u2019s costs. Based on the findings under the institutional and financial\ndevelopment TA (footnote 2), the system average transmission and distribution cost for DOP to\nsupply 1 kWh of energy in the country is approximately Nu1.30 per kWh. At present, these\nlosses are not transparent because the sector as a whole is still profitable (80 percent of the\nenergy produced in the country is exported to India at Nu1.5 per kWh, and the cost to generate\nthis energy is less than Nu0.2/kWh). However, with the plan to corporatize DOP in the future, it\nis important to ensure that DOP will be financially self-sustainable and viable. Furthermore, as\nthe Government intends to increase electrification in the rural areas, which is not commercially\noriented, the Government will have to ensure that these marginal investments do not jeopardize\nDOP\u2019s financial condition. Therefore, DOP will need to continue to obtain long-term, low-cost\nfunding for this type of investment. Given the large investments in the energy sector, the\nGovernment will need to carefully review the sector to ensure fair distribution of charges to the\nusers to recover the investments.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Measures\n81. In view of the high reliance on fuelwood as a source of energy, the Government foresees\nbenefits to accrue from the Project not only in terms of balanced development throughout the\ncountry but also in a reduction of the rate of forest depletion. The Project is expected to have a\nsignificant positive impact on the reduction of demand for fuelwood in the long term. Under the\nPPTA, as part of the feasibility study for the Project, an initial environmental examination was\nprepared and a summary is presented in Appendix 14. The Project is classified as category B,\nand a detailed environmental impact assessment is not necessary.\n82. As part of project feasibility, an intensive field survey was undertaken for distribution line\nrouting. Most of the distribution poles will run along the roadside and transformers will be pole-\nmounted. Apart from minor bush clearing along the road, no deforestation will take place. Based\non the survey, the Project will have no impact on any rare or endangered flora and fauna\nspecies or habitat. There will be no discharge of polluting materials, given the nature of the\nProject. There are very few cultural features that fall within the project area, such as temples or", "21\nmonasteries. With proper planning of the route, none of the cultural features will be disturbed\nother than by the minor visual appearance of distribution lines. Because most erection works\nare associated with poles, soil erosion and silt runoff will be insignificant. The construction\nactivities of the Project will not have any significant impact on ecology.\n2.  Social Measures\na.  Targetting the Poor\n83. The Project, which targets the poorer areas of Bhutan, is the first of its kind in the Bank\nwhere the primary objective of poverty reduction is met by providing electricity to more than two\nthirds of project beneficiaries who live below the poverty line. It will improve the overall quality of\nlife  of  rural  people  and  reduce  poverty  by  improving  access  to  economic  and  social\nopportunities,  including  employment, schools,  health  services, and other  social as  well as\ngovernment services. Women and children will benefit from the Project through a reduction of\nthe incidence of respiratory diseases and of women\u2019s daily chores of collecting fuel, which will\nrelease their time and energy for more productive and socially beneficial activities. Construction\nworks under the Project will require mostly unskilled labor and will generate direct income-\nearning opportunities, particularly for the poor. It is estimated the Project will provide 115,000\nperson-days of unskilled employment opportunities over a period of three and one half years.\nDuring  the  implementation  phase,  DOP  will  make  the  service  connections  to  the  poor\nhouseholds a priority. The poor households will be identified by DOP through consultations with\ncommunity representatives, village leaders, and district administrations.\nb.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n84. The Project will require minimal land acquisition for the erection of transformers and\npoles. There will be no involuntary population resettlement. As agreed with the Government,\nattention will be given to establishing firm commitments for financing land acquisition well in\nadvance of construction to ensure that delays in construction works do not occur. Compensation\nin cash will be provided by the Government to the owners for crops and trees located in the\nright-of-way of the erected poles. Bhutan has some ethnic minority groups such as Doya, Laya\nLingzi, Merak Sektang, and Yak herders, who constitute less than 0.2 percent of the total\npopulation. Since the minority people live in areas that will not be covered by the Project, a\nminority people development plan is not required. Land acquisition was satisfactorily carried out\nfor ongoing project without any disputes.\nc. Participatory Project Performance Monitoring System\n85. A project performance monitoring system will be set up under the Project in association\nwith DOP. Regular feedback will be provided by the project implementation units to the Bank\nregarding the effectiveness of the Project and any necessary changes that may be required\nduring implementation. Regular monitoring reports will be included in quarterly reports prepared\nby DOP.\n86. DOP will monitor the project benefits to enable postevaluation of the Project, and also to\nimprove the planning of future rural electrification projects. The proposed project performance\nevaluation  and  measurement  indicators  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Project Performance Management System. DOP will establish, in consultation\nwith the Bank, a set of performance indicators and performance targets to monitor project\nbenefits at the time of loan inception.", "22\n87. The Bank expects to carry out a power sector review in 2002. As part of the review,\nconsultants will conduct comprehensive social impact monitoring and evaluation before and\nafter completion of the Project to determine (i) the total number of connected consumers in\nvarious categories, number of total potential consumers in those categories resident in the\nservice  area,  and  the  connection  ratios  for  those  categories  at  various  dates  after\ncommissioning; (ii) average consumption rates for consumers in each category; (iii) description\nof new economic activities induced by the introduction of electricity; (iv) description of existing\neconomic activities that have switched to using electricity and thereby become more efficient\nand  productive;  (v)  estimated  total  value  of  economic  activities  induced  by  the  rural\nelectrification;  (vi)  estimate  of  average  income  levels;  and  (vii) survey  of  the  perceived\nimportance  of  various  types  of  benefits  created  by  rural  electrification,  such  as  improved\nemployment  opportunities,  increased  income  levels,  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure\nactivities, and improved health standards. It will also carry out concurrent surveys of average\nincome levels in some representative and comparable communities that are not electrified to\ndetermine  the  incremental  impact  of  rural  electrification  on  income  levels  and  economic\nactivities. In addition, the consultants will conduct monitoring and evaluation of land acquisition\nactivities,  entitlements, time frames, and budget  set  out for  this  process.  A  social  impact\nanalysis of the Project is presented in Appendix 15.\nI.  Governance\n88. The Bank\u2019s operations in Bhutan are clearly addressing improvement of governance of\nthe power sector of Bhutan as well as of DOP. For the governance of the overall power sector,\nthe Bank is providing assistance for the policy and legal framework of the power sector, through\nwhich  utility  operation  will  be  clearly  segregated  from  policy  making  and  regulation,  and\nespecially transparency and accountability of the tariff setting will be established. In addition, the\nBank is assisting DOP to implement a commercial accounting system through its TAs for the\ntransparent  costing,  efficient  and  sustainable  operation  of  DOP,  along  with  institutional\nstrengthening in the technical fields. It will also enhance the corporate governance of DOP.\nFurthermore, the proposed Project was formulated following the participatory approach from the\nplanning stage to the feasibility study stage. Such a participatory approach will also be followed\nduring implementation.\nJ.  Technical Assistance\n89. To assist DOP\u2019s transition from a Government division to a corporation, an advisory TA\naccompanying the present loan will be provided to the Government for the Corporatization of\nDOP. The major works will include (i) conducting asset registration and valuation of DOP by\nqualified international asset appraisers; (ii) formulating a recommendation on asset and liability\nand  equity  structures  and  other  financial  arrangement  to  ensure  financial  viability  of  the\ncorporatized DOP; (iii) establishing tariff adjustment based on the long-run marginal costs and\non  the  financial  projection  of  the  corporatized  DOP;  (iv)  facilitating  registration  of  the\ncorporatized  DOP  including  preparation  of  necessary  documents  as  a  company  such  as\nmemorandum and articles of association as per the power sector legislation and companies act;\n(v) formulating the organizational structure of the corporatized DOP, such as delegation of\npowers,  job  description,  necessary  human  resources,  salary  and  fringe  benefit  structure,\nrecruiting policy, etc.; (vi) finalizing a human resource development program, which is necessary\nfor the corporatization of DOP in association with other aid agencies and in consultation with the\nBank;  and  (vii) providing  the  necessary  training  on  commercial  accounting,  corporate  and\nfinancial management, and tariff setting methodology to DOP\u2019s staff by using training courses\navailable at the Royal Institute of Management as a subcontractor to the selected consulting", "23\nfirm.  About  20  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  necessary.  The\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will\nbe financed by  the  Bank  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan. Terms of reference and cost estimates are indicated in Appendix 16.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Evaluation\n1.  Load Forecast\n90. The  PPTA  household  survey  results  from  nonelectrified  and  electrified  households\nindicate that the preparedness of consumers and their willingness to pay for electricity is high.\nThe  response from  the non-electrified  consumers  as  to  the  level of  monthly bill  they  are\nprepared to pay (average of Nu200 per month from purely domestic consumers) suggests both\nthe willingness to pay a higher tariff and relatively high consumption levels for rural areas.16 The\naverage consumption by the project beneficiaries is expected to range from 80 to 120 kWh per\nmonth  as  most  of  the  beneficiaries  will  fall  under  the  lifeline  consumption.17  Most  of  the\ncommercial  activity  in  the  villages  is  restricted  to  house-and-shop  residences.  The\nvillage industries,  mainly comprising small rice, flour, and saw mills, are  expected to  convert to\nelectricity (motor-driven), from their diesel-driven systems. Considering the domestic market and\nthe current status of commercial activities in the rural areas, modest growth for such industries\nis expected.\n91. The load forecast for domestic consumers in rural areas considers an overall growth of\n3 percent per annum, commensurate with the population growth (2.4 percent) for the next\n10 years. Beyond this period, the forecasted load was assumed to remain constant. Potential for\nhigher consumption still exists, if proper and strict steps are taken to prevent excessive use of\nfirewood for room heating, thereby conserving forest resources.\n2.  Ability and Willingness to Pay\n92. The survey results have indicated the consumers\u2019 willingness and ability to pay. The\namount spent on fuel in nonelectrified villages and on electricity in electrified villages is very low\ncompared with the total expenditure or income. The willingness to pay can also be gauged from\nthe response of the surveyed households, with most (95 percent) respondents indicating their\nwillingness to pay according to the billed amount. The survey also indicated that the villagers\nare keen to have electricity and are ready to pay for the initial cost of house wiring and the initial\ndeposit.\n                                                       \n16\nThe figure may be due more to their eagerness to obtain electricity, rather than the actual payment that they are\ngoing to spend, as the survey also showed that the consumption level of the poor households in rural areas is\nusually quite low.\n17\nAs recommended under the Bank\u2019s TA for institutional and financial development (footnote 2), completed in March\n1997, a lifeline consumption block is set at 80 kWh per month, a middle block up to 200 kWh per month, and a third\nblock over 200 kWh per month.", "24\n3.  Least-Cost Alternative\n93. The Project represents the least-cost solution for supplying electricity to the project\nareas in a reliable manner to meet the expected demand. It includes a combination of grid-fed\nservices and some isolated community-based solar systems.18 The source of supply for the\nschemes  is  mainly  indigenous  hydropower.  Power  from  these  sources  will  be  brought  to\nconsumers  through  extensions  of  the  existing  transmission  and  distribution  network.  The\nalternative with diesel power generation for the project areas is not considered viable, due to the\ndifficulty with transportation in certain terrain, and the fact that the fuel cost and O&M cost for\nthe diesel alternative would be costlier compared with the network extensions. Further, the\nproposed transmission and distribution extensions enable future expansion and can fit in the\noverall master plan for rural electrification. Some centers of local communities can not be\nelectrified by the network expansion, although they comprise schools, hospitals, and other\npublic facilities. For such local centers, electrification by solar panels or mini/microhydropower is\napplicable. Under the proposed Project, solar panels will be applied to three local community\ncenters as the least-cost alternative.\n4.  Economic and Financial Analysis\n94. Benefits of the proposed Project have been estimated in terms of nonincremental and\nincremental benefits based on Bank guidelines. For residential and nonindustrial consumers,\ntheir nonincremental benefit is estimated by resource cost savings (about 80 percent of total\nload forecast), i.e., cost savings from the substitution of kerosene by electricity for lighting, and\nthe incremental benefit for the new market (representing about 20 percent of load forecast) by\nwillingness to pay, i.e., the benefit of increased consumption because of the availability of lower\ncost electricity. For the industrial/commercial consumers, or those motive power users, their\nwillingness to pay is estimated by the cost (capital and O&M cost) of self-generation from a\ncaptive diesel plant. The Project will start accruing benefits progressively from FY2001 as the\n16 districts in the rural areas are being electrified, and the full benefits will be in FY2003. The\nproject economic internal rate of return based on this approach was calculated to be about\n13 percent, as compared with the 10 percent discount rate for Bhutan. Further details of this\nanalysis are given in Appendix 17. The sensitivity analysis shows that despite the high capital\ncost, the relatively low electricity consumption  and the  large gap between the  export  and\ndomestic tariff, the Project remains economically viable. There would have to be more than a\n14 percent  increase  in  cost  for  the  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  fall  below\n10 percent. Similarly, there has to be at least a 12 percent decline in benefits for the net present\nvalue to fall to zero. This provides sufficient cushion to guard against any fluctuation in the\neconomic growth  rate. Without the  Project,  the  alternative  would  be  to  maintain  the  high\nkerosene and diesel oil consumption, all of which are imported from India, and in the longer\nterm, the use of fuelwood. The nonquantifiable benefits of the Project are (i) improvement of the\nlivelihood of the people in the rural area, (ii) provision of opportunities for cash-generating\nbusiness, and thus promoting economic development, (iii) reduction of the use of fuelwood in\nthe long term, which is hazardous to the health of the people, (iv) decrease in the pressure of\ndeforestation,  and  (v) assistance  to  improve  functioning  of  social  and  public  infrastructure\nfacilities such as hospitals and schools.\n95. Given the nature of the Project, which caters mainly to poor rural consumers, the Project\nis financially marginal (financial rate of return is negative) as its investment cost is not fully\ncompensated by the financial gain from the output. The tariff in the rural areas is also expected\n                                                       \n18\nThe least-cost analysis is further complemented by the proposed UNDP/GEF-assisted mini/micro hydropower\nplants to remote villages.", "25\nto rise more slowly than urban and industrial tariffs. The Project largely represents the social\nobligation of the Government to its people. Therefore, the Government has to make sure that it\nwill not adversely affect DOP\u2019s financial performance, especially once DOP is corporatized and\nbecomes an independent entity. In this case, the Government agreed to ensure that DOP would\nachieve the financial targets (minimum 6 percent rate of return on net fixed assets, debt service\nratio of 1.5, and self-financing ratio of 20 percent) through necessary tariff adjustments. DOP\nonce corporatized will be able to meet these financial targets from FY2005 onward.\nB.  Environmental and Social Dimensions\n1. Environmental Dimension\n96. The  Government  is  addressing  environmental  concerns  and  maintaining  strict\nregulations to preserve a minimum 60 percent of the forest covering the total land area. In view\nof the high reliance on fuelwood as a source of energy in households, the Government foresees\nbenefits to accrue from the Project not only in terms of balanced development throughout the\ncountry but also in a reduction of the pressure of deforestation in the long term. Fuelwood\nconsumption  in  rural  areas  will  be gradually  replaced  by  electricity,  which  is  indigenously\ngenerated from hydropower stations.\n2. Social Dimension\n97. The surveys conducted under the PPTA were undertaken using a participatory approach\nand included a socioeconomic survey of over 466 households in electrified and nonelectrified\nvillages.  During fact-finding, full  consultations  with  stakeholders  were  carried  out  involving\ncommunities, particularly the rural poor. Several meetings were held in the project areas with\nnongovernment organizations, community-based organizations, and members of civil society\norganizations. A social impact assessment was carried out and a summary is included in\nAppendix 15.\n98. Provision of electricity under this Project will directly improve the quality of life for 5,437\nrural households. The immediate tangible economic benefit is reducing expenditure on imported\nkerosene and to a smaller extent the use of fuelwood. It has been estimated that a 10 percent\nimmediate decrease in fuelwood consumption will be achieved as a result of the Project. The\nProject also provides electricity to public facilities such as health centers, schools, and other\npublic facilities for local communities. Therefore, the Project will increase the overall level of\neconomic and social well-being of Bhutan\u2019s rural population.\n99. Rural electrification will especially improve the living conditions of women and children.\nElectrification reduces the incidence of respiratory diseases among women and children as they\nusually stay in the house longer than do men. The Project, for instance, will benefit women\nsubstantially by reducing women\u2019s daily chore of collecting fuelwood. Reducing women\u2019s burden\nof collecting fuelwood would release their time and energy for more productive and socially\nbeneficial activities. In addition, electrification of ricemills and other grain mills as well as food\nprocessing facilities also reduces women\u2019s workload.\n100. In  addition  to  direct  enhancement  of  household  welfare,  policy  objectives  of  rural\nelectrification emphasize social impacts of the overall benefit to the community. The use of\nelectricity by community services and positive impacts on reduction of population growth, rural-\nurban migration, and modern lifestyle are usually expected to be substantial. Rural electrification\nwill be used by rural schools, and health clinics, and for street lighting and public buildings. The", "26\nfact that there  is a  wider  range  of  goods and  services available  is  also a  benefit  to  the\ncommunity. Less tangibly, the availability of electricity tends to provide rural communities with a\npsychological  boost  as  it  brings  them  into  active  contact  with  national  and  international\nperspectives (radio, television, Internet, etc.), thus improving the moral and civic pride of rural\npeople.\n3. Impact on Poverty\n101. The overall strategy of the Project for poverty reduction has been formulated in terms of\ntwo approaches: targeted interventions to meet the basic electricity needs of the poor and\nbroadly based economic growth to generate income-earning opportunities for the poor. The\nProject is expected to reduce rural poverty and raise living standards of rural communities\nthrough increased access to electricity.  The specific objectives are to (i) provide opportunity for\nincome-generating activities, (ii) generate employment through expansion of cottage and small\nindustries to mitigate rural poverty, (iii) improve the quality of rural life, and (iv) provide adequate\nand quality education and health services to rural people, particularly the poor and vulnerable\ngroups through the supply of hydropower-generated electricity from existing local power stations\nand solar panels.\n102. Approximately 6,038 customers in rural villages in 16 districts will be provided with\naccess to electricity. The poverty profile of the population affected by the Project is such, that\n4,217 households19 or more than two thirds (69.8 percent) of the Project\u2019s beneficiaries live\nbelow the estimated poverty line level of Bhutan.20 During the implementation phase, DOP will\nprovide the service connection to poor households as a first priority. Poor households will be\nidentified by DOP through consultations with community representatives, village leaders, and\ndistrict administrations. In addition, construction of transmission lines, which mostly require\nunskilled labor, will generate direct income-earning opportunities, particularly for the poor. Over\nthree  and  one-half  years,  the  Project  will  provide  approximately  115,000  person-days  of\nunskilled employment opportunities, particularly for the poor.\n103. The availability of electricity will become a stimulant to the creation of new rural industry\nand commerce. In Bhutan, agricultural processing is the main direct industrial productive use of\nelectricity in rural areas, e.g., grain grinding, flour milling, rice husking, and production of seed\noil. The productive use of electricity will increase employment opportunities and reduce rural to\nurban  migration.  Furthermore,  the  supply  of  electricity to  the  lower  income  households  is\nexpected to enhance their income-earning potential, as weaving and other cottage industry\nactivities can continue at night.\nC.  Risks\n1.  Macroeconomic Risks\n104. At the macroeconomic level, slower economic growth could result in growth of electricity\nsales lower than the assumed level. This would result in the project investment taking a longer\ntime  to  realize full  benefits,  thereby adversely affecting the  project  returns.  The  projected\n3 percent increase of demand is sufficiently lower than the actual increase of 5 percent of the\n                                                       \n19 Based on the PPTA report, the average number of household members is eight.\n20 Since no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment has been based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily on food intake of 2,400 calories per person per day) as that followed in India, adjusted to\nconsider nuances relevant to Bhutan, such as expenditure on transport, shelter, clothing, fuel, etc. This is\nestimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price level).", "27\nload growth in the last five years. Thus, the probability  of  even  lower  load  growth  is  not\nconsidered high.\n105. The  risk  from  lower  than  assumed  tariffs  could  be  significant  for  DOP\u2019s  viability.\nHowever, the Government already provided assurances to ensure that DOP will be financially\nsustainable,  and  that  it  will  achieve  the  financial  covenants  through  gradual  overall  tariff\nadjustment and  introduction of the  three-block tariff to  low  voltage  customers  prior  to  the\ncorporatization of DOP. Therefore, the average tariff for low voltage customers will be higher\nthan the overall tariff assumed for the evaluation of the Project. In this context, the probability of\ntariff increases falling significantly lower than the assumed increases is considered low. In\naddition, the Government will allow DOP to receive additional revenues from wheeling power to\nIndia.\n106. As a major portion of the Project\u2019s investment is in foreign currency, it is sensitive to the\nngultrum devaluation. Drastic devaluation of the local currency is unlikely to happen as the\nngultrum is tied to the Indian rupee. This issue will be addressed as part of the ongoing dialogue\non tariff structure and the scheduled private sector participation TA.\n2.  Institutional and Project Risks\n107. The Government is required to provide financing for 20 percent of the project cost from\nits budget. The risk of shortfall in this is low considering the current prudent Government policy\nfor the budget. In addition, the power sector is a revenue-earning sector for the Government and\nthe Project is provided priority because of its socioeconomic impact. The risk of institutional\ncapability not being adequate to construct and operate the Project is minimal because of DOP\u2019s\nconsiderable experience with similar projects and the track record of the ongoing project funded\nby the Bank. Through the ongoing project, DOP\u2019s technical and institutional capability as the\nproject executing agency was substantially strengthened.\n108. Technical, environmental, and social risks are minimal. Implementation risks do exist\ndue to the geographic difficulties. However, through the ongoing rural electrification project,\nDOP has enough managerial capability to execute the proposed Project as DOP has acquired\nsufficient logistic capability to cover all districts of Bhutan. In addition, advance procurement\naction will provide DOP with the benefit of continuity. There will be a foreign exchange risk for\nDOP after the planned corporatization. Therefore, higher debt service requirements and tariff\nadjustment to foreign currency fluctuation are covenanted.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n109. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which has been incorporated in the legal documents:\na.  Corporatization of DOP\nThe new legislation for the power sector will change DOP into a commercial\ncorporation based on the recommendations of the two Bank TAs, Policy and\nLegal Framework for Power Sector Development and Corporatization of DOP in\nconsultation with the Bank, and will be ratified by the end of FY2002.", "28\nb.  Administrative\n(i)  The Government and DOP will provide sufficient human resources to\nundertake the corporatization of DOP in consultation with the Bank.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure that DOP will have the number of personnel\nto operate and maintain the corporatized DOP efficiently and effectively\nbased on the findings of the Corporatization TA.\nc.  Tariff Adjustment\n(i)  The  Government,  on  1  January  2000,  will  increase  the  urban  and\nindustrial  domestic  tariffs  to  Nu0.70  per  kWh  and  on  or  prior  to\n1 July 2001 will further increase the urban and industrial domestic tariffs\nto Nu0.80 per kWh.\n(ii)  In accordance with the recommendation of the tariff study of the Bank TA\n(TA BHU 2400), the Government will implement a two-part tariff for the\ntransmission level and primary distribution level voltage consumers, and a\nthree-block tariff for the secondary voltage consumers by end of FY2001.\n(iii)  Following the corporatization of DOP, the Government will permit DOP to\nshare export earnings from the sale of electricity to India by levying a\nwheeling  charge  for  transmitting  bulk  power  through  the  DOP\u2019s\ntransmission system. The wheeling charge with revenue from domestic\ntariffs will together be sufficient to ensure that the newly corporatized\nDOP maintains the covenanted financial ratios starting from FY2005. The\nwheeling charge and the rate of increase of domestic tariffs to enable the\ncorporatized DOP to meet the agreed financial ratios will be accurately\ndetermined through the two Bank TAs, Policy and Legal Framework for\nPower Sector Development and Corporatization of DOP, in consultation\nwith  the  Bank.  Should  the  findings  of  the  two  TAs  require  further\nadjustment of the tariff and wheeling charge, the Government/DOP will\nimplement them.\nd.  Financial\n(i)  Through  the  new  legislation  of  the  power  sector,  a  transparent\nadministrative tariff adjustment scheme will be implemented, such as a\ntariff adjustment to foreign currency fluctuation and domestic  inflation\nprior to the corporatization of DOP.\n(ii)  Upon the corporatization of DOP, the Government will provide adequate\nasset, equity, and liability structures with a maximum debt-equity ratio of\n60:40, and other financial arrangements to maintain financial viability of\nthe corporatized DOP.\n(iii)  Starting from FY2005, the corporatized DOP will maintain a rate of return\nof at least 6 percent of the net revalued fixed assets, debt service ratio of\nat least 1.5, and self-financing ratio of at least 20 percent.\n(iv)  Separate accounts will be maintained for the Project by DOP. Within the\nnine months of the close of the financial year, DOP will submit to the\nBank detailed annual project accounts audited by an auditor acceptable\nto the Bank.", "29\n(v)  The corporatized DOP will submit to the Bank its financial statements,\nconsisting of an income statement, balance sheet, and a statement on\nsources and application of funds, audited by an auditor acceptable to the\nBank within nine months of the close of each financial year.\ne. Project Implementation\n(i)  DOP, and after the corporatization of DOP, the corporatized DOP will be\nthe  Executing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  implementing,\nmonitoring, and coordinating all project activities.\n(ii)  The Government and DOP will make adequate budgetary allocations for\nthe Project for each related fiscal year to ensure timely and effective\nproject implementation.\n(iii)  DOP will maintain a project implementation unit in its O&M wing to ensure\ntimely implementation of the Project, and to liaise with the Bank and\nconsultants during implementation of the Project. The unit will be headed\nby a senior engineer or its equivalent, be staffed with adequate technical\nand administrative personnel, and be provided with adequate support\nfacilities.\n(iv)  The Government and DOP will take all necessary actions to ensure that\nall lands, rights-of-way, and other rights in land or privileges required for\nthe Project are made available on a timely basis. The Government will\noffer adequate cash compensation or suitable alternative land sites to\nlandowners affected by the land acquisition.\n(v)  DOP will monitor project implementation with benchmark information to\nbe agreed upon with the Bank. During the implementation period, DOP\nwill furnish the Bank with a quarterly report including a description of\nphysical progress, problems and difficulties encountered, and summary of\na  financial  accounts  for  the  project,  which  will  consist  of  project\nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. DOP will\nsubmit a Project completion report to the Bank within three months after\ncompletion of the Project.\nf.  Environmental and Social Measures\n(i)  DOP will ensure that all environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and\nstandards  are  complied  with  during  the  project  construction  and\noperational stages. DOP will ensure that adverse environmental impacts\nrelated to the construction and operation of the Project are minimized\nthrough  implementation of the  environmental  monitoring  program  and\nmitigation measures as specified in the initial environmental examination\nprepared for the Project, and as agreed with the Bank.\n(ii)  DOP will perform the social and environmental monitoring activities. The\nresult of the monitoring and mitigation measures will be reported to the\nBank through the quarterly reports on Project implementation and an\nevaluation report after project completion.\n(iii)  The Government  will provide adequate funds  in  a  timely  manner  for\nimplementation of such mitigation measures as necessary.", "30\n(iv)  During the implementation phase, DOP will make the service connections\nto the poor households a priority. The poor households will be identified\nby DOP during implementation, through consultations  with  community\nrepresentatives, village leaders, and district administrations.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectivity\n110. The Government has agreed to undertake the following actions prior to loan effectivity.\nCreate a group in MTI that will act as a steering committee for the TA, Corporatization of\nDOP. The group will comprise at least four dedicated officers, one project manager, one\nfinancial specialist, one administrative officer, and one engineer at the initial stage.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n111.

Rural Electrification by Distribution System\n1. Approximately 6,010 new consumers primarily in the rural districts will receive electricity\nby expanding the existing distribution networks. The components have the following physical\nfeatures:\n(i)  civil works and installation of 182 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of single circuit and\n65 cct-km of spur 33 kilovolt (kV) overhead lines;\n(ii)  civil works and installation of 33 kV pole-mounted load break switches and auto-\nreclosers;\n(iii)  installation of 30 cct-km of single circuit and 113 cct-km of spur 11 kV overhead\nlines plus replacement of 24 km of existing 11 kV conductors;\n(iv)  installation of 11 kV load break switches and auto-reclosers;\n(v)  installation  of  6,103  kVA  of  33  kV  and  3,823  kVA  of  11  kV  pole-mounted\ndistribution transformers; and\n(vi)  installation of 354 km of low voltage (LV) bundled conductor.\n2. Districts to be electrified in the western Bhutan are Chhukha, Dagana, Paro, Punakha,\nSamste,  Thimphu, and Wangdue.  The  substations at Lobesa  (for  Punakha and Wangdue\ndistricts),  Olathang  (for  Paro  district),  Jemina,  Dechhencholing,  and  Olakha  (for  Thimphu\ndistrict), and Gedu (for Chhukha district) will feed the project areas through 33 kV and 11 kV\ndistribution  network extensions.  All  these  substations  receive  power  through  the  Chhukha\ngrid system. For Dagana district, as the only available power source is Dara Chhu mini hydro\n(2 x 100, 200 kW), the electrification plans under the Project for this area are constrained by its\navailability. When Basochhu hydro project is commissioned, 66 kV line extensions to these\nareas are planned subject to available funds, and further electrification in this district will be\nundertaken in future.\n3. Districts to be electrified in central Bhutan include Bumthang, Sarpang, and Trongsa.\nMini/Micro hydro stations, Chhume (for Bhumtang), and Tangsibji (for Trongsa) are available\npower sources for the Project. Network expansion for these areas has also been restricted by\nthese power sources. Transmission network expansion plans for Tsirang from Basochhu grid\nextension and for Zhemgang through Kurichhu are under consideration by the Division of Power\n(DOP). Gelephu substation is planned as the main power source for Sarpang district.\n4. Districts to be electrified in the eastern Bhutan are Lhuentse, Mongar, Pemagatshel,\nTrashigang, and Yangtse. The available power sources under the Project for the eastern region\nare  mainly  mini hydro  plants  (i.e.  Khaling  mini hydro  plant  for  Pemagatshel,  Khalanzi  for\nMongar,  Gangzur  for  Lhuentse  and  Ranjung,  and  Chenari  for  Trashigang  and  Yangtse).\nKurichhu hydropower plant will result in future grid expansion  in these  districts for further\nexpansion.", "Appendix 7, page 2\nPart B.  Rural Electrification by Solar Panels\n5. These  systems  intend  to  electrify  schools,  hospitals,  monasteries,  and  community\nactivities. Each unit comprises two solar panels (55 W peak), 12 V battery of 125 ampere-hours\n(AH) capacity, charge controller, and four 11 W lights. Local community centers in Lhuentse\ndistrict (Dungkhar), Dagana district (Dujjaygaon), and Tsirang district have been identified as\nthe candidate sites. The total number of consumers using solar panels will be 28.\nPart C.  Small-Scale Pilot SCADA System\n6. This component is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system within\nThimphu City as the pilot system. The system includes monitoring Thimphu hydro station, a\ndiesel station, and Dechhencholing, Motithang, and Olakha substations in Thimphu using power\nline carrier.

The financial projections for the Division of Power (DOP) have been prepared to see\nhow its accounts will look as a corporate entity, separate from the Government budgetary\nsystem. As an independent entity, DOP will have its own assets and be responsible for its\nassociated liabilities. The Bank consultant under TA 2400-BHU1 estimated the value of assets,\nthat are under the responsibility of DOP. The value of these assets (mainly transmission and\ndistribution assets) as of FY1996 is used as the basis for DOP\u2019s financial projections. Additional\nassets during the period under review are based on DOP\u2019s firm investments during the Eighth\nFive-Year Plan (1998-2002) and planned investments up to FY2010. Included in the investment\nplans for the Eighth Plan are the Bank-financed first Rural Electrification Project (RE1) and the\nproposed Project. DOP is assumed to continue to purchase power from Chhukha Hydropower\nCorporation (CHPC) for the domestic market.\nB.  Major Assumptions\n2. Major assumptions for DOP\u2019s financial projections include the following.\n(i)  The pro forma projected financial statements of DOP were prepared for the fiscal\nperiod 1999 to 2010 and are in current terms. DOP's fiscal year ends on 30 June.\n(ii)  The domestic inflation rates are assumed at 7.8 percent in FY1999, 7.6 percent\nin FY2000, 7.4 percent in FY2001, and 7.2 percent from FY2002 onward, in line\nwith  the  Bank\u2019s  Project  Administration  Instructions  (PAI).  The  international\ninflation rate is assumed at 2.4 percent per annum during the period of analysis.\n(iii)  The exchange rate used is Nu42.5 to $1.00 for 1999 adjusted during the forecast\nperiod based on the differential between the assumed domestic and international\ninflation rates.\n(iv)  Operating revenues will be derived mainly from sales of domestic electricity and\nwheeling charges from transmitting the bulk power to the Indian grid, and are\nprojected based on load forecasts and the assumed tariff rates and wheeling\ncharges per kWh. The domestic load forecast in FY1999/2000 is estimated at\n400 GWh, and for the subsequent years, the overall load forecast is assumed to\ngrow  conservatively  by  5 percent  per  annum  as  no  major  investments  are\nexpected to take place during the period under review.2 The three generation\nplants, Basochhu, Kurichhu, and Tala will come into production starting from\nFY2002 for Basochhu and Kurichhu, and from FY2005 for Tala. With these\nplants, the total generation capacity of Bhutan will be about 1,500 megawatt\n(MW). Excess supply will be exported to India. In line with this, the wheeling\ncharges will be realized only after DOP is corporatized in FY2002, and when all\nthe transmission assets of CHPC are transferred to DOP.\n                                                       \n1 TA 2400-BHU:  Institutional and Financial Development of DOP, for $400,000, approved on 30 September 1995.\n2  The average annual growth during FY1992 to FY1997 was about 17 percent , however, this was mainly due to the\ncommissioning of Bhutan Ferro Alloys Limited (a ferro silicon manufacturer).", "Appendix 13, page 2\n(v)  The domestic tariff assumes the new rate proposed at Nu0.7 per kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) for urban/industrial consumers; it will be effective starting from 1 January\n2000. As agreed by the Government, this rate will increase to Nu0.8 per kWh\nstarting from 1 July 2001. The tariff for rural consumers will remain at the current\nlevel of Nu0.5 per kWh up to the end of FY2000 and rise slowly at half of the\ndomestic inflation rate. To achieve the financial targets by FY2005, the overall\naverage domestic tariff during this period will have to be increased to about\nNu1.0 per kWh. The nominal wheeling charge is assumed at Nu0.10 per kWh for\nFY2002, this takes into consideration the current wheeling charges paid by the\nGovernment of Bhutan in using the Indian grid, i.e., ranging from Nu0.05 to\nNu0.20 per kWh depending on the voltage level. Based on current assumptions,\nthe wheeling charge will also need to reach at least Nu0.12/kWh to achieve the\nfinancial targets by FY2005. Beyond this time, the annual average tariff and\nwheeling charge were determined at a level sufficient to fulfill the Bank\u2019s financial\ncovenants.\n(vi)  Operating expenses consist of (i) power purchase, which comes mainly from\nCHPC,  (ii) operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  incurred  by  DOP,  and\n(iii) depreciation of existing and newly acquired assets. Cost of power, currently\nat Nu0.30 per kWh, will increase in line with domestic inflation. The current O&M\ncost incurred by DOP is approximately 3 percent of its total historical capital\ncosts. Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated on a straight-line basis with\naverage life for transmission and distribution assets of about 25 years.\n(vii)  In accordance to the prevailing tax rate, DOP will pay income or corporate taxes\nof 30 percent per annum on the net operating income after interest payment.\nDOP will be allowed to carry its losses for future tax payments.\n(viii)  Overall  system  losses for domestic  consumption  are  assumed  at  9  percent\nbased on the average historical losses in the past 5 years.\n(ix)  As of FY1996, the total gross assets under DOP were estimated at Nu1,469\nmillion with some adjustments made to bring them to their current value, and\nbased on the usage life of these assets,  the accumulated  depreciation  was\nderived. During the fiscal period 1996 to 1999, additional capital expenditure was\nincurred such as rehabilitation of the mini and micro hydels, improvement and\nupgradation of rural and urban transmission and distribution systems, including\nthe Bank\u2019s RE1 project. For the purpose of this projection, it is assumed that the\nGovernment will be responsible for the overall budgetary allocation on the RE1\nproject, and only when it is completed and commissioned that the assets and\ntheir associated liabilities are transferred to DOP. The cost of the RE1 project is\nabout $9.5 million. For the proposed Project, which will commence in 2000 at an\nestimated cost of $12.5 million, it is assumed that the capital expenditure will\nalready be reflected on DOP's account.\n(x)  The existing assets of Nu1,469 million are assumed to have a 40:60 debt to\nequity ratio based on the historical pattern of capital investment made in the\npower sector in Bhutan. The existing loan was assumed to carry a soft term of\n10 percent annual interest rate and 15 year repayment period. This is in line with", "Appendix 13, page 3\nthe current financing  terms  in the  power  sector  in  Bhutan3  although  regular\ncommercial loans are at about 16 percent per annum. For the two Bank projects,\nthe Government will onlend the loans it receives from the Bank, and the balance\nis treated as a grant from the Government to DOP. The Bank loans are $7.5 and\n$10  million  equivalent,  respectively.  The  interest  rates  charged  by  the\nGovernment to DOP on these foreign loans are assumed at their actual rates,\nand all will have a repayment period of 15 years.4 Interest and principal payments\nof these loans will start at the commissioning of these projects. DOP will bear the\nforeign exchange risks associated with these foreign currency loans.5\n(xi)  Construction-in-progress during FY2000-FY2010 reflect the investment plans of\nDOP. The estimate given by DOP on its investments in the next 10 years amount\nto about Nu10.0 billion, this excludes the two Bank projects. These substantial\ninvestments  include  all  the  bulk  and  nonbulk  transmission  and  distribution\nprojects and several mini and micro-hydels. It is understood that the Government\nof Bhutan has received commitment, mainly from the Government of India to\nfinance 65.1 percent of these investments on a grant basis. About 4.4 percent of\ntotal  investments  will  be  financed  by  loans  (for  the  Kurichhu  and  Tala\ntransmission projects), and the balance, about 30.5 percent will be funded by a\ncombination of additional grants and own financing. For  the purpose of  this\nprojection, for those investments to be implemented during the Eighth and Ninth\nfive-year plans, it was assumed that 60 percent would be financed by grants and\n40 percent by loans. At the end of these periods, DOP should be able to stand on\nits own to finance its future investments without getting further grants. DOP will\npay about a 12 to 14 percent interest rate on the loans, which is higher than the\nloan, charged by the Government of India of about 9 to 10.75 percent per annum.\nAll of these  loans are assumed to have a  repayment  period of 10 years with a\n5-year grace period.\n(xii)  Gross fixed assets are revalued annually according to the domestic inflation\nrates. The calculation for the financial covenant, rate of return on revalued net\nfixed assets, is based on a three-year rolling average.\n(xiii)  Accounts receivable were assumed at 45 days of total revenues, inventory at\n30 days of O&M costs, and accounts payable at 30 days of total cost of power\nincluding O&M costs. DOP's accounts receivable are relatively low as more than\n80 percent of its sales are to industrial and bulk consumers that usually pay\nwithin the 30-day billing period.\n                                                       \n3  For CHPC, 40 percent of the investment was financed by a 15-year loan at 5 percent interest rate. For Kurichhu,\n40 percent of the capital cost is financed at an annual interest rate of 10.75 percent per annum payable in 15 years.\n40 percent of Tala Hydropower Project was financed by a loan with a 9 percent interest rate payable in 12 years.\n4  The loans from the Bank to the Government are on Asian Development Fund terms. For RE1, it was 1 percent service\ncharge with 40 years repayment period including 10 years grace period. For the proposed Project, the service charge\nis 1.5 percent, 32 years repayment period including an 8 year grace period.\n5 The foreign currency fluctuation will be passed on to the customers through an automatic foreign currency adjustment\nin the billing system.", "%%640 47915398 10804 % 8539135009)064\n2010 7.22.4071.           699,05     7,255,51  -             15,15       7,969,71  649,92     539,34     72,51       38,07       7,110,39  7,760,32   0.7           1.5           1.4           0.6           0.1            9.0 1,977.      959.         1,018.      1,278.      421.         408.         449.         699.         323.

Introduction\n1. This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  for  the  Sustainable  Rural\nElectrification  Project  is  based  on  the  investigations  and  findings  of  the  consultants  in\nassociation  with  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Division  of  Power  (DOP),  under  technical\nassistance (TA) 2912 BHU.1 The intensive data gathering and field survey including distribution\nline routing were undertaken by the domestic consultant in cooperation with local community\nmembers of districts and villages. The SIEE follows the Bank\u2019s standard format for such\nreports and addresses potential environmental impacts resulting from the location, design,\nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of the Project.\nB. Description of the Project\n1. Type of Project\n2. The proposed Sustainable Rural Electrification Project prepared by DOP under the\nEighth Five-Year Plan (FY1998-FY2002), as an integral part of the rural electrification program,\nwas originally created during the Sixth Plan (FY1987-FY1991) to electrify most villages in\nBhutan using hydropower. Based on the subsequent feasibility studies and field experience,\nrural electrification is being upgraded and to become more comprehensive using distribution\nnetworks as well as renewable power sources such as solar panels and mini/micro hydropower\ngeneration. The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s development policies and the\nBank's focus on Bhutan's infrastructure development.\n2. Category of Project\n3. The Project is classified under the Bank\u2019s Guidelines as Category B.\n3. Need for the Project\n4. It is estimated that over 87 percent of the Bhutanese population lives in rural areas and\nmore than 80 percent of the population leads an agrarian lifestyle. Most of the farmers do not\nhave access to electricity. Over 95 percent of the energy consumed in the rural area is from\nfuelwood. This makes Bhutan's per capita consumption of fuelwood (2.4 cubic meters) one of\nthe  highest  in  the  world  and  puts  tremendous  pressure  on  forest  resources.  Several\nGovernment-initiated projects aimed at reducing the dependency on fuelwood have not met\nwith very much success. Kerosene cookers, smokeless stoves, solar panels, and nontaxable\nfuel-efficient  electrical  appliances  are  a  few  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Government  to\ndecrease the consumption of fuelwood.\n5. In rural areas, where electricity is not available, fuelwood is used for cooking and\nheating. Apart from the depletion of forest resources due to the excessive use of fuelwood, a\nlarge section of the rural population that does not have access to electricity suffers from\nrespiratory problems. This can be attributed to the smoke emitted from use of kerosene lamps\n(wick type) for lighting and inefficient use of fuelwood for cooking and heating. Most of the rural\n                                                  \n1 TA 2912-BHU:  Second Rural Electrification Project, for $500,000, approved on 19 November 1997.", "Appendix 14, page 2\nareas are over 2000 meters above sea level, making the cold season extremely harsh, which\nleads to increased fuelwood consumption just for heating purposes. In general, however,\nfuelwood is mostly used for cooking purposes, except for a few wealthy citizens living in district\nheadquarters who use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Most Government staff use LPG or\nkerosene stoves for cooking purposes.  Kerosene lamps are used for lighting in almost all the\nrural areas where electricity is not available. Some farmers who cannot afford or have no\naccess to kerosene, use resin and coniferous wood sticks for lighting.\n6. To improve the standard of living, promote economic development, and improve health\nand sanitation standards, the Eighth Plan provides for the expansion of the rural electrification\nprogram.  The  existing  electricity  networks  are  proposed  to  be  extended  into  rural  areas\nwherever there is excess power available. The Project proposes extension of high voltage\ndistribution systems from the nearest power sources to distribution transformers in designated\nvillages, together with the associated low voltage networks and consumer connections. In\naddition, solar panels will be installed at local community centers that are far from a distribution\nnetwork.\n4. Location\n7. The proposed Project covers the following districts in Bhutan:  Bumthang, Chhukha,\nDagana,  Lhuentse,  Mongar,  Paro,  Pema  Gatshel,  Punakha,  Samtse,  Sarpang,  Thimphu,\nTrashigang, Trashi Yangtse, Trongsa, Tsirang, Wangdue Phodrang.\n5. Size of Operation\n8. The proposed Project intends to provide infrastructure for the supply of electricity to\n6,038 new customers in 16 districts. In addition to distribution network expansion, solar panels\nwill be provided to three local community centers located far from power sources. Apart from\nthe construction of electrification network, some provisions will also be made for tools and\nvehicles.\n6. Proposed Schedule for Implementation\n9. The physical implementation of the Project will commence in  March  2001  and  be\ncompleted in September 2003.\n7. Description of Project\n10. The major part of the Project will involve construction of overhead electric lines at\nvoltages of 33 kV, 11 kV, and 0.4 kV. The lines will be of pole-type construction. Distribution\ntransformers and associated equipment will be mounted on the poles for supply of power into\nthe low voltage lines, connecting from there to consumers' houses and premises. Solar panels\nand supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system will be installed in premises of\npublic facilities and substations respectively.", "Appendix 14, page 3\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Resources\na. Topography\n11. Bhutan  is  wedged  between  India  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  along  the\nHimalayan Mountains, and covers an area of approximately 46,000 square kilometers with an\necosystem ranging from subtropical to alpine. The altitude in Bhutan ranges from about 200\nmeters (m) in the south to over 7,000 m in the north. Most of the country is almost completely\nmountainous, with deeply incised river valleys. Even the Sub-Himalayan foothills, which is a\nzone ranging from 500 to 3000 m is very rugged and drops sharply to the plains of India. The\nProject will span most of the country from east to west and will include a few southern districts\nas well. Therefore, all topographical features such as plains, valleys, and mountain ridges will\nbe encountered.\nb. Climate\n12. The huge extremes in elevation and topography of the country result in great diversity\nin  climatic  types,  characterized  by  a  wide  range  of  temperatures  and  precipitation.  With\nincreasing elevation, the climate changes from subtropical humid and subhumid, to temperate\nmonsoon humid and subhumid, to temperate alpine continental. Maximum temperatures reach\napproximately 40 degree Celsius ( C ) during summer in the plains, but in the mountainous\nregions, the temperature can fall to 20 degree C below zero during winter months.\n2. Ecological Resources\n13. Over 72 percent of Bhutan's total land area is under forest cover. Bhutan has one of\nthe richest floras in the world for a country of its size, due to a combination of climatic and\ntopographic diversity, and its position on the interface between the Indo-Malesian and Paleartic\nbiogeophysical  regions.  Natural  areas  not  covered  in  forest  are  commonly  covered  by\ntemperate  grasslands.  Over  26  percent  of  the  country  is  under  protected  area,  wildlife\nsanctuaries, national parks, and reserves. These were created to protect wildlife resources and\nendangered species. None of the areas to be electrified encroaches upon these protected\nareas and reserves.\n3. Human and Economic Development\na. Population and Communities\n14. The population of Bhutan was estimated at around 0.6 million in 1996, while its land\narea is around 46,000 square kilometers. The population growth rate is 3.1 percent per year.\nAbout 90 percent of the population lives in small villages scattered along the mountain slopes\nand valleys. The areas to be electrified under the Project are some of the most populated in\nthe country. The areas are characterized by houses that are widely scattered with a few shops,\nand some of the areas have small-scale industries. Some of the towns in the project area fall\nunder administrative centers and have basic health units (BHUs), hotels, primary schools,\nguest houses, Royal Bhutan Police centers and small local government offices. Most of the\nproject areas is linked by roads for vehicles.", "Appendix 14, page 4\n15. Over 80 percent of the population in the project area are farmers by profession and\nwork on their own land. The remaining 20 percent are either employed by the Government as\nfield extension workers from various Government departments, or have small businesses of\ntheir own, or are employed by a few small-scale cottage industries. Many of the villages\ncovered in the Project have access to BHUs, primary community schools, safe drinking water\n(through the Government rural water supply schemes), and vehicle roads or mule tracks.\nb. Industries/Infrastructure\n16. Chhukha  and  Samtse  are  the  only  districts  in  the  project  areas  that  have  major\nindustrial activity. Chhukha has three major industries that are the largest customers of DOP,\nnamely, Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd., Bhutan Chemical, Calcium Carbide Ltd., and Bhutan Board\nParticle Ltd.  Samtse has two major industries that also contribute to DOP\u2019s income, namely,\nPenden Cement Authority Ltd. and Bhutan Food Product Ltd.\n17. In the project area, there are also a few small timber sawmills, flour/husk mills, hand-\nmade paper units, small-scale weaving industries, handicrafts, small shops, and restaurants.\nA few places have general shops. The Government has initiated small industrial development\nand provides training in business  management.  Banking  institutions,  such  as  the  Bhutan\nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC), have spearheaded rural economic development by\nproviding easily available small loans to the farmers. Housing and truck loans have also been\nprovided by the institution. BDFC has a branch office in all the districts covered under this\nProject. The Bank of Bhutan has also granted loans to small-scale businesses.\nc. Land Use Planning\n18. Under  the  forestry  sector,  development  programs  for  plantations  and  their\nreinforcement, development of community and protected forestry, development and protection\nof critical watersheds and forest roads, and building of ranger offices have been initiated\nduring the Seventh Plan period. Some areas within the Project have been irrigated.\nd. Agricultural and Mineral Development\n19. Agricultural extension centers have been  established  in  several  villages  within  the\nproject area during the Seventh Plan period, which includes soil conservation, plant protection,\nseeds  and  seedling  supply,  farm  mechanization,  soil  fertility  development,  cash  crop\ndevelopment, and livestock and animal health improvement. Potential mineral resources and\nproposals for their development are as yet unknown.\n4. Quality of Life Values\na. Socioeconomic Values\n20. Most of the people make their living by subsistence farming. Many of the farmers in the\nproject area grow rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, vegetables, chilli, and mustard.\nPotato, apple, orange, beetle nut, cardamom, chilli, and soybean appear to be the main cash\ncrops.  Some  farmers  in  the  project  area  combine  crop  production  with  small  livestock\nhusbandry. The main domestic animals are cattle, mules, horses, pigs, yak, sheep, donkeys,", "Appendix 14, page 5\nand poultry. Cattle are kept for dairy products and to provide field manure. Horses are used\nprimarily to transport agricultural produce from remote villages, pigs are kept for meat and to\nproduce a cash income, and poultry are kept primarily for eggs.\n21. About 93 percent of the farmers in the project area use the produce of the land for their\nown subsistence. Food products such as rice, wheat/barley flours, sugar, salt, spices, edible\noils, milk products, and dry fish are imported through the Food Corporation of Bhutan and sold\nat the shops. Exports from the project area mainly consist of cash crops, if there is a surplus,\nhandicrafts, woven garments, and a few dairy product such as cheese and butter.\n22. Several people in each village have joined the local monk  body  or  nunneries,  as\nBhutanese predominately follow Buddhism, and religion plays an important role in the lives of\nevery family. These people are fed and clothed by the Government, and they are paid a small\nsalary as well. Furthermore, monks are held in great  respect  and  play  an  active  part  in\ncommunity life.\nb. Public Health\n23. Many  of  the  villages  surveyed  had  a  BHU  or  were  close  to  having  one.  The\nestablishment of BHUs in rural villages have made a positive impact, as the villagers no longer\nhave to travel great distances to receive basic medical treatment. However, the efficiency of\nthe BHUs is restricted due to lack of electricity. Photo-voltaic  electricity,  where  available,\nprovides only limited energy for lighting and equipment.\nc. Cultural and Religious Values\n24. It was found during the surveys that a lot of the family expenditure goes to perform\nreligious ceremonies. In fact, every family performs a minimum of two religious ceremonies a\nyear. Furthermore, a lot of the hard-earned money of the villagers is spent on undertaking\nreligious pilgrimages. The seriousness with which the people take their religion can be seen\nfrom the presence of many religious monuments, symbols, and temples. Almost all villages\nhave their own temple. Practically every house in the surveyed villages has an altar where\ndaily religious observance is carried out by the family.\nd.  Aesthetic Values\n25. As the low and high voltage lines will follow main roads and their supports will be of\npole type, the reduction of aesthetic values resulting from this Project will be minimal compared\nwith the largely unspoilt environment. Also most of the lines are in rural areas.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Problems Related to Location\na. Resettlement Issues\n26. As most of the distribution poles will run along road sides, the Project will not require\nmuch private land for erection of poles. The villagers in the project area are willing to allot the\nnecessary land required for the poles when it encroaches on their property. Small portions of", "Appendix 14, page 6\nland may be required for transformers. Some of the land needed for this purpose is presently\nprivately owned and will need to be acquired from its owners. Some of the land is cultivated\nand  the  Government  will  pay  some  compensation  for  this  land.  However,  the  presently\ncultivated land required for such permanent facilities will be minimal. No land value changes\nwill occur from the location of the Project, and therefore social inequities will be minimal. There\nwill be no resettlement of population due to the Project.\nb. Ecological Impacts\n27. The Project will have no impact on any rare or endangered flora or fauna species or\ntheir habitat. This is because (i) the Project does not comprise  a  mass  concentration  of\nconstruction, (ii) the Project is not concentrated in a particular area but is spread over 16\ndistricts, (iii) the Project does not encroach upon any precious ecological area or other valuable\nlands, and (iv) the project area has already been greatly modified by human activity. Site visits\nhave indicated that construction activities in these areas will in no way have any negative\nimpact on the ecology. Apart from minor brush clearing along the roadside, no deforestation\nwill be required. Moreover, the Project does not trespass on any water source areas.\n2. Environmental Problems Related to Design\n28. The Project will not interfere with other utilities, traffic, or access ways. The electricity\nwill be distributed throughout the project area by means of overhead distribution lines and\ntransformers. The lines will generally run along the side of the road and only minor bush\nclearing may be required for them. There will be no discharge of polluting materials, given the\nnature of the Project. There are very few cultural features that fall within the project area such\nas temples, monasteries, and the like. With proper planning of the route, none of the cultural\nfeatures will be disturbed.\n29. The impact of the lines and transformers will not have any impact on the ecology or\ncultural features, other than in terms of visual appearance and introduction of hazards arising\nfrom  the  presence  of  live  wires  and  apparatus.  There  will  be  no  blockages  of  wildlife\npassageways.\n3. Environmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n30. Most of the potential environmental impacts may occur during the construction stage.\nDue to the type of construction (mostly erection of poles and minor buildings) soil erosion and\nsilt runoff will be insignificant. Other major nuisance to nearby properties such as noise and\ndust will also be insignificant because of the nature of the work and low population density of\nrural areas. Minor social impacts will arise as a result of the presence of installation work force\nduring  erection  of  the  lines  and  connection  of  the  houses  to  the  network.  This  force  is\nexpected to number between 40 to 80 throughout the project area. However, this number\ncould decrease if local people from the beneficiary villages are hired for manual labour. This\nwould have a double benefit, firstly, the social impacts would be lower, and secondly these\nvillagers would earn some cash income.\n31. People from the villages to be electrified are willing to do the basic unskilled manual\nlabor required for the Project in and around their villages. A substantial portion of the labor\nforce may be recruited locally for unskilled work. A few foreign nationals may be required to\nassist during the initial phase of project supervision for newly introduced equipment, materials,\nand tools.", "Appendix 14, page 7\n32. The construction phase of this Project will in no way hamper wildlife movement, nor will\nit have any effect on utilities, traffic, access ways, services, or land values. It is envisaged that\nthe  construction  stage  will  not  create  any  ecological  impacts.  Adequate  and  regular\nsurveillance and supervision of construction activities will ensure that no significant damage\noccurs to ecology.\n4. Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n33. Since the beneficiary villages have not had electricity before, it is possible that they will\nbe unaware of the dangers of electricity and the possibility of health hazards. Therefore, it is\nrecommended that as areas get connected to the supply network DOP should continue a\ncampaign to promote public awareness about public safety and proper use and management\nof electrical current and appliances, in order to prevent electricity-related accidents, which\nusually follow the introduction of electricity to new consumers.\n34. The permanent labor force required for the maintenance of the network and collection\nof  payments  will  be  existing  staff  of  DOP  for  such  purposes  in  the  given  districts.  The\noperational phase will, in fact, generate the least ecological impacts among any of the other\nphases. This phase will, instead, bring about benefits to the environment as the villagers will\nbecome less dependent on forestry resources as electricity will substitute for the use of fossil\nfuels or fuelwood.\n5. Potential Environmental Enhancement Measures\n35. The main potential environmental enhancement measures are local social impacts,\nwhich  are  considered  to  be  significant  and  mostly  positive.  These  include  (i)  improved\nelectricity-dependent infrastructure, such as water pumping, telecommunications etc.; (ii) an\nimprovement  in  the  quality  of  life  through  pollution-free  lighting,  better  educational\nopportunities,  and  social  services  for  positive  regional  development  arising  through  the\navailability of electricity; (iii) enhancement of income and creation of jobs in the medium term;\nand (iv) reduction of the dependency on fuelwood in the long term.\n6. Additional Considerations (Compensation)\n36. A factor that needs to be considered is that during the construction phase, poles will\nneed to be erected. Some of the land required for this purpose may be privately owned. The\nlandowners will need to be compensated. Where private property is required for this Project,\nthe  owners  will  be  consulted  by  DOP  to  negotiate  right  of  access.  Consultation  and\ncompensation will need to be undertaken once the design of the Project has progressed to the\nnext stage. Compensation in cash will be provided by the Government to owners for crops and\ntrees located in right-of-way of the erected poles. The cash compensation for crops will be\nbased on productivity of the land in the past, while for trees will be based on type, age, and\ndiameter of trees.", "Appendix 14, page 8\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n37. Environmental monitoring programs associated with the Project will be conducted as\npart of DOP's regular monitoring programs. Regular inspection, especially during the rainy\nseason, will have  to  be  undertaken  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  site  stabilization  and\nrevegetation measures, if any, and to identify problem areas for immediate treatment and\nmaintenance operations. Particular emphasis will have to be given to erosion problems, if any,\nand timely remedial measures undertaken by minor civil work using cement and rocks as part\nof the monitoring program.\n38. Monitoring of forest resources and other ecological resources is the responsibility of the\nForestry Service Division (FSD), which has branch offices in all the districts covered by the\nProject. FSD will be notified and will be involved in the monitoring aspect. Nonetheless, DOP's\nmonitoring units will also note relevant adverse effects on ecological resources, if any, during\ntheir regular inspection field visits and notify the relevant authorities accordingly. The same will\nbe undertaken in the case of socioeconomic conditions, if required.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n39. The main findings and recommendations include the following:\n(i)  There will be significant socioeconomic and quality of life benefits for people in\nareas under the Project.\n(ii)  The impact on the environment will be minimal, as high and low voltage lines will\nmostly run along roads.\n(iii)  The project area does not encroach on any wildlife sanctuary, park, or reserve.\nNo rare or endangered species or their natural habitat will be affected. The\nProject does not trespass on any water source areas. Therefore, the ecological\ndamage arising from the Project will be minimal or nil.\n(iv)  The local residents will have to be consulted as to the planning of the works,\nand compensation should be paid where private land has to be used for the\nProject.\n(v)  A public awareness/education program regarding health hazards and proper\nuse and management of electricity and its appliances should be continued upon\nelectrification of villages.\nG. Conclusions\n40. The socioeconomic evaluation reveals that the proposed Project will definitely have a\npositive impact on the people living in the area concerned. The Project will have multiple\nbenefits such as increase in their income, improvement of their living standards and quality of\nlife, increase in employment opportunities, improvement of health standards, longer working\nhours, and access to social infrastructural development and educational opportunities.\n41. Although the Government does not require the preparation of an environmental impact\nassessment (EIA) for such projects, the screening process for the Project has been thorough.\nBased on the field investigation and the previous experience with projects of this nature, the\nenvironmental impact of the proposed Project will be minimal and not affect any nationally or\ninternationally endangered wild life and flora. Therefore, a full EIA is not required.", "Appendix 15, page 1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS\nA. Background\n1. More than 87 percent of Bhutanese people live in rural areas, most do not have access\nto electricity. Almost all the energy consumed in rural areas is from fuelwood. This puts pressure\non forest resources. Fuelwood is mostly used for cooking purposes, except for a few more\nwealthy households living in district headquarters which use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).\nKerosene is mostly used for lighting. Although forests occupy a dominant 72 percent of the total\nland area, one of the highest in the world, the supply of fuelwood is dwindling rapidly. The\nsolutions to the emerging energy problems  in  rural areas of  Bhutan  through  conventional\nsupplies are difficult. Moreover conventional fuels also potentially cause serious environmental\nhazards when used on a large scale. The per capita consumption of fuelwood in Bhutan is\nestimated to be 1.22 tons, which is one of the highest in the world.\n2. To improve the standard of living of the rural population, promote economic growth,\nreduce  overdependence  on  imported  fuels,  and  minimize  fuelwood  consumption,  the\nGovernment\u2019s Eighth Five-Year Plan provides for an expansion of rural electrification. The\nGovernment  plans  to  carry  out  rural  electrification  by  either  grid  extension  or  isolated\ndevelopment of small hydropower plants and other renewable energy sources such as solar\npanels, as an alternative source of energy for lighting, cooking, and heating.\n3. Stakeholder participation is a key to the success of rural electrification. Without strong\nand  sufficient  stakeholder  participation,  particularly  the  local  community,  the  utility  cannot\noperate a distribution system on a sustainable basis. The Project has been prepared using a\nparticipatory approach during the project preparatory technical assistance (TA).1 Through this\napproach,  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  including  communities,  nongovernment\norganization,  other  civil  society  organizations,  and  community-based  organizations  in  the\nproposed project area were obtained. A  social  economic  survey,  consultations as  well  as\ncommunity  participation,  were  conducted.  The  needs  for  rural  infrastructure  services,\nparticularly among the poor, as well as ways to improve the overall quality of life and prospects\nfor economic development in rural area were identified.\nB. Socioeconomic Profiles\n4. The present population is estimated at 600,000. A national health survey conducted in\n1994 indicates that infant mortality has fallen since 1984, from 142 per 1,000 births to 70 per\n1,000 births in 1994. With a crude birth rate estimated at 39.9 per 1,000 population, reduced\nmortality, and fertility remaining high at 5.6, the national population growth rate is estimated to\nhave increased to 3.1 percent from a previous estimate2 of 2.0 percent per annum.\n5. The literacy rate is 54 percent. The situation has improved over  the  last  decades,\neducational infrastructure has expanded dramatically since the start of the first Five-Year Plan in\n1961.  In  1959,  there  were  only  11  primary  schools  in  the  entire  country,  and  a  student\npopulation of 440. There are now over 100,000 students in 322 schools (primary, junior, and\nhigh schools) representing a gross enrollment of approximately 72 percent.\n                                                       \n1 TA 2912-BHU:  Second Rural Electrification Project, for $600,000, approved on 19 November 1997.\n2 Source:  1993 Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Planning.", "Appendix 15, page 2\n6. While a systematic expansion of  basic  social  infrastructure  services  throughout the\ncountry has achieved dramatic results over the past decades, approximately 80 percent of the\npopulation has no access to electricity. Over 50 percent of the population now has access to\npiped water and 80 percent to latrines.\n7. The majority of the population is primarily located in the rural areas of Bhutan, and is\ndependent on employment in agricultural activities to meet basic needs. A policy of balanced\nregional development  to direct  investment  into  less-developed  areas  of  the  country  forms\nanother important component in the structure of employment patterns. Of particular significance\nis the policy to locate power plants to promote industrial development in the interior part of the\ncountry. Another chance that has emerged in recent years was that villagers have been offered\na chance to join a national workforce to work for road construction, project, and construction\nsites.\n8. A most important sector of the economically active population in Bhutan is women.\nWomen already constitute 49.5 percent of the total population, and unlike many other countries,\nenjoy equal rights in law. Like men they play an important role both in the private and public\nsectors and own businesses. Practices related to inheritance make no differentiation between\nsexes, although in some communities daughters may inherit all the family possessions.\nC. Clientele Groups and Project Beneficiaries\n9. The proposed Sustainable Rural Electrification Project will bring direct benefits to 5,437\nrural household consumers or approximately 43,500 people in the selected 16 of 20 districts of\nBhutan together with associated commercial, social, and government sector consumers (601)\nsuch as shops, hotels, schools, basic health units, monasteries, etc. The Project\u2019s benefits\ninclude (i) provide opportunity for income-generating activities, (ii) generate employment through\nexpansion of cottage and small industries to mitigate rural poverty, (iii) improve quality of rural\nlife and (iv) provide adequate education and health services to rural people, particularly the poor\nand vulnerable groups through electrification by indigenous generated hydropower from existing\npower stations and solar panels.\nD. Poverty\n10. Bhutan\u2019s per capita gross national product (GNP) is approximately $485 (1996) and the\ncountry ranks 155th among 175 countries in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n1994 Human Development Index (HDI), published in 1997.3 Bhutan\u2019s HDI ranks lowest among the\neight  South  Asian  countries  and  is  lower  than  its  real  GDP  per  capita  rank  expressed  in\npurchasing power parity dollars. Reliable data on poverty are not available. Most of the population\ndepends on subsistence agriculture. On average, more than 60 percent of household expenditure\naccounts for food and beverages. A study to estimate the poverty line was conducted in 1998\nbased on the Indian yardstick for poverty. The expenditure required for 2,400 calories of daily\nintake in India was estimated at Nu2294 per capita per month at 1993-1994 prices. This figure was\nincreased to Nu322 to take into account the harsher climatic conditions existing in Bhutan. The\nincrease pertained to clothing, shelter, transport, and fuel. This is considered appropriate to\nestimate the expenditure in case of Bhutan, as nearly 70 percent of the total import trade and\n                                                       \n3 GNP per capita for Bhutan is calculated based on the official population estimate of 600,000 (1996), which is different\nfrom the latest United Nations estimate of 1.7 million (1994). HDI is based on the UN estimate. Efforts are being made\nby the aid community in consultation with the Bhutanese authorities to reconcile the population estimates.\n4 This estimate was worked out by the Expert Group of the Planning Commission, India and accepted by the\nGovernment of India in 1997.", "Appendix 15, page 3\n95 percent of the total export trade are with India. The consumer price index of Bhutan for food\narticles, at the end of 1993 was 313 (December 1979=100), which rose to 438.1 for the month of\nDecember 1997, a rise of 40 percent.  Accordingly, the amount required to meet the expenditure\nper  month  per  person  that  is  equal  to  2,400  calories  per  day  is  approximately  Nu504  for\nDecember 1998.\n11. From the field observations and the socioeconomic survey, it has been possible to\ndistinguish the poor from the better-off in the rural villages by the structure of their houses, the\nsize of their farm plots, and the nature of their economic activities. The villages to be electrified\nunder  the  Project  have  on  average  30  households  of  5-10  people  each.  Based  on  the\nsocioeconomic  survey of  the project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  1) about  70 percent  of  the\nhouseholds are living below the poverty line (see profile of consumers in Table A15).\n12. The higher income households have average incomes of about $300-400 per annum,\nand live in large, traditionally built houses constructed of wood and concrete, with large wooden-\nframe windows. The houses have corrugated iron or tile roofing, and a large open area under\nthe roof. These households permanently farm two or more hectares and have a dozen or more\ncattle, horses, and mules. Their farm incomes are supplemented by buying and selling village\nproducts and handicrafts or by making small loans to neighbors. The homes often have access\nto running water on or nearby the premises and an outside latrine. In villages already electrified,\neach household may have 10 or more light bulbs, space heating, a rice cooker, and a radio.\n13. The poor households in a typical village covered by the Project have an average income\nof about $144 per annum or Nu504 per person per month, derived almost exclusively from\nsubsistence farming. They supplement their incomes through the production of handicrafts,\nmainly traditional weaving. The houses are of very low quality, constructed mainly of woven\nsiding and thatched roofs. Unless a smokeless stove has been installed, cooking inside the\nhouse fills the interior with smoke. There are typically one or two small rooms with earthen\nfloors, and no sanitation or water supply facilities are available on the premises. Water must be\ncarried from a nearby stream or other source. The households cultivate less than one-half\nhectare and normally do not own any livestock.\nE. Impact on Poor Households\n14. Approximately 70 percent of the project beneficiaries are households below the poverty\nline and live in subsistence economy with small cash incomes from selling crops such as\nvegetables, mandarins, potatoes, asparagus, and apples. Some money also flows into rural\ncommunities as remittances from family members working in towns and from wage labor.\n15. The survey on electrified households\u2019 shows rural electrification has a positive impact on\nthe level of economic activity in electrified areas. Most businesses in these areas choose to\nelectrify  and  use  electricity  primarily  for  lighting.  Impressions  collected  by  the  Mission\nconcerning the productive use of rural electrification in Thimphu district are generally consistent\nwith the survey data. There was uniform evidence that rural electrification led to increases in\neconomic activity. In several villages, small businesses such as shops, saw mills, and rice mills\ncame into existence after electrification.\n16. The availability of electricity will become a stimulant to the creation of new rural industry\nand commerce. In Bhutan, agricultural processing in fact is the main direct productive use of\nelectricity in rural areas\u2014grain grinding, flour milling, rice husking, and production of seed oil.\nThe productive use of electricity will increase employment opportunities and reduce rural to", "Appendix 15, page 4\nurban migration. Furthermore, the supply of electricity to these lower income households is\nexpected to enhance their income-earning potential, as weaving and other cottage industry\nactivities can continue at night.\nF.  Impact on Women\n17. Focus group discussions with women indicate that they benefit substantially from rural\nelectrification, as they spend more time in the household and use improved lighting and any\nhousehold appliances more. Electrification in flourmills and other grain and food processing\nfacilities also reduce women\u2019s workload in the home. Furthermore, they also mentioned that\nelectrification of health clinics, schools, as well as better security from street lighting, also\nbenefited them and their children significantly.\n18. Because collecting wood is mostly women\u2019s and children\u2019s work in each household,\nwomen  will  benefit  substantially  from  rural  electrification.  Furthermore,  using  fuelwood  for\ncooking and heating causes respiratory diseases among women and children as they usually\nstay in their houses longer than men do. In addition, electrification in ricemills and other grain\nand food processing facilities also reduce women\u2019s workload in the home.\n19. To  ensure  that  women  and  men  are  participating  equally  in  the  Project,  gender\nconsideration has been addressed during the socioeconomic survey and Fact-Finding Mission.\nThe data collected during the socioeconomic survey of electrified and nonelectrified households\nincluded information regarding the ownership of households. The survey data show that over\n30 percent of the household owners are women, indicating that women have social esteem and\nstatus (the property is by way of inheritance). Therefore, they have always enjoyed equal status\nand the same level of freedom as men, according to the laws of the land.5\n20. It is pertinent to note that women\u2019s participation in household earning is significant. Both\nfrom the point of view of the quantum of work done, as well as income earned, women\u2019s\ninvolvement  is  equally  present.  As far as  community  participation  and  decision  making  is\nconcerned, it is understood that women are actively involved. Their participation in the decision-\nmaking  process,  especially  in  grassroots  community  meetings  (zomdus)  is  as  high  as\n70 percent.6 They also participate actively at the district and village development committees.\nWomen\u2019s participation in decision-making process is reported to be significantly high at the\ncommunity level and the Government is promoting it at the district and cluster of villages levels.\nG. Impact on Community\n21. In  addition  to  direct  enhancement  of  household  welfare,  policy  objectives  of  rural\nelectrification  emphasize  social  impacts  of  overall  benefit  to  the  community.  The  use  of\nelectricity by community services and positive impacts on reduction of population growth, rural-\nurban migration and modern lifestyle are usually expected to be substantial. Rural electrification\nwill be used by rural schools, and health clinics, and for street lighting and public buildings. The\nfact that there  is a  wider  range  of  goods and  services available  is  also a  benefit  to  the\ncommunity.  Less  tangibly,  the  availability  of  an  electricity  supply  tends  to  provide  rural\ncommunities with a psychological boost, improving the moral and civic pride of local people.\n                                                       \n5 Royal Government of Bhutan. 1998. The Middle Path: National Environment Strategy for Bhutan.\n6 Royal Government  of Bhutan. Eighth Five-Year Plan document.", "Appendix 15, page 5\n22. The Project will help extend the supply of electricity in rural areas to 16 out of 20 districts\nand thereby will contribute to a significant improvement in the quality of life of 5,437 rural\nhouseholds\u2014children being primary beneficiaries. Furthermore, the Project will provide 100\nsolar panels to remote areas in 3 districts, particularly for public facilities such as schools,\nhospitals, and monasteries. Therefore, this Project will contribute to the development of rural\nareas by facilitating economic opportunity through consumptive as well as productive uses of\nelectricity.\nH. Willingness to Pay and Affordability of Rural Electrification by Households\n23. Because  the  basic  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  welfare  of  the  rural\npopulation, it was important to conduct an analysis on what fraction of rural households can\nafford electricity supply. The socioeconomic survey has been conducted to (i) analyze  what\nnonelectrified  households  currently  spend on  energy  sources  that  substitute  for  electricity;\n(ii) analyze  expenditures  on  electricity  by  residential  consumers  in  electrified  areas;  and\n(iii) conduct surveys of potential consumers to know the extent they are willing and able to pay\nfor electricity.\n24. Further insight into the affordability of electricity supply can be obtained by surveying\nhouseholds as to their willingness and ability to pay for electricity supply. This was done by the\nJune 1998 survey (footnote 1) in at least two nonelectrified villages each in the Western,\nCentral,  and  Eastern  regions.  Approximately  95  percent  of  the  households  indicated  a\nwillingness to pay for electricity based on the amount of the monthly bill.7 While the rest have\npreferred a ceiling on the bill amount, which is much higher (3 to 4 times for metered consumers\nand still higher for unmetered ones). This percentage varied considerably between villages.\nDifferences in average village income levels are clearly responsible for part of the observed\nvariation in willingness to pay.\n25. At  the  current  level  of  consumption,  the  lowest  income  groups  spend  only  about\n3.2 percent of their income on electricity. Since the energy consumption pattern across the\nincome groups is only marginally at variance, and constitute a low share of total income and/or\nexpenditure, the higher income groups can pay at least four times the current tariff for their\nlevels of consumption on parity with low income counterparts.\n26. The survey indicates that 87 percent of households are ready to pay for the initial cost of\nhouse wiring, service connection, and the initial fee. The  poorest households  will  only  be\nrequired to pay Nu250 each for an electricity kit8 as deposit, and the Government will provide\nthe connection free of charge. A household that wants further extension of wiring may need to\nspend  approximately  Nu1,500.  Thus  a  total  cost  of  Nu1,750  needs  to  be  spent  by  the\nconsumers in the low-income group if they want extended house wiring. For poor nonelectrified\nhouseholds, these costs would represent a half to one month\u2019s income.\n27. When  asked  whether  they  would  require  a  loan,  nearly  27  percent  of  households\nindicated that they would require loans ranging between Nu5,000 to Nu15,000 to buy electricity\nappliances as well as to meet house wiring. Villagers could apply for a loan from Bhutan\nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC) through the rural credit scheme if he/she has some\nland or other property as collateral. When applying for a loan, a villager will usually receive\n                                                       \n7 The amount of monthly electricity bill for poorest household without a meter depends on the number of power points\nand light points. One light point will cost Nu5 and one power point Nu25. A poor household usually has 3 light points\nand one power point. The total amount of monthly electricity bill will be Nu40.\n8 The actual cost for the kit is about Nu1,500.", "Appendix 15, page 6\naround Nu50,000 per hectare of land or equivalent of other properties. The procedure for\napplying for credit is not difficult and it takes one to two months to get the credit.9 The interest\nrate  is  13 percent  per  year.  However,  during  the  focus  group  discussion,  some  women\nmentioned that for loans of small amounts (maximum Nu5,000), they can borrow from their\nrelatives or neighbors.\nI. Impact of Tariff Adjustment to Poor Households\n28. The  Government\u2019s  policy  is  to  guarantee  access  to  basic  services  to  the  entire\npopulation.  Consequently, once  a  village  is  electrified,  all  houses  are  provided  access  to\nelectricity albeit at different levels of services, with only one or two light bulbs for the poorer\nhouseholds.\n29. The current electricity tariff for residential and industrial consumers is Nu0.60 per kWh\nfor urban consumers and Nu0.50 per kWh for rural consumers. The Government plans to revise\nand increase the tariff gradually based on socioeconomic conditions, cost of power generation\nand supply, and impact on domestic industry. Such adjustments will give rise to the sustainable\ndevelopment of the power sector and facilitate the future corporatization of DOP. The next tariff\nadjustment is proposed at Nu0.70 per kWh and will be effective on 1 January 2000 for urban\nand industrial customers. The introduction of three-block tariff, which includes a lifeline tariff for\npoor consumers will create cross-subsidies within the electricity subsector (e.g., high income to\nlow income and intersector) and it is likely to ensure proper social balance.\n30. The present level of tariff for rural consumers is highly subsidized. Though there is a\nneed to increase the tariff from the point of view of the sustainability of DOP, the tariff structure\naddresses the issue of poverty, by proposing a lifeline tariff for low-end consumers. A poor\nhousehold uses the lifeline unmetered tariff, and each household could have maximum 3 bulbs\nand  one  power  point.  Regardless  of  electricity  power  being  used  under  the  current  tariff\nstructure using the kit, they pay a total of Nu40 per month (around 2.0 percent of household\nexpenditure for the lowest income category).\n31. Also, it is pertinent to note that the average amount spent on fuel (in nonelectrified\nareas) and on electricity (in electrified rural areas) is a very small proportion of the income as\nwell as expenditure (around 1 percent). The household survey also indicated the consumer\u2019s\nwillingness and ability to pay (the response showed that the consumers would not be reducing\ntheir present level of consumption even if the tariff were increased by 50 percent). It is thus felt\nthat the recommended tariff increases and structure do not have a significant impact on rural\nand poor consumers.\nJ. Land Acquisition and Compensation\n32. Although small amounts of land will be acquired and disturbed for the installation of\nsupporting poles, most of the poles will be implemented along the roadside for ease of future\nmaintenance. The Project will not necessitate resettlement of any people. The survey indicates\nthat the beneficiaries in the project area are willing to allot the necessary land for poles when it\nencroaches on their property. Small portions of land may be necessary for transformers. Some\nof the land needed for this purpose may be privately owned and acquired from its owners.\nAdequate market-based compensation will be paid for any disturbance to, or loss of, productive\nland.\n                                                       \n9 The length of loan processing depends on the success rate of repayment from the fellow villagers who borrowed\nmoney from BDCF.", "Appendix 15, page 7\n33. Presently the Project has no particular negative impact and requires no remedial action.\nDOP will maintain data and progress reports on implementation of land acquisition, a summary\nreport will be sent to the Bank annually for review and comments.\nK. Indigenous People\n34. Bhutan has some ethnic minority groups, though insignificant in number, and they live in\nisolated areas. Prominent among them are the Yak herders, who temporarily migrate from their\ninhabitancy to lower altitudes during winter. These along with other ethnic groups like Doya,\nLaya Lingzi, and Merak Sektang, and constitute less than 0.2 percent of the total population. As\nthe indigenous people live in areas that will not be covered by the Project, there will not be any\nnegative impact of the Project on them. Therefore, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan is\nnot required.\nL. Participatory Project Performance Monitoring System\n35. The project performance monitoring system will be carried out under the Project in\nassociation  with  DOP.  The  community-based  organizations  in  the  Gewok  will  verify  the\neffectiveness  of  project  activities  and  outputs,  as  well  as  the  reactions  of  the  intended\nbeneficiaries.  Regular  feedback  will  be  provided  through  the  project  implementation  units\nregarding the effectiveness of the Project and the necessary changes that may be required mid\ncourse. Regular monitoring reports will be included in a quarterly report prepared by DOP.\n36. DOP will conduct monitoring to enable postevaluation of the Project, and also to improve\nthe  planning  for  future  rural  electrification  projects.  The  proposed  project  performance\nevaluation  and  measurement  indicators  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Project Performance Management System. DOP will confirm, in consultation with\nthe Bank, a set of performance indicators and performance targets to monitor the benefits of the\nProject at the time of loan inception.\n37. The Bank through its TA on Power Sector Review to be implemented in 2002 will\nconduct comprehensive social impact monitoring and evaluation after completion of the Project\nto determine (i) total number of connected consumers in various categories, number of total\npotential consumers in those categories resident in the service area, and the connection ratios\nfor those categories at various dates after commissioning; (ii) average consumption rates for\nconsumers  in  each  category;  (iii)  description  of  new  economic  activities  induced  by  the\nintroduction of electricity; (iv) description of existing economic activities that have switched to\nusing electricity and thereby become more efficient and productive; (v) estimated total value of\neconomic activities induced by the rural electrification; (vi) estimate of average income levels;\nand (vii) survey of the perceived importance of various types of benefits created  by  rural\nelectrification, such as improved employment opportunities, increased income levels, improved\nquality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  and  improved  health  standards.  It  will  also  carry  out\nconcurrent  surveys  of  average  income  levels  in  some  representative  and  comparable\ncommunities that are not electrified to determine the incremental impact of rural electrification\non income levels and economic activities. In addition, the consultants will conduct monitoring\nand evaluation of the land acquisition activities, entitlements, time frame, and budget set out for\nthis process.", "Table A.15: Consumer Profile\nHouseholds in income category group Industries,  Solar Panel\nCommercial & Public  Connections\nDistrict Name 0-2000 2001-4000 4001-8000 8001-25000 Total\nInst.

General\n1. The economic rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on scenarios with and without\nthe Project, using constant 1999 prices covering the period from 2000 to 2025. The Project will\ncommence in September 1999, and physical construction is expected to start in April 2001 and\nbe completed by September 2003. The life of the network expansion plans is assumed to be 25\nyears.\nB. Cost Assumptions\n1. Capital and Operation and Maintenance Costs\n2. The capital cost for the Project has been estimated in dollars for the foreign exchange\ncomponent and ngultrum (Nu) for the local currency components at 1999 price levels. To\ncalculate the project rate of return, the capital cost is net of interest during construction and\nprovision for price contingency. The Project is not subject to any taxes.\n3. The annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the Project are estimated to be\n1 percent of the capital costs. System losses (during transmission and distribution) are assumed\nto be 15 percent as the end consumption will be mainly at the low voltage level.\n4. The economic cost of the Project is derived from its financial costs measured at the\nborder prices where the nontradable components were converted to world price numeraire\nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.9. The shadow wage rate for skilled labor is taken as 1.0\nas skilled workers are generally in short supply in Bhutan, and the prevailing market wages in\nthe project area are taken as corresponding to their supply price. The conversion factor for\nunskilled labor was assumed at 0.73. Based on the proportion of the traded and nontraded\nitems and skilled and unskilled labor, the overall conversion factor comes to 0.955.\n2. Cost of Energy\n5. The economic cost of energy has been estimated at about Nu1.37 per kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) calculated based on the weighted sum of the cost of energy generation at marginal costs\n(about Nu0.16/kWh) and lost exports to India (Nu1.50 per kWh). Bhutan exports its power to\nIndia after satisfying its domestic needs. At present, domestic consumption represents about\n20 percent of energy generation, and the balance is exported to India. With the Project, extra\npower supply for domestic use will come from lower exports to India although the incremental\npower supply required with the Project is quite low, it accounts for only about 2-3 percent of total\ngeneration capacity. However, with the additional generation capacity coming on stream in the\nfuture, the ratio of domestic sales to export sales will be further reduced. Conservatively, it was\nestimated that the overall domestic sales would represent only about 10 percent of total energy\nsales. The economic cost of energy was assumed to remain constant in real terms.", "Appendix 17, page 2\nC. Benefit Assumptions\n1. Domestic Consumers\n6. The proposed Project comprises 6,038 potential consumers in various districts. The\nmarket  mix  consists  of  predominantly  household  consumers  together  with  associated\ncommercial, social, and government sector consumers such as shops, schools, basic health\nunits,  and  monasteries.  The  economic  benefits  composed  of  the  nonincremental  and\nincremental benefits. The nonincremental benefit represents the cost savings from the displaced\nuse of alternative energy due to the Project. In this case, it is primarily kerosene for lighting,\nwhich is fully imported. This benefit was estimated at 80 percent of the total sales forecast and\nwas valued at the economic cost of kerosene. The incremental benefits is benefit from induced\nelectricity consumption (estimated at 20 percent of the sales forecast), which is valued based on\nwillingness to pay, or the weighted average price of the prevailing electricity tariffs and financial\nprice of kerosene.\n7. The financial price of kerosene is Nu4.40 per liter as compared with the economic price\nof Nu8.6 per liter. At present, all the kerosene is obtained from India, and the price paid by the\nconsumers in Bhutan is the same price paid in India, which is highly subsidized. Since the\npetroleum pricing of India (to Bhutan) is based on major cross subsidies across consumers,\nconsumers of kerosene are actually cross-subsidized by other consumers of petrol and diesel\nused  for  transportation  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Therefore,  as  India  is  selling\npetroleum products at roughly the same rate in Bhutan, this cross subsidy impact also applies to\nBhutan. The economic benefit calculation assumed that the kerosene subsidy (from India) will\nbe phased out at the time the Project is commissioned. This is in line with Government of India\nplans to fully deregulate kerosene from 2002 onward. The replacement value derived from\nkerosene is obtained based on the assumption that a kerosene lamp is assumed to consume\n0.025 liter per hour, which is equal to a 40-watt incandescent bulb. The cost of owning and\nmaintaining the kerosene lamps and electric bulbs have been considered to be of the same\norder and excluded from the analysis.\n2.  Motive Power Users\n8. In case of motive power users like village rice mills and saw mills, other industries and\nagricultural pumping, which presently use diesel engine-driven devices, the economic benefit is\nestimated considering the net savings that accrue to the economy due to (i) reduction in use of\ndiesel (import price) and (ii) reduction in capital (and maintenance) cost, i.e., electric motor cost\nversus diesel engine cost. The savings in fuel cost is estimated at Nu4.24 per kWh based on\nfuel consumption per kWh of 0.4 liters (including lubricant oil equivalent) and the cost of diesel\nper liter of about Nu10.60. Savings in capital and O&M cost is estimated at Nu0.34 per kWh\nbased on the following assumptions: (i) the capital cost per kW for diesel engines is Nu5,500 as\ncompared with Nu3,500 for an electric motor; (ii) a diesel engine has 10-year economic life,\nwhile an electric motor has about 15-year life; (iii) the O&M cost per kW of a diesel engine is\nhigher at 10 percent of capital cost as compared with only 4 percent for an electric motor; and\n(iv) 2,400 hours of  operation per annum.  The  standard  rating of a diesel  engine used  is\n7.5 horsepower (5.5 kW).", "Appendix 17, page 3\nTable A17: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(Nu million)\nFiscal Capital Energy O&M Total Economic Benefits Total Net\nYear Cost Cost Cost Cost Household Ind'l/Comm Public Benefits Cashflow\n1999            \n2000   4 2.92 0 0      42.92 0 0 0 0      (42.92)\n2001  215.45     8 .84      1.29    225.57          11.87            11.10        4.82         27.78    (197.79)\n2002  172.53   1 8.43      2.15    193.12          25.15            22.86        9.92         57.93    (135.19)\n2003     2 2.42      3.02      25.43          36.64            23.55      10.21         70.40       4 4.96\n2004   2 4.57      4.31      28.88          42.35            24.25      10.52         77.12       4 8.24\n2005   2 5.71      4.31      30.02          44.88            24.98      10.83         80.69       5 0.67\n2006   2 6.91      4.31      31.22          47.56            25.73      11.15         84.44       5 3.21\n2007   2 8.18      4.31      32.48          50.39            26.50      11.48         88.38       5 5.89\n2008   2 9.50      4.31      33.81          53.40            27.30      11.82         92.52       5 8.71\n2009   3 0.90      4.31      35.21          56.59            28.12      12.17         96.88       6 1.67\n2010   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2011   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2012   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2013   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2014   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2015   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2016   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2017   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2018   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2019   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2020   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2021   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2022   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2023   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2024   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\n2025   3 2.37      4.31      36.68          59.97            28.96      12.54       101.46       6 4.78\nO&M = Operation and Maintenance\nSource: Staff Estimates\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return 13.0%\nNet Present Value (10%)        75.2\nSwitching\nSensitivity Analysis EIRR NPV Value\n      Base Case 13.0%        75.2  \n1.
