An initial environmental examination was undertaken, and\na summary is a core appendix.\n\nSocial\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nA social impact analysis was undertaken, and a summary is a core\nappendix.\n\nAlthough  Bhutan  has  substantial  sources  of  clean  and  renewable\nindigenous hydropower energy, the distribution of electricity throughout\nthe  country  is  still  limited,  and  thus  approximately  80  percent  of  the\npopulation does not have access to electricity. The recent development\nof  social  infrastructure  for  basic  human  needs  such  as  hospitals,\nschools, radio broadcasting, and newspaper publishing has resulted in\nstrong  anticipation  of  electrification  for  rural  communities.  In  addition,\nrural  electrification  in  the  long  term  will  gradually  decrease  the\npressures  of  deforestation  due \nthe  world\u2019s  highest\nconsumption  of  fuelwood.  Furthermore,  positive  impacts  on  reducing\nmigration to the cities, population control, and overall rural lifestyle, are\nexpected to be substantial in the long term.\n\nto  one  of \n\nin \n\nimproving  sector  governance.  Through \n\nAlong with the proposed Project, the Bank is also playing a pioneering\nrole \nthree  cascading\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants,  Policy  and  Legal  Framework  of  the\nPower  Sector  Development  approved  in  1998,  Corporatization  of  the\nDivision  of  Power,  and  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Hydropower\nDevelopment  planned  in  1999  and  2001  respectively,  the  Bank  will\nassist  in  further  commercializing  of  the  power  sector  by  establishing\ntransparent  and  accountable  sector  operations  and  an  autonomous\npower  utility.  Thus,  the  Project  supports  the  Bank\u2019s  strategy  of\nbalanced  development  between  socioeconomic  priorities  and\ncommercialization of the electricity supply in Bhutan.\n\nThe  project  objectives  are  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  economic\ndevelopment. The Project will provide opportunities for cash-generating\nbusinesses,  create  jobs,  improve  quality  of  rural  life,  and  support\nadequate education and health services for rural people, especially low-\nincome  groups  in  Bhutan  by  improving  electrification  with  distribution\nnetwork  expansion  and  use  of  solar  panels.  The  Project  will  also\nfacilitate efficient use of limited skilled human resources of the Division\nof Power (DOP) by introducing a simple Supervisory Control and Data\nAcquisition (SCADA) system and support institutional strengthening by\ncorporatizing DOP.\n\n\fii\n\nThe Project is an integral part of the rural electrification master plan of\nBhutan.  The  Project  will  provide  power  to  6,038  consumers  in\nrural villages  of  16  districts  where  more  than  two  thirds  of  project\nbeneficiaries  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  project  scope\nincludes  (i)  rural  electrification  through  33  kV,  11  kV,  and  0.4 kV\ndistribution  systems;  (ii)  remote  rural  electrification  using  renewable\nenergy sources by providing solar panels for  local  community  centers\nincluding  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  local  community  facilities  in\nthree  districts;  and  (iii)  a  small-scale  pilot  SCADA  system  for\nsubstations close to Thimphu.\n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $12.5 million equivalent, of which\n$10.0 million (80 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $2.5 million\nequivalent(20 percent) is the local currency cost.\n\nSource\n\nBank\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n10.0\n0.0\n10.0\n\n         ($ million)\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.0\n2.5\n2.5\n\nTotal\n\n10.0\n2.5\n12.5\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\n7,206,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  the  Bank\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  an  8-year  grace  period,\nwith  a  1 percent  per  annum  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nPeriod of \nUtilization\n\nUntil 30 March 2004\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDOP  of  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  initially,  and  later,  the\ncorporatized DOP.\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nA project implementation unit will be set up in DOP to undertake day-\nto-day  project  implementation.  All  rural  electrification  construction  will\nbe undertaken by DOP  staff,  supplemented by  local  contract  laborers\nand village volunteers. Participation in and ownership of the Project by\nDOP and the beneficiaries is thus assured to be high.\n\nAll project equipment and materials to be financed under the Bank loan\nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement \nthe  Bank\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and\nmandatory  use of  the  Bank\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.

The consultants\nwill be selected in accordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants. The Bank has approved advance action for recruitment\nof consultants.\n\n\fiii\n\nBy 30 September 2003\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  quantified  in  terms  of\nconsumer  surplus  based  on  willingness  to  pay  and  savings  due  to\nreduction  of  kerosene  consumption  for  lighting  and  the  use  of  more\nefficient electric motors as compared  with  diesel engines.  The  overall\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  about  13  percent.  The  Project  will\n(i) improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  people  in  the  rural  area,\n(ii) provide  opportunities  for  cash-generating  businesses  and  thus\npromote economic development, (iii) reduce the use of fuelwood in the\nlong  term,  which  is  hazardous  to  the  health  of  the  people,  and\nthe  pressure  on  deforestation,  and  (iv)  make  social\ndecrease \ninfrastructure  facilities,  such  as  hospitals,  schools,  and  other  local\ncommunity  facilities,  fully  functional.  It  is  estimated  the  Project  will\nprovide  115,000  person-days  of  unskilled  employment  opportunities\nparticularly for the poor.\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  electricity  service  and  improve  standards  of\nliving and quality of life for 5,437 households in rural areas. More than\ntwo thirds (69.8 percent) of the beneficiaries of rural electrification are\nfrom  poor  or  low-income  households.  The  socioeconomic  survey\nindicates  that  more  than  two  thirds  of  the  targeted  households  fall\nbelow  the estimated  poverty  line  of  Bhutan. Women  and  children  will\nbe  the  prime  beneficiaries  of  rural  electrification  as  they  spend  more\ntime  in  the  household.  It  will  have  a  beneficial  impact  upon  their\nlifestyle as electricity provides a cleaner less harmful energy substitute,\nbetter lighting in homes and schools, and improved support for health\ncare.\n\nTechnical Assistance A  TA  grant  of  $600,000  financed  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  will\nsupport DOP\u2019s transition from a Government division to a corporation.\nThe  major  works  will  include  (i)  conducting  asset  registration  and\nvaluation  of  DOP;  (ii)  recommending  a  financial  structure  for  DOP;\n(iii) formulating  the  organizational  structure  of  the  corporatized  DOP\nincluding  administrative  matters;  (iv) establishing  a  tariff  adjustment\nmechanism based on financial projections; (v) facilitating registration of\nthe corporatized DOP as a company; (vi) finalizing a necessary human\nresource  development  program  in  consultation  with  the  Bank;  and\n(vii) providing  necessary  training  on  commercial  accounting  and\ncorporate and financial management to DOP staff.\n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Sustainable Rural Electrification Project. The report also\ndescribes proposed technical  assistance  (TA) for the  Corporatization  of  the  Division  of  Power\n(DOP),  and  if  the  proposed  loan  is  approved  by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the  authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nDuring  the  1998  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan\nconfirmed its request for a Bank loan for the Project and an accompanying advisory TA for the\nCorporatization  of  DOP.  The  Project  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  project  preparatory  TA\n(PPTA)  funded  by  the  Bank.1  The  proposed  TA  is  a  subsequent  assistance  for  the\ncorporatization  of  DOP  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  previous  Bank\u2019s  advisory  TA.2\nAppraisal was carried out from 19 to 30 July 1999.3\n\n3.\nThe  Bank  is  the  lead  multilateral  financing  institution  in  Bhutan  and  since  1993  has\nplayed a pioneering role in the development of the country\u2019s power sector.  Under the  ongoing\nloan,4  which  was  the  first  loan  for  the  power  sector  in  Bhutan  from  a  multilateral  financing\ninstitution,  the  Bank  is  undertaking  comprehensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government;  they\nhave agreed on a time-bound action plan for the corporatization of DOP, as well as retail tariff\nadjustments to prepare for corporatization. This Project will take the reform process further.\n\nBased on a careful field survey and sector analysis, the Bank has sought to balance the\n4.\ncommercial and financial  development  of  the power  sector  with  the  socioeconomic  priority  for\nelectricity supply. Considering the institutional and human resource constraints, and absorptive\ncapacity  of  Bhutan,  the  reform  process  for  the  power  sector  is  staged  and  is  supported  by\ncascading TAs. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBhutan was virtually isolated from the rest of the world prior to the early 1960s, with an\n5.\neconomy based on subsistence agriculture. While work under a series of five-year plans helped\nestablish basic infrastructure in the economy,5 it was not until the 1980s with the commissioning\nof  the  Chhukha  hydropower  plant  that  a  diverse  economy  really  began  to  emerge.  With  the\nadvent  of  hydropower  in  the  country,  and  manufacturing  enterprises  benefiting  from  low  cost\npower, gross domestic product (GDP) increased in the late 1980s to nearly 8 percent per year.\nWith no large projects coming onstream, industrial growth in Bhutan has slowed in recent years,\nbut the country still maintains GDP growth rates in excess of 5 percent.  The Eighth  Five-Year\nPlan,  FY1998-FY2002  projects  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  6.5  percent  during  the  plan\nperiod and about 5.5 percent during the first two  years of the  plan.  Although overall  growth  in\nthe  economy  is  currently  on  track  to  achieve  the  Eighth  Plan\u2019s  goals,  inadequate  physical\n\n                                                       \n1 TA 2912-BHU: Second Rural Electrification Project, for $500,000, approved on 19 November 1997.\n2 TA 2400-BHU: Institutional and Financial Development of DOP, for $400,000, approved on 30 September 1995.\n3 The Mission comprised C. Pappas, Sr. Project Specialist/Mission Leader; Y. Kho, Financial Analyst; S. Handayani,\nSocial Development Specialist; M. Hamano, Project Engineer; S. Ho, Programs Officer/Economist; and C. Gautrot,\nCounsel.\n\n4  Loan 1375-BHU: Rural Electrification Project, for $7.5 million, approved on 30 September 1995 with the purpose of\n\n5\n\nelectrifying about 3,100 customers in seven districts.\nSee also CER: BHU 99012:  Country Economic Review, Bhutan, May 1999.\n\n\f2\n\ninfrastructure, including lack of an efficient road network to markets, remains a major constraint\nto further development of the country in the longer term.\n\n6.\nThe  Government  is  improving  its  development  administration  by  decentralizing  and\ninvolving the people in the policy-making process. The King visited and consulted with people in\nall 20  districts  of  Bhutan  on  the  Eighth  Plan.  The  King  explained  the development program  in\ntheir  districts  and  listened  to  their  views.  Similarly,  through  the  district  and  local  development\ncommittees, decision making has been gradually decentralized and made more participatory. In\naddition, at the last National Assembly, the King withdrew as chair of the Council of Ministers in\nJuly  1998,  and  the  National  Assembly  elected  new  cabinet  members.  At  the  same  time,  the\nKing  empowered  the  National  Assembly  to  dismiss  him  with  a  vote  of  no  confidence.  The\nPlanning  Commission  of  the  Government  was  also  recently  reconstituted  to  accommodate\nbottom-up planning process from each level of local communities.\n\n7.\nBhutan  continued  to  experience  strong  growth  in  production  in  1999,  with  real  GDP\ngrowth at 5.8 percent. Because of the Government\u2019s demonstrated support for implementing the\npolicy reforms and fulfilling the goals outlined in the Eighth Plan, the economy should continue\nto  experience  output  growth  in  excess  of  5  percent  for  FY1999.  Fiscal  policy  in  FY1998\nremained prudent with current revenues exceeding current expenditures. Although tax revenues\nremain relatively low\u2014less than 7 percent of GDP\u2014preparations for the introduction of personal\nincome tax are still ongoing, and its introduction should help diversify the source of revenues in\nthe  country.  Corporate  taxes  and  profit  transfers  from  the  Chhukha  hydropower  plant  are  the\nGovernment\u2019s  main  source  of  revenue,  accounting  for  41  percent  of  current  revenue.\nProvisional estimates show an overall budget surplus of more than 3 percent of GDP in FY1998,\ncompared  with  a  deficit  of  2.4  percent  of  GDP  in  the  previous  year.  The  scope  for  monetary\npolicy is limited because of the fixed exchange rate arrangement and the large quantity of Indian\nrupees circulating freely in the economy. Inflation in FY1998 rose to 9 percent from 7.4 percent\nas of the end of 1998.\n\n8.\nExports grew by 12 percent in FY1998 in dollar terms, much higher  than  the 4 percent\ngrowth in imports. As a result, the trade deficit declined from 9 percent of GDP to 6 percent, and\nthe current account deficit fell from 16 percent of GDP to 12 percent. Bhutan maintained a slight\ntrade  surplus  with  India,  the  country\u2019s  main  trading  partner,  but  the  bilateral  trade  in  services\ncaused  a  current  account  deficit.  Capital  flows,  mostly  in  the  form  of  aid  for  infrastructure\ninvestments,  were  more  than  sufficient to  cover  the  current  account  deficit.  By  the  end  of  the\nfiscal  year, foreign  reserves  exceeded $200  million, enough  to  cover  more  than  19 months  of\nimports.  Debt  service  in  FY1998  was  11  percent  of  merchandise  export  earnings,  but  the\ncountry\u2019s convertible currency inflows will come under increasing pressure as more of the grace\nperiods expire on the concessional debt Bhutan acquired in the 1980s.\n\nIncreased efforts will be needed to prevent any deterioration in the fiscal situation, while\n9.\nsafeguarding productive expenditures, social services, and operation and maintenance (O&M).\nThe  introduction  of  a personal  income  tax  will  be  a promising  step  toward broadening  the  tax\nbase,  but  direct  cost  recovery  measures,  such  as  introducing  user  fees  and  rationalizing\nelectrical  tariffs,  also  need  to  be  considered.  Managing  the  diverse  number  of  development\nprojects is straining the Government\u2019s limited resources. To effectively manage an increasingly\ncomplex economy, the central Government must devolve some project  responsibilities  to  local\ngovernments. This has the added benefit of increasing community ownership of project results.\nFurthermore, more private sector involvement will be required if the Government is to maintain a\ncompact civil service.\n\n\f3\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nEnergy Consumption and Sources\n\nBhutan\u2019s  per  capita  energy  consumption  is  relatively  high  compared  with  other\n10.\nneighboring  countries  such  as  Nepal  because  its  forest  resources  provide  an  abundant  and\nreadily  available  source  of  energy.  Per  capita  energy  consumption  including  noncommercial\nenergy  amounts  to  approximately  0.8  ton  of  oil  equivalent.  Although  the  local  units  of  the\nForestry Services Division are regulating the cutting down of  live  trees, fuelwood nevertheless\naccounts  for  more  than  75 percent  of  total  energy  consumption  and  for  virtually  all  non-\ncommercial energy  consumption  in  rural  areas.  Households  consume 95  percent  of fuelwood,\nthe Government and commercial entities use 3 percent, and agriculture and industry use about\n1  percent.  Per  capita  consumption  of  fuelwood  used  mainly  for  cooking  and  heating  is,\nestimated at 1.22 tons, one of the highest rates in the world.\n\n11.\nSince Bhutan has no known reserves of fossil energy resources such as oil and natural\ngas, all petroleum products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel oil, and petrol for\nlighting, cooking, and transportation are imported. The general demand for petroleum products\nhas  been  increasing.  Petroleum  products  are  imported  and  distributed  by  two  private\ncompanies,  Bhutan  Oil  Distribution  and  Druk  Petroleum  Company.  There  are  24  fuel  depots\nsituated  at  convenient  points  in  various  districts  (dzongkhags).  The  Ministry  of  Trade  and\nIndustry  (MTI)  regulates  the  price  and  supply  of  petroleum  products  aligned  with  Indian\ndomestic  prices.  Import  details  of  petroleum  products  from  1992  to  1997  are  indicated  in\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1:  Import of Petroleum Products (1992 to 1997)\n\nProduct\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\nKerosene  (kilo liters)\nDiesel  (kilo liters)\nPetrol  (kilo liters)\nLPG  (tons)\n\n7,122\n16,778\n3,506\n720\n\nLPG = Liquefied Petroleum Gas\n\n8,078\n16,461\n3,469\n1,800\n\n6,691\n17,647\n3,530\n1,741\n\n8,236\n21,193\n4,151\n1,675\n\n12,152\n20,343\n3,852\n1,675\n\n9,612\n20,403\n4,122\n2,920\n\n12.\nThe  most  important  natural  resource  of  Bhutan  is  water.  The  mountainous  terrain  and\nthe network of perennially flowing rivers and streams provide an abundant source of renewable\nenergy. The four major rivers, Ammochhu, Mangdechhu, Sankosh, and Wangchhu, all flow from\nnorth to south, and discharge into the Brahmaputra River in the plains of India and Bangladesh.\nThese rivers provide significant hydropower potential. Compared with the theoretical potential of\n30,000  megawatts  (MW)  capacity  of  hydropower,  the  identified  hydropower  projects  are\nexpected  to  harness  a  capacity  of  16,280  MW  based  on  the  available  feasibility  and\nprefeasibility studies. This may be compared with the 23 run-of-river hydropower stations with a\ntotal installed capacity of only 344 MW in 1998. Although the domestic peak electricity demand\nis  72  MW,  power  exports  to  India  are  a  major  foreign  exchange  earner  for  Bhutan.  The\nhydropower  potential  presents  a  significant  opportunity  for  future  expansion  and  economic\nbenefit, with minimal environmental impacts, in view of an increasingly large export  market for\npower in the subregion.\n\n13.\nTo date, about 60 biogas plants have been built in several districts and are used only for\nlighting. There are 1,316 solar panels existing in remote areas to charge batteries, particularly in\nschools,  basic  health  units,  and  monasteries.  Because  of  sufficient  sunshine  available  in\n\n\f4\n\nBhutan, solar panels have proved to be a viable alternative of providing grid  supply  to  remote\nareas. Experiments with wind energy applications for battery charging are being undertaken in\ntwo districts to determine the sustainability of wind-based generation.\n\n2. \n\nThe Power Sector\n\na. \n\nInstitutional Overview\n\nUnder  the  current  structure  of  the  power  sector,  policy  making,  regulation,  system\n14.\ndevelopment, and operation of the power sector are the responsibility of DOP. DOP distributes\nelectricity  at  the  district  and  village  levels  through  electricity  supply  units  and  electricity\nsupply subunits.  In  a  policy  directive  issued  in  late  1993  during  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan\n(FY1992-FY1997) period, the Government devolved responsibilities for power supply and O&M\nof distribution systems to the district level. This was done in seven districts, in a move designed\nto \nin  planning  and\nimplementation of the electrification program. Decentralization of responsibilities for power is to\nbe eventually extended to all 20 districts of the country.\n\nto  enhance  community  participation \n\nimprove  effectiveness  and \n\n15.\nThe Chhukha Hydro Power Corporation (CHPC), which is a wholly Government-owned\ncompany  registered  under  the  Bhutan  Companies  Act,  accounts  for  336  MW  of  the  country\u2019s\ntotal generating capacity of 359 MW. In FY1997, DOP purchased 360 gigawatt-hours (GWh) or\n94  percent  of  its  requirements  from  CHPC.  That  same  year,  CHPC  exported  1,430  GWh\n(78 percent  of  the  energy  generated)  to  India.  Further  development  of  the  power  sector  is\ncrucial  to  allow  the  Government  to  generate  revenue  required  for  O&M  of  the  sector,  future\nexpansion of social programs, and sustained overall economic growth.\n\n16.\nThe Kurichhu  Project Authority  was  created  for  the  Kurichhu  Hydropower  Project.  The\nKurichhu  Project  (60  MW,  funded  by  India)  in  the  eastern  region  and  the  Basochhu  Project\n(60.8 MW,  funded  by  Austria)  in  the  western  region  will  be  completed  during  the  Eighth  Plan\nperiod. The infrastructure development activities and civil works of the Tala Hydropower Project\n(1,020 MW, funded by India) have also commenced under a separate entity, namely, the Tala\nHydroelectric  Project  Authority.  The  governments  of  Norway  and  Japan  are  funding  full-scale\ntechnical  feasibility  studies  for  the  Mangdechhu  Hydropower  Project  (approximately  360  MW)\nand  Punatsangchhu  Hydropower  Project  (approximately  760  MW).  Mangdechhu  Hydropower\nProject feasibility study will be completed by the end of 1999 and the Punatsangchhu feasibility\nstudy  by  early  2001.  Because  the  Government  fully  recognizes  the  implication  of  hydropower\ndevelopment, environmental and socioeconomic impact analyses have been undertaken as part\nof  the  detailed  feasibility  studies  of  these  two  new  hydropower  projects  in  accordance  with\ninternationally acceptable guidelines.\n\nb. \n\nSupply and Demand\n\n17.\nIn FY1997, the total electricity consumption of Bhutan was 366 GWh with peak demand\nof  72  MW.  The  five-year  average  of  the  load  growth  since  FY1992  was  approximately\n19 percent per annum on energy basis. This high load growth was due to the commissioning of\nseveral electricity-intensive industries such as Bhutan Board Products Ltd., Bhutan Carbide and\nChemicals Ltd., and  Pendon  Cement  Authority  Ltd.  from  FY1995  to  1996.  Another  electricity-\nintensive  industry,  Bhutan  Ferro  Alloys  Ltd.  was  commissioned  in  1993.  The  share  of  the\nindustry sector reached about 82 percent in FY1997 of total energy sold by DOP. The historic\nannual load growth of the residential and commercial customers of DOP is about 5 percent per\n\n\f5\n\nannum.  By  the  end  of  FY1997,  DOP  consumers  totaled  30,321,  and  39  towns  and  363  rural\nvillages were electrified by DOP.\n\n18.\nThe  total  energy  requirement  of  DOP  was  383  GWh  in  FY1997;  CHPC  supplied\n361 GWh directly to DOP\u2019s transmission network at the price of Nu0.30 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nIn addition, 7 GWh was purchased from CHPC through the Indian grid system with the wheeling\ncharge of Nu0.05 per kWh. The balance was supplied by mini- and microhydropower plants as\nwell as diesel generators through their dedicated isolated networks. The average system loss of\ntransmission and distribution systems including nontechnical losses, in the past five years was\nabout  9  percent.  This  performance  is  mainly  due  to  the  large  share  of  the  high  voltage\ncustomers such as electricity-intensive industries. The system loss of low voltage customers is\napproximately 15 percent. Under the current power purchase agreement with India, CHPC has\nno obligation for power export to India on a fixed amount (capacity and energy) basis. The first\npriority is to supply the necessary electricity to DOP for domestic consumers, and the balance of\nelectricity output of CHPC is to be exported to India. The power supply and energy balances of\nDOP from FY1991 to FY1997 are given in Appendix 2.\n\nc.\n\nExisting Power System\n\n19.\nA  milestone  event  for  the  power  sector  was  the  commissioning  of  the  first  unit  of  the\nChhukha  hydropower  plant  in  1986  with  assistance  from  the  Government  of  India.  By  1988,\nthree further units had been commissioned at Chhukha, increasing its total installed capacity to\n318 MW.  With  completion  of  the  second  tailrace  tunnel  in  1995,  the  installed  capacity  of\nChhukha reached 336 MW. Since commissioning of the first unit, 85 to 90 percent of generated\nelectricity has been exported to India. Chhukha is the largest single foreign exchange earner of\nBhutan.  Because  Bhutan  could  not  finance  Chhukha\u2019s  investment  costs  and  revenues  of  the\npower  export  were  in  Indian  rupees,  which  were  not  convertible  at  that  time,  the  Project  was\ndeveloped  on  a  grant  and  loan  basis  by  the  Government  of  India.  In  return,  India  receives\nChhukha\u2019s excess electricity for 99 years.\n\n20.\nAlthough  the  Chhukha  hydropower  plant  has  the  dominant  capacity,  there  are\n8 minihydro  plants  with  capacities  ranging  from  300  kilowatt  (kW)  to  1,500  kW,  and\n14 microhydro plants with capacities ranging from 20 kW to 200 kW. The total installed capacity\nof microhydropower plants reached 1,000 kW.\n\n21.\nElectrification of the eastern and central parts of Bhutan was achieved using the Indian\ngrid system. During 1969-1970, the Gelephu, Samdrup  Jongkhar, and  Sarpang  districts  in the\nsouthern  part  of  Bhutan  were  electrified  through  connection  to  the  grid  of  Assam  State\nElectricity Board of India. Similarly, the commissioning of the Jaldakha hydropower plant in 1972\nin West Bengal led to the electrification of the neighboring districts of Phuntsholing, Samtse, and\nSipsoo in Bhutan through the West Bengal State Electricity Board of India.\n\nThe  current \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  system \n\n22.\nthree\ncomponents:  (i)  the  western  grid  system  supplying  electricity  to  the  western  part  of  Bhutan\nincluding  Thimphu,  fed  from  Chhukha  and  other  small  power  plants,  and  connected  to  the\n220 kV  Indian  grid  system  for  power  export  from  Chhukha;  (ii)  local  transmission  network\nsupplied from  the  Indian grid  system  such  as Gelephu and Samdrup  Jongkhar electric  supply\nunits served by Assam State Electricity Board and Samtse district served by West Bengal State\nElectricity  Board;  and  (iii)  isolated  local  distribution  network  served  by  mini/microhydropower\nplants  such  as  Bumthang  and  Trashigang  electric  supply  units.  A  132  kV  transmission  line\nassociated with  the  Kurichhu  Hydropower Project  and  a 400  kV  transmission  line  to evacuate\n\nin  Bhutan  comprises \n\n\f6\n\npower from the Tala Hydropower Project are presently under construction and are being funded\nby  the Government  of  India.  Details  of  the  major  components  of  the existing power  system  in\nBhutan are given in Appendix 3.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n23.\nUnder  the  Eighth  Plan,  the  Government  aims  to  accelerate  growth  and  improve  living\nstandards,  while ensuring  the preservation of the  country\u2019s  environment  and  cultural  heritage.\nThe  Government  also  aims  to  build  and  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment  by  gradually  reducing  its  own  role  in  commercial  areas  of  the  economy  by\ncorporatizing or privatizing public  sector entities,  and  by addressing structural and  institutional\nconstraints.  Postal  services  and  urban  services  were  corporatized \nin  1997,  and\ntelecommunications  will  be  corporatized  in  FY2000.  The  Plan  also  focuses  on  revenue-\ngenerating  hydropower  development  and  industrialization,  human  resource  development,\nagriculture,  and  social services,  mainly  through  expansion,  consolidation, and  improvement  of\nthe  existing  facilities.  The  share  of  electricity  in  GDP  will  be  maintained  at  above  8  percent\nduring the entire Eighth Plan period. To achieve this, the Government is currently constructing\nthe three hydropower projects:  Basochhu, Kurichhu, and Tala.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Power Sector\n\n24.\nThe Government of India provides more aid to the sector than any other funding source,\nand has contributed greatly to the expansion of the power sector. The Government of India has\nfunded  all  three  (Chhukha  [336  MW],  Kurichhu  [60  MW],  and  Tala  [1,020  MW]  of  the  major\nhydropower plants together with their associated high voltage transmission lines for evacuation\nof the  generated power from  these  plants.  In addition, from  1967  to 1988,  the Government of\nIndia  assisted  with  the  installation  of  minihydropower  plants  in  Gidagom,  Gyetsa,  Khaling,\nMongar,  Paro,  Trashigang,  Thimphu,  and  Wangdue  Phodrang.  The  total  capacity  of  these\nminihydropower  plants  was  4.9  MW  in  1997.  Rehabilitation  of  the  existing  minihydropower\nplants and urban distribution system continues to be assisted by the Government of India.\n\n25.\nJapan  too  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  the  power  sector.  From  1986  to  1992,\n13 microhydropower  plants  with  total  capacity  of  980  kW  were  commissioned  for  the\nelectrification of isolated remote areas of Bhutan through the assistance of the Government of\nJapan.  These  microhydro  plants  were  constructed  under  a  self-help  scheme  in  which  the\nvillagers provided free labor and customers paid for wiring of their homes. Japan in continuing\nits involvement through the feasibility study for the Punatsangchhu Hydropower Project.\n\n26.\nThe Government of Austria is another major bilateral source of aid to the power  sector\nby  financing  the  Basochhu  hydropower  plant  (60  MW)  located  in  the  Sankosh  River  basin.  It\nalso funded the 2.2 MW Rangjung scheme in Trashigang District, which was commissioned in\n1998. The Government of Austria is also considering providing assistance for human resource\ndevelopment of DOP in association with the Bank.\n\nThe Government of  Netherlands  provided assistance  with  rural  electrification  for  about\n27.\n1,200 households from 1995 to 1998. It also assisted with the installation of solar home systems\nduring the same period.\n\nThe  United  Nations  Development Programme  (UNDP) and  the Government  of  Norway\n28.\nfunded  the  Bhutan  Power  System  Master  Plan  as  a  World  Bank-executed  project  in  1993.\nCurrently, UNDP is undertaking a feasibility study of mini/microhydropower plants funded by the\n\n\f7\n\nGlobal  Environmental  Facility  (GEF)  and  the  Government  of  Sweden.  The  governments  of\nNorway  and  Japan are  funding  full-scale  technical  feasibility  studies  for  the  Mangdechhu  and\nPunatsangchhu hydropower projects respectively. The studies will be completed by 2000.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s operation for the Bhutan power sector commenced in 1993. Since then, the\n29.\nBank has provided one loan (footnote 4) and 5 TAs\u20142 PPTAs and 3 advisory TAs out of which,\none PPTA and one advisory TA are still being implemented.6  Along with project implementation\nfor the sustainable development of the power sector, the Bank has focused on the institutional\ndevelopment  of  the  power  sector  and  sector  reform,  which  are  not  being  covered  by  other\nfunding agencies. The list of the external assistance from 1993 onward is given in Appendix 4.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n30.\nTo  date,  the  Bank  has  provided  grants  for  two  PPTAs  and  two  advisory  TAs,  and\nfinanced one loan for the rural electrification program. Another advisory TA for Policy and Legal\nFramework  for  Power  Sector  Development  commenced  in  May  1999.  The  major  obstacles\nidentified  for  power  sector  reform  are  (i)  the  constraints  of  absorptive  capacity  and  human\nresources  in  technical  and  commercial  fields,  (ii)  lack  of  a  human  resource  development\nprogram for the sector,  (iii)  weaker  initiative of  the  Government  to  corporatize  DOP  compared\nwith  hydropower  projects or  corporatization  of  other sectors  such  as  telecommunications,  and\n(iv) the Government\u2019s historical reluctance to increase tariffs.\n\n31.\nConsidering  the  human  resource  constraints  and  institutional  capacity,  it  has  been\nagreed to undertake a phased approach to sector reforms  supported  by  a  group  of  cascading\nTAs. Three TAs, namely Policy and Legal Framework for Power Sector Development approved\nin  1998,  and  Corporatization  of  DOP  and  Solicitation  of  Private  Sector  Participation  in\nHydropower Development planned in 1999 and 2001 respectively are therefore included in the\nBank\u2019s  country  assistance  program.  Under  these  TAs,  necessary  institutional  capability  for\ncommercialization of the sector will be created in a gradual and structured manner.\n\n32.\nAs  part  of  the  Institutional  and  Financial  Development  of  DOP  TA,  a  commercial\naccounting  system  was  created  for  DOP;  it  is  to  be  fully  implemented  when  DOP  is\ncorporatized.  In  the  meantime,  DOP  is  to  use  portions  of  the  system  concurrently  with  the\nexisting Government accounting system. However, two of the critical staff trained under the TA\nwere transferred to other Government departments, and the momentum for preparing to convert\nto  the  new  accounting  system  was  lost.  Under  the  proposed  Project,  the  Government  has\nagreed to appoint one dedicated project manager and at least two financial/accounting officers\nto implement and expand the commercial accounting system. As a result of the earlier problems\nand  to  ensure  that  the  Government  takes  ownership  of  the  TA  to  develop  a  policy  and  legal\nframework for power sector development7, the Bank insisted that DOP establish  a counterpart\nsteering  committee and  a  working  group  for  the  TA  prior  to  the  commencement  of  consulting\nservices.8\n\n                                                       \n6 TA  2912-BHU:      Second Rural Electrification Project,  for    $600,000,    approved  on  19  November  1997  and\nTA 3112-BHU:    Policy  and  Legal  Framework  for  Power  Sector  Development,  for  $500,000  approved  on\n15 December 1998.\nTA  3112-BHU:    Policy  and  Legal  Framework  for  Power  Sector  Development,  for  $500,000  approved  on\n15 December 1998.\nThe  committee  comprises nine members drawn  from  MTI,  DOP,  Ministry of  Finance,  Planning  Commission,  and\nthe High Court. The working group comprises four representatives from DOP and one representative from MTI.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\nThe  Bank\u2019s  ongoing  rural  electrification  project  is  delayed  by  approximately  one  year\n33.\nbecause  of  (i)  lack  of  submission  of  bids  from  international  bidders;  (ii)  delayed  transport  of\nmaterials  and  equipment  due  to  geographical  difficulties;  (iii)  insufficient  experience  of  local\ncontractors;  and  (iv)  force  majeure  due  to  heavy  rain  in  1998.  Despite  the  difficulties,  these\nobstacles  have  been  overcome.  DOP  determined  the  optimum  contract  sizes  that  will  attract\ninternational  bidders,  and  established  logistics  such  as  stores  functions  in  several  districts.\nA suitable organizational setup has been established in DOP to supervise implementation work\nin  remote  districts  in  association  with  district  offices.  DOP  confirmed  that  it  will  maintain  the\nsame organization and facilities with necessary strengthening for the proposed Project.\n\nE. \n\nThe Bank\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nThe Bank\u2019s sector strategy is integrated into the country strategy for Bhutan and aims to\n34.\nestablish  sustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  Bhutan  is  endowed  with  large\nhydropower resources. Expansion of hydropower generation capacity has supported the growth\nof electricity-intensive industries in recent years. Similarly, revenue from power export has been\nable  to finance  the  rapid expansion of social  services.  To  realize  the  sustainable  operation  of\nthe  power  sector,  the  Bank\u2019s  key  concerns  are  (i)  the  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  by\ncorporatizing  DOP,  and  enacting  laws  on  national  energy  policy  and  regulation;  (ii)  tariff\nadjustment based on full cost recovery of the power supply;  (iii) human  resource development\nfor  the  corporatized  DOP;  (iv)  commercialization  of  the  sector;  and  (v)  private  sector\nparticipation especially in hydropower generation for the midterm, which will be for power export\nto India.\n\nAs  part  of  this  strategy,  the  Bank  approved  its  first  loan  to  the  power  sector  for  Rural\n35.\nElectrification  in  1995  together  with  a  Bank  TA  for  Institutional  and  Financial  Development  of\nDOP  (footnote  2).  This  has  provided  an  impetus  for  sector  reform.  The  Bank  will  continue  to\nfocus  on  institutional  development  of  DOP  as  well  as  the  power  sector,  commercialization,\nprivate sector participation, and tariff structure adjustment to reflect the economic cost of power\nsupply. The Bank\u2019s continuous support for the power sector, including the proposed Project will\nrequire compliance with the agreed sector reforms, such as implementation of the agreed action\nplan for corporatization of DOP and domestic tariff adjustment.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36.\nSince  1993,  the  Bank  has  played  a  pioneering  role  and  provided  a  driving  force  for\npower  sector  reform  in  Bhutan  as  the  lead  multilateral  financing  institution.  As  a  result  of\nagreements reached in the earlier project, the Government increased tariffs in 1 April 1995, from\nNu0.4 to Nu0.5 per kWh (a 25 percent increase) and on 1 July 1997, from Nu0.5 to Nu0.6 per\nkWh (a 20 percent increase). Further in March 1998, the Government agreed to a  time-bound\naction  plan  for  sector  reform.  This  includes  (i)  implementation  of  the  tariff  structure\nrecommended  by  the  Bank  TA  (footnote  2)  in  FY2001;  (ii)  ratifying  the  new  legislation  of  the\npower sector  in  FY2002 based  on  the  recommendation  of  another  Bank  TA  (footnote  7);  and\n(iii) gradual overall tariff increase to meet the agreed financial targets of the corporatized DOP\nby the end of FY2005. For the institutional development of DOP, it was agreed to (i) implement\na  full  commercial  accounting  system  in  2000;  (ii)  complete  the  asset  evaluation  by  2001;\n(iii) complete the registration of DOP as a  company  (per  the  Companies Act) by  FY2002.  The\nBank  will  assist  with  this  institutional  development  through  the  accompanying  TA  to  the\nproposed loan. The time-bound action plan reflecting the policy dialogue is given in Appendix 5.\n\n\f9\n\n1. \n\nLegal and Policy Framework\n\n37.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  such  as  an\nelectricity act and its appropriate subsidiary legislation is necessary for sector development and\nregulation.  The  Government  has agreed  to  segregate utility operation  from  policy  making  and\nregulation  to ensure an efficient  and  financially  viable  sector  structure  and  grant  autonomy  to\nthe corporatized DOP. After new legislation for the power sector is established with the Bank\u2019s\nassistance,  DOP  will  be  transformed  from  a  Government  division  into  an  autonomous  and\nfinancially  viable  corporate  entity,  and  the  Government\u2019s  role  will  be  reduced  to  that  of  a\nregulator and a policymaker. Such a sector structure with transparent administrative tariff setting\nwill help to ensure the financial viability of the sector. The new legislation will be ratified by the\nend  of  FY2002  prior  to  the  corporatization  of  DOP.  The  Government  also  agrees  that  a\ntransparent  administrative  tariff  adjustment  scheme  will  be  implemented,  such  as  tariff\nadjustment to foreign currency fluctuation and domestic inflation. Under such a tariff adjustment,\nthe Government will consider approving DOP\u2019s proposal on tariff adjustment within a reasonable\nperiod in accordance with the new legislation for the power sector.\n\n2. \n\nCorporatization of DOP and Human Resource Development\n\n38.\nThe  DOP\u2019s  present  financial  and  accounting  system  follows  a  government  budget\nsystem.  Thus,  as  the  first  step  of  the  action  plan  under  the  institutional  and  financial\ndevelopment  TA  (footnote  2),  DOP  implemented  a  pilot  commercial  accounting  system  to\nseparate its accounting system from that of the Government.  The  Government  will  commence\nimplementing the full commercial accounting system as per the agreed action plan. In addition,\nthe  institutional  capability  of  engineering  fields  such  as  the  creation  of  master  plans,  system\nplanning, investment standards, and technical standards will be established in DOP prior to its\ncorporatization.\n\nThe requirement for human resource development for a corporatized DOP is substantial.\n39.\nThe  Bank  has  therefore  taken  the  initiative  to  bring  in  external  assistance  and  is  leading  aid\ncoordination on this matter. Along with the Bank\u2019s proposed TA for Corporatization of DOP, the\nGovernment of Austria  will  provide assistance for  technical training and  the  E-7  network/fund9\nwill  provide  expertise  on  utility  management  to  DOP.  The  Bank  has  previously  financed  the\nRoyal Institute of Management10 for overall human resource development in Bhutan. The Royal\nInstitute  has  confirmed  its  availability  and  cooperation  to  support  DOP\u2019s  human  resource\ndevelopment. Details of the current human resource development plan are given in Appendix 6.\n\n40.\nBecause of the constraints of human resources, institutional capability, and small system\nsize  of  the  power  sector  of  Bhutan,  a  simple  sector  structure  would  be  preferable.  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  in  principle  on  the  direction  proposed  by  the  Bank  for  corporatizing\nDOP. However, the Government feels that electricity supply in Bhutan has the characteristic of a\nbasic social service. In addition, the power sector, especially hydropower generation is expected\nto play a significant role as a major export industry. Therefore, the Government will always have\na role in the power sector and recognizes that its role as an operator needs to  be  segregated\nfrom that as a regulator.\n\n                                                       \n9 The E7 network is the nonprofit organization to assist sustainable development of the power sector in developing\n\ncountries. It comprises eight major utilities in G7 countries.\n\n10 The Royal Institute  of  Management  was  established  in  1986  and completely  restructured in  1997, funded  by the\nBank  (Loan  1035-BHU:   Technical and Vocational Education and  Training),  for  $7.13  million,  approved  on\n27 September 1990.\n\n\f10\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  aim  is  that  all  major  hydropower  projects  be  planned  as  separate\n41.\nentities.  It  is  therefore  logical  for  DOP  to  be  structured  as  the  national  transmission  and\ndistribution power utility with small hydropower and diesel generators. In such a structure, DOP\nwill  generate  revenues  mainly from  wheeling  charges  and  domestic  electricity  distribution  and\nwill achieve the agreed financial targets with an overall electricity tariff at Nu1.0 per kWh and a\nwheeling  charge  of  about  Nu0.12/kWh  in  FY2005.  The  explicit  tariff  increase  will  be  decided\nafter  asset  evaluation  under  the  accompanying  TA  in  accordance  with  the  corporate  and\nfinancial structure of the corporatized DOP.\n\n3.\n\nTariff Adjustment\n\n42.\ntariff.\n\na. \n\nExport Tariff\n\nBhutan by  virtue of  its  export  of  power  has  two  tariffs,  an  export  tariff  and  a  domestic\n\nCHPC exports its power to India after satisfying domestic requirements,11 and the export\n43.\ntariff  is  determined  based  on  negotiations  between  the  two  governments.  The  agreement\nbetween Bhutan and India provides for a tariff revision every four years; however, in reality the\nadjustments have been made more frequently, within a 2- or 3-year period. A tariff adjustment\nwas  made  in  April  1997  from  Nu0.5  to  Nu1.0  per  kWh.  Following  the  latest  round  of\nnegotiations,  the  export  tariff  was  increased  from  Nu1.0  per  kWh  to  Nu1.5  per  kWh  as  of\n1 July 1999. It is evident that through the export of  power  to  India  the power  sector  in  Bhutan\nhas become financially viable as a whole and provides substantial revenues to the Government.\nWith  the  increase  in  export  tariff,  revenues  from  power  accounts  for  one  half  of  the  country\u2019s\ntotal revenue. The new hydropower projects under construction will also be oriented toward the\nexport  of  power to  India.  The  Government has a  strong  desire  to  establish  a  transparent  and\ncommercial  export  tariff  setting  for  the  future  hydropower  projects  under  study.  The  Bank\nintends to assist in this matter through a planned TA in 2001 for private  sector participation  in\nhydropower development.\n\nb.\n\nDomestic Tariff\n\nPrior to 1 July 1997, the Government adopted a simple, uniform tariff for all categories of\n44.\ncustomers in all districts in Bhutan. In the mid 1980s, the uniform tariff was Nu0.7 per kWh, and\nafter the commissioning of the Chhukha hydropower plant in 1987, due to excess power and its\nability to export power to India, the Government decided to reduce the domestic tariff to Nu0.4\nper  kWh.  Since  the  Bank\u2019s  first  power  project  in  1995,  the  Bank  recommended  that  the\nGovernment gradually increase the domestic tariff so as to  recover the  cost of  supply, and,  in\nthe  midterm  the  tariff  structure  should  be  rationalized.  Although  DOP  purchases  power  from\nCHPC  at  Nu0.30  per  kWh,  the  investment  costs  on  transmission  and  distribution  need  to  be\nrecovered. Therefore, the tariff was subsequently increased to Nu0.5 per kWh in 1995, and  to\nNu0.6 per kWh for urban and industrial customers in July 1997.\n\n45.\nThe current electricity supply in Bhutan is characterized by (i) low generation cost as the\ncost  of  CHPC  is  considered  as  the  generation  cost  for  the  domestic  market  because  DOP  is\npermitted to consume the output power of CHPC up to its full capacity; (ii) the current share of\nlow and medium voltage consumers, which are mainly residential and commercial consumers,\nis small, and CHPC has sufficient capacity to supply electricity to such consumers for more than\n30  years;  (iii)  further  investment  for  hydropower  generation  and  transmission  are  targeted\nmainly for export, and their cost recovery can  be achieved through the export tariff.\n                                                       \n11 Domestic consumption accounts for about 20 percent of CHPC total generation.\n\n\f11\n\nHowever, the domestic electricity tariff,  which  is  set  much  below  the  export  tariff,  is an\n46.\nopportunity loss for Bhutan. This applies particularly to those electricity-intensive industries that\nare largely oriented to the Indian market. Although there could be some added value to Bhutan\u2019s\neconomy (i.e., through additional employment and taxes) in providing electricity  at  the present\nlow  rates  to  such  industries,  the  gap  between  the  domestic  and  export  tariffs  needs  to  be\nreduced  to  mitigate  fiscal  losses  to  the  Government.  Furthermore,  as  the  industry  sector\nrepresents  about  80  percent  of  domestic  electricity  sales,  potential  opportunity  losses  to  the\nGovernment  and  hence  to  a  corporatized  DOP  could  be  substantial,  and  thus  cannot  be\nignored.\n\n47.\nFollowing the ongoing policy dialogue with the Bank since the last Fact-Finding Mission\nin February 1999, DOP submitted a proposal to the Government to increase the electricity tariff\nto  urban/industrial  consumers  to  Nu0.8/kWh.  Due  to  strong  resistance  from  industries,  at  the\nrequest  by  the  Government  the  Bank  provided  assistance  to  study  the  impact  of  the  tariff\nincrease on major industries. The study showed that one of the major industries, Bhutan Ferro\nAlloys Limited (BFAL), is not in a condition to absorb the tariff increase up to the proposed level\nthis  year.  Its  current financial  condition  is  not  healthy,  as  it  was  struck  by  natural  disasters  in\n1998. BFAL currently consumes about 50 percent of total industry consumption in the country.\nThe  Government  is  reluctant  to  increase  the  electricity  tariff  to  Nu0.8/kWh,  as  it  will  have\nsubstantial  negative  impact  on  industry,  particularly  at  a  time  when  it  wants  to  promote  the\ndevelopment of these industries. The Government further argues that the incremental revenues\nfrom  increasing  the  tariff  are  negligible  given  the  total  revenues  the  country  receives  from\npower,  and  that  the  only  advantage  from  the  point  of  view  of  these  industries  is  the  cheap\npower. The Government also pointed out that if the industries are subjected to such a high tariff\nincrease,  their  consumption  of  power  would  substantially  reduce  as  some  of  them  may  close\ndown,  thereby  further  reducing  the  volume  of  internal  power  sales  by  DOP.  The  Bank\nunderstands the Government\u2019s position, although it also pointed out that BFAL\u2019s weak financial\ncondition  is  merely  due  to  last  year\u2019s  unfortunate  incidents,  which  resulted  in  a  major  loss  of\ninventory.  Therefore,  to  give  more  breathing  space  to  BFAL,  the  Bank  proposed,  and  the\nGovernment  agreed,  to  increase  the  tariff  to  urban/industrial  consumers  from  Nu0.60/kWh  to\nNu0.70/kWh (an increase of 17 percent) as of 1 January 2000; the increase to Nu0.8/kWh will\nbe effective on 1 July 2001 (a further increase of 14 percent). Cabinet approval for these tariff\nadjustments was obtained on 24 August 1999.\n\n48. With  regard  to  rural  consumers,  the  Bank  agreed  to  maintaining  the  rural  tariff  at\nNu0.50/kWh in line with the socioeconomic and environmental objectives of electricity supply in\nthe rural areas. However, it remains concerned with the current geographical and uniform tariff\nscheme, where rural consumers pay a lower tariff, as this could undermine the financial viability\nof  the  Project,  which  caters  mainly  to  the  rural  areas.  The  Bank  pointed  out  that  a  large\npercentage of consumers of the current tariff scheme are relatively well off. Although at present,\nthe impact is not significant as consumers in rural areas represent a  very  small  percentage of\ntotal  electricity  consumption  (3  percent),  the  fact  that  the  Government  intends  to  increase\nelectrification  in  the  rural  areas,  could  affect  DOP's  financial  position  over  the  long  term.  The\ntariff study addressed this issue, and based on the result of the study and to ensure adequate\ncost recovery (while taking into account the Government\u2019s social objectives) is reflected  in  the\ntariff,  it  was  agreed  that  the  Government  will  introduce  a  two-part  tariff  for  high  and  medium\nvoltage  consumers  and  a  three-block  tariff  for  low  voltage  consumers.  The  high  and  medium\nvoltage  consumers  will  pay  energy  and  demand  charges.  The  low  voltage  consumers  will  be\ndivided into low-end, medium-end, and high-end consumers. Of the three blocks, the first block\ncontains  consumers  for  whom  a  social  rate  can  be  applied.  The  proposed  tariff  structure  will\nallow contribution to capital costs to be reflected in the rate and provides for cross subsidy to the\n\n\f12\n\npoor  who  consumed  minimal  electricity.  Based  on  the  survey  conducted  by  the  tariff  study,  a\nlifeline or social rate was recommended at 80 kWh per month. In this context, the Government\nagreed to implement the tariff structure by the end of FY2001.\n\nThe proposed tariff structure will also help DOP as it plans to become a corporate entity\n49.\nin the near future. Being an independent company separate from the Government\u2019s budgetary\nsystem, DOP will need to be financially self-sustainable, and thus tariffs need to be adjusted to\nenable  DOP  to  meet  its  financial  requirements.  Based  on  the  assumptions  taken,  for  DOP  to\nreach the financial targets  once  it  is  corporatized, the  overall average  tariffs and  the  wheeling\ncharge  will  have  to  be  gradually  increased  to  reach  Nu1.0  per  kWh  and  Nu0.12  per  kWh,\nrespectively by FY2005. The explicit tariff adjustments and wheeling charges will be determined\nonce the valuation of DOP assets is completed, currently planned for FY2001.\n\n4.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation in Hydropower Development\n\n50.\nUp  until  now,  the  Indian  Government  has  been  the  main  hydropower  development\nfinancier in Bhutan. However, it is perceived that the Indian Government has limited resources\nand  that  after  the  Tala  plant,  it  may  not  be  in  a  position  to  finance  further  projects.  The\nGovernment therefore recognizes that other foreign investment  will  be  required  to achieve  the\nplanned  investments  for  hydropower  development.  The  sector  requires  large  amounts  of\nfunding from bilateral, multilateral, as well as private sector sources. A policy and guidelines to\nattract  foreign  investments  for  hydropower  projects  needs  to  be  developed  based  on  the\nelectricity act. Therefore, in December 1998, the Bank approved a TA (footnote 7) to assist the\nGovernment in developing this act, which includes the policy and legal framework for the power\nsector, and private sector participation in the power sector, especially in hydropower projects.\n\n51.\nSuch policy and guidelines for private sector participation to be developed by 2001 will\ninclude  feasible  project  structures,  financing  schemes,  ownership  arrangements,  mitigating\ncurrency  convertibility  risks,  creation of  security  package,  issues on  taxation and  provision  for\nrisk sharing between the various parties. Under the TA, large foreign borrowing and investments\nwill  be  carefully  analyzed,  from  the  viewpoints  of  macroeconomy,  balance  of  payment,  and\nforeign  currency  reserves  of  Bhutan.  The  Government  and  the  Bank  will  maintain  close\ncooperation with the other aid agencies during the TA implementation.\n\n52.\nFurthermore,  the  Government  fully  recognizes  the  importance  of  transparent  and  fair\ncompetition  with  a  well-formulated  project  structure  for  solicitation  of  proposals  from  private\ndevelopers.  In  this  context,  the  Bank  agreed  to  provide  TA  to  establish  such  solicitation\nprocedures.  It  will \ninclude  preparation  of  solicitation/requests  for  proposal  documents\ncomprising  technical  and  financial  requirements,  power  purchase  agreement,  water  supply\nagreement, and other necessary documents to invite project developers for future  hydropower\nprojects  such  as  Mangdechhu  (funded  by  the  Government  of  Austria)  and  Punatsangchhu\n(funded by the Government of Japan).\n\n5. \n\nSustainable Rural Electrification\n\n53.\nDuring the Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY1987-FY1991), a rural electrification program using\nhydropower was formulated to cover most villages in Bhutan.  However,  due to  lack of finance\nand  human  resources,  the  actual  achievement  was  minimal  of  what  was  planned.  In  the\nSeventh  Plan  (FY1992-FY1997),  the  Government  gave  high  priority  to  the  remaining  rural\nelectrification and  intended  to  implement  rural  electrification on  a  realistic scale.  This  program\nwas delayed and is now expected to be completed in 1999 with Bank assistance. At the end of\n\n\f13\n\nFY1997, 39 towns  and  363  villages  were  electrified,  and  the  total  number  of  DOP  customers\nwas 30,321. The household electrification ratio was approximately 28 percent in FY1998.\n\n54.\nUnder  the  Eighth  Plan,  the  Government  intends  to  electrify  rural  households  in  17  of\n20 districts  of  Bhutan.  Most  of  the  areas  in  the  program  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  existing\n132-kilovolt (kV) and 66-kV transmission lines. However, because of the enlarged project area,\ngeographically  scattered  and  isolated  customers,  rural  electrification  only  by  the  transmission\nand  distribution  system  is  not  feasible  from  technical  and  financial  viewpoints.  Therefore,  the\nrural  electrification  program  in  the  proposed  Project  will  utilize  existing  generation  from\nmini/microhydropower  stations,  as  well  as  use  solar  panels  for  important  local  community\nfacilities in remote areas.\n\nUNDP has confirmed its assistance for  mini/microhydropower  plants  to  remote  villages\n55.\nusing a grant from the Government of Sweden and GEF in areas to be served by the Project.\nUNDP\u2019s consultants commenced their work in April 1999 and are expected to complete project\ndesign  in  December  1999.  The  transmission  line  plan  created  under  the  Bank  PPTA  was\nprovided to UNDP\u2019s consultants to identify suitable sites based on a least-cost analysis.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n56.\nAlthough  Bhutan  has  substantial  sources  of  clean  and  renewable  hydropower  energy\nand exports power to India, distribution of electricity throughout the country is still limited. By the\nend of FY1997, approximately 80 percent of the population, mainly in rural areas, did not have\naccess  to  electricity.12  Since  1981, the  Government,  has  addressed  balanced  regional  growth\nthrough community consultation and a participatory approach. Health services, construction and\nmaintenance of feeder and farm roads, and primary education have been decentralized. Local\ncommunities  (gewogs)  now  take  part  in  the  planning,  implementation,  and  management  of\nsocial infrastructure. To date, most rural communities have access to hospitals, primary schools,\nand  local  markets  in  their  communities,  but  many  of  these  facilities  lack  electricity.  The\ndevelopment of such social infrastructure for basic human needs has resulted in strong demand\nfor  electricity  in  rural  communities.  Rural  people  now  desire  electricity  to  be  provided  to  their\nhouseholds,  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  community  establishments.  The  Project  is  primarily\naimed at the poorer members of Bhutan\u2019s rural community, as more than two thirds of its direct\nbeneficiaries (69.8 percent) live below the estimated poverty line.13  The provision of electricity is\nexpected  to  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas  by  increasing  opportunities  for  employment  and\naccess to improved (through electrification) government services such as education and health.\nThe Project is also expected to have a positive impact on reducing  migration  to  the  cities  and\npopulation control.\n\n57.\nFuelwood  consumption  in  Bhutan  at  1.22  tons  per  capita  is  one  of  the  highest  in  the\nworld.  Fuelwood  accounts  for  approximately  77  percent  of  total  energy  consumption  and\nvirtually  all noncommercial  energy  consumption  as  forest  resources  provide  an  abundant  and\nreadily  available  source  of  energy.  This  increases  the  pressure  on  deforestation  in  Bhutan.\nCollecting  fuelwood  is  done  by  each  household,  with  an  estimated  labor  cost  of  Nu780  per\ncapita.  More  than  30  percent  of  household  owners  are  women;  they  will  benefit  substantially\n\n                                                       \n12  Loan  1375-BHU:    Rural Electrification Project,  for  $7.5  million,  was  approved  on  30  September  1995  with  the\n\npurpose of providing electricity to about 3,100 consumers in seven districts.\n\n13  Poverty  line  per  household,  Nu4,032  per  month,  is  derived  from  average  occupancy  per  house  (8)  times  the\n\nestimated poverty line per person (Nu504 per month).\n\n\f14\n\nfrom  rural  electrification  as  they  spend  more  time  in  their  households  and  hence  will  use\nimproved  lighting  and  any  household  appliances  more.  Electrification  of  rice  mills  and  other\ngrain and food processing facilities will also reduce women\u2019s workload in the home. In addition,\nusing  fuelwood  for  cooking  and  heating  causes  respiratory  diseases  among  women  and\nchildren  as  they usually  spend  longer  times  in  the  home  than  do  men.14  Based  on  the  PPTA\nsurvey findings, it is estimated that a 10 percent immediate decrease of fuelwood consumption\nwill be achieved due to the proposed Project, and electrification will gradually further decrease\nfuelwood consumption in the long term as usage of electric heaters and water heaters increases\nin Thimphu and other towns.\n\n58.\nUnder the  Government policy of  using  a  participatory  approach  for  rural  infrastructure,\nthe rural electrification program during the Eighth Plan (1998-2002) was created based on the\nconsensus of local communities. Close consultation with the beneficiary local communities was\nundertaken  during  the  technical  feasibility  study  and  socioeconomic  study  under  the  Bank\nPPTA.  To  maximize  the  development  impact  of  rural  electrification,  the  application  of  solar\npanels  in  local  community  centers  comprising  hospitals,  schools,  and  other  local  community\nfacilities is integrated in the Project based on other successful operations in Bhutan.\n\n59.\nAmong aid agencies, the  Bank  is  taking  a  lead  role  in  assisting  with  the  power  sector\nreform in the country. The Bank has maintained close consultation with UNDP/GEF, and other\nbilateral sources of aid, such as Austria.  The  Bank\u2019s  initiatives for  power  sector  reform  will  be\nenhanced by the three cascading TAs. The reform measures intend to commercialize the power\nsector by establishing transparent and accountable sector operation and an autonomous power\nutility.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  also  addressing  DOP\u2019s  human  resource  constraints  by\nintroducing  advanced  technology  such  as  supervisory,  control,  and  data  acquisition  system\n(SCADA),15 which will efficiently utilize qualified technical staff in DOP.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n60.\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Project  is  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  provide\nopportunities  for  cash-generating  business,  job  creation,  improvement  of  rural  life,  and\nstrengthening  education and  health  services  to  rural  people,  especially  low-income  groups,  in\nBhutan through electrification by locally generated hydropower from existing power stations and\nsolar  panels.  Women  will  also  be  major  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  as  over  30  percent  of\nhousehold  owners  in  the  country  are  women.  Provision  of  electricity  under  this  Project  will\ndirectly  improve  rural  life  and fully  support  other social  infrastructure  such  as  village  hospitals\nand  schools.  An  immediate  tangible  economic  benefit  is  reduced  expenditure  on  imported\nkerosene  and  to  a  small  extent  the  use  of  fuelwood.  In  the  long  term,  rural  electrification  will\nfurther reduce the use of fuelwood and decrease the pressure of deforestation. In addition, the\nProject will facilitate efficient human resource utilization of DOP by introducing a simple SCADA\nsystem for the planned corporatization of DOP.\n\n61.\nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  rural  electrification  program,  which  was  created\nduring  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan.  The  Project  will  provide  access  to  electricity  to  6,038\nconsumers  in  rural  villages  in  16  districts  (7  districts  in  the Western  Region,  4  districts  in  the\nCentral Region, and 5 districts in the Eastern Region). The number of consumers will increase\nby about 20 percent and the household electrification ratio will go up to about 33 percent. With\nthe applying of SCADA, approximately 20 scarce technical staff working in substations of DOP\ncan  be  transferred  to  other  urgently  necessary  fields.  The  Project  comprises  (i)  rural\n                                                       \n14 Respiratory infections accounted for roughly 20 percent of the patients treated in 1994.\n15 SCADA will be utilized for remote control of a power system.\n\n\f15\n\nelectrification  of  distribution  system  to  6,010  consumers  including  23  hospitals,  24  primary\nschools, and other public facilities for local communities; (ii) remote rural electrification in three\ndistricts including 4  schools, 4 hospitals,  and  20  other  local  community facilities  by  renewable\nenergy sources using solar  panels; and  (iii)  a  small-scale pilot SCADA  system for  substations\nclose to Thimphu. The detailed project description is given in Appendix 7.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\nThe  Project  represents  the  least-cost  solution  for  providing  electricity  to  selected  rural\n62.\nvillages  in  Bhutan  based  on  a  comparison  with  other  alternate  power  systems.  Based  on  the\nrural  electrification  master  plan,  rural  electrification  of  villages  is  to  be  accomplished  by  a\ndistribution network from the grid system to provide a reliable and sufficient supply to meet the\nforecasted  demand.  In  remote  villages,  where  electrification  by  a  distribution  system  is  not\nfinancially and technically feasible, solar panels were chosen to provide electricity to hospitals,\nschools, and other local community facilities to maximize their development impact.\n\nThe  design  of  the  distribution  network  considers  both  current  distribution  practices  in\n63.\nBhutan, lessons learned from the ongoing project, and cost-effective construction in accordance\nwith  international  practices.  The  design  includes  (i)  continuous  adoption  of  the  International\nElectrotechnical Commission standards for most electrical equipment and materials to facilitate\ninternational  competitive bidding  (ICB);  (ii)  improvement  of portability  of  heavy  equipment  and\nmaterials considering geographic difficulties; and (iii) least-cost application of 11 kV and 33 kV\ndistribution networks considering future load growth.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n64.\nThe  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $12.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  $10.0  million  in\nforeign  exchange  costs  (80  percent)  and  $2.5  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs\n(20 percent). The summary is in Table 3 and the details are given in Appendix 8.\n\nItem\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nTable 3:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Exchange\n\nBase Cost\nRE by distribution system\nRE by solar panels\nSmall-scale pilot SCADA\n\nSubtotal\nTax and duties\nPhysical contingency\nPrice contingency\nIDC and service charge\n\nTotal\n\n8.2\n0.1\n0.3\n8.6\n0.0\n0.9\n0.3\n0.2\n10.0\n\n2.1\n0.0\n0.0\n2.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.2\n0.0\n2.5\n\n10.3\n0.1\n0.3\n10.7\n0.0\n1.1\n0.5\n0.2\n12.5\n\nRE = Rural Electrification; SCADA = Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n\n65.\nThe project cost is in 1999 prices and provides for physical contingency (10 percent  of\nthe base cost) and price contingency (2.4 percent per annum for the foreign exchange cost and\n7.4  percent  per  annum  for  local  currency  cost).  The  Project  will  be  exempted  from  all  direct\ntaxes and duties in accordance with Government procedures for development projects.\n\n\fE. \n\nFinancing Plan\n\n16\n\nThe financing plan envisages all foreign exchange costs to be financed by the Bank loan\n\n66.\nand local currency costs to be financed by the Government, as shown in Table 4.\n\nSource\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nTotal Cost\n\nPercent\n\nTable 4:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\nLocal Currency\n\nBank\nGovernment\nTotal\n\n10.0\n0.0\n10.0\n\n0.0\n2.5\n2.5\n\n10.0\n2.5\n12.5\n\n80\n20\n100\n\n67.\nThe proposed Bank loan of $10 million equivalent will be from the Bank\u2019s Special Funds\nresources  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  a  1  percent  per\nannum  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The\nBorrower will be the Kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Organization\n\n68.\nThe Executing Agency of the Project will be DOP and after the corporatization of DOP,\nthe corporatized DOP. As has been the  practice  with  the existing  Project,  all  construction and\nerection work of the distribution network will be undertaken by DOP staff, supplemented by local\ncontract  laborers  as  well as  village  volunteers,  whose  village  will  be  electrified  by  the  Project.\nThe existing designated Rural Electrification Project Implementation Unit of DOP will continue to\nwork  on  the  proposed  Project  with  a  necessary  increase  in  staff  numbers.  Existing  available\nfacilities for the ongoing project such as computer equipment, vehicles, and warehouses will be\nused for the Project.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n69.\nThe project manager has already been appointed, and the Project will be  implemented\nover a four-year period. Bidding documents for ICB and international shopping packages have\nbeen  prepared  by  the  PPTA  consultants.  Procurement  of  equipment  and  materials  will  be\nphased into two groups to suit DOP\u2019s storage capacity and physical implementation  schedule.\nPhysical  implementation  will  commence  in  April  2001  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by\nSeptember 2003, six months before the anticipated loan closing in March 2004. The schedule is\nconsidered  realistic  as  logistics  and  the  project  implementation  unit  have  been  streamlined\nthrough the ongoing project. The detailed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 9.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n70.\nProcurement of necessary equipment and materials for the Project will be undertaken in\naccordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, which were revised in February 1999\nreflecting the  Bank\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy, and  mandatory use of the  Bank\u2019s  standard  bidding\ndocuments. Since ICB contracts as originally packaged under the ongoing Project did not attract\nany bidders, the size, packaging arrangement, and timing of contracts was carefully  reviewed.\nThe ICB contracts were arranged into six packages and  are  to  be  issued  in  the  same bidding\ndocument. Bidders will have the option to bid on any or all packages, thus assuring competition.\n\n\f17\n\nTentative contract packages are shown in Appendix 10. Supply contracts estimated to cost the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less,  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping  procedures.\nPackages with an estimated contract value of more than $500,000 will be procured through ICB.\nLocal  manufacturers  may  participate  in  bidding  on  the  contract  packages,  and  a  domestic\npreference scheme may be applied in accordance with the Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nOn 5 May 1999, the Bank approved advance procurement action in the interest of efficient and\nearly  implementation  of  the  Project.  It  was  clarified  with  the  Government  that  the  Bank\u2019s\napproval  of  advance  procurement  action  will  not  in  any  way  commit  the  Bank  to  approve  the\nProject subsequently or to finance the cost incurred. Experience under the existing Project has\nbeen good.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\n71.\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. As DOP is successfully implementing the ongoing  rural\nelectrification project in addition to more than 30 previous  rural  electrification  schemes,  limited\nconsulting services will be required for project implementation. The international consultant will\nassist DOP with procurement, detailed design, construction supervision, training on  the use  of\nnew equipment, and monitoring of project benefits. It is estimated that about 10 person-months\nwill  be  required.  DOP  will  provide  sufficient  counterpart  staff.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsulting  services  are  given  in  Appendix  11.  On  5  May  1999,  the  Bank  approved  advance\nrecruitment  action  in  the  interest  of  efficient  and  early  implementation  of  the  Project.  It  was\nclarified with the Government that the Bank\u2019s approval of advance recruitment action would not\nin any way commit the Bank to approve the Project subsequently or to finance the cost incurred.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement\n\n72.\nDisbursements under the Project  will  be  mainly for the  supply  of  goods and  consulting\nservices. Therefore, the Bank\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used\nfor disbursement purposes.\n\n6.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\n73.\nRegular progress reports will be prepared for the Project and submitted to the Bank on a\nquarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  problems  and\ndifficulties encountered, and summary of financial accounts for the Project, which will consist of\nproject  expenditures  during  the  period,  year  to  date,  and  total  to  date.  A  project  completion\nreport  will  be  submitted  to  the  Bank  within  three  months  after  completion  of  the  Project.\nSeparate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  the  Project  by  DOP.  Within  the  nine  months  of  the\nclose of the financial year, detailed annual project accounts audited by an auditor acceptable to\nthe  Bank  will  be  submitted.  In  addition,  after  corporatization  of  DOP  in  FY2002,  financial\nstatements of the corporatized DOP, consisting of an income statement, balance sheet, and a\nstatement on sources and application of funds, audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank will\nbe submitted within nine months of the close of the financial year. DOP has generally been in\ncompliance with the covenants on audited financial statements.\n\n\f18\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1. \n\nOrganization of DOP\n\nThe  existing  organization  of  DOP  reflects  its  responsibility  for  a  portion  of  the  electric\n74.\npower  assets  of  the  Government  from  generation  to  distribution  except  for  CHPC.  Regarding\nthe  Tala  Hydropower  Project  Authority  and  the  Kurichhu  Project  Authority,  although  they  are\nseparate entities, DOP seconds its staff to them for their engineering and contractual works, as\nwell as monitoring of  their  physical  implementation.  DOP operates and  maintains  small power\nplants and 66 kV, 33 kV, 11 kV, and low voltage systems including service connections under\nthe direct guidance of MTI. Because DOP is part of the Government, although technical matters\nare  handled  by  DOP,  all  administrative  and  financial  matters  are  supervised  by  the\nAdministrative and Finance Division of MTI.  Overall planning of the power sector is undertaken\nby  DOP  in  consultation  with  other  concerned  ministries.  Approved  investment  plans  are\nconveyed to DOP for execution. All budgetary allocations are channeled from MOF through MTI\nto DOP. DOP collects revenues from the sale of electricity to residential consumers and remits\nthe entire amount to the Government. DOP is also governed by the Bhutan Civil Service Rules\n(1990)  on  recruitment,  pay  scales,  incentives,  promotions,  and  fringe  benefits  as  well  as\npensions and insurance.\n\nDOP  is divided  into  two  wings,  O&M,  and  Projects  and  Investigations.  The  O&M  wing\n75.\nhas  responsibility  for  the  maintenance  and  construction  of  transmission  and  distribution\nnetworks, as well as mini/microhydropower plants located in the different districts together with\ntheir associated distribution  networks  in electric  supply units  and  subunits.  Although  the  O&M\nwing does not have responsibility for the microhydropower plants that are operated by the local\ndistricts, it is providing necessary assistance for their maintenance and repair. The Projects and\nInvestigations  wing  is  responsible  for  monitoring  implementation  of  projects  and  assisting  the\nGovernment in project negotiations. The DOP organization chart is in Appendix 12.\n\n76.\nIn  October  1993,  the  Government  transferred  certain  assets  and  staff  of  DOP  to  local\ngovernment  units  to  improve  O&M  and  customer  service  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s\ndecentralization policy. This resulted in the transfer of all microhydropower generation assets to\nthe  districts,  which  were  made  responsible  for  their  O&M.  In  addition,  the  power  distribution\nassets and the staff of DOP associated with the electric supply units of Gelephu and Samdrup\nJongkhar in the Eastern Region, and Samtse in the Western Region, as well as electric supply\nsubunits in Ha, were transferred to their respective districts. These districts are responsible for\nall billing and collection, and all administrative matters associated with power distribution. They\noperate as separate distribution entities receiving supply from locally installed microhydropower\nplants or from DOP through the grid.\n\nFor the future corporatization of DOP, the Bank has proposed that DOP be structured as\n77.\nthe national transmission and distribution company responsible for all the transmission activities\nin  and  out  of  the  country  and  the  distribution  activities  within  the  country.  With  this  sector\nstructure, DOP will control and plan all the power transmission and distribution activities, and at\nthe same  time  receive additional  revenues from  wheeling  charges from  export  of  power. As  it\nnow stands, with major transmission and distribution investments being planned throughout the\ncountry,  DOP  will  not  be  able  to  survive  with  only  domestic  electricity  revenues.  The\nrecommended  sector  structure  will  be  further  reviewed  and  rationalized  under  the  Bank\u2019s\nongoing TA.\n\n\f19\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Projection of DOP\n\n78.\nAs a division within the Government, DOP does not have a separate accounting system\nas all financial and administrative matters are handled and supervised by the Administrative and\nFinance Division of MTI. At present, DOP is responsible for collection of the domestic electricity\nrevenues  while  CHPC  is  in  charge  of  all  export  sales.  To  see  how  its  account  will  look  as  a\ncorporate  entity,  separate  from  the  Government  budgetary  system,  a  proforma  financial\nprojection  of  DOP  was  prepared.  The  projection  was  carried  out  for  1999  to  2010.  As  a\ncorporate  and  independent  entity,  DOP  will  have  to  be  financially  self-sustainable.  For  this\nreason, the Bank proposed and the Government agreed to achieve by the end of FY2005, three\nyears  after  DOP  is  fully  corporatized,  the  following  financial  covenants:  at  least  a  6 percent\nnominal rate of return on net revalued fixed assets, at least a 1.5 debt service ratio, at least a\n20 percent  self-financing  ratio,  and  a  maximum  debt-equity  ratio  of  60:40.  These  financial\ntargets are  considered  reasonable  considering  the  relatively  high  inflation  and  savings  rate  in\nBhutan of about 6.5 to 7.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. A summary of DOP\u2019s financial\nprojection is provided in Table 5, and the details and assumptions are provided in Appendix 13.\n\nTable 5: DOP\u2019s Financial Projection\n(Nu Million)\n\nItem\n\nFY1999 FY2001 FY2003 FY2005 FY2007\n\nFY2010\n\nDomestic Sales (GWh)\nPower Export Wheeled (GWh)\nEnergy Sources (GWh)\nSystem Losses\n\nEnergy Cost (Nu/kWh)\nAvg Domestic Tariff (Nu/kWh)\nWheeling Charges (Nu/kWh)\n\n400.0\n\n419.0\n\n417.6\n9.0%\n\n0.30\n0.60\n\n460.4\n9.0%\n\n0.32\n0.69\n\n461.9\n1,895.0\n2,441.2\n9.0%\n\n509.2\n4,237.2\n4,883.4\n9.0%\n\n0.37\n0.85\n0.11\n\n0.43\n1.00\n0.12\n\n561.4\n6,460.8\n7,209.6\n9.0%\n\n0.49\n1.13\n0.13\n\n649.9\n7,110.4\n7,969.7\n9.0%\n\n0.60\n1.48\n0.14\n\nOperating Revenues\n\n238.8\n\n291.0\n\n595.1\n\n1,017.7\n\n1,468.7\n\n1,977.8\n\nOperating Expenses\nNet Operating Profit\nInterest Expenses\nForeign Exchange Losses\nIncome Tax\nNet Profit\n\nGross Fixed Assets\nDepreciation\nNet Fixed Assets\nConstruction in Progress\nTotal Assets\nLiabilities\nEquity\n\nRate of Return\nDebt Service Ratio\nSelf Financing Ratio\nDebt : Equity Ratio\n\n265.8\n(27.0)\n24.9\n-\n\n314.7\n(23.7)\n34.1\n25.0\n\n569.9\n25.2\n235.8\n44.8\n\n671.7\n346.0\n238.2\n43.3\n\n(51.9)\n\n(82.8)\n\n(255.4)\n\n64.4\n\n1,850.9\n605.0\n1,245.9\n1,412.3\n2,724.6\n1,081.8\n1,642.7\n\n-1.8%\n0.7\n-8%\n33 : 67\n\n2,558.8\n845.3\n1,713.5\n3,285.8\n5,050.7\n2,287.9\n2,741.9\n\n-1.3%\n0.7\n-5%\n46 : 54\n\n6,098.3\n1,284.8\n4,813.5\n2,090.2\n7,027.3\n2,990.6\n4,037.7\n\n0.6%\n0.7\n-16%\n45 : 55\n\n7,979.9\n1,923.6\n6,056.3\n2,595.9\n8,987.8\n3,519.8\n5,468.0\n\n6.0%\n1.5\n23%\n45 : 55\n\n758.0\n710.7\n210.4\n40.7\n137.9\n321.8\n\n9,170.4\n2,634.2\n6,536.2\n3,581.0\n11,086.2\n3,548.2\n7,537.9\n\n7.7%\n1.7\n46%\n41 : 59\n\n1,278.9\n699.0\n323.0\n33.9\n102.6\n239.4\n\n14,589.3\n4,541.2\n10,048.1\n2,725.8\n13,103.0\n3,100.7\n10,002.3\n\n6.0%\n1.7\n61%\n34 : 66\n\n\f20\n\nMajor  assumptions  in  preparing  the  above  financial  projections  include  (i)  DOP  being\n79.\nstructured  as  the  national  transmission  and  distribution  entity  for  the  country  beginning  in\nFY2002,  thereby  allowing  it  to  earn  wheeling  charges  for  the  service;  (ii)  energy  cost  for\ndomestic use remaining at the present level of Nu0.30/kWh, increasing by the domestic inflation\nrate only; and (iii) assumptions on the assets level and the planned investments. The financial\nprojections  show  that  in the  next few  years  and  during the early  years of  the formation of  the\ncorporatized DOP, the company will experience heavy losses as it will now have to account for\nits own depreciation and financing costs, and will receive no budgetary support. However, with\nthe  additional  revenues  from  wheeling  charges  being  earned,  particularly  when  power  supply\nfrom  the  Tala  plant  becomes  available  for  export  in  FY2005,  DOP\u2019s  financial  position  will\nimprove, and it is expected that it will be able to achieve the financial targets by FY2005. At this\ntime,  the  overall  domestic  tariffs  and  wheeling  charges  should  be  at  least  about  Nu1.0  and\nNu0.12  per  kWh,  respectively,  bearing  in  mind  that  these  tariff  levels  are  based  on  the  low\nenergy  supply  presumably  from  the  Chhukha  plant.  If  the  cost  of  supply  from  the  generation\ncompanies increases, DOP will need to pass the increased costs to its consumers. The explicit\ntariff  level  will  be  further  determined  once  the  registration  and  valuation  of  DOP\u2019s  assets  are\nfinalized in FY2001.\n\n80.\nThe  current  tariff  of  Nu0.6/kWh  and  even  the  proposed  rate  of  Nu0.7/kWh  are  not\nsufficient  to  cover  DOP\u2019s  costs.  Based  on  the  findings  under  the  institutional  and  financial\ndevelopment TA (footnote 2), the system average transmission and distribution cost for DOP to\nsupply  1  kWh  of  energy  in  the  country  is  approximately  Nu1.30  per  kWh.  At  present,  these\nlosses are  not  transparent  because  the  sector  as  a  whole  is  still  profitable  (80 percent  of  the\nenergy produced in the country is exported to India at Nu1.5 per kWh, and the cost to generate\nthis energy is less than Nu0.2/kWh). However, with the plan to corporatize DOP in the future, it\nis important to ensure that DOP will be financially self-sustainable and viable. Furthermore, as\nthe Government intends to increase electrification in the rural areas, which is not commercially\noriented, the Government will have to ensure that these marginal investments do not jeopardize\nDOP\u2019s  financial  condition.  Therefore,  DOP  will  need  to  continue  to  obtain  long-term,  low-cost\nfunding  for  this  type  of  investment.  Given  the  large  investments  in  the  energy  sector,  the\nGovernment will need to carefully review the sector to ensure fair distribution of charges to the\nusers to recover the investments.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\n81.\nIn view of the high reliance on fuelwood as a source of energy, the Government foresees\nbenefits to  accrue from  the  Project not  only  in  terms  of balanced  development  throughout  the\ncountry but also in a reduction of the rate of forest depletion. The Project is expected to have a\nsignificant positive impact on the reduction of demand for fuelwood in the long term. Under the\nPPTA, as part of  the feasibility study for  the  Project, an  initial  environmental  examination  was\nprepared and a summary is presented in Appendix 14. The Project is classified as category B,\nand a detailed environmental impact assessment is not necessary.\n\n82.\nAs part of project feasibility, an intensive field survey was undertaken for distribution line\nrouting. Most of the distribution poles will run along the roadside and transformers will be pole-\nmounted. Apart from minor bush clearing along the road, no deforestation will take place. Based\non  the  survey,  the  Project  will  have  no  impact  on  any  rare  or  endangered  flora  and  fauna\nspecies  or  habitat.  There  will  be  no  discharge  of  polluting  materials,  given  the  nature  of  the\nProject. There are very few cultural features that fall within the project area, such as temples or\n\n\f21\n\nmonasteries. With  proper planning of the  route, none of the  cultural features  will  be  disturbed\nother  than  by  the  minor  visual  appearance  of  distribution  lines.  Because  most  erection  works\nare  associated  with  poles,  soil  erosion  and  silt  runoff  will  be  insignificant.  The  construction\nactivities of the Project will not have any significant impact on ecology.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures\n\na. \n\nTargetting the Poor\n\n83.\nThe Project, which targets the poorer areas of Bhutan, is the first of its kind in the Bank\nwhere the primary objective of poverty reduction is met by providing electricity to more than two\nthirds of project beneficiaries who live below the poverty line. It will improve the overall quality of\nlife  of  rural  people  and  reduce  poverty  by  improving  access  to  economic  and  social\nopportunities,  including  employment,  schools,  health  services,  and  other  social  as  well  as\ngovernment services. Women and children will benefit from  the Project  through  a  reduction of\nthe incidence of respiratory diseases and of women\u2019s daily chores of collecting fuel, which will\nrelease their time and energy for more productive and socially beneficial activities. Construction\nworks  under  the  Project  will  require  mostly  unskilled  labor  and  will  generate  direct  income-\nearning opportunities,  particularly for  the  poor.  It  is estimated  the  Project  will  provide  115,000\nperson-days of unskilled employment  opportunities  over  a  period of three and one  half  years.\nDuring  the  implementation  phase,  DOP  will  make  the  service  connections  to  the  poor\nhouseholds a priority. The poor households will be identified by DOP through consultations with\ncommunity representatives, village leaders, and district administrations.\n\nb. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n84.\nThe  Project  will  require  minimal  land  acquisition  for  the  erection  of  transformers  and\npoles.  There  will  be  no  involuntary  population  resettlement.  As  agreed  with  the  Government,\nattention  will  be  given  to  establishing  firm  commitments  for  financing  land  acquisition  well  in\nadvance of construction to ensure that delays in construction works do not occur. Compensation\nin  cash  will  be  provided  by  the  Government  to  the  owners  for  crops  and  trees  located  in  the\nright-of-way of the erected poles. Bhutan has some ethnic minority groups such as Doya, Laya\nLingzi,  Merak  Sektang,  and  Yak  herders,  who  constitute  less  than  0.2  percent  of  the  total\npopulation.  Since  the  minority  people  live  in  areas  that  will  not  be  covered  by  the  Project,  a\nminority people development plan is not required. Land acquisition was satisfactorily carried out\nfor ongoing project without any disputes.\n\nc.\n\nParticipatory Project Performance Monitoring System\n\n85.\nA project performance monitoring system will be set up under the Project in association\nwith  DOP.  Regular feedback  will  be provided by  the  project  implementation  units  to  the  Bank\nregarding  the  effectiveness  of  the  Project  and  any  necessary  changes  that  may  be  required\nduring implementation. Regular monitoring reports will be included in quarterly reports prepared\nby DOP.\n\n86.\nDOP will monitor the project benefits to enable postevaluation of the Project, and also to\nimprove the  planning  of future  rural  electrification  projects.  The  proposed  project  performance\nevaluation  and  measurement  indicators  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Project Performance Management System.  DOP  will  establish,  in  consultation\nwith  the  Bank,  a  set  of  performance  indicators  and  performance  targets  to  monitor  project\nbenefits at the time of loan inception.\n\n\f22\n\nThe  Bank  expects  to  carry  out  a  power  sector  review  in  2002.  As  part  of  the  review,\n87.\nconsultants  will  conduct  comprehensive  social  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation  before  and\nafter  completion  of  the  Project  to  determine  (i)  the  total  number  of  connected  consumers  in\nvarious  categories,  number  of  total  potential  consumers  in  those  categories  resident  in  the\nthose  categories  at  various  dates  after\nservice  area,  and  the  connection  ratios  for \ncommissioning; (ii) average consumption rates for consumers in each category; (iii) description\nof new economic activities induced by the  introduction of  electricity;  (iv)  description of existing\neconomic  activities  that  have  switched  to  using  electricity  and  thereby  become  more  efficient\nand  productive;  (v)  estimated  total  value  of  economic  activities  induced  by  the  rural\nelectrification;  (vi)  estimate  of  average  income  levels;  and  (vii) survey  of  the  perceived\nimportance  of  various  types  of  benefits  created  by  rural  electrification,  such  as  improved\nemployment  opportunities,  increased  income  levels,  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure\nactivities,  and  improved health  standards.  It  will  also  carry  out  concurrent  surveys  of  average\nincome  levels  in  some  representative  and  comparable  communities  that  are  not  electrified  to\ndetermine  the  incremental  impact  of  rural  electrification  on  income  levels  and  economic\nactivities. In addition, the consultants will conduct monitoring and evaluation of land acquisition\nactivities,  entitlements,  time  frames,  and  budget  set  out  for  this  process.  A  social  impact\nanalysis of the Project is presented in Appendix 15.\n\nI. \n\nGovernance\n\n88.\nThe Bank\u2019s operations in Bhutan are clearly addressing improvement of governance of\nthe power sector of Bhutan as well as of DOP. For the governance of the overall power sector,\nthe Bank is providing assistance for the policy and legal framework of the power sector, through\nwhich  utility  operation  will  be  clearly  segregated  from  policy  making  and  regulation,  and\nespecially transparency and accountability of the tariff setting will be established. In addition, the\nBank  is assisting  DOP  to  implement  a  commercial  accounting  system  through  its  TAs  for  the\ntransparent  costing,  efficient  and  sustainable  operation  of  DOP,  along  with  institutional\nstrengthening  in  the  technical  fields.  It  will  also  enhance  the  corporate  governance  of  DOP.\nFurthermore, the proposed Project was formulated following the participatory approach from the\nplanning stage to the feasibility study stage. Such a participatory approach will also be followed\nduring implementation.\n\nJ. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n89.\nTo assist DOP\u2019s transition from a Government division to a corporation, an advisory TA\naccompanying  the present  loan  will  be  provided  to  the  Government  for  the  Corporatization  of\nDOP.  The  major  works  will  include  (i)  conducting  asset  registration  and  valuation  of  DOP  by\nqualified international asset appraisers; (ii) formulating a recommendation on asset and liability\nand  equity  structures  and  other  financial  arrangement  to  ensure  financial  viability  of  the\ncorporatized DOP; (iii) establishing tariff adjustment based on the  long-run  marginal  costs and\non  the  financial  projection  of  the  corporatized  DOP;  (iv)  facilitating  registration  of  the\ncorporatized  DOP  including  preparation  of  necessary  documents  as  a  company  such  as\nmemorandum and articles of association as per the power sector legislation and companies act;\n(v)  formulating  the  organizational  structure  of  the  corporatized  DOP,  such  as  delegation  of\npowers,  job  description,  necessary  human  resources,  salary  and  fringe  benefit  structure,\nrecruiting policy, etc.; (vi) finalizing a human resource development program, which is necessary\nfor the corporatization of DOP in association with other aid agencies and in consultation with the\nBank;  and  (vii) providing  the  necessary  training  on  commercial  accounting,  corporate  and\nfinancial management, and  tariff  setting  methodology to  DOP\u2019s  staff  by  using training  courses\navailable  at  the  Royal  Institute  of  Management  as  a  subcontractor  to  the  selected  consulting\n\n\f23\n\nfirm.  About  20  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  necessary.  The\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will\nbe  financed  by  the  Bank  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan. Terms of reference and cost estimates are indicated in Appendix 16.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n1. \n\nLoad Forecast\n\nThe  PPTA  household  survey  results  from  nonelectrified  and  electrified  households\n90.\nindicate that the preparedness of consumers and their willingness to pay for electricity is high.\nThe  response  from  the  non-electrified  consumers  as  to  the  level  of  monthly  bill  they  are\nprepared to pay (average of Nu200 per month from purely domestic consumers) suggests both\nthe willingness to pay a higher tariff and relatively high consumption levels for rural areas.16 The\naverage consumption by the project beneficiaries is expected to range from 80 to 120 kWh per\nmonth  as  most  of  the  beneficiaries  will  fall  under  the  lifeline  consumption.17  Most  of  the\ncommercial  activity \nto  house-and-shop  residences.  The\nis  restricted \nvillage industries,  mainly comprising small rice, flour, and saw mills, are  expected to  convert to\nelectricity (motor-driven), from their diesel-driven systems. Considering the domestic market and\nthe current status of commercial activities in the rural areas, modest growth for such industries\nis expected.\n\nthe  villages \n\nin \n\n91.\nThe load forecast for domestic consumers in rural areas considers an overall growth of\n3 percent  per  annum,  commensurate  with  the  population  growth  (2.4  percent)  for  the  next\n10 years. Beyond this period, the forecasted load was assumed to remain constant. Potential for\nhigher consumption still exists, if proper and strict steps are taken to prevent excessive use of\nfirewood for room heating, thereby conserving forest resources.\n\n2. \n\nAbility and Willingness to Pay\n\n92.\nThe  survey  results  have  indicated  the  consumers\u2019  willingness  and  ability  to  pay.  The\namount spent on fuel in nonelectrified villages and on electricity in electrified villages is very low\ncompared with the total expenditure or income. The willingness to pay can also be gauged from\nthe response of the  surveyed households,  with  most  (95 percent)  respondents  indicating  their\nwillingness  to  pay according  to  the billed  amount.  The  survey  also  indicated  that  the  villagers\nare keen to have electricity and are ready to pay for the initial cost of house wiring and the initial\ndeposit.\n\n                                                       \n16\n\n17\n\nThe figure may be due more to their  eagerness  to  obtain  electricity,  rather than the  actual  payment  that  they are\ngoing  to  spend,  as  the  survey  also  showed  that  the  consumption  level  of  the  poor  households  in  rural  areas  is\nusually quite low.\nAs recommended under the Bank\u2019s TA for institutional and financial development (footnote 2), completed in March\n1997, a lifeline consumption block is set at 80 kWh per month, a middle block up to 200 kWh per month, and a third\nblock over 200 kWh per month.\n\n\f24\n\n3. \n\nLeast-Cost Alternative\n\n93.\nThe  Project  represents  the  least-cost  solution  for  supplying  electricity  to  the  project\nareas in a reliable manner to meet the expected demand. It includes a combination of grid-fed\nservices  and  some  isolated  community-based  solar  systems.18  The  source  of  supply  for  the\nschemes  is  mainly  indigenous  hydropower.  Power  from  these  sources  will  be  brought  to\nconsumers  through  extensions  of  the  existing  transmission  and  distribution  network.  The\nalternative with diesel power generation for the project areas is not considered viable, due to the\ndifficulty with transportation in certain terrain, and the fact that  the fuel  cost and  O&M  cost for\nthe  diesel  alternative  would  be  costlier  compared  with  the  network  extensions.  Further,  the\nproposed  transmission  and  distribution  extensions  enable  future  expansion  and  can  fit  in  the\noverall  master  plan  for  rural  electrification.  Some  centers  of  local  communities  can  not  be\nelectrified  by  the  network  expansion,  although  they  comprise  schools,  hospitals,  and  other\npublic facilities. For such local centers, electrification by solar panels or mini/microhydropower is\napplicable.  Under  the proposed Project,  solar  panels  will  be  applied  to  three  local  community\ncenters as the least-cost alternative.\n\n4. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis\n\nBenefits  of  the proposed Project have  been  estimated  in  terms  of  nonincremental  and\n94.\nincremental  benefits  based  on  Bank  guidelines.  For  residential  and  nonindustrial  consumers,\ntheir  nonincremental  benefit  is  estimated  by  resource  cost  savings  (about  80  percent  of  total\nload forecast), i.e., cost savings from the substitution of kerosene by electricity for lighting, and\nthe incremental benefit for the new market (representing about 20 percent of load forecast) by\nwillingness to pay, i.e., the benefit of increased consumption because of the availability of lower\ncost  electricity.  For  the  industrial/commercial  consumers,  or  those  motive  power  users,  their\nwillingness  to  pay  is  estimated  by  the  cost  (capital  and  O&M  cost)  of  self-generation  from  a\ncaptive diesel  plant.  The Project  will  start accruing benefits progressively from  FY2001 as  the\n16 districts in the rural areas are being electrified, and  the full benefits  will  be  in  FY2003.  The\nproject  economic  internal  rate  of  return  based  on  this  approach  was  calculated  to  be  about\n13 percent,  as  compared  with  the  10  percent  discount  rate  for  Bhutan.  Further  details  of  this\nanalysis are given in Appendix 17. The sensitivity analysis shows that despite  the  high  capital\ncost,  the  relatively  low  electricity  consumption  and  the  large  gap  between  the  export  and\ndomestic  tariff, the  Project  remains  economically  viable.  There  would have  to be  more  than  a\n14 percent  increase  in  cost  for  the  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  fall  below\n10 percent. Similarly, there has to be at least a 12 percent decline in benefits for the net present\nvalue  to  fall  to  zero.  This  provides  sufficient  cushion  to  guard  against  any  fluctuation  in  the\neconomic  growth  rate.  Without  the  Project,  the  alternative  would  be  to  maintain  the  high\nkerosene  and  diesel  oil  consumption,  all  of  which  are  imported  from  India,  and  in  the  longer\nterm, the use of fuelwood. The nonquantifiable benefits of the Project are (i) improvement of the\nlivelihood  of  the  people  in  the  rural  area,  (ii) provision  of  opportunities  for  cash-generating\nbusiness,  and thus promoting  economic  development,  (iii) reduction  of  the  use  of  fuelwood  in\nthe long term, which is hazardous to the health of the people, (iv) decrease in the pressure of\ndeforestation,  and  (v) assistance  to  improve  functioning  of  social  and  public  infrastructure\nfacilities such as hospitals and schools.\n\n95.\nGiven the nature of the Project, which caters mainly to poor rural consumers, the Project\nis  financially  marginal  (financial  rate  of  return  is  negative)  as  its  investment  cost  is  not  fully\ncompensated by the financial gain from the output. The tariff in the rural areas is also expected\n                                                       \n18\n\nThe  least-cost  analysis  is  further  complemented  by  the  proposed  UNDP/GEF-assisted  mini/micro  hydropower\nplants to remote villages.\n\n\f25\n\nto  rise  more  slowly  than  urban  and  industrial  tariffs.  The  Project  largely  represents  the  social\nobligation of the Government to its people. Therefore, the Government has to make sure that it\nwill not adversely affect DOP\u2019s financial performance, especially once DOP is corporatized and\nbecomes an independent entity. In this case, the Government agreed to ensure that DOP would\nachieve the financial targets (minimum 6 percent rate of return on net fixed assets, debt service\nratio of 1.5, and  self-financing  ratio  of  20  percent)  through  necessary  tariff  adjustments.  DOP\nonce corporatized will be able to meet these financial targets from FY2005 onward.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nThe  Government \n\nis  addressing  environmental  concerns  and  maintaining  strict\n96.\nregulations to preserve a minimum 60 percent of the forest covering the total land area. In view\nof the high reliance on fuelwood as a source of energy in households, the Government foresees\nbenefits to  accrue from  the  Project not  only  in  terms  of balanced  development  throughout  the\ncountry  but  also  in  a  reduction  of  the  pressure  of  deforestation  in  the  long  term.  Fuelwood\nconsumption  in  rural  areas  will  be  gradually  replaced  by  electricity,  which  is  indigenously\ngenerated from hydropower stations.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimension\n\n97.\nThe surveys conducted under the PPTA were undertaken using a participatory approach\nand  included a  socioeconomic  survey  of  over  466  households  in  electrified  and  nonelectrified\nvillages.  During  fact-finding,  full  consultations  with  stakeholders  were  carried  out  involving\ncommunities, particularly  the  rural poor.  Several  meetings  were  held  in  the  project  areas  with\nnongovernment  organizations,  community-based  organizations,  and  members  of  civil  society\norganizations.  A  social  impact  assessment  was  carried  out  and  a  summary  is  included  in\nAppendix 15.\n\n98.\nProvision of electricity under this Project will directly improve the quality of life for 5,437\nrural households. The immediate tangible economic benefit is reducing expenditure on imported\nkerosene and to a smaller extent the use of fuelwood. It has been estimated that a 10 percent\nimmediate  decrease  in fuelwood  consumption  will  be achieved as a  result of  the  Project.  The\nProject  also  provides  electricity  to  public  facilities  such  as  health  centers,  schools,  and  other\npublic  facilities  for  local  communities.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  increase  the  overall  level  of\neconomic and social well-being of Bhutan\u2019s rural population.\n\n99.\nRural electrification will especially improve the living conditions of women and children.\nElectrification reduces the incidence of respiratory diseases among women and children as they\nusually  stay  in  the  house  longer  than  do  men.  The  Project,  for  instance,  will  benefit  women\nsubstantially by reducing women\u2019s daily chore of collecting fuelwood. Reducing women\u2019s burden\nof  collecting  fuelwood  would  release  their  time  and  energy  for  more  productive  and  socially\nbeneficial activities. In addition,  electrification of  ricemills and other  grain  mills  as  well as food\nprocessing facilities also reduces women\u2019s workload.\n\n100.\nIn  addition  to  direct  enhancement  of  household  welfare,  policy  objectives  of  rural\nelectrification  emphasize  social  impacts  of  the  overall  benefit  to  the  community.  The  use  of\nelectricity by community services and positive impacts on reduction of population growth, rural-\nurban migration, and modern lifestyle are usually expected to be substantial. Rural electrification\nwill be used by rural schools, and health clinics, and for street lighting and public buildings. The\n\n\f26\n\nfact  that  there  is  a  wider  range  of  goods  and  services  available  is  also  a  benefit  to  the\ncommunity. Less tangibly, the availability of electricity tends to provide rural communities with a\npsychological  boost  as  it  brings  them  into  active  contact  with  national  and  international\nperspectives (radio, television, Internet, etc.), thus  improving  the  moral  and  civic  pride of  rural\npeople.\n\n3.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nThe overall strategy of the Project for poverty reduction has been formulated in terms of\n101.\ntwo  approaches:  targeted  interventions  to  meet  the  basic  electricity  needs  of  the  poor  and\nbroadly  based  economic  growth  to  generate  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The\nProject  is  expected  to  reduce  rural  poverty  and  raise  living  standards  of  rural  communities\nthrough increased access to electricity.  The specific objectives are to (i) provide opportunity for\nincome-generating activities, (ii) generate employment through expansion of cottage and small\nindustries to mitigate rural poverty, (iii) improve the quality of rural life, and (iv) provide adequate\nand quality education and  health  services  to  rural  people, particularly  the poor  and  vulnerable\ngroups through the supply of hydropower-generated electricity from existing local power stations\nand solar panels.\n\n102. Approximately  6,038  customers  in  rural  villages  in  16  districts  will  be  provided  with\naccess to electricity. The poverty profile of  the  population affected  by the  Project  is  such,  that\n4,217  households19  or  more  than  two  thirds  (69.8  percent)  of  the  Project\u2019s  beneficiaries  live\nbelow the estimated poverty line level of Bhutan.20 During the implementation phase, DOP will\nprovide  the  service  connection  to  poor  households  as  a  first  priority.  Poor  households  will  be\nidentified  by  DOP  through  consultations  with  community  representatives,  village  leaders,  and\ndistrict  administrations.  In  addition,  construction  of  transmission  lines,  which  mostly  require\nunskilled labor, will generate direct income-earning opportunities, particularly for the poor. Over\nthree  and  one-half  years,  the  Project  will  provide  approximately  115,000  person-days  of\nunskilled employment opportunities, particularly for the poor.\n\n103.\nThe availability of electricity will become a stimulant to the creation of new rural industry\nand commerce. In Bhutan, agricultural processing is the main direct industrial productive use of\nelectricity in rural areas, e.g., grain grinding, flour milling, rice husking, and production of seed\noil. The productive use of electricity will increase employment opportunities and reduce rural to\nurban  migration.  Furthermore,  the  supply  of  electricity  to  the  lower  income  households  is\nexpected  to  enhance  their  income-earning  potential,  as  weaving  and  other  cottage  industry\nactivities can continue at night.\n\nC. \n\nRisks\n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Risks\n\n104. At the macroeconomic level, slower economic growth could result in growth of electricity\nsales lower than the assumed level. This would result in the project investment taking a longer\ntime  to  realize  full  benefits,  thereby  adversely  affecting  the  project  returns.  The  projected\n3 percent increase of demand is  sufficiently  lower  than  the  actual  increase  of  5 percent  of  the\n\n                                                       \n19 Based on the PPTA report, the average number of household members is eight.\n20 Since no documented information on the poverty line of Bhutan is available, its assessment has been based on the\nsame yardstick (primarily on food intake of 2,400 calories per person per day) as that followed in India, adjusted to\nconsider  nuances  relevant  to  Bhutan,  such  as  expenditure  on  transport,  shelter,  clothing,  fuel,  etc.  This  is\nestimated to be around Nu504 per person per month or $144 per capita per year (December 1998 price level).\n\n\f27\n\nload  growth  in  the  last  five  years.  Thus,  the  probability  of  even  lower  load  growth  is  not\nconsidered high.\n\n105.\nThe  risk  from  lower  than  assumed  tariffs  could  be  significant  for  DOP\u2019s  viability.\nHowever, the Government already provided  assurances  to  ensure  that  DOP  will  be financially\nsustainable,  and  that  it  will  achieve  the  financial  covenants  through  gradual  overall  tariff\nadjustment  and  introduction  of  the  three-block  tariff  to  low  voltage  customers  prior  to  the\ncorporatization  of  DOP.  Therefore,  the  average  tariff  for  low  voltage  customers  will  be  higher\nthan the overall tariff assumed for the evaluation of the Project. In this context, the probability of\ntariff  increases  falling  significantly  lower  than  the  assumed  increases  is  considered  low.  In\naddition, the Government will allow DOP to receive additional revenues from wheeling power to\nIndia.\n\n106. As a major portion of the Project\u2019s investment is in foreign currency, it is sensitive to the\nngultrum  devaluation.  Drastic  devaluation  of  the  local  currency  is  unlikely  to  happen  as  the\nngultrum is tied to the Indian rupee. This issue will be addressed as part of the ongoing dialogue\non tariff structure and the scheduled private sector participation TA.\n\n2. \n\nInstitutional and Project Risks\n\nThe Government is required to provide financing for 20 percent of the project cost from\n107.\nits budget. The risk of shortfall in this is low considering the current prudent Government policy\nfor the budget. In addition, the power sector is a revenue-earning sector for the Government and\nthe  Project  is  provided  priority  because  of  its  socioeconomic  impact.  The  risk  of  institutional\ncapability not being adequate to construct and operate the Project is minimal because of DOP\u2019s\nconsiderable experience with similar projects and the track record of the ongoing project funded\nby  the  Bank.  Through  the  ongoing  project,  DOP\u2019s  technical  and  institutional  capability  as  the\nproject executing agency was substantially strengthened.\n\n108.\nTechnical,  environmental,  and  social  risks  are  minimal.  Implementation  risks  do  exist\ndue  to  the  geographic  difficulties.  However,  through  the  ongoing  rural  electrification  project,\nDOP has enough managerial capability to execute the proposed Project as DOP has acquired\nsufficient  logistic  capability  to  cover  all  districts  of  Bhutan.  In  addition,  advance  procurement\naction will provide DOP with the benefit of continuity. There will be a foreign exchange risk for\nDOP  after  the  planned  corporatization.  Therefore,  higher  debt  service  requirements  and  tariff\nadjustment to foreign currency fluctuation are covenanted.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n109.\nassurances, which has been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\na. \n\nCorporatization of DOP\nThe  new  legislation  for  the  power  sector  will  change  DOP  into  a  commercial\ncorporation  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  two  Bank  TAs,  Policy  and\nLegal Framework for Power Sector Development and Corporatization of DOP in\nconsultation with the Bank, and will be ratified by the end of FY2002.\n\n\f28\n\nb. \n\nAdministrative\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  and  DOP  will  provide  sufficient  human  resources  to\nundertake the corporatization of DOP in consultation with the Bank.\n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that DOP will have the number of personnel\nto  operate  and  maintain  the  corporatized  DOP  efficiently  and  effectively\nbased on the findings of the Corporatization TA.\n\nc. \n\nTariff Adjustment\n(i) \n\nThe  Government,  on  1  January  2000,  will  increase  the  urban  and\nindustrial  domestic  tariffs  to  Nu0.70  per  kWh  and  on  or  prior  to\n1 July 2001 will further  increase  the urban and  industrial domestic  tariffs\nto Nu0.80 per kWh.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the tariff study of the Bank TA\n(TA  BHU  2400),  the  Government  will  implement  a  two-part  tariff  for  the\ntransmission level and primary distribution level voltage consumers, and a\nthree-block tariff for the secondary voltage consumers by end of FY2001.\n\nfor \n\nthrough \n\nFollowing the corporatization of DOP, the Government will permit DOP to\nshare  export  earnings  from  the  sale  of  electricity  to  India  by  levying  a\nthe  DOP\u2019s\ntransmitting  bulk  power \nwheeling  charge \ntransmission  system.  The  wheeling  charge  with  revenue  from  domestic\ntariffs  will  together  be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  the  newly  corporatized\nDOP maintains the covenanted financial ratios starting from FY2005. The\nwheeling charge and the rate of increase of domestic tariffs to enable the\ncorporatized  DOP  to  meet  the  agreed  financial  ratios  will  be  accurately\ndetermined  through  the  two  Bank  TAs,  Policy  and  Legal  Framework  for\nPower Sector  Development  and  Corporatization  of  DOP,  in  consultation\nwith  the  Bank.  Should  the  findings  of  the  two  TAs  require  further\nadjustment  of  the  tariff  and  wheeling  charge,  the  Government/DOP  will\nimplement them.\n\nthe  new \n\nlegislation  of \n\nThrough \ntransparent\nadministrative  tariff  adjustment  scheme  will  be  implemented,  such  as  a\ntariff  adjustment  to  foreign  currency  fluctuation  and  domestic  inflation\nprior to the corporatization of DOP.\n\nthe  power  sector,  a \n\nUpon the corporatization of DOP, the  Government  will  provide  adequate\nasset, equity, and liability structures with a maximum debt-equity ratio of\n60:40,  and  other  financial  arrangements  to  maintain  financial  viability  of\nthe corporatized DOP.\n\nStarting from FY2005, the corporatized DOP will maintain a rate of return\nof at least 6 percent of the net revalued fixed assets, debt service ratio of\nat least 1.5, and self-financing ratio of at least 20 percent.\n\nSeparate accounts will be maintained for the Project by DOP. Within the\nnine  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  DOP  will  submit  to  the\nBank  detailed  annual project  accounts  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable\nto the Bank.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nd. \n\nFinancial\n(i) \n\n\f29\n\n(v) \n\nThe  corporatized  DOP  will  submit  to  the  Bank  its  financial  statements,\nconsisting  of  an  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  a  statement  on\nsources and application of funds, audited by an auditor acceptable to the\nBank within nine months of the close of each financial year.\n\ne.\n\nProject Implementation\n(i) \n\nDOP, and after the corporatization of DOP, the corporatized DOP will be\nthe  Executing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible \nimplementing,\nmonitoring, and coordinating all project activities.\n\nfor \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe Government and DOP will make adequate budgetary allocations for\nthe  Project  for  each  related  fiscal  year  to  ensure  timely  and  effective\nproject implementation.\n\nDOP will maintain a project implementation unit in its O&M wing to ensure\ntimely  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  to  liaise  with  the  Bank  and\nconsultants during implementation of the Project. The unit will be headed\nby a senior engineer or its equivalent, be staffed with adequate technical\nand  administrative  personnel,  and  be  provided  with  adequate  support\nfacilities.\n\nThe Government and DOP will take all necessary actions to ensure  that\nall lands, rights-of-way, and other rights in land or privileges required for\nthe  Project  are  made  available  on  a  timely  basis.  The  Government  will\noffer  adequate  cash  compensation  or  suitable  alternative  land  sites  to\nlandowners affected by the land acquisition.\n\nDOP  will  monitor  project  implementation  with  benchmark  information  to\nbe  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank.  During  the  implementation  period,  DOP\nwill  furnish  the  Bank  with  a  quarterly  report  including  a  description  of\nphysical progress, problems and difficulties encountered, and summary of\na  financial  accounts  for  the  project,  which  will  consist  of  project\nexpenditures during the period, year  to  date,  and  total to date.  DOP  will\nsubmit a Project completion report to the Bank within three months after\ncompletion of the Project.\n\nf. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n(i) \n\nDOP will ensure that all environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and\nstandards  are  complied  with  during \nthe  project  construction  and\noperational stages. DOP will ensure that  adverse  environmental  impacts\nrelated  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  are  minimized\nthrough  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  program  and\nmitigation measures as specified in the initial environmental examination\nprepared for the Project, and as agreed with the Bank.\n\n(ii) \n\nDOP will perform the social and environmental monitoring activities.  The\nresult  of  the  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  will  be  reported  to  the\nBank  through  the  quarterly  reports  on  Project  implementation  and  an\nevaluation report after project completion.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  funds  in  a  timely  manner  for\nimplementation of such mitigation measures as necessary.\n\n\f30\n\n(iv) \n\nDuring the implementation phase, DOP will make the service connections\nto the poor households a  priority.  The poor  households  will  be  identified\nby  DOP  during  implementation,  through  consultations  with  community\nrepresentatives, village leaders, and district administrations.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectivity\n\n110.\n\nThe Government has agreed to undertake the following actions prior to loan effectivity.\n\nCreate a group in MTI that will act as a steering committee for the TA, Corporatization of\nDOP. The group will comprise at least four dedicated officers, one project manager, one\nfinancial specialist, one administrative officer, and one engineer at the initial stage.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n111.\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the\nBank  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  7,206,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the\nSustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of\n8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially\nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n21 October 1999\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\fNumber\n\nTitles\n\nPage\n\nCited On\n(page, para)\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nProject Framework\n\nPower Supply and Energy Balances of Division of Power\n\nExisting Power System in Bhutan\n\nExternal Assistance to the Power Sector from 1993 Onward\n\nUpdated Action Plan for Tariff Adjustment and Corporatization\nof Division of Power\n\nSummary of Human Resource Development Program of\nDivision of Power\n\nDetailed Project Description\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nTentative Contract Packages\n\nTerms of Reference for Consulting Services for Project\nImplementation\n\nOrganizational Chart of Division of Power\n\nNotes and Assumptions for the Financial Projections\n\nSummary Initial Environment Examination\n\nSummary Social Impact Analysis\n\nTechnical Assistance for Corporatization of Division of Power\n\nEconomic Analysis of the Project\n\n32\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n52\n\n60\n\n68\n\n71\n\n1,4\n\n5,18\n\n6,22\n\n7,29\n\n8,36\n\n9,39\n\n15,61\n\n15,64\n\n16,69\n\n17,70\n\n17,71\n\n18,75\n\n19,78\n\n20,81\n\n22,87\n\n23,89\n\n24,94\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nProject Target\n(Verifiable Indicator)\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanism\n\nMajor Assumptions/Risks\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\na.

The  components  have  the  following  physical\nfeatures:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ncivil works and installation of 182 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of single circuit and\n65 cct-km of spur 33 kilovolt (kV) overhead lines;\n\ncivil works and installation of 33 kV pole-mounted load break switches and auto-\nreclosers;\n\ninstallation of 30 cct-km of single circuit and 113 cct-km of spur 11 kV overhead\nlines plus replacement of 24 km of existing 11 kV conductors;\n\n(iv) \n\ninstallation of 11 kV load break switches and auto-reclosers;\n\n(v) \n\ninstallation  of  6,103  kVA  of  33  kV  and  3,823  kVA  of  11  kV  pole-mounted\ndistribution transformers; and\n\n(vi) \n\ninstallation of 354 km of low voltage (LV) bundled conductor.\n\nDistricts to be electrified in the western  Bhutan  are  Chhukha,  Dagana,  Paro,  Punakha,\n2.\nSamste,  Thimphu,  and  Wangdue.  The  substations  at  Lobesa  (for  Punakha  and  Wangdue\ndistricts),  Olathang  (for  Paro  district),  Jemina,  Dechhencholing,  and  Olakha  (for  Thimphu\ndistrict),  and  Gedu  (for  Chhukha district)  will feed  the project  areas  through  33  kV  and  11  kV\ndistribution  network  extensions.  All  these  substations  receive  power  through  the  Chhukha\ngrid system. For  Dagana district, as the  only available power  source  is  Dara  Chhu  mini  hydro\n(2 x 100, 200 kW), the electrification plans under the Project for this area are constrained by its\navailability.  When  Basochhu  hydro  project  is  commissioned,  66  kV  line  extensions  to  these\nareas  are  planned  subject  to  available  funds,  and  further  electrification  in  this  district  will  be\nundertaken in future.\n\n3.\nDistricts  to  be  electrified  in  central  Bhutan  include  Bumthang,  Sarpang,  and  Trongsa.\nMini/Micro  hydro  stations,  Chhume  (for  Bhumtang),  and  Tangsibji  (for  Trongsa)  are  available\npower sources for the Project. Network expansion for these areas has also been  restricted by\nthese  power  sources.  Transmission  network  expansion  plans  for  Tsirang  from  Basochhu  grid\nextension and for Zhemgang through Kurichhu are under consideration by the Division of Power\n(DOP). Gelephu substation is planned as the main power source for Sarpang district.\n\n4.\nDistricts  to  be  electrified  in  the  eastern  Bhutan  are  Lhuentse,  Mongar,  Pemagatshel,\nTrashigang, and Yangtse. The available power sources under the Project for the eastern region\nare  mainly  mini  hydro  plants  (i.e.  Khaling  mini  hydro  plant  for  Pemagatshel,  Khalanzi  for\nMongar,  Gangzur  for  Lhuentse  and  Ranjung,  and  Chenari  for  Trashigang  and  Yangtse).\nKurichhu  hydropower  plant  will  result  in  future  grid  expansion  in  these  districts  for  further\nexpansion.\n\n\fAppendix 7, page 2\n\nPart B. \n\nRural Electrification by Solar Panels\n\n5.\nThese  systems  intend  to  electrify  schools,  hospitals,  monasteries,  and  community\nactivities. Each unit comprises two solar panels (55 W peak), 12 V battery of 125 ampere-hours\n(AH)  capacity,  charge  controller,  and  four  11  W  lights.  Local  community  centers  in  Lhuentse\ndistrict  (Dungkhar),  Dagana  district  (Dujjaygaon),  and  Tsirang  district  have  been  identified  as\nthe candidate sites. The total number of consumers using solar panels will be 28.\n\nPart C. \n\nSmall-Scale Pilot SCADA System\n\n6.\nThis  component  is  a  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  within\nThimphu  City  as  the  pilot  system.  The  system  includes  monitoring  Thimphu  hydro  station,  a\ndiesel station, and Dechhencholing, Motithang, and Olakha substations in Thimphu using power\nline carrier. While the system will be initially for data acquisition, Dechhencholing is designed for\nremote control.\n\n\fAppendix 8\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n\nForeign\n\nUnit\n\nQuantity Exchange\n\nLocal Currency\n\n($\u2019000)\n\n(Nu\u2019000)\n\n($\u2019000)\n\nTotal\n($\u2019000)\n\n1.  33 kV Overhead Lines\n\ncct-km\n\n247\n\n2,224\n\n20,612\n\n485\n\n2,709\n\n2.  11 kV Overhead Lines\n\ncct-km\n\n167\n\n998\n\n10,540\n\n248\n\n1,246\n\nItem\n\nA.

As  an  independent  entity,  DOP  will  have  its  own  assets  and  be  responsible  for  its\nassociated liabilities. The Bank consultant under TA 2400-BHU1 estimated the value of assets,\nthat  are  under  the  responsibility  of  DOP.  The  value  of  these  assets  (mainly  transmission  and\ndistribution assets) as of FY1996 is used as the basis for DOP\u2019s financial projections. Additional\nassets during the period under review are based on DOP\u2019s firm investments during the Eighth\nFive-Year Plan (1998-2002) and planned investments up to FY2010. Included in the investment\nplans for the Eighth Plan are the Bank-financed first Rural Electrification Project (RE1) and the\nproposed Project. DOP is assumed to continue to purchase power from Chhukha Hydropower\nCorporation (CHPC) for the domestic market.\n\nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions\n\n2.\n\nMajor assumptions for DOP\u2019s financial projections include the following.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe pro forma projected financial statements of DOP were prepared for the fiscal\nperiod 1999 to 2010 and are in current terms. DOP's fiscal year ends on 30 June.\n\nThe domestic inflation rates are assumed at 7.8 percent in FY1999, 7.6 percent\nin FY2000, 7.4 percent in FY2001, and 7.2 percent from FY2002 onward, in line\nwith  the  Bank\u2019s  Project  Administration  Instructions  (PAI).  The  international\ninflation rate is assumed at 2.4 percent per annum during the period of analysis.\n\nThe exchange rate used is Nu42.5 to $1.00 for 1999 adjusted during the forecast\nperiod based on the differential between the assumed domestic and international\ninflation rates.\n\nOperating revenues will be derived mainly from sales of domestic electricity and\nwheeling  charges  from  transmitting  the  bulk  power  to  the  Indian  grid,  and  are\nprojected  based  on  load  forecasts  and  the  assumed  tariff  rates  and  wheeling\ncharges  per  kWh.  The  domestic  load  forecast  in  FY1999/2000  is  estimated  at\n400 GWh, and for the subsequent years, the overall load forecast is assumed to\ngrow  conservatively  by  5 percent  per  annum  as  no  major  investments  are\nexpected  to  take  place  during  the  period  under  review.2  The  three  generation\nplants,  Basochhu,  Kurichhu,  and  Tala  will  come  into  production  starting  from\nFY2002  for  Basochhu  and  Kurichhu,  and  from  FY2005  for  Tala.  With  these\nplants,  the  total  generation  capacity  of  Bhutan  will  be  about  1,500  megawatt\n(MW).  Excess  supply  will  be  exported  to  India.  In  line  with  this,  the  wheeling\ncharges will be realized only after DOP is corporatized in FY2002, and when all\nthe transmission assets of CHPC are transferred to DOP.\n\n                                                       \n1 TA 2400-BHU:  Institutional and Financial Development of DOP, for $400,000, approved on 30 September 1995.\n2  The average annual growth during FY1992 to FY1997 was about 17 percent , however, this was mainly due to the\n\ncommissioning of Bhutan Ferro Alloys Limited (a ferro silicon manufacturer).\n\n\fAppendix 13, page 2\n\n(v) \n\nThe  domestic  tariff  assumes  the  new  rate  proposed  at  Nu0.7  per  kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) for urban/industrial consumers; it will be effective starting from 1  January\n2000.  As  agreed  by  the  Government,  this  rate  will  increase  to  Nu0.8  per  kWh\nstarting from 1 July 2001. The tariff for rural consumers will remain at the current\nlevel  of  Nu0.5  per  kWh  up  to  the  end  of  FY2000  and  rise  slowly  at  half  of  the\ndomestic  inflation  rate.  To  achieve  the  financial  targets  by  FY2005,  the  overall\naverage  domestic  tariff  during  this  period  will  have  to  be  increased  to  about\nNu1.0 per kWh. The nominal wheeling charge is assumed at Nu0.10 per kWh for\nFY2002,  this  takes  into  consideration  the  current  wheeling  charges  paid  by  the\nGovernment  of  Bhutan  in  using  the  Indian  grid,  i.e.,  ranging  from  Nu0.05  to\nNu0.20 per kWh depending on the voltage level. Based on current assumptions,\nthe wheeling charge will also need to reach at least Nu0.12/kWh to achieve the\nfinancial  targets  by  FY2005.  Beyond  this  time,  the  annual  average  tariff  and\nwheeling charge were determined at a level sufficient to fulfill the Bank\u2019s financial\ncovenants.\n\n(vi) \n\nOperating  expenses  consist  of  (i)  power  purchase,  which  comes  mainly  from\nCHPC,  (ii) operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  incurred  by  DOP,  and\n(iii) depreciation of existing and newly acquired assets.  Cost of power,  currently\nat Nu0.30 per kWh, will increase in line with domestic inflation. The current O&M\ncost  incurred  by  DOP  is  approximately  3  percent  of  its  total  historical  capital\ncosts.  Depreciation  of  fixed  assets  is  calculated  on  a  straight-line  basis  with\naverage life for transmission and distribution assets of about 25 years.\n\n(vii) \n\nIn accordance to the prevailing tax rate, DOP will pay income or corporate taxes\nof  30 percent  per  annum  on  the  net  operating  income  after  interest  payment.\nDOP will be allowed to carry its losses for future tax payments.\n\n(viii)  Overall  system  losses  for  domestic  consumption  are  assumed  at  9  percent\n\nbased on the average historical losses in the past 5 years.\n\n(ix) \n\nAs  of  FY1996,  the  total  gross  assets  under  DOP  were  estimated  at  Nu1,469\nmillion  with  some  adjustments  made  to  bring  them  to  their  current  value,  and\nbased  on  the  usage  life  of  these  assets,  the  accumulated  depreciation  was\nderived. During the fiscal period 1996 to 1999, additional capital expenditure was\nincurred  such  as  rehabilitation  of  the  mini  and  micro  hydels,  improvement  and\nupgradation of  rural  and  urban  transmission  and  distribution  systems,  including\nthe Bank\u2019s RE1 project. For the purpose of this projection, it is assumed that the\nGovernment  will  be  responsible for  the overall  budgetary allocation  on  the  RE1\nproject,  and  only  when  it  is  completed  and  commissioned  that  the  assets  and\ntheir associated liabilities are transferred to DOP. The cost of the RE1 project is\nabout $9.5 million. For the proposed Project, which will commence in 2000 at an\nestimated  cost  of  $12.5  million,  it  is  assumed  that  the  capital  expenditure  will\nalready be reflected on DOP's account.\n\n(x) \n\nThe  existing  assets  of  Nu1,469  million  are  assumed  to  have  a  40:60  debt  to\nequity  ratio  based  on  the  historical  pattern  of  capital  investment  made  in  the\npower sector  in  Bhutan.  The existing  loan  was assumed  to  carry a  soft term of\n10 percent annual interest rate and 15 year repayment period. This is in line with\n\n\f(xi) \n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nthe  current  financing  terms  in  the  power  sector  in  Bhutan3  although  regular\ncommercial loans are at about 16 percent per annum. For the two Bank projects,\nthe Government will onlend the loans it receives from the Bank, and the balance\nis treated as a grant from the Government to DOP. The Bank loans are $7.5 and\nthe\n$10  million  equivalent,  respectively.  The \nGovernment  to  DOP  on  these  foreign  loans  are  assumed  at  their  actual  rates,\nand all will have a repayment period of 15 years.4 Interest and principal payments\nof these loans will start at the commissioning of these projects. DOP will bear the\nforeign exchange risks associated with these foreign currency loans.5\n\ninterest  rates  charged  by \n\nConstruction-in-progress  during  FY2000-FY2010  reflect  the  investment  plans  of\nDOP. The estimate given by DOP on its investments in the next 10 years amount\nto  about  Nu10.0  billion,  this  excludes  the  two  Bank  projects.  These  substantial\ninvestments  include  all  the  bulk  and  nonbulk  transmission  and  distribution\nprojects and several mini and micro-hydels. It is understood that the Government\nof  Bhutan  has  received  commitment,  mainly  from  the  Government  of  India  to\nfinance 65.1 percent of these investments on a grant basis. About 4.4 percent of\ntotal  investments  will  be  financed  by  loans  (for  the  Kurichhu  and  Tala\ntransmission projects), and the balance, about 30.5 percent will  be funded by a\ncombination  of  additional  grants  and  own  financing.  For  the  purpose  of  this\nprojection, for those investments to be implemented during the Eighth and Ninth\nfive-year plans, it was assumed that 60 percent would be financed by grants and\n40 percent by loans. At the end of these periods, DOP should be able to stand on\nits own to finance its future  investments  without  getting further grants.  DOP  will\npay about a 12 to 14 percent interest rate on the loans, which is higher than the\nloan, charged by the Government of India of about 9 to 10.75 percent per annum.\nAll of these  loans are assumed to have a  repayment  period of 10 years with a\n5-year grace period.\n\n(xii)  Gross  fixed  assets  are  revalued  annually  according  to  the  domestic  inflation\nrates.  The  calculation  for  the  financial  covenant,  rate  of  return  on  revalued  net\nfixed assets, is based on a three-year rolling average.\n\n(xiii)  Accounts  receivable  were  assumed  at  45  days  of  total  revenues,  inventory  at\n30 days of  O&M  costs, and  accounts  payable at 30 days of total  cost of power\nincluding O&M costs. DOP's accounts receivable are relatively low as more than\n80  percent  of  its  sales  are  to  industrial  and  bulk  consumers  that  usually  pay\nwithin the 30-day billing period.\n\n                                                       \n3  For  CHPC,  40  percent  of  the  investment  was  financed  by  a  15-year  loan  at  5  percent  interest  rate.  For  Kurichhu,\n40 percent of the capital cost is financed at an annual interest rate of 10.75 percent per annum payable in 15 years.\n40 percent of Tala Hydropower Project was financed by a loan with a 9 percent interest rate payable in 12 years.\n\n4  The loans from the Bank to the Government are on Asian Development Fund terms. For RE1, it was 1 percent service\ncharge with 40 years repayment period including 10 years grace period.

EXAMINATION\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  for  the  Sustainable  Rural\n1.\nElectrification  Project  is  based  on  the  investigations  and  findings  of  the  consultants  in\nassociation  with  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Division  of  Power  (DOP),  under  technical\nassistance (TA) 2912 BHU.1 The intensive data gathering and field survey including distribution\nline routing were undertaken  by  the  domestic  consultant  in  cooperation  with  local  community\nmembers  of  districts  and  villages.  The  SIEE  follows  the  Bank\u2019s  standard  format  for  such\nreports  and  addresses  potential  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  the  location,  design,\nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of the Project.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n1.\n\nType of Project\n\n2.\nThe  proposed  Sustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project  prepared  by  DOP  under  the\nEighth Five-Year Plan (FY1998-FY2002), as an integral part of the rural electrification program,\nwas  originally  created  during  the  Sixth  Plan  (FY1987-FY1991)  to  electrify  most  villages  in\nBhutan  using  hydropower.  Based  on  the  subsequent  feasibility  studies  and  field  experience,\nrural  electrification  is  being  upgraded  and  to  become  more  comprehensive  using  distribution\nnetworks as well as renewable power sources such as solar panels and mini/micro hydropower\ngeneration.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  policies  and  the\nBank's focus on Bhutan's infrastructure development.\n\n3.\n\nThe Project is classified under the Bank\u2019s Guidelines as Category B.\n\n2.\n\nCategory of Project\n\n3.\n\nNeed for the Project\n\n4.\nIt is estimated that over 87 percent of the Bhutanese population lives in rural areas and\nmore than 80 percent of the population leads an agrarian lifestyle. Most of the farmers do not\nhave access to electricity. Over 95 percent of  the  energy  consumed  in  the  rural  area  is  from\nfuelwood. This makes Bhutan's per capita consumption of fuelwood (2.4 cubic meters) one of\nthe  highest  in  the  world  and  puts  tremendous  pressure  on  forest  resources.  Several\nGovernment-initiated  projects  aimed  at  reducing  the  dependency  on  fuelwood  have  not  met\nwith very much success. Kerosene cookers,  smokeless  stoves,  solar  panels,  and  nontaxable\nfuel-efficient  electrical  appliances  are  a  few  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Government  to\ndecrease the consumption of fuelwood.\n\nIn  rural  areas,  where  electricity  is  not  available,  fuelwood  is  used  for  cooking  and\n5.\nheating. Apart from the depletion of forest resources due to the excessive use of fuelwood, a\nlarge  section  of  the  rural  population  that  does  not  have  access  to  electricity  suffers  from\nrespiratory problems. This can be attributed to the smoke emitted from use of kerosene lamps\n(wick type) for lighting and inefficient use of fuelwood for cooking and heating. Most of the rural\n\n                                                  \n1 TA 2912-BHU:  Second Rural Electrification Project, for $500,000, approved on 19 November 1997.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 2\n\nareas are over 2000 meters above sea level, making the cold season extremely harsh, which\nleads  to  increased  fuelwood  consumption  just  for  heating  purposes.  In  general,  however,\nfuelwood is mostly used for cooking purposes, except for a few wealthy citizens living in district\nheadquarters  who  use  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Most  Government  staff  use  LPG  or\nkerosene stoves for cooking purposes.  Kerosene lamps are used for lighting in almost all the\nrural  areas  where  electricity  is  not  available.  Some  farmers  who  cannot  afford  or  have  no\naccess to kerosene, use resin and coniferous wood sticks for lighting.\n\nTo improve the standard of living, promote economic development, and improve health\n6.\nand sanitation standards, the Eighth Plan provides for the expansion of the rural electrification\nprogram.  The  existing  electricity  networks  are  proposed  to  be  extended  into  rural  areas\nwherever  there  is  excess  power  available.  The  Project  proposes  extension  of  high  voltage\ndistribution systems from the nearest power sources to distribution transformers in designated\nvillages,  together  with  the  associated  low  voltage  networks  and  consumer  connections.  In\naddition, solar panels will be installed at local community centers that are far from a distribution\nnetwork.\n\nThe  proposed  Project  covers  the  following  districts  in  Bhutan:    Bumthang,  Chhukha,\n7.\nDagana,  Lhuentse,  Mongar,  Paro,  Pema  Gatshel,  Punakha,  Samtse,  Sarpang,  Thimphu,\nTrashigang, Trashi Yangtse, Trongsa, Tsirang, Wangdue Phodrang.\n\n4.\n\nLocation\n\n5.\n\nSize of Operation\n\n8.\nThe  proposed  Project  intends  to  provide  infrastructure  for  the  supply  of  electricity  to\n6,038 new customers in 16 districts. In addition to distribution network expansion, solar panels\nwill be provided to three local community centers located far from power sources. Apart  from\nthe  construction  of  electrification  network,  some  provisions  will  also  be  made  for  tools  and\nvehicles.\n\n6.\n\nProposed Schedule for Implementation\n\nThe  physical  implementation  of  the  Project  will  commence  in  March  2001  and  be\n\n9.\ncompleted in September 2003.\n\n7.\n\nDescription of Project\n\nThe  major  part  of  the  Project  will  involve  construction  of  overhead  electric  lines  at\n10.\nvoltages of 33 kV, 11 kV, and 0.4 kV. The lines will be of pole-type  construction.  Distribution\ntransformers and associated equipment will be mounted on the poles for supply of power into\nthe low voltage lines, connecting from there to consumers' houses and premises. Solar panels\nand supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system will  be  installed  in  premises  of\npublic facilities and substations respectively.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 3\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\na.\n\nTopography\n\n11.\nBhutan  is  wedged  between  India  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  along  the\nHimalayan Mountains, and covers an area of approximately 46,000 square kilometers with an\necosystem  ranging  from  subtropical  to  alpine.  The  altitude  in  Bhutan  ranges  from  about  200\nmeters (m) in the south to over 7,000 m in the north. Most of the country is almost completely\nmountainous,  with  deeply  incised  river  valleys.  Even  the  Sub-Himalayan  foothills,  which  is  a\nzone ranging from 500 to 3000 m is very rugged and drops sharply to the plains of India. The\nProject will span most of the country from east to west and will include a few southern districts\nas well. Therefore, all topographical features such as plains, valleys, and mountain ridges will\nbe encountered.\n\nb.\n\nClimate\n\n12.\nThe huge extremes in elevation and topography of the country result in great diversity\nin  climatic  types,  characterized  by  a  wide  range  of  temperatures  and  precipitation.  With\nincreasing elevation, the climate changes from subtropical humid and subhumid, to temperate\nmonsoon humid and subhumid, to temperate alpine continental. Maximum temperatures reach\napproximately  40  degree  Celsius  (  C  )  during  summer  in  the  plains,  but  in  the  mountainous\nregions, the temperature can fall to 20 degree C below zero during winter months.\n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\nOver 72 percent  of  Bhutan's  total  land  area  is  under  forest  cover.  Bhutan  has  one  of\n13.\nthe  richest  floras  in  the  world  for  a  country  of  its  size,  due  to  a  combination  of  climatic  and\ntopographic diversity, and its position on the interface between the Indo-Malesian and Paleartic\nbiogeophysical  regions.  Natural  areas  not  covered  in  forest  are  commonly  covered  by\ntemperate  grasslands.  Over  26  percent  of  the  country  is  under  protected  area,  wildlife\nsanctuaries, national parks, and reserves. These were created to protect wildlife resources and\nendangered  species.  None  of  the  areas  to  be  electrified  encroaches  upon  these  protected\nareas and reserves.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\na.\n\nPopulation and Communities\n\n14.\nThe  population  of  Bhutan  was  estimated  at  around  0.6  million  in  1996,  while  its  land\narea is around 46,000 square kilometers. The population growth rate is 3.1 percent per year.\nAbout 90 percent of the population lives in small villages scattered along the mountain slopes\nand valleys. The areas to be electrified under the Project are  some  of  the  most  populated  in\nthe country. The areas are characterized by houses that are widely scattered with a few shops,\nand some of the areas have small-scale industries. Some of the towns in the project area fall\nunder  administrative  centers  and  have  basic  health  units  (BHUs),  hotels,  primary  schools,\nguest  houses,  Royal  Bhutan  Police  centers  and  small  local  government  offices.  Most  of  the\nproject areas is linked by roads for vehicles.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 4\n\nOver  80  percent  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  are  farmers  by  profession  and\n15.\nwork on their own land. The remaining 20 percent are either employed by the Government as\nfield  extension  workers  from  various  Government  departments,  or  have  small  businesses  of\ntheir  own,  or  are  employed  by  a  few  small-scale  cottage  industries.  Many  of  the  villages\ncovered in the Project have access to BHUs, primary community schools, safe drinking water\n(through the Government rural water supply schemes), and vehicle roads or mule tracks.\n\nb.\n\nIndustries/Infrastructure\n\n16.\nChhukha  and  Samtse  are  the  only  districts  in  the  project  areas  that  have  major\nindustrial activity. Chhukha has three major industries that are the largest customers of DOP,\nnamely, Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd., Bhutan Chemical, Calcium Carbide Ltd., and Bhutan Board\nParticle Ltd.  Samtse has two major industries that also contribute to DOP\u2019s income, namely,\nPenden Cement Authority Ltd. and Bhutan Food Product Ltd.\n\nIn the project area,  there  are  also  a  few  small  timber  sawmills,  flour/husk  mills,  hand-\n17.\nmade  paper  units,  small-scale  weaving  industries,  handicrafts,  small  shops,  and  restaurants.\nA few places have general shops. The Government has initiated small industrial development\nand  provides  training  in  business  management.  Banking  institutions,  such  as  the  Bhutan\nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC), have spearheaded rural economic development by\nproviding easily available small loans to the farmers. Housing and truck loans have also been\nprovided  by  the  institution.  BDFC  has  a  branch  office  in  all  the  districts  covered  under  this\nProject. The Bank of Bhutan has also granted loans to small-scale businesses.\n\nc.\n\nLand Use Planning\n\nthe \n\nUnder \n\nforestry  sector,  development  programs \n\n18.\ntheir\nreinforcement, development of community and protected forestry, development and protection\nof  critical  watersheds  and  forest  roads,  and  building  of  ranger  offices  have  been  initiated\nduring the Seventh Plan period. Some areas within the Project have been irrigated.\n\nfor  plantations  and \n\nd.\n\nAgricultural and Mineral Development\n\n19.\nAgricultural  extension  centers  have  been  established  in  several  villages  within  the\nproject area during the Seventh Plan period, which includes soil conservation, plant protection,\nseeds  and  seedling  supply,  farm  mechanization,  soil  fertility  development,  cash  crop\ndevelopment,  and  livestock  and  animal  health  improvement.  Potential  mineral  resources  and\nproposals for their development are as yet unknown.\n\n4.\n\nQuality of Life Values\n\na.\n\nSocioeconomic Values\n\nMost of the people make their living by subsistence farming. Many of the farmers in the\n20.\nproject area grow rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, vegetables, chilli, and mustard.\nPotato, apple, orange, beetle nut, cardamom, chilli, and soybean appear to be the main cash\ncrops.  Some  farmers  in  the  project  area  combine  crop  production  with  small  livestock\nhusbandry. The main domestic animals are cattle, mules, horses, pigs, yak, sheep, donkeys,\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 5\n\nand  poultry.  Cattle  are  kept  for  dairy  products  and  to  provide  field  manure.  Horses  are  used\nprimarily to transport agricultural produce from remote villages, pigs are kept  for  meat  and  to\nproduce a cash income, and poultry are kept primarily for eggs.\n\nAbout 93 percent of the farmers in the project area use the produce of the land for their\n21.\nown  subsistence.  Food  products  such  as  rice,  wheat/barley  flours,  sugar,  salt,  spices,  edible\noils, milk products, and dry fish are imported through the Food Corporation of Bhutan and sold\nat the shops. Exports from the project area mainly consist of cash crops, if there is a surplus,\nhandicrafts, woven garments, and a few dairy product such as cheese and butter.\n\n22.\nSeveral  people  in  each  village  have  joined  the  local  monk  body  or  nunneries,  as\nBhutanese predominately follow Buddhism, and religion plays an important role in the lives of\nevery family. These people are fed and clothed by the Government, and they are paid a small\nsalary  as  well.  Furthermore,  monks  are  held  in  great  respect  and  play  an  active  part  in\ncommunity life.\n\nb.\n\nPublic Health\n\n23.\nMany  of  the  villages  surveyed  had  a  BHU  or  were  close  to  having  one.  The\nestablishment of BHUs in rural villages have made a positive impact, as the villagers no longer\nhave  to  travel  great  distances  to  receive  basic  medical  treatment.  However,  the  efficiency  of\nthe  BHUs  is  restricted  due  to  lack  of  electricity.  Photo-voltaic  electricity,  where  available,\nprovides only limited energy for lighting and equipment.\n\nc.\n\nCultural and Religious Values\n\n24.\nIt  was  found  during  the  surveys  that  a  lot  of  the  family  expenditure  goes  to  perform\nreligious ceremonies. In fact, every family performs a minimum of two religious ceremonies a\nyear.  Furthermore,  a  lot  of  the  hard-earned  money  of  the  villagers  is  spent  on  undertaking\nreligious  pilgrimages.  The  seriousness  with  which  the  people  take  their  religion  can  be  seen\nfrom  the  presence  of  many  religious  monuments,  symbols,  and  temples.  Almost  all  villages\nhave  their  own  temple.  Practically  every  house  in  the  surveyed  villages  has  an  altar  where\ndaily religious observance is carried out by the family.\n\nd. \n\nAesthetic Values\n\n25.\nAs  the  low  and  high  voltage  lines  will  follow  main  roads  and  their  supports  will  be  of\npole type, the reduction of aesthetic values resulting from this Project will be minimal compared\nwith the largely unspoilt environment. Also most of the lines are in rural areas.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Location\n\na.\n\nResettlement Issues\n\nAs most of the  distribution  poles  will  run  along  road  sides,  the  Project  will  not  require\n26.\nmuch private land for erection of poles. The villagers in the project area are willing to allot the\nnecessary land required for the poles when it encroaches on their property. Small portions of\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 6\n\nland may be required for transformers. Some of the land needed for this purpose is presently\nprivately owned and will need to  be  acquired  from  its  owners.  Some  of  the  land  is  cultivated\nand  the  Government  will  pay  some  compensation  for  this  land.  However,  the  presently\ncultivated  land  required  for  such  permanent  facilities  will  be  minimal.  No  land  value  changes\nwill occur from the location of the Project, and therefore social inequities will be minimal. There\nwill be no resettlement of population due to the Project.\n\nb.\n\nEcological Impacts\n\n27.\nThe  Project  will  have  no  impact  on  any  rare  or  endangered  flora  or  fauna  species  or\ntheir  habitat.  This  is  because  (i)  the  Project  does  not  comprise  a  mass  concentration  of\nconstruction,  (ii)  the  Project  is  not  concentrated  in  a  particular  area  but  is  spread  over  16\ndistricts, (iii) the Project does not encroach upon any precious ecological area or other valuable\nlands, and (iv) the project area has already been greatly modified by human activity. Site visits\nhave  indicated  that  construction  activities  in  these  areas  will  in  no  way  have  any  negative\nimpact  on  the  ecology.  Apart  from  minor  brush  clearing  along  the  roadside,  no  deforestation\nwill be required. Moreover, the Project does not trespass on any water source areas.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design\n\n28.\nThe Project will  not  interfere  with  other  utilities,  traffic,  or  access  ways.  The  electricity\nwill  be  distributed  throughout  the  project  area  by  means  of  overhead  distribution  lines  and\ntransformers.  The  lines  will  generally  run  along  the  side  of  the  road  and  only  minor  bush\nclearing may be required for them. There will be no discharge of polluting materials, given the\nnature of the Project. There are very few cultural features that fall within the project area such\nas temples, monasteries, and the like. With proper planning of the route, none of the cultural\nfeatures will be disturbed.\n\n29.\nThe  impact  of  the  lines  and  transformers  will  not  have  any  impact  on  the  ecology  or\ncultural features, other than in terms of visual appearance and introduction of hazards arising\nfrom  the  presence  of  live  wires  and  apparatus.  There  will  be  no  blockages  of  wildlife\npassageways.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with the Construction Stage\n\nMost  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  may  occur  during  the  construction  stage.\n30.\nDue to the type of construction (mostly erection of poles and minor buildings) soil erosion and\nsilt  runoff  will  be  insignificant.  Other  major  nuisance  to  nearby  properties  such  as  noise  and\ndust will also be insignificant because of the nature of the work and low population density of\nrural areas. Minor social impacts will arise as a result of the presence of installation work force\nduring  erection  of  the  lines  and  connection  of  the  houses  to  the  network.  This  force  is\nexpected  to  number  between  40  to  80  throughout  the  project  area.  However,  this  number\ncould decrease if local people from the  beneficiary  villages  are  hired  for  manual  labour.  This\nwould  have  a  double  benefit,  firstly,  the  social  impacts  would  be  lower,  and  secondly  these\nvillagers would earn some cash income.\n\nPeople  from  the  villages  to  be  electrified  are  willing  to  do  the  basic  unskilled  manual\n31.\nlabor  required  for  the  Project  in  and  around  their  villages.  A  substantial  portion  of  the  labor\nforce  may  be  recruited  locally  for  unskilled  work.  A  few  foreign  nationals  may  be  required  to\nassist during the initial phase of project supervision for newly introduced equipment, materials,\nand tools.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 7\n\nThe construction phase of this Project will in no way hamper wildlife movement, nor will\n32.\nit have any effect on utilities, traffic, access ways, services, or land values. It is envisaged that\nthe  construction  stage  will  not  create  any  ecological  impacts.  Adequate  and  regular\nsurveillance  and  supervision  of  construction  activities  will  ensure  that  no  significant  damage\noccurs to ecology.\n\n4.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n\nSince the beneficiary villages have not had electricity before, it is possible that they will\n33.\nbe unaware of the dangers of electricity and the possibility of health hazards. Therefore, it  is\nrecommended  that  as  areas  get  connected  to  the  supply  network  DOP  should  continue  a\ncampaign to promote public awareness about public safety and proper use and management\nof  electrical  current  and  appliances,  in  order  to  prevent  electricity-related  accidents,  which\nusually follow the introduction of electricity to new consumers.\n\nThe permanent labor force required for the maintenance of the network and collection\n34.\nof  payments  will  be  existing  staff  of  DOP  for  such  purposes  in  the  given  districts.  The\noperational  phase  will,  in  fact,  generate  the  least  ecological  impacts  among  any  of  the  other\nphases. This phase will, instead, bring about benefits  to  the  environment  as  the  villagers  will\nbecome less dependent on forestry resources as electricity will substitute for the use of fossil\nfuels or fuelwood.\n\n5.\n\nPotential Environmental Enhancement Measures\n\n35.\nThe  main  potential  environmental  enhancement  measures  are  local  social  impacts,\nwhich  are  considered  to  be  significant  and  mostly  positive.  These  include  (i)  improved\nelectricity-dependent  infrastructure,  such  as  water  pumping,  telecommunications  etc.;  (ii)  an\nlighting,  better  educational\nimprovement \nopportunities,  and  social  services  for  positive  regional  development  arising  through  the\navailability of electricity; (iii) enhancement of income and creation of jobs in the medium term;\nand (iv) reduction of the dependency on fuelwood in the long term.\n\nthrough  pollution-free \n\nthe  quality  of \n\nlife \n\nin \n\n6.\n\nAdditional Considerations (Compensation)\n\n36.\nA  factor  that  needs  to  be  considered  is  that  during  the  construction  phase,  poles  will\nneed to be erected. Some of the land required for this purpose may be privately owned. The\nlandowners will need to be compensated. Where  private  property  is  required  for  this  Project,\nthe  owners  will  be  consulted  by  DOP  to  negotiate  right  of  access.  Consultation  and\ncompensation will need to be undertaken once the design of the Project has progressed to the\nnext stage. Compensation in cash will be provided by the Government to owners for crops and\ntrees  located  in  right-of-way  of  the  erected  poles.  The  cash  compensation  for  crops  will  be\nbased on productivity of the land in the past, while  for  trees  will  be  based  on  type,  age,  and\ndiameter of trees.\n\n\fAppendix 14, page 8\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n37.\nEnvironmental  monitoring  programs  associated  with  the  Project  will  be  conducted  as\npart  of  DOP's  regular  monitoring  programs.  Regular  inspection,  especially  during  the  rainy\nseason,  will  have  to  be  undertaken  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  site  stabilization  and\nrevegetation  measures,  if  any,  and  to  identify  problem  areas  for  immediate  treatment  and\nmaintenance operations. Particular emphasis will have to be given to erosion problems, if any,\nand timely remedial measures undertaken by minor civil work using cement and rocks as part\nof the monitoring program.\n\n38.\nMonitoring of forest resources and other ecological resources is the responsibility of the\nForestry  Service  Division  (FSD),  which  has  branch  offices  in  all  the  districts  covered  by  the\nProject. FSD will be notified and will be involved in the monitoring aspect. Nonetheless, DOP's\nmonitoring units will also note relevant adverse effects on ecological resources, if any, during\ntheir regular inspection field visits and notify the relevant authorities accordingly. The same will\nbe undertaken in the case of socioeconomic conditions, if required.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n39.\n\nThe main findings and recommendations include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThere will be significant socioeconomic and quality of life benefits for people in\nareas under the Project.\nThe impact on the environment will be minimal, as high and low voltage lines will\nmostly run along roads.\nThe project area does not encroach on any wildlife sanctuary, park, or reserve.\nNo  rare  or  endangered  species  or  their  natural  habitat  will  be  affected.  The\nProject does not trespass on any water source areas. Therefore, the ecological\ndamage arising from the Project will be minimal or nil.\nThe  local  residents  will  have  to  be  consulted  as  to  the  planning  of  the  works,\nand  compensation  should  be  paid  where  private  land  has  to  be  used  for  the\nProject.\nA  public  awareness/education  program  regarding  health  hazards  and  proper\nuse and management of electricity and its appliances should be continued upon\nelectrification of villages.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe  socioeconomic  evaluation  reveals  that  the  proposed  Project  will  definitely  have  a\n40.\npositive  impact  on  the  people  living  in  the  area  concerned.  The  Project  will  have  multiple\nbenefits such as increase in their income, improvement of their living standards and quality of\nlife,  increase  in  employment  opportunities,  improvement  of  health  standards,  longer  working\nhours, and access to social infrastructural development and educational opportunities.\n\n41.\nAlthough the Government does not require the preparation of an environmental impact\nassessment (EIA) for such projects, the screening process for the Project has been thorough.\nBased on the field investigation and the  previous  experience  with  projects  of  this  nature,  the\nenvironmental impact of the proposed Project  will be minimal and not affect any nationally or\ninternationally endangered wild life and flora. Therefore, a full EIA is not required.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 1\n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\nMore than 87 percent of Bhutanese people live in rural areas, most do not have access\n1.\nto electricity. Almost all the energy consumed in rural areas is from fuelwood. This puts pressure\non  forest  resources.  Fuelwood  is  mostly  used  for  cooking  purposes,  except  for  a  few  more\nwealthy  households  living  in  district  headquarters  which  use  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).\nKerosene is mostly used for lighting. Although forests occupy a dominant 72 percent of the total\nland  area,  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world,  the  supply  of  fuelwood  is  dwindling  rapidly.  The\nsolutions  to  the  emerging  energy  problems  in  rural  areas  of  Bhutan  through  conventional\nsupplies are difficult. Moreover conventional fuels also potentially cause serious environmental\nhazards  when  used  on  a  large  scale.  The  per  capita  consumption  of  fuelwood  in  Bhutan  is\nestimated to be 1.22 tons, which is one of the highest in the world.\n\n2.\nTo  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  rural  population,  promote  economic  growth,\nthe\nimported  fuels,  and  minimize \nreduce  overdependence  on \nGovernment\u2019s  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  provides  for  an  expansion  of  rural  electrification.  The\nGovernment  plans  to  carry  out  rural  electrification  by  either  grid  extension  or  isolated\ndevelopment  of  small  hydropower  plants  and  other  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  solar\npanels, as an alternative source of energy for lighting, cooking, and heating.\n\nfuelwood  consumption, \n\n3.\nStakeholder  participation  is a  key  to  the  success  of  rural  electrification. Without  strong\nand  sufficient  stakeholder  participation,  particularly  the  local  community,  the  utility  cannot\noperate  a  distribution  system on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  using  a\nparticipatory  approach  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).1  Through  this\napproach, \nincluding  communities,  nongovernment\norganization,  other  civil  society  organizations,  and  community-based  organizations  in  the\nproposed  project  area  were  obtained.  A  social  economic  survey,  consultations  as  well  as\ncommunity  participation,  were  conducted.  The  needs  for  rural \ninfrastructure  services,\nparticularly among the poor, as well as ways to improve the overall quality of life and prospects\nfor economic development in rural area were identified.\n\nthe  participation  of  all  stakeholders \n\nB.\n\nSocioeconomic Profiles\n\n4.\nThe present population is  estimated at 600,000. A  national  health  survey  conducted  in\n1994 indicates  that  infant  mortality  has fallen  since 1984, from 142 per 1,000  births  to 70 per\n1,000  births  in 1994. With  a  crude  birth  rate  estimated  at  39.9  per  1,000  population,  reduced\nmortality, and fertility remaining high at 5.6, the national population growth rate is estimated to\nhave increased to 3.1 percent from a previous estimate2 of 2.0 percent per annum.\n\n5.\nThe  literacy  rate  is  54  percent.  The  situation  has  improved  over  the  last  decades,\neducational infrastructure has expanded dramatically since the start of the first Five-Year Plan in\n1961.  In  1959,  there  were  only  11  primary  schools  in  the  entire  country,  and  a  student\npopulation  of  440.  There  are  now  over  100,000  students  in  322  schools  (primary,  junior,  and\nhigh schools) representing a gross enrollment of approximately 72 percent.\n\n                                                       \n1 TA 2912-BHU:  Second Rural Electrification Project, for $600,000, approved on 19 November 1997.\n2 Source:  1993 Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Planning.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 2\n\nWhile  a  systematic  expansion  of  basic  social  infrastructure  services  throughout  the\n6.\ncountry has achieved dramatic results over the past decades, approximately 80 percent of the\npopulation  has no access  to electricity.  Over  50  percent  of  the  population  now  has  access  to\npiped water and 80 percent to latrines.\n\n7.\nThe  majority  of  the  population  is  primarily  located  in  the  rural  areas  of  Bhutan,  and  is\ndependent  on  employment  in agricultural  activities  to  meet  basic  needs.  A  policy  of  balanced\nregional  development  to  direct  investment  into  less-developed  areas  of  the  country  forms\nanother important component in the structure of employment patterns. Of particular significance\nis the policy to locate power plants to promote industrial development in the interior part of the\ncountry. Another chance that has emerged in recent years was that villagers have been offered\na  chance  to  join  a  national  workforce  to  work  for  road  construction,  project,  and  construction\nsites.\n\n8.\nA  most  important  sector  of  the  economically  active  population  in  Bhutan  is  women.\nWomen already constitute 49.5 percent of the total population, and unlike many other countries,\nenjoy  equal  rights  in  law. Like  men  they  play  an  important  role  both  in  the  private  and  public\nsectors  and own  businesses.  Practices  related  to  inheritance  make no  differentiation  between\nsexes, although in some communities daughters may inherit all the family possessions.\n\nC.\n\nClientele Groups and Project Beneficiaries\n\n9.\nThe proposed Sustainable Rural Electrification Project will bring direct benefits to 5,437\nrural household consumers or approximately 43,500 people in the selected 16 of 20 districts of\nBhutan  together  with  associated  commercial,  social,  and  government  sector  consumers  (601)\nsuch  as  shops,  hotels,  schools,  basic  health  units,  monasteries,  etc.  The  Project\u2019s  benefits\ninclude (i) provide opportunity for income-generating activities, (ii) generate employment through\nexpansion of cottage and small industries to mitigate rural poverty, (iii) improve quality of rural\nlife and (iv) provide adequate education and health services to rural people, particularly the poor\nand vulnerable groups through electrification by indigenous generated hydropower from existing\npower stations and solar panels.\n\nD.\n\nPoverty\n\n10.\nBhutan\u2019s per capita gross national product  (GNP)  is  approximately  $485  (1996)  and  the\ncountry ranks 155th among 175 countries in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n1994 Human Development Index (HDI), published in 1997.3 Bhutan\u2019s HDI ranks lowest among the\neight  South  Asian  countries  and  is  lower  than  its  real  GDP  per  capita  rank  expressed  in\npurchasing power parity dollars. Reliable data on poverty are not available. Most of the population\ndepends on subsistence agriculture. On average, more than 60 percent of household expenditure\naccounts  for  food  and  beverages.  A  study  to  estimate  the  poverty  line  was  conducted  in  1998\nbased  on  the  Indian  yardstick  for  poverty.  The  expenditure  required  for  2,400  calories  of  daily\nintake in India was estimated at Nu2294 per capita per month at 1993-1994 prices. This figure was\nincreased  to  Nu322  to take  into account the harsher  climatic conditions  existing  in  Bhutan.  The\nincrease  pertained  to  clothing,  shelter,  transport,  and  fuel.  This  is  considered  appropriate  to\nestimate  the  expenditure  in  case  of  Bhutan,  as  nearly  70  percent  of  the  total  import  trade  and\n\n                                                       \n3 GNP per capita for Bhutan is calculated based on the official population estimate of 600,000 (1996), which is different\nfrom the latest United Nations estimate of 1.7 million (1994). HDI is based on the UN estimate. Efforts are being made\nby the aid community in consultation with the Bhutanese authorities to reconcile the population estimates.\n\n4 This  estimate  was  worked  out  by  the  Expert  Group  of  the  Planning  Commission,  India  and  accepted  by  the\n\nGovernment of India in 1997.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 3\n\n95 percent of the total export trade are  with  India. The consumer price index  of Bhutan for food\narticles, at the end of 1993 was 313 (December 1979=100), which rose to 438.1 for the month of\nDecember 1997, a rise of 40 percent.  Accordingly, the amount required to meet the expenditure\nper  month  per  person  that  is  equal  to  2,400  calories  per  day  is  approximately  Nu504  for\nDecember 1998.\n\n11.\nFrom  the  field  observations  and  the  socioeconomic  survey,  it  has  been  possible  to\ndistinguish the poor from the better-off in the rural villages by the structure of their houses, the\nsize of their farm plots, and the nature of their economic activities. The villages to be electrified\nunder  the  Project  have  on  average  30  households  of  5-10  people  each.  Based  on  the\nsocioeconomic  survey  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  1)  about  70  percent  of  the\nhouseholds are living below the poverty line (see profile of consumers in Table A15).\n\n12.\nThe  higher  income  households  have  average  incomes  of  about  $300-400  per  annum,\nand live in large, traditionally built houses constructed of wood and concrete, with large wooden-\nframe windows. The houses have corrugated iron or tile roofing, and a  large open  area under\nthe roof. These households permanently farm two or more hectares and have a dozen or more\ncattle, horses, and mules. Their farm incomes are  supplemented  by buying  and  selling  village\nproducts and handicrafts or by making small loans to neighbors. The homes often have access\nto running water on or nearby the premises and an outside latrine. In villages already electrified,\neach household may have 10 or more light bulbs, space heating, a rice cooker, and a radio.\n\n13.\nThe poor households in a typical village covered by the Project have an average income\nof  about  $144  per  annum  or  Nu504  per  person  per  month,  derived  almost  exclusively  from\nsubsistence  farming.  They  supplement  their  incomes  through  the  production  of  handicrafts,\nmainly  traditional  weaving.  The  houses  are  of  very  low  quality,  constructed  mainly  of  woven\nsiding  and  thatched  roofs.  Unless  a  smokeless  stove  has  been  installed,  cooking  inside  the\nhouse  fills  the  interior  with  smoke.  There  are  typically  one  or  two  small  rooms  with  earthen\nfloors, and no sanitation or water supply facilities are available on the premises. Water must be\ncarried  from  a  nearby  stream  or  other  source.  The  households  cultivate  less  than  one-half\nhectare and normally do not own any livestock.\n\nE.\n\nImpact on Poor Households\n\n14.\nApproximately 70 percent of the project beneficiaries are households below the poverty\nline  and  live  in  subsistence  economy  with  small  cash  incomes  from  selling  crops  such  as\nvegetables,  mandarins,  potatoes,  asparagus,  and  apples.  Some  money  also  flows  into  rural\ncommunities as remittances from family members working in towns and from wage labor.\n\n15.\nThe survey on electrified households\u2019 shows rural electrification has a positive impact on\nthe  level  of  economic  activity  in  electrified  areas.  Most  businesses  in  these  areas  choose  to\nelectrify  and  use  electricity  primarily  for  lighting.  Impressions  collected  by  the  Mission\nconcerning the productive use of rural electrification in Thimphu district are generally consistent\nwith  the  survey  data.  There  was  uniform  evidence  that  rural  electrification  led  to  increases  in\neconomic activity. In several villages, small businesses such as shops, saw mills, and rice mills\ncame into existence after electrification.\n\n16.\nThe availability of electricity will become a stimulant to the creation of new rural industry\nand  commerce.  In  Bhutan,  agricultural  processing  in  fact  is  the  main  direct  productive  use  of\nelectricity in  rural areas\u2014grain grinding, flour  milling,  rice husking,  and production  of  seed  oil.\nThe  productive  use  of  electricity  will  increase  employment  opportunities  and  reduce  rural  to\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 4\n\nurban  migration.  Furthermore,  the  supply  of  electricity  to  these  lower  income  households  is\nexpected  to  enhance  their  income-earning  potential,  as  weaving  and  other  cottage  industry\nactivities can continue at night.\n\nF. \n\nImpact on Women\n\n17.\nFocus group  discussions  with  women  indicate  that they benefit  substantially  from  rural\nelectrification,  as  they  spend  more  time  in  the  household  and  use  improved  lighting  and  any\nhousehold  appliances  more.  Electrification  in  flourmills  and  other  grain  and  food  processing\nfacilities  also  reduce  women\u2019s  workload  in  the  home.  Furthermore,  they  also  mentioned  that\nelectrification  of  health  clinics,  schools,  as  well  as  better  security  from  street  lighting,  also\nbenefited them and their children significantly.\n\n18.\nBecause  collecting  wood  is  mostly  women\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  work  in  each  household,\nwomen  will  benefit  substantially  from  rural  electrification.  Furthermore,  using  fuelwood  for\ncooking and heating  causes  respiratory  diseases  among  women  and  children  as  they  usually\nstay in their houses longer than men  do.  In addition, electrification  in  ricemills  and other grain\nand food processing facilities also reduce women\u2019s workload in the home.\n\n19.\nTo  ensure  that  women  and  men  are  participating  equally  in  the  Project,  gender\nconsideration has been addressed during the socioeconomic survey and Fact-Finding Mission.\nThe data collected during the socioeconomic survey of electrified and nonelectrified households\nincluded  information  regarding  the  ownership  of  households.  The  survey  data  show  that  over\n30 percent of the household owners are women, indicating that women have social esteem and\nstatus (the property is by way of inheritance). Therefore, they have always enjoyed equal status\nand the same level of freedom as men, according to the laws of the land.5\n\n20.\nIt is pertinent to note that women\u2019s participation in household earning is significant. Both\nfrom  the  point  of  view  of  the  quantum  of  work  done,  as  well  as  income  earned,  women\u2019s\ninvolvement  is  equally  present.  As  far  as  community  participation  and  decision  making  is\nconcerned, it is understood that women are actively involved. Their participation in the decision-\nmaking  process,  especially  in  grassroots  community  meetings  (zomdus)  is  as  high  as\n70 percent.6  They also participate  actively  at  the  district  and  village  development  committees.\nWomen\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  process  is  reported  to  be  significantly  high  at  the\ncommunity level and the Government is promoting it at the district and cluster of villages levels.\n\nG.\n\nImpact on Community\n\n21.\nIn  addition  to  direct  enhancement  of  household  welfare,  policy  objectives  of  rural\nelectrification  emphasize  social  impacts  of  overall  benefit  to  the  community.  The  use  of\nelectricity by community services and positive impacts on reduction of population growth, rural-\nurban migration and modern lifestyle are usually expected to be substantial. Rural electrification\nwill be used by rural schools, and health clinics, and for street lighting and public buildings. The\nfact  that  there  is  a  wider  range  of  goods  and  services  available  is  also  a  benefit  to  the\ncommunity.  Less  tangibly,  the  availability  of  an  electricity  supply  tends  to  provide  rural\ncommunities with a psychological boost, improving the moral and civic pride of local people.\n\n                                                       \n5 Royal Government of Bhutan. 1998. The Middle Path: National Environment Strategy for Bhutan.\n6 Royal Government  of Bhutan. Eighth Five-Year Plan document.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 5\n\nThe Project will help extend the supply of electricity in rural areas to 16 out of 20 districts\n22.\nand  thereby  will  contribute  to  a  significant  improvement  in  the  quality  of  life  of  5,437  rural\nhouseholds\u2014children  being  primary  beneficiaries.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  provide  100\nsolar  panels  to  remote  areas  in  3  districts,  particularly  for  public  facilities  such  as  schools,\nhospitals,  and  monasteries.  Therefore,  this  Project  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  rural\nareas  by  facilitating  economic  opportunity  through  consumptive  as  well  as  productive  uses  of\nelectricity.\n\nH.\n\nWillingness to Pay and Affordability of Rural Electrification by Households\n\n23.\nBecause  the  basic  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  welfare  of  the  rural\npopulation,  it  was  important  to  conduct  an  analysis  on  what  fraction  of  rural  households  can\nafford  electricity  supply.  The  socioeconomic  survey  has  been  conducted  to  (i)  analyze    what\nnonelectrified  households  currently  spend  on  energy  sources  that  substitute  for  electricity;\n(ii) analyze  expenditures  on  electricity  by  residential  consumers  in  electrified  areas;  and\n(iii) conduct surveys of potential consumers to know the extent they are willing and able to pay\nfor electricity.\n\n24.\nFurther  insight  into  the  affordability  of  electricity  supply  can  be  obtained  by  surveying\nhouseholds as to their willingness and ability to pay for electricity supply. This was done by the\nJune  1998  survey  (footnote  1)  in  at  least  two  nonelectrified  villages  each  in  the  Western,\nCentral,  and  Eastern  regions.  Approximately  95  percent  of  the  households  indicated  a\nwillingness to pay for electricity based on  the amount  of  the  monthly bill.7 While the  rest  have\npreferred a ceiling on the bill amount, which is much higher (3 to 4 times for metered consumers\nand  still  higher  for  unmetered  ones).  This  percentage  varied  considerably  between  villages.\nDifferences  in  average  village  income  levels  are  clearly  responsible  for  part  of  the  observed\nvariation in willingness to pay.\n\nAt  the  current  level  of  consumption,  the  lowest  income  groups  spend  only  about\n25.\n3.2 percent  of  their  income  on  electricity.  Since  the  energy  consumption  pattern  across  the\nincome groups is only marginally at variance, and constitute a low share of total income and/or\nexpenditure,  the  higher  income  groups  can  pay  at  least  four  times  the  current  tariff  for  their\nlevels of consumption on parity with low income counterparts.\n\n26.\nThe survey indicates that 87 percent of households are ready to pay for the initial cost of\nhouse  wiring,  service  connection,  and  the  initial  fee.  The  poorest  households  will  only  be\nrequired to pay Nu250 each for an  electricity  kit8  as deposit, and  the  Government  will  provide\nthe connection free of charge. A household that wants further extension of wiring may need to\nspend  approximately  Nu1,500.  Thus  a  total  cost  of  Nu1,750  needs  to  be  spent  by  the\nconsumers in the low-income group if they want extended house wiring. For poor nonelectrified\nhouseholds, these costs would represent a half to one month\u2019s income.\n\n27. When  asked  whether  they  would  require  a  loan,  nearly  27  percent  of  households\nindicated that they would require loans ranging between Nu5,000 to Nu15,000 to buy electricity\nappliances  as  well  as  to  meet  house  wiring.  Villagers  could  apply  for  a  loan  from  Bhutan\nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC) through the rural credit scheme if he/she has some\nland  or  other  property  as  collateral.  When  applying  for  a  loan,  a  villager  will  usually  receive\n\n                                                       \n7 The amount of monthly electricity bill for poorest household without a meter depends on the number of power points\nand light points. One light point will cost Nu5 and one power point Nu25. A poor household usually has 3 light points\nand one power point. The total amount of monthly electricity bill will be Nu40.\n\n8 The actual cost for the kit is about Nu1,500.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 6\n\naround  Nu50,000  per  hectare  of  land  or  equivalent  of  other  properties.  The  procedure  for\napplying for credit is not difficult and it takes one to two months to get the credit.9 The interest\nrate  is  13 percent  per  year.  However,  during  the  focus  group  discussion,  some  women\nmentioned  that  for  loans  of  small  amounts  (maximum  Nu5,000),  they  can  borrow  from  their\nrelatives or neighbors.\n\nI.\n\nImpact of Tariff Adjustment to Poor Households\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  is  to  guarantee  access  to  basic  services  to  the  entire\n28.\npopulation.  Consequently,  once  a  village  is  electrified,  all  houses  are  provided  access  to\nelectricity  albeit  at  different  levels  of  services,  with  only  one  or  two  light  bulbs  for  the  poorer\nhouseholds.\n\n29.\nThe  current  electricity tariff for  residential  and  industrial  consumers  is  Nu0.60 per  kWh\nfor urban consumers and Nu0.50 per kWh for rural consumers. The Government plans to revise\nand increase the tariff gradually based on socioeconomic conditions, cost of power generation\nand supply, and impact on domestic industry. Such adjustments will give rise to the sustainable\ndevelopment of the power sector and facilitate the future corporatization of DOP. The next tariff\nadjustment  is proposed at  Nu0.70 per  kWh  and  will be effective on  1 January  2000  for  urban\nand industrial customers. The introduction of three-block tariff, which includes a lifeline tariff for\npoor consumers will create cross-subsidies within the electricity subsector (e.g., high income to\nlow income and intersector) and it is likely to ensure proper social balance.\n\n30.\nThe  present  level  of  tariff  for  rural  consumers  is  highly  subsidized.  Though  there  is  a\nneed to increase the tariff from the point of view of the sustainability of DOP, the tariff structure\naddresses  the  issue  of  poverty,  by  proposing  a  lifeline  tariff  for  low-end  consumers.  A  poor\nhousehold uses the lifeline unmetered tariff, and each household could have maximum 3 bulbs\nand  one  power  point.  Regardless  of  electricity  power  being  used  under  the  current  tariff\nstructure  using  the  kit,  they  pay  a  total  of  Nu40  per  month  (around  2.0  percent  of  household\nexpenditure for the lowest income category).\n\n31.\nAlso,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  average  amount  spent  on  fuel  (in  nonelectrified\nareas) and on electricity (in electrified rural areas) is a  very  small proportion of  the  income as\nwell  as  expenditure  (around  1  percent).  The  household  survey  also  indicated  the  consumer\u2019s\nwillingness and ability to pay (the response showed that the consumers would not be reducing\ntheir present level of consumption even if the tariff were increased by 50 percent). It is thus felt\nthat  the  recommended  tariff  increases and  structure  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  rural\nand poor consumers.\n\nJ.\n\nLand Acquisition and Compensation\n\n32.\nAlthough  small  amounts  of  land  will  be  acquired  and  disturbed  for  the  installation  of\nsupporting poles,  most of the  poles  will  be  implemented along  the  roadside for ease of future\nmaintenance. The Project will not necessitate resettlement of any people. The survey indicates\nthat the beneficiaries in the project area are willing to allot the necessary land for poles when it\nencroaches on their property. Small portions of land may be necessary for transformers. Some\nof  the  land  needed  for  this  purpose  may  be  privately  owned  and  acquired  from  its  owners.\nAdequate market-based compensation will be paid for any disturbance to, or loss of, productive\nland.\n                                                       \n9  The  length  of  loan  processing  depends  on  the  success  rate  of  repayment  from  the  fellow  villagers  who  borrowed\n\nmoney from BDCF.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 7\n\nPresently the Project has no particular negative impact and requires no remedial action.\n33.\nDOP will maintain data and progress reports on implementation of land acquisition, a summary\nreport will be sent to the Bank annually for review and comments.\n\nK.\n\nIndigenous People\n\n34.\nBhutan has some ethnic minority groups, though insignificant in number, and they live in\nisolated areas. Prominent among them are the Yak herders, who temporarily migrate from their\ninhabitancy  to  lower  altitudes  during  winter.  These  along  with  other  ethnic  groups  like  Doya,\nLaya Lingzi, and Merak Sektang, and constitute less than 0.2 percent of the total population. As\nthe indigenous people live in areas that will not be covered by the Project, there will not be any\nnegative impact of the Project on them. Therefore, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan is\nnot required.\n\nL.\n\nParticipatory Project Performance Monitoring System\n\nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  in\n35.\nassociation  with  DOP.  The  community-based  organizations  in  the  Gewok  will  verify  the\neffectiveness  of  project  activities  and  outputs,  as  well  as  the  reactions  of  the  intended\nbeneficiaries.  Regular  feedback  will  be  provided  through  the  project  implementation  units\nregarding the effectiveness of the Project and the necessary changes that may be required mid\ncourse. Regular monitoring reports will be included in a quarterly report prepared by DOP.\n\n36.\nDOP will conduct monitoring to enable postevaluation of the Project, and also to improve\nthe  planning  for  future  rural  electrification  projects.  The  proposed  project  performance\nevaluation  and  measurement  indicators  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines for Project Performance Management System. DOP will confirm, in consultation with\nthe Bank, a set of performance indicators and performance targets to monitor the benefits of the\nProject at the time of loan inception.\n\n37.\nThe  Bank  through  its  TA  on  Power  Sector  Review  to  be  implemented  in  2002  will\nconduct comprehensive social impact monitoring and evaluation after completion of the Project\nto  determine  (i)  total  number  of  connected  consumers  in  various  categories,  number  of  total\npotential consumers in those categories resident in the service area, and the connection ratios\nfor  those  categories  at  various  dates  after  commissioning;  (ii)  average  consumption  rates  for\nconsumers  in  each  category;  (iii)  description  of  new  economic  activities  induced  by  the\nintroduction  of  electricity;  (iv)  description  of  existing  economic  activities  that  have  switched  to\nusing electricity and thereby become more efficient and productive; (v) estimated total value of\neconomic activities  induced by the  rural electrification;  (vi)  estimate of average  income  levels;\nand  (vii)  survey  of  the  perceived  importance  of  various  types  of  benefits  created  by  rural\nelectrification, such as improved employment opportunities, increased income levels, improved\nquality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  and  improved  health  standards.  It  will  also  carry  out\nconcurrent  surveys  of  average  income  levels  in  some  representative  and  comparable\ncommunities  that  are  not electrified  to  determine  the  incremental  impact of  rural  electrification\non  income  levels  and  economic  activities.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  conduct  monitoring\nand evaluation of the land acquisition activities, entitlements, time frame, and budget set out for\nthis process.\n\n\fTable A.15: Consumer Profile\n\nHouseholds in income category group\n\nIndustries, \n\nSolar Panel\n\nDistrict Name\n\n0-2000\n\n2001-4000 4001-8000\n\n8001-25000\n\nCommercial & Public \nInst.

The Project will\ncommence in September 1999, and physical construction is expected to start in April 2001 and\nbe completed by September 2003. The life of the network expansion plans is assumed to be 25\nyears.\n\nB.\n\nCost Assumptions\n\n1.\n\nCapital and Operation and Maintenance Costs\n\n2.\nThe capital cost for the Project has  been estimated  in dollars for the foreign exchange\ncomponent  and  ngultrum  (Nu)  for  the  local  currency  components  at  1999  price  levels.  To\ncalculate  the  project  rate  of  return,  the  capital  cost  is  net  of  interest  during  construction  and\nprovision for price contingency. The Project is not subject to any taxes.\n\n3.\nThe annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the Project are estimated to be\n1 percent of the capital costs. System losses (during transmission and distribution) are assumed\nto be 15 percent as the end consumption will be mainly at the low voltage level.\n\n4.\nThe  economic  cost  of  the  Project  is  derived  from  its  financial  costs  measured  at  the\nborder  prices  where  the  nontradable  components  were  converted  to  world  price  numeraire\nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.9. The shadow wage rate for skilled labor is taken as 1.0\nas skilled workers are generally in short supply in Bhutan, and the prevailing market  wages  in\nthe  project  area  are  taken  as  corresponding  to  their  supply  price.  The  conversion  factor  for\nunskilled  labor  was  assumed  at  0.73.  Based  on  the  proportion  of  the  traded  and  nontraded\nitems and skilled and unskilled labor, the overall conversion factor comes to 0.955.\n\n2.\n\nCost of Energy\n\n5.\nThe  economic  cost  of  energy  has  been  estimated  at  about  Nu1.37  per  kilowatt-hour\n(kWh) calculated based on the weighted sum of the cost of energy generation at marginal costs\n(about  Nu0.16/kWh)  and  lost  exports  to  India  (Nu1.50  per  kWh).  Bhutan  exports  its  power  to\nIndia  after  satisfying  its  domestic  needs.  At  present,  domestic  consumption  represents  about\n20 percent of energy  generation,  and the  balance  is  exported  to  India. With  the  Project,  extra\npower supply for domestic use will come from lower  exports  to  India although  the  incremental\npower supply required with the Project is quite low, it accounts for only about 2-3 percent of total\ngeneration capacity. However, with the additional generation capacity coming on stream in the\nfuture, the ratio of domestic sales to export sales will be further reduced. Conservatively, it was\nestimated that the overall domestic sales would represent only about 10 percent of total energy\nsales. The economic cost of energy was assumed to remain constant in real terms.\n\n\fAppendix 17, page 2\n\nC.\n\nBenefit Assumptions\n\n1.\n\nDomestic Consumers\n\nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  6,038  potential  consumers  in  various  districts.  The\n6.\nmarket  mix  consists  of  predominantly  household  consumers  together  with  associated\ncommercial,  social,  and  government  sector  consumers  such  as  shops,  schools,  basic  health\nunits,  and  monasteries.  The  economic  benefits  composed  of  the  nonincremental  and\nincremental benefits. The nonincremental benefit represents the cost savings from the displaced\nuse  of  alternative  energy  due  to  the  Project.  In  this  case,  it  is  primarily  kerosene  for  lighting,\nwhich is fully imported. This benefit was estimated at 80 percent of the total sales forecast and\nwas valued at the economic cost of kerosene. The incremental benefits is benefit from induced\nelectricity consumption (estimated at 20 percent of the sales forecast), which is valued based on\nwillingness to pay, or the weighted average price of the prevailing electricity tariffs and financial\nprice of kerosene.\n\nThe financial price of kerosene is Nu4.40 per liter as compared with the economic price\n7.\nof Nu8.6 per liter. At present, all the kerosene is obtained from India, and the price paid by the\nconsumers  in  Bhutan  is  the  same  price  paid  in  India,  which  is  highly  subsidized.  Since  the\npetroleum  pricing  of  India  (to  Bhutan)  is  based  on  major  cross  subsidies  across  consumers,\nconsumers of kerosene are  actually  cross-subsidized  by  other  consumers  of  petrol and diesel\nused  for  transportation  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Therefore,  as  India  is  selling\npetroleum products at roughly the same rate in Bhutan, this cross subsidy impact also applies to\nBhutan. The economic benefit calculation assumed that the  kerosene  subsidy  (from  India)  will\nbe phased out at the time the Project is commissioned. This is in line with Government of India\nplans  to  fully  deregulate  kerosene  from  2002  onward.  The  replacement  value  derived  from\nkerosene is obtained based  on  the  assumption  that a  kerosene  lamp  is assumed to  consume\n0.025  liter  per  hour,  which  is  equal  to  a  40-watt  incandescent  bulb.  The  cost  of  owning  and\nmaintaining  the  kerosene  lamps  and  electric  bulbs  have  been  considered  to  be  of  the  same\norder and excluded from the analysis.\n\n2. \n\nMotive Power Users\n\n8.\nIn case of motive power users like village rice mills and saw mills, other industries and\nagricultural pumping, which presently use diesel engine-driven devices, the economic benefit is\nestimated considering the net savings that accrue to the economy due to (i) reduction in use of\ndiesel (import price) and (ii) reduction in capital (and maintenance) cost, i.e., electric motor cost\nversus diesel engine cost.  The  savings  in fuel  cost  is  estimated at  Nu4.24  per  kWh based  on\nfuel consumption per kWh of 0.4 liters (including lubricant oil equivalent) and the cost of diesel\nper  liter  of  about  Nu10.60.  Savings  in  capital  and  O&M  cost  is  estimated  at  Nu0.34  per  kWh\nbased on the following assumptions: (i) the capital cost per kW for diesel engines is Nu5,500 as\ncompared  with  Nu3,500  for  an  electric  motor;  (ii)  a  diesel  engine  has  10-year  economic  life,\nwhile an electric motor has  about 15-year  life;  (iii)  the  O&M  cost per  kW of a diesel  engine  is\nhigher at 10 percent of capital cost as compared with only 4 percent for an electric motor; and\n(iv)  2,400  hours  of  operation  per  annum.  The  standard  rating  of  a  diesel  engine  used  is\n7.5 horsepower (5.5 kW).\n\n\fAppendix 17, page 3\n\nTable A17: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(Nu million)\n\nFiscal Capital Energy O&M\nCost\nYear\n\nCost\n\nCost\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nEconomic Benefits\nHousehold Ind'l/Comm Public\n\nTotal\n\nNet\n\nBenefits Cashflow\n\n1999  \n   \n2000\n42.92\n \n2001 215.45\n2002 172.53\n \n2003  \n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n\n \n\n0\n     \n8.84\n   \n18.43\n   \n22.42\n   \n24.57\n   \n25.71\n   \n26.91\n   \n28.18\n   \n29.50\n30.90\n   \n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n32.37\n   \n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n32.37\n   \n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n   \n32.37\n\n \n\n0\n1.29\n2.15\n3.02\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n4.31\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n \n     \n   \n   \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n42.92\n225.57\n193.12\n25.43\n28.88\n30.02\n31.22\n32.48\n33.81\n35.21\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n36.68\n\n0\n         \n11.87\n         \n25.15\n         \n36.64\n         \n42.35\n         \n44.88\n         \n47.56\n         \n50.39\n         \n53.40\n         \n56.59\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n         \n59.97\n\n0\n           \n11.10\n           \n22.86\n           \n23.55\n           \n24.25\n           \n24.98\n           \n25.73\n           \n26.50\n           \n27.30\n           \n28.12\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n           \n28.96\n\n0\n       \n4.82\n       \n9.92\n     \n10.21\n     \n10.52\n     \n10.83\n     \n11.15\n     \n11.48\n     \n11.82\n     \n12.17\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n     \n12.54\n\n \n\n0\n        \n27.78\n        \n57.93\n        \n70.40\n        \n77.12\n        \n80.69\n        \n84.44\n        \n88.38\n        \n92.52\n        \n96.88\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n      \n101.46\n\n \n     \n   \n   \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n\n(42.92)\n(197.79)\n(135.19)\n44.96\n48.24\n50.67\n53.21\n55.89\n58.71\n61.67\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n64.78\n\nO&M = Operation and Maintenance\nSource: Staff Estimates\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\nNet Present Value (10%)\n\n13.0%\n75.2\n\n       \n\nSensitivity Analysis\n      Base Case\n1.
