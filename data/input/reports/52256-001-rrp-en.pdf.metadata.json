THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan and a proposed results-based grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Naryn Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Development  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  the  Naryn  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nDevelopment Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will contribute to a portion of \nthe national Strategy for Development of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems in Settlements \n(SDWSSSS) program, 2016\u20132026 to achieve inclusive and reliable access to safe water supply \nand  sanitation  (WSS)  services.1 ADB  financing  will  target  infrastructure  expansion  in  rural \ncommunities  of  Naryn  province,  while  building  capacities  of  WSS  service  operators  and \ninstitutions across the country to enhance service delivery and performance of the subsector. \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central and West Asia and its \nestimated gross domestic product per capita is $1,280.2 An estimated 22.4% of the country\u2019s 6.2 \nmillion people live below the national poverty line.3 The concentration of poverty in the country is \nhigher in rural areas and greatest in mountainous areas, where more than half of the population \nis poor. The Kyrgyz Republic is also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including \nfrequent drought and early snowfall, increasing the risk of water scarcity, frequent landslides, and \nfloods, particularly for poor populations. \n \n4.  Access to safe drinking WSS in rural areas remains a significant challenge. Poor water \nquality and sanitation costs the country over $100 million annually, including productivity losses.4 \nMost of the rural WSS infrastructure was built in 1960s and has exceeded its design life, with little \nmaintenance resulting in low-quality services. In 2014, only one-quarter of rural households had \npiped household connections,5 and about 73% of rural households had intermittent water supply. \nThere are 200 water supply intakes without sanitary protection setback zones and they lack \ntreatment facilities, exposing people to preventable diseases. Rural sanitation coverage is only \n10% and characterized primarily by unimproved sanitation facilities. The key issues confronting \nrural WSS in the Kyrgyz Republic are (i) insufficient resources because of inadequate tariffs, (ii) \nweak capacity of WSS service operators, and (iii) limited operation and maintenance (O&M) and \ncapital investment. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2016.

In  March  2016,  the \ngovernment approved its national SDWSSSS program, covering all seven provinces in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The goal of the national program is to increase water supply coverage from 40% to 90% \nand sanitation coverage from 10% to 70% by 2026. The nationwide program is also anchored in \nthe National Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u20132040 which prioritizes access \nto clean drinking water and sanitary facilities.6 The national SDWSSSS program provides a clear \nframework to guide sector development by outlining key areas and activities in developing urban \nand rural water supply and sewerage systems. It also contains measures to conduct analysis and \nmonitoring. The resolution includes an implementation plan for ongoing and planned projects \ntotaling $420 million with financing sourced from the state budget (6.4%) and primarily from \nexternal sources (93.6%). The national program expenditure framework consists of an annual \nbudget of $63 million during 2018\u20132020, which comprises development partner funding (90%) \nthrough loans and grants. Government counterpart funding is 10% ($6 million per year). \n \n6.  Strong commitment to delivering results in the rural water supply and sanitation \nsubsector. The government has demonstrated a high level of commitment from 2016 and has \nbeen proactive in attracting development partners, who have committed $393 million to support \nthe national SDWSSSS program during 2016\u20132026. The national program is benefiting from \nassistance from bilateral partners, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nEuropean Union, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank. In November 2018, ADB \napproved the Issyk-Kul Wastewater Management Project to upgrade and expand the existing \nwastewater systems in Balykchy and Karakol cities. \n  \n7.  Improvements in institutional arrangements in the subsector. The Department of \nDrinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development (DDWSSD) under the State Agency for Water \nResources, established in 2012, is in charge of the WSS policy, sector reforms, and execution of \nthe  SDWSSSS.  The  DDWSSD  has  been  actively  seeking  improvements  to  institutional \narrangements and has demonstrated a willingness for change in the subsector. The Community \nDevelopment and Investment Agency (ARIS), a government agency was established in 2003, \nwith  a  mandate  to  support  local  governments  to  deliver  new  and  rehabilitated  assets;7 \nimplementation of investment plans; and provision of technical, administrative, and financial \nassistance.  Local governments are the asset owners and community drinking water users\u2019 unions \n(CDWUUs) are the service providers. However, only one-quarter of the 633 CDWUUs are \noperational, while the rest are unable to continue operations because of the lack of revenue and \ntechnical specialists. The government is moving toward a professionally oriented model, and \nformalizing these as water supplies and utilities services entities (WSUs) in accordance with the \nLaw  of  Local  Self-Government  (2018).  This  new  model  will  support  WSUs  to  improve \nsustainability and have access to public funding (e.g., transfers). \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n8.  The SDWSSSS aims to improve access to safe rural WSS and is aligned with Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  1, 5,  6,  10,  12,  and  13. The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  is \nembedded  in  the  SDWSSSS  program  and  will  enhance  development  effectiveness.  The \ngovernment requested support from multiple development partners to implement the SDWSSSS \n                                                \n6  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018. National Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u20132040. \nBishkek. \n7  ARIS was established in October 2003 and is governed by a statutory supervisory board composed of seven national \ngovernment representatives, seven local government representatives, and seven nongovernment organization \nrepresentatives. Currently, ARIS employs 311 staff. \n \n ", "3 \nprogram and allocated each of the seven provinces to different development partners to expedite \nefficiency and enhance coordination. The government requested ADB\u2019s assistance in Naryn. \n \n9.  Naryn is a mountainous province and one of the poorest in the Kyrgyz Republic, with a \npoverty rate of 29% in 2017. Naryn\u2019s resident population was estimated at 287,000 in 2018 across \nNaryn township and 165 villages (footnote 3). In 2009, the urban population share was 15.3%.8 \nThe ADB-supported Bishkek\u2013Torugart road traverses through Naryn and connects Bishkek to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), providing regional connectivity with Central Asian neighbors \nand opportunities for rural development.9 Most villages in Naryn have unprotected water sources. \nIncidences of waterborne diseases are high in Naryn. The program will cover 64,000 people in \nNaryn  and  will  support  the  design,  construction,  and  rehabilitation  of  WSS  facilities;  and \ninstitutional capacity to provide sustainable and safe WSS services across 31 program villages. \nIn addition, the program will ensure that detailed designs are completed for 12 program villages \nand ready them for implementation when additional financing becomes available. \n \n10.  Alignment with ADB strategic priorities. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030, supporting four of the seven operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, (ii) promoting rural development  and food security, (iii) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and (iv) building climate and disaster resilience.10 The \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2019\u2013\n2021 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022, \nwhich calls for equality between regions, and improved WSS services.11 The program is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Water Policy and Water Operational Plan.12 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s assistance from 2000 to 2013 included two subsector projects \ntotaling $66 million.13 In 2000, ADB approved the Community-Based Infrastructure Services \nSector Project (CBISSP), which suffered from major cost overruns and poor execution of works. \nTo rectify deficiencies, in 2009 ADB approved supplementary financing. However, only about 10% \nof  planned  subprojects  were  completed  and,  because  of  procurement  irregularities  and \nnoncompliance with ADB procedures, the project was canceled in 2013.14 From 2013 to 2018, \n                                                \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Manila. \n \n ", "4 \nADB  provided  capacity  development  TA  to  the  DDWSSD  for  developing  the  SDWSSSS, \nreviewing technical standards, benchmarking, and improving the institutional framework.15  \n \n12.  The main lessons learned from ADB\u2019s overall involvement during 2000\u20132013 are as \nfollows: (i) frequent turnover of responsible authorities reflects a lack of government ownership \nand commitment to deliver results, (ii) past institutional frameworks should be examined closely \nto evaluate effectiveness and identify weaknesses, (iii) due diligence should be conducted on \ngovernment entities, and (iv) adequate ADB resources should be made available to bolster \nimplementation. The RBL program incorporates these lessons as follows: \n(i)  Strong government ownership. The government has demonstrated ownership \nof  the  subsector  through  the  establishment  of  the  national  program  and \ncommitment  to  deliver  results.  Several  development  partners  have  active \noperations supporting the national program, which are progressing well. Through \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  intervention,  the  government  has  included  results-based \nfinancing for the sanitation component and introduced verification protocols. The \nRBL is established within the broader national program and will support the \nSDWSSSS program until it ends in 2026. \n(ii)  Strengthened  institutional  arrangements.  The  executing  agency  for  the \nCBISSP was originally the Department of Rural Water Supply under the Ministry \nof Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry. Subsequently, the \nexecuting agency arrangements changed four times during the implementation \nperiod. These changes stifled project performance and led to poor development \neffectiveness. Similarly, the implementing agency originally was a joint-project \nmanagement unit within the National Agency for Local Self-Governance that later \nproved to be ineffective. Overall, the subsector lacked an effective and stable \ngovernance framework and did not have a central agency for policy leadership. \nADB\u2019s TA supported the government in establishing strong and competent sector \ninstitutions. The RBL program\u2019s executing agency will be the DDWSSD, and the \nprogram implementing agency will be ARIS. The DDWSSD and ARIS have been \nkey stakeholders in the rural WSS subsector; ARIS has clear accountability for \ndelivering the externally financed projects. The DDWSSD was not part of CBISSP, \nwhereas  ARIS\u2019s  involvement  was  through  2011\u20132012.  The  noncompliance \nsituation emerged before the transition to ARIS, and ARIS was not able to rectify \nrelated issues, including quality technical supervision of works that had been \nimplemented, within the short 10-month period during which it was the executing \nagency. Currently, ARIS is responsible for the implementation of 10 externally \nfinanced projects including those funded by the World Bank. Essential resources \nhave been provided to strengthen the capacity of ARIS. The program design has \nbenefitted  from  development  coordination  through  the  Development  Partners \nCoordination Council, and directly with development agencies. The RBL program \nuses  harmonized  results  framework  with  the  World  Bank  to  encourage \ncomplementary activities to improve sector governance and accountability. The \nprogram  design  allows  for  scaling  up,  if  and  when  additional  financing  or \ncofinancing  becomes  available.  In  particular,  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  has \nexpressed interest in supporting the RBL program. \n(iii)  Completed due diligence during program processing. The DDWSSD has been \nthe lead policy and planning institution for the subsector since 2016, and is \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Drinking  Water  Law  (1999).  The \nDDWSSD has dedicated staff and provides program governance and coordination \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy. Manila. \n ", "5 \namong the stakeholders. The absence of a strong central agency was one of the \nmain reasons for the slow pace of governance, institution, policy, and regulatory \nreforms. ADB assessments have concluded that the DDWSSD and ARIS have \ndeveloped  the  essential  capacity  in  project  management,  safeguards, \nprocurement, and financial management that can be used to support the program. \nProgress  reviews  will  provide  indication  of  the  potential  (i)  to  scale  up \nimplementation efforts across other villages in Naryn and (ii) to broaden the \napplication of program systems, such as the program procurement manual and the \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, to other provinces. \n(iv)  Strengthened  capacity  and  program  systems.  The  RBL  program  will  be \ncomplemented by an attached TA and a small expenditure financing facility (SEFF) \nactivity to support institutional strengthening of the program systems and key \ninstitutions.16 The additional resources will support the recruitment of a credible \nindependent  verification  agent  (IVA)  and  provide  program  start-up  and \nimplementation services to mitigate the program\u2019s operating environment risks, \npromote delivery of critical results through the effective use of disbursement-linked \nindicators (DLIs), enhance the sustainability of RBL program benefits, and assess \nopportunities for scaling up the program. \n \n13.  Results-based lending modality. The RBL instrument responds to the government\u2019s \nrequest to shift the focus from investment transactions toward the RBL modality to incentivize the \nachievement of results, support financing a slice of its SDWSSSS expenditure program, and \nfurther strengthen the institutional capacity of the DDWSSD and ARIS to promote sustainability \nof  the  program.  ARIS  has  experience  with  the  implementation  of  results-based  financing \nmechanisms, specifically in the rural sanitation subsector (footnote 4). Due diligence assessments \nprovide reasonable assurance that the government\u2019s program systems can deliver verifiable \nresults. Institutional strengthening actions proposed in procurement, M&E, and fiduciary practices \nwill mitigate related risks and support program implementation efficiency. The RBL is effective in \nmanaging large number of small procurement packages. It also provides a good platform for \ncapacity development and technical and policy discussions, particularly in areas to (i) achieve \nprogram results and DLI targets, (ii) enhance program systems on the basis of the outcome of \ntechnical, fiduciary, and program safeguard-system assessments, (iii) strengthen accountability \nof basic service provision to rural residents, and (iv) leverage cofinancing. The government \nconfirmed its strong commitment to this instrument. \n \n14.  ADB value addition.

Two outputs will contribute to the outcome: \n(i)  Output  1:  Water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  expanded  and \nsanitation solutions piloted. The program will include the following infrastructure \ncomponents: (a) safe water sources, water storage, and treatment and disinfection \nsystems; (b) distribution networks for the target population of 64,000; (c) gender-\nsensitive safe water and sanitation facilities in selected kindergartens, schools, and \nhealth facilities; and (d) piloting of non-networked household sanitation solutions. \n(ii)  Output 2: Institutional capacities strengthened for enhanced sustainability \nin the rural water supply services and sanitation subsector. Output 2 focuses \non  institutional  measures  to  strengthen  WSS  systems  and  improve  service \ndelivery. It will (a) establish and strengthen WSUs and secure at least 20% female \nparticipation across all WSUs by 2025, and 40% female participation in WSU-\nrelated  trainings  and  public  consultations;  (b)  deliver  financial  management \ntraining to further enhance internal control processes and procedures for ARIS and \nWSUs; (c) adopt and apply a procurement manual and a multiyear procurement \naction  plan;  and  (d)  develop  and  implement  an  M&E  framework  to  improve \nknowledge of asset inventory and data management. \n \n18.  Disbursement-linked and other result indicators. The program will track progress \nusing eight DLIs (Table 2) and two indicators not linked to disbursement.18 DLI 1 measures the \npopulation using water supply that meets national quality standards. DLI 2 monitors access to \ngender-sensitive safe water and sanitation facilities in selected schools, kindergartens, and health \nfacilities. The program will track progress against output 1 using the completion of detailed design \n(DLI 3) and water supply infrastructure from source, storage, and disinfection to piped networks \n(DLI 4); and the piloting of household sanitation (DLI 5). Under output 2, DLI 6 includes the \ndevelopment of a procurement manual, which is instrumental for institutional strengthening and \nimproving procurement practices; DLI 7 will track improved financial management capacity; and \nDLI 8 will track the establishment and performance of WSUs. The two indicators that are not \nlinked to disbursement address climate change risk assessments and a grievance redress \nmechanism, which is referred to in the Kyrgyz Republic as a beneficiary feedback mechanism \n(BFM). \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of  \nAllocated   Total ADB \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome \n1.

The program completion date is on 31 December 2027. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n27.  Program design. The program design is sound and the DLIs are critical indicators for \nachieving overall program results. The program design considers local conditions (such as \nweather), the need for gender-specific school and health facilities, community-based sanitation \nsolutions, and the need to have efficient and accountable rural WSS services. The program is \ndesigned to improve WSS reliability and sustainability. The program design places emphasis on \nensuring access to all, which is in line with the SDWSSSS, and is consistent with one of the \nnational development strategy objectives. International expertise will be engaged to support \nARIS\u2019s design review, construction supervision, and contract management. A technical auditor \nwill conduct regular audits to ensure that the as-built systems comply with specifications and that \nhigh-quality standards are maintained. Training will be provided to WSU staff to further enable \nsustainable service delivery, with a particular focus on building capacity to identify critical water \nquality risks. \n \n28.  The program will contribute to poverty reduction by improving health outcomes and \nreducing the time spent on water collection. It will directly benefit about 36,500 poor beneficiaries \nby providing better access to WSS services. It will especially alleviate women\u2019s poverty by \nreducing  the  time  spent  collecting  and  storing  water,  and  making  it  safe  for  household \nconsumption. Based on analyses of similar rural water schemes, the benefits are (i) reduced \nincidence of water-related diseases and (ii) decreased time spent collecting water and treating it \nin-house.24 \n \n29.  The WSS service operators currently charge low tariffs that do not cover O&M costs. \nPoverty surveys indicate that households are willing to pay much higher tariffs for clean water, \nwhich would be sufficient to cover O&M costs but not full replacement costs.25 The national \nprogram underscores the government\u2019s policy objective to create economically sustainable and \naffordable WSS services by establishing a market format with a reliable subsidy system for \nvulnerable groups. As the RBL program rehabilitates and commissions new schemes, local \ngovernments will establish WSUs to provide services and ensure proper O&M. The attached TA \nand SEFF activity will promote sustainable approaches and accountable arrangements and, \nthrough a public awareness campaign, service levels will encourage higher collection efficiency \nrates by the WSUs. Institutions and systems will be further strengthened, especially at the local \nlevel, to provide sufficient budget allocation for routine O&M, if needed. The attached TA and \nSEFF  will  be  provided  to  implement  efficient  operations,  including  developing  appropriate \nstrategies for billing and collection of tariffs. \n \n                                                \n24 Program Soundness Assessment; and Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB. 2019.

Given  existing  gender \ninequalities and women\u2019s role in water collection, housework, and childcare, the program will \nalleviate women\u2019s workload, free up time for productive activities and leisure, and meet water and \nhygiene needs for businesses headed by women. Gender is mainstreamed through DLI 2 and \nDLI 8 to promote (i) gender-sensitive infrastructure design (Appendix 3, Table A3.1), (ii) women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  management  structures,  and  (iii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  service-related \nconsultations. The PAP requires BFM and WSU trainings to promote gender awareness and \naction. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n31.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  ARIS  has  a  comprehensive  M&E  system  for \nexternally funded projects, including baseline surveys and infrastructure monitoring. ARIS has \nnine M&E specialists and a network of BFM specialists to report progress. ARIS has proven \nmonitoring capacity for reporting on project and program indicators.26 ARIS is also developing a \nrural WSS information system to support its M&E system. \n \n32.  Fiduciary systems. The financial management assessment of ARIS concluded that the \noverall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial,  based  on  specific  financial \nmanagement weaknesses identified in planning and budgeting, staffing, accounting and internal \ncontrol, and external audit. The implementation of a proposed financial management action plan \nwill reduce such risk. \n \n33.  The overall program procurement risk is assessed moderate. The Public Procurement \nLaw (2015) was found to be generally comprehensive and included open competitive bidding. \nThe  program  will  rely  on  the  RBL  program  procurement  system.27 ARIS  will  develop  a \nprocurement manual to ensure that procurement procedures and processes under the program \nmitigate procurement risks and meet ADB principles.28 \n \n34.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government, \nthe DDWSSD and ARIS. The government\u2019s anticorruption laws are comprehensive, and the \ninstitutional framework is assessed adequate. \n \n35.  The sustainability of the program is linked to the adequate operations of newly built \nsystems, particularly the maintenance of equipment and disinfection systems, which will be \ninstalled at all production sites. Village governments will set up WSUs, which will be responsible \nfor (i) water production and distribution, (ii) application of effective mechanisms for O&M of WSS \ninfrastructure, (iii) billing and collection against the provision of services, and (iv) adherence to \nthe highest standards of accountability through comprehensive and timely financial reporting and \nauditing. There is substantial risk to sustainable operations during the operational phase. To \naddress this risk, an indicative tariff increase from Som77 per household per month in 2018 to \nSom237 per household per month in 2022, when the new WSS facilities are completed and put \nto use, will ensure that WSUs are able to recover operating costs. The indicative incremental tariff \nincrease is about 208%. To ensure an adequate tariff level to cover O&M, operational and \nfinancial performance measures are included in the DLI 8 verification protocol for new WSUs to \n                                                \n26 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n27 Program Procurement System Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Given that lower-value procurement packages are expected to be procured, the high-value procurement thresholds \nare proposed to be lowered. \n ", "12 \nachieve. The RBL program will help sustain progress in financial management, accountability, \nand procurement to monitor financial sustainability of WSUs in the program areas. \n \n36.  Safeguard systems. The RBL program is classified category B for environment. ARIS \nwill screen all program activities. Construction works will be small, and the impacts on the \nenvironment will be site-specific. ADB conducted program safeguards system assessment and \nprepared environmental assessment review framework, and land acquisition and resettlement \nframework to guide the safeguards process for each of the program activities.29 The program is \nclassified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. ARIS \nhas a mechanism for environmental and social safeguards monitoring, which will be strengthened \nto comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) principles. \n  \nC.

Target areas are to be identified by Q1 2020, and will be \nmonitored and measured quarterly. \nd  The infrastructure components comprise the following, sufficient to serve the needs of at least the population of \n64,000: (i) safe water sources (borehole and/or protected spring); (ii) functioning disinfection systems in line with \nnational health norms; (iii) water storage facilities, all of which meet criteria provided in verification protocols; and (iv) \nwater distribution networks at a sufficient depth to avoid freezing, with piped networks extending from the water \nsupply source to the street level, at a minimum. Target areas are to be identified by Q4 2019, and will be monitored \nand measured quarterly. \ne  The functioning of each WSU (fully operational) is gauged from BFMs. Criteria that each WSU must fill are provided \nin the verification protocols. Each WSU should be legally established under the Local Self-Government Law and fully \nresourced  (including  a  general  manager  and/or  accountant,  engineer,  and  technician),  and  its  operational \nperformance measured and monitored. The M&E framework for DLI 8 sets out the data to be collected and monitored, \nincluding (i) financial accounts and records (operating costs and revenue generated); (ii) institutional arrangements, \nincluding its legal mandate; and (iii) staffing levels. Target areas are to be identified by Q4 2019, and will be monitored \nand measured quarterly. \nf  The functioning of the BFM system will be assessed according to the criteria agreed by ARIS and ADB in 2019, \nincluding disaggregation by sex, and the way in which reports and/or complaints are handled for monitoring \nbeneficiary feedback and engagement, covering all aspects of the program implementation period. The BFM will be \nincorporated under the program\u2019s M&E system.
