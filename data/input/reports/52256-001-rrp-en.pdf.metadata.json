The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  the  Naryn  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nDevelopment Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will contribute to a portion of \nthe national Strategy for Development of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems in Settlements \n(SDWSSSS) program, 2016\u20132026 to achieve inclusive and reliable access to safe water supply \nand  sanitation  (WSS)  services. 1  ADB  financing  will  target  infrastructure  expansion  in  rural \ncommunities  of  Naryn  province,  while  building  capacities  of  WSS  service  operators  and \ninstitutions across the country to enhance service delivery and performance of the subsector. \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Central  and West  Asia  and  its \n3. \nestimated gross domestic product per capita is $1,280.2 An estimated 22.4% of the country\u2019s 6.2 \nmillion people live below the national poverty line.3 The concentration of poverty in the country is \nhigher in rural areas and greatest in mountainous areas, where more than half of the population \nis  poor.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  also  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts,  including \nfrequent drought and early snowfall, increasing the risk of water scarcity, frequent landslides, and \nfloods, particularly for poor populations. \n \nAccess to safe drinking WSS in rural areas remains a significant challenge. Poor water \n4. \nquality and sanitation costs the country over $100 million annually, including productivity losses.4 \nMost of the rural WSS infrastructure was built in 1960s and has exceeded its design life, with little \nmaintenance resulting in low-quality services. In 2014, only one-quarter of rural households had \npiped household connections,5 and about 73% of rural households had intermittent water supply. \nThere  are  200  water  supply  intakes  without  sanitary  protection  setback  zones  and  they  lack \ntreatment facilities, exposing people to preventable diseases. Rural sanitation coverage is only \n10% and characterized primarily by unimproved sanitation facilities. The key issues confronting \nrural WSS in the Kyrgyz Republic are (i) insufficient resources because of inadequate tariffs, (ii) \nweak capacity of WSS service operators, and (iii) limited operation and maintenance (O&M) and \ncapital investment. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2016.

In  March  2016,  the \n5. \ngovernment approved its national SDWSSSS program, covering all seven provinces in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The goal of the national program is to increase water supply coverage from 40% to 90% \nand sanitation coverage from 10% to 70% by 2026. The nationwide program is also anchored in \nthe National Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u20132040 which prioritizes access \nto clean drinking water and sanitary facilities.6 The national SDWSSSS program provides a clear \nframework to guide sector development by outlining key areas and activities in developing urban \nand rural water supply and sewerage systems. It also contains measures to conduct analysis and \nmonitoring.  The  resolution  includes  an  implementation  plan  for  ongoing  and  planned  projects \ntotaling  $420  million  with  financing  sourced  from  the  state  budget  (6.4%)  and  primarily  from \nexternal  sources (93.6%).  The  national  program  expenditure  framework  consists  of  an  annual \nbudget  of  $63 million  during  2018\u20132020,  which comprises  development  partner funding  (90%) \nthrough loans and grants. Government counterpart funding is 10% ($6 million per year). \n \n6. \nStrong  commitment  to  delivering  results  in the  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsubsector. The government has demonstrated a high level of commitment from 2016 and has \nbeen proactive in attracting development partners, who have committed $393 million to support \nthe  national  SDWSSSS  program  during  2016\u20132026.  The  national  program  is  benefiting  from \nassistance from bilateral partners, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nEuropean Union, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank. In November 2018, ADB \napproved  the  Issyk-Kul  Wastewater  Management  Project  to  upgrade  and  expand  the  existing \nwastewater systems in Balykchy and Karakol cities. \n  \n7. \nImprovements  in  institutional  arrangements  in  the  subsector.  The  Department  of \nDrinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development (DDWSSD) under the State Agency for Water \nResources, established in 2012, is in charge of the WSS policy, sector reforms, and execution of \nthe  SDWSSSS.  The  DDWSSD  has  been  actively  seeking  improvements  to  institutional \narrangements and has demonstrated a willingness for change in the subsector. The Community \nDevelopment  and  Investment  Agency  (ARIS),  a  government  agency  was  established  in  2003, \nwith  a  mandate  to  support  local  governments  to  deliver  new  and  rehabilitated  assets; 7 \nimplementation  of  investment  plans;  and  provision  of  technical,  administrative,  and  financial \nassistance.  Local governments are the asset owners and community drinking water users\u2019 unions \n(CDWUUs)  are  the  service  providers.  However,  only  one-quarter  of  the  633  CDWUUs  are \noperational, while the rest are unable to continue operations because of the lack of revenue and \ntechnical  specialists.  The  government  is  moving  toward  a  professionally  oriented  model,  and \nformalizing these as water supplies and utilities services entities (WSUs) in accordance with the \nLaw  of  Local  Self-Government  (2018).  This  new  model  will  support  WSUs  to  improve \nsustainability and have access to public funding (e.g., transfers). \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe SDWSSSS aims to improve access to safe rural WSS and is aligned with Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  1,  5,  6,  10,  12,  and  13.  The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  is \nembedded  in  the  SDWSSSS  program  and  will  enhance  development  effectiveness.  The \ngovernment requested support from multiple development partners to implement the SDWSSSS \n                                                \n6   Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018. National Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018\u20132040. \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n7  ARIS was established in October 2003 and is governed by a statutory supervisory board composed of seven national \ngovernment  representatives,  seven  local  government  representatives,  and  seven  nongovernment  organization \nrepresentatives. Currently, ARIS employs 311 staff. \n\nBishkek. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fprogram and allocated each of the seven provinces to different development partners to expedite \nefficiency and enhance coordination. The government requested ADB\u2019s assistance in Naryn. \n \n9. \nNaryn is a mountainous province and one of the poorest in the Kyrgyz Republic, with a \npoverty rate of 29% in 2017. Naryn\u2019s resident population was estimated at 287,000 in 2018 across \nNaryn township and 165 villages (footnote 3). In 2009, the urban population share was 15.3%.8 \nThe ADB-supported Bishkek\u2013Torugart road traverses through Naryn and connects Bishkek to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), providing regional connectivity with Central Asian neighbors \nand opportunities for rural development.9 Most villages in Naryn have unprotected water sources. \nIncidences of waterborne diseases are high in Naryn. The program will cover 64,000 people in \nNaryn  and  will  support  the  design,  construction,  and  rehabilitation  of  WSS  facilities;  and \ninstitutional capacity to provide sustainable and safe WSS services across 31 program villages. \nIn addition, the program will ensure that detailed designs are completed for 12 program villages \nand ready them for implementation when additional financing becomes available. \n \n10. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategic  priorities.  The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030,  supporting  four  of  the  seven  operational  priorities:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing  inequalities,  (ii)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security,  (iii)  strengthening \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (iv)  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience.10 The \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2019\u2013\n2021 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022, \nwhich  calls  for  equality  between  regions,  and  improved  WSS  services.11 The  program  is  also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Water Policy and Water Operational Plan.12 \n \nLessons learned. ADB\u2019s assistance from 2000 to 2013 included two subsector projects \n11. \ntotaling  $66  million. 13 In  2000,  ADB  approved  the  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services \nSector Project (CBISSP), which suffered from major cost overruns and poor execution of works. \nTo rectify deficiencies, in 2009 ADB approved supplementary financing. However, only about 10% \nof  planned  subprojects  were  completed  and,  because  of  procurement  irregularities  and \nnoncompliance with ADB procedures, the project was canceled in 2013.14 From 2013 to 2018, \n\n                                                \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.

The RBL program incorporates these lessons as follows: \n\nStrong government ownership. The government has demonstrated ownership \nof  the  subsector  through  the  establishment  of  the  national  program  and \ncommitment  to  deliver  results.  Several  development  partners  have  active \noperations supporting the national program, which are progressing well. Through \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  intervention,  the  government  has  included  results-based \nfinancing for the sanitation component and introduced verification protocols. The \nRBL  is  established  within  the  broader  national  program  and  will  support  the \nSDWSSSS program until it ends in 2026. \nStrengthened  institutional  arrangements.  The  executing  agency  for  the \nCBISSP was originally the Department of Rural Water Supply under the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Water  Resources,  and  Processing  Industry.  Subsequently,  the \nexecuting  agency  arrangements  changed  four  times  during  the  implementation \nperiod. These changes stifled project performance and led to poor development \neffectiveness.  Similarly,  the  implementing  agency  originally  was  a  joint-project \nmanagement unit within the National Agency for Local Self-Governance that later \nproved  to  be  ineffective.  Overall,  the  subsector  lacked  an  effective  and  stable \ngovernance framework and did not  have  a  central  agency for  policy  leadership. \nADB\u2019s TA supported the government in establishing strong and competent sector \ninstitutions. The RBL program\u2019s executing agency will be the DDWSSD, and the \nprogram implementing agency will be ARIS. The DDWSSD and ARIS have been \nkey  stakeholders  in  the  rural WSS  subsector;  ARIS  has  clear  accountability  for \ndelivering the externally financed projects. The DDWSSD was not part of CBISSP, \nwhereas  ARIS\u2019s  involvement  was  through  2011\u20132012.  The  noncompliance \nsituation emerged before the transition to ARIS, and ARIS was not able to rectify \nrelated  issues,  including  quality  technical  supervision  of  works  that  had  been \nimplemented, within the short 10-month period during which it was the executing \nagency.  Currently,  ARIS  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  10  externally \nfinanced projects including those funded by the World Bank. Essential resources \nhave been provided to strengthen the capacity of ARIS. The program design has \nbenefitted  from  development  coordination  through  the  Development  Partners \nCoordination Council, and directly with development agencies. The RBL program \nuses  harmonized  results  framework  with  the  World  Bank  to  encourage \ncomplementary  activities  to  improve  sector  governance  and  accountability.  The \nprogram  design  allows  for  scaling  up,  if  and  when  additional  financing  or \ncofinancing  becomes  available.  In  particular,  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  has \nexpressed interest in supporting the RBL program. \nCompleted due diligence during program processing. The DDWSSD has been \nthe  lead  policy  and  planning  institution  for  the  subsector  since  2016,  and  is \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Drinking  Water  Law  (1999).  The \nDDWSSD has dedicated staff and provides program governance and coordination \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2013.

The absence of a strong central agency was one of the \nmain reasons for the slow pace of governance, institution, policy, and regulatory \nreforms.  ADB  assessments  have  concluded  that  the  DDWSSD  and  ARIS  have \ndeveloped \nin  project  management,  safeguards, \nprocurement, and financial management that can be used to support the program. \nProgress  reviews  will  provide  indication  of  the  potential  (i)  to  scale  up \nimplementation  efforts  across  other  villages  in  Naryn  and  (ii)  to  broaden  the \napplication of program systems, such as the program procurement manual and the \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, to other provinces. \nStrengthened  capacity  and  program  systems.  The  RBL  program  will  be \ncomplemented by an attached TA and a small expenditure financing facility (SEFF) \nactivity  to  support  institutional  strengthening  of  the  program  systems  and  key \ninstitutions.16 The  additional  resources  will  support  the  recruitment  of  a  credible \nindependent  verification  agent  (IVA)  and  provide  program  start-up  and \nimplementation  services  to  mitigate  the  program\u2019s  operating  environment  risks, \npromote delivery of critical results through the effective use of disbursement-linked \nindicators (DLIs), enhance the sustainability of RBL program benefits, and assess \nopportunities for scaling up the program. \n\n(iv) \n\n \n13. \nResults-based  lending  modality.  The  RBL  instrument  responds  to  the  government\u2019s \nrequest to shift the focus from investment transactions toward the RBL modality to incentivize the \nachievement  of  results,  support  financing  a  slice  of  its  SDWSSSS  expenditure  program,  and \nfurther strengthen the institutional capacity of the DDWSSD and ARIS to promote sustainability \nof  the  program.  ARIS  has  experience  with  the  implementation  of  results-based  financing \nmechanisms, specifically in the rural sanitation subsector (footnote 4). Due diligence assessments \nprovide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  government\u2019s  program  systems  can  deliver  verifiable \nresults. Institutional strengthening actions proposed in procurement, M&E, and fiduciary practices \nwill mitigate related risks and support program implementation efficiency. The RBL is effective in \nmanaging  large  number  of  small  procurement  packages.  It  also  provides  a  good  platform  for \ncapacity  development  and  technical  and  policy  discussions,  particularly  in  areas  to  (i)  achieve \nprogram results and DLI targets, (ii) enhance program systems on the basis of the outcome of \ntechnical, fiduciary, and program safeguard-system assessments, (iii) strengthen accountability \nof  basic  service  provision  to  rural  residents,  and  (iv)  leverage  cofinancing.  The  government \nconfirmed its strong commitment to this instrument. \n \n14. \nADB value addition. ADB value addition includes (i) the introduction of a results-based \napproach  for  investment  planning  and  strengthening  of  institutions;  (ii)  a  focus  on  building  the \ncapacity and management practices  of asset owners and WSUs; (iii) actions to strengthen the \nprogram  M&E  (para.  31),  procurement,  and  financial  management  systems;  and  (iv)  the \nincorporation of climate change risk management into subsector operations. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nthe proposed ADB financing is $27.4 million (Table 1). \n \n \n \n\nThe government and ADB have agreed on an RBL program size of $32.9 million, of which \n\nProgram Scope \n\n                                                \n16  ADB. 2019.

The  program  will  track  progress \nusing eight DLIs (Table 2) and two indicators not linked to disbursement.18 DLI 1 measures the \npopulation using  water  supply  that meets  national  quality  standards.  DLI  2  monitors  access to \ngender-sensitive safe water and sanitation facilities in selected schools, kindergartens, and health \nfacilities. The program will track progress against output 1 using the completion of detailed design \n(DLI 3) and water supply infrastructure from source, storage, and disinfection to piped networks \n(DLI  4);  and  the  piloting  of  household  sanitation  (DLI  5).  Under  output  2,  DLI  6  includes  the \ndevelopment of a procurement manual, which is instrumental for institutional strengthening and \nimproving procurement practices; DLI 7 will track improved financial management capacity; and \nDLI  8  will  track  the  establishment  and  performance  of WSUs.

The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  submit  to  ADB \nwithdrawal applications, and report DLI achievements according to the verification protocol. ADB \ndisbursement will be made following verification of DLI achievements. Before submission of the \nfirst  withdrawal  application,  the  MOF  will  submit  to  ADB  the  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the \nperson(s) who are authorized to sign the withdrawal applications, together with the authenticated \nsignatures of each authorized person. From program effectiveness, the government will require \n$6.8 million (25%) of the total ADB financing amount to support program budgeting, procurement, \nand contract management. In this regard, advance financing will provide the liquidity needed to \nexpedite  the  program\u2019s  financing  needs  for  investment  activities  through  the  initial  3  years.20 \nFinancing of prior results achieved not more than 12 months before loan and grant signing will be \nallowed to support start-up actions. The endorsement of the procurement manual is identified for \nfinancing for prior result and $820,000 is allocated for achieving this milestone. The concessional \nordinary capital resources loan and Asian Development Fund grant proceeds will be disbursed to \nan account set up in a commercial bank by the MOF, from which ARIS will draw funds for the RBL \nprogram.

The program completion date is on 31 December 2027. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nProgram  design.  The  program  design  is  sound  and  the  DLIs  are  critical  indicators  for \nachieving  overall  program  results.  The  program  design  considers  local  conditions  (such  as \nweather), the need for gender-specific school and health facilities, community-based sanitation \nsolutions, and the need to have efficient and accountable rural WSS services. The program is \ndesigned to improve WSS reliability and sustainability. The program design places emphasis on \nensuring  access  to  all,  which  is  in  line  with  the  SDWSSSS,  and  is  consistent  with  one  of  the \nnational  development  strategy  objectives.  International  expertise  will  be  engaged  to  support \nARIS\u2019s design review, construction supervision, and contract management. A technical auditor \nwill conduct regular audits to ensure that the as-built systems comply with specifications and that \nhigh-quality standards are maintained. Training will be provided to WSU staff to further enable \nsustainable service delivery, with a particular focus on building capacity to identify critical water \nquality risks. \n \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  improving  health  outcomes  and \n28. \nreducing the time spent on water collection. It will directly benefit about 36,500 poor beneficiaries \nby  providing  better  access  to  WSS  services.  It  will  especially  alleviate  women\u2019s  poverty  by \nreducing  the  time  spent  collecting  and  storing  water,  and  making  it  safe  for  household \nconsumption.  Based  on  analyses  of  similar  rural  water  schemes,  the  benefits  are  (i)  reduced \nincidence of water-related diseases and (ii) decreased time spent collecting water and treating it \nin-house.24 \n \nThe  WSS  service  operators  currently  charge  low  tariffs  that  do  not  cover  O&M  costs. \n29. \nPoverty surveys indicate that households are willing to pay much higher tariffs for clean water, \nwhich  would  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  but  not  full  replacement  costs.25 The  national \nprogram underscores the government\u2019s policy objective to create economically sustainable and \naffordable  WSS  services  by  establishing  a  market  format  with  a  reliable  subsidy  system  for \nvulnerable  groups.  As  the  RBL  program  rehabilitates  and  commissions  new  schemes,  local \ngovernments will establish WSUs to provide services and ensure proper O&M. The attached TA \nand  SEFF  activity  will  promote  sustainable  approaches  and  accountable  arrangements  and, \nthrough a public awareness campaign, service levels will encourage higher collection efficiency \nrates by the WSUs. Institutions and systems will be further strengthened, especially at the local \nlevel,  to  provide  sufficient  budget  allocation  for  routine  O&M,  if  needed.  The  attached  TA  and \nSEFF  will  be  provided  to  implement  efficient  operations,  including  developing  appropriate \nstrategies for billing and collection of tariffs. \n \n\n                                                \n24  Program Soundness Assessment; and Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n25 ADB. 2019. Poverty, Social, and Gender Assessment. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 9633-KGZ). \n\n\fProgram Systems Assessments \n\nThe  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Given  existing  gender \n30. \ninequalities  and  women\u2019s  role  in  water  collection,  housework,  and  childcare,  the  program  will \nalleviate women\u2019s workload, free up time for productive activities and leisure, and meet water and \nhygiene needs for businesses headed by women. Gender is mainstreamed through DLI 2 and \nDLI 8 to promote (i) gender-sensitive infrastructure design (Appendix 3, Table A3.1), (ii) women\u2019s \nrepresentation  in  management  structures,  and  (iii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  service-related \nconsultations.  The  PAP  requires  BFM  and  WSU  trainings  to  promote  gender  awareness  and \naction. \n \nB. \n \n31.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  ARIS  has  a  comprehensive  M&E  system  for \nexternally  funded  projects,  including  baseline  surveys  and  infrastructure monitoring.  ARIS  has \nnine  M&E  specialists  and  a  network  of  BFM  specialists  to  report  progress.  ARIS  has  proven \nmonitoring capacity for reporting on project and program indicators.26 ARIS is also developing a \nrural WSS information system to support its M&E system. \n \n32. \nFiduciary systems. The financial management assessment of ARIS concluded that the \noverall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial,  based  on  specific  financial \nmanagement weaknesses identified in planning and budgeting, staffing, accounting and internal \ncontrol, and external audit. The implementation of a proposed financial management action plan \nwill reduce such risk. \n \n33. \nThe  overall  program  procurement  risk  is  assessed  moderate.  The  Public  Procurement \nLaw  (2015)  was found  to be  generally  comprehensive and included  open  competitive bidding. \nThe  program  will  rely  on  the  RBL  program  procurement  system. 27  ARIS  will  develop  a \nprocurement manual to ensure that procurement procedures and processes under the program \nmitigate procurement risks and meet ADB principles.28 \n \n34. \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government, \nthe  DDWSSD  and  ARIS.  The  government\u2019s  anticorruption  laws  are  comprehensive,  and  the \ninstitutional framework is assessed adequate. \n \n35. \nThe  sustainability  of  the  program  is  linked  to  the  adequate  operations  of  newly  built \nsystems,  particularly  the  maintenance  of  equipment  and  disinfection  systems,  which  will  be \ninstalled at all production sites. Village governments will set up WSUs, which will be responsible \nfor (i) water production and distribution, (ii) application of effective mechanisms for O&M of WSS \ninfrastructure, (iii) billing and collection against the provision of services, and (iv) adherence to \nthe highest standards of accountability through comprehensive and timely financial reporting and \nauditing.  There  is  substantial  risk  to  sustainable  operations  during  the  operational  phase.  To \naddress this risk, an indicative tariff increase from Som77 per household per month in 2018 to \nSom237 per household per month in 2022, when the new WSS facilities are completed and put \nto use, will ensure that WSUs are able to recover operating costs. The indicative incremental tariff \nincrease  is  about  208%.  To  ensure  an  adequate  tariff  level  to  cover  O&M,  operational  and \nfinancial performance measures are included in the DLI 8 verification protocol for new WSUs to \n                                                \n26 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n27 Program Procurement System Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Given that lower-value procurement packages are expected to be procured, the high-value procurement thresholds \n\n2). \n\nare proposed to be lowered. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fachieve.  The  RBL program  will  help sustain progress in financial  management,  accountability, \nand procurement to monitor financial sustainability of WSUs in the program areas. \n \n36. \nSafeguard  systems. The  RBL program  is  classified  category  B for  environment.  ARIS \nwill  screen  all  program  activities.  Construction  works  will  be  small,  and  the  impacts  on  the \nenvironment will be site-specific. ADB conducted program safeguards system assessment and \nprepared  environmental  assessment  review  framework,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework to guide the safeguards process for each of the program activities.29 The program is \nclassified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. ARIS \nhas a mechanism for environmental and social safeguards monitoring, which will be strengthened \nto comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) principles. \n  \nC. \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nResults \nUnfamiliarity with RBL and/or political \npressure to expand interventions could \njeopardize DLI achievement. \nIneffective management of water and \nsanitation facilities with low tariffs and \npoor collection rates leads to poor \nsystems. \n\nFiduciary \nRules for cash management, payment \nprocedures, and contract management \n(internal audit review) are not being fully \nimplemented. \nInternal audit function lacks formal \nprofessional qualifications and has limited \nmethodological and functional capacity, \nwhich resulted in inadequate reporting to \nthe ARIS supervisory board. \nThe Chamber of Accounts\u2019 external audit \nwork is not based on international audit \nstandards and it does not provide an \naudit opinion on any financial statements. \nBFM not fully operational and is \nsignificantly under-resourced. \n\nCorruption \nLevel of corruption in the country is \nrelatively high. \n\nRatings \n\nKey Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\n \nSubstantial  Strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems and \ncapacities to enable frequent DLI monitoring by key \ndecision makers. \n\nSubstantial  Support the replacement of community drinking water \n\nusers\u2019 unions by WSUs, with ownership by local \nauthorities.

Target  areas  are  to  be  identified by  Q1  2020,  and  will  be \nmonitored and measured quarterly. \n\nd  The  infrastructure  components  comprise  the  following,  sufficient  to  serve  the  needs  of  at  least  the  population  of \n64,000: (i) safe water sources (borehole and/or protected spring); (ii) functioning disinfection systems in line with \nnational health norms; (iii) water storage facilities, all of which meet criteria provided in verification protocols; and (iv) \nwater  distribution  networks  at  a  sufficient  depth  to  avoid  freezing,  with  piped  networks  extending  from  the  water \nsupply source to the street level, at a minimum. Target areas are to be identified by Q4 2019, and will be monitored \nand measured quarterly. \n\ne  The functioning of each WSU (fully operational) is gauged from BFMs. Criteria that each WSU must fill are provided \nin the verification protocols. Each WSU should be legally established under the Local Self-Government Law and fully \nresourced  (including  a  general  manager  and/or  accountant,  engineer,  and  technician),  and  its  operational \nperformance measured and monitored. The M&E framework for DLI 8 sets out the data to be collected and monitored, \nincluding (i) financial accounts and records (operating costs and revenue generated); (ii) institutional arrangements, \nincluding its legal mandate; and (iii) staffing levels. Target areas are to be identified by Q4 2019, and will be monitored \nand measured quarterly. \n\nf  The functioning of the BFM system will be assessed according to the criteria agreed by ARIS and ADB in 2019, \nincluding  disaggregation  by  sex,  and  the  way  in  which  reports  and/or  complaints  are  handled  for  monitoring \nbeneficiary feedback and engagement, covering all aspects of the program implementation period. The BFM will be \nincorporated under the program\u2019s M&E system.

Institutional capacities strengthened for enhanced sustainability in the rural water supply services and sanitation subsector \n\nDLI 6: Procurement manual is developed and implemented for the RBL program from 2020 \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDisbursement-Linked \nIndicator \n\n2019 Baseline: ARIS\u2019s \nprocurement and contract \nmanagement systems \nassessed, and gaps \nidentified \n\nPrior results: A \nProcurement Manual and \nan MYP on procurement \ntraining, rules and \nprocedures appropriate for \nARIS, developed and \ncompleted in line with \ninternational best \npractices, including FIDIC  \n\n2020-2026: \n\nFor each year, MYP \ntargets of the respective \nyear implemented \naccording to the \nProcurement Manual \n\n \n\nDefinition and Description of Achievement \n\nmeans that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be \nreleased when the set target is fully achieved, even if the achievement is \nlate, as long as the achievement is during the program\u2019s duration. Early \ndisbursement is also allowed when achievement is earlier than scheduled. \n\nDefinition. The Procurement Manual, developed in 2019 and approved by \nthe program coordination committee (comprised of DDWSSD (chair), ARIS, \nMOF, MOE, MOH, State Agency for Local Self-Governance, Naryn \nplenipotentiary governor), will set out the procurement processes for the \nprogram in line with international best practices, including FIDIC, and \nagreed to by ADB. The Multi-Year Procurement Action Plan (MYP) means \nan action plan (including training) also developed in 2019 with technical \nsupport provided by ADB from separate technical assistance funds. The \nMYP is considered completed when ADB and ARIS both sign off on it.  \n\nConditions for disbursement are met if the targets in the first column are \nachieved.  \n\nPartial disbursement. The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is \nallowed according to the number of MYP action points achieved each year. \nThe total number of MYP action points for a given year (e.g., 8 action \npoints) will represent the 100% disbursement target for that year. If 4 of \nthose action points are achieved for that year, then 50% of the \ndisbursement allocation is made. If the target is not fully achieved, then \ndisbursement can be proportional to the increase made from the previous \nyear\u2019s targeted achievement. The following formula will be applied: \n\nPartial DLI disbursement = planned DLI disbursement for the period \uf04f \n(actual achievement of the current period\u2013targeted achievement of the \nprevious period)/ (targeted achievement of the current period\u2013targeted \nachievement of the previous period). \n\nDisbursements are not allowed for procurement actions that do not follow \nthe rules and procedures in the Procurement Manual. Other than this, \ndisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the MYP targets, \nsuch as for training. This means that the planned disbursement amount for \na given year can be released when the set target is fully achieved, even if \nthe achievement is late, as long as the achievement is during the program\u2019s \nduration. Early disbursement is also allowed when achievement is earlier \nthan scheduled. \n\nDLI 7: By 2026, 100% of internal audit staff and finance staff of ARIS trained and certified in internal audit and financial management, respectively, by a nationally \nrecognized institute \n\n\fDisbursement-Linked \nIndicator \n\n2019 Baseline: ARIS\u2019s \nfinancial management \nsystem assessed and \nareas for improvement \nidentified, including \ntraining needs \n\n2020, 2022, 2024, 2026: \nFor each of these years, \nARIS ensures that at least \nfour internal audit staff and \nfinance staff are trained \nrespectively in audit and \nfinancial management \n\nDefinition and Description of Achievement \n\nDefinitions. ARIS staff trained for a given year means that (a) a training \nneeds assessment is carried out before the training in the year specified; (b) \nthe training plan is developed for that year; (c) a training program is \nprepared; (d) the list of participation is verified by the training provider for \nthat year; and (e) training is conducted by a nationally recognized institute.  \n\nConditions for disbursement are met if the targets in the first column are \nachieved, with the criteria specified in (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) above.  \n\nPartial disbursement. The DLI is not scalable and partial disbursement is \nnot allowed for the specified year. \n\nDisbursements are not allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This \nmeans that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can only be \nreleased when the set target is fully achieved within that year.  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nInformation Source \nand Frequency \n\nVerification Agency, Procedure and \nTime Frame \n\nARIS database on \nthe program.  \n\nRequired frequency \nfor reporting will be \nonce every two \nyears (biennial), and \nARIS and ADB may \nagree each year on \ninterim reporting \narrangements as \nappropriate.  \n\nMonitoring may be \nas frequent as ARIS \nwishes. \n\nEach year, the focal unit(s) in ARIS \nprepares an attestation that the DLI is \nmet and attaches the relevant report. \n\nThe IVA will verify the results through \ntraining records available from ARIS and \ninterviews as appropriate of trained staff. \n\nThe IVA will refer to the verification \nprotocols and other relevant guidelines \nprepared for the program.

A water supplies and utilities services entity (WSU) is \nestablished by the aiyl okmotu within the aiyl okmotu (village administration) \nitself. The aiyl okmotu will own the water system assets while the WSU is \nresponsible for delivering water, maintaining the assets and collecting \ntariffs, being responsible to and reporting to the aiyl okmotu. To this end, an \noperational WSU should be legally established under the Local Self-\nGovernment Law, fully resourced (including a General Manager or \nAccountant, Engineer, and 1 Technician), and operational performance \nmeasured and monitored (i.e., total operating revenue over total operating \nexpense is not less than 0.5 in 2022, 0.6 in 2023, 0.7 in 2024, 0.8 in 2025, \n0.9 in 2026, and 1.0 in 2027).b The M&E framework for DLI 8 sets out the \ndata to be collected and monitored include (i) financial account and records \n(operating costs and revenue generate); (ii) institutional arrangements \nincluding its legal creation; and (iii) staffing levels. The water enterprise may \ncover more than one village or system, depending on the scoping study to \nbe conducted in the first year. While the specific terms of reference for \nWSUs are defined by each aiyl okmotu, these generally include the \nfollowing: (a) quality assurance of water supply, (b) maintenance of \nnetworks and equipment necessary for water supply and sanitation, (c) \nconstruction and installation works, (d) provision of paid services, and (e) \n\u201ccommercial activities\u201d (i.e., tariff collection).  \nBefore each WSU is set up, public consultations and training of relevant \nstaff must be conducted in the village(s) concerned. For 2021 (i), 2022 (i), \n2023 (i), and 2024 (i), the combined records of the public consultations and \n\nARIS database on \nthe program.  \n\nRequired frequency \nfor reporting will be \nannual, and ARIS \nand ADB may agree \neach year on interim \nreporting \narrangements as \nappropriate.  \n\nMonitoring may be \nas frequent as ARIS \nwishes. \n\nUse audited \nfinancial statements \n(audited by \nindependent auditor \nsuch as, Chamber of \nAccount or private \naudit firm) to \nmeasure operating \nratio. \n\nEach year, the focal unit(s) in ARIS \nprepares an attestation that the DLI is \nmet and attaches the relevant report. \n\nThe IVA will verify the results each year \nthrough field visits to target villages as \nwell as records available from ARIS \n(such as BFM), aiyl okmotu, and local \nauthorities at national, raion and \ncommunity level, as required. Spot \nchecks and interviews will be \nimplemented on field trips as \nappropriate. \n\nThe IVA will refer to the verification \nprotocols and other relevant guidelines \nprepared for the program.

The WSU should be established no later \nthan a year after the water supply networks are constructed, completed, and \nhanded over/commissioned (DLI 1).  \n\nTariff means the price assigned to water supplied by the aiyl okmotu (owner \nof the facility) through a piped network to users. The water tariffs are \ndeveloped by aiyl okmotu and approved by the aiyl kenesh (local council).  \n\n\u201cPopulation served by WSUs\u201d means that this population is living in villages \nthat have functioning WSUs as part of the aiyl okmotu. The functioning of \nthe WSUs is gauged from the BFM system that ARIS will implement as part \nof the RBL program (see non-disbursement linked indicator on BFM).  \n\n20% female participation in the WSU means that by 2025 and 2026, the \nproportion of women members in the total WSUs established by the RBL \nprogram is not less than 20%.  \n\nConditions for disbursement are met if the targets in the first column are \nachieved.  \n\nPartial disbursement. The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is \nallowed for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, according to (i) target population to be \nserviced by WSUs (i.e., whether the established WSUs for that year are \nsufficient for the target population number); (ii) population covered by \napproved tariffs. For year 2021, equal weight is assigned to targets (i), (ii) \nand (iii) in that year\u2019s disbursement allocation. For years 2022, 2023, and \n2024, equal weight is assigned to targets (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) in each year\u2019s \ndisbursement allocation. For years 2025 and 2026, equal weight is assigned \nto targets (i) and (ii), and partial disbursement is also allowed according to \n(i) population served by established WSUs; and (ii) the percentage of \nfemales in the overall WSUs.  \n\nFemale participation: The 40% female participation in consultations and \ntrainings is not scalable, meaning that consultations and training activities \nmust have a combined total 40% female participation for that year or they \nwill not be counted for that year.    \n\nThe 20% female participation in WSUs is scalable and partial \ndisbursements may be made in 2025 and 2026, according to the proportion \nof women in the overall total of WSUs (not necessarily for each WSU). \n\nIf the target is not fully achieved, then disbursement can be proportional to \nthe increase made from the previous year\u2019s targeted achievement.
