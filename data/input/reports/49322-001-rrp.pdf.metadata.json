Agriculture  has  developed  rapidly  and  has \nmade substantial contributions to the overall economic development of the PRC. However, the \ntransition  to  modern  agriculture  has  not  kept  pace  with  urbanization  and  industrialization.  The \nper capita income of urban households was 2.75 times that of rural households in 2014. Given \nits fundamental contribution to food security and the improvement of rural livelihood, agricultural \nmodernization continues to be highly prioritized by the Government of the PRC, particularly by \nencouraging stronger participation of private sector companies.1 \n \n3. \nInsufficient  domestic  milk  production.  The  gap  between  domestic  production  and \nconsumption of processed milk is forecast to grow from 9.7 million tons in 2014 to 15.4 million \ntons  in  2024.  However,  the  PRC  cannot  rely  on  imported  milk  powder  to  meet  the  increasing \ndemand, not only because of impacts on national food security, but also because fresh milk has \na higher nutritional value than milk reconstituted from milk powder. As a result, investing in the \ndairy farming sector is needed to increase the production of high-quality raw milk. \n \n4. \nFood  safety  issues.  The  PRC\u2019s  milk  industry  has  faced  serious  food  safety  issues, \nmost  notably  the  melamine  incident  in  2008.2 Since  then,  the  central  government  has  made \nsignificant strides in food safety management. The Food Safety Law (2009, amended in 2015) \nstipulates  that  (i)  local  governments  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  supervision  and \nmanagement  of  food  safety  in  their  jurisdiction;  and  (ii)  food  producers  and  traders  are \nresponsible for strict compliance with the law, relevant regulations, and food safety standards.3 \n \nEnvironmental  issues.  If  not  properly  managed,  the  development  of  the  dairy  sector \n5. \ncould harm the environment. Dairy farms produce waste with a high concentration of pollutants; \nthe waste is often discharged without proper treatment, seriously polluting land and water, and \ncausing  significant  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  government  has  promoted  policies  that \nmandate  waste  treatment  but  most  farms  still  do  not  have  proper  waste  treatment  facilities \n(footnote 3). \n \n6. \nLarge-scale  dairy  farm  development.  To  meet  the  growing  demand  for  quality  milk \nproduced  locally,  the  PRC  government  continues  to  support  the  construction  of  large-scale, \n\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic \n\nof China and Asian Development Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n\n2  S. McDonald. 2008. Nearly 53,000 Chinese children sick from milk. Associated Press. 22 September. \n3  ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Henan  Sustainable  Livestock  Farming  and  Product  Safety  Demonstration \nProject. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fmodern,  and  standardized  dairy  farms.4 Large  dairy  farms  with  more  than  100  cows  have  a \ncompetitive advantage over small dairy farms. They are more cost-efficient thanks to economies \nof  scale. They  are  also more  able  to  invest  in quality  inputs  and management  systems.  Large \ndairy  processors,  such  as  the  Inner  Mongolia  Yili  Industrial  Group  and  the  Inner  Mongolia \nMengniu  Dairy  Group,  tend  to  source  raw  milk  from  modern,  large-scale  farms  that  can  meet \ntheir quality standards and also mitigate the risk of food safety incidents. However, large-scale \ndairy farming needs to be more environmentally sustainable. \n \nBorrower\u2019s  selection.  SKX  is  the  fourth-largest  dairy  farming  company  in  the  PRC  in \n7. \nterms  of  herd  size,  with  90,000  cows  as  of  December  2015.5 After  appraising  the  industry\u2019s \nlargest companies, the project team identified SKX as the most suitable for Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  support  because  of  its  (i)  strategic  focus  on  dairy  farming  (no  dairy  processing \noperations)  and  continuous  efforts  to  improve  dairy  farm  management  practices;  (ii)  research \nand development operations and scientific approach to dairy cow breeding  based on the most \nadvanced  frozen  semen  technologies;  and  (iii)  highly  experienced  and  well-respected \nmanagement  team  led  by  Yang  Wenjun,  who  was  the  chief  executive  officer  of  Mengniu  (the \nsecond-largest  dairy  processing  company  in  the  PRC,  after  Yili)  during  2006\u20132012.  SKX  is \ncommitted  to  adopting  international  best  practices  in  terms  of  environmental  and  food  safety \nmanagement, and to setting a benchmark for the industry. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n8. \nThe project will support SKX\u2019s $160 million investment plan during 2017\u20132018, including \ncapital expenditure (capex) on the environment, food safety, and modern dairy farm expansion. \n \n9. \nEnvironmental  capital  expenditure.  The  project  aims  to  manage  the  environmental \nissues associated with animal waste by supporting SKX\u2019s best-in-class environmental capex in \nits 27 farms (as of December 2015) and its new farms (four farms to be developed during 2017\u2013\n2018). The project will include the construction of (i) solid\u2013liquid separation facilities, (ii) best-in-\nclass manure storage to prevent contamination of surface and groundwater, (iii) organic fertilizer \nprocessing facilities, (iv) biogas digesters, (v) multilevel oxidation lagoons, and (vi) wastewater \ntreatment  facilities.  After  undergoing  solid\u2013liquid  separation,  solid  waste  is  used  as  cow  bed \npadding and for organic fertilizer production. Some recycled liquid waste is used for washing the \nfloors of cow houses and milking parlors. In at least five farms, SKX will install biogas digesters \nto capture the methane contained in the slurry for use in heating and cooking, or for generating \nelectricity.  In  all  farms,  the  liquid  waste  will  eventually  end  up  in  multilevel  oxidation  lagoons, \nwhere  sediments  are  dredged  out  regularly  and  used  for  organic  fertilizer  production.  The \nwastewater  from  the  lagoons  undergoes  further  treatment  before  being  recycled  for  irrigation. \nSKX  still  needs  to  dilute  wastewater  with  freshwater  to  meet  national  standards  for  irrigation \nwater, but this will no longer be required once the wastewater treatment facilities are upgraded. \nThe  proposed  capex  will  help  SKX  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) \nrequirements  and  with  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  Environmental,  Health,  and \nSafety Guidelines for Mammalian Livestock Production.6 \n \n\n                                                \n4   Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  and  Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.  Resolutions  on \n\nAccelerating Agricultural Modernization by Enhancing Revolution and Innovation. Beijing. \n\n5   As of 2015, China Modern Dairy had 225,000 cows,  Liaoning Huishan Dairy Group had 180,000 cows, and Inner \n\nMongolia Shengmu High-Tech Animal Husbandry had 106,000 cows. \n\n6  International  Finance  Corporation.  2007.  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines  for  Mammalian  Livestock \n\nProduction. Washington, DC. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nCapital  expenditure  on  food  safety.  The  project  will  support  SKX\u2019s  efforts  to  comply \n10. \nwith  national  and  international  food  safety  and  quality  standards.  The  project  will  include \ninvestments  in  (i)  healthy  feed-processing  equipment,  (ii)  animal  health  equipment,  and \n(iii) sterilized  milking  equipment.  High-quality  feed  is  a  key  element  contributing  to  milk  safety. \nFeeding dairy cows with high-quality feed improves their health, reduces the risk of disease and \nusage  of  medicine  (especially  antibiotics),  and  increases  the  quality  of  the  milk  produced. \nInvesting  in  sterilized  milking equipment  is  also  critical,  since  the milking process  is  where the \nrisk of bacterial contamination is the highest. The project will ensure that existing and new farms \nachieve  best-in-class  certifications,  including  the  national  good  agricultural  practices  and  the \ninternationally recognized hazard analysis and critical control point certification. \n \n11. \nCapital expenditure on modern dairy farm expansion. SKX plans to develop at least \nfour new modern dairy farms with about 5,000 cows each during 2017\u20132018. The new farms will \nbe in the rural areas of the northern provinces and autonomous regions of Hebei, Heilongjiang, \nHenan, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, and Shanxi, where the supply of forage crops such as corn \nsilage  and  alfalfa  is  good.  Young  cows  for  the  new  farms  will  most  likely  be  transferred  from \nexisting farms. Since cows are not milkable until they reach the age of 24 months, the cost of \nfeeding young cows is included in the dairy farm expansion capex. The project will also include \ninvestments in barns, milking parlors, other buildings, and infrastructure. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\n12. \nSKX  has  21  farms  in Inner  Mongolia,  three  in  Hebei,  and  one  each  in  Henan,  Ningxia \nHu,  and  Shandong.  Founded  by  Mengniu  in  2006  as  a  dairy  cow  breeding  company,  SKX\u2019s \nmain business was in frozen semen. In 2012, Yang Wenjun led a management buyout and took \ncontrol of the company. SKX has since expanded into the dairy farm business. Through organic \ngrowth  and  acquisitions  of  smaller  dairy  companies  and  individual  farms,  SKX  has  grown  to \nbecome the fourth-largest dairy company in the PRC. As of 2015, SKX recorded total revenue \nof $167 million; earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of $59 million; and \nnet profit of $25 million. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n13. \nThe  project  will  promote  modern  dairy  farming  with  better  environmental  sustainability \nand  product  safety.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  2015  strategic  orientations  for  the \nagriculture sector provided by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the \nPRC  government  as  a  contribution  to  the  country\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2016\u20132020), \nwhich set policy objectives for the sector, including (i) enhancing environmental protection and \nwaste treatment in agricultural production; (ii) improving the quality of agricultural products and \nthe  level  of  food  safety;  and  (iii)  optimizing  the  \u201cstructure\u201d  of  the  agricultural  industry  by \nsupporting production in certain sectors, such as the livestock sector (footnote 4). \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n14. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  the  demonstration  of  modern  dairy  farming  with \nstronger  environmental  sustainability  and  milk  safety.  Detailed  indicators  on  waste  treatment \nand milk safety are listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. The project will \ncontribute to climate change mitigation by capturing methane in biogas digesters (66,000 tons of \ncarbon  dioxide  avoided  every  year  from  2020),  but  also  more  generally  through  improved \n\n \n\n\fanimal productivity and better feed management arising from modern dairy farming investments \nand  practices.  The  project  will  also  support  job  creation  and  job  preservation  in  rural  areas. \nSKX\u2019s  farms  are  located  in  the  rural  areas  of  some  of  the  PRC\u2019s  poorest  provinces,  such  as \nShanxi  (24th  out  of  31  provinces  and autonomous  regions  in terms  of  gross domestic  product \nper  capita),  Henan  (22nd),  Heilongjiang  (20th)  Hebei  (18th),  and  Ningxia  Hu  (15th).  SKX\u2019s \nworkforce is expected to increase from 2,000 in 2015 (of whom 31% are women) to more than \n2,600 in 2020 (of whom 35% are women). As of 2015, SKX\u2019s employees were 21% Mongolian, \n6% Hui, 1% Man, and 3% other minorities. The number of smallholder farmers supplying forage \nto SKX is also expected to increase from about 15,000 in 2015 to at least 17,500 by 2020. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs of the project will be the successful implementation of (i) an environmental \n15.  \ncapex plan, (ii) a food safety capex plan, and (iii) a modern dairy farm expansion plan. Detailed \nindicators are listed in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy  2020, which emphasizes \n16. \nthe  need to support food security  and agricultural  productivity  and to promote  food safety  and \nquality standards.7 The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020 for the PRC. To support rural development for inclusive economic growth, ADB will assist \nthe  PRC  in  developing  suitable  methods  to  (i)  modernize  agriculture;  (ii)  promote  circular \nagriculture  through  the  value  chain  to  reduce  resource  inputs  and  waste  outputs,  and  control \npollution; and (iii) improve food safety, including related infrastructure and capacity development. \nThrough  its  private  sector  operations,  ADB  will  support  agribusiness  projects  that  enhance \nproductivity, inclusion of smallholder farmers in value chains, and food safety (footnote1). \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n17. \nThe project is also fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural \nResources,  which  recommends  greater  private  sector  agribusiness  investments  by  ADB  to \n\u201ccontribute  to  public  goods,  such  as  food  security,  food  safety,  and  reduced  soil  and  water \npollution,  thus  benefiting  the  wider  [developing  member  country]  populations.\u201d 8  The  project \nbuilds on lessons learned from ADB\u2019s long history  in the PRC livestock sector, particularly the \nneed  to  achieve  development  impact  through  private  sector  agro-enterprises  with  sufficient \nscale.9 It will complement a PRC sovereign project approved in 2015, which will support similar \nenvironmental and food safety investments by medium-sized livestock companies (footnote 3), \nwhile ADB\u2019s proposed nonsovereign assistance targets a larger company, SKX. \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

In particular, SKX is subject to the Environmental Protection \nLaw (2015), the Environmental Impact Assessment Law (2003), and the Food Safety Law (2009, \namended in 2015). \nSKX is led by a management team with a long experience in the dairy breeding, farming, and \nprocessing industry. Yang Wenjun, SKX\u2019s chairman, is the former CEO of Mengniu. Under his \nleadership (2006\u20132012), Mengniu became the PRC\u2019s second-largest dairy processing company. \nHis management skills and rich experience are key factors in driving SKX\u2019s success.  \nSKX plans to develop and build at least four new farms during 2017\u20132018. Each new farm will be \ndesigned to accommodate up to 5,000 heads. It will take about 12 months to complete a farm. \nThe new farms will be located in areas where the supply of forage crops and water is good. \nYoung cows will most likely be transferred from existing herds. Procurement of equipment and \ncivil works will be carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) as they apply to private sector projects. ADB\u2019s technical consultant has reviewed \nand validated the cost of the new farms and found them to be in line with market standards. \nRaw milk is sold under long-term contracts with large dairy processors, similar to the contracts in \nplace for existing farms. SKX will manage its dairy farm operations according to the best industry \nstandards, including ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements, and will adopt GAP \nand HACCP food safety certifications. \nSKX will report on key performance indicators, including financial, safeguard, gender, and \ndevelopment indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets), on at least an annual basis. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEO = chief executive officer, GAP = good agricultural practices, HACCP = hazard \nanalysis and critical control point, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SKX = Inner Mongolia Saikexing Breeding and \nBiotechnology Group. \nSources: Inner Mongolia Saikexing Breeding and Biotechnology Group; and Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nUnique Features \n\n21. \nThe  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  direct  nonsovereign  assistance  to  a  livestock  company  and \nADB\u2019s first private sector agribusiness project with a specific focus on environmental protection \nand food safety, which are among the PRC\u2019s top priorities for the sector. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n22. \nADB  proposes  to  provide  a  loan  facility  of  up  to  $125  million  equivalent  to  SKX, \nconsisting  of  an  A-loan  of  up  to  $62.5  million  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  and  a \ncomplementary loan of up to $62.5 million equivalent in US dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the \nA-loan  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources,  and  the  complementary  loan  will  be  funded  by  the \nPRC banks or international commercial banks with local branches in the PRC, with ADB acting \nas the lender of record. SKX will use the loan proceeds to finance those of its subsidiaries that \nwill be implementing different components of the project. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \n\nADB assistance will add value on several fronts: \n(i) \n\nDemonstration  effect.  ADB  will  help  SKX  set  environmental  and  food  safety \nbenchmarks for the PRC\u2019s dairy farming industry. This will encourage other large \nand medium-scale dairy farming companies to follow this model. \nLong-term  financing.  Environmental  and  food  safety  capex  have  a  payback \nperiod that is hard to quantify, since they do not directly contribute to increased \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nrevenue  but  rather  help  mitigate  risks  and  contribute  to  positive.  Long-term \nfinancing is required to encourage private sector to make these investments. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Multiple projects at once. Through a single corporate loan, ADB can finance up \nto 31 farms in seven provinces and autonomous regions, ensuring a wide impact. \nCofinancing mobilization. Domestic and international commercial banks will be \nencouraged to provide long-term financing to SKX through complementary loans. \nlearned  for  future  projects.  Governments  and  private  sector \nLessons \ncompanies from other developing member countries can learn from this project to \npromote sustainable dairy farming and milk safety in their country. \n\n(v) \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n24. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nSince  the  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  a  corporate  loan  that  is  not  earmarked  for  financing \nspecific subprojects but will finance certain types of capex across all existing and new farms, the \nrequirements for general corporate finance projects will apply. The potential environmental and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified,  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize, \nmitigate,  and  compensate  for  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and \nplans. Siting of the dairy farms is done in coordination with the local government to ensure that it \nconforms  with  local  land  use  plans  and  avoids  legally  protected  areas.  Potential  risks  and \nimpacts  during  construction  are  mostly  site-specific  and  short-term,  and  can  be  effectively \nmanaged by good engineering construction and housekeeping practices implemented through a \nconstruction  environmental  management  plan.  During  operation,  the  new  waste  management \nfacilities will contribute to address concerns on solid waste and wastewater disposal, which has \nthe  potential for  surface and groundwater  pollution.  Since  the farms  will  be  located  away  from \ninhabited areas, nuisance, noise, and odor impacts will be mitigated. \n \n25. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  envisaged  because  SKX  will  avoid  forest  and \nbasic farmland and will lease state-owned land or unused and wasteland from land owners and \nvillages on a willing-lessor\u2013willing-lessee basis. Future expansion activities are expected to be \ncarried out in the northern part of the PRC, which has sufficient land resources. In unavoidable \ncases where basic farmland will be used, village collectives typically provide replacement land \nto  these  villagers  to  minimize  impacts  on  their  livelihoods.  Impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are \nunlikely, and SKX\u2019s operations are not expected to have impacts on identity, culture, and natural \nresource-based  livelihoods.  In  ethnic  minority  autonomous  regions  where  SKX  operates,  SKX \nwill avoid leasing land used by ethnic minority groups. The company will offer jobs to willing and \nqualified  workers,  including  those  from  ethnic  minorities,  who  will  benefit  from  the  additional \nincome and new livestock breeding skills and information. \n \n26. \nSKX engaged a qualified and experienced external expert to conduct a corporate audit \non  the  company\u2019s  existing  environmental  and  social  policy,  procedures,  and  operations.  The \naudit  found  that  corrective  action  is  required  to  ensure  adequacy  and  compliance  of  the \nprocedures  and  operations  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  other  social \nrequirements. SKX will develop and adopt an integrated environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) satisfactory to ADB prior to the first disbursement by ADB. SKX is committed to \nboosting  its  institutional  capacity  and  procedures  to  better  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  has  set  up  a  dedicated  environment  and  social  unit  with  qualified \nstaff to manage ESMS implementation. It will also conduct ESMS training sessions for staff. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n27. \nSKX  and  its  contractors  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards.10 SKX will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith  such  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  The  project  is  categorized  as  with  some  gender \nelements. SKX will increase the employment of women from 31% in 2015 to 35% in 2020, and \ninclude  provisions  prohibiting  sexual  harassment  in  its  human  resource  policy.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nSKX was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \n28. \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n29. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n30. \nCharter), 11  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  SKX.  ADB  will  enter \ninto  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \n31. \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$125,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan\u2014comprising (i) an A-loan of up to $62,500,000 \nequivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  (ii)  a \ncomplementary loan of up to $62,500,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan\u2014to Inner Mongolia \nSaikexing Breeding and Biotechnology Group for the Sustainable Dairy Farming and Milk Safety \nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n7  June 2016 \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n10  ADB. 2003.
