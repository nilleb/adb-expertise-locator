I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmulticurrency corporate loan up to the lower of 50% (or, if the loan is covered by a risk \nparticipation agreement, up to 75%) of Cofely Southeast Asia Pte. Ltd. (Cofely) assets and \n$40 million  equivalent  in  baht,  peso,  ringgit,  rupiah,  euro,  or  US  dollar,  supported  by  a \ncomprehensive, irrevocable corporate guarantee from GDF Suez Energie Services S.A. (GSES) \nfor the Southeast Asia Energy Efficiency Project.  The report also describes proposed research \nand  development  technical  assistance  (TA) for  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Energy  Efficiency \nSector, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the research and development TA. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The adverse effects of climate change can quickly unravel poverty reduction gains in \nSoutheast Asia. With populations and infrastructure concentrated in coastal areas, economic \ndevelopment throughout the region remains exceedingly vulnerable to changing precipitation \npatterns  and  increased  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events. 1Though  the  region  only \ncontributed to 3.0% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2000, aggressive plans for \neconomic  growth  place  its  energy  sector  as  the  fastest-growing  contributor  to  emissions \n(footnote 1). The trajectory in energy-related emissions in Southeast Asia presents an untapped \nopportunity for cost-effective mitigation that can advance sustainable and low-carbon growth. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been on the forefront of accelerating private \nsector  investment  in  low-carbon  infrastructure  in  Southeast  Asia,  where  a  broad-based \nopportunity for energy efficiency improvement persists. Cofely has a proven business model2 to \nimplement and operate energy efficiency investments, strong execution ability, deep technical \nexpertise, and broad support from its parent company, GDF Suez. In developing its 2012\u20132016 \nregional  business  plan,  Cofely  identified  a  robust  pipeline  of  energy  and  environmental \nefficiency projects across Southeast Asia. ADB supports Cofely\u2019s investment plan to build, \nupgrade, and expand energy efficiency infrastructure in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Through \nfinancing and capacity development, ADB will demonstrate the limited risks and reliable returns \nassociated with a relatively untapped, yet rich category of low-carbon investment. \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project seeks to remove both the financial constraints and the information barriers \nthat inhibit the development of the energy efficiency market through a loan and parallel research \nand development TA (para. 30). Specifically, it will support the investment program of Cofely to \nexpand  and  upgrade  energy  efficiency  services  in  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  PDR, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The loan will finance long-term energy \nefficiency  solutions  in  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  Southeast  Asia  that \nguarantee  energy  savings  for  hotels,  hospitals,  large  commercial  centers,  office  buildings, \nbusiness districts, and industrial facilities, and the expansion of energy efficiency services and \nsmall-scale renewable energy generation. ADB and Cofely will finance the investment program \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. The Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia \u2013 A Regional Review.

", "2 \non a consolidated basis to reduce financing transaction costs that typically beleaguer small \nenergy efficiency projects. Cofely will be the borrower and will direct ADB funds to subprojects \nmanaged by its regional branches and subsidiaries. Moreover, ADB assistance will incorporate \nloan conditionalities such as the maintenance of satisfactory leverage ratios, a transparent \ncorporate governance structure, and the design and implementation of an environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nGSES will guarantee all principal and interest due to ADB through a comprehensive guarantee, \navailable on first demand, designed to result in a full risk transfer of ADB\u2019s exposure to GSES. \n3.  The Borrower and/or Sponsor \n5.  Cofely  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  GSES,  the  world  leader  in  energy  and \nenvironmental efficiency services, and brings 60 years of GSES energy efficiency experience to \nSoutheast Asia through offices in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. Cofely \ndesigns and implements solutions to help businesses achieve guaranteed cost savings from \nenergy  efficiency  improvements.  Revenue  comes  from  Cofely  receiving  a  designated \npercentage of cost savings achieved in exchange for energy services rendered. Cofely partners \nwith large conglomerates and retailers, multipremise owners, hospital or hotel chains, and \nproperty developers through medium-term (5\u20136 years) and long-term (7\u201310 years) contracts \noffering comprehensive solutions: (i) detailed energy audits of all equipment; (ii) engineering \n(redesign,  resize,  retrofit,  and  replace);  (iii)  financing  through  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT) \ncontracts; (iv) project management; and (v) long-term operation and maintenance.  \n \n6.  A key driver of Cofely\u2019s market leadership includes its ability to keep project costs to the \nminimum because of its independence from equipment providers. It maintains a brand-neutral \nequipment policy and exercises buying power by negotiating acquisition and spare parts prices \nfor equipment at the GDF Suez group level worldwide.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n4.  The Guarantor \n7.  Parent company. GDF Suez is the largest utility company in the world with operations \nin 70 countries. It was formed in 2008 from the merger of energy company Suez and power \ncompany Gaz de France, and is active in electricity generation, gas, energy efficiency, waste, \nand water. It participates throughout the energy and environmental value chain via six main \nbusiness lines: Energy France, Energy Europe & International, Infrastructure, Global Gas and \nLiquid Natural Gas, Energy Services, and Suez Environment. In 2011, GDF Suez had over \n117 gigawatts in installed power generation capacity and revenues of \u20ac90.7 billion ($118 billion). \nGDF Suez is rated A by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A1 by Moody\u2019s. Its excellent business risk \nprofile is supported by the group\u2019s scale and diversification as the world\u2019s largest gas and \nelectricity utility, as well as its sizable share of regulated and contracted operations, new and \nclean power generation assets, and broad and highly diversified gas sourcing.3  \n \n8.  Guarantor. GSES is the leader in energy efficiency and environmental services and a \nwholly owned subsidiary of GDF Suez. With its various subsidiaries, GSES channels more than \n60 years of experience in supplying locally produced energies and utilities to serve 130,000 \ncustomers,  operate  180  heating  and  cooling  networks,  and  manage  48  public\u2013private \npartnerships in over 1,300 locations across 30 countries worldwide. Key GSES brands include \nCofely, Axima, Endel, Ineo, Fabricom, and Tractebel Engineering. GSES\u2019 total revenues on a \nconsolidated basis were \u20ac14.2 billion ($18 billion)\u2014representing an increase of 5.3% year-on-\n                                                \n3  Standard & Poor\u2019s. 2012.

GSES benefits from \ntangible group-level support as a core subsidiary of GDF Suez.  \n \n9.  GDF Suez Energie Services' strategy for Asia. The parent company, GDF Suez, has \nbeen  active  for  many  years  in  all  its  business  areas  across  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region: \nelectricity generation, liquid natural gas, and energy and environmental services. It has an \nexisting installed capacity of 13 gigawatts and employs 11,000 people in the region. According \nto the 2011 Asia growth strategy, the group seeks to further accelerate its business in Asia over \nthe next 5 years.4 Subsequently, GSES plans to scale up regional operations significantly by \nremoving key hurdles that inhibit energy efficiency market growth, building on its successful \nservices platform and vast experience as the world leader in energy efficiency. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impact. The project will play a pioneering role in demonstrating the viability of smaller-\nscale clean energy projects in the Asia and Pacific region. The demonstration effect is expected \nto encourage more investment in clean energy, specifically energy efficiency in ADB Southeast \nAsia DMCs. Additionally, with reduced information barriers, proven net savings, and greater \naccess to financing, the demand for energy efficiency solutions will grow, stimulating greater \nprovision of energy efficiency services in the region and, subsequently, more qualified full-\nservice ESCOs. Energy savings are a promising and cost-effective mechanism to close the gap \nbetween energy demand and supply. ADB DMCs in Southeast Asia must enable private sector \nparticipation to develop and finance a substantial amount of energy efficiency projects to help \nmeet their growing energy demand and climate mitigation targets. The demonstrational effect \nwill provide a model for other ESCOs to replicate and BOT investors to follow in terms of \nfinancial structuring and environmental and social standards. \n \n11.  Outcome.  The  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  the  demonstrated  viability  of  energy \nefficiency investment across several ADB DMCs through realized energy savings, emission \nreduction, and net savings. The research and development TA will further promote industry \ngrowth by raising awareness among senior managers across the region and by identifying \nspecific opportunities with the highest energy savings potential. \n \n12.  Outputs.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  implementation  and  operation  of  energy \nefficiency projects in target ADB DMCs, and (ii) greater awareness and market information on \nenergy efficiency investment benefits. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The Project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020,5 which aims to reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life by scaling \nup  private  sector  development  and  supporting  environmentally  sustainable  models through \nprojects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change challenges. \n \n                                                \n4  GDF Suez. 2011.

The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 6 which  supports  wider  access  to  energy  through \ninvestments in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. In 2013, ADB will raise its \nclean energy investment target to $2 billion a year from the present $1 billion in a bid to \naccelerate low-carbon growth and reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions. ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategies for various ADB DMCs (including two target DMCs, Thailand and the \nPhilippines)  echo  the  themes  of  the  energy  policy,  promoting  energy  security  and \nenvironmentally sustainable economic development.7 \n \n15.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  As  discussed  in  the  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s recent review of ADB energy efficiency interventions, ADB has long considered \nenergy efficiency improvement to be a highly cost-effective alternative to increasing energy \navailability: 1 megawatt of power capacity saved costs about half that of adding equivalent coal-\nfired power-generating capacity.8 Review of past ADB loans in energy efficiency indicate the \nneed to focus on removing market barriers (i.e. poor awareness among energy users, high risk \nperception  of  most  commercial  banks  and  relatively  poor  credibility  of  ESCOs).  Other \ndevelopment partners note that the efficacy of financial assistance can be heightened with TA \nfor project origination. Current project design integrates these key lessons and aims to arrive at \na more replicable and impactful model for the industry. \nD.

The research and development TA for Southeast Asia Regional Energy Efficiency Sector \nwill be processed simultaneously with the loan. ADB will be the executing agency managing the \nfunds and implementation.9 Through the $600,000 research and development TA, ADB plans to \nraise awareness of energy efficiency throughout the region among commercial managers and \nindustry  associations,  and  facilitate  further  commercial  financing  in  the  sector  through \ndiscussions with financial institutions. Similar to the loan, the target ADB DMCs are Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Key tasks involve: \nestablishing a tangible track record of heating, cooling and compressed-air energy efficiency \ninvestments through benchmarking analyses; preparing case studies for hotels, hospitals, and \ndistrict cooling; and analyzing the ESCO competitive landscape. Planned awareness-raising \nworkshops  aim  to  facilitate  dialogue  among  ESCOs,  banks  and  leaders  in  hospitality, \nhealthcare, finance, and food industries in cooperation with sustainable energy development \nauthorities of the target countries. The scope of work and communication strategy will be refined \nin consultation with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), Southeast \nAsia Regional Department (SERD) and Department of External Relations (DER) to ensure that \nthe TA complements ADB-wide energy efficiency strategy.  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  is  classified  as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The environment category was determined based on possible inclusion of \ncategory B projects in the future, although the current portfolio has only category C projects. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been defined and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  borrower  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment of Cofely to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. Cofely will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy10 and report regularly to \nADB on the compliance (including by contractors) with national labor laws and adherence to \ninternationally recognized core labor standards. Information disclosure and consultations with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11  \n                                                \n9  ADB will be the recruiting entity and the TA will be funded through ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV).
