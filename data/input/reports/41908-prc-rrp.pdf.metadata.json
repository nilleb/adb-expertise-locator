The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nThe Airport Sector \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \nWith a total area of 9.6 million square kilometers (km2), a population of 1.3 billion, and \n2. \ngross domestic product of $2.67 trillion in 2006, the PRC remains the leading emerging market \nin Asia. With a sustained growth rate of 9.5% over the past 26 years, the economy of the PRC \ncontinues  to  benefit  from  the  comparative  advantage  of  lower  labor  costs,  higher  productivity \nlevels and increased ease of global movement of goods and services. The civil aviation industry \nhas  benefited  from  this  growth  through  increased  demand  for  both  cargo  and  passenger \nservices.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  (the  Government)  recognizes  the  importance  of \ninfrastructure  as  a  prerequisite  for  economic  growth,  and  has  focused  on  the  development  of \nland, sea and air transport.     \n \n\n2. \n\nDemand for Air Transportation \n\n \n3. \nThe  PRC  currently  has  the  second  largest  civil  aviation  market  in  the  world,  after  the \nUnited  States.  In  2006,  the  General  Administration  of  Civil  Aviation  of  China  (CAAC)  reported \npassenger \ntransportation  volume  of  332  million  person-times  and  cargo  and  postal \ntransportation  of  7.53  million  tons  (t),  increasing  by  16.7%  and  19%  respectively,  over  2005 \nlevels.  Average  annual  passenger  growth  stood  at  22.1%,  and  average  annual  cargo  traffic \ngrowth at 22.0% over the past decade.  \n \nThe  demand  for  travel,  for  both  work  and  leisure,  is  projected  to  increase  at  an \n4. \nunprecedented pace as a result of increased labor movement flexibility and disposable income \ngrowth.  It  is  estimated  that  Chinese  air  passenger  transportation  throughput,  measured  in \nrevenue passenger-kilometers (RPK),1 will average 8.4% annually during 2007\u20132026, while the \nPRC\u2019s air cargo transportation turnover, measured in freight ton-kilometers (FTK),2 will increase \nat an annual average of 10.5%.3\n \n\nDevelopment of Airport Sector \n\n3. \n \n\n \n                                                \n1  RPK is a measure of airline passenger volume calculated by multiplying the number of revenue passengers carried \n\non each flight stage by the flight stage distance. \n\n2   FTK is a measure of airline freight volume calculated by multiplying freight carried on each flight stage by the flight \n\nstage distance. \n\n3   Research in China. 2007. China Air Transportation and Airport Industry Report. Beijing. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n   \n\nThe  PRC  had  146  civil  airports  in  operation  in  2006.  There  were  7  airports  with \n5. \nthroughput  capacity  for  10  million  passengers,  12  with  capacity  for  5\u201310  million,  and  25  with \ncapacity for 1\u20135 million.4 Seven of the top ten airports in the PRC have experienced double-digit \ngrowth rates over the past 20 years and continue to expand, both in scale and number. \n \n6. \nDuring  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  CNY110  billion  ($13.25  billion)  was \ninvested in hub and regional airport construction in the PRC. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010) continues to reflect the Government\u2019s emphasis on development of the airport sector. It \nstipulates  the  construction  and  expansion  of  some  60  airports,  mostly  in  the  western  region. \nMoreover, almost all existing airports need rehabilitation. It is estimated that about $17.7 billion \nin capital expenditure is required for the civil airports in the 11th Five-Year Plan. It is projected \nthat  more  than  237  civil  airports  will  come  into  operation  by  2010.  From  2006  to  2020,  CAAC \nestimates that the number of airports is projected to grow 11% annually. \n\n \n4. \n\nGovernment Policies and Regulations \n\nBefore 2003, all civil airports were directly controlled by CAAC, and most of them were \n7. \nsuffering  losses.  Since  2004,  all  civil  airports  (except  those  in  Beijing  and  Tibet)  have  been \ntransferred  to  provincial  and/or  municipal  governments.  Although  the  local  governments  can \nbetter  plan  and  coordinate  the  development  of  airports  together  with  other  infrastructure \nfacilities, the capital expenditure required to expand and/or rehabilitate airports is an additional \nburden  on  local  fiscal  budgets.  This  is  especially  the  case  in  the  central  and  western  regions, \nwhere  municipal  and  provincial  governments  are  constrained  by  (i)  their  limited  financial \nbudgets  and  overall  infrastructure  needs,  (ii)  lack  of  direct  access  to  multilateral  or  other \nexternal  financing  sources,  and  (iii)  inability  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart  funding \nrequirements.  \n \n8. \nIn 2002, the Provisions on Foreign Investment in Civil Aviation were promulgated, which \nallow  for  up  to  25%  foreign  ownership,  with  approval  from  the  National  Development  and \nReform  Commission  (NDRC)  and  CAAC.  A  majority  of  shares  must  remain  with  the  domestic \nChinese  partner,  however.  In  2005,  CAAC  passed  the  Provision  on  Domestic  Investments  on \nCivil  Aviation  Industry  and  the  Provision  on  Administration  of  Alliance,  Reorganization  or \nRestructuring  of  Civil  Aviation,  which  detail  the  regulatory  framework  for  participation  of \ndomestic private sector investment in civil aviation. \n \n\n5. \n\n Tariff and Price  \n\n \n9. \nThe  current  airport  pricing  mechanism  is  enacted  by  CAAC  with  approval  from  NDRC. \nCAAC  issues  detailed  pricing  standards  for  landing  fees,  passenger  processing  and  ground \nhandling  fees.  Overall,  the  airport  tariff  structure  does  not  take  into  consideration  the  capital \nintensive  nature  of  airports  and  is  biased  towards  airports  with  larger  passenger  and  cargo \nvolumes. The charges are based on a uniform formula used by CAAC, regardless of differences \nin  operational  and  capital  expenditures.  Because  the  fee  received  is  directly  correlated  with \naggregate  passenger  throughput,  smaller  airports  with  lower  throughput  often  have  difficulties \nwith long-term profitability and operational sustainability.  \n \n10.  Under a new CAAC pricing proposal, it is very likely that the overall charges will increase, \nwith charges on domestic routes increasing substantially. Almost all airports will benefit from the \n\n                                                 \n4   CAAC. 2007. Civil Aviation Sector Overview. Beijing. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nreform  plan,  especially  small  and  medium-sized  airports  that  derive  all  their  business  from \ndomestic routes.  \n \n\n5. \n\n Constraints in Private Sector Participation  \n\n \n11. \nThe operation of civil airports requires special knowledge and sector-specific experience \nthat most local governments lack, reducing the efficiency of airports. Private sector participation, \naccompanied by funding and experience, is clearly needed in development of the airport sector \nin  the  PRC,  especially  in  the  central  and  western  regions.  However,  experienced  foreign \noperators  are  focusing  on  investments  in  hub  or  large  airports  in  the  coastal  region,  so  as  to \ncreate  synergies  with  their  existing  operations  and  minimize  investment  risks.  As  a  result, \npotential investors and/or operators for medium and small airports are likely to be from domestic \nmarket.  \n \n12. \nLocal  investors  and/or  operators  are  typically  relatively  new  and  have  limited  financial \nresources,  limiting  their  capacity  to  develop  a  large  number  of  projects.  Moreover,  the  local \nfinancing  market,  especially  for  the  central  and  western  PRC,  is  unfavorable  to  the  private \nsector. Long-term private sector financing, which is desperately needed in the airport sector, is \nnearly  nonexistent,  limiting  local  private  sector  participation,  especially  in  small  and  medium \nairports, and restricting mobilization of resources for the sector. Consequently, priority needs to \nbe  given  to  dedicated  and  qualified  local  sponsors  of  airport  infrastructure  development  in  the \nPRC,  particularly  in  the  central  and  western  regions.  This  can  be  achieved  through  equity \ninvestments  and  long-term  local  currency  debt\u2014with  which  ADB  has  extensive  experience  in \nother, similar sectors\u2014which can in turn mobilize other financing. \n \nB. \n\nADB Operations, Strategy and Sector Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC 5   is  based  on  five  development  objectives: \n13. \n(i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) making markets work better, (iii) improving the \nenvironment,  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation,  and  (v)  private  sector  development  and \noperations.  This  is  consistent  with  priorities  highlighted  in  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II \n2006\u20132008 (MTS II),6 including (i) catalyzing investment to improve the investment climate and \nexpand private sector operations, (ii) strengthening inclusiveness through increasing investment \nto support rural development and social development interventions, and (iii) promoting regional \ncooperation  and  integration.  In  the  PRC,  ADB  is  enhancing  its  focus  on  achieving  a  better \ndevelopment balance between rural and urban areas, and between coastal and inland regions. \nThe emphasis on infrastructure projects in rural areas and less-developed central and western \nregions has increased.  \n \n14. \nThe PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to ADB\u2019s policy advice \nto  the  Government  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  also  provides  project-based  financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy  sectors,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance. As agreed with the Government, ADB private sector operations \nwill  identify  and  support  viable  projects  that  are  located  in  the  less-developed  central  and \n\n                                                \n \n5   ADB. 2006.

The Project aims \nto (i) enhance the development of efficient medium and small airports in the central and western \nPRC  through  private  sector  participation;  (ii)  ease  the  financial  constraints  being  faced  by \nprovincial and/ or municipal governments through mobilization of private sector capital; and (iii) \nsupport  regional  economic  growth  and  equitable  economic  development  of  the  country. \nProceeds  from  the  ADB  loan  and  equity  participation  will  be  channeled  through  HAG  to  the \nportfolio airports in the central and western PRC. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nPrivatization \n\n16. \nHAG procures the ownership and management rights to all its portfolio airports through \nprivatization, so both new and existing portfolio airports generate revenue and cash flow. HAG \nhas  its  own  team  to  conduct  pre-privatization  evaluation  and  negotiation,  with  support  from \nexternal  professionals.  The  pre-privatization  evaluation  is  typically  very  comprehensive, \ncovering  legal,  engineering,  operational  and  financial  aspects.  Each  privatization  structure  is \nunique, but all transactions are well documented and approved by various government agencies, \nincluding  the  State-owned  Assets  Supervision  and  Administration  Commission  (SASAC)  and \nCAAC.  The  privatization  agreements  define  the  rights  and  obligations  of  HAG  and  local \ngovernments, with implementation closely monitored by various government agencies.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n17. \nHAG  and  its  portfolio  airports  abide  by  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws \nrelated  to  airport  operations.  HAG  conducts  environmental  impact  assessments  for  all  of  its \nprojects and applies for all required permits when implementing projects and operating project \nfacilities. Where environmental impacts related to construction and operation of airport terminal \nand  associated  facilities  exist,  these  are  rendered  \u201cnot  significant\u201d  through  implementation  of \nappropriate monitoring and mitigation measures. \n \n18. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  FI  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003)  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Due  diligence  was \nconducted  on  the  environmental,  safety,  and  health  aspects  of  HAG\u2019s  current  operations  to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  HAG\u2019s  environmental  management  is \nconsidered  satisfactory  and  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  and  local  policies.  In  addition,  HAG  will  ensure \nthat  environmental  monitoring  for  all  future  operations  of  each  subsidiary  company  is \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.  HAG  is  establishing  environment \nmanagement  systems  (EMSs),  including  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  HAG  will  also  ensure  it  complies  with  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nregulations.  HAG  will  periodically  confirm  with  ADB  its  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental requirements, and make reports on these matters available to ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n\n19. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  A  with  respect  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and category B with respect to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Due \ndiligence  was  conducted  on  the  social  aspects  of  HAG\u2019s  current  operations.  With  respect  to \nHAG\u2019s  planned  expansion,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  could  have  substantial \nimpact,  which  cannot  be  identified  at  this  stage.  HAG  has  expressed  the  intention  to  avoid \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  if  at  all  possible,  and/or  to \nadopt  measures  to  minimize  land  acquisition  or  other  activities  that  would  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement.  In  the  event  of  involuntary  resettlement  or  any  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic \nminorities  as  a  result  of  HAG\u2019s  investment,  HAG  will  ensure  that  resettlement  plans  and/or \nethnic  minority  development  plans  are  prepared  and  implemented  consistent  with  the \nrequirements of ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy and Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and \nin accordance with the Social Safeguards Management Framework. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\nThe Project serves as an important catalyst for the overall economic growth of the PRC\u2019s \n20. \nless-developed  central  and  western  regions.  Airport  facilities  with  inadequate  passenger  and \ncargo capacity and service constitute the major aviation infrastructure bottleneck in the central \nand  western  PRC.  Through  assistance  to  HAG  in  increasing  airport  capacity  and  improving \nairport efficiency in the central and western PRC, the Project will directly benefit the people in \nthe  area  by  (i)  providing  direct  access  to  and  from  markets  in  both  the  PRC\u2019s  relatively \ndeveloped  coastal  regions  and  in  other  countries,  (ii)  improving  aviation  safety  and  level  of \nservice,  (iii)  reducing  the  cost  and  duration  of  long  distance  travel,  and  (iv)  creating  more \nemployment  demand  and  opportunities.  According  to  an  estimate  by  the  International  Civil \nAviation  Organization,  every  $100  of  output  from  air  transport  generates  triple  that  much \ndemand, and 100 air transport jobs induce 610 jobs in other industries. \n \nThe  Project  promotes  private  sector  participation  in  airport  development  in  the  PRC, \n21. \nthereby increasing the amount of available private capital in the civil aviation sector, which is a \nfocus  for  improving  the  country\u2019s  long-distance  transportation.  HAG,  a  local  private  sector \ndeveloper  based  in  a  relatively  advanced  coastal  region,  will  transfer  its  financial  resources, \nsuccessful  experience  and  good  practice  to  the  less-developed  central  and  western  PRC  in  a \nsustainable  manner  through  privatization  of  loss-making  airports.  The  privatization  of  these \nairports will ultimately eliminate airport subsidies now being made by local governments, freeing \nup  local  government  resources  for  other  critical  expenditures  related  to  social  concerns  and \nhealth. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  development  of  local  capital  markets \nthrough its use of locally raised funds. If the Project is implemented, and subject to Government \napproval, ADB will issue its second CNY-denominated bond (Panda Bond) to fund the Project, \nthereby assisting the Government to further improve the bond market in the PRC. The Project \nwill also increase the efficiency of the local financing market. ADB\u2019s CNY-denominated loan will \ncatalyze risk participation by international commercial banks, which otherwise could not finance \na  project  requiring  CNY  financing  due  to  a  lack  of  CNY  funding  capacity.  The  Project \nestablishes  an  excellent  platform  for  international  commercial  banks,  which  have  the  risk \nappetite to provide long-term local currency loans, but limited capacity to do so. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n   \n\n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n23. \nThe  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  is  assessed  in  terms  of  private  sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of  multilateral  development  banks. \nHAG  will  be  in  a  position  to  comfortably  fund  the  privatization,  expansion,  rehabilitation, \nimprovement  and  operation  of  airports  in  the  central  and  western  PRC,  thereby  improving \ncapacity  and  enhancing  service.  The  increase  in  passenger  and  cargo  traffic  volume  in  its \nportfolio airports will lead to increased revenue and reinforce HAG\u2019s financial sustainability and \ncontinuous  operations.  On  a  broader  level,  the  development  effectiveness  is  reflected  in  the \nincreased  capacity  and  enhanced  service  levels  in  HAG\u2019s  portfolio  airports  in  the  central  and \nwestern PRC. The impact of this can be observed by assessing the quantity and quality of the \nrelated aeronautical operations in the area.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nEquity Investment \n\nThe proposed equity investment is to subscribe ordinary shares in HAG7 at a cost of up \n24. \nto  $50  million,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  The  terms  and  conditions, \nincluding valuation, representations, warranties, covenants, etc, of ADB\u2019s equity investment will \nbe similar to other equity investment to HAG at about the same time.  \n \n25. \nThe  proposed  ADB  equity  investment  constitutes  a  critical  and  integral  part  of  ADB \nassistance  for  HAG  and  the  Project.  Although  HAG  has  already  achieved  significant  success \nand  established  sound  reputation  in  the  sector,  HAG  is  at  the  starting  point  of  its  planned \nexpansion and IPO. HAG has been actively seeking strategic investors to ensure its continued \ngrowth  in  the  rapidly  expanding  sector.  ADB  is  expected  to  assist  HAG  to  enhance  its  good \ncorporate governance and improve its environmental and social management system.  \n \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  will  be  documented  appropriately,  and  all  contractual \n26. \nand financial arrangements should be satisfactory to ADB. The disbursement will be subject to \ncomprehensive  conditions  precedent,  including  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and \nshareholder approvals and consents. \n \nB. \n\nLoan \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  will  comprise  an  A  Tranche  funded  by  ADB  and  a  B  Tranche \n\n27. \nfunded by commercial banks. \n \n28. \nThe  A  Tranche  is  for  up  to  CNY1.2  billion,  or  about  $160  million  equivalent.  The  A \nTranche  will  be  funded  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  without  government  guarantee,  but  with  a  50%  risk \nparticipation from international commercial banks to cover  up to CNY600 million of ADB\u2019s risk \nexposure under the A Tranche. \n \n\n                                                \n \n7   ADB  may  structure  the  proposed  equity  investment  through  an  offshore  special  purpose  company  to  be  set  up \n\ntogether with other investors. This is in line with international practice.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nThe A Tranche will be funded through the proceeds of a CNY-denominated bond issued \n29. \nby  ADB.  The  A  Tranche  will  have  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nprocedures applicable to ADB local currency loans.  \n \nThe  B  Tranche  of  up  to  $200  million  will  be  funded  by  international  commercial  banks \n30. \nunder  terms  and  conditions  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon  between  HAG  and  the  participating \ncommercial banks, with the concurrence of ADB.  \n \nThe proposed loan will be documented in loan agreements, which will contain standard \n31. \nterms  and  conditions  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers  without  government \nguarantee. The terms of the loan will include financial and operational covenants and reporting \nrequirements. \n \nC. \n\nJustification   \n\n32. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \ndemonstration  effects.  It  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will produce substantial added value. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy  to  enhance  economic  development  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  central \nand  western  PRC,  which  is  the  key  theme  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  The \nstrategy  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and \ncoastal  regions.  The  Project  is  also  in  line  with  the  civil  aviation  policy  in \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  has  accorded  priority \nthe \ndevelopment of airport infrastructure in the central and western regions.  \n\nto \n\nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  airport  sector,  given  the  substantial  investment  required  to \nexpand  and  improve  airport  facilities  and  the  limited  self-financing  capacity  of \nlocal  governments.  The  Project  is  expected  to  free  the  resources  of  local \ngovernments  from  local  airport  investment  and  operations,  making  them \navailable for other critical expenditures related to social concerns and health. \n\nThe Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program in the PRC. \nADB is focusing its activities on promoting equitable and inclusive growth, with a \nstrong  emphasis  on  infrastructure  projects  in  rural  areas  and  less-developed \ncentral and western regions. The Project will substantially impact the balance of \ndevelopment between coastal and inland regions. \n\nThe Project will be the first airport project supported by ADB in the PRC, and will \nbe  ADB\u2019s  first  long-term  local  currency  financing  in  the  transportation  sector, \nwhere  such  financing  is  desperately  needed.  It  complements  ADB\u2019s  existing \npublic operations in the PRC\u2019s transportation sector (mainly in the road subsector) \nby easing a major transportation sector constraint: airport capacity and efficiency.  \n\nThe Project reflects the infrastructure focus of ADB\u2019s non-sovereign operations in \nthe  PRC.  In  the  infrastructure  sector,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with \ninnovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove  corporate \ngovernance. The Project will enable HAG, a local private sector airport developer, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n   \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nto  transfer  its  financial  resources,  successful  experience,  and  good  practice  to \nthe  less  developed  central  and  western  PRC  in  a  sustainable  manner  through \nprivatization  of  loss-making  airports,  which  are  essential  infrastructure  facilities \nfor  economic  growth.  ADB  will  assist  HAG  to  mobilize  long-term  local  currency \nfinancing, which is not currently available in the market, by easing the concerns \nof private equity investors, who will co-invest with ADB in HAG.  \n\nThe  Project  will  have  positive  impacts  on  the  development  of  the  local  capital \nmarket  and  local  financing  market.  The  CNY-denominated  A  Tranche  will  be \nfunded by a CNY-denominated bond issued by  ADB, the issuance of which will \nassist the Government to improve the bond market in the PRC. The loan will also \ncatalyze financing from international commercial banks, including those with the \nrisk appetite, but limited capacity, to provide long-term local currency loans. \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  total  financial  plan  by \nsatisfying funding requirements and mobilizing additional funds from international \nbanks and private equity investors, but will also assist in attracting private sector \ninvestors  by  enhancing  the  institutional  capacity  of  HAG.  With  potential  board \nrepresentation  throughout  the  period  that  ADB  holds  shares,  ADB  will  support \nHAG  in  (i)  strengthening  its  institutional  capacity,  (ii)  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance, and (iii) developing a formal environmental and social management \nsystem  for  HAG\u2019s  continued  growth.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  will  be \nviewed  as  demonstrational  and  catalytic,  and  is  expected  to  establish  more \nconfidence  in  HNA\u2019s  upcoming  IPO  and  future  private  sector  participation  in \nairport projects in the PRC. \n\nAnticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism   \n\nHAG  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the \n33. \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require HAG to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing \nof  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  loan  and \nequity  documentation  between  ADB  and  HAG  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n34. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nHAG.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will  enter  into \nfinance  documents  acceptable  to  ADB  following  the  approval  of  the  proposed  financing  by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n35. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  and  loan  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  equity  investment  in  HNA  Airport  Group  Company,  Limited  for  an  amount  up  to \n$50,000,000 to be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and \n\nthe loan, to HNA Airport Group Company, Limited, consisting of (a) an A Tranche in an \namount  of  up  to  CNY1,200,000,000  funded  by  ADB  and  supported  by  a  50%  risk \nparticipation from international commercial banks rated A or above, to be provided from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without  government  guarantee;  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined based on the procedures applicable to ADB local currency loans for private \nsector  operations;  and  (b)  a  B  Tranche  for  an  amount  of  up  to  $200,000,000  to  be \nfunded  by  commercial  banks  under  terms  and  conditions  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon \nbetween  HAG  and  the  participating  commercial  banks  with  the  concurrence  of  ADB, \nsubject  to  ADB\u2019s  arrangement  fee  and  annual  administration  fee  to  be  approved  by \nADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee, \n\n \nfor  the  Central  and  Western  Airports  Development  Project,  and  on  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n16 November 2007 \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1     10 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n1.
