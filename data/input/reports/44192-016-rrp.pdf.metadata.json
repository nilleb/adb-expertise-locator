THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the SASEC Second Bangladesh\u2013India Electrical \nGrid Interconnection Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project 2  will  upgrade  the  power  transmission  capacity  of  the  existing  grid \ninterconnection between Bangladesh and India from 500 megawatts (MW) to 1,000 MW.3 This \nwill allow Bangladesh to increase the import of electricity from India to meet increasing power \ndemand. The power grid of western Bangladesh at Bheramara and the power grid of eastern \nIndia  at  Baharampur  were  first  successfully  interconnected  in  2013  through  the  first \nBangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection Project, which was financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 1971, when Bangladesh gained independence, only 3% of the population had access \nto  electricity.  In  2015, this  had  risen  to  over  70%,  with  per  capita  electricity  consumption \nreaching 321 kilowatt-hours per annum.5 The power generation capacity of Bangladesh was \n10,817 megawatts (MW) in January 2015. Natural gas is the main source of primary energy for \npower generation in Bangladesh, and 63% of generation capacity is based on domestic gas.6 \nDomestic natural gas supplies in Bangladesh have not kept pace with growing demand, and this \nhas resulted in an increasing dependence on power generation from quickly deployable oil- and \ndiesel-based  power  plants  that  have  reached  an  installed  capacity  of  over  2,500  MW. \nBangladesh recorded a peak supply of over 7,700 MW in 2014. However, the installation of oil- \nand  diesel-based  power  plants  has  cost  implications  as  oil-  and  diesel-based  power  is \nsignificantly more expensive compared to natural gas.  \n \n4.  The Government of Bangladesh has an ambitious target to achieve electricity for all by \n2021 (i.e., within 50 years from the date of independence), and is working to meet the target of \n24,000 MW of generating capacity by 2021.7 Programs under implementation include improving \nthe efficiency of existing gas-based generation power plants; developing new power plants \nbased  on  fuel  sources  including  coal,  imported  gas,  and  renewable  energy;  as  well  as \ndevelopment  of  cross-border  grid  interconnections  to  exchange  power  within  South  Asia, \nstarting with India. In addition to investments in generation and the purchase of power over \ninternational  transmission  interconnections,  significant  investments  in  transmission  and \ndistribution networks are planned in Bangladesh for electricity to reach customers. ADB is \nsupporting  efficiency  improvements  in  power  generation,  renewable  energy  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution network investments. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance to Bangladesh for SASEC \nSecond Bangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection Project (TA 8823-BAN). \n3  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

", "2   \n \n5.  In  2010,  a  joint  communiqu\u00e9  on  electrical  grid  connectivity  was  signed  between \nBangladesh and India, signaling support on cross-border power interconnection and potential \nfor electricity trade between the two countries.8 In October 2013, the electricity grids of the two \nneighboring countries were connected for the first time. This first Indian national power grid \nconnection with the Bangladesh national power grid was supported under the ADB-financed \nBangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection Project, and 500 MW of power flows were \nachieved from India to Bangladesh in 2013. Connecting the two national grids resulted in power \nflows of over 2,000 gigawatt-hours from India to Bangladesh in 2014, resulting in improved \npower availability, reduced cost of electricity, fewer power interruptions, and improved power \nquality (particularly in western Bangladesh). Based on the success of the first interconnection, \nthe two countries agreed to expand cooperation in the power sector. Bangladesh will procure an \nadditional 500 MW of power over the upgraded interconnection from India.9 In addition to the \ntransmission interconnection between the two countries, India and Bangladesh are working to \nenhance cooperation in rail and road connectivity that are supported by ADB under the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program.10 \n \n6.  At the regional level, the member countries of the South Asia Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC) signed a framework agreement for energy cooperation in Kathmandu in \nNovember 2014 to identify and implement priority regional energy projects.11 Analytical studies, \nincluding  the  SAARC  Regional  Energy  Trade Study,  have  identified the  1,000  MW  power \ntransmission connection between India and Bangladesh as an important building block for the \nregional South Asian power grid enhancement.12 The regional SAARC transmission grid will \nresult in several benefits, including increased operational efficiency; improved system reliability; \nand the tapping of new power resources, particularly new hydropower capacity in Bhutan, India, \nand Nepal.13 The project meets two of the focus areas of ADB\u2019s South Asia regional cooperation \nstrategy: (i) the improvement of cross-border electricity transmission connectivity, and (ii) the \nboosting of power trade in the region.14 The project supports the regional cooperation and \nintegration  priorities  under  ADB's  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  the  regional \ncooperation operations business plan.15 \n \n7.  In India, the Central Electricity Authority reported a countrywide installed capacity of \n274,817 MW as of June 2015 against a peak demand of 143,550 MW. The Central Electricity \nAuthority reported a reduction in the peak deficit from over 10% in 2011 to 2.3% in 2015. India \nadded nearly 55,000 MW of capacity over the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period from 2007 to \n2012, and it expects to add over 88,000 MW of conventional power capacity during 2012\u20132017, \nof which over 54,000 MW has been completed as of 2015. India is simultaneously embarking on \na program that will add 175,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2022. Some regions of \nIndia have surplus energy, and a competitive market for power trading exists, with about 10% of \n                                                \n8  This was signed by the Power Secretaries of Bangladesh and India and helped conclude a process initiated in \n1997 when ADB facilitated dialogue between Bangladesh and India to identify possibilities of exchange of power. \n9  The joint steering committee meeting was held in Dhaka on 3 April 2014. It concluded Bangladesh could procure \n500 MW from the Indian electricity market, and the enhancement of the interconnection capacity to 1000 MW. \n10 SASEC was started in 2001 to bring together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in a \nproject-based partnership to promote regional prosperity by improving cross-border connectivity, boosting trade \namong member countries, and strengthening regional economic cooperation. http://www.sasec.asia/ \n11 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), setup in 1985, is an economic and geopolitical \norganization of eight countries in South Asia with its secretariat in Kathmandu, Nepal. http://www.saarc-sec.org/  \n12 SASEC. 2010.

Lessons  learned  from  ongoing  projects. The loan for the first  Bangladesh\u2013India \nElectrical  Grid  Interconnection  Project  was  approved  in  August  2010.  A  power  purchase \nagreement (PPA) for 250 MW was entered into between the trading arm of India\u2019s National \nThermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in \n2012. The cost of power was set based on the terms and conditions for the power generation \nplants  determined  by  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  of  India.  The  first \ncompetitively tendered cross-border PPA for 250 MW was signed in 2013 between PTC India \nand  the  BPDB,  and  was  supported  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  ADB.16 The  first \nBangladesh\u2013India  Electrical  Grid  Interconnection  Project  has  been  performing  satisfactorily \nsince 2013. During the processing phase for the first project, there had been perceived risk on \nthe  likelihood  of  power  transfers  not  happening  between  the  two  countries,  and  whether \nsuppliers in India would sell power to Bangladesh. In 2015, 500 MW of power flow was taking \nplace, and several power traders in India have submitted bids to sell 250 MW of power to \nBangladesh starting from 2016 when the existing short term contract for 250 MW concludes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the project is aligned with the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, 2012 \nwhich aims to increase the availability and sustainability of power supply by 2021. The outcome \nof the project is increased cross-border power trade between Bangladesh and India. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The  project  comprises  two  outputs:  (i)  enhanced  Behrampur\u2013Bheramara  power \ntransmission  link  through  (a)  the  installation  of  an  additional  asynchronous17 400-kilovolt \n(kV)/230 kV 500 MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back substation in Bheramara, \nand (b) the construction of 12 kilometers of 230 kV transmission line from the  Bheramara \nsubstation to the Ishurdi substation and associated facilities; and (ii) improved capacity of the \nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) on technical, project management, regulatory, \ntrading and financial matters. \n \nD.

To ensure effective \nimplementation, PGCB set up a project management unit in December 2014, headed by a \nproject director. The Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), the central transmission utility of \nIndia,  has  been  contracted  by  the government  to  provide  technical  consulting  and  project \nmanagement services to PGCB. For review and coordination, the joint working group, set up in \n2010  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  both  governments  and  electricity  utilities  of \nBangladesh and India, meets regularly. The joint steering committee, also set up in 2010, and \ncomprising the power secretaries of both countries, provides guidance and ensures high-level \ncoordination. \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2014.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n17.  The project was designed by a joint team from PGCB and PGCIL. The team concluded \nthat the upgrade of the existing interconnection between the eastern region of India and western \nBangladesh was feasible, and the asynchronous mode of interconnection was preferred to \nfacilitate careful regulation and management of the power flows between the electrical grids of \nthe two countries, and to permit independent operation of these grids. Based on technical, \noperational, and economic considerations, the preliminary design of the second HVDC back-to-\nback substation terminal and the 230 kV transmission line in Bangladesh was completed in \n2014. Feasibility studies also confirmed that the transmission capacity of the existing 400 kV \ndouble-circuit line from Baharampur in India to Bheramara in Bangladesh is adequate for power \nevacuation of 1,000 MW. PGCIL has been appointed as a consultant to PGCB to provide \nsupport  for  the  technical  bid  evaluation  during  the  bid  process,  detailed  design  review, \nimplementation, and testing phases. Studies by PGCB and under the S-PPTA (footnote 2) \nindicate the need for support to the National Load Dispatch Center and PGCB on aspects of \nsystem planning, operation, and adherence to the grid code and these would be covered by \nconsulting assistance under the proposed loan.20 The project has been rated medium risk on \nclimate change and vulnerability. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.21 The  project\u2019s  economic  feasibility  was  assessed  from  a \nregional as well as a Bangladesh-specific perspective. The economic analysis for the project \nconsidered the benefits of resource cost savings of power generation based on alternative \nsources and, to a lesser extent, the incremental benefit during certain time periods. Power \nimports from India are part of the least-cost solution to meet increasing power requirements in \n                                                \n20 A blackout occurred on 1 November 2014. PGCB identified and subsequently implemented several short-term \nmeasures in the transmission grid to minimize the possibility of a recurrence. Medium and long-term measures \ninclude implementation of the grid code, changes in system planning and system operation as well as requirement \nfor investments in the power system.  \n21 ADB.1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "7 \n \nBangladesh. All costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2015 prices. Capital costs \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  taken  from  the  financial  data,  with \nappropriate adjustments to remove taxes and price contingencies. The project provided an \neconomic internal rate of return of 22% based on conservative assumptions of resource cost \nsavings using imported coal-based power plants as an alternative. Evaluation based either on \nprevented outage costs or resource cost savings on furnace oil or diesel (the fuels used for \nrental power plants) would provide a significantly higher economic return. The project is resilient \nto changes in the parameters, including an increase in capital and O&M costs, a reduction in the \nresource cost savings, delays in project commissioning, and a reduction in utilization of the \ninterconnection. The project returns are stable against the relevant risk factors, and the analysis \nclearly demonstrates the economic feasibility of the project. An assessment of the regional \nbenefits leads to an economic internal rate of return of 27%. The project also adds to larger \nintangible benefits of building mutual trust. The successful operation of the first interconnection \nhas already spurred similar projects in other South Asian countries and will lead to short-term \noperational optimization and support medium-term to long-term planning and development of \nregional  energy  resources.  This  will  contribute  to  the  energy  security  and  economic \ndevelopment of the region. \n \n19.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.22 All financial costs and benefits were \nexpressed  in  constant  2015  prices.  Financial  viability  was  assessed  by  comparing  the \nincremental  costs  and benefits  of the  project over  the  life  of the  project.  The  incremental \nbenefits  were  calculated  based  on  PGCB's revenue  stream.  Costs  used  to  determine  the \nfinancial internal rate of return included the capital investment, O&M costs, and taxes to install \nand operate the project. Revenues were calculated based on existing transmission tariffs until \n2016 when the applicable transmission tariff regulations of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nCommission (BERC) are considered.23 The financial internal rate of return of the project is 5%, \nwhich compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 2%, indicating \nthat the project is financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  The executing agency was assessed on ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management \nrequirements.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) have \nbeen included in the bidding documents for the project. Both procurement contracts financed by \nADB are subject to prior ADB review and included provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy was explained to and discussed with the government and PGCB. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n21.  The delay in the notification of the electricity transmission tariff regulations is a concern. \nThe process for notification of transmission tariff regulations has started in June 2015 and would \nbe completed in 2015 before disbursements commence. This is needed for better transparency, \nto link tariffs to cost of electricity and to improve PGCB\u2019s financial sustainability. PGCB is listed \non the Dhaka Stock Exchange and its financial parameters are disclosed quarterly. PGCB has \nbeen  rotating  its  external  auditors  periodically.  PGCB  is  capable  of  managing  funds  flow, \ndisbursement procedures, accounting, and financial reporting under the project.

The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n19). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Bangladesh is the eighth most populated country in the world with a population of \naround 160 million. Nearly 47% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture. \n \n23.  Despite  several  challenges,  including  natural  calamities  like  floods  and  cyclones, \nBangladesh has made steady progress towards poverty reduction and is on track to achieve the \nMillennium  Development  Goal  target  of  (i)  reducing  income  poverty  and  infant  and  child \nmortality by half, and (ii) achieving gender parity in primary and secondary schooling by 2015. \nThe rate of poverty reduction accelerated. Extreme poverty has declined significantly in both \nurban and rural areas with the proportion of rural population living in extreme poverty halving \nfrom 44% in 1992 to 21% in 2010. This can be attributed to more rapid gross domestic product \ngrowth, faster rate of urbanization, rising labor productivity and wages, a shift from low-return \nagricultural labor to nonfarm employment, and growth in export industries.  \n \n24.  The Perspective Plan 2012 outlines a target of per-capita electricity consumption of 600 \nkilowatt-hours per annum by 2021. The Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015 focused on \npoverty reduction as a key theme and this will be carried forward in the Seventh Five-Year Plan \n(footnote 5) that focusses on accelerating growth and empowering citizens.24 To achieve this, \nsufficient electrical power at affordable prices is a key prerequisite and is enunciated in the \ngoals for 100% electricity access. The project is important to improve availability of electricity \nand economic growth, particularly in western Bangladesh, which is disproportionally affected by \nelectricity shortages. \n \n25.  The project will generate jobs for the local communities during construction as a direct \nbenefit. Other impacts of the project include greater production capacity of existing industries, \nand the creation of new industries, particularly in western Bangladesh that would generate \nemployment. The project is classified as having no gender element, given the nature of the \nproposed investments in transmission infrastructure. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  From an environmental standpoint, the environmental categorization of the project is \ncategory B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), as potential negative \nenvironmental impacts, including dust and noise, are mostly temporary and reversible, and can \nbe managed through good engineering measures, design, and health and safety measures. The \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is  based  on  the  analyzed  data  collected  through \nsampling, reviews of available reports, satellite photographs, discussion with stakeholders, and \nfield visits to the project area.25 The IEE was uploaded on the ADB website in July 2015. The \nIEE  was  prepared  following  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  government's \nenvironmental impact assessment guidelines, and related national policies and legislation. The \nenvironmental management plan under the IEE is sufficient to mitigate potential impacts. The \nDepartment of Environment in Bangladesh is expected to accord the required environmental \nclearances for the project before start of construction activities in 2016. The implementation of \nthe  environmental  management  plan  will  be  supervised  by  PGCB,  and  environmental \nmonitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  semiannually.  Budgets  for  the  environmental \nmanagement plan have been approved by the government. In the event of any change in the \n                                                \n24 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2011. 6th Five Year Plan.

", "9 \n \nalignment of the transmission line or identification of any unanticipated environmental impacts \nduring the course of project implementation, PGCB will update the IEE and suitably revise the \nenvironmental management plan. \n \n27.  The project is categorized as category B for involuntary resettlement and as category C \nfor indigenous people impacts. Due diligence has confirmed that the substation site is owned \nand in the possession of PGCB since 2010, and there will be no resettlement impacts on the \nsubstation site. For the transmission line, a feasible route affecting the fewest number of people \nhas been chosen, and the transmission towers are expected to be placed on agricultural and \nfallow land. The resettlement plan was uploaded to ADB\u2019s website in July 2015. Relevant \ninformation regarding the project and the views and opinions of all affected groups were taken \ninto consideration in developing the entitlement matrix. Compensation payments will be made in \naccordance with the resettlement plan along the transmission line right of way. A grievance \nredress mechanism will be used by PGCB. The borrower has the capacity and commitment to \nmanage the social and environmental risks. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  A key risk is the availability of power in India and the limited capacity in Bangladesh to \nparticipate and purchase power from the power market in India. The government has agreed to \ninitiate the tendering process for purchase of 500 MW of power from India in 2015. The past \nexperience of signing two PPA for 250 MW each in 2012 and 2013 for the first interconnection \nand  the  timely  delivery  of  power  from  agencies  in  India  have  contributed  to  reduced  risk \nperceptions for power supply for the project. Bid process support under previous TA (footnote \n16) as well as training programs and capacity development in Bangladesh on power trading \nhelped improve familiarity within BPDB on procuring power from the Indian power market.26 \n \n29.  Another key risk is that transmission tariffs for PGCB might continue to be non-cost-\nreflective. Draft tariff regulations prepared by BERC have not been officially announced. PGCB \nfiled a petition with BERC in October 2014 to increase tariffs. BERC will announce the final \nregulations and tariff for PGCB in 2015. Other risks, such as the limited capacity of PGCB for \nproject  coordination  and  implementation  will  be  suitably  mitigated  by  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 The overall assessment of risk is low \nand the integrated benefits and impacts  of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited HVDC technology  The executing agency retained PGCIL to assist on HVDC project design, \nimplementation capacity  bidding, and implementation in Bangladesh. The first interconnection is \noperational and PGCB employees have taken over operation and \nmaintenance of the station. \n \nRequirement for assistance at the national load center and key nodes \nhas been identified and will be supported under the project. \nLimited capacity to participate  Two cross-border commercial PPA were signed in 2012 and 2013. \nand purchase power from the   \npower market  The Asian Development Bank is supporting (i) capacity development for \npower trading in Bangladesh, and (ii) tendering for 500 MW.
