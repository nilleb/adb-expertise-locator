I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment  of  up  to  $7,500,000  in  Indian  rupee  equivalent  in  Avaada  Energy  Private \nLimited (AEPL) for the Avaada Solar Phase 2 Project in India. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of an equity investment of up to $7,500,000 in Indian rupee equivalent \nto be provided by the Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP) for the Avaada Solar \nPhase 2 Project,1 and if the Board approves the proposed equity investment, I, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the  administration  of  the  LEAP  equity \ninvestment. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the German Investment Corporation (DEG), the \nNetherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), and Proparco2 are shareholders in AEPL \nand support its business plan that was approved during the previous investment round (phase 1).3 \nThese shareholders now plan to invest a further $40.0 million in AEPL to support the new solar \nphotovoltaic (PV) projects under power purchase agreements (PPA) that AEPL has subsequently \nwon as part of its expansion plans (phase 2). The proposed investment will help AEPL to expand \nits solar operating generation capacity from 666 megawatts (MW) as of June 2020 to 2,622 MW \nby March 2023. The project will help the Government of India to meet its targets for nonfossil fuel-\nbased electric power generation and reduce India\u2019s emission intensity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project  identification.  AEPL  is  promoted  by  Vineet  Mittal  (Confidential  information \nredacted) through Avaada Ventures Private Limited (AVPL or sponsor). In April 2019, ADB led an \ninvestment of $100.0 million in Indian rupee equivalent (Confidential information redacted) in \nAEPL during which ADB, DEG, FMO and LEAP invested $25.0 million each in Indian rupee \nequivalent (footnote 3). (Confidential information redacted) In November 2019, AEPL raised an \nadditional $15.0 million of equity in Indian rupee equivalent (Confidential information redacted) \nfrom Proparco. As part of this phase 1 financing, the shareholders had also negotiated an option \nto invest an additional $40.0 million by second half 2020 (Confidential information redacted). The \nexisting shareholders propose to exercise this option to invest further equity in AEPL to support \nits phase 2 expansion. \n \n4.  ADB has prior experience of working with Vineet Mittal. It invested $39 million in June \n2014 and $11 million in March 2016 in Welspun Renewables Energy Private Limited (WREPL), a \ncompany controlled by Welspun Energy Limited, which was cosponsored by Vineet Mittal and B. \nK. Goenka. WREPL grew to become India\u2019s largest solar power company, with 1,140 MW of \ncapacity, within 2 years of ADB\u2019s first investment. In 2016, ADB fully exited WREPL. AEPL was \nformed in 2017 as part of a demerger process from Welspun Energy Limited. \n \n5.  AEPL has rapidly grown and, in less than 3 years since its inception in June 2017, has \nbecome one of the five largest solar developers in India in terms of operational and under-\nconstruction capacity. (Confidential information redacted) AEPL approached ADB and the other \n \n1  Financing Partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  Proparco is a subsidiary of Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement focused on private sector development. \n3  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment \nand Administration of Equity Investment to Avaada Energy Private Limited for the Avaada Solar Project in India. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nexisting shareholders to exercise their option to invest another $40.0 million to support this growth. \nAEPL has also set an ambitious plan to reach about 4 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by \nFY2024. It had initiated an equity issuance process to support its growth plan, however, this \nprocess has been delayed because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n \n6.  COVID-19 has had the following impacts on AEPL, each of which is expected to be \ntemporary: (i) construction delays for some of AEPL\u2019s projects; (ii) increased working capital; \n(iii) delayed release of excess equity from its projects where more than the required equity capital \nwas invested because of unforeseen delays in raising debt, and to finance payment of taxes and \nduties; (iv) a delay in the sale of 26% shareholding in certain solar PV projects tied to commercial \nand industrial customers; and (v) short-term liquidity constraints affecting the sponsor\u2019s ability to \ninvest any further capital in AEPL. However, the sponsor has already invested a substantial \namount of equity capital in the company, and thus remains highly committed to it. These impacts \nhave already been factored in the revised business plan for AEPL. \n \n7.  The project provides ADB with an opportunity to further its commitment to scale up clean \nenergy financing4 through an existing client with an established execution track record. ADB\u2019s \ninitiative will support the Government of India\u2019s target to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy \ngeneration capacity by 2022, of which 100 GW is expected to be from solar power.5 The \ngovernment expects the private sector to lead the solar capacity addition. As of May 2020, \noperational utility-scale solar generation capacity in India was about 34.9 GW. While power \ndemand  fell  by  22.3%  in  April  2020  because  of  the  COVID-19-related  national  lockdown \nannounced in March 2020,6 the decline moderated to 14.9% in May and 9.7% in June 2020. This \ndisruption is expected to be temporary and, as per a 2020 report from ICRA Limited (an Indian \nratings agency and a Moody\u2019s Investors Service company), the annual power demand for FY2021 \nis expected to decline by only about 1%.7 This decline is not expected to impact solar projects \nowing to the must-run status provided to them by both state and central distribution companies. \nBecause of reduced power demand, it is the thermal capacity that has faced lower offtake while \nthere has been negligible impact on solar projects, particularly those that have PPAs with state \nand central distribution companies. \n \n8.  Project design. AEPL had secured or was in advanced stages to secure 2,407 MW of \nsolar PV generation PPAs as of 30 June 2020, of which 666 MW were operational; the remainder \nis expected to be operationalized by FY2022. (Confidential information redacted) PPAs for 1,935 \nMW are for terms of 25 years and have been acquired based on a competitive bidding process \nwith the lowest power tariff being the key winning criterion. PPAs for the balance 472 MW (for the \nbusiness plan up to FY2022) are with industrial customers with strong credit ratings and are of \nvarying tenors (5\u201325 years), with options to renew on mutually agreeable terms. AEPL will bid for \nnew projects based on rigorous project selection criteria that have been agreed upon between \nthe shareholders and AEPL. \n \n9.  The 666 MW of operational capacities were constructed on time and within budget, \ndemonstrating AEPL\u2019s strong execution capability. This successful performance is attributable to \nAEPL\u2019s single-point in-house engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) approach, which \nprovides AEPL with a unique edge in bidding, where it can control project costs and timelines \nwhile retaining any profits related solely to EPC activities. \n \n4  ADB. 2009.

The project also addresses some of the issues faced by women in the power sector in \nSouth Asia which result in their low levels of participation and them typically working in middle to \nlower level administrative positions. The major barriers to women\u2019s careers in the power sector \nhave been identified as lack of role models and networking support, limited fieldwork and training \nopportunities,  and  inadequate  facilities  and  policies  including  lack  of  separate  toilets,  safe \ntransportation, daycare and flexible work arrangements.8 \n \n11.  Investee and sponsor. AEPL is the holding company for the renewable energy projects \ndeveloped by AVPL in India. It also undertakes the entire EPC for the projects it owns. It has 226 \nfull-time employees. AEPL is sponsored by AVPL, which is owned by Vineet Mittal (Confidential \ninformation redacted) and Sindoor Mittal (Confidential information redacted). Vineet Mittal is the \nchair and managing director of AEPL and is primarily responsible for its overall strategy, including \nproject selection, procurement, and liaison with government agencies. Sindoor Mittal is AEPL\u2019s \nvice-chair and is responsible for AEPL\u2019s strategy and leadership development. Kishor Nair, who \nhas more than 30 years of business experience, leads project execution and implementation. \nSudhir Sehgal, who has more than 35 years of industry experience, leads project development, \ndesign, and engineering. The finance team has strong relationships with large domestic financial \ninstitutions, having raised more than $1 billion of project financing. A separate team has been put \nin  place  for  land  acquisition\u2014a  key  activity  in  solar  power  development\u2014with  extensive \nexperience in purchasing and leasing land. \n \n12.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.9 AEPL, its ultimate beneficial owners, and its \nmanagement do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk, as \nthere is no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other information related to them. ADB\u2019s \nreview of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering \nor terrorism financing. No tax integrity due diligence was required. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  renewable  energy \ngeneration capacity of 175 GW achieved by 2022,10 and (ii) share of nonfossil fuel-based electric \npower generation capacity increased to 40% by 2030 (footnote 8). \n \n14.  Outcome.11 The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to \nthe  domestic  grid  increased.  The  project  (in  aggregate  with  the  phase  1  projects  already \nsupported by ADB) will generate about 5,600 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per annum and will \ncontribute to avoiding 4.9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from 2024 onward.12 \nThe project will also boost local employment and contribute to the local economy through \ndomestic purchases. \n \n \n8  WePOWER. 2019.

The updated design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 Assuming 2,622 MW of total capacity will be operational by 2023 and applying India\u2019s electricity emission factor of \n878 tons of carbon dioxide per gigawatt-hour. On a standalone basis, for the proposed phase 2 projects, the \navoidance in carbon dioxide emissions works out to about 1.1 million tons starting from 2024.  \n ", "4 \n15.  Outputs.13 The outputs of the project (in aggregate with the phase 1 projects already \nsupported by ADB) will be (i) installed solar power capacity increased to 2,622 MW; (ii) local \nemployment generated; (iii) growth of local economy supported; (iv) gender equality in AEPL \nenhanced; and (v) gender equality in implementing corporate social responsibility enhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is fully aligned with \nADB's Energy Policy, which prioritizes support for renewable energy development (footnote 7). It \nstrongly relates to two of the five core specializations of ADB: infrastructure and environment. It \nis consistent with the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and \n(iii) tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability.14 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s operational goal of scaling up private \nsector development and private sector operations, including supporting private sector operations\u2019 \nlong-term cofinancing target where every $1 in financing is to be matched by $2.5 of long-term \ncofinancing. It will contribute to ADB\u2019s goal to provide climate finance of $80 billion cumulatively \nfrom 2019 to 2030. Total climate mitigation finance from ADB for the project (including the LEAP \ninvestment) is estimated to be $15.0 million. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which calls for higher efficiency and carbon mitigation through \npower generation from renewable sources.15 \n \n17.  Lessons from previous operations. The extended annual reviews of solar projects \npreviously financed by ADB in India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance of resource \nassessment, (ii) the risks associated with land acquisition, and (iii) the need for adequate power \nevacuation facilities. In addition, past ADB support for the solar sector point to the risks associated \nwith timely payments of receivables from the offtakers. Means to address, monitor, and mitigate \nthese risks have been suitably incorporated as part of the project\u2019s implementation arrangements \nand will be closely monitored by ADB as a key shareholder. \n \nD.

ADB and LEAP will each subscribe to the Indian rupee equivalent of $7.5 million (total \n$15.0 million) of compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) issued by AEPL on terms and \nconditions substantially the same as the phase 1 investment. (Confidential information redacted) \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s proposed phase 2 investment will add significant value to AEPL by providing it with \naccess to much needed growth equity - at a time when its planned capital raising plans have been \nsignificantly affected due to market disruptions caused by COVID-19. This will help the company \nsustain the momentum of implementation of its ongoing solar projects in line with its revised \nbusiness plan \u2013 despite the pandemic. Given ADB\u2019s anchor role in structuring the proposed equity \nraise, the investment will also help mobilize an additional $25 million of equity capital from existing \nshareholders. The successive rounds of support from ADB in two phases (in 2019 and through \nthe proposed phase 2) \u2013 along with ADB\u2019s active engagement in the operations of the company \nas a shareholder and Board member \u2013 will help improve corporate governance standards and \nboost investor confidence in AEPL \u2013 thus attracting other equity investors once markets stabilize. \nThe proposed phase 2 investment will also strengthen the company\u2019s safeguards standards \u2013 \nespecially in light of its upgraded environmental categorization \u2013 and ensure that its operations \ncontinue to be carried out by adopting high and internationally recognized environmental and \nsocial (E&S) standards. Lastly, through the proposed phase 2 investment, ADB has incorporated \na number of additional gender-related design elements, leading to an improved gender policy and \nan enhanced gender categorization from SGE to EGM. \n \nC.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  The investment is a general corporate finance transaction. The phase 1 investment was \nclassified category B for environment, involuntary resettlement (IR), and indigenous peoples (IP), \nbased on the potential impacts of AEPL\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio that would be \nsupported by ADB. As the company progresses with its expansion program and more details \n ", "6 \nabout the location and environmental risks have become available, it is likely that some projects \nand associated facilities, especially the large projects in its portfolio (300 MW or more), could be \nlocated in the proximity of sensitive receptors or could potentially impact environmentally sensitive \nareas or protected species. Therefore, ADB is taking a conservative and precautionary approach \nand has recategorized the phase 1 and phase 2 investments category A for environment. The \ncompany\u2019s ESMS also addresses potential category A projects and includes terms of reference \nfor the preparation of an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) to meet national \nand  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Potential  project  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  the  project \nenvironmental management plan. The categorization for IR and IP remains B. ADB will continue \nto oversee the categorization and ESIA process of future projects. \n \n32.  A corporate audit of AEPL\u2019s E&S policies and procedures, and an assessment of the \ncompany\u2019s past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), were conducted for the phase 1 investment by a \nqualified and experienced external expert in 2018. Findings and corrective actions of the ESMS \naudit were summarized in a corrective action plan (CAP), which was agreed with AEPL. As a \ncondition to ADB\u2019s phase 1 investment, the company improved and upgraded its ESMS to comply \nwith national laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and other applicable \nrequirements as indicated in the CAP. 16 Implementation of other agreed CAP actions are also \nunderway.  AEPL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  for  management  of  E&S  issues  has  also  been \nstrengthened (at the corporate as well as the project level) and is deemed satisfactory. \n \n33.  During the first year of the phase 1 investment, ADB has monitored AEPL\u2019s portfolio, the \nESMS, and CAP implementation. ADB has determined that good progress has been achieved by \nAEPL  over  FY2020-FY2021,  and  AEPL\u2019s  E&S  performance  is  considered  satisfactory. \nNonetheless, ADB and other shareholders have identified certain areas for continued emphasis \nand improvements (such as independent verification of ESMS implementation, and strengthening \nof the corporate E&S team with another qualified social specialist); an updated CAP, including \nsuch actions, has been agreed with AEPL and will be implemented.17 Requirements to implement \nthese will be included in the terms of ADB\u2019s new investment. ADB will continue to monitor the \nprogress on ESMS implementation and other agreed actions. \n \n34.  AEPL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.18 AEPL will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and \n(ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will follow \nADB requirements.19 \n \n35.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998),  AEPL  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as \nfollows: (i) adding a female member to its board for the first time, (ii) increasing the number of \n \n16 ADB. 2019.
