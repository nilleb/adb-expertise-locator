The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed administration of an equity investment of up to $7,500,000 in Indian rupee equivalent \nto be  provided  by the  Leading  Asia's  Private  Infrastructure Fund (LEAP)  for the  Avaada  Solar \nPhase 2 Project,1 and if the Board approves the proposed equity investment, I, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the  administration  of  the  LEAP  equity \ninvestment. \n \n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  German  Investment  Corporation  (DEG),  the \nNetherlands  Development  Finance  Company (FMO),  and  Proparco2 are shareholders  in  AEPL \nand support its business plan that was approved during the previous investment round (phase 1).3 \nThese shareholders now plan to invest a further $40.0 million in AEPL to support the new solar \nphotovoltaic (PV) projects under power purchase agreements (PPA) that AEPL has subsequently \nwon as part of its expansion plans (phase 2). The proposed investment will help AEPL to expand \nits solar operating generation capacity from 666 megawatts (MW) as of June 2020 to 2,622 MW \nby March 2023. The project will help the Government of India to meet its targets for nonfossil fuel-\nbased electric power generation and reduce India\u2019s emission intensity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  AEPL  is  promoted  by  Vineet  Mittal  (Confidential  information \nredacted) through Avaada Ventures Private Limited (AVPL or sponsor). In April 2019, ADB led an \ninvestment  of  $100.0  million  in  Indian  rupee  equivalent  (Confidential  information  redacted)  in \nAEPL  during  which  ADB,  DEG,  FMO  and  LEAP  invested  $25.0  million  each  in  Indian  rupee \nequivalent (footnote 3). (Confidential information redacted) In November 2019, AEPL raised an \nadditional $15.0 million of equity in Indian rupee equivalent (Confidential information redacted) \nfrom Proparco. As part of this phase 1 financing, the shareholders had also negotiated an option \nto invest an additional $40.0 million by second half 2020 (Confidential information redacted). The \nexisting shareholders propose to exercise this option to invest further equity in AEPL to support \nits phase 2 expansion. \n \nADB  has  prior  experience  of  working  with  Vineet  Mittal.  It  invested  $39  million  in  June \n4. \n2014 and $11 million in March 2016 in Welspun Renewables Energy Private Limited (WREPL), a \ncompany controlled by Welspun Energy Limited, which was cosponsored by Vineet Mittal and B. \nK.  Goenka.  WREPL  grew  to  become  India\u2019s  largest  solar  power  company,  with  1,140  MW  of \ncapacity, within 2 years of ADB\u2019s first investment. In 2016, ADB fully exited WREPL. AEPL was \nformed in 2017 as part of a demerger process from Welspun Energy Limited. \n \n5. \nAEPL has rapidly grown and, in less than 3 years since its inception in June 2017, has \nbecome  one  of  the  five  largest  solar  developers  in  India  in  terms  of  operational  and  under-\nconstruction capacity. (Confidential information redacted) AEPL approached ADB and the other \n\n \n\n1  Financing Partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  Proparco is a subsidiary of Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement focused on private sector development. \n3  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment \nand  Administration of  Equity  Investment to  Avaada  Energy Private  Limited  for the  Avaada  Solar  Project  in  India. \nManila. \n\n\fexisting shareholders to exercise their option to invest another $40.0 million to support this growth. \nAEPL has also set an ambitious plan to reach about 4 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by \nFY2024.  It  had  initiated  an  equity  issuance  process  to  support  its  growth  plan,  however,  this \nprocess has been delayed because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n \n6. \nCOVID-19  has  had  the  following  impacts  on  AEPL,  each  of  which  is  expected  to  be \ntemporary:  (i)  construction  delays  for  some  of  AEPL\u2019s  projects;  (ii)  increased  working  capital; \n(iii) delayed release of excess equity from its projects where more than the required equity capital \nwas invested because of unforeseen delays in raising debt, and to finance payment of taxes and \nduties; (iv) a delay in the sale of 26% shareholding in certain solar PV projects tied to commercial \nand industrial customers; and (v) short-term liquidity constraints affecting the sponsor\u2019s ability to \ninvest  any  further  capital  in  AEPL.  However,  the  sponsor  has  already  invested  a  substantial \namount of equity capital in the company, and thus remains highly committed to it. These impacts \nhave already been factored in the revised business plan for AEPL. \n \n7. \nThe project provides ADB with an opportunity to further its commitment to scale up clean \nenergy  financing4 through  an  existing  client  with  an  established  execution  track  record.  ADB\u2019s \ninitiative will support the Government of India\u2019s target to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy \ngeneration  capacity  by  2022,  of  which  100  GW  is  expected  to  be  from  solar  power. 5  The \ngovernment  expects  the  private  sector  to  lead  the  solar  capacity  addition.  As  of  May  2020, \noperational  utility-scale  solar  generation  capacity  in  India  was  about  34.9  GW.  While  power \ndemand  fell  by  22.3%  in  April  2020  because  of  the  COVID-19-related  national  lockdown \nannounced in March 2020,6 the decline moderated to 14.9% in May and 9.7% in June 2020. This \ndisruption is expected to be temporary and, as per a 2020 report from ICRA Limited (an Indian \nratings agency and a Moody\u2019s Investors Service company), the annual power demand for FY2021 \nis expected to decline by only about 1%.7 This decline is not expected to impact solar projects \nowing to the must-run status provided to them by both state and central distribution companies. \nBecause of reduced power demand, it is the thermal capacity that has faced lower offtake while \nthere has been negligible impact on solar projects, particularly those that have PPAs with state \nand central distribution companies. \n \n8. \nProject design. AEPL had secured or was in advanced stages to secure 2,407 MW of \nsolar PV generation PPAs as of 30 June 2020, of which 666 MW were operational; the remainder \nis expected to be operationalized by FY2022. (Confidential information redacted) PPAs for 1,935 \nMW are for terms of 25 years and have been acquired based on a competitive bidding process \nwith the lowest power tariff being the key winning criterion. PPAs for the balance 472 MW (for the \nbusiness plan up to FY2022) are with industrial customers with strong credit ratings and are of \nvarying tenors (5\u201325 years), with options to renew on mutually agreeable terms. AEPL will bid for \nnew projects based on rigorous project selection criteria that have been agreed upon between \nthe shareholders and AEPL. \n \n9. \nThe  666  MW  of  operational  capacities  were  constructed  on  time  and  within  budget, \ndemonstrating AEPL\u2019s strong execution capability. This successful performance is attributable to \nAEPL\u2019s single-point in-house engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) approach, which \nprovides  AEPL  with  a  unique  edge  in bidding,  where  it can  control  project  costs  and timelines \nwhile retaining any profits related solely to EPC activities. \n\n \n4  ADB. 2009.

The major barriers to women\u2019s careers in the power sector \nhave been identified as lack of role models and networking support, limited fieldwork and training \nopportunities,  and  inadequate  facilities  and  policies  including  lack  of  separate  toilets,  safe \ntransportation, daycare and flexible work arrangements.8 \n \nInvestee and sponsor. AEPL is the holding company for the renewable energy projects \n11. \ndeveloped by AVPL in India. It also undertakes the entire EPC for the projects it owns. It has 226 \nfull-time employees. AEPL is sponsored by AVPL, which is owned by Vineet Mittal (Confidential \ninformation redacted) and Sindoor Mittal (Confidential information redacted). Vineet Mittal is the \nchair and managing director of AEPL and is primarily responsible for its overall strategy, including \nproject selection, procurement, and liaison with government agencies. Sindoor Mittal is AEPL\u2019s \nvice-chair and is responsible for AEPL\u2019s strategy and leadership development.

ADB\u2019s \nreview of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering \nor terrorism financing. No tax integrity due diligence was required. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  renewable  energy \ngeneration capacity of 175 GW achieved by 2022,10 and (ii) share of nonfossil fuel-based electric \npower generation capacity increased to 40% by 2030 (footnote 8). \n \nOutcome.11 The project  will  have the following  outcome:  renewable  power  delivered to \n14. \nthe  domestic  grid  increased.  The  project  (in  aggregate  with  the  phase  1  projects  already \nsupported by ADB) will generate about 5,600 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per annum and will \ncontribute to avoiding 4.9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from 2024 onward.12 \nThe  project  will  also  boost  local  employment  and  contribute  to  the  local  economy  through \ndomestic purchases. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n\n \n\n8  WePOWER.  2019.

The updated design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n12 Assuming 2,622 MW of total capacity will be operational by 2023 and applying India\u2019s electricity emission factor of \n878  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  per  gigawatt-hour.  On  a  standalone  basis,  for  the  proposed  phase  2  projects,  the \navoidance in carbon dioxide emissions works out to about 1.1 million tons starting from 2024.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nOutputs.13 The  outputs  of  the  project  (in  aggregate  with  the  phase  1  projects  already \n15. \nsupported  by  ADB)  will  be  (i)  installed  solar  power  capacity  increased  to  2,622  MW;  (ii)  local \nemployment  generated;  (iii)  growth  of  local  economy  supported;  (iv)  gender  equality  in  AEPL \nenhanced; and (v) gender equality in implementing corporate social responsibility enhanced. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is fully aligned with \nADB's Energy Policy, which prioritizes support for renewable energy development (footnote 7). It \nstrongly relates to two of the five core specializations of ADB: infrastructure and environment. It \nis  consistent  with  the  following  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  and \n(iii) tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability.14 It  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  goal  of  scaling  up  private \nsector development and private sector operations, including supporting private sector operations\u2019 \nlong-term cofinancing target where every $1 in financing is to be matched by $2.5 of long-term \ncofinancing. It will contribute to ADB\u2019s goal to provide climate finance of $80 billion cumulatively \nfrom 2019 to 2030. Total climate mitigation finance from ADB for the project (including the LEAP \ninvestment) is estimated to be $15.0 million. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  which  calls  for  higher  efficiency  and  carbon  mitigation  through \npower generation from renewable sources.15 \n \n17. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  extended  annual  reviews  of  solar  projects \npreviously financed by ADB in India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance of resource \nassessment, (ii) the risks associated with land acquisition, and (iii) the need for adequate power \nevacuation facilities. In addition, past ADB support for the solar sector point to the risks associated \nwith timely payments of receivables from the offtakers. Means to address, monitor, and mitigate \nthese risks have been suitably incorporated as part of the project\u2019s implementation arrangements \nand will be closely monitored by ADB as a key shareholder. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n19. \n \nE. \n \n20. \n \nF. \n \n21. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n13 The output indicators are inclusive of ADB\u2019s phase 1 investment (footnote 14). \n14 ADB.  2018.

(Confidential information redacted) \n \nB. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s proposed phase 2 investment will add significant value to AEPL by providing it with \naccess to much needed growth equity - at a time when its planned capital raising plans have been \nsignificantly affected due to market disruptions caused by COVID-19. This will help the company \nsustain  the  momentum  of  implementation  of  its  ongoing  solar  projects  in  line  with  its  revised \nbusiness plan \u2013 despite the pandemic. Given ADB\u2019s anchor role in structuring the proposed equity \nraise, the investment will also help mobilize an additional $25 million of equity capital from existing \nshareholders. The successive rounds of support from ADB in two phases (in 2019 and through \nthe proposed phase 2) \u2013 along with ADB\u2019s active engagement in the operations of the company \nas a shareholder and Board member  \u2013 will help improve corporate governance standards and \nboost investor confidence in AEPL \u2013 thus attracting other equity investors once markets stabilize. \nThe  proposed  phase  2  investment  will  also strengthen the  company\u2019s safeguards  standards  \u2013 \nespecially in light of its upgraded environmental categorization \u2013 and ensure that its operations \ncontinue  to  be  carried  out  by  adopting  high  and  internationally  recognized  environmental  and \nsocial (E&S) standards. Lastly, through the proposed phase 2 investment, ADB has incorporated \na number of additional gender-related design elements, leading to an improved gender policy and \nan enhanced gender categorization from SGE to EGM. \n \nC. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe investment is a general corporate finance transaction. The phase 1 investment was \nclassified category B for environment, involuntary resettlement (IR), and indigenous peoples (IP), \nbased  on  the  potential  impacts  of  AEPL\u2019s  existing  and  likely  future  portfolio  that  would  be \nsupported  by  ADB.  As  the  company  progresses  with  its  expansion  program  and  more  details \n\n \n\n\fabout the location and environmental risks have become available, it is likely that some projects \nand associated facilities, especially the large projects in its portfolio (300 MW or more), could be \nlocated in the proximity of sensitive receptors or could potentially impact environmentally sensitive \nareas or protected species. Therefore, ADB is taking a conservative and precautionary approach \nand has recategorized the phase 1 and phase 2 investments category A for environment. The \ncompany\u2019s ESMS also addresses potential category A projects and includes terms of reference \nfor the preparation of an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) to meet national \nand  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Potential  project  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  the  project \nenvironmental management plan. The categorization for IR and IP remains B. ADB will continue \nto oversee the categorization and ESIA process of future projects. \n \n32. \nA  corporate  audit  of  AEPL\u2019s  E&S  policies  and  procedures,  and  an  assessment  of  the \ncompany\u2019s past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  were  conducted  for  the  phase  1  investment  by  a \nqualified and experienced external expert in 2018. Findings and corrective actions of the ESMS \naudit  were  summarized  in  a  corrective  action  plan  (CAP),  which  was  agreed  with  AEPL.  As  a \ncondition to ADB\u2019s phase 1 investment, the company improved and upgraded its ESMS to comply \nwith  national  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  other  applicable \nrequirements as indicated in the CAP. 16 Implementation of other agreed CAP actions are also \nunderway.  AEPL\u2019s  institutional  capacity  for  management  of  E&S  issues  has  also  been \nstrengthened (at the corporate as well as the project level) and is deemed satisfactory. \n \n33. \nDuring the first year of the phase 1 investment, ADB has monitored AEPL\u2019s portfolio, the \nESMS, and CAP implementation. ADB has determined that good progress has been achieved by \nAEPL  over  FY2020-FY2021,  and  AEPL\u2019s  E&S  performance  is  considered  satisfactory. \nNonetheless, ADB and other shareholders have identified certain areas for continued emphasis \nand improvements (such as independent verification of ESMS implementation, and strengthening \nof the corporate E&S team with another qualified social specialist); an updated CAP, including \nsuch actions, has been agreed with AEPL and will be implemented.17 Requirements to implement \nthese will be included in the terms of ADB\u2019s new investment.  ADB will continue to monitor the \nprogress on ESMS implementation and other agreed actions. \n \nAEPL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \n34. \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.18 AEPL will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and \n(ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will follow \nADB requirements.19 \n \n35. \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998),  AEPL  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities.
