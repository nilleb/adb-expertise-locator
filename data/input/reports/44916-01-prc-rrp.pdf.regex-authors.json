I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to CNY162.5 million1 in the Sino-Green Climate Investment Fund (SCIF) \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  The SCIF was recommended to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by the PRC\u2019s \nNational Development and Reform Commission in support of their dual goals of mobilizing \nprivate sector finance to combat climate change and developing the PRC\u2019s onshore private \nequity  fund  market.  The  fund  seeks  to  promote  resource  conservation  and  environmental \nprotection by investing in companies and projects2 in sectors related to climate change in the \nPRC, and to provide fund investors with stable, long-term capital gains. The targeted fund size \nwill be CNY1,300 million, with a first closing of about CNY650 million. The second and final \nclosing will occur 1 year after the first closing.  \n \n3.  The fund will be established in Tianjin Municipality as a foreign-invested venture capital \ninvestment  enterprise  (FIVCE).  It  will  be  managed  by  the  Tianjin  New  Cleansource  Fund \nManagement Company (the fund manager, the same legal entity as the sponsor).  \n \n4.  Onshore private equity fund. The SCIF will be one of the earliest onshore private \nequity funds exclusively targeting sectors related to climate change in the PRC, and ADB\u2019s first \ninvestment  in  a  CNY  fund.  Onshore  private  equity  funds  provide  the  critical  function  of \nchanneling domestic savings into productive investments. Through its investment in the SCIF, \nADB will help to introduce international best practices and set high governance and safeguard \nstandards  in  this  nascent  industry.  The  success  of  the  SCIF  will  demonstrate  a  practical \nmodality  for  mobilizing  and  integrating  international  and  domestic  financial  resources  and \nintellectual capital to promote investment in climate change related businesses and projects. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n5.  The PRC is one of the largest energy consuming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting \ncountries in the world. Its status as such has led to increasing concern about energy security \nand growing public demand for reducing energy costs and addressing climate change in the \ncountry. This in turn has resulted in a convergence of social, political, economic, environmental, \nand  entrepreneurial  forces  that  is  collectively  driving  the  creation  of  vast  opportunities  for \nbusinesses to benefit as early movers in climate change and environmental technologies and to \ncapitalize on the substantial policy support that exists in the PRC for the country to transition to \nlow-carbon  and  climate-resilient  growth.  Equity  investment  is  in  high  demand  to  finance \nsustainable growth of those companies focusing on improving energy efficiency, developing \nrenewable energy, conserving resources, abating pollution, and reducing carbon dioxide (CO ) \n2\nand other GHG emissions.    \n \n6.  Investment  strategy  and  selection  criteria.  The  fund  is  well  positioned  to  take \nadvantage of the investment opportunities being created in sectors related to climate change. \n                                                \n1 CNY financing funded from the ADB\u2019s offshore CNY bond proceeds. \n2 Investments in projects will be limited to a maximum of 10% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital. \n ", "2 \n \nThe  SCIF  will  primarily  invest  in  companies  at  the  expansion  stage  in  energy  efficiency, \nrenewable  energy,  resource  recycling  and  conservation,  and  environment  protection.  The \nSCIF\u2019s portfolio companies are expected to have (i) attained preliminary success in technology \nor commercial operations; (ii) exhibited strong business fundamentals and sustainable growth \ntrends;  (iii)  committed  to  fully  meet  domestic  environmental  and  social  regulations  and \nrequirements, and to comply with all applicable safeguard and social policies of ADB as well as \nthe  anti-money  laundering  and  know-your-client  requirements;  and  (iv)  agreed  on  a  clear \nbusiness development strategy and exit path with the fund manager. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n7.  SCIF has two anchor investors in the first closing, ZTE Energy (ZEN) and Bank of China \nGroup Investment Limited (BOCGI). ZEN was established in 2007 in Beijing with registered \ncapital of CNY1.29 billion. It makes direct and controlling investments in projects designed to \nproduce  renewable  energy,  enhance  energy  productivity  through  energy  management \ncontracting services, and protect the environment. BOCGI was incorporated in Hong Kong, \nChina  in  1984,  and  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Bank  of  China.  It  is  a  leading \nprofessional investment management company and a pioneer private equity investor in the \ngreater  PRC  region.  During  the  past  26  years,  BOCGI  has  invested  in  numerous  large \ninfrastructure projects in Hong Kong, China; Macau, China; mainland PRC; and overseas.  \n2.  Management \n8.  The  fund  manager  will  be  responsible  for  originating,  structuring,  and  negotiating \ntransactions;  making  recommendations  to  the  investment  committee  with  regard  to  the \nacquisition  and  disposition  of  portfolio  investments;  monitoring  portfolio  investments;  and \nassisting  in  the  administration  of  capital  calls  and  distributions  to  investors,  and  investor \nreporting.  \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n9.  Corporate  governance.  The  fund  will  establish  an  advisory  board  consisting  of \nrepresentatives from each significant investors including ADB. \n10.  A dedicated and independent custodian account will be set up with a creditworthy local \nbank to handle cash transactions and asset trusteeship for the SCIF to ensure fund security and \ntransparency.  \n \n11.  Investment process. The fund\u2019s investment process will comprise six cascading steps: \n(i)  project  initiation,  (ii)  preliminary  due  diligence,  (iii)  comprehensive  due  diligence  and \nevaluation,  (iv)  investment decision-making  and  operations, (v)  value-addition  services  and \nperformance monitoring, and (vi) divestment. To achieve the strategic goals of the SCIF, the \nfund manager will adopt international best practices to screen, structure, analyze, execute, and \nmonitor the SCIF\u2019s investments. The fund manager will regularly conduct comprehensive sector, \nmarket, and policy analyses to support smooth and effective fund operations. A high priority will \nbe  placed  on  risk  identification  and  mitigation,  and  on  balancing  risks  against  anticipated \nreturns.   \n \n12.  Investment committee. The fund will establish an investment committee consisting of \nfive members. The investment committee will be responsible for updating the SCIF\u2019s investment \nstrategies, priorities, policies, and its investment management systems, covering information ", "3 \ncollection  and  analysis, financial  valuation,  risk  identification  and  control,  and  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  investment  committee  will  review  and  make  decisions  on \ninvestment and divestment proposals in accordance with the SCIF policies and procedures.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n \n13.  It is proposed that ADB make an equity investment of up to CNY162.5 million in the \nSCIF, not exceeding 25% of the total commitments to the SCIF and not resulting in ADB being \nthe single largest investor in the SCIF. \n \nB.  Expected Returns  \n \n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Exit Strategy  \n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements   \n  \n14.  ADB will review all the SCIF reports on an ongoing basis, along with information on \nportfolio valuation and performance of individual portfolio companies. ADB will hold a seat on \nthe SCIF\u2019s advisory board and will be involved in discussions and decisions related to corporate \ngovernance, adjustment of investment strategies, and conflicts of interest.  \n \n15.  The SCIF will retain a reputable accounting firm to conduct annual audits of its financial \nstatus and provide investors with four unaudited quarterly reports and one audited annual \nfinancial report. The fund will also submit an annual report on its environmental and social \nperformance. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  Catalyzing  resource  mobilization  for  climate  change  investments.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in one of the first onshore private equity funds targeting sectors related to climate \nchange will help to increase low-carbon financing in the PRC by demonstrating practical ways to \nachieve  a  decent  risk\u2013return  balance.  The  associated  financing  activities  of  the  portfolio \ncompanies, such as long-term debt borrowing, corporate bond issuing, mergers and acquisition, \ncarbon credit trading, risk insuring and guaranteeing, currency exchanging and hedging, asset \nrestructuring, and initial public offerings, will contribute to broaden and deepen the capital \nmarkets in the region.  \n    \n17.  Introducing  international  best  practice.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  design, \nestablishment, and operations of the SCIF will ensure that the SCIF and its portfolio companies \ncomply with the highest standard of governance and social and environmental safeguards. \nGood  governance  will  increase  investor  protection  and  inspire  investor  confidence.  High \nsafeguard standards will mitigate the risks of any possible social and environmental damages \n ", "4 \n \nand ultimately benefit both the SCIF and its investees. By introducing international best practice \nto the SCIF, ADB\u2019s investment will have wider demonstration effects on the nascent industry of \nonshore private equity in the PRC.3  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n.(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n18.  ADB\u2019s investment in and assistance to the proposed climate change private equity fund \ncan deliver a significant development impact as summarized in the design and monitoring \nframework. Over the long run, the ADB investment will help reduce GHG emissions, mitigate \nclimate change effects, and enhance national energy efficiency, diversity and security through (i) \nmobilizing  and  utilizing  market  instruments  and  mechanisms  to  leverage  more  financial \nresources and technical support to expedite growth of companies concentrating on climate \nchange businesses; (ii) facilitating private equity market development with a focus on clean \nenergy  and  environmental  protection  industries;  (iii)  stimulating  financial  and  engineering \ninnovations  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  develop  renewable  energy,  conserve  natural \nresources, and protect the environment; and (iv) generating demonstration effects in both areas \nof clean technology deployment and private equity fund operations. Since the poor are most \nvulnerable to energy insecurity and the adverse effects of climate change in terms of direct and \ninduced damages on their productivity, income opportunities, and health, this investment will \ncontribute in reducing poverty and spurring environmentally friendly socioeconomic growth.   \n \n2.  Outcome \n19.  The outcome of ADB\u2019s investment will be mainly reflected in the increased flows of \nfunding and expertise mobilized to support sustainable growth of companies and projects in \nsectors related to climate change in the PRC. It will help demonstrate that it is viable for private \nequity funds to invest profitably in climate change companies and projects that will generate \npositive environmental and social externalities while harvesting decent financial returns. Most of \nthe SCIF\u2019s portfolio companies will adopt international standards for financial reporting and \ncorporate governance that are necessary for initial public offering in a regional stock market.  \n \n3.  Outputs  \n20.  The key outputs of the proposed ADB investment will be the establishment of the SCIF \nfor the purpose of supporting companies and projects in sectors related to climate change in the \nPRC.  The  governance  structure,  decision  making  procedures,  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS), and risk management systems of the SCIF shall meet ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. The fund manager will identify, screen, and evaluate investment opportunities \nand provide ongoing management advice and value-addition services to the SCIF\u2019s portfolio \ncompanies.  \n                                                \n3  Value Added by ADB Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) contains further          \ndiscussion on ADB\u2019s value addition. ", "5 \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n21.  The  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  fundamental  goals  of  promoting  inclusive \neconomic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner and eliminating poverty in \nAsia and the Pacific. In Strategy 2020,4 ADB has designated energy and financial market \ndevelopment as two core operational sectors; and achieving environmental sustainability as one \nof  three  strategic  priorities,  aiming  at  (i)  mitigating  climate  change  through  facilitating  the \ntransition  of  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  toward  low-carbon  economies;  and \n(ii) achieving  regional  energy  security  and  diversity  through  adopting  clean  technologies, \nimproving  energy  efficiency,  and  scaling  up  clean  energy  development.  Recognizing  the \nimportance of the private sector in realizing these objectives, Strategy 2020 has also highlighted \nthe greater roles of the private sector in this endeavor.   \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy,5 2008\u20132010 and country operations business plan,6 \n2011\u20132013 for the PRC have emphasized balanced and sustainable growth with more efficient \nuses of resources and more stringent protection of the environment. The investment supports \nimplementation  of  the  PRC\u2019s  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  highlights  resource \nconservation  and  environmental  protection  and  attaches  top  priority  to  improving  energy \nefficiency, reducing pollution emissions, and developing cleaner and renewable energy, while \nspecifically requiring that financial assistance from international financial institutions be used for \nresource conservation, environmental protection, and infrastructure development. \n   \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n23.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy7 of 2009 reiterates the essential roles of the private sector in \nimproving access to affordable and reliable energy sources and in securing energy market \nefficiency  and  competitiveness  in  the  region.  It  encourages  more  proactive  private  sector \nparticipation and public\u2013private partnership to increase investable resources and to transfer \ncleaner technologies to the energy sector in ADB\u2019s DMCs. ADB has committed to double its \ninvestments in clean energy projects to $2 billion per year by 2013. ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) has similarly corroborated the needs for reinforcing poverty alleviation, mainstreaming \nenvironmental protection, and strengthening partnerships with relevant stakeholders including \nprivate sector entities. ADB\u2019s realigned strategic agenda on fighting climate change8 states that \nADB  will  move  upstream  in  the  technology  development  process,  collaborating  with \ngovernments, venture and private equity funds, and other partners to facilitate transferring and \ndeploying clean energy technologies. The investment is clearly aligned with ADB\u2019s energy, \nenvironment, and climate change policies. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n24.  ADB has been working for nearly a decade to promote climate change financing and to \nsupport private equity market development in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The lesson drawn from previous \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action. Manila. \n ", "6 \n \ninvestments is that incubating funds takes time and effort. As a result, ADB should focus on \nselecting those fund managers that are most likely to succeed in fundraising and investment, \nbut may fall short without ADB. Relatively few private equity funds focus on climate change \nbusinesses in ADB\u2019s DMCs, and it is much rarer in the case of onshore funds. When ADB \nintends to develop a new asset class, where few managers exist and ADB does not have the \nluxury to choose among established managers, it is appropriate for ADB to work with a first-time \nfund manager. Nevertheless, a great deal of time and effort is needed to ensure the proper \nsetup, successful fundraising, and prudent investments of a first-time fund. ADB\u2019s consistent \ncommitment and support will be critical to the ultimate success of the new asset class it seeks to \npromote.   \n \n25.  Another  lesson  learned  is  that  it  would  be  useful  to  supplement  strong  legal \ndocumentation  with  capacity  building  to  ensure  that  all  investee  funds  meet  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements. ADB\u2019s legal documentation makes submitting \na compliant ESMS a condition precedent for drawdown. ADB is also implementing technical \nassistance9 to provide ESMS training to investee funds that have not submitted a compliant \nESMS to ADB. These measures ensure that the investee funds have both the incentive and \ncapacity to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements.  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards   \n26.  ADB\u2019s investment in the SCIF has been classified category FI (financial intermediary) \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  SCIF  will  be  required  to  establish, \nmaintain, and implement an appropriate ESMS to ensure that the SCIF\u2019s investments are in \ncompliance with applicable national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s requirement prescribed in \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  SCIF  will  also  be  required  to  comply  with  the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. ADB will coordinate with fund \nmanager to ensure that the ESMS is adopted prior to disbursement for the first investment, and \nguide the fund manager in environmental and social safeguards due diligence, monitoring, and \nreporting10.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n27.  The fund manager was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and Policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the fund manager to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures \nand  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing \ncorruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation \nincludes  appropriate  anticorruption  provisions  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. The investment documentation between ADB and the fund will further allow \nADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2010.

Investment Limitations \n(The information in this section is withheld based on exception 9 in paragraph 126 of the PCP.) \n \nD.  Assurances \n29.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (The \nCharter),11 no funding will be disbursed if the Government of the PRC objects to the proposed \nfinancing to the SCIF.  \n \n30.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by the Board of Directors, ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n31.
