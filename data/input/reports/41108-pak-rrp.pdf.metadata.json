No adverse environmental impact was identified.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  expected \nfrom implementation of the Program. \n \nThe  growth  and  development  of  well-functioning  capital  markets, \nparticularly  equity  and  long-term  debt  (bonds),  generates  significant \nbenefits.  Capital  markets  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources \nand  their  efficient  allocation  into  productive  investments  by  providing \nefficient  savings  vehicles \ninvestors  and \nfor  retail  and \ndiversifying funding sources for enterprises. Diversification also makes the \ncorporate  and  financial  sectors  more  robust  to  shocks,  which  enhances \nthe sustainability of economic development.  \n \nPakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since the 1990s. \nThe  enabling  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  the  capital \nmarket has been strengthened; the financial health of most ailing financial \ninstitutions restored; a large number of state-owned institutions have been \nprivatized;  and  competition \ninvigorated.  However,  domestic  capital \nmarkets  do  not  yet  play  a  significant  role  in  financial  intermediation  and \nresource mobilization.  \n \nBuilding on achievements thus far, the Government is planning to launch a \nsecond  generation  of  capital  market  reforms  to  facilitate  mobilization  of \nfinancial resources for productive investment and employment generation. \nThese reforms also aim at a balanced development of the financial sector, \nwhich  will  reduce  systemic  vulnerabilities  in  a  bank-dominated  financial \nsystem.  \n\ninstitutional \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nThe  Government  plans  to  put  special  emphasis  on  strengthening  the \nenabling  environment  for  pension  funds  and  other  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions,  given  the  strong  causal  relationship  between  the  level  of \ndevelopment  of  institutional  investors  and  the  deepening  of  capital \nmarkets. While limited supply of suitable assets, including corporate equity \nand  debt,  clearly  hampers  the  development  of  institutional  investors,  the \nrelative  underdevelopment  of  contractual  savings  schemes  offered  by \ninstitutional investors limits the demand for securities.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  financial  sector \nreforms  in  Pakistan  since  mid-1990s  through  two  significant  programs. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  for  its  renewed  capital \nmarket  development  initiative  in  continuation  of  past  assistance.  A  quick-\ndisbursing  program  will  help  leverage  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms \nand provide necessary financial resources. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  through  a \nmore efficient and balanced financial system. The Program\u2019s outcome will \nbe  increased  resource  mobilization  through  the  capital  markets  for \nproductive  investment  and  employment  generation  by  providing  efficient \nsavings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors,  and  diversified \nfunding  sources  for  enterprises.  Such  diversification  will  also  make  the \ncorporate and financial sectors more resilient to shocks.  \n \nThe  Program  will  (i)  support  the  development  of  institutional  investors  to \nfacilitate  long-term  capital  formation  and  increase  the  demand  for \nsecurities, (ii) improve the efficiency of securities markets to increase the \nsupply  of  corporate  securities  and  optimize  the  allocation  of  financial \nresources into productive investment, and (iii) strengthen the governance \nof capital markets to improve market transparency and protect investors. \n \nADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  second  generation  of  capital  market \nreforms  under  the  Program  by  providing  a  program  loan  of  $400  million \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of ADB under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge  of  0.75%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n \nThe Program will be completed in 2 years, by 30 June 2009. The loan will \nbe  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $200  million  will  be \nreleased  following  satisfaction  of  the  first  tranche  release  conditions  and \nafter loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $200 million is expected to \nbe  released  between  6  and  18  months  after  release  of  the  first  tranche \nsubject to the Government meeting the conditions specified for its release. \n \nMinistry of Finance. \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nThe Government will establish a Program Coordination Unit in the Ministry \nof Finance to coordinate program implementation. The unit will cooperate \nclosely  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  and \nMinistry of Privatization, which will act as the implementing agencies. \n \n\nfor  securities \n\nthe  private  sector  and \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds  generated  by \nthe  loan  are  used  to  (i)  support  the  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \nimplemented under the Program, and (ii) finance expenditures for  general \ndevelopment purposes of the country. \n \nThe  Program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for \nproductive  investment  and  employment  generation  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment  of  corporate  bond  and  equity  capital  markets  in  Pakistan. It \nwill help to ensure balanced development of the financial sector, which will \nreduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system.  \n \nThe policy and regulatory reforms  supported under the Program will help \nto significantly increase the number of corporate bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of financial \nresources for long-term private sector investment, including infrastructure \ninvestment.  Further,  the  reforms  will  facilitate  capital  mobilization  through \nstrengthening  and  increasing  contractual  savings.  This  is  beneficial  not \nonly from a social security point of view; it will also increase and stabilize \nthe \nissued  by \nthe  demand \nGovernment. \n \nThe  Program  will  enhance  market  efficiency  and  transparency,  and \nimprove  investor  protection  by  strengthening  governance  of  the  capital \nmarket.  Further,  the  program-supported  reforms  will  help  fight  corruption \nby (i) strengthening the independence, accountability, and transparency of \nthe regulatory body in charge of securities markets; and (ii) increasing the \ntransparency  of  state-owned  enterprise  privatization  through  a  capital \nmarket oriented privatization policy. \n \nThe Program will increase the competitiveness of financial groups and the \neffectiveness  of  financial  sector  regulation  and  supervision  in  line  with \ninternational best practices, which will in turn reduce systemic risks.  \n \nThe  capital  market-oriented  privatization  approach  supported  under  the \nProgram  will  also  (i)  help  increase  budget  revenues,  since  investors  will \ntend  to  pay  more  for  shares  if  an  individual  offer  is  embedded  in  a \ntransparent  and  credible  overall  privatization  strategy;  (ii)  support  capital \nmarket  development  by \nthe \nperformance of enterprises by infusing greater market discipline amongst \ncompanies. \n \nMacroeconomic  stability  is  essential  for  financial  sector  development. \nMacroeconomic risks are mitigated by prudent fiscal and monetary policies \nand  high  expected  economic  growth  rates.  Pakistan  has  made  good \nprogress on these fronts in recent years. Moving forward, the Program has \n\nliquidity;  and  (iii) \n\nincreasing \n\nimprove \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nto  assume  that  (i)  Pakistan  will  not  suffer  from  any  adverse  geopolitical \nchanges  affecting  its  external  and  internal  stability,  and  (ii)  that  the \nsuccessive Governments will remain strongly committed to capital market \nreforms.  The  presidential  elections  scheduled  for  late  2007  may  result  in \npolicy changes in some areas. However, economic policies are unlikely to \nbe  fundamentally  changed,  given  the  high  degree  of  continuity  in \neconomic  policy  making  in  Pakistan  over  the  last  decade  and  the  broad \nconsensus for economic reforms, including financial sector reform. \n \nAnother risk is that draft legislation will be enacted with substantial delays \nand/or  may  not  be  in  line  with  international  best  practice  due  to  vested \ninterest  and  lack  of  understanding  by  lawmakers.  To  minimize  this  risk, \nlegislative  changes  related  to  the  Program  were  drafted  during  program \npreparation  or  will  be  drafted  under  the  TA  to  ensure  quality  of  the \nlegislation.  Further,  TA  will  be  provided  to  support  the  Government  in \nundertaking and sustaining stakeholder consultations. \n \nGood  regulatory  governance  cannot  be  sustained  without  good  public \nsector  governance  in  general.  The  latter  includes  effective  measures  to \nreduce  corruption,  a  sound  approach  to  competition  policies,  effective \nlegal  and  judicial  systems,  and  an  arm\u2019s-length  approach  to  government \nownership.  A  successful  continuation  of  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption \nand private sector development policies is therefore a critical pre-condition \nfor reaching the Program\u2019s objectives. \n \nThe accompanying TA for $1,000,000 will help the Government implement \nthe  reforms  under  the  Program.  The  TA  will  (i)  raise  professional \nstandards among market participants by supporting the Securities Institute \nof  Pakistan,  (ii)  strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \ninstitutional  investors,  and  (iii)  enhance  the  strategic  planning  capacity  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Privatization.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Second  Generation  of  Capital  Market  Reform \nProgram (the Program). The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) grant \nfor  Supporting  the  Second  Generation  of  Capital  Market  Reform  Program  and,  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. The design and monitoring framework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n\n2. \nThe Pakistan economy grew strongly over the past 4 years, at an average rate of 6.5%. \nPrivate  consumption,  boosted  by  rapid  expansion  in  consumer  credit  and  higher  worker\u2019s \nremittances,  was  a  lead  contributor  to  economic  growth.  The  rise  of  investment  spending  to \n20%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  supported  by  improved  business  confidence  and \nincreasing  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  also  contributed.  However,  national  savings \ndeclined  due  to  rising  consumer  demand,  negative  real  interest  rates  on  bank  deposits,  and \nscarcity  of  alternative  savings  vehicles.  Strong  macroeconomic  policies,  high  GDP  growth, \nincreases in pro-poor spending, and burgeoning workers\u2019 remittances all contributed to a steep \ndecline in the incidence of poverty and the unemployment rate. Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, the \nGovernment  has  pursued  a  pro-growth  fiscal  policy.  Development  outlays  have  risen  sharply. \nSpending in pro-poor sectors increased from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 5.6% the \nfollowing year. Alongside this, unplanned spending on relief and reconstruction in areas affected \nby  the  devastating  October  2005  earthquake  also  contributed  to  an  increase  in  public \nexpenditures. \n\n3. \nStrong  demand  for  goods  and  services  has  outstripped  supply  and  generated \ninflationary pressures. However, after peaking in 2005 at above 11%, annual inflation declined \nto  6.6%  in  January  2007  as  a  result  of  tighter  monetary  policy.  The  exchange  rate  of  the \nPakistan  rupee  was  kept  at  parity  with  the  US  dollar.  With  higher  domestic  inflation,  the  real \nexchange  rate  has,  therefore,  increased.  This,  together  with  strong  domestic  demand, \ncontributed  to  a  significant  deterioration  in  the  current  account  of  the  balance  of  payments.  In \nFY2006, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) more than tripled to $5.7 billion \nor 4.4% of GDP. The deficit was mainly financed through foreign direct investment inflows and \nconcessional  loans  from  multilateral  development  agencies.  The  current  account  deficit \ncontinued  to  widen  in  FY2007.  This  development  has  provided  strong  incentives  for  the \nthe \nGovernment \ncompetitiveness  of  exports  and  attract  foreign  investment.  However,  it  has  also  increased  the \nshort-term  need  for  balance  of  payment  support.  Pakistan\u2019s  external  debt  increased  by  $1.6 \nbillion  to  $36.9  billion  in  the  second  half  of  2006.  As  a  percentage  of  GDP,  external  debt \nremained on a downward trajectory, declining to 25.4% in December 2006 from 31% in FY2005. \nThis  trend  is  forecast  to  continue  under  the  debt  sustainability  framework  of  the  International \nMonetary Fund for Pakistan for the period from FY2001 to FY2010.2 \n\nto  continue  structural  reforms, \n\nincluding  privatization, \n\nto  strengthen \n\n                                                 \n1  This section should be read in conjunction with the country information provided in the following publications: Asian \nDevelopment  Bank.  2007.

Capital  markets \nfacilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  and  their  efficient  allocation  into  productive \ninvestments  by  providing  efficient  savings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors,  and \ndiversifying  funding  sources  for  enterprises.  This  diversification  also  makes  the  corporate  and \nfinancial sectors more resilient to shocks, which enhances the sustainability of development. \n\n5. \nPakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since 1998, when a year-long \neconomic and financial crisis culminated in a breakdown of the capital market. Since then, with \nsupport  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  enabling  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for the capital market has been strengthened; the financial health of most \nailing  financial  institutions  restored;  a  large  number  of  state-owned  institutions  privatized;  and \ncompetition invigorated. Yet, domestic capital markets do not play a significant role in financial \nintermediation and resource mobilization.  \n\n6. \nThis  is  confirmed  by  macroeconomic  data:  In  FY2005,  national  savings  amounted  to \n16.4%  of  GDP  in  Pakistan,  i.e.,  the  same  level  as  in  FY2000  (Table  1).  The  percentage  of \nsavings  intermediated  by  the  financial  system  amounted  to  7.5%  of  GDP  (46%  of  national \nsavings) in FY2005, up from 4.8% of GDP (29% of national savings) in FY2000. However, this \nincrease  was  due  to  successful  banking  reforms,  which  resulted  in  enhanced  banking \nintermediation.  In  contrast,  intermediation  through  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs) \ndeclined over the last 6 years. \n\nFY2002 \n18.6 \n5.9 \n3.3 \n1.9 \n1.3 \n(0.9) \n0.2 \n0.0 \n\nFY2000 \n16.5 \n4.8 \n0.7 \n2.4 \n1.8 \n(0.3) \n0.2 \n0.1 \n\nFY2003 \n20.6 \n10.0 \n5.4 \n2.8 \n1.3 \n0.0 \n0.5 \n0.0 \n\nFY2005 \n16.4 \n7.5 \n6.5 \n(0.7) \n1.3 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n0.0 \n\nTable 1: Trends and Structure of Financial Savings  \n(percent of gross domestic product) \nFY2001 \n16.5 \n4.4 \n3.1 \n1.1 \n0.5 \n(0.3) \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\nItem \n \nFY2004 \nNational Savings \n18.7 \nFinancial Savings \n7.8 \n  Bank Deposits \n5.4 \n \nInvestments in NSS \n0.0 \n  Currency in Circulation  \n1.5 \n  Deposits of NBFIs \n0.1 \n  Mutual Funds \n0.7 \n0.0 \n  Government Funds \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, NSS = national savings scheme, NBFI = nonbank financial institution. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \nSector data support this view: Total financial sector assets amounted to 79% of GDP in \n7. \n2005  ($87  billion  equivalent),  up  from  73%  ($50  billion)  in  2001.  Over  the  same  period,  the \nshare  of  banking  assets  within  the  financial  sector  increased  from  63.7%  to  70.4%,  while  the \nshare  of  the  state-owned  Central  Directorate  of  National  Savings,  i.e.,  the  biggest  institutional \ninvestor in the country, fell from 25.7% to 18.1% of total financial sector assets. All other NBFIs \ntogether  accounted  for  11.6%  of  total  financial  sector  assets  in  FY2005,  marginally  up  from \n10.5% in FY2001. In conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s financial sector is less balanced now than 6 years \nago. Banking has gained ground in relative as well as absolute terms. \n \n8. \nIn  contrast,  capital  market  instruments  are  not  yet  an  important  source  of  corporate \nfinance. Capital raised through equity and bond issues together was equivalent to only 0.3% of \nGDP  in  2005.  Banking  products  are  still  much  more  relevant  for  resource  mobilization  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n \n\ncapital  formation  than  securities.  While  this  is  the  case  in  many  countries,  banking  system \ndevelopment in Pakistan is not out of touch with that of most comparable economies, whereas \ncapital market development lags (Table 2). \n\n9. \n\nAppendix 2 presents a detailed capital market sector analysis. \n\nTable 2: Financial Sector Development, 2000\u20132006 \n \n\n \nBonds in \nCirculation \n(% of GDP) \n\n \nEquity Market \nCapitalizationa \n(% of GDP) \n\n \nBank \nDeposits \n(% of GDP) \n2000  2005 \n45.6 \n38.8 \n58.0 \n46.3 \n40.3 \n48.2 \n98.9 \n88.6 \n43.3 \n35.3 \n47.4 \n54.1 \n83.6 \n93.8 \n\n \n \n \n \nCountry \nPRC \nIndia \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPakistan \nPhilippines \nThailand \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Number of shares of all listed companies multiplied by their market price. \nb While market capitalization for India at the end of 2006 is available, nominal GDP is still estimated. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Federation of World Exchanges, and International Monetary Fund. \n \n\n2000  2005 \n25.3 \n32.2 \n136.8 \n54.8 \n29.5 \n15.0 \n133.0  140.5 \n41.9 \n10.1 \n114.8 \n51.1 \n73.7 \n36.3 \n\n2006 \n92.3 \n92.3 b\n38.1 \n155.9 \n35.5 \n58.5 \n67.66\n\n2000 \n21.6 \n25.5 \n32.5 \n82.9 \n7.5 \n27.7 \n26.4 \n\n2005 \n40.7 \n37.7 \n19.5 \n94.9 \n8.0 \n41.1 \n45.9 \n\nCorporate \nBonds in \nCirculation \n(% of GDP) \n2000 \n7.8 \n\u2014 \n1.5 \n51.5 \n0.1 \n0.4 \n12.8 \n\n2005 \n13.2\n\u2014 \n2.5\n55.4\n0.5\n0.3\n24.4\n\n1. \n\nStructure and Institutions \n\nthree  stock  exchanges  based \n\nPakistan\u2019s  capital  market  comprises \n\n10. \nin  Karachi, \nIslamabad,  and  Lahore;  a  National  Clearing  and  Settlement  System;  a  Central  Depositary \nCompany; about 300 brokers; and two rating agencies. All three exchanges are fully private and \nmutually owned by their broker members. However, preparations for the demutualization of all \nthree  exchanges  are  under  way.  More  than  700  of  the  approximately  2,800  registered  public \ncompanies are listed at one or more stock exchanges. Only listed companies can make public \nissuance  of  securities  in  Pakistan.  Further,  there  is  a  large  number  of  NBFIs  including  54 \ninsurance  companies,  40  mutual  funds,  5  development  financial  institutions,  8  investment \nbanks, 20 leasing companies, and others. Two state-owned institutions, the Central Directorate \nof National Savings and State Life Insurance Company, are the biggest institutional investors. \n\nSince  the  1990s  the  NBFI  sector  has  transformed  rapidly.  The  total  number  of  NBFIs \n11. \nhas declined significantly and their financial soundness has improved. The share of state-owned \nNBFIs  has  declined,  but  is  still  substantial.  In  June  2006,  insurance  companies  accounted  for \nabout 34% of total NBFI assets, mutual funds 23%, and development financial institutions 18%. \nState-owned  institutions  account  for  about  77%  of  total  insurance  assets  and  51%  of  total \nmutual  fund  assets.  Most  development  financial  institutions  are  foreign  sponsored.  Private \npension  funds  have  yet  to  appear  as  a  class  of  institutional  investors  in  Pakistan.  However, \nsome large private companies sponsor a variety of provident funds and pension schemes. \n\n12. \nBanks are increasingly engaged in the capital market as issuer, investor, and provider of \ninvestment  banking  services.  A  number  of  banks  have  established  investment  banking \ndepartments  or  subsidiaries,  and  acquired  brokerage  houses.  Similarly,  some  NBFIs  and \nbrokers  have  acquired  commercial  banks.  Another  trend  is  the  formation  of  groups  of \ncompanies that include various financial institutions. Thus, a relatively complex web of corporate \nstructures is emerging in Pakistan, which calls for a sound policy and regulatory environment.    \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n13. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates and supervises \nthe activities of corporate entities and NBFIs under the 1984 Companies Ordinance, the 1969 \nSecurities  Ordnance,  and  a  number  of  other  laws,  including  the  2000  Insurance  Ordinance. \nSECP  was  set  up  in  pursuance  to  the  1997  SECP  Act.  While  SECP\u2019s  mandate  was  initially \nrestricted  to  securities  markets,  responsibility  for  insurance  and  other  NBFIs  has  been  added \nover  time.  However,  with  regard  to  insurance,  SECP  shares  its  regulatory  powers  with  the \nMinistry  of  Commerce.  Commercial  banks  are  regulated  and  supervised  by  the  State  Bank  of \nPakistan (SBP). \n\n3. \n\nOverall Market Development Trends \n\n14. \nSince 2001, equity market capitalization and share prices have increased substantially in \nPakistan  with  annual  growth  rates  averaging  more  than  50%.  Equity  market  capitalization \nincreased from 9% of GDP in 2001 to 35% in 2006 ($45.5 billion equivalent). However, this was \nlower than in other Asian markets (Table 2). \n\n15. \nThe increase in market capitalization in Pakistan was largely the result of the listing of a \nnumber of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) together with the growth in share prices rather \nthan  successful  capital  mobilization  through  equity  issues  (para.16).  Further,  the  market \nremains  narrow.  The  10  largest  companies  alone  account  for  55%  of  market  capitalization. \nHowever, only an average of 20% of their shares has been floated. This, like in other countries \nin the region, is an important factor behind low market liquidity.  \n\n16.  While other countries in the region face similar problems with market outreach, Pakistan \nis  clearly  lagging  in  terms  of  resource  mobilization  through  the  capital  market.  In  2005,  for \ninstance,  Pakistani  companies  issued  some  $68  million  equivalent  in  new  capital.  This \ncompares to $19.1 billion in India, $4 billion in the People\u2019s Republic of China, $3.7 in Thailand, \n$2 billion in Malaysia, $1 billion in Indonesia, and $900 million in the Philippines. The amounts \nof  equity  capital  raised  in  Pakistan  over  the  preceding  years  were  even  lower.  Similarly,  only \n$203 million equivalent of capital was raised through corporate bond issues in Pakistan in 2005. \nNevertheless,  the  number  of  bond  issues  has  clearly  increased  as  compared  with  the  1990s. \nWhile 9 corporate bonds were issued in 1995\u20131999, 68 corporate bonds were issued in 2000\u2013\n2005. \n\nThe market for government bonds is much larger than that for corporate bonds. Pakistan \n17. \ninvestment  bonds  (PIBs)  are  by  far  the  most  significant  type  of  securities  issued  by  the \nGovernment, with a 91% share of total outstanding federal government bonds (June 2005). In \nJune 2006, $5.1 billion equivalent (about 4% of GDP) of PIBs were in circulation. Maturities in \ncirculation  are  3,  5,  10,  20,  and  30  years.  This  compares  to  a  maximum  maturity  period  of \n7 years for corporate bonds.  \n\n18. \nDerivative  markets  are  almost  nonexistent  in  Pakistan  (with  the  exception  of  currency \nfutures and 1-month single-share futures) due to the underdevelopment of the underlying equity \nand bond markets. \n\n4. \n\nFactors Driving the Market \n\n19. \nPrivatization  through  stock  exchanges  has  been  a  major  factor  driving  the  capital \nmarket,  together  with  macroeconomic  stabilization,  and\u2014to  a  lesser  degree\u2014international \ninvestor diversification, the development of domestic institutional investors, and other reforms. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe Government has divested a large number of SOEs since the 1990s, some by listing \n20. \nand partial privatization through the stock exchange(s). This has clearly been the main driving \nforce  for  market  capitalization  and  share  prices.  Among  the  10  largest  listed  companies \n(para.15) are six SOEs, which together account for 42% of total market capitalization. Shares of \nSOEs offered for sale through the stock market are typically heavily oversubscribed, given the \nexpectation of subsequent increases in share prices which have frequently been substantial. \n\n21. \nUndeniable  progress  has  been  made  with  other  structural  reforms  that  have  led  to \nsubstantial changes such as (i) a higher share of private enterprises in- and outside the financial \nsector;  (ii)  consolidation  of  the  NBFI  subsector,  which  now  consists  of  a  smaller  number  of \nbetter  capitalized  and  more  efficiently  managed  entities;  and  (iii)  a  better  regulatory  and \ninstitutional framework for capital markets. Further, efforts are under way to enhance corporate \ngovernance  and  disclosure,  which  is  important  because  both  figure  prominently  in  investment \ndecisions. On the technical side, significant progress has been made in establishing electronic \nclearing  and  settlement  systems.  However,  that  has  yet  to  turn  the  capital  market  into  a \nsignificant  source  of  capital  formation.  Moderate  progress  has,  nevertheless,  been  made,  as \nevidenced  by  the  increased  number  of  securities  issues.  SBP\u2019s  policy  to  increase  capital \nrequirements for banks has led a number of banks to raise capital through bond issues. \n\n22. \nHigh  economic  growth,  consumer  demand,  and  higher  corporate  earnings  have \nfacilitated  capital  market  development  as  compared  with  the  1990s.  The  same  applies  to  the \nmonetary  environment.  The  exchange  rate  and  inflation  outlook  stabilized  after  1999, \nlengthening  time  horizons  and  reducing  the  cost  of  borrowing.  Interest  rates  declined \nsignificantly during 2001\u20132003. Since 2004, inflation has picked up again and its outlook is less \nstable.  This  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  market  for  government  bonds,  particularly  in  2005. \nThe impact of higher and more volatile inflation and rising interest rates on the corporate bond \nmarket was mitigated by increasingly using floating rates for newly issued corporate bonds. \n\nDomestic  institutional  investors  such  as  mutual  funds  or  insurance  companies  have \n23. \nemerged as a relatively new force in the financial sector. The mutual funds subsector remains \nsmall  relative  to  other  countries  in  the  region.  Individual  investors  account  for  the  bulk  of \nexchange trading. However, in 2005, total assets of mutual funds amounted to $2.3 billion. As \nsuch,  they  are  a  relevant  player.  Equity  funds  now  account  for  85%  of  total  assets  under \nmanagement of mutual funds. In contrast, most assets of insurance companies are invested in \ngovernment  bonds,  only  16%  in  equity.  Investment  of  the  Central  Directorate  of  National \nSavings and the Old Age Benefits Institution is also concentrated in government securities. \n\n24. \nThe investor base of Pakistan issuers of securities is not restricted to domestic investors. \nForeign portfolio investment rose to $334 million during FY2006, up from an aggregate inflow of \n$202 million over the preceding 3 years. The increasing inflow of portfolio investment is in line \nwith  international  and  regional  trends.  One  underlying  factor  is  the  explosion  of  resources \nmobilized by dedicated emerging market funds. Another is that controls on foreign investment in \nshares and bonds have been substantially loosened. Pakistani companies can also raise capital \ninternationally.  Two  Pakistani  companies  have  taken  this  step  so  far  by  listing  on  the  London \nStock Exchange in late-2006.  \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n\n25. \nPakistan does not yet have an integrated financial sector development strategy, though \nSBP  is  currently  drafting  one.  Key  planning  documents  such  as  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-\n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTerm  Development  Framework  for  2005\u20132010,3  however,  list  private  sector  growth,  capital \nmarket  development,  and  private  participation  in  infrastructure  (which  requires  long-term  debt \nfinancing  through  bonds)  as  important  goals.  These  goals  are  likely  to  be  achieved  as  the \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  a  next  generation  reform  agenda  in  banking  (further \nconsolidation,  introduction  of  risk-based  supervision)  and  capital  markets  (adding  depth  to \nmarket development).  \n\n26. \nFollowing  successful  banking  reforms,  the  Government  intends  to  accelerate  capital \nmarket  reforms  to  turn  corporate  securities  into  a  relevant  source  for  long-term  finance  and \nensure a balanced development of the financial sector. Besides deepening capital markets and \nintroducing  new  financing  instruments,  the  Government  is  keen  to  promote  new  savings \ninstruments, in particular pension products, to increase low domestic savings\u2014a key constraint \nto mobilizing financial resources for higher investment. The Government also aims to strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  sector  governance  by  establishing  a  financial  services \ncommission for the regulation and supervision of NBFIs and services. \n\n2.  \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n27. \nKey issues, constraints, and opportunities facing the development of capital markets in \nPakistan include (i) weak enabling environment for nonbank financial companies4, (ii) lack of a \nregulatory  framework  for  private  pension  funds,  (iii)  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  for \ncorporate  bond  issues,  (iv)  high  equity  market  volatility  and  small  public  float,  (v)  weak \ninstitutional framework for capital market regulation and supervision, (vi) difficulties supervising \nfinancial groups, (vii) weak securities market legislation, and (viii) market fragmentation. \n\n28. \nFigure  1  provides  a  schematic  illustration  of  these  issues  and  constraints  for  the \ndeveloping institutional investors, increasing the supply of securities, and establishing a sound \nframework for sector governance and investor protection.  \n\na. \n\nUnderdevelopment  of  Institutional  Investors  Constrains  Long-Term \nCapital Formation and Demand for Securities \n\n29.  While  lack  of  suitable  assets,  including  corporate  equity  and  debt  (bonds),  has  clearly \nhampered  the  development  of  institutional  investors,  the  relative  underdevelopment  of \ncontractual  savings  inhibits,  in  turn,  the  development  of  equity  and  bond  markets.  Studies \nelsewhere  show  a  particularly  strong  causal  relationship  between  the  level  of  development  of \nfunded private pension schemes and life insurance, and the deepening of the capital market. \n \n30.  Weak Enabling Environment for Nonbank Financial Companies. The legal status of \nnonbank  financial  companies,  including  important  classes  of  institutional  investors  such  as \nmutual funds, investment banks, and others, is recognized in the 1984 Companies Ordinance. \nHowever, the Companies Ordinance does not provide a legal mandate for SECP for licensing, \nprudential  regulation,  and  supervision  of  such  companies.  This  is  a  serious  constraint  for  the \nsound development of nonbank financial companies, since it limiting the scope for establishing \nand  enforcing  a  sound  regulatory  framework.  Typically,  regulation  and  supervision  of  such \ncompanies would be covered under a substantive law such as exists in Pakistan for securities \nmarkets and the insurance industry. \n\n                                                 \n3  Planning Commission. 2005. Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010. Islamabad. \n4  The  Government\u2019s  definition  of  nonbank  financial  companies  includes  companies  engaged  in  the  business  of \nleasing,  investment  finance  services,  discounting  services,  housing  finance  services,  venture  capital  investment, \nasset management services or investment advisory services, and modarabas. Nonbank financial companies are, as \nsuch, a subgroup of nonbank financial institutions. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Overview of Constraints and Opportunities \n\nDemand Side\u2014Investors\n\nNonbank Financial Companies \n\nPrivate Pension Funds \n\nMutual funds single most important type \n\nHuge potential demand \n\nState-owned fund NIT distorts competition \n\nNo regulatory framework for voluntary private pension and \noccupational pension \n\nWeak legal basis for regulation and supervision \n\nWeak supervisory capacity \n\nRemaining weaknesses in regulatory framework for \nprudential supervision \n\nExisting policy constraints outreach to 1.6 million taxpayers \n\nSupply Side\u2014Securities Issues\n\nCorporate Bonds \n\nCorporate Equity \n\nLack of benchmark yield curve for pricing corporate bonds \n\nHigh market volatility due to speculative trading \n\nStamp duty increases cost and discourages longer maturities \n\nPublic float very small compared with capitalization \n\nSteep listing and rating requirement increase cost \n\nUnderwriting concept rigid and risky for lead manager\u2014\nconcept of \u201cbest efforts\u201d not yet introduced \n\nNo shelf-registration to provide flexibility and reduce cost \n\nNational Savings Scheme instruments distort competition \n\nNo shelf-registration to provide flexibility and reduce cost \n\nGovernance and Investor Protection\n\nRegulatory Body \n\nHolding Companies \n\nSecurities Markets \n\nBrokers and Sales \n\nSECP not codified as \nnonbank financial services \nagency\u2014weak enforcement \npowers \n\nAbout 60 groups, many of \nwhich include financial \ninstitutions \n\nGovernance setup \nundermines efficiency, \nindependence, and \naccountability \n\nNontransparent \nownership, financial \nflows, and risks\n\nSupervision difficult\u2014 \nsystemic risks \n\nTax policies hinder \nformation of transparent \nholding companies\n\nLegal basis outdated \n\nWeak linkages between \nexchanges\u2014fragmentation, \ninefficient price discovery, \nweak investor protection \n\nWeak self regulation \n\nUneven disclosure and \ngovernance requirements \nfor listed and unlisted public \ncompanies \n\nLow professional \nstandards \n\nLack of training \n\nNo certification \nmechanism \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n31.  Mutual funds are the single most important type of institutional investors in Pakistan. The \nstate-owned  National  Investment  Trust  (NIT)  is  by  far  the  largest  mutual  fund,  with  assets  of \n$1.4 billion under management, equivalent to 37% of total assets of the mutual fund industry (as \nof April 2007). NIT\u2019s dominating market position and implicit credit guarantee as a state-owned \ncompany constrain the development of private sector mutual funds by distorting competition. \n \n32. \nLack  of  Regulatory  Framework  for  Private  Pension  Funds.  The  introduction  of \nprivate pension schemes could have a significant positive impact on the development of equity \nand  bond  markets,  and  vice  versa.  However,  this  requires  such  schemes  to  be  properly \nregulated to protect the pension savings of individuals. In Pakistan, a regulatory framework for \nvoluntary  contribution-funded  private  pension  schemes  has  yet  to  be  established.  The  same \napplies to employer-sponsored pension arrangements, for which SECP is assigned authority (as \nfor other private pension products). However, these schemes currently have no direct oversight \nor supervision other than by tax authorities. This constitutes a regulatory gap that is potentially \ndangerous as it leaves participants unprotected. \n\n \n\nb.  \n\nUnderdeveloped  Market  for  Corporate  Securities  Limits  Securities \nSupply  \n\n33. \nAs in many other countries, Pakistan\u2019s financial sector is dominated by banks. However, \nunlike  most  other  countries,  bank  dominance  has  increased  over  the  last  5  years  (para.  7). \nOverreliance on the limited range of banking services and products is not only a constraint for \nsavings mobilization and investment finance, it also poses considerable risks to the stability of \nthe financial sector and the economy in total as experienced during the Asian financial crisis. \n \n34. \nRegulatory and Policy Constraints on Corporate Bond Issues. Corporate bonds are \nnormally priced at a premium over a risk-free rate of return (yield) on government bonds or other \nbenchmark  debt  instrument  with  comparable  maturity.  The  Government  issues  a  considerable \nvolume  of  debt  instruments.  However,  these  instruments  are  mostly  not  tradable  (tradable \ngovernment  securities  such  as  PIBs  or  treasury  bills  together  accounted  for  only  32%  of \noutstanding debt in June 2006). Further, the terms of tradable government securities, including \nmaturity  periods,  and  the  volume  of  issues  vary  considerably.  Both  factors  have  undermined \nefforts  to  build  a  government  benchmark  yield  curve.  Consequently,  the  pricing  of  corporate \nbonds is very difficult, which in turn clearly impedes corporate bond market development. \n \n35. \nThe 1899 Stamp Duty Act gives provincial authorities the right to levy a stamp duty on \nterm finance certificates, i.e., corporate bonds. Until 2005, the rate was uniformly 0.15% of the \nissued volume or Rs1,000,000 ($17,000 equivalent), whichever is lower. In the Province of the \nPunjab this rate was reduced to 0.05% through the 2006 budget act. However, the Government \nof Punjab decided to levy the duty annually rather than just once. This means the rate is higher \nnow  for  bonds  with  a  maturity  longer  than  2  years.  The  Sindh  Provincial  Government  only \nmarginally  reduced  the  duty  for  secondary  issues.  The  Islamabad  Capital  Territory  has  not \nchanged the original rates from 0.15%. \n \n36. \nStamp duties are a serious policy distortion that undermines the Government\u2019s objective \nto  achieve  balanced  development  of  the  financial  sector.  The  duties  increase  the  cost  of \ncorporate bond issues and lower their competitiveness as compared with bank loans, which are \nnot  taxed.  This  is  a  key  reason  why  the  average  amount  of  public  corporate  bond  issues  has \nbeen  at  around  $20  million  for  years,  which  appears  very  high  as  compared  with  the  size  of \ntypical investment projects in the country. Smaller volumes are not competitive financially due to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n \n\nthe  stamp  duty  (and  other  regulatory  constraints  that  increase  the  cost  of  issuing  bonds; \nparas.37\u201338). Further, annual levies clearly act as a disincentive for the issuance of long-term \nbonds.  This  significantly  undermines  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to  attract  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure,  where  long-term  debt  finance  (through  bonds)  is  particularly \nimportant. From a fiscal revenue perspective, stamp duties on corporate bonds are insignificant, \ngiven the small number of bonds issued (only six public bond issues in FY2006, for instance). \n \n37. \nSECP  has  not  authorized  trading  in  publicly  offered  corporate  bonds  outside  the  stock \nexchanges.  Instead,  corporate  bonds  are  required  to  be  listed  and  traded  within  an  electronic \ntrading system established at the exchanges. This constrains bond market development, since it \nincreases  the  cost  of  issuing  bonds  (in  the  form  of  listing  and  rating  fees)  without  generating \nbenefits.  As  debt  instruments,  corporate  bonds  are  typically  bought  by  institutional  investors \nrather than retail investors. Further, even in mature financial markets, bonds are typically held \nuntil  maturity  and  traded  only  infrequently  (normally  by  phone  through  an  informal  over-the-\ncounter market). Therefore, forcing corporate bonds into listing and trading on a formal trading \nplatform,  essentially  designed  for  a  listed  share  market  with  a  large  order  flow  from  retail \ninvestors, makes little sense. \n \n38. \nIssuing corporate bonds involves cost in the form of registration fees and other charges \nthat  may  be  levied  by  the  regulatory  body.  Further,  the  registration  process  takes  time.  The \nregulatory  framework  for  bond  issues  should  strike  a  balance  between  the  public  interest  of \ninvestor protection, which is the key justification for regulation, and the need to make bonds a \ncompetitive instrument for investment finance. \u201cShelf-registration\u201d5 of bonds (and equity), which \nhelps to strike this balance, has been international practice for many years. However, securities \nmarket  regulation  in  Pakistan  does  not  support  the  concept  of  shelf  registration.  This \nsignificantly reduces the competitiveness of bonds as a means of investment finance. \n \n39. \nHigh  interest  payments  for  instruments  offered  by  the  Government\u2019s  National  Savings \nScheme (NSS), which is administered by the Central Directorate of National Savings, hindered \nbond market development for years. As a step toward addressing the problem, the authorities \nintroduced  a  formula  linking  interest  on  NSS  instruments  to  yields  on  PIBs.  However,  NSS \ninstruments  still  appear  attractive  since  their  pricing  fails  to  take  into  account  that  NSS \ninstruments  can  be  redeemed  any  time  without  redemption  charges,  whereas  selling \ninstruments with comparable yields involves such charges and/or other costs. Further, another \nstep  taken  (in  March  2000)  to  provide  equal  opportunities  for  corporate  bonds  was  a  ban  on \ninstitutional  investment  in  NSS  instruments.  This  ban  helped  to  increase  the  number  of  public \ncorporate  bond  issues  significantly.  However,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  reversed  this \ndecision in late 2006 so that institutional investors are able to invest in NSS instruments again.  \n \n40. \nOverall,  given  the  large  total  volume  of  NSS  instruments  (which  account  for  41%  of \ngovernment debt) and their pricing, institutional investment in NSS instruments crowds out long-\nterm investment in corporate bonds. Further, issuing a large percentage of government debt in \nthe form of NSS bonds undermines the Government\u2019s efforts to build a benchmark yield curve \nfor corporate debt by establishing a liquid market for treasury bills and PIBs. \n \n41. \nHigh  Equity  Market  Volatility  and  Small  Public  Float.  The  Pakistan  stock  market  is \nhighly volatile. This is partly due to a high volume of speculative short-term individual investment \nin shares. Following the increase of the capital value tax on all stock market transactions at the \n\n                                                 \n5  It allows the issuer to go through the full registration process for a new issue once, and offer additional volumes of \nthe  security  (with  the  same  terms)  over  a  specified  period  of  time,  as  needed  and  when  market  conditions  allow, \nwithout being exposed to the same (costly and time-consuming) registration process. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nend of 2006, trading volumes reportedly dropped by about 30%. The capital value tax affects all \ntransactions: whether profitable or loss-making, short-term speculative or long-term oriented, or \nundertaken by retail or institutional investments. However, it is comparatively easy to levy and \nadminister. A capital gains tax is in place, but income from investment in shares is exempt. \n \n42. \nAnother  factor  explaining  high  stock  market  volatility  is  the  thin  public  float  (shares \navailable  for  trading)  of  the  largest  listed  companies.  This  is  mainly  the  result  of  the  existing \nprivatization policy that foresees an initial public offering (IPO) of only a limited number of SOE \nshares, usually 5%\u201310% of the total, to establish a market price. This market price can then be \ntaken as a reference point for subsequent sales of larger share packages to strategic investors.  \n \n43. \nHowever, in many cases, the subsequent privatization to a strategic investor occurs with \na  substantial  delay,  if  at  all.  This  is  primarily  due  to  increasing  public  opposition  against  this \napproach,  which  is  perceived  as  not  sufficiently  transparent  and,  consequently  prone  to \ncorruption  and  often  subject  to  public  interest  litigation.6  In  fact,  while  the  current  approach  to \nprivatization  though  an  IPO  and  subsequent  sale  to  a  strategic  investor  may  have  merits  with \nregard to some SOEs, it fails to acknowledge that well-prepared, sequenced sales of blocks of \nSOE shares to the public can increase the transparency of privatization, strengthen governance \nand  performance  of  SOEs,  and  maximize  the  returns  of  the  sales  of  state  assets  over  the \nmedium and long term. The present approach also fails to take into account its negative impact \non  market  liquidity  and  volatility,  and  thus  capital  market  development.  While  many  IPOs  of \nSOEs seem to be undertaken professionally, they are deal-driven and not embedded in a well-\ndesigned overall privatization strategy. \n \n\nc. \n\nWeak  Capital  Market  Governance  Results \nTransparency and Weak Investor Protection \n\nin  Poor  Market \n\n44.  Weak  Institutional  Framework  for  Regulation  and  Supervision.  SECP  has,  over \ntime,  been  assigned  responsibility  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  securities  market \nand  most  categories  of  NBFIs.  However,  a  number  of  weaknesses  in  the  structural  and  legal \nframework  affect  effective  prudential  or  market  conduct  regulation  by  the  SECP.  The  overall \nenabling  legislation,  especially  the  1997  SECP  law,  does  not  provide  adequate  independence \nand  accountability  required  for  SECP  to  effectively  instill  and  oversee  implementation  of  good \ngovernance for the large part of the financial sector for which it is in charge. More specifically, \nSECP\u2019s institutional independence is undermined by inadequate terms for the appointment and \ndismissal  of  senior  personnel.  Further,  SECP\u2019s  governance  structure  mixes  executive  powers \nwith responsibilities for policy making, and fails to assign responsibility for key aspects such as \naccounting, law, and policy making to distinct senior officials. Furthermore, SECP\u2019s supervisory \nindependence, i.e., its ability to exercise its judgment and powers in such matters as licensing, \ninspections,  sanctioning,  and  enforcement  of  sanctions  is  undermined  by  insufficient  legal \nprotection for its staff in the performance of their duties.  \n\n45.  With  regard  to  proper  accountability,  without  which  independence  cannot  be  effective, \nSECP primarily reports to MOF. This arrangement brings SECP under the direct control of the \nGovernment  and  undermines  its  independence,  which  is  clearly  inferior  to  one  that  creates  a \nnetwork  of  complementary  and  overlapping  checking  mechanisms  through  the  executive, \nlegislative,  and  judicial  branches  of  government,  and  the  industry  and  public  at  large.  Such  a \nframework  would  ensure  that  none  of  these  stakeholders  control  SECP  entirely  (and \nundermines its independence), but SECP is nonetheless under public control.     \n\n                                                 \n6  An example would be the 2006 Supreme Court ruling against the (strategic) privatization of Pakistan Steel Mill.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n \n\nNontransparent  Financial  Groups.  Holding  companies  are  permitted  under  the  1984 \n46. \nCompanies Ordinance. However, the actual formation of holding companies is impeded by tax \npolicy distortions that can result in double taxation of corporate income of affiliated companies \nwithin a holding company.7 This is the main reason why only few of the approximately 60 groups \nof companies in Pakistan were established under a holding company. This is not only negative \nfor the competitiveness of these groups, but also for financial sector regulation and supervision. \nSECP and SBP find it often difficult, if not impossible, to discern the actual owners of financial \nentities  in  a  complex  financial  group;  monitor  transactions  between  financial  institutions  within \nthe  group;  and  enforce  laws  and  regulations,  including  prudential  requirements.  This \nsignificantly increases systemic risks in the financial sector. \n\n47. \nThe structuring of groups that include banks and NBFIs under a holding company would \nallow  these  groups  to  attain  the  benefits  of  a  diversified  financial  services  provider  while \nstrengthening the ability of the group to engage in sound risk management practices. Further, it \nwould enable the regulatory body to require that prudential standards be calibrated with the risk \nof  undertaking  diversified  financial  business,  and  that  financial  and  operating  reporting \nrequirements  be  in  line  with  international  best  practices  for  all  types  of  financial  institutions \nincluded in the group. This is especially important in an emerging financial services environment \nwhere risk management skills and supervision capacity are relatively weak.  \n\n48.  Weak  Securities  Market  Legislation.  The  1969  Securities  Ordinance  has  been \nfrequently  amended  over  time,  but  is  still  outdated  in  some  major  areas.  Among  its  many \nweaknesses, it fails to provide SECP with sufficient investigative and enforcement powers (not \naddressed by the 1997 SECP Law) and lacks provisions governing important areas and aspects \nof  modern  securities  markets,  such  as  collective  investment  schemes  or  various  levels  of \ncommitments for underwriting securities (\u201cbest efforts\u201d). \n\n49. \nCurrently  securities  market  regulation  requires  investment  banks  and  brokers  (or  such \ndivisions in commercial banks) to firmly commit to underwrite issues of securities they want to \nbring to the market for their clients. That means they guarantee to purchase by themselves the \namount  that  cannot  be  placed  with  other  investors,  despite  their  \u201cbest  efforts\u201d  to  achieve  this. \nThis  harbors  significant  risks  to  investment  banks  and  brokers,  particularly  in  the  case  of  an \nIPO, which entails the sale of securities for which a market price is not available. Underwriters, \ntherefore, tend to underprice IPOs, which lowers proceeds to the issuer. As a result, companies \nare very reluctant to raise capital through a stock exchange listing. \n\nFurther,  the  1969  Securities  Ordinance  does  not  clearly  define  the  concepts  of  private \n50. \nplacement and public offers, and focuses on the regulation and supervision of stock exchanges \nand  listed  companies  rather  than  public  companies  and  public  securities  (whether  or  not  they \nare listed). SECP\u2019s legal powers over unlisted public companies and issues are, therefore, very \nlimited. Even the corporate governance and disclosure standards for listed companies flow out \nof (voluntary) listing standards established by stock exchanges rather than the Securities Law. \nThe  law  does  not,  as  such,  achieve  a  key  objective  of  securities  market  legislation,  i.e.,  to \nprovide an adequate legal basis for investor protection, and thereby facilitate capital formation. \n\n51. \nUneven corporate governance and disclosure requirements for listed and unlisted public \ncompanies  create  regulatory  arbitrage  and  disincentives  for  listing,  which  undermines  investor \nprotection. In Pakistan unlisted public companies can enjoy the benefits of being public (in the \nform  of  a  broader  investor  base),  while  avoiding  the  stricter  corporate  governance  and \n                                                 \n7  A  detailed  analysis  of  these  tax  distortions  is  in  the  Draft  Report  of  the  Task  Force  on  Review  of  Tax  Laws  of \nHolding Companies,  which  was established by the Central Board of Revenue in August 2006, and comprises the \nCentral Board of Revenue, SECP, and Pakistan Business Council.       \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\ndisclosure standards that are normally required from public companies to protect investors. This \nis an important reason why the stock exchanges have not attracted more issuers in the past and \nlost a significant number of public companies though delisting. \n\nUntested Competence of Professional Market Participants. A growing retail investor \n52. \nbase will require quality investor support services and better market information. At present, no \nmechanism  is  in  place  to  increase  professional  standards  and  qualification  of  stock  brokers, \nmutual  fund  sales  agents,  or  compliance  officers.  If  appropriate  training  and  certification \nprograms were implemented, this would enhance professionalism in the securities markets and \nimprove investor protection. In other jurisdictions, such training is normally provided by a private \ntraining  institute  or  a  self-regulatory  organization.  The  actual  tests  for  competence  are \nadministered by the securities market regulator or a self-regulatory organization, which is best \npractice  in  many  countries.  With  the  expected  privatization  of  NIT-managed  funds,  the \nstrengthening  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  establishment  of  a  training  and  certification \nprogram for securities market professionals and other NBFI agents and intermediaries become \nespecially important. \n\n53.  Market  Fragmentation.  Although  the  vast  majority  of  listed  securities  are  traded  on \nmore  than  one  exchange  in  Pakistan,  the  market  remains  fragmented,  which  undermines  its \nefficiency, particularly with regard to price discovery and investor confidence. This is mainly due \nto  weak  linkages  between  the  exchanges.  The  three  exchanges  do  not  have  any  systematic \nexchange  of  price  and  other  information.  Self-regulation  of  the  exchanges  is  weak,  and  no \nmechanism  is  in  place  to  coordinate  intermarket  surveillance  and  development  of  a  plan  for \nsharing self-regulatory responsibilities. Brokers are not required to execute orders of their clients \nin  the  best  interests  of  the  latter  in  a  fair  and  transparent  manner.  Due  to  lack  of  price \ninformation  from  other  exchanges,  brokers  are  often  not  in  the  position  to  avail  of  quotations \nfrom other exchanges. Options for strengthening investor protection and efficiency of the market \nby  addressing  its  fragmentation  and  increasing  transparency  include  (i)  merge  the  three \nexchanges, or (ii) strengthen linkages between exchanges to achieve a unified national market \nsystem  in  securities,  which  would  consist  of  several  exchanges.  The  second  is  more  realistic \nunder the present circumstances. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n54. \nADB has been supporting financial sector development in Pakistan since 1995 when the \nFinancial  Sector  Intermediation  Loan  was  approved.8  While  this  loan  included  a  small  capital \nmarket  component  (it  focused  on  banking),  only  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program \n(CMDP),9  approved  in  1997  together  with  a  TA  loan  for  capacity  building,10  initiated \ncomprehensive capital market reforms.   \n\nThe  CMDP  was  broad  based  and  touched  on  all  integral  components  of  the  capital \n55. \nmarket. According to its performance audit report, the CMDP was successfully implemented and \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  1995.

Manila (Loan 1577-PAK[SF], approved on 6 November, for $5 million).   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n \n\nproduced  concrete  results.11  These  include  (i)  establishing  SECP;  (ii)  modernizing  the \ninfrastructure  of  stock  exchanges;  (iii)  fully  operationalizing  automated  trading  and  the  central \ndepositary systems; (iv) establishing a national  clearing and settlement system; (v) liberalizing \nmutual  fund  investment  policies  and  harmonizing  taxation  of  private  and  state-owned  mutual \nfunds;  (vi)  disallowing  institutional  investment  in  NSS  instruments  to  support  corporate  bond \nmarket development; and (vii) establishing basic  regulatory frameworks for insurance, leasing, \nand asset-backed securities. \n\nBuilding  on  the  CMDP  agenda,  ADB  approved  the  Financial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and \n56. \nGovernance Program (FMGP) in 2002.12 The FMGP consisted of a program loan, a political risk \nguarantee facility, and two TA loans aimed at (i) strengthening pension, insurance, and savings \nsystems;  and  (ii)  strengthening  regulation,  enforcement,  and  governance  of  nonbank  financial \nmarkets. Key achievements of the FMGP include (i) SECP capacity building for on-site and off-\nsite  inspections,  (ii)  establishment  of  regulatory  frameworks  for  money  markets  and  futures, \n(iii) strengthened  disclosure  and  governance  requirements  for  listed  companies  and  NBFIs, \n(iv) establishment  of  professional  standards  for  accountants  and  auditors,  (v)  establishment  of \nan  enabling  environment  for  demutualization  of  stock  exchanges,  (vi)  harmonization  of  tax \ntreatment of government and corporate bonds, and (vii) floatation of 10 SOEs through the stock \nexchange. However, the FMGP had a number of complex amendments to financial sector laws, \ncovering  an  array  of  issues  in  various  subsectors.  The  legal  process  has  been  considerably \ndelayed  and  not  reached  a  closure  to  date.  Further,  the  financial  sector  has  changed \nsignificantly  since  FMGP\u2019s  approval  in  2002,  which  has  necessitated  a  reprioritization  of  the \nsector  reform  agenda.  The  Government,  therefore,  proposed  that  (i)  certain  aspects  of  the \nreform measures under the FMGP (particularly those relating to capital market development) be \npursued  and  strengthened  under  the  proposed  Program,  and  (ii)  other  aspects  of  the  reform \nmeasures under the FMGP (such as those relating to insurance and corporate governance) be \ncarried  out  more  comprehensively  over  the  course  of  2008-2010  through  more  focused \ninterventions  such  as  a  contractual  savings  reform  program  and  an  export  competitiveness \ndevelopment  program.  Pursuant  to  this  and  a  request  from  the  Government  to  cancel  the \nremaining  amount  under  the  second  tranche  of  the  FMGP  following  release  of  the  incentive \ntranche in September 2005, ADB canceled the pending tranche of $80 million in May 2007.  \n \nThe  proposed  Program  will  support  a  second  generation  of  capital  market  reforms, \n57. \nbuilding on the key achievements under the CMDP and FMGP. Table A3.1 in Appendix 3 sets \nout the policy areas under the FMGP that will be carried forward under the proposed Program. \nFigure  A3  outlines  how  the  achievements  of  previous  ADB-supported  interventions  will  be \nsustained through the proposed Program. \n\n58. \nADB\u2019s  support  complements  that  of  other  external  funding  agencies,  with  whom  ADB \nhas  coordinated  closely  throughout.  ADB\u2019s  1995  Financial  Sector  Intermediation  Loan  shared \nthe  same  purpose,  scope,  and  policy  requirements  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Sector \nDeepening  and  Intermediation  Project,  which  was  approved  in  1994.  Subsequently,  ADB \nembarked into capital market development support, while the World Bank has been focusing on \nbanking  reforms.13  The  World  Bank  approved  the  Banking  Sector  Adjustment  Loan  (for  $250 \nmillion)  in  1997,  followed  by  the  Banking  Sector  Restructuring  and  Privatization  Project  (for \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006.

The  International \nFinance  Corporation  has  undertaken  debt  and  equity  investments  in  a  number  of  financial \ninstitutions, including Tameer Microfinance Bank (2005), International Housing Finance Limited \n(2005),  and  Habib  Bank  Limited  (2006).  It  has  also  participated  in  establishing  a  mutual  fund, \nABAMCO  Composite  Fund  (2004),  and  a  private  equity  fund,  Jahangir  Siddiqui  Private  Equity \nFund I (2005). \n\n4.  \n\nLessons \n\n59. \nRelevant  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  program  lending  in  general,  and  with \nfinancial sector development in particular, have been incorporated in the design of the proposed \nProgram. An important lesson is that policy actions requiring comprehensive legal reforms can \nhamper program implementation, notwithstanding a government\u2019s strong support for a program. \nUnder  the  FMGP,  the  Government  was  required  to  draft  or  amend  a  total  of  nine laws.14  This \nwas  partly  the  response  to  a  previous  neglect  of  legal  reforms.  However,  while  strong \ncommitment  of  the  Government\u2019s  executive  branch  for  legal  reforms  under  the  FMGP  was \nhelpful  in  maintaining  implementing  agencies  and  the  Parliament  focused  on  proposed \nlegislation, this could not ensure the timely preparation of all recommended pieces of legislation \nand  their  subsequent  passage  by  the  legislature.  The  laws  covered  complex  technical  issues, \ndealt  with  a  range  of  vested  interests  and  required  extensive  stakeholder  consultations.  The \nproposed Program will focus on just two key pieces of legislation, namely a new securities law \nand a law that codifies a consolidated nonbank financial regulatory agency. Further, TA will be \nprovided  to  ensure  that  the  draft  laws  comply  with  international  standards,  and  provide \nassistance, as needed, throughout the legislative deliberation process. \n\nimplementation \n\n60. \nFurther, effective implementation of development initiatives requires strong Government \nin  difficult \nownership.  Although  political  disruptions  delayed  CMDP \nmacroeconomic circumstances, strong commitment of MOF as the executing agency and solid \nsupport  from  SECP  as  the  implementing  agency  prevented  the  CMDP  from  derailing  and \nenabled  its  successful  completion.  Many  problems  that  could  not  be  foreseen  at  program \nformulation  were  thus  resolved  through  concerted  efforts  of  the  officials  concerned.15  The \nproposed  Program  generates  the  required  Government  ownership  by  taking  into  account  the \nreform proposals formulated under a number of stakeholder initiatives that are, among others, \nsponsored  by  MOF  and  SECP.  This  particularly  relates  to  corporate  securities  market \ndevelopment and tax reforms. Further, while the new Securities Law and the Financial Services \nCommission  of  Pakistan  (FSCP)  law  were  drafted  with  ADB  support  in  2005,  they  have \nsubsequently  been  comprehensively  adjusted  by  SECP  staff  to  fit  national  conditions  and  are \nnow fully owned by SECP. \n\n61. \nFurthermore, financial sector development takes place over time and require a series of \ninterventions in any environment. Financial market development in general, and prudential and \nmarket  conduct  regulation  in  particular,  have  taken  decades  of  reforms  even  in  advanced \ncountries. Governance of financial market intermediaries is constantly evolving in many parts of \n                                                 \n14  This  includes  (i)  amending  the  1984  Companies  Ordinance  or  drafting  and  enacting  a  new  company  law, \n(ii) amending  the  1888  Trust Act,  (iii)  replacing  the  1997  SECP  Act  1997  with  a  new  law,  (iv)  replacing  the  1969 \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Ordinance  with  a  new  law,  (v)  amending  the  1997  Central  Depository  Act,  (vi)  drafting \nand  enacting  a  corporate  rehabilitation  act  (bankruptcy  law),  (vii)  enacting  legislation  on  demutualization  of \nexchanges,  (viii)  drafting  and  enacting  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act,  and  (ix)  amending  the  2000  Insurance \nOrdinance.   \n\n15  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n \n\nthe  world.  As  such,  financial  sector  reforms  in  developing  countries  such  as  Pakistan  require \nlong-term commitment by development partners for continuous support to introduce and enforce \ndifficult and costly changes. A multitude of supportive policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional \nframeworks have to be established gradually over time in several rounds of reforms. Every new \nround  has  to  advance  the  unfinished  agenda  while  making  necessary  adjustments  to  past \nreforms to conform to changing economic and political developments. The CMDP successfully \nbuilt on the Financial Sector Intermediation Loan. The FMGP helped to address the unfinished \nagenda  of  the  CMDP.  Building  on  achievements  made  under  the  CMDP  and  FMGP,  the \nproposed Program will support a second round of comprehensive reforms in capital markets. \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n62. \nThe impact of the Program will be enhanced economic growth through a more efficient \nand  better  balanced  financial  system.  The  Program\u2019s  outcome  will  be  increased  resource \nmobilization  through  the  capital  market  for  productive  investment  and  employment  generation \nby  providing  efficient  savings  vehicles  for  retail  and  institutional  investors  and  diversifying \nfunding  sources  for  enterprises.  This  diversification  will  also  make  the  corporate  and  financial \nsector more resilient to shocks. More specifically, the Program will (i) support the development \nof  institutional  investors  to  facilitate  long-term  capital  formation  and  increase  the  demand  for \nsecurities,  (ii)  improve  the  efficiency  of  securities  markets  to  increase  the  supply  of  corporate \nsecurities  and  optimize  the  allocation  of  financial  resources  into  productive  investment,  and \n(iii) strengthen capital market governance to improve market transparency and protect investors.  \n\n63. \nTo  achieve  its  objectives,  the  Program  will  (i)  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for \nprivate  pension  funds  and  other  institutional  investors;  (ii)  address  policy  and  regulatory \nconstraints to the development of corporate bond markets; (iii) increase equity market breadth \nand  reduce  its  volatility;  (vi)  strengthen  the  institutional  framework  for  sector  supervision  by \ntransforming  SECP  into  the  Financial  Services  Commission  of  Pakistan  (FSCP)  for  the \nregulation and supervision of NBFIs; and (v) strengthen the governance of securities markets, \nmarket professionals, and public issuers. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n64. \nThe policy actions supported under the Program build on (i) international capital market \ndevelopment  experience;  (ii)  international  best  practice  in  securities  market  regulation  and \nsupervision  as  reflected  in  the  objectives  and  principles  of  the  International  Organization  of \nSecurities Commissions; (iii) ongoing or planned policy, legal, and regulatory reform initiatives of \nthe  Government;  and  (iv)  proposals  formulated  under  a  number  of  stakeholder  initiatives, \nincluding  (a)  the  Working  Group  on  Debt  Market  and  Commercial  Paper,  (b)  the  Debt  Capital \nMarket  Committee,  (c)  the  Task  Force  on  Review  of  Tax  Laws  of  Holding  Companies,  and \n(d) an ongoing private sector initiative to establish the Securities Institute of Pakistan (SIP). The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix for the Program are in Appendix 4. A program of this \nnature  requires  sound  macroeconomic  underpinning.  On  ADB\u2019s  request,  the  International \nMonetary Fund has provided a summary assessment of recent macroeconomic developments, \nwhich is presented in Appendix 5. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n1. \n\nSupport the Development of Institutional Investors to Facilitate Long-Term \nCapital Formation \n\na. \n\nEstablish an Enabling Environment for Private Pension Funds \n\n65. \nUnder the Program, SECP is to (i) establish a regulatory framework, including prudential \nstandards  and  implementation  guidelines,  for  a  voluntary  private  pension  scheme  (VPS),  and \n(ii) authorize  qualified  financial  companies  to  offer  VPS  to  their  clients.  The  regulatory \nframework  will  ensure  investor  protection.  Further,  the  Government  is  to  broaden  the  base  of \neligible  VPS  participants  to  individuals  beyond  those  with  a  national  tax  number  (estimated  at \n1.6 million) to enhance the outreach of the VPS. Making all national identity cardholders eligible, \nfor  instance,  could  help  to  include  individuals  working  outside  the  country  (estimated  at  6 \nmillion) or in areas that are tax exempt such as agriculture. Broadening the base of the VPS is \nnot  only  desirable  from  a  social  protection  point  of  view;  it  would  also  significantly  increase \ncapital mobilization and the business viability of the VPS. \n\nBased on a review (with ADB TA) of existing employer-sponsored occupational pension \n66. \nschemes,  SECP  will  issue  best  practice  guidelines  for  such  schemes  under  the  Program.  In \ndoing so, SECP will benefit from its experience in establishing the VPS framework.  \n\nTo expand the range of shares for investment by private pension funds, the Government \n67. \nis to offer SOE shares in the form of block sales to private pension funds, as is current practice \nwith  other  institutional  investors.  Making  SOE  shares,  which  are  typically  oversubscribed, \navailable for pension funds will provide additional incentives to the population for embarking into \nlong-term  contractual  saving  through  participation  in  private  pension  schemes,  and  help  to \nreduce market volatility by facilitating long-term institutional investment in shares. \n\nb. \n\nSupport the Development of Domestic Institutional Investors \n\n68. \nUnder the Program, the Government is to clarify SECP\u2019s legal mandate for its powers, \nfunctions,  and  responsibilities  over  nonbank  financial  companies  and  their  services.  As  an \nintermediate  solution,  the  Government  will  make  amendments  to  the  Company  Ordinance  to \nempower SECP to regulate mutual funds and strengthen SECP\u2019s powers to establish prudential \nrequirements  for  nonbank  financial  companies.  Subsequently,  SECP  will  be  able  to  actually \nstrengthen  prudential  requirements  by  amending  the  2005  rules  for  nonbank  financial \ncompanies. Amendments have already been drafted and discussed with the industry. \n\n69. \nFurther  under  the  Program,  the  Government  will  draft  (with  ADB  TA)  and  submit  to \nParliament  a  distinct  nonbank  financial  companies  law.  Provisions  for  mutual  funds  could  be \nincluded in this law or, alternatively, in the Securities Law, given their importance for securities \nmarkets. Providing a solid legal foundation for the regulation and supervision of mutual funds is \nparticularly important given the planned privatization of NIT, which will substantially increase the \nassets  managed  by  private  mutual  funds.  NIT  privatization  is  an  important  objective  of  the \nGovernment under the Program, since it will  significantly accelerate competition in the mutual \nfund industry. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n \n\n2. \n\nImprove  the  Efficiency  of  Securities  Markets  to  Optimize  the  Allocation  of \nFinancial Resources \n\na. \n\nFacilitate the Development of Corporate Bond Markets \n\n70. \nSECP established the Working Group on Debt Market and Commercial Paper in March \n2005  and  the  Debt  Capital  Market  Committee  in  June  2006,  both  with  broad  stakeholder \nparticipation.  The  objective  of  these  initiatives  was  to  identify  bond  market  development \nconstraints and formulate proposals to address them. Under the Program the Government is to \ndisseminate  the  report  of  the  Debt  Capital  Market  Committee,  which  includes  key  proposals \nmade  by  the  Working  Group  on  Debt  Market  and  Commercial  Paper.  This  will  help  to  build \nbroad-based consensus about needed reforms. Subsequently, the Government is to implement \nkey proposals formulated by these stakeholder initiatives (paras. 71\u201376). \n\n71.  MOF and SBP are to build a benchmark yield curve for corporate bonds to include yields \nof treasury bills and PIBs by standardizing their terms and issuing them at regular intervals. The \namounts and maturities should be determined by market conditions and the Government\u2019s debt \nmanagement policy. The liquidity of the yield-curve should be enhanced over time by increasing \nthe amounts of individual issues. \n\nThe Government is also recommended to work with provincial authorities to reduce the \n72. \ncost of issuing corporate securities by lowering the stamp duties for corporate bonds. This will \nreduce  (or  even  eliminate,  if  the  duty  is  reduced  to  zero)  a  policy  distortion  that  discriminates \ncorporate  bonds  against  bank  credits.  Lowering  stamp  duties  on  corporate  bonds  will  tend  to \nincrease  the  number  of  corporate  bond  issues  and  lengthen  their  maturity.  This  will  have  a \nsignificant  positive  impact  on  economic  development  in  general  and  private-sector-financed \ninfrastructure development in particular. \n\nSECP  is  to  abolish  the  regulatory  requirement  for  public  corporate  bond  issues  to  be \n73. \nlisted on a stock exchange. Abolishing the listing requirement reduces the cost of issuing bonds, \nand  should  significantly  increase  the  number  of  issues.  The  policy  action  does  not  have  any \nnegative  implications:  Despite  the  current  requirement  to  list  at  the  formal  over-the-counter \nmarket, no corporate bonds are actually traded at this market. Abolishing the listing requirement \ndoes  not  suggest  that  greater  liquidity  of  a  secondary  market  for  corporate  bonds  is  not \ndesirable. However, greater liquidity cannot be artificially induced by policies that do not reflect \nmarket conditions and fail to acknowledge the characteristics of corporate bonds compared with \nequity:  Corporate  bonds  normally  are  priced  at  a  premium  over  a  risk-free  rate  of  return  of \nbenchmark  debt  instruments  with  comparable  maturities,  while  share  prices  are  determined \nprimarily by company-specific information.  \n\nFurther,  SECP  is  to  introduce  shelf-registration  procedures  for  securities.  Corporate \n74. \nbond  issues  should  be  allowed  for  registration  for  at  least  one  year,  during  which  issuers  can \nobtain funds when market conditions are favorable.  \n\nFinally,  the  Government  is  recommended  to  establish  an  enabling  environment  for  the \n75. \ncreation of a limited secondary market among qualified institutional buyers for privately placed \ncorporate  bonds.  Given  their  lower  cost  of  issue  and  regulatory  requirement,  the  number  and \ntotal volume of such private placements is estimated to be higher than those of publicly issued \nbonds.  Allowing  limited  trading  in  these  instruments  would  increase  the  amount  of  assets \navailable  to  institutional  investors,  which  would  reduce  their  dependence  on  investing  in  non-\ntradable  NSS  instruments.  Trading  should  be  limited  to  qualified  institutional  buyers  with  the \ncapacity and sophistication to assess the risks involved in investing in privately placed bonds. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAs  a  second  step,  the  Government  is  asked  to  issue  tradable  Government  bonds \n76. \nthrough the NSS wide branch network, which will provide retail investors throughout the country \nwith  a  means  for  accumulating  long-term  savings  through  investment  in  higher-yielding \ngovernment  bonds.  The  measure  will  have  the  additional  benefit  of  increasing  the  volume  of \ngovernment  securities  in  circulation,  which  would,  in  turn,  help  to  achieve  the  objective  of \ndeveloping a benchmark yield curve. To provide incentives for institutional (and other) investors \nto  invest  into  tradable  instruments,  the  Government  will  ensure  a  lower  rate  of  return  for  non-\ntradable NSS instruments as compared with that of tradable Government bonds.  \n\nb. \n\nIncrease Equity Market Breath and Reduce its Volatility \n\n77. \nUnder  the  Program,  the  Government  is  asked  to  continue  the  exemption  from  capital \ngains  tax  on  income  earned  from  individual  investment  in  shares  to  facilitate long-term  capital \nformation.  To  reduce  the  high  volume  of  speculative  short-term  investment  by  individuals,  the \nGovernment is to introduce a turnover tax on such investment.  \n\nFurther,  the  Government  is  asked  to  develop,  with  ADB  TA,  a  policy  for  SOE \n78. \nprivatization  through  stock  exchanges.  Such  privatization  should  take  into  account  market \nconditions and investor demand, and the need to achieve a balance between shares offered in \ninternational financial centers and shares offered domestically. The policy should be disclosed \nto the public to increase transparency. The potential benefits of a more capital market oriented \nprivatization  approach  include  (i)  higher  prices  for  shares  and,  thus,  higher  budget  revenues, \nsince  investors  will  tend  to  pay  more  for  shares  if  they  have  a  credible  expectation  that \nadditional packages will be offered in the foreseeable future up to a specified minimum total of \nshares; (ii) increased market liquidity and lower volatility through a significant increase in supply \nof shares, which should facilitate overall capital market development, (iii) improved performance \nof enterprise managers by introducing market discipline to companies even if they are still partly \nstate owned; and (iv) limiting the scope for corruption by increasing transparency of privatization \nand  reducing  discretion  of  civil  servants  involved.  The  policy  will  also  allow  the  Privatization \nCommission to offer SOE shares through a book building process in line with international best \npractices  to  domestic  institutional  buyers  and  allow  the  use  of  shelf-registrations  procedures, \nwhich will increase the efficiency of the process. \n\n79. \nIn developing a more stock-market-oriented privatization approach, the Government will \nbe  assisted  by  ADB  in  taking  the  experience  of  other  counties  into  account,  specifically  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. \n\n3. \n\nStrengthen  the  Governance  of  Capital  Markets  to \nTransparency and Protect Investors \n\nImprove  Market \n\na. \n\nStrengthen the Institutional Framework for Sector Supervision \n\n80. \nUnder the Program SECP is to be converted into the Financial Services Commission of \nPakistan  (FSCP)  in  charge  of  regulation  and  supervision  of  NBFIs  by  clearly  codifying  its \npowers,  functions,  governance,  and  accountability  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  In \nrecent  years,  financial  sector  regulatory  bodies  have  been  granted  greater  independence  in \nmany  countries  to  ensure  that  they  can  professionally  perform  their  statutory  functions  in  the \npublic  interest  and  be  largely  free  from  political  interference.  An  agency  responsible  for \nregulation and supervision of NBFIs and markets should, in general, have authority and capacity \ncomparable to that of the agency in charge of banking (and for similar reasons). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n \n\nintermediaries, \n\nThe Government is asked to draft and submit to Parliament a law codifying the FSCP. \n81. \nThis  law  would  establish  FSCP,  based  on  SECP,  and  strengthen  its  enforcement  powers  by \nenhancing  its  independence,  governance,  and  accountability.  The  law  should  be  a  framework \nlaw that incorporates by reference to sector-specific laws (such as the laws governing securities \nfinancial \ninsurance,  private  pension \nmarkets  and \ncompanies)  FSCP\u2019s  powers  to  administer  those  laws.  The  establishment  of  FSCP  does  not \npreclude  further  integration  of  responsibility  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  banking  and \nnonbanking  financial  services  at  a  later  date  (for  which  the  framework  law  would  have  to  be \namended).  However,  given  the  substantive  capacity  building  needs  to  establish  a  fully \nconsolidated financial sector agency and the considerable transaction cost typically involved in \nmerging  regulatory  agencies  with  different  cultures  and  capacity,  this  would  be  beyond  the \nscope of the Program. \n\nfunds,  and  nonbank \n\n82. \nGiven the urgency of a suitable governance arrangement for SECP, particularly for recruiting \nand  retaining  qualified  staff  and  senior  personnel,  the  Government  is  to  strengthen  SECP\u2019s \ngovernance in the short term under existing law. SECP is to move to competitive remuneration for \nsenior officers to fill all existing positions. Further, SECP is asked to designate specific positions for \ncommissioners  responsible  for  law,  and  accounting  and  auditing,  given  the  importance  of  these \nareas for effective financial sector regulation and supervision. Furthermore, another commissioner \nshould be charged with assessing the economic impact of regulatory initiatives.  \n\n83. \nToward the end of the Program, FSCP is recommended to undertake a self-assessment \nof  compliance  with  international  best  practices  in  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  securities \nmarkets  and  private  pension  funds.  This  assessment  could  provide  the  basis  for  formulating \nanother round of policy reforms to address remaining weaknesses, if any. \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen the Governance of Securities Markets, Market \nProfessionals, and Public Issuers \n\ni. \n\nFinancial Groups \n\n84. \nThe  Program  recognizes  the  potential  use  of  a  holding  company  to  achieve  both \nbusiness and regulatory objectives. The Program also acknowledges the Government\u2019s initiative \nto establish a task force to review the enabling environment for holding companies with special \nemphasis on their taxation, undertake stakeholder consultations, and formulate proposals in line \nwith  international  best  practices  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  holding  companies.  The  Program \nsupports  a  sequenced  approach  to  facilitating  the  formation  of  holding  companies  and \nsubsequently  using  them  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  financial  sector \nregulation  and  supervision.  This  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of  financial  groups  and \nreduce systemic risks in the financial sector of Pakistan.  \n\n85. \nUnder the Program, the Government is to address tax policies that impede the formation \nof holding companies, as proposed by the task force. This will encourage the establishment of \nholding companies, including financial institutions, to facilitate sound risk management practices \nand supervision. Further, SECP (FSCP) will adopt regulations on the reporting requirements of \nholding  companies  that  own  or  control  NBFIs.  The  reporting  should  comprise  (i)  ownership \nstructure  and  relationship  of  companies  within  the  holding  company  group,  (ii)  disclosure  of \nintercompany  and  related  party  transactions;  and  (iii)  public  disclosure  of  audited  financial \nreports in accordance with international accounting standards. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nii. \n\nSecurities Law \n\n86. \nTo facilitate investor protection and capital formation, the Securities Ordinance of 1969 \nneeds  to  be  replaced  with  a  new  substantive  law  that  provides  a  legal  framework  for  modern \nsecurities markets. SECP has to be mandated with adequate legal powers and responsibilities \nfor  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  securities  markets  and  intermediaries,  private \nplacements, public offers of listed and unlisted securities, corporate governance practices, and \nrelated matters, in line with international best practices. \n\n87. \nFurther,  the  law  would  introduce  the  concept  of  \u201cbest  efforts\u201d  (para.  49)  and  other \nunderwriting commitment. This should substantially increase the number of IPOs. The concept \nof underwriting should be broadened to recognize that the modern capital market demands the \nflexibility to offer either firm commitment underwritings or \u201cbest efforts\u201d placements of securities. \nThe concept of \u201cbest efforts\u201d has been international best practice for many years. This concept \nsignificantly  reduces  the  risk  of  investment  banks  in  managing  issues,  particularly  IPOs.  With \n\u201cbest  efforts\u201d,  the  pricing  of  IPOs  in  Pakistan  would  tend  to  strike  a  fair  balance  between  the \ninterests of the issuer and the potential investor without being twisted by risk considerations of \nthe  lead  manager.  Prices  would  tend  to  be  higher,  which  should,  in  turn,  make  IPOs  more \nattractive for a larger number of companies. \n\nFurthermore, the law would introduce a class of publicly tradable companies and require \n88. \nall such companies, listed and unlisted, to comply with comparable governance and disclosure \nrequirements. This would eliminate the possibility of regulatory arbitrage and its harmful effects \nin the form of disincentives for listing and undermining investor protection. The class of publicly \ntradable  companies  would  include  all  companies  with  significant  public  shareholding  and \npotential to issue securities, i.e., those companies on which the regulation and supervision is to \nfocus. As a result of these legal (and supporting regulatory) reforms, a significant increase in the \nnumber of newly listed companies can be expected. \n\n89. \nFurther under the Program, SECP (FSCP) is to issue guidelines on obtaining information \nabout  unlisted  publicly  tradable  companies.  Stock  exchanges  will  continue  to  provide  on  their \nwebsites  disclosed  information  of  listed  companies.  Therefore,  investors  will  have  a  better \naccess  to  annual  reports  and  other  disclosed  information  of  both  listed  and  unlisted  publicly \ntradable companies, which will enhance transparency and efficiency of the capital market. \n\n90. \nFinally,  the  Government  is  to  grant  SECP  (FSCP)  the  power  to  approve  or  disapprove \naudit  firms  authorized  to  audit  nonbank  financial  companies  licensed  by  SECP  (FSCP),  listed \ncompanies, and publicly tradable companies. This will strengthen SECP\u2019s (FSCP\u2019s) capability to \nensure  quality  and  consistency  in  the  financial  information  available  to  investors  and  the \nregulator. \n\niii. \n\nSecurities Institute of Pakistan \n\n91. \nThe Government is to support the completion of a feasibility study for the creation of SIP, \nwhich  is  currently  being  undertaken  by  the  Center  for  International  Private  Enterprise  in \nPakistan. The study is to explore opportunities for establishing this institute as a nongovernment \ninstitution  by  industry  associations  and  other  private  sector  stakeholders.  SIP  would  aim  to \nincrease professional standards and qualifications among securities market professional. SECP \nis  recommended  to  financially  support  SIP  given  SIP\u2019s  potentially  significant  contribution  in \nhelping to reduce violation of laws and regulations through certification of professionals, training, \nand other measures. ADB TA will also assist in building SIP capacity (para. 108). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n \n\nFurther  under  the  Program,  SECP  (FSCP)  is  also  recommended  to  develop,  together \n92. \nwith SIP, a certification system for professional market participants who have completed training \ncourses  delivered  by  SIP.  All  securities  brokers  and  mutual  fund  sales  agents  dealing  with \npublic customers should ultimately be certified by examination. As a supportive measure, SECP \nis  to  publish  for  comment  on  its  website  a  new  code  of  conduct  for  brokers.  This  new  code \nwould replace the existing code annexed to the Brokers and Agents Registration Rules (2001), \nand should be part of the SIP curriculum. \n\niv. \n\nGovernance of Stock Exchanges \n\n93. \nThe  new  Securities  Law  would  grant  SECP  (FSCP)  authority  to  require  a  unified  national \nmarket  system  in  securities  that  may  include  one  or  more  securities  exchanges  and  alternative \ntrading platforms. Such a national market system can be created through systematic exchange of \ninformation between various trading platforms in combination with legal and regulatory requirements \nfor brokers. The system would provide for the public exposure of customer orders for the purchase \nand sale of shares to provide maximum opportunity to achieve best execution of customer orders. \n\n94. \nUnder  the  Program,  SECP  is  to  enhance  market  transparency  and  best  execution  of \ncustomer  orders  by  requiring  the  stock  exchanges  to  establish  an  intermarket  surveillance \ncommittee.  The  committee  would  meet  regularly  to  coordinate  stock  market  surveillance  and \noversight  of  securities  that  are  traded  on  more  than  one  stock  exchange  and  would,  thus, \ninstitutionalize coordination (and potentially cooperation) between the exchanges. \n\n95. \nFurther, the stock exchanges are recommended to prepare plans for self-regulation for \nSECP  (FSCP)  approval.  These  plans  would  identify  the  functions  to  be  performed  by  the \nexchanges  in  their  capacity  as  self-regulatory  organizations  under  the  Securities  Law,  and \nclearly  define  subplans  for  areas  such  as  listed  companies,  market  surveillance,  and  on-  and \noff-site  inspections  of  professional  market  participants.  These  subplans  should  lead  to  the \nadherence to sound business practices and applicable laws and regulations, including financial \nresponsibility  requirements  and  quality  of  execution  of  trades  on  behalf  of  customers.  They \nshould also include budget estimates of the cost (and capacity) of regulatory compliance. \n\nToward  the  end  of  the  Program,  SECP  (FSCP)  is  to  conduct  public  consultations  to \n96. \nidentify remaining anticompetitive rules and regulations that undermine the creation of a national \nmarket system.16  \n\nC. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n97. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  undertake  the  reforms  and  meet  the  Government\u2019s  financing  requirements. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n                                                 \n16  This  would,  for  instance,  comprise  rules  that  prevent  brokers  of  one  exchange  from  making  price  information \navailable to participants of another exchange, which is a key constraint to the establishment of a transparent and \nefficient national market system. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe following factors were considered in determining the loan size: the importance of the \n98. \nsector for sustaining economic growth, the strength of the Program and the financial and political \ncosts  associated  with  implementing  it,  and  the  Government\u2019s  overall  development  financing \nneeds. Capital market development is a key element of the Government\u2019s reform agenda given its \nimportance  for  resource  mobilization  and  intermediation,  investment  finance,  and  employment \ngeneration.  The  financial  and  political  costs  associated  with  program  implementation  are  not \neasily  quantifiable  given  the  nature  of  the  Program.  These  costs  will,  however,  be  substantial, \ngiven  the  scope  of  reforms  supported  under  the  Program,  including  (i)  tax  policy  reforms; \n(ii) comprehensive legal reforms; (iii) the need to achieve and sustain broad-based consensus on \nprivatization-related  issues;  (iv)  step-by-step  privatization  through  the  stock  exchange  that  may \nresult  in  lower  budget  revenues  from  privatization  in  the  short  and  medium  term,  despite \nmaximizing proceeds in the long term; and (v) comprehensive capacity building for the FSCP. The \nprivate  sector  will  also  incur  substantial  adjustment  costs  for  complying  with  stricter  regulatory \nrequirements,  particularly  with  regard  to  prudential  requirements,  including  capital  requirements, \nand  financial  disclosure  and  governance  requirements  for  NBFIs  and  issuers  of  securities.  The \nGovernment\u2019s overall development needs are reflected in the Government\u2019s budget for FY2007\u2013\n2008 and its medium-term budgetary framework.17    \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n99.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program.  SECP  (FSCP)  and  the  Ministry  of \nPrivatization  will  be  implementing  agencies.  The  financial  management  arrangements  are \nassessed  as  adequate.  Accumulated  experience  in  implementing  a  large  number  of  program \nloans  demonstrates  MOF\u2019s  proven  competence  and  capacity  to  effectively  carry  out  financial \nmanagement of the Program.  \n\n100.  The Government will establish a program coordination unit in MOF, staffed with two or \nthree  officials.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  program  implementation  to  ensure  that  the  envisaged \noutputs are achieved.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n101.  The Program will be implemented over 2 years. It will be completed by 30 June 2009.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n\n102.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  6)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Pakistan as the Borrower in accordance \nwith the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements \nfor program loans. Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports on the basis of \na  certificate  provided  by  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of \nPakistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  a  particular  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of \nloan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\n                                                 \n17  Government  of  Pakistan,  Central  Board  of  Revenues.  2006.

Islamabad. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Measures \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n \n\n103.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Program  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n\n104.  The Program incorporates key elements of good governance and anticorruption policies \nby  increasing  transparency  of  decision  making,  improving  accountability  and  stakeholder \nrepresentation,  and  limiting  opportunities  for  discretionary  decision-making.  The  Program  will \nhelp to fight corruption by (i) strengthening the independence, accountability, and transparency \nof  the  regulatory  body  in  charge  of  securities  markets;  and  (ii)  increasing  the  transparency  of \nSOE privatization through a capital market privatization policy.  \n \n\n5. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n105.  The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the program loan \nare  used  (i)  first,  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and  implemented \nunder  the  Program;  and  (ii)  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  Government\u2019s  general \ndevelopment purposes. \n \n\n6. \n\nTranches \n\nthe \n\nfollowing  satisfaction  of \n\n106.  The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $200 million will become \navailable \nloan \neffectiveness. The second tranche of $200 million will be released subject to the Government\u2019s \nsatisfaction of  second  tranche  conditions  (i.e.,  the  bolded  actions  set  forth  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 4); this release is expected to take place 6-18 months after first tranche release. In \naddition,  the  Government  must  complete  all  the  actions  to  be  monitored  (listed  in  the  policy \nmatrix) during the program period. While these actions are not conditions for the release of the \nfirst or second tranches, they are crucial steps toward achieving the program objectives. \n\ntranche  release  conditions  and  after \n\nfirst \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Reporting \n\nimplementation, \n\n107.  MOF  will  (i)  establish  within  3  months  after  loan  effectiveness  and  maintain  a \nperformance evaluation system for the Program, which will include a database on the status of \npolicy  measures  and  program  indicators  based  on  the  policy  matrix;  (ii)  monitor  the \nimplementation of the Program and its impacts; and (iii) submit reports to ADB semiannually on \nprogram \nthe \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix. ADB  will monitor program  implementation through \nregular  reviews  and  progress  reports  throughout  implementation.  Based  on  these  reviews, \nmodifications and improvements will be considered. To facilitate such reviews, the Government \nwill  assist  ADB  by  providing  relevant  data  and  information  in  such  detail  as  ADB  may \nreasonably  request.  Approximately  6  weeks  before  the  anticipated  withdrawal  of  the  second \ntranche,  ADB  will  undertake  a  review  of  progress  made  in  implementing  the  policy  reforms \nunder the Program.  \n\nincluding  accomplishment  of \n\nthe  measures  set \n\nforth \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n108.  The  TA  for  Supporting  the  Second  Generation  of  Capital  Market  Reform  Program  will \nhelp the Government implement the reforms called for under the Program. In particular, the TA \nwill focus on (i) raising professional standards among market participants by supporting the SIP, \n(ii)  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  institutional  investors,  and  (iii) \nenhancing the strategic planning capacity of the Ministry of Privatization. \n\n109.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,340,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000  on  a \ngrant  basis.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  of  $340,000  equivalent  will  cover  training  experts, \ntraining and workshop facilities, office accommodation, and counterpart support. Procurement of \ngoods  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as \namended from time to time).  \n\n110.  SECP will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Ministry of Privatization and SIP will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  2.5  years,  starting  in  August \n2007.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  require  107  person-months  of  consulting  services:  14  person-\nmonths  by  international  consultants  and  93  person-months  by  national  consultants.  All \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The key activities, \ncost estimates, and outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 7. \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n111.  The  Program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment and employment generation by supporting the development of corporate bond and \nequity capital markets in Pakistan. The Program will help to ensure a balanced development of \nthe  financial  sector,  which  will  reduce  systemic  vulnerabilities  in  the  bank-dominated  financial \nsystem. Specific benefits are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBy  addressing  policy  and  regulatory  constraints  to  the  issues  of  corporate \nsecurities, the Program will help to significantly increase the number of corporate \nbond  and  equity  issues,  both  primary  and  secondary.  This  will  facilitate  the \nmobilization  of  financial  resources  for  long-term  private  sector  investment, \nincluding  infrastructure  investment,  which  requires  long-term  debt  finance \nthrough bonds.  \nBy  strengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  private  pension  funds  and  other \ninstitutional  investors,  the  Program  will  facilitate  capital  mobilization  through \ncontractual savings. This is not only beneficial with regard to increasing old age \nincome security. Pension reform is also a catalyst for increasing local institutional \ninvestment and asset diversification, resulting in improved allocation of financial \nsavings. \nBy  promoting  the  development  of  corporate  securities  markets  and  institutional \ninvestors, thereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor \nbase, the Program will reduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the \nfinancial and enterprise sectors to external shocks.   \nBy strengthening regulatory and market conduct governance in capital markets, \nthe  Program  will  enhance  market  efficiency  and  transparency,  and  improve \ninvestor  protection.  The  establishment  and  institutional  strengthening  of  FSCP \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nand  SIP,  and  strengthening  the  self-regulatory  function  of stock  exchanges,  will \nprovide these benefits. \nBy  addressing  tax  policy  constraints  to  the  formation  of  holding  companies  that \ninclude  financial  institutions,  the  Program  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of \nfinancial  groups  and  the  effectiveness  of  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  in  line  with  international  best  practices,  which  will,  in  turn,  reduce \nsystemic risks.  \nBy  supporting  a  more  capital  market-oriented  privatization  policy,  the  Program \nwill  (a)  help  to  increase  budget  revenues,  since  investors  will  tend  to  pay  more \nfor shares if an individual offer is embedded in a transparent and credible overall \nprivatization strategy; (b) support capital market development by reducing market \nvolatility  through  increased  liquidity;  and  (c)  improve  the  performance  of \nenterprises  by  introducing  market  discipline  to  companies  even  if  they  are  still \npartly state owned.  \n\n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n112.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is in Appendix 8. The \nProgram is an integral component of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Pakistan18 whose \noverall  objective  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  promoting  private-sector-led  economic  growth.  The \nProgram  supports  corporate  bond  market  development.  This  will  facilitate  the  financing  of \ninfrastructure projects, which require long-term finance in the form of bonds. Enhanced private \nsector  infrastructure  finance  supports  poverty  reduction  goals  by  helping  to  provide  the \npopulation with infrastructure services and freeing up public resources needed to provide social \nservices.  Further,  the  Program  supports  the  development  of  institutional  investors.  This  will \nallow  low-income  groups  to  enter  into  well-regulated  and  protected  contractual  savings \nschemes. The outreach of the new contractual savings schemes, particularly the new pension \nproducts,  will  be  countrywide,  i.e.,  include  rural  areas  where  the  poor  are  concentrated. \nFurthermore, the Program helps to strengthen the governance of NBFIs and markets. This will \nincrease  market  transparency  and  improve  the  protection  of  investors  against  fraud,  which  is \nparticularly important for unsophisticated investors, including vulnerable parts of the population. \nAs  such,  the  Program  is  pro-poor  in  its  indirect  impact  in  the  short  and  medium  term.  No \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected from implementation of the \nProgram  (category  C).  The  environmental  implications  of  the  Program  were  assessed,  and  no \nsignificant  adverse  impact  was  identified.  Both  fall  under  category  C  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nclassification system.  \n\nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n113.  Macroeconomic  stability  is  essential  for  financial  sector  development  in  general,  and \nbond  market  development  and  contractual  saving  schemes  in  particular.  Macroeconomic  risks \nare mitigated by prudent fiscal and monetary policies and high expected economic growth rates. \nThe Program has to assume that Pakistan will not suffer from any adverse geopolitical changes \naffecting  its  external  and  internal  stability.  Furthermore,  the  Program  assumes  that  the \nGovernment  will  remain  strongly  committed  to  its  second  generation  of  capital  market  reform \nprogram,  which  is  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  for \n2005\u20132010. The presidential elections scheduled for late 2007 may result in policy changes in \nsome  areas.  However,  economic  policies  are  unlikely  to  be  fundamentally  changed,  given  the \nhigh  degree  of  continuity  in  economic  policy  making  in  Pakistan  over  the  last  decade  and  a \nbroad consensus for economic reforms, including financial sector reform. \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update: Pakistan 2006\u20132008. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n114.  Another risk is that draft legislation will be enacted with substantial delays and/or not in \nline  with  international  best  practice  due  to  vested  interest  and  lack  of  understanding  by \nlawmakers. To minimize this risk, legislative changes related to the Program were drafted during \nprogram  preparation  or  will  be  drafted  under  the  TA  to  ensure  quality  of  the  legislation.  In \naddition,  TA  will  be  provided  to  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  and  sustaining \nstakeholder consultations. \n \n115.  The Program supports SECP (FSCP) in playing its primary role in instilling and overseeing \nthe  implementation  of  good  governance  practices  by  financial  institutions.  However,  good \nregulatory  governance  cannot  be  sustained  without  good  public  sector  governance  in  general. \nThe latter includes the absence of corruption, a sound approach to competitions policies, effective \nlegal  and  judicial  systems,  and  an  arm\u2019s-length  approach  to  government  ownership.  Successful \ncontinuation  of  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  and  private  sector  development  policies  is \ntherefore a critical assumption for accomplishing the Program\u2019s objectives. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n116. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe policies adopted and actions described in the development policy letter and \ntaken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  will  continue  in  effect  for  the \nduration of the Program and subsequently. \n\nThe Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nindicated  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the \npolicy matrix, and ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect during \nand after the program period. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nVIII.

markets  (especially  money,  foreign  exchange,  and  capital \nmarkets) are integral parts of a vibrant financial system. While money markets provide financial \nintermediaries an avenue to borrow and lend short-term funds, foreign exchange markets are a \nkey  element  of  the  enabling  environment  for  international  trade.  Capital  markets  provide  long-\nterm  finance  for  the  corporate  sector  (and  the  government).  The  growth  and  development  of \nwell-functioning capital markets, including markets for equity and long-term debt capital (bonds), \nconvey  significant  economic  benefits.  They  provide  efficient  savings  vehicles  for  retail  and \ninstitutional  investors  that  help  to  diversify  their  financial  holdings  and  facilitate  resource \nmobilization  for  productive  investments.  Further,  an  increased  diversity  of  funding  sources  for \ncorporations makes the corporate and financial sector more robust to shocks. \n \n2. \nPakistan has made progress with capital market reforms since 1998, when a year-long \neconomic  and  financial  crisis  culminated  in  a  crash  of  the  capital  market.  The  regulatory  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  the  capital  market  has  been  strengthened,  the  financial  health  of \nailing  financial  institutions  restored,  a  large  number  of  state-owned  institutions  privatized,  and \ncompetition  invigorated.  In  spite  of  this,  domestic  capital  markets  do  not  yet  play  a  significant \nrole  in  resource  mobilization.  However,  the  basis  has  been  laid  for  a  second  round  of  capital \nmarket reforms that aim at turning domestic equity and bond markets into a relevant source for \nlong-term finance. \n \nA. \n\nInstitutions and Structure \n\n \n\nThe capital market of Pakistan comprises three stock exchanges, National Clearing and \n3. \nSettlement System, Central Depositary Company, about 300 brokers, and two rating agencies. \nFurther,  it  has  many  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs),  including  (as  of  June  2006)  40 \nmutual  funds;  8  investment  banks  (investment  financial  institutions),  which  also  engage  in \nbrokerage  activities;  3  venture  capital  companies;  5  development  financial  institutions;1  20 \nleasing companies; 31 moderabas, which offer shariah compliant financial services;2 3 housing \nfinance  companies;  and  3  discount  houses.  Furthermore,  54  insurance  companies  play  an \nincreasing  role  as  institutional  investors.  The  state-owned  Central  Directorate  of  National \nSavings  is  the  biggest  institutional  investor  in  the  country,  followed  by  State  Life  Insurance \nCompany and Employee\u2019s Old Age Benefits Institution. \n \n4. \nOf the more than 44,000 registered companies, almost 2,800 are public, i.e., have more \nthan  50  shareholders,  and  more  than  700  are  listed  at  one  or  several  stock  exchanges.  Only \nlisted companies can make public issues of securities. Listed debt securities must be rated. \n \n5. \nAll three stock exchanges are fully private and mutually owned by their members, who \nare brokers.3 However, in April 2005 the Islamabad and Lahore stock exchanges approved an \naction  plan  for  demutualization  and  partial  integration  of  their  trading  platforms.  Karachi  Stock \nExchange  also  decided  to  demutualize  but  does  not  plan  to  integrate  with  the  other  two \nexchanges. The various demutualization plans foresee establishing a ceiling for shareholding by \n\n                                                 \n1  All development financial institutions are foreign sponsored with the exception of the Pakistan Industrial Credit and \n\nInvestment Corporation.  \n\n2  The term modaraba implies a contract between two parties, whereby one party entrusts money to the other party to \nuse its management expertise and utilize the funds in an agreed manner. Profits of the modaraba are shared in a \npreagreed  ratio  and  losses  in  the  proportion  of  the  capital  invested.  The  majority  of  the  modarabas  are  in  the \nfinancial sector, although no restrictions are placed on the nature of business. \n\n3  Apart  from  individual  brokers,  Pakistan  has  a  number  of  large  brokerage  houses.  Investment  banks  also  offer \n\nbrokerage services. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n \n\n33 \n\nbrokers  and  offering  shares  to  other  stakeholders,  including  banks.  The  target  date  for \ndemutualization is the end of 2007.4 Preparations are well under way. \n \n6. \nOver the last 5 years, NBFIs in Pakistan have transformed rapidly through restructuring \nand improved supervision. Regulatory policies focusing on consolidating weak institutions have \nresulted  in  many  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Further,  some  companies  were  absorbed  by \ncommercial banks, others discontinued operations. As a result, the number of all types of NBFIs \ndeclined with the exception of mutual funds. Mutual funds and development financial institutions \ndominate the sector now with a combined share in total assets of 41% (Figure A2.1). Insurance \ncompanies account for about 34% of NBFI assets.  \n \n\nFigure A1.1: Relative Size of Nonbank Financial Institutions\n\n(in terms of assets, June 2006)\n\nInsurance, 34.2% \n\nMutual Funds, 23.1% \n\nVenture Capital, 0.5% \n\nDevelopment Financial  \nInstitutions, 18.2% \n\nDiscount Houses \n0.3% \n\nLeasing, 91% \n\n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\nModerabas, 3.6%\n\nInvestment Banks, 7.8%\n\nHousing \nFinance, \n3.2%\n\n \n7. \nGovernment-owned NBFIs accounted for about 41% of NBFI total assets in June 2006, \ndown  from  64%  in  June  2001.  This  decline  was  mainly  caused  by  (i)  the  liquidation  of  state-\nowned development financial institutions or their merger with banks, and (ii) the privatization of \n(closed-end)  state-owned  mutual  funds.5  However,  the  Government  still  owns  a  significant \nproportion  of  (open-end)  mutual  funds,  a  large  proportion  of  the  insurance  industry,  and  the \ndominating housing finance company. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The  1996  Securities  and  Exchange  Ordinance,  as  amended  through  the  2006  Finance  Act,  requires  stock \nexchanges to corporatize and demutualize by 31 December 2006 or a later date as specified by the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan, which has extended the date for demutualization to 31 December 2007. \n\n5  The  share  of  government-owned  mutual  funds  in  total  assets  of  mutual  funds  declined  from  above  90%  in  June \n2001  to  about  50%  in  June  2005.  This  was  primarily  the  result  of  the  privatization  of  funds  managed  by  the \nInvestment Corporation of Pakistan in fiscal year 2003.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\nIn June 2006, state-owned mutual funds accounted for 51% of total assets of the mutual \n8. \nfund  industry,  down  from  91%  in  2001.  Although  open-end  mutual  funds  still  dominate  the \nmarket  (72%  of  assets),  closed-end  funds  have  gained  ground  since  2001.  The  National \nInvestment Trust Limited is the largest open-end mutual fund in Pakistan with assets of about \n$1.1 billion equivalent under management. The Government owns 8% of its shares directly and \nanother 33% indirectly through other government controlled entities. \n \n9. \nAs  in  many  developing  countries,  the  insurance  subsector  in  Pakistan  has  remained \ndormant. Life insurance accounts for almost 66% of insurance assets. Insurance is dominated \nby  state-owned  companies,  which  account  for  77%  of  total  assets,  down  from  84%  in  2001. \nState Life Insurance Company accounts for 75% of the insurance premiums in the country. \n \nBanks are increasingly engaged in the capital market as issuer, investor, and provider of \n10. \ninvestment  banking  services.  A  number  of  banks  have  established  investment  banking \ndepartments  or  subsidiaries,  and  acquired  brokerage  houses.  Similarly,  some  NBFIs  and \nbrokers have acquired commercial banks; thereby further blurring the boundaries between the \nfinancial subsectors in Pakistan and intensifying interindustry competition. Another trend is the \nformation  of  groups  of  companies  that  include  various  financial  companies.  Some  of  these \ngroups have established informal holding companies.6 \n \nPrivate pension funds have yet to appear as a class of institutional investors in Pakistan, \n11. \nalthough  the  Government  has  taken  the  first  steps  to  allow  private  companies  to  offer  private \npension  products.7  Some  large  private  companies  sponsor  a  variety  of  provident  funds  and \npension schemes. However, their scope is not clear, as centralized reporting is not required  \n \n12. \nThe relative weight of various categories of financial institutions has also changed over \ntime. Total assets of the Pakistan financial sector amounted to $87 billion equivalent or 79% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2005, up from $50 billion or 73% of GDP in 2001. Despite the \nintegration of NBFIs into commercial banks, overall assets of NBFIs kept increasing. However, \nas  a  percentage  of  GDP,  NBFIs\u2019  assets  rose  only  moderately  from  4.9%  in  2001  to  5.9%  in \n2005,  which  was  7.5%  of  overall  financial  sector  assets.  Similarly,  assets  of  insurance \ncompanies, which were equivalent to 2.7% of GDP in 2001, increased to 3.1% of GDP or 3.9% \nof financial sector assets. Over the same period, banking assets increased from 46.7% of GDP \nto 55.6%, accounting for 70.4% of overall financial sector assets. As such, banking has gained \nground  in  absolute  and  relative  terms.  The  bulk  of  the  remaining  financial  sector  assets  were \nunder management of the state-owned Central Directorate of National Savings (18.1% of total); \nits assets as a percentage of GDP decreased from 18.8% in 2001 to 14.3% in 2005.8 \n \nB. \n \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates and supervises \n13. \nthe  sector  to  enforce  the  1984  Company  Ordinance,  the  1969  Securities  Ordinance,  and  a \nnumber of other laws, including the 2000 Insurance Ordinance. SECP was set up in pursuance \nof the 1997 SECP Act and began operations in January 1999. It is a member of the International \nOrganization  of  Securities  Commissions  and,  as  such,  was  a  party  to  the  organization\u2019s \nresolution adopting the Statement of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation.  \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n                                                 \n6  Pakistan has no holding company law. \n7  In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan adopted voluntary pension system rules under which \nasset  management  companies  and  life  insurance  companies  can  act  as  pension  fund  managers.  Life  insurance \ncompanies can also offer annuity plans. \n\n8  Microfinance companies accounted for only 0.1% of overall financial sector assets. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n \n\n35 \n\n \n14.  While SECP\u2019s mandate was initially restricted to securities markets, responsibility for other \nNBFIs  has  been  added.  This  was  in  line  with  a  global  tendency  to  move  to  integrated  financial \nsector  supervision.  With  regard  to  NBFIs  (other  than  insurance),  SECP  introduced  a  regulatory \napproach allowing an NBFI to undertake a wide variety of financial services by increasing equity \ncapital.9 With regard to insurance, regulatory powers are shared with the Ministry of Commerce. \nBanks other than investment banks are regulated and supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan \n(SBP).  SECP  and  SBP  coordinate  their  supervisory  activities,  including  of  financial  institutions \nunder their respective jurisdiction. \n \nC. \n \nSince 2001, equity market capitalization and share prices have increased substantially in \n15. \nPakistan  with  growth  rates  averaging  more  than  50%  each  year.  Equity  market  capitalization \nincreased  from  9%  of  GDP  or  $5  billion  equivalent  in  2001,  to  35%  of  GDP  or  $45.5  billion \nequivalent  in  2006.10  Market  capitalization  is  still  lower  than  in  other  Asian  markets  such  as \nMalaysia  (155%  of  GDP),  India  (92%),  or  Thailand  (68%),  but  this  is mainly  the  result  of slow \ndevelopment during the 1990s. More recently, Pakistan has been gaining ground (Figure A2.2). \n \n\nOverall Capital Market Development Trends \n\nFigure A2.2: Change in Market Capitalization as Percent of GDP \n\n(percent change) \n\n0 \n\n200 \n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000 \n\n1200 \n\n1400 \n\n2000\u20132005\n\n1990\u20132005\n\n    GDP = gross domestic product. \n    Source: International Monetary Fund, and World Exchange Federation.\n\n \n\n \n16. \nHowever, the increase of market capitalization in Pakistan was largely the result of listing \na number of large state-owned enterprises together with the growth in share prices rather than \nsuccessful capital mobilization through equity issues. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The minimum paid-up capital required for an investment bank is PRs300 million. By adding an additional PRs200 \nmillion,  the  NBFI  can  obtain  a  license  for  leasing  operations;  an  additional  PRs200  million  are  required  for  a \ndiscount house, etc.     \n\n10  Figures related to equity market capitalization and listing refer to the Karachi Stock Exchange on which shares are \nmost actively traded. Most companies listed at the exchanges in Islamabad and Lahore are also listed in Karachi. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThailand \n\nMalaysia \n\nIndonesia \n\nPakistan \n\nIndia \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n17.  With regard to market efficiency, liquidity (share turnover) increased by almost 400% in \nabsolute terms since 2000. In relation to GDP it increased from 36% in 2002 to 128% in 2005, \nwhich  is  high  by  regional  standards  (Table  A2.1).  The  same  applies  to  the  ratio  of  share \nturnover  to  market  capitalization.  However,  the  market  remains  narrow  with  95%  of  turnover \nconcentrated  in  the  top  30  shares,  and  just  over  half  in  the  top  10.  Similarly,  the  10  largest \ncompanies alone account for 55% of market capitalization.11 However, only an average of 20% \nof their shares has been floated.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Capital Market Indicators, 2005 \n \n\n26 \n55 \n15 \n38 \n128 \n7 \n51 \n\n \nTurnover \n(% of GDP) \n\n \nTurnover \nRatioa \n1.04 \n0.40 \n0.50 \n0.27 \n3.00 \n0.06 \n0.67 \n\nMarket \nCapitalization \n(% of GDP) \n25 \n137 \n30 \n141 \n42 \n115 \n74 \n\nMarket Capitalization \nof Top 10 Companies \n(%) \n25 \n35 \n53 \n37 \n55 \n61 \n47 \n\n \n \nCountry \nPRC \nIndia \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPakistan \nPhilippines \nThailand \nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na Defined as stock turnover to stock market capitalization. \nSources: International Monetary Fund, Federation of World Exchanges, and Asian Development Bank.  \n \nDespite  progress  made  with  increasing  market  capitalization  and  comparatively  high \n18. \nmarket  turnover,  Pakistan  is  clearly  lagging  other  countries  in  the  region  in  terms  of  resource \nmobilization  through  the  capital  market.  In  2005,  for  instance,  Pakistan  companies  tapped  the \nequity  market  for  some  $68  million  equivalent  in  new  capital  through  initial  ($14 million)  and \nsecondary ($55 million) public offerings. This compares to $19.1 billion in India, $4 billion in the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  $3.7  billion  in  Thailand,  $2  billion  in  Malaysia,  $1  billion  in \nIndonesia, and $900 million in the Philippines. The amounts of equity capital raised in Pakistan \nover  the  preceding  years  were  even  lower  than  in  2005.  The  situation  is  the  same  for  fixed-\nincome  securities:  only  $203  million  equivalent  of  capital  was  raised  through  corporate  bond \nissues in Pakistan in 2005. \n \n19. \nCapital raised through equity and bond issues together was equivalent to 0.3% of GDP \nin  Pakistan.  Banking  products  are  still  much  more  important  for  resource  mobilization  and \ncapital formation than the issuance of securities. While this is the case in many developed and \ndeveloping countries, banking system development in Pakistan is not out of touch with that of \nmost comparable economies, whereas capital market development is (Table 2 in main text). In \ncontrast to other countries in the region, Pakistan\u2019s capital market is not yet an important source \nof corporate finance.  \n \n20. \nNevertheless, the number of equity and bond issues in Pakistan has clearly increased as \ncompared  with  the  1990s.  While  9  corporate  bonds  were  issued  in  1995\u20131999,  68  corporate \nbonds were issued in 2000\u20132005.12 During 2000\u20132005 banks accounted for 35% of total bond \nissues  (by  capital  raised)  and  NBFIs  17%  (Figure  A2.3).  Other  corporate  issuers  represented \n                                                 \n11  Market  capitalization  is  defined  as  the  number  of  shares  of  listed  companies  multiplied  by  their  market  value. \nHowever,  that  does  not  mean  that  all  shares  of  a  company  have  been  listed  (floated).  In  2005,  listed  capital \namounted to just 7.2% of GDP or 17.1% of market capitalization. \n\n12  The  number  and  volume  of  privately  placed  bonds  is  not  known,  because  official  statistics  only  cover  corporate \n\nbonds issued by listed companies under the Securities Law (1969).  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n \n\n37 \n\nthe remaining 48%, including about 20% of capital raised by two large oil and gas companies \nthat are still majority owned by the Government, namely Sui Southern Gas Company and Pak \nArab  Refinery.  Oil  and  gas  companies  were  the  major  equity  issuers  accounting  for  44%  of \ncapital raised in 2000\u20132005 through a total of 39 equity issues. The financial sector represented \na mere 21% of total equity capital raised with 10% accounted for by banks and 11% by NBFIs.  \n \n\nFigure A2.3 Issuers of Securities (2000\u20132005, in percent) \n\n11\n\n17\n\n10\n\n34\n\n44\n\n18\n\n35\n\n30\n\nNonbank Financial\nInstitutions\n\nCommercial Banks\n\nOil Gas and Power\nCompanies\n\nOther\n\nDebt Issues \n\nEquity Issues \n\n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n\n \n21. \nThe more recent issues of securities fit into this picture. In 2005, nonfinancial companies \naccounted  for  about  82%  of  equity  capital  raised  through  a  total  of  six  issues.  Pakistan \nPetroleum  and  Kot  Addu  Power  Company  predominated  as  they  accounted  for  68%  of  total \nissues. Both companies are majority owned by the Government.13 With regard to bond issues, \nbanks accounted for 68% of capital raised through a total of 10 bond issues in 2005, and NBFIs \nfor another 8%.  \n \nPakistan  also  has  a  market  for  government  bonds.  Pakistan  investment  bonds  (PIBs) \n22. \nare by far the most significant type of securities issued by the Government with a share in total \noutstanding  federal  government  bonds  of  91%  (June  2005).  PIBs  in  circulation  amounted  to \n$5.1  billion  equivalent  (about  4%  of  GDP)  in  June  2006,  down  from  $5.6  billion  (about  4%  of \nGDP) in June 2004. As such, the market for PIBs is much larger than that for corporate bonds \n(Figure A2.4). Maturities in circulation are 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years. PIBs are mostly held by \ncommercial  banks;  as  of  June  2005,  52%  of  bonds  in  circulation  were  held  by  banks,  mainly \ndomestic private banks (70%), followed by state-owned banks (21%), and foreign banks (9%). \nWith regard to amount issued, $830 million equivalent (PRs49.23 billion) of bonds was raised in \n2004. This plummeted in 2005 to $2 million equivalent due to expectations of increasing interest \nrates, but increased again in 2006 to $750 million equivalent (PRs44.91 billion), approximately \n0.6% of GDP. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  The Government owns 78.4% of the capital of Pakistan Petroleum, while Water and Power Development Authority \n\nowns 46% of the capital of Kot Addu Power Company. \n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\nFigure A2.4: Bond Issues and Interest Rate Developments  \n\n38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n1.60 \n1.40 \n1.20 \n1.00 \n0.80 \n0.60 \n0.40 \n0.20 \n- \n\n2000\n\n2001 \n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005 \n\n2006\n\nPakistan investment bonds iIssued ($ billion, LHS)\n\nCorporate Bond Issues ($ billion, LHS) \n\n6 months Karachi interbank offered rate (June, RHS)\n\nYield PIB 5 years - weighted average (June, RHS)\n\n    LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side.  \n    Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\nFactors Driving the Market \n\n \n23. \nDerivative  markets  are  almost  nonexistent  in  Pakistan  (with  the  exception  of  currency \nfutures and 1-month single-stock futures) due to underdevelopment of the underlying equity and \nbond  markets.  High  levels  of  derivative  trading  is  usually  associated  with  high  equity  or  bond \ntrading volumes in deep and sufficiently wide cash markets, mainly because the development of \nderivatives  necessitates  sufficient  liquidity  of  cash  markets  (including  pricing  benchmarks)  to \nensure efficient price discovery. \n     \nD. \n \n24. \nPrivatization  through  the  stock  exchange  has  been  a  main  factor  driving  the  market, \ntogether  with  macroeconomic  stabilization,  and\u2014to  a  lesser  degree\u2014international  investor \ndiversification, development of domestic institutional investors, and other structural reforms. \n \n25. \nPrivatization. The Government has divested a large number of SOEs since the 1990s, \nsome of them by listing and partial privatization through the stock exchange(s). This has clearly \nbeen  the  main  driving  force  for  market  capitalization  and  share  prices.  Among  the  10  largest \nlisted  companies  are  6  SOEs,  which  together  account  for  42%  of  total  market  capitalization. \nThese  SOEs  are  Oil  and  Gas  Development  Company  (OGDCL),  Pakistan  Telecommunication \nCompany,  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  Pakistan  Petroleum,  Pakistan  Oilfields,  and  Pakistan \nState  Oil  Company.  Most  of  these  companies  were  partially  privatized  through  the  stock \nexchange  over  the  last  5  years.  OGDCL\u2019s  initial  public  offering  (IPO),  for  instance,  was \nlaunched in 2003, when 5% of its shares were offered for sale through the stock exchange. A \ntotal of $114 million equivalent was raised. A subsequent secondary issue increased the share \nof  floated  OGDCL  shares  to  15%  of  total  shares.  As  of  January  2007,  OGDCL  accounted  for \n18% of overall stock market capitalization. National Bank of Pakistan\u2019s IPO took place in 2002, \nwhen  10%  of  its  shares  were  offered  for  sale.  In  2002  and  2003,  an  additional  13.2%  of  its \nshares  were  sold  through  the  stock  exchange.  A  total  of  $29  million  equivalent  was  raised \nthrough  these  three  issues.  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  accounted  for  6.5%  of  total  market \ncapitalization in January 2007. Pakistan Petroleum\u2019s IPO, which raised $18.1 million equivalent, \noccurred  in  2004.  This  company  accounted  for  another  6%  of  total  market  capitalization  in \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n39 \n\nJanuary  2007.  Other  large  SOEs  listed  recently  include  United  Bank  (IPO  in  2005,  15%  of \nshares  offered;  $18.1  million  equivalent  raised)  and  Kot  Addu  Power  Company  (IPO  in  2005; \n20% of shares offered; $80.2 million equivalent raised). Shares of SOEs offered for sale through \nthe  stock  market  are  typically  heavily  oversubscribed,  given  the  expectation  of  subsequent \nsubstantial share price increases. \n \n26. \nStructural  Reforms.  Undeniable  progress  has  been  made  in  Pakistan  with  other \nstructural reforms. These reforms have led to substantial changes such as a much higher share \nof private enterprises in- and outside the financial sector; consolidation of the NBFI subsector, \nwhich  now  consists  of  a  smaller  number  of  better  capitalized  and  more  efficiently  managed \nentities;  and  a  better  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  for  capital  markets.  Work  is  under \nway to enhance corporate governance and disclosure, which is important because both figure \nprominently in investment decisions. On the technical side, significant progress has been made \nin  establishing  electronic  clearing  and  settlement  systems.  However,  that  has  yet  to  turn  the \ncapital  market  into  a  significant  source  of  capital  formation.  Moderate  progress  has, \nnevertheless, been made as evidenced by the increased number of securities issues. The policy \nof  SBP  to  increase  capital  requirements  for  banks  step-by-step  has,  for  instance,  motivated  a \nnumber of commercial banks to raised capital through bond issues (paras. 20\u201321).   \n \n27.  Macroeconomic Environment. High economic growth, consumer demand, and higher \ncorporate earnings have certainly facilitated market development in Pakistan as compared with \nthe  1990s.  The  same  applies  to  the  monetary  environment.  The  exchange  rate  and  inflation \noutlook has stabilized since 1999, lengthening time horizons and reducing the cost of borrowing. \nInterest rates declined significantly during 2001\u20132003. Since 2004, inflation has picked up again \nand  its  outlook  is  less  stable  (Figure  A2.5).  This  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  market  for \ngovernment bonds, particularly in 2005 when only a small portion of the PIBs offered could be \nplaced (Figure A2.4). \n \nThe impact of higher and more volatile inflation and rising interest rates on the corporate \n28. \nbond  market  was  mitigated  by  increasingly  using  floating  rates  for  newly  issued  corporate \nbonds. Only two corporate bonds placed since 2004 had a fixed rate. Most other issues had a \nfloating rate anchored to the Karachi interbank offered rate (KIBOR) with a spread of 1.5 to 3.0 \npercentage  points  over  KIBOR.14  In  real  terms,  annual  yields  of  such  bonds  were  negative  in \n2004 and early 2005, and subsequently increased over time to about 5%.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  The anchor  was mostly the 6-month Karachi interbank offered rate, since interest on these bonds is due every 6 \n\nmonths. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n10 \n\n8 \n\n6 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\nFigure A2.5: Interest Rate and Price Developments \n\nConsumer price inflation, year-on-year \n\nKIBOR \n\nKIBOR (6 month), percent per annum \nKIBOR (6 month), percent per annum \n(6  month),  percent  per  annum \n\n0 \nJUL 03  NOV03  MAR04 \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\nJUL 04  NOV04 MAR05\n\nJUL 05 NOV05 MAR06  JUL 06  NOV06\n\n \n\nPhilippines\n\n(as percent of GDP)\n\nFigure A2.6: Mutual Funds Assets under Management in 2006  \n\n \nDomestic Institutional Investors. Domestic institutional investors such as mutual funds \n29. \nor insurance companies have emerged as a relatively new force in Pakistan\u2019s financial sector. \nThe mutual funds subsector remains small relative to other countries in the region (Figure A2.6), \nand retail investors account for the bulk of exchange trading.15 However, assets of mutual funds \nand insurance companies have grown recently (para. 12). In 2006, total assets of mutual funds \namounted  to  $2.9  billion  equivalent  and  insurance  companies  $3.4  billion.  As  such,  they  are \nrelevant forces in the market.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na  2005 figure. \nSources: International Monetary Fund and Securities and Exchange Commission of\n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\nPakistan \n\nThailand \n\nPRC \n\n1.4a \n\nIndia\n\n4.3 \n\n2.2 \n\n1.6 \n\n22.9\n\n8.3\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n25\n\n14\n\n5 \n\n0 \n\n                                                 \n15  About  40,000  individual  investors  have  an  account  at  Central  Depository  Company.  Another  200,000  have \naccounts at Central Depository Company through brokers. An unknown number of individuals invest in securities \nthrough accounts of other individuals or brokers, although this is not permitted by law.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n \n\n41 \n\nSince the removal of controls on mutual fund activities, most funds focus on investment \n30. \nin  equity.  Equity  funds  accounted  for  85%  of  total  assets  under  management  in  2005,  debt \nfunds  for  only  1%.16  In  contrast,  insurance  companies  are  still  confronted  with  particular \nrestrictions on investments that can be made, although steps have been made to ease controls \non  asset  allocation.  While  77%  of  the  assets  of  life  insurance  companies  were  invested  in \nsecurities  in  2001\u20132005,  these  were  mainly  government  securities.  However,  investment  in \nequity  increased  from  10%  in  2001  to  16%  in  2005.  As  such,  insurance  companies  are \nincreasingly important as investors in corporate securities. \n \n31. \nThe  increase  in  assets  of  mutual  funds  reflects  higher  prices  of  assets  rather  than \nadditional capital mobilized. Despite low deposit rates offered by banks, mutual funds still attract \na  comparatively  small  proportion  of  national  savings.  The  same  applies  to  other  institutional \ninvestors.  While  overall  national  savings  amounted  to  16.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2005,  savings \nmobilized by the financial sector amounted to only 7.5% of GDP. The bulk of financial savings is \naccounted  for  by  banks  (6.5%  of  GDP).  Capital  mobilized  by  mutual  funds  and  other  NBFIs \namounted to only 0.3 % of GDP (Table 1 in main text).   \n \n32. \nIn  addition, the  recent SBP  decision  to  allow mutual  funds  to  invest up  to  30% of  their \nassets  internationally  (with  a  cap  of  $15  million)  may  reduce  their  demand  for  domestic \nsecurities  in  the  short  term,  although  the  decision  is  certainly  beneficial  for  long-term \ndevelopment of the industry.  \n \n33. \nCentral  Directorate  of  National  Savings  investments  are  concentrated  in  government \nsecurities.  Despite  the  net  outflow  of  its  assets  over  recent  years,  this  state-owned  institution \nstill  had  an  estimated  $15.6  billon  under  management  in  2005.  Further,  the  state-owned \nEmployees\u2019 Old Age Benefits Institution,17 which provides mandatory defined benefit coverage \nfor  workers  of  private  enterprises  with  10  or  more  employees,  had  another  $1.6  billion  under \nmanagement. Of these assets, 84% were invested in government securities, mainly low-yielding \ndefense  saving  certificates.  Investment  in  shares,  however,  increased  from  2%  of  total \ninvestment (June 2003) to 7% (June 2005).  \n   \n34. \nInternational Investor Diversification. Inflow of portfolio investment into Pakistan has \nincreased  recently,  underlining  the  fact  that  the  investor  base  of  Pakistan  companies  is  not \nrestricted  to  domestic  investors.  Foreign  portfolio  investment  rose  to  $334  million  during \nFY2006,  up  from  an  aggregated  inflow  of  $202  million  over  the  preceding  3  years.18 \nInternational investors now play a key role in Pakistan\u2019s capital market. While their accumulated \ninvestments are still relatively small, foreign investors own a significant share of the free float of \nequities,  i.e.,  equity  actually  available  for  trading.  The  growing  size  of  the  capital  market  will \nmake  Pakistan  eligible  for  inclusion  in  an  increasing  number  of  international  indices,  which \nshould attract some renewed inflows from abroad and accelerate Pakistan\u2019s integration in global \ncapital markets. \n \n35. \nThe  increasing  inflow  of  foreign  portfolio  investment  in  Pakistan  is  in  line  with \ninternational  and  regional  trends.  One  underlying  factor  is  the  dramatic  increase  of  flows  from \ndedicated  emerging  market  funds;  another  is  the  loosening  of  controls  on  foreign  investor \nparticipation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16  The balance is accounted for by money market and mixed funds. \n17  The  pension  system  in  Pakistan  also  comprises  civil  servants  pensions,  which  are  unfunded,  and  a  variety  of \n\nprovident funds and pensions schemes sponsored and operated by large private employers.  \n\n18  This does not include investment into Eurobonds internationally issued by the Government of Pakistan.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\nSince 2002, foreign investors are no longer required to obtain prior SBP authorization to \n36. \ninvest in Pakistan securities on a repatriation basis. In particular, nonresidents, including foreign \nfirms,  are  free  to  (i)  purchase  and  transfer  shares  issued  by  a  public  or  private  company  in \nmanufacturing or in other sectors open to foreign investors as per the Government Investment \nPolicy  (e.g.,  infrastructure  and  agriculture);  (ii)  transfer  shares  quoted  on  the  stock exchanges \nirrespective  of  the  business  of  the  company;  (iii)  transfer  Pakistan  securities  on  a  repatriable \nbasis  to  other  eligible  nonresidents  on  the  same  basis  against  payment  outside  Pakistan;  (iv) \npurchase  Government  securities;  and  (v)  purchase  and  transfer  corporate  debt  instruments \ndenominated  in  local  currency.  Nonresidents  are  allowed  to  trade  shares  quoted  on  the  stock \nexchanges  in  Pakistan,  provided  they  open  a  special  convertible  rupee  account  with  any \nauthorized  dealer  in  Pakistan.  The  funds  deposited  in  this  account  can  be  transferred  outside \nPakistan  or  credited  to  a  foreign  currency  account  maintained  in  Pakistan  at  any  time  without \nany approval of SBP. These accounts can also be credited with dividend income. Listed stock in \nPakistan  (except  in  life  insurance  companies)  have  no  foreign  investment  ceiling.  As  such, \ncontrols  on foreign  investment  in  shares  and  bonds  have  been  substantially  loosened.19  Entry \nand exit of foreign investment is free. The resulting inflows of foreign portfolio investment have \nbeen taken on a rapidly increasing role in driving the market, and reflect Pakistan\u2019s significant \nprogress in integrating into global capital markets.  \n \n37. \nApart  from  foreign  portfolio  investments  into  securities  traded  in  Pakistan,  Pakistan \ncompanies can also raise capital abroad. This can, for instance, be in the form of cross-listing at \na foreign exchange. Cross-listing allows individual companies to achieve integration with global \ncapital  markets  and  benefit  from  better  market  infrastructure  and  an  expanded  investor  base. \nTwo Pakistan companies, MCB Bank and OGDCL, have taken this step so far. MCB Bank was \nlisted at the London Stock Exchange in October 2006 where it issued global depository receipts \nto increase its capital. A total of $155 million equivalent (\u00a379 million) was raised. OGDCL was \nlisted  at  the  London  Stock  Exchange  in  December  2006  when  the  Government  of  Pakistan \ndivested an additional 10% of its shareholding in the company by issuing an equivalent amount \nof  global  depository  receipts.20  The  total  capital  raised  was  $934  million  equivalent  (\u00a3477 \nmillion),  mainly  from  international  institutional  investors.  Only  5%  was  reportedly  absorbed  by \nPakistan investors. \n \n38. \n \n \n\nTable A2.2 provides key financial sector indicators for Pakistan. \n\n                                                 \n19  In  2005,  SBP  adopted  additional  measures  to  liberalize  the  foreign  exchange  regime,  which  include  (i)  the \npossibility for authorized dealers to provide foreign exchange up to a maximum of $100,000 or equivalent in other \ncurrencies  to  branches  of  foreign  companies  operating  in  Pakistan  for  payments  for  utilization  of  information \ntechnology  services;  and  (ii)  permission  to  Pakistan  companies  to  purchase  and  sell  foreign  currency  notes  and \ncoins. \n\n20  See  para.  25.

The overall goal of the FMGP \nwas  to  facilitate  private-sector-led  productivity  growth  and  social  protection.  This  was  to  be \nachieved  by  improving  the  framework  for  mobilization  of  long-term  resources  for  saving  and \ninvestment through market-based financial instruments and institutions.  \n \n2. \nThe  FMGP  was  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  agenda,  and \ndevelopment  of  capital  markets  and  other  nonbank  financial  services.  The  FMGP  aimed  to \nachieve \nimproved  governance, \ntransparency,  and  investor  protection;  (ii)  increasing  the  depth  and  diversity  of  financial \nintermediation  through  new  capital  market  issues  to  mobilize  savings  and  investments; \n(iii) improving  operating  efficiency  and  risk  management  of  intermediaries;  and  (iv)  reducing \nfinancial sector vulnerabilities. \n \n3. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  reform  measures  were  implemented,  including  for  policy, \ngovernance, institutions, and market operations. The reform agenda was structured around five \ncomponents:  (i)  improvement  of  the  fiscal,  interest  rate,  and  investment  policy  environment; \n(ii) improvement  of  governance  of  market  participants  and  transparency  in  information \ndisclosure;  (iii)  increase  in  supply  of  financial  instruments  and  improvements  in  market \ninfrastructure;  (iv)  increase  in  demand  for  financial  instruments  through  development  of \ncontractual  savings  and  institutional  investment;  and  (v)  development  of  related  financial \nservices and institutions. \n \nB. \n \nThe FMGP was a comprehensive reform effort, in that it focused on almost all aspects of \n4. \nnonbank  financial  sector  development  in  Pakistan.  Among  others,  it  aimed  to  strengthen  the \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  securities  markets,  facilitate  privatization  through  the  stock \nexchanges,  enact  legislation  on  financial  transactions  and  corporate  affairs,  and  revamp  large \nGovernment controlled institutions in life insurance. The FMGP established a good environment \nfor change.  \n \n5. \nHowever, accomplishment of many of the specific measures will need significantly more \ntime.  The  efforts  required,  the  complexity  of  reforms,  and  the  political  sensitivity  were \ndisproportionate  to  the  time  provided  to  achieve  such  reforms  in  any  developing  country.  For \ninstance, the FMGP had 42 policy conditions (with 97 subconditions) at the outset. A program \nloan of $260 million was approved in December 2002 to provide financing for structural reforms, \ndesigned  to  be  disbursed  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $100  million  was  released  in \nMay 2003 against the fulfillment of 24 conditions (comprising 40 subconditions).  \n \n\nOverall Program Performance  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  and \nGuarantees  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Financial  (Nonbank)  Markets  and  Governance  Program. \nManila  (TA  Loan  1956-PAK:  Strengthening  Pension,  Insurance  and  Savings  Systems,  and  TA  Loan  1957-PAK: \nStrengthening Regulation, Enforcement, and Governance of Nonbank Financial Markets). \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nProposed Approach for Carrying the Reforms Forward \n\nThe  remaining  18  conditions  were  divided  into  57  subconditions.  Symptomatic  of  the \n6. \ncomplexity is the delay in reaching full compliance. In September 2005, an incentive subtranche of \n$80 million was released against the fulfillment of 9 conditions (comprising 26 subconditions). This \ninvolved  a  delay  of  about  2  years,  as  the  incentive  tranche  was  planned  to  be  disbursed  in \nNovember 2003. The remaining tranche of $80 million has been pending since November 2004, \nwith 9 policy conditions (comprising 31 subconditions) to be complied with. However, to date, after \nabout  30  months,  a  number  of  these  conditions  remain  only  partly  complied  with.  Such  delays, \nwhile justifiable with hindsight, have reduced the reform momentum. More importantly, the rigidity \nof  certain  policy  conditions,  in  areas  such  as  enactment  of  legislation  or  privatization,  has \nintroduced a sense of trauma in the minds of Government officials championing the reforms.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nIn view of the difficulties entailed in implementing the FMGP, the Government has asked \nADB to cancel the pending FMPG tranche of $80 million. However, it remains committed to the \nreforms envisaged under the FMGP, but a longer time frame and a more targeted approach will \nbe needed. The Government has asked ADB to design a focused capital market reform agenda \nthrough  the  proposed  Second  Generation  Capital  Market  Reform  Program.  Specifically,  the \nGovernment has been particular that any legislative actions should be targeted. Reforms in the \ninsurance subsector and public pension system, while important for capital market reforms, will \nrequire  greater  consensus  building  within  the  Government.  They  should  be  pursued  under  a \ndedicated contractual savings reform initiative.  \n \n8. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  request,  the  Second  Generation  Capital  Market  Reform  Program \ntargets  primarily  those  actions  that  are  within  the  control  of  the  Government,  and  specifically \nwithin  the  domain  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  (SECP).  The \ninvolvement  and  commitment  of  a  single  nodal  agency  such  as  SECP  is  vital  for  successful \nimplementation  of  the  reforms.  For  instance,  8  of  the  9  conditions  that  were  fulfilled  for  the \nincentive tranche were within SECP\u2019s mandate. \n \n9. \nFigure A3 presents a schematic view of how the reform agenda supported by ADB in the \nnonbank  financial  subsectors  has  emerged  over  the  last  10  years,  starting  with  the  Capital \nMarket Development Program approved in 1997, to the FMGP approved in 2002, moving to the \nproposed Program. Table A3.1 aims to show the linkages between the policy reforms adopted \nin the FMGP, and how they will be pursued under the proposed Program, with specific focus on \nthe 9 policy conditions that have not been fully complied with.2 In contrast, Table A3.2 outlines \nthe  status  of  compliance  with  the  9  policy  conditions  that  were  complied  with  by  2005,  and \njustified the release of the incentive tranche under the FMGP. \n \n10. \nBased on extensive consultations with the Government and assessments made by staff, \nthe  proposed  approach  is  prudent  for  supporting  forward-looking  reforms.  It  is  targeted  and \nrecognizes  the  time  required  to  change  mindsets  to  achieve  consensus  and  fully  implement \nreforms.  The  legislative  agenda  is  modest,  confined  to  securities  markets.  However,  the \nproposed  legislation  would  enable  Pakistan  to  form  an  integrated  nonbank  financial  sector \nsupervisor  by  upgrading  SECP  to  the  Financial  Services  Commission  of  Pakistan.  The \nprivatization  agenda  is  targeted,  with  support  for  the  gradual  steps  to  be  taken  for  the \ndivestment  of  the  National  Investment  Trust.  ADB  will  undertake  other  more  complex \ninstitutional reform in the insurance and public pension subsectors separately under dedicated \nprograms after building adequate consensus. \n                                                 \n2  The  Board  paper  on  the  incentive  subtranche  presents  the  full  details  on  the  compliance  with  the  other  9  policy \nconditions  (comprising  26  subconditions).

Rationalize tax treatment for financial instruments (Target date: June 2003) \n\nCompliance Status as of January 2007 \n\nRationalize stamp duties by lowering stamp \nduties for corporate paper to internationally \ncompetitive rates. \n\nContinuation \n\nStamp duties impede bond market development by \nsignificantly increasing the cost of issuing bonds and \nmaking them less attractive than other sources of \nfinancing. Under the proposed Program, the \ngovernment will reduce the stamp duties on corporate \nbonds at least in Islamabad Capital Territory. By \nencouraging competition to issue bonds within the \ncapital territory jurisdiction, this move is expected to \nencourage others to follow suit. \n\nNot complied with. In 2005, the Bond Market Working \nGroup, which comprised representatives of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), State \nBank of Pakistan (SBP), issuers of corporate bonds and \ncommercial papers, and investment banks, studied bond \nmarket development constraints. The working group \nrecommended reducing the stamp duty from 0.15% of the \nissued volume of corporate bonds to 0.05%. The \nGovernment of Punjab reduced the stamp duty for \ncorporate bonds to 0.05%, but decided to levy the duty \nper annum rather than only once. This means that the \nstamp duty is actually higher for new bonds with maturity \nabove 2 years. The Sindh government has not reduced \nthe stamp duty on issues but marginally reduced the \nstamp duty on subsequent transfers. Islamabad Capital \nTerritory has not yet taken any action. \n\n2. Adjust fiscal measures to promote long-term capital formation (Target date: June 2004) \n\nExtend capital gains tax exemption beyond \nFY2004 only for investments held more \nthan 6 months, through the Finance Act \n2004 or other appropriate legislation. \n\nNot complied with. Capital gains are tax exempt, \nincluding those from investments held for less than 6 \nmonths. \n\nUnder the proposed Program, the Government will \nextend the capital gains tax exemption throughout the \nprogram period to encourage long-term capital \nformation. To address high-market volatility due to \nexcessive short-term speculative trading, the \nGovernment has introduced a withholding tax on \nsecurities market turnover, which is easier to levy \nand, therefore, more feasible under Pakistan \nconditions than capital gains taxation (through the \nincome tax) on income from short-term investment in \nshares. \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n \n\n4\n7\n\n \n\n\fFMGP Policy Condition \n3.

In May 2006, the Government agreed \nto adopt a strategy, corporate plan, gap analysis, and \nreform implementation plan by December 2006 based on \nthe recommendations of the TA consultants. By December \n2006, the strategic plan was drafted and discussed with \nCDNS and Ministry of Finance (MOF), and a three-phased \napproach was proposed, since the current CDNS \norganization and information systems are not capable of \nsupporting a funded system. Phase one, which may take \nat least 3 years foresees the completion of an automation \nproject, creation of the capability for full accrual accounting \nof liabilities, creation of a corporation and recruitment of \nindividuals for key positions, and creation of the capability \nfor a more accurate estimation of receipts and \nrepayments. Phase two foresees implementing a pricing \nmechanism that is fully subject to market rates, and \ndetermining the effective cost and impact of the pricing \nreform on fund mobilization. Phase three foresees a \nreview of the proposal to fund the NSS. Until now, the \nGovernment has not made a decision on the proposed \nstrategic plan and no steps have been taken to implement \nthe plan or parts of it.  \n \nNot complied with. Consultants have been recruited to \ndevelop a software solution. The software is expected to \nbe pilot tested at 27 sites by mid-2007. CDNS expects to \nhave a systemwide rollout in 2008. \n\n \n\n(ii)   Computerize collections following a \n\ntime frame developed under TA1. \n\nComponent II.

The Cabinet approved a draft Anti-\nMoney Laundering Act in June 2005, and submitted it to \nParliament in September 2005. It is now pending in \nParliament. The draft Corporate Rehabilitation Act still \nawaits submission to the Cabinet. MOF is in the process of \nrecruiting a consultant to finalize the draft.  \n \n\nWhile comprehensive, this is an area where the FMGP \nwas ambitious, in that finalization and enactment of \nlegislation have become more sensitive than \nanticipated at the time of design. ADB has started \nprocessing TA to support the Government and State \nBank of Pakistan in building capacity for anti-money \nlaundering. Policy dialogue continues in the area of \ncorporate affairs, including corporate rehabilitation; and \nsupported, if suitable, through a focused policy-based \nintervention. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFMGP Policy Condition \n\nCompliance Status as of January 2007 \n\nContinuation \n\n(ii) Amend, if needed, the Companies \nOrdinance 1984 to improve \ncorporate governance standards, \nTrust Act 1888, for modern \ninvestment needs, SECP Act 1997, \nSecurities and Exchange Ordinance \n1969, Central Depository Act 1997, \nand other laws as identified under \nTA2. \n\n(iii) Transfer selected powers of high \n\ncourts in relation to \nimplementation of the Companies \nOrdinance 1984, as appropriate. \n\nNot complied with. The Companies Ordinance has been \namended to strengthen disclosure of related party \ntransactions for listed companies. Additional amendments \nto the Companies Ordinance were drafted. However, the \nGovernment subsequently established a working group in \n2006 to draft a new company law. The Central Depository \nAct was amended. SECP has started drafting a new \nsecurities law and a new financial services commission \nlaw. However, these draft laws have yet to be finalized and \nsubmitted to MOF. Meantime, amendments have been \nmade to the Securities and Exchange Ordinance 1969 \nthrough the Finance Act 2006 to provide a legal basis for \ndemutualizing stock exchanges. SECP is drafting \namendments to the Insurance Ordinance 2000, and plans \nto submit them to the Ministry of Commerce for \nendorsement by June 2007. Amendments to the Trust Act \nhave been drafted, but have yet to be cleared by SECP \nand submitted to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Law \nand Justice, the Cabinet, and, subsequently, Parliament. \nNot complied with. SECP initially planned to draft \namendments to the Companies Ordinance, to be \nsubsequently submitted to the Government and \nParliament. However, SECP has decided not to draft such \namendments before the enactment of a new company \nordinance.  \n\nThe proposed Program takes a targeted approach. \nThe Government will advance new legislation on \nsecurities markets to replace the 1969 Securities and \nExchange Ordinance. Further, the Government will \nsubmit to Parliament a law codifying the Financial \nServices Commission of Pakistan. This law would \nreplace the 1997 SECP Act. These two laws, which \nhave been drafted in line with international best \npractices with TA support, will be submitted to the \nGovernment as a first tranche condition and to \nParliament as a second tranche condition, and will \nprovide a sound legal basis for the development of \nnonbank financial markets and institutions in Pakistan. \nThey are, therefore, crucial for capital market \ndevelopment. \n\nAs more in-depth consultations are needed, the \nGovernment has established a working group with \nbroad participation to draft a new company ordinance \nand propose related reforms. TA support could be \nconsidered, if requested.   \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n \n\n4\n9\n\n \n\n\f \n\nFMGP Policy Condition \n8.

Karachi Stock Exchange \nsubmitted a plan for demutualization in April 2005. The \nenabling legal framework for demutualization has been \nprovided through amendments to the Securities and \nExchange Ordinance 1969.

However, under the Program the \nGovernment will ensure that the Securities Law grants \nSECP (FSCP) authority to require a unified national \nmarket system in securities that may include one or \nmore securities exchanges and alternative trading \nplatforms. Such a national market system can be \ncreated through systematic exchange of information \nbetween various trading platforms in combination with \nlegal and regulatory requirements for brokers. To \ninstitutionalize exchange of information and \ncooperation between the exchanges, SECP under the \nProgram will require stock exchanges to establish an \nintermarket surveillance committee. The committee \nwould meet regularly to coordinate stock market \nsurveillance and oversight of securities that are traded \non more than one stock exchange.   \n\nMore time is required for the Government and other \nstakeholders to build the broad consensus needed for \nstructural reforms in the area of the old-age benefit \nsystem and state-owned insurance industry.

However, they \nwere not in line with international best practice. SECP has, \ntherefore, drafted amendments to the NBFC rules to \nstrengthen them, and submitted the amendments to the \nGovernment in January 2007 for clearance. However, the \nMinistry of Law has not cleared the amendments on the \ngrounds that SECP does not have a sufficient legal \nmandate to enforce prudential requirements.   \n\nUnder the Program, the Government will strengthen \nprudential requirements for nonbank financial \ncompanies. That requires amendments to the \nCompany Ordinance to strengthen SECP\u2019s legal \nmandate. These amendments can be effected \nthrough the Finance Bill 2007\u20132008. In addition, the \nProgram requires the Government to clarify SECP\u2019s \nlegal mandate in respect to its powers, functions, and \nresponsibilities over nonbank financial companies by \ndrafting (with ADB TA) and submitting to Parliament \nfor approval legislation on such companies. \n\n17.

A strong economic growth (7.5% average) for 3  years in  a row,  a large inflow  of \nremittances  (over  $4  billion  per  annum)  in  recent  years,  and  many  other  interventions  contributed  to  the  decline  in \npoverty.  Notwithstanding  this  development,  around  36.45  million  people  in  Pakistan  still  live  below  the  poverty  line. \nFurther reduction in poverty is a major challenge for the Government. \n \nDespite  the  progress  made  in  implementing  capital  market  reforms,  the  contribution  of  the  sector  to  private  sector \ndevelopment has been as weak as its role in capital mobilization for productive investment. The Program will enhance \nthe capital markets\u2019 capacity to carry out its intermediation role effectively by deepening reforms, and strengthening the \nenabling policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional environment for nonbank financial institutions and markets. This will \nimprove  companies\u2019  access  to  finance;  facilitate  people\u2019s  access  to  financial  services,  particularly  pension  products; \nand help to protect vulnerable parts of the population against fraud:  \n \n(i) \nThe  Program  aims  at  removing  the  major  constraints  to  the  development  of  the  corporate  bond  market  by \nreducing  the  costs  of  issuing  bonds,  simplifying  the  underlying  procedures,  and  supporting  the  development  of  a \nbenchmark yield curve for pricing corporate bonds. Corporate bond market development will facilitate the financing of \ninfrastructure  projects,  which  requires  long-term  finance  in  the  form  of  bonds  (fixed-income  securities).  This  will \nsupport poverty reduction goals by helping to provide the population with infrastructure services and freeing up public \nresources needed to provide social services. Further, the Program will support balanced development of the financial \nsector, which will make the financial sector less vulnerable to crisis, by which low-income groups of the population tend \nto be more seriously affected than high-income groups. \n \n(ii) \nThe limited availability of contractual savings (e.g., complementary pension schemes) has made the weakest \npart  of  the  population  more  vulnerable  to  uncertain  events.  The  Program  will  support  development  of  institutional \ninvestors  by  improving  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  of  voluntary  private  pension  and  occupational  saving \nschemes.  This  will  allow  low-income  groups  of  the  population  to  enter  into  well-regulated  and  protected  contractual \nsavings schemes, access the capital market through these schemes, and benefit from higher returns of capital market \ninstruments. The outreach of new pension products, for which the Program will provide an enabling framework, will be \ncountrywide, i.e., include rural areas where the poor are concentrated. \n \n(iii) \nThe  Program  will  help  to  strengthen  the  governance  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  and  markets.  This  will \nincrease  market  transparency  and  the  protection  of  investors  against  fraud,  which  is  particularly  important  for \nunsophisticated investors, including vulnerable parts of the population. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n83 \n\nC.
