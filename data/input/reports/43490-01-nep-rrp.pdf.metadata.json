The  project  aims  to \naddress  key  impediments  to  infrastructure  development  in  Nepal  through  the  creation  of  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  generation  of  long-term  financing  and  active  private  sector \nparticipation (PSP) in infrastructure. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nNepal is in the process of reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction after its decade-\nlong  conflict.  Key  stakeholders  reached  a  comprehensive  peace  agreement  in  2006,  and \nsuccessfully  held  constituent  assembly  elections  in  2008.  The  macroeconomic  environment  has \nimproved  and  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  3.5%  in  FY2010.  The  restoration  of  peace \naugurs well for the revival of the country\u2019s development and poverty reduction agenda. However, \nthe post-conflict political transition has been complex and challenging, with a protracted peace and \nconstitution drafting process.  \n\nto \n\nin  Nepal.  The \n\ninfrastructure  sector \n\ninclusive  economic  growth \n\nNepal faces continuing, daunting development challenges across all sectors. Poverty is still \n3. \nwidespread  in  the  country  and  economic  growth  remains  uneven.  Poor  infrastructure  is  a  critical \nconstraint \nis  grossly \nunderdeveloped, with large sections of the population lacking access to basic services. More than \n18  million  people  are  still  without  access  to  electricity,  mainly  in  the  rural  areas  and  remote \ndistricts. 1  The  persistent  energy  shortages  disrupt  economic  activity  and  impose  hardship, \nespecially  on  the  poor.  Poor  physical  connectivity,  resulting  from  underinvestment  in  roads, \nsignificantly increases costs of production and trade as well as access to basic social services.  \n \n4. \nNepal needs to invest an estimated $40 billion in infrastructure for 2009\u20132025 to achieve its \ntarget  GDP  growth  rate  of  7%. 2  Investment  requirements  have  risen  rapidly  due  to  delayed \ninvestment and damage to infrastructure during the conflict.3  Nepal spends less than 1% of total \nGDP  on  infrastructure,  which  is  significantly  less  than  other  countries  in  the  region. 4  Public \nfinancing is already constrained by the high cost of post-conflict reconstruction efforts and limited \nfiscal  space,  and  cannot  generate  the  needed  level  of  infrastructure  investment.  Private  sector \ninvestment is needed to bridge the infrastructure financing gap critical to Nepal's development and \npoverty-reduction  efforts,  but  PSP  in  infrastructure  in  Nepal  has  been  low  due  to  the  lack  of  an \nenabling environment to attract larger investments in this sector. \n\n5. \nInitial  efforts  by  the  Government  of  Nepal  to  introduce  policies  and  incentives  for \ninfrastructure  financing  have  been  ad  hoc  and  fragmented.  Infrastructure  financing  in  Nepal \nremains impeded by multiple and interlocking constraints resulting from the (i) absence of a well-\n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank,  Department  for  International  Development,  and  International  Labour  Organization.  2009. \n\nCountry Diagnostic Studies. Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n\n2  The 7% desired rate of growth was specified in the Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries (an \noutcome  of  the  Brussels  Declaration  in  May  2001),  and  will  help  Nepal  meet  its  Millennium  Development  Goals. \nFeedback Ventures. 2008. Feasibility Study and Business Plan for Setting Up an Infrastructure Financing Institution in \nNepal. Kathmandu (August). \n\n3  It is estimated that $129.6 million worth of physical infrastructure was damaged during the conflict in Nepal. (Footnote \n\n1). \n\n4  India spent roughly 4.8% of total GDP on infrastructure in 2007 and 2008. It is estimated that South Asian countries \nneed  an  annual  investment  in  key  infrastructure  subsectors  of  about  6%\u20137%  of  their  GDP  to  achieve  their  growth \ntargets. (http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=22513) \n\n\f 2 \n\n \n\ndeveloped  capital  market  for  raising  long-term  funds,  such  as  bond  and  equity  financing;  (ii)  \ninadequate policy and regulatory framework, which is not conducive to PSP in infrastructure; and \n(iii) lack of viable projects and capacity for project structuring to attract private sector investments. \nThe challenging political transition5 has an adverse impact on investor sentiment that exacerbates \nthese constraints. \n\n6. \nThe  current  political  uncertainty  and  subdued  investment  climate  augurs  in  favor  of  an \nincremental  approach  to  capital  market  development  in  Nepal,  and  in  the  absence  of  any  major \npolicy  reforms,  any  intervention  supporting  capital  market  development  must  build  on  tangible, \npiecemeal achievements. \n \n7. \nUnderdeveloped bond market. Long-term committed funding for infrastructure projects is \nbest  supported  by  a  mature  and  vibrant  bond  market,  but  Nepal's  bond  market  remains \nconstrained,  accounting  for  just  12.6%  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  2009.  The  government  issues  most \n(90%) of Nepal\u2019s debt securities, in the form of treasury bills and bonds which are largely held to \nmaturity. There is no coherent public debt management strategy to guide decisions on the volume \nand  maturity  of  each  issuance,  which  are  done  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  primarily  to  meet  short-term \nfinancing  needs.    From  a  macroeconomic  perspective,  additional  effort  is  required  to  strengthen \neconomic fundamentals to develop a low inflation and stable interest rate environment. \n\n8. \nThe  Nepalese  institutional  investor  base  is  too  narrow  to  support  an  active  bond  market. \nCommercial  banks  are  the  largest  investors  in  government  securities,  and  invest  mainly  to  meet \nstatutory liquidity requirements. Having primary dealers serve as agents for the sale of government \nsecurities  can  contribute  significantly  to  trading  of  these  securities  in  the  secondary  market,  but \nsuch a provision and practice does not exist in  Nepal. Secondary trading is negligible due to the \nlack of investor base and inadequate clearing and settlement systems. Processing of information \ntakes  10\u201315  days  and  securities  are  issued  in  paper  form,  which  is  subject  to  human  error  and \nfraud.   \n\n9. \nThe  lack  of  a  reliable  issuance  calendar,  minimal  government  securities,  trading  volume, \nand  negligible  liquidity  in  the  secondary  market  all  contribute  to  the  lack  of  a  liquid  sovereign \nbenchmark  yield  curve  that  is  essential  for  pricing  corporate  bonds  and  long-term  debt  financing \ninstruments.  Moreover,  the  absence  of  a  credit  rating  agency  in  the  country  limits  the  ability  of \ninvestors to make informed investment decisions. Consequently, corporate bond market activity is \nalmost non-existent. \n\nAttention  needs  to  be  given  to  improve  the  laws,  regulations,  and  supervision  for  bond \n10. \nmarket development. Nepal\u2019s financial regulators, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the Securities \nBoard  of  Nepal  (SEBON),  have  overlapping  roles  in  securities  market  regulation.  While  the \nSecurities  Related  Act,  2007,  provides  the  legal  basis  for  SEBON,  it  provides  inadequate \nindependence  and  enforcement  powers;  when  coupled  with  SEBON\u2019s  capacity  constraints,  this \nrenders it unable to effectively fulfill its market development and regulation mandates. \n\n11.  Weak  policy  and  institutional  frameworks.  The  government  is  undertaking  initiatives, \nwith  support  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners,  to  promote \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in various infrastructure subsectors.6 However, both public and \nprivate  sectors  share  the  view  that  a  robust  regime  of  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory \n\n                                                 \n5  The  constituent  assembly\u2019s  extended  tenure  ends  May  2011.  A  new  government  under  Prime  Minister  Jhala  Nath \n  Khanal was sworn in on 6 February 2011. The political situation can be expected to remain uncertain for some time as \n  concluding the ongoing peace process remains challenging.   \n6  Summary  of Ongoing ADB Technical Assistance on Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Nepal (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f  3\n\nframeworks conducive for investment in infrastructure sector in Nepal is absent. There is no central \napex body to formulate PPP policies and national strategies. The project pipeline suitable for PPPs \nremains  thin,  and  while  a  number  of  line  ministries  are  pursuing  various  PPP  projects,  they  are \ndoing so without a uniform approach, and none of the projects have reached successful financial \nclosure  to  date.  Key  constraints  include  the  (i)  absence  of  a  national  PPP  policy  framework, \n(ii) weaknesses  in  key  policies  and  legislation, 7  (iii)  lack  of  information  and  guidelines  on \nappropriate risk-sharing mechanisms between public and private sectors needed to support PSP, \nand (iv) lack of reliable independent dispute resolution system. \n\nLack  of  PPP  experience  and  capacity.  Project  financing  and  PPPs  are  relatively  new \n12. \nconcepts  in  Nepal.  At  present,  key  line  ministries  (e.g.,  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and \nWorks, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Local Development) are pursuing PPP ventures, but lack \na uniform approach. Understanding of PPPs and how they can be used to spearhead infrastructure \ndevelopment  interventions  in  various  sectors  is  limited.  PPP  projects  are  being  initiated  by  some \nline  ministries,  but  to  date  none  have  attracted  private  sector  interest.  Commercial  banks  and \npublic sector entities in Nepal lack the technical and commercial skills needed to identify, appraise, \nand structure projects, even if suitable infrastructure lending was available. \n\n13. \nOpportunities.  Accelerated economic growth supported by high quality infrastructure is a \ncritical priority of the government\u2019s Three-Year Interim Plan, FY2008\u2013FY2010, and the Three-Year \nPlan Approach Paper, FY2011\u2013FY2013.8 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012,9 and the \n2009 country assistance program evaluation10 for Nepal are closely aligned with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment  plans,  and  highlight  the  importance  of  infrastructure  in  Nepal's  development  and \npoverty  reduction  efforts.  However,  the  interim  plan  concluded  without  demonstrable  progress \nagainst  its  infrastructure  goals,  and  economic  development  in  Nepal  remains  slow.  The  interim \nplan,  the  approach  paper,  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  all  recognize  the  need  for \ninnovation and diversification in Nepal\u2019s financial sector11 in order to promote much-needed private \nsector  investment  in  infrastructure  development.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation \nrecommends prioritizing assistance to infrastructure, including through a longer-term approach that \npromotes private sector investments and PPPs.  \n\n14. \nOpportunities  for  capital  market  development  and  infrastructure  financing  are  included  in \nthe  measures  initiated  by  the  government  in  support  of  the  interim  plan  and  the  approach  paper \npriorities, which include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nundertaking  a  feasibility  study  for  the  establishment  of  an  independent  debt \nmanagement office, separate from the monetary functions of the central bank;12 \nestablishing  a  central  depository  system  for  both  bonds  and  equities,  with  support \nfrom the Government of India;13 and \n\n                                                 \n7  Including  for  example,  amendments  to  the  Private  Financing  in  Build  and  Operation  of  Infrastructures  Act,  2006 \n\n(commonly referred to in Nepal as the BOOT Act). \n\n8   Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2007.

Lessons from  ADB  experience  have been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  A \nrecent special evaluation study14 of ADB support for capital market development noted the need to \ndevelop  realistic  assistance  strategies  that  take  into  account  country-specific  conditions.  Given \nNepal\u2019s political uncertainty and the limited absorptive capacity and resources of public institutions, \ndevelopment  interventions  must  be  modest  and  realistic  building  on  incremental  achievements. \nNepal\u2019s  capital  market  is  in  a  nascent  state  and  sector  institutions  are  weak;  consequently,  the \nproject focuses on fundamental aspects of financial sector development and PSP (i.e., developing \nthe  basic  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  and  market  infrastructure).  The  project  places  a \nstrong  emphasis  on  basic  but  key  aspects  of  capacity  development  that  will  ensure  the \nsustainability of reforms essential for further sector development. The project builds on past ADB \nsupport (i.e., the Corporate and Financial Governance Project),15 which helped develop the basic \nbuilding  blocks  by  supporting  (i)  the  development  of  key  financial  sector  legislation,  (ii) \nestablishment  of  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and  (iii)  improvement  of  legal \nenforcement  capacity  and  infrastructure.  The  project  design  also  benefited  from  past  technical \nassistance  on  public  debt  management 16 and  ongoing  technical  assistance  projects  for  PPPs \n(footnote 6).  \n \nImpact and Outcome  \n\nB. \n\nThe impact will be greater availability of infrastructure services.

The  three  project  outputs  aim  to \nbridge the significant and growing gaps in infrastructure financing. \n\n18. \nOutput  1:  Regulatory  and  institutional  framework  for  bond  market  development. \nGiven  the  lack  of  bond  market  development  in  Nepal,  there  is  a  need  to  first  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for the successful development of government securities market that will set the stage \nfor development of corporate debt securities.  \n\n(i) \n\nStrengthening the institutional capacity for public debt management. This will \nbe  achieved  through  (a)  developing  an  effective  institutional  arrangement  for  debt \nmanagement;  (b)  drafting  appropriate  regulations  for  establishing  a  dedicated  and \nprofessionally  managed  Public  Debt  Management  Office  (PDMO);  (c)  installing \nappropriate \nincluding \nmaintenance  and  updates  of  the  computer-based  debt  management  system; \n(d) implementing  training  programs,  including  links  with  debt  management  entities \n\ntechnology  platforms  and  analytical \n\ninformation \n\ntools, \n\n                                                 \n13 As  part  of  the  technical  assistance  agreement  (signed  in  January  2010)  between  the  Central  Depository  Services \n(India) Limited (CDSL) and Nepal Stock Exchange Limited, CDSL will also provide support for (i) finalizing operating \ninstructions; (ii) preparing business requirement specifications, evaluation and selection of vendors for hardware and \nnetworking; and (iii) carrying out User Acceptance Training for the implementation of the central depository system. \n14  ADB. 2008.

As \npart  of  its  efforts  to  establish  the  PDMO,  the  proposed  project  will  assist  in \nestablishing  a  sovereign  yield  curve  as  a  benchmark  for  pricing  private  sector \nborrowings  by  (a) helping  develop  a  reliable  issuance  calendar  that  specifies  the \nvolume  and  maturity  of  government  securities  by  the  PDMO;  and  (b)  helping \nestablish a primary dealer system by enforcing a licensing requirement, developing \na  code  of  conduct  for  primary  dealers,  and  developing  a  system  of  incentives  for \nprimary dealers to play a market-making role. \nDeveloping  the  bond  market  infrastructure.  A  central  depository  system  is \ncurrently being developed (footnote 13); however, further support will be needed to \ndraft  necessary  components  for  the  establishment  of  a  legal  framework  for  the \nsystem. \nBuilding  the  institutional  and  regulatory  capacity  of  SEBON.  To  enhance  the \nautonomy,  enforcement  powers,  and  capacity  of  SEBON,  the  project  will  (a)  draft \nrelevant regulations and amendments to key regulations, including developing best \nregional  practice  governance  norms  for  listed  companies;  and  (b)  implement  in-\ncountry capacity-building programs for SEBON and the Nepal Stock Exchange, and \nbuild links with good-practice regulatory and training institutions and other relevant \nagencies. \n\n19. \nOutput  2:  Enabling  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  greater  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure.

A project management and coordination office (PMCO) will be established in \nthe MOF, which will be the executing agency for the project. The PMCO will be headed by a full-\ntime project director and will include representatives from each implementing agency. The PMCO \nwill  be  supported  by  a  project  manager,  procurement  expert,  and  accountant.  The  PMCO's  main \nresponsibilities  include  (i)  reviewing  and  endorsing  procurement  of  goods  and  services  for  all \nproject  components,  (ii)  day-to-day  project  management  and  coordination  among  implementing \nagencies  and  other  stakeholders,  (iii) providing  timely  feedback  to  the  project  steering  committee \nand  ADB  on  matters  that  may  hamper  project  implementation,  (iv)  preparing  quarterly  progress \nreports and a project completion report, (v) consultant selection and procurement in line with ADB \npolicies, and (vi) ensuring full compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nBy  improving  the  availability  and  quality  of  infrastructure  over  the  longer  term,  the  project \n25. \nwill  contribute  directly  to  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Nepal.  Reduced  costs  and \nhigher  profitability  resulting  from  improved  infrastructure  will  enhance  private  sector  investment, \nand  thereby  expand  employment  opportunities.  Improved  transport  connectivity  and  access  to \nelectricity  and  urban  services  will  boost  economic  activity  and  significantly  improve  quality  of life, \nespecially for the poor, who are particularly impacted by the lack of infrastructure services.  \n \nA significant increase in infrastructure outlay is warranted if Nepal is to meet its growth and \n26. \npoverty  reduction  targets.  Due  to  limited  fiscal  space,  public  financing  alone  will  not  be  able  to \ngenerate  the  level  of  investment  needed  to  improve  infrastructure  facilities.  Enhancing  private \nsector  infrastructure  investments  and  minimizing  the  government's  borrowing  cost  through  the \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nPDMO  will  create  fiscal  space  for  additional  social  infrastructure  investment.  The  project  is \ndesigned  to  promote  the  commercial  viability  of  infrastructure  projects  by  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  support  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure  projects,  and  promote  greater  PSP \nthrough a robust PPP policy framework and structured project development process. Further, the \nsupport for development of demonstration PPP projects will help to gradually overcome the lack of \nexperience and technical and commercial skills required for identifying, appraising, and structuring \nPPP  projects.  This  will  complement  ADB  efforts  to  promote  PSP,  including  through  PPPs  in  the \ntransport, urban, and energy sectors. \n \nThrough  bond  market  development,  the  project  will  help  increase  the  competitiveness, \n27. \nefficiency,  and  stability  of  Nepal\u2019s  financial  system  by  (i)  reducing  overreliance  by  the  public  and \ncorporate  sectors  on  short-term  bank  loans  and  foreign  borrowings  by  mitigating  maturity  and \ncurrency mismatches in their portfolios and thereby enhancing the stability of the financial system; \n(ii) enabling long-term capital for long-term investments and asset creation, such as infrastructure, \nto  be  raised  efficiently;  and  (iii)  facilitating  efficient  financing  of  the  government  budget  from \nnonbank  sources  and  thereby  improving  risk  management  of  public  debt.  The  development  of  a \nbroad-based  financial  sector  through  capital  market  development  will  reduce  vulnerability  to \nfinancial crises, which often have significant adverse growth and poverty impacts. \n \nB. \n \nProject-specific  governance  risks  have  been  analyzed  by  carrying  out  a  governance  risk \n28. \nassessment in line with the requirements of ADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan.19 In  recent  years,  the  government  has  taken  a  number  of  initiatives  to  address  corruption, \nincluding  the  Promoting  Market  Competition  Act,  2006;  Right  to  Information  Act,  2007;  Special \nCourt Act, 2002 (amended in 2007); and Anti-Money-Laundering Act, 2008. The government has \nalso  passed  the  Public  Procurement  Act,  2007,  and  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations,  2007; \nwhich  are  both  generally  acceptable  to  ADB  and  encompass  best  international  procurement \npractices.  The  government  has  also  established  a  \u201cprocurement  watchdog\u201d  in  the  form  of  the \nPublic  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of \nMinisters.  Furthermore,  it  has  established  the  National  Vigilance  Centre  under  the  direct \nsupervision  and  control  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  control  corruption  through  preventive  measures. \nThe project support for bond market development, private infrastructure investments, and capacity \nbuilding  will  also  enhance  governance  in  the  respective  fields.  Corruption  risks  in  the  project  are \nnot expected to be severe.  \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith,  the  government  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.20  \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  one  of  general  intervention.  It  will  help  create  an  enabling \nenvironment\u2014policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional\u2014for  increased  investments  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  with  an  aim  to  attract  private  sector  investments  through  PPPs.  Development  of \npriority infrastructure, such as hydropower, transport, and water supply will not only promote overall \neconomic  growth  (which  is  critical  for  poverty  reduction)  but  will  also  help  improve  access  to \neconomic  and  social  services.  Greater  business  opportunities  from  increased  public  and  private \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2006.  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.  Manila.  The  action  plan  focuses  on  risks  in  public \nfinancial management, procurement, and anticorruption (A Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan is accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n20  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f  9\n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\ninvestments  will  generate  employment  opportunities  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  thereby \nbenefiting the poor, women, and excluded sections of the population.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \n31. \nimpact on indigenous peoples. Adverse impacts of the proposed policy and regulatory reform and \ncapacity  building  activities  in  the  project  are  unlikely.  However,  although  no  direct  environmental \nand  resettlement  implications  are  expected,  there  could  be  future  impacts  through  the  proposed \ndevelopment of PPP infrastructure projects. Consequently, the project will help the line ministries \nresponsible  for  the  development  of  the  selected  PPP  projects  (i)  address  the  potential \nenvironmental and resettlement issues arising from investments in the infrastructure projects in line \nwith  the  safeguard  policies  of  ADB  and  the  government;  and  (ii) internalize  and  streamline  these \nissues  in  the  project  activities,  particularly  in  the  training  programs,  operational  manuals,  and \nbusiness plans.  \n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n32. \nThe  overall  implementation  risk  of  the  project  is  considered  low  if  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place.  Although  the  ongoing  political  transition  and  associated  instability  are \napparent risks to reform and development in any sector, risks to this project are limited. All political \nparties  in  Nepal  consider  financial  sector  reforms  and  infrastructure  development  important  to \nachieving  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  implementing  agencies  in  the  project  are  the  MOF \nand  the  financial  regulators  (NRB  and  SEBON),  and  therefore  there  is  significant  government \nownership of, and commitment to, the project. ADB will engage with the government to ensure that \nits  commitment  to  relevant  reforms  remains  high.  Other  risks  and  their  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.21 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nKey Risks \nWeak project implementation and the lack of \ncoordination across relevant agencies. The \nproject covers three components with activities \ninvolving a number of implementing agencies \nhaving capacity constraints. There is also a risk \nthat there may not be close coordination during \nimplementation.  \n\nLack of institutional capacity and skills base \nrequired for project sustainability. The \ninstitutional capacity in financial and public debt \nmanagement in Nepal is low and availability of \nlocal expertise is limited. The government may \nalso not be able to allocate the required level of \nresources for the needed reforms. The capacity \nconstraint constitutes a type-1 risk to the projecta    \n \n \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProject implementation oversight and coordination will be provided \nby a high-level project steering committee, with a PMCO established \nin the MOF as well. The PMCO will be headed by a full-time project \ndirector supported by national consultants to support and build \ncapacity with the EA and IAs.  The PMCO will also be tasked with \nadvising on proper sequencing of reforms and capacity-building \nactivities in the project.  The project team will also engage in regular \ndialogues with IAs to monitor progress and management of \nexpected deliverables. \nThe project focuses on capacity building throughout all three \ncomponents. Consulting services will be primarily for hands-on work \nand helping in implementation as well as transferring knowledge to \nlocal counterparts (and only to a lesser extent for additional studies \nand review). Knowledge-sharing, training, and certification programs \nwill be developed through linkages with reputable training \ninstitutions. ADB will engage with the government to ensure that \nresources and reforms are adequate. \n\n                                                 \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The plan \nalso  briefly  discusses the review of the peace filter, and that of the disaster and climate change screening tool,  with \nrespect to project design. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nKey Risks \nLack of proper sequencing of PPP policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory reforms. Proper \nsequencing of reforms is critical for creating an \nenabling PPP environment and successful \ndevelopment of the proposed demonstration PPP \nproject as well as other projects in the future. \nWithout the proper PPP framework in place, \ntransactions on demonstration projects may not \nmaterialize.  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EA  =  executing  agencies,  IA  =  implementing  agencies,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance, \nPMCO = project management and coordination office, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \na  Type-1  risks  must  be  addressed  through  specific  risk-mitigation  strategies  that  are  in  place  prior  to  project \nimplementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nThe project design allows for possible delays in implementation of \nthe policy reform actions envisaged in the project due to possible \npolitical disruptions, and provides adequate time for reform actions. \nMost of the reform actions do not require approval of the legislature, \nwhich can be time-consuming in the current environment. Activities \nrelating to the demonstration PPP project development (component \n3) have been carefully sequenced with related policy reforms under \ncomponent 2. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n33. \nThe government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the project administration manual and grant documents. \n\nThe government and the Ministry of Finance have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\n34. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$5,000,000 to Nepal from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Capital Market and Infrastructure \nCapacity Support Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft grant and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident   \n\n28 March 2011\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n \n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nGreater availability of \ninfrastructure services  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines1 \n\n \nAt least 3 infrastructure projects \nhaving private sector, foreign \ndirect investments, or \ncommercial financing by 2017/18 \n(2009 baseline: nil) \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOutcome \nGreater private sector \ninvestment in the \ninfrastructure sector \n\n \nAt least one PPP project reached \nfinancial closure by 2014/15 \n(2011 baseline: nil)   \n\nOutputs  \n1.
