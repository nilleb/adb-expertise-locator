It is expected that these cities will become economic centers in northern Viet Nam \nto complement Ha Noi.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRegional  economic  corridor.  The  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  (NSEC),  which \nconnects Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries and the southeastern People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  (PRC),  is  a  dynamic  area  of  development.  The  eastern  branch  of  the  NSEC, \nconnecting  Kunming  (Yunnan  Province,  PRC)  and  Nanning  (Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous \nRegion,  PRC)  to  Ha  Noi  and  northern  Viet  Nam,  is  experiencing  rapid  growth  arising  from \nforeign direct investments, cross-border trade, and flows of goods and people. Increased traffic \nand  trade  along  the  NSEC  has  resulted  in  tremendous  development  pressures  on  urban  areas \nalong the corridor. The transformation of the NSEC into a full-fledged economic corridor requires \nthat these urban areas can function as nodes of economic activity and growth centers, linking their \nhinterlands and the outlying region. Local economic development in corridor cities will benefit the \nNSEC and vice versa. However, the sprawl of settlements along the NSEC is largely uncontrolled, \nleading to additional infrastructure costs and degraded environmental conditions.  \n \nSecondary  cities.  The  metropolitan  areas  that  receive  large  inflows  of  migrants  are \n4. \nbecoming  more  congested,  and  are  experiencing  increasingly  serious  social  and  environmental \nproblems.  At  the  same  time,  secondary  cities  are  stagnating.  If  the  neglect  of  secondary  city \ndevelopment  continues,  the  resulting  spatial  and  economic  disparities  will  further  constrain  not \nonly urban development, but also social stability and Viet Nam\u2019s overall economic development. In \nline with the government decentralization policy, targeted infrastructure investments in secondary \ncities  will  help  attract  or  retain  residents,  possibly  reducing  migration  to  the  large  metropolitan \ncities.  The  diversion  away  from these  metropolitan  areas  and  the  potential  inducement  to foster \ngrowth in secondary cities would result in more balanced regional development. \n \n5. \nUrban issues. The main challenges facing corridor cities as well as secondary cities arise \nfrom  lack  of  urban  infrastructure  investments  and  the  limited  ability  of  local  governments  to \nprovide reliable and affordable urban services. Absence of links between the local socioeconomic \ndevelopment  plan,  spatial  plan,  and  master  plans  for  urban  subsectors  is  the  major  challenge \nfacing  urban  development  and  management.  Inability  to  recover  cost  for  municipal  service \nprovision causes poor operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure. This results in missing \nlinks  in  the  road  network,  obsolete  water  supply  systems  and  high  water  losses,  floods  and \nclogged  drains,  as  well  as  uncontrolled  disposal  of  untreated  wastes  that  contaminate  the \nproductive capacity of cities, making them less competitive and livable. Lack of infrastructure and \nlimited  capacity  to  manage  urban  services  discourage  external  investments  that  are  critical  to \nsocioeconomic development and growth. \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProject cities. Three urban areas were selected as the project cities: Viet Tri in Phu Tho \n6. \nProvince,  Hung  Yen  in  Hung  Yen  Province,  and  Dong  Dang  in  Lang  Son  Province.  They  are \nlocated along the NSEC outside Ha Noi, and classified secondary cities in northern Viet Nam. \n \nViet Tri. With good potential to become a logistics hub in northern Viet Nam, Viet Tri is the \n7. \ncapital  of  Phu  Tho  Province  and  located  about  84  kilometers  (km)  northwest  of  Ha  Noi,  just \noutside  the  administrative  border  of  Greater  Ha  Noi. 3  Viet  Tri  has  sound  access  to  various \ntransport  modes.  Three  rivers  (Red  River,  Da  River,  and  Lo  River)  meet  at  Viet  Tri  where  they \nmerge  into  Red  River,  which  flows  into  Ha  Noi.  The  city  is  located  along  the  railway  and \nexpressway connecting the Noi Bai international airport and Lao Cai, a border city with the PRC. \nThe  distance  between  Viet  Tri  and  the  Noi  Bai  international  airport  is  about  50  km.  Strategic \nplanning and investments in public infrastructure development are necessary for Viet Tri to grow \nas a regional logistics hub for efficient distribution of goods. \n \n8. \nHung Yen. Located between Ha Noi and Hai Phong (62 km to Ha Noi and 108 km to Hai \nPhong), Hung Yen is the capital of Hung Yen Province. Within Hung Yen City is an old town with a \nnumber  of  historical  relics.  In  the  15th\u201316th  century,  the  city  was  an  important  center  for \ncommerce and trade through its river port. The government has started preserving a number of \nold  buildings  that  have  historical  value.  Further  improvements  in  access  and  environmental \ninfrastructure  in  the  old  town  are  expected  to  attract  tourists.  Another  potential  area  for \ndevelopment  in  Hung  Yen  is  the  university  zone.  Chu  Van  An  University  is  currently  being \nconstructed,  while  Transport  University  and  Foreign  Trade  University  are  preparing  to  open \ncampuses in Hung Yen. \n \n9. \nDong  Dang. The Huu Nghi border gate in Dong Dang handles about 70% of freight and \npassenger  transits  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  along  the  NSEC.  While  total  trade  in  this \nborder  gate  was  valued  at  $859  million,  the  volume  of  passengers  was  recorded  at \n710,606 people in 2010. Since 2000, annual growth rose by an average of 18% in trade and 15% \nin passengers. Trade volume in 2020 is expected to rise to about 10.2 million tons, or $2.78 billion \nin  terms  of  value.  Total passenger traffic  is  expected  to  reach  1.4  million  in  the  same  year. It  is \nclear  that  the  existing  capacity  of  the  Huu  Nghi  border  gate  will  not  be  able  to  handle  such \nexpected increases in trade and passenger traffic. \n \nRelated policies and strategies. The project is in line with Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic \n10. \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010, which envisions Viet Nam as an industrialized country by 2020.4 \nIn the orientation master plan for urban development to 2020, the government aims to develop \nmodel  cities  and  divert  rural  migration  away  from  the  large  cities  through  the  development  of \nsecondary cities and strengthening of rural\u2013urban linkages.5 The project will address the GMS \nstrategy to transform transport corridors into full-fledged economic corridors as identified in the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  regional  cooperation  operations  business  plan  for  the \nGMS.6 ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for Viet Nam emphasizes the need \nto  target  infrastructure  investments  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities,  particularly  those  along \nthe  GMS  economic  corridors.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  set  forth  in  the \nassessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  urban  development  in  Viet  Nam.  It  falls  under  two \npriority areas: (i) development of corridor cities and towns to contribute to the transformation of \nGMS  regional  transport  corridors  into  full-fledged  economic  corridors,  and  (ii)   development  of \nsecondary cities and towns as regional economic hubs to foster balanced regional development \n                                                \n3  The administrative area of Ha Noi was substantially expanded to include the entire Ha Tay Province and Me Linh \n\nDistrict of Vinh Phuc Province. \n\n4   Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2006.

The  project  design  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport  Initiative, Water  Policy,  and  draft  urban  operational  plan  under  Strategy \n2020.7 \n \nLessons.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  urban  development  include  (i) reducing \n11. \nimplementation delays by (a) shortening procurement, (b) strengthening the capacity and skills \nof the government project staff, (c) reducing project start-up time, and (d) shortening the time for \nrevising  and  finalizing  designs  and  bidding  documents;  (ii)  improving  consultant  quality  by \ncombining  international  technical  capacity  with  local  experience;  (iii)  preparing  more  judicious \ncovenants;  (iv)  strengthening  risk  analysis;  and  (v)  employing  comprehensive  corporate  and \nbusiness planning as a tool for communicating and agreeing on capacity building.8 The lessons \nwere studied during project preparation and  incorporated in the project design. \n \nSpecial  features. The project has been designed in accordance with the government\u2019s \n12. \npolicy  to  decentralize  the  implementation  of  projects  and  programs  funded  by  official \ndevelopment  assistance.  The  provincial  and  city  governments  will  be  primarily  responsible  for \nproject  planning  and  implementation.  Infrastructure  improvement  in  the  old  town  in  Hung  Yen \nwill  complement  the  government\u2019s  efforts  for  historic  building  preservation  and  catalyze \ncomprehensive  redevelopment  of  the  old  town.  This  approach  could  be  replicated  in  other \nhistoric  cities  if  successful.  Upgrading  of  the  Huu  Nghi  border  gate  facilities  will  create  great \neconomic  impact  through  increased  trade,  investments,  and  passenger  traffic  between \nViet Nam and the PRC. The project will contribute not only to the local economy, but also to the \ncountry\u2019s overall economy. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe impact will be the development of Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and Dong Dang as economic \ncenters  in  northern  Viet  Nam  to  complement  Ha  Noi.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in Viet Tri, Hung Yen, and Dong Dang. \n \nC. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe project will deliver the following outputs in the three project cities. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nViet Tri urban roads. The project will construct and improve the western part of \nthe city ring road from the northern dike road to the southern dike road, including \ntwo road sections, which accounts for about one-third of the total city ring road. It \nwill also build a new road from the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai expressway to the city center. \nThe new and improved roads will enhance connections between the Noi Bai\u2013Lao \nCai  expressway,  Thuy  Van  industrial  zone,  and  city  center,  as  well  as  reduce \ntraffic congestion in the central area by diverting the traffic from National Road 2 \nto the city ring road. \n\nViet Tri solid waste management. The project will provide fleet and equipment \nfor collecting solid waste from households and transporting them to the dump site, \nincreasing the current collection volume of 120 tons/day to 150 tons/day. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2010.

The project will upgrade basic infrastructure \nthrough  improvement  of  narrow  and  unpaved  roads  with  provision  of  water \nsupply,  wastewater collection and drainage pipes, and utility ducts for electricity \nand telecommunications. This approach could be replicated in the remaining part \nof the old town and other cities that have historic townscape in Viet Nam. \n\nHung  Yen  urban  road. The project will construct approximately 3.3 km road to \nserve  the  proposed  campuses  for  Chu  Van  An  University,  Foreign  Trade \nUniversity, and Transport University, as well as to attract other universities. The \nroad  will  also  serve  as  an  access  road  for  the  residential  areas  currently  being \ndeveloped. \n\nDong  Dang  Huu  Nghi  border  gate.  This  output  aims  to  improve  handling  of \nimmigration and emigration of cross-border passengers, and custom clearance of \ngoods for import and export at the Huu Nghi border gate. The project will build (a) \noffice  buildings  and \nthe  office  buildings;  and \n(b) infrastructure  of  the  Huu  Nghi  border  gate  such  as  roads,  including  the \nVietnamese  section  of  the  connecting  road  between  the  Vietnamese  and \nChinese border gates for transportation of goods, drainage, and parking areas.  \n\nfootbridges  connecting \n\nDong  Dang  drainage  and  flood  protection.  The  project  will  increase  the \ncapacity of drainage pipelines currently laid along one side of the roads. Flooding \nis  a  common  occurrence  during  heavy  rainfall,  severely  disrupting  market \nactivities. \n\nImplementation  support,  capacity  development,  and  awareness  building. \nThe project will (a) help ensure that project implementation will fully comply with \nADB\u2019s  policies  and  operational  requirements  in  terms  of  detailed  designs, \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  disbursement,  financial  management, \nand  social  and  environmental  safeguards;  (b)  design  and  conduct  capacity \ndevelopment programs in urban planning and management, public infrastructure \nplanning and implementation, operation and maintenance, financial management \nand  cost  recovery,  and  environmental  management;  (c)  help  local  communities \nincrease  awareness  of  public  health,  environmental  management,  and  traffic \nsafety; and (d) assist in analytical studies on specific topics including a long-term \nresidential land development plan for Viet Tri, a detailed master plan for the old \ntown  in  Hung  Yen,  and  potential  for  public\u2013private  partnership  at  the  Huu  Nghi \nborder gate facilities in Dong Dang. \n\n \n15. \nHung  Yen  wastewater  treatment  and  network.  The  government  has  also  requested \nthe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  for  a  loan  from  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea \n(KEXIM)  to  provide  (i)  a  wastewater  treatment  plant,  (ii)  three  pumping  stations,  (iii)  a  sewer \nnetwork, and (iv) maintenance machinery and equipment. These activities will be implemented in \nparallel  with  the  project  and  contribute  together  to  the  urban  environmental  improvement  in \nHung Yen. Safeguard documentation, consultation, and disclosure for the KEXIM-financed output \nwill  be  conducted  to  satisfy  both  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  safeguard \nrequirements of KEXIM. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $115.33 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\frequested  a \n\nThe  government  has \n\nto \n17. \nSDR45,017,000 ($70.00 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project.

The technology for undertaking such works is within the capacity of \nthe  local  government  agencies  assigned  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  them.  The  civil \nworks  implementation  is  focused  on  quality  rather  than  the  quantity  of  coverage.  The  designs \nand  the  operation  and  maintenance  plan  are  prepared  based  on  appropriate  standards  to \nensure sustainability. \n \nGovernment  policy  changes  have  been  made  toward  decentralization  to  delegate \n22. \nresponsibilities  from  the  government  to  the  provinces  in  planning  and  management  of  local \nbudget  and  human  resources,  as  well  as  land  use,  public  service  delivery,  state  enterprise \nbusiness,  and  natural  resource  control.  The  new  Urban  Planning  Law,  2009  stipulates \ndecentralization  of  urban  planning  responsibilities  to  include  all  government  administration \nlevels  and  to  require  stakeholder  consultation  with  concerned  organizations,  individuals,  and \ncommunities. A major challenge is the lack of capacity of local authorities to plan and manage \nurban  growth  in  an  integrated  manner,  plan  and  operate  urban  infrastructure  effectively,  and \ndeliver  municipal  services  efficiently.  The  project  will  help  strengthen  the  capacities  of  local \ngovernments, thus supporting the government\u2019s decentralization policy. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  all  seven  physical  outputs  because  of  the \nuniqueness  of  each.  In  undertaking  the  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  a  variety  of  benefit  evaluation \nmethods  were  used,  including  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time,  (ii) \nincreased  agricultural  productivity,  (iii)  increased  tourism  revenue,  (iv)  increased  border  fee \nrevenue  and  reduced  border  clearance  time,  (v)  revenues  from  sale  of  waste,  (vi)  savings  on \nwater  provision,  and  (vii)  other  methods.  Given  the  variety  of  the  outputs,  the  expected \nbeneficiaries  of  the  overall  project  also  constitute  a  diverse  group.  They  include  road  users, \nfarmers,  university  students  and  teachers,  tourism  service  providers,  property  owners,  and \nhouseholds.  The  base  case  results  indicate  all  outputs  are  economically  viable  with  an \nestimated economic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of \ncapital  of  12%,  with  the  exception  of  one  output  which  was  marginally  below  that  threshold. \nResults ranged from 11.4% to 18.1%, except for the Dong Dang Huu Nghi border gate in which \nthe  rate  of  return  was  estimated  to  be  significantly  higher.  Outputs  were  generally  also  viable \nunder adverse scenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower (by 10% or 20%) than the \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nbase case. All of the 29 scenarios tested showed an estimated rate of return above 12%, except \nin four cases where the return was between 9.9% and 11.2%. \n \n24. \nGiven  that  the  project  is  nonrevenue  generating,  the  financial  analysis  focused  on  the \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  financial  capacity  to  meet  the  recurrent  costs  of  operating  and \nmaintaining  the  developed  facilities  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  overall  financial  position  of \neach  implementing  agency  was  projected,  reflecting  the  incremental  recurrent  costs.  The \nprojected  financial  positions  confirm  their  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  recurrent  costs  to \nsustain  the  facilities  developed  under  the  project.  Moreover,  considering  the  government\u2019s \nassurance  that  it  will  fund  the  operating  expenditure  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the  project \nfacilities,  adequate  budgetary  amount  for  recurrent  costs  for  operation  and  maintenance  is \nreasonably expected. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  financial  management  assessments  reveal  no  serious  obstacles  with  the  accounting \npolicies  and  procedures  followed  by  the  PPCs  and  CPCs.  Based  on  the  procurement  capacity \nassessments, the executing and implementing agencies are deemed to have sufficient capacity to \nundertake national competitive bidding for civil works packages. However, considering that they do \nnot  have  much  experience  in  managing  externally  funded  projects,  the  project  has  incorporated \ncapacity  development  programs  for  relevant  staff  in  financial  management,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith the government and the PPCs of Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Lang Son. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.14 \n \nD. \n \n27. \nPotential  social  impacts  on  communities  within  the  project  areas  have  been  assessed. \nThe  social  assessment  indicates  that  the  project  presents  risks  with  respect  to  livelihoods, \nHIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  participation,  and  road  safety.  The  project  also \npresents  social  and  economic  benefits  to  local  communities  in  the  form  of  improved  mobility, \neconomic  opportunities,  social  development,  and  improved  local  environments.  A  poverty \nreduction and social strategy was prepared to present mitigation measures needed to address \nsocial impacts and enhance distribution of benefits resulting from the project. \n \n28. \nThe  project  is  categorized  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  analysis \nconcluded that women in the project area are at risk of being disproportionately disadvantaged \nby  the  project  impacts, or  not  realizing  the full  potential  of  project  benefits  and opportunities if \ngender issues are not mainstreamed in project activities. Accordingly, a gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared  to  (i)  ensure  gender  issues  are  mainstreamed  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation,  (ii)  address  specific  impacts  and  risks  that  may  affect  women  differently  or \ndisproportionately  compared  to  men,  (iii)  enhance  participation  of  women  in  project  benefits, \nand (iv) build the capacity of the Women\u2019s Union in the project areas to support implementation \nof social development activities of the project. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nthe  new  road  developments,  drainage  and \n\nE. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  B.  This  means  that  potential \nenvironmental impacts of project outputs are relatively minor and can be prevented or mitigated. \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each project city. An environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  is  included  with  each  IEE.  The  IEEs  indicate  that  potential  direct \nenvironmental  impacts  are  mostly  construction-related  and  thus  short-lived.  Environmental \nimpacts  associated  with \nflood  protection, \ninfrastructure upgrading in the old town, and Huu Nghi border gate facilities can be prevented or \nmitigated  with  standard  construction  procedures  and  measures.  Similarly,  the  construction  of \nthe new wastewater treatment plant in Hung Yen will follow existing construction practices and \nnorms, and will be operated following existing government standards and guidelines for treated \neffluent discharge and solid waste management. During project implementation, the EMPs will \nbe implemented by the PIUs in conjunction with contractors under the direction of the PIUs. The \nPIUs  have  adequate  capacity  and  experience  and  are  committed  to  manage  environmental \nrisks. Furthermore, project implementation support and a capacity development program will be \nprovided for the PIUs for implementing the EMPs. \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement  category  A.  The  project  will \nrequire  the  acquisition  of  approximately  97  hectares  (ha)  of  land  in  the  three  project  cities, \ncomprising  73  ha  in Viet  Tri,  17  ha  in Hung Yen,  and 7  ha  in  Dong Dang. This  will  cause the \nphysical and/or economic displacement of an estimated 1,451 households. A resettlement plan \nwas prepared for each project city to address resettlement impacts associated with the project\u2019s \nland  acquisition  requirements  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The \nacquisition of land for the Huu Nghi border gate facilities in Dong Dang commenced prior to the \nproject  in accordance  with the government\u2019s  legislation and  practices. The  project  will  need  to \nensure that the Safeguard Policy Statement is also met with respect to involuntary resettlement \nfrom  this  site.  A  resettlement  due  diligence  study  was  undertaken  of  the  affected  land  at \nHuu Nghi  border  gate  and  a  corrective  action  plan  was  prepared  to  set  out  supplementary \nactions required to ensure that involuntary resettlement from this location is in compliance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  under  indigenous  peoples  category  B.  The  presence  of  and \n31. \npotential  project  activity  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  and/or  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project \nareas have been screened. A large proportion of the people in the project area in Dong Dang \nare ethnic minorities who will be affected in a number of ways by the project, while there are no \nethnic  minorities  in  Viet  Tri  and  Hung  Yen.  In  Dong  Dang,  the  construction  of  the  river \nembankment  for  flood  protection,  as  well  as  Huu  Nghi  border  gate  facilities,  will  require  land \nacquisition and produce displacement. The vendors at Dong Dang market will likely experience \ntemporary disruptions to their livelihoods as a result of drainage civil  works. There are risks of \nHIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking to the local ethnic minority population. The project \nalso presents benefits and opportunities to the local population. An ethnic minority development \nplan, in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, has been prepared to fully mitigate the \nrisks and impacts caused to ethnic minorities in the project area in Dong Dang and to promote \ntheir participation and sharing in project benefits. \n \n32. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the \nsafeguard documents are posted on ADB\u2019s website. A grievance redress mechanism has been \ndeveloped  and  included  in  the  safeguard  documents  to  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints \nregarding the performance of the project. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe  key  project  risks  include  (i)  limited  economic  development  in  the  project  cities,  (ii) \ncatastrophic climate events (typhoons and flooding), (iii) limited project implementation capacity, \nand (iv) complex project implementation arrangements. The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk management plan.15 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited economic development  in \nproject cities \n\nProject facilities damaged by natural \ndisasters such as typhoons and flooding \n\nMitigating Measures \nProject outputs have been identified based on an urban and regional \nanalysis to ensure that they support a well-defined city development \nstrategy in each project city. \nThe use of robust designs and good construction quality control will \nreduce the vulnerability of the urban infrastructure to catastrophic climate \nevents. \nThe project preparatory TA will provide start-up support, and the loan \nconsultants will provide capacity strengthening and training for local \ngovernment agencies. \nOne team of the loan consultants will be engaged to assist all PIUs in \nproject implementation to facilitate effective coordination. \n\nLimited implementation capacities at the \nprovincial and city levels to meet all \nADB and project requirements \nComplexity in coordinating many PIUs \ninvolved in project implementation \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project design and monitoring framework \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  the  PPCs  of  Phu  Tho,  Hung  Yen,  and  Lang  Son  have  assured \n34. \nADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan \ndocuments. \n \n35. \nThe government and the PPCs of Phu Tho, Hung Yen, and Lang Son have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n36. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR45,017,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the \nComprehensive  Socioeconomic  Urban  Development  Project  in  Viet  Tri,  Hung  Yen,  and  Dong \nDang,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;
