The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its capacity as the mandated lead \narranger (MLA), has mobilized commercial banks and other development finance institutions to \nprovide long-term, United States (US) dollar limited-recourse project financing unavailable in the \nlocal market. The project will be one of the first and largest wind farms financed by the private \nsector in Viet Nam and will increase the country\u2019s wind capacity by nearly 30%.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Electricity demand in Viet Nam has grown at a compound annual \nrate of 13% since 2000 and is projected to grow at 8% annually through 2030.2 Meeting this power \ndemand would require an expansion in generation capacity from 48.7 gigawatts (GW) in 2018 to \n100 GW by 2030, as well as alternatives to carbon-intensive power projects to avoid significant \nincreases  in  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions. 3 The  Revised  National  Power  Development \nMaster Plan for the 2011\u20132020 Period with the Vision to 2030 (Revised PDP 7) sought to increase \nthe  share  of  wind  generation  capacity  to  2,000  MW  by  2025,  and  6,000  MW  by  2030.4 The \nNational Power Development Master Plan for the 2021\u20132030 Period with the Vision to 2050 (PDP \n8) is being finalized and is expected to further prioritize renewable energy.5 \n \n4. \nIn 2011 Viet Nam introduced a feed-in tariff (FIT) of $0.0780 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and \na standard power purchase agreement (PPA) template for utility-scale wind power projects,6 but \nfrom 2011 to 2018 only three wind power projects with a total capacity of 153.2 MW had reached \ncommercial operation.7 The limited success was because of two key factors: (i) the FIT level was \nnot  deemed  sufficient  by  project  developers  and  financiers  and (ii)  the  standard  PPA  was  not \nconsidered bankable for international lenders on a non-recourse project finance basis. In contrast, \nsince Viet Nam introduced a FIT of $0.0935/kWh in 2017 for utility-scale solar power projects, \nabout 8.9 GW of solar capacity had been commissioned by September 2020, which far exceeded \n\n \n\n1  As of 2019, the total installed onshore and offshore wind power capacity stood at 490 MW.

Under the Revised PDP 7, renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass, \nand small hydropower plants with a capacity of less than 30MW, which are separate from larger and multipurpose \nhydropower plants (classified as hydropower). \n\n5  The PDP 8 is expected to be announced publicly in the second half of 2021. \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2011.

Ha Noi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe targets under the Revised PDP 7.8 Most of these were financed by local banks, which have \nnot  expressed  the  same  level  of  interest  in  financing  wind  power  projects  because  of  their \nunfamiliarity with the technology and the greater complexity of wind power projects. \n \nTo spur interest in wind power development, Viet Nam increased the FIT to $0.085/kWh \n5. \nfor onshore wind projects in 2018. To qualify for this FIT, the commercial operation date must be \nbefore 1 November 2021.9 Viet Nam also revised the standard wind PPA template in early 2019 \nto improve its bankability, including termination payments, which had previously been identified \nas a key project inhibitor by potential financiers.10 In response to these positive developments, a \nlocal  project  developer,  Power  Construction  Joint  Stock  Company  No.  1  (PCC1),  approached \nADB in 2019 seeking long-term US dollar financing for the project. The project stood out among \nthe many proposals presented to ADB for its significant size; its ideal location with strong wind \nresources;  and  PCC1\u2019s  extensive  experience  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  infrastructure  sector  and \ncommitment to provide comprehensive sponsor support, which addresses key shortcomings of \nthe PPA.11  \n \nGender  context.  Viet  Nam  has  made  considerable  progress  in  addressing  gender \n6. \ndisparities.  However,  women\u2019s  economic  opportunities  remain  constrained  due  to  a  persistent \ngender pay gap, significant segregation of men and women in terms of occupation and industry \nof employment, an unequal burden of unpaid care work, and general resistance to women taking \nup leadership positions.12 In 2019, women represented 27% of employees in the utilities sector \nand 16% of management positions in Viet Nam.13 Likewise, in the renewable energy sector, only \na small proportion of women are in management, technical, and field-based roles, with the highest \nconcentrations  of  women  in  administration,  finance,  and  human  resources.  This  project \nincorporates gender measures that seek to support the closing of these gaps. \n \n7. \nProject design. The project entails the development, construction, and operation of three \n48 MW wind farms (144 MW in total) and the internal transmission lines in Quang Tri Province, to \nbe implemented under three 20-year PPAs with Vietnam Electricity (EVN). The project is expected \nto be commissioned in phases from May to September 2021. \n \n8. \nBorrowers. The three borrowers\u2014Lien Lap, Phong Huy, and Phong Nguyen\u2014are owned \nby  PCC1,  Renova,  Inc.

PCC1 is a domestic leader in the power infrastructure sector in Viet Nam with \nmore than 50 years of experience. It specializes in constructing power transmission networks and \nhas  interests  in  industrial  manufacturing,  energy,  real  estate,  and  consulting  services.  In \nparticular, PCC1 is one of the largest hydropower developers in Viet Nam with seven operating \nprojects  with  a  total  capacity  of  168  MW,  two  of  which  were  financed  by  the  World  Bank. 14 \n\n \n\n8  The Revised PDP 7 targets 850 MW solar power by 2020, 4,000 MW by 2025, and 12,000 MW by 2030. \n9  Government of Viet Nam. 2018.

The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  not  had  a \nmaterial impact on the cost or implementation of the project. The progress is as scheduled. The \nproject will contribute to meeting the energy demand of Viet Nam in its post-COVID-19 recovery. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nImpacts. The project will be one of the first and largest wind power projects in Viet Nam. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: the share of power produced from renewable \nenergy sources in the power generation mix in Viet Nam increased to more than 10% by 2030 \nand the wind power capacity increased to 6,000 MW (2.1% of the total) by 2030 (footnote 4). \n \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to the \n14. \ndomestic grid increased. It will generate an average of 422 gigawatt-hours of electricity from wind \nenergy and avoid an average of 162,430 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. \n \nOutputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) wind power plants of 144 MW total \n15. \ncapacity  installed,  (ii)  gender-inclusive  local  employment  generated,  (iii)  growth  of  the  local \neconomy  supported,  (iv)  gender  inclusiveness  in  PCC1\u2019s  work  environment  improved,  and \n(v) livelihood opportunities of women enhanced. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nC. \n \n16. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which has a target of 75% of ADB operations supporting climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030.18 The project supports three of the seven operational priorities: \n(i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) addressing remaining poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities.  It  further  contributes  to  three  other  objectives  of  Strategy  2030: \n(i) expanding private sector operations to reach one-third of ADB operations in number by 2024, \n(ii)  reaching  $80 billion  of  cumulative  climate finance from  ADB\u2019s  own resources from  2019  to \n\n \n\n15 PCC1\u2019s market capitalization was about $192 million as of January 2021. \n16 Renova\u2019s market capitalization was about $3.5 billion as of January 2021. \n17 ADB. 2003.

The project is aligned with two of the \nthree pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam,  2016\u20132020: (i) increasing the \ninclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery and (ii) improving environmental sustainability \nand climate change response. The project also supports the alignment of the country partnership \nstrategy with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange of a reduction of 8%\u201325% in GHG emissions by 2030.19 \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which (i) aims to prioritize and broaden support for renewable energy \nprojects and (ii) encourages private sector participation.20 The project will contribute to the targets \nfor wind generation capacity in Viet Nam\u2019s Revised PDP 7 (para. 3). Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d \napproach,  the  project  has  benefited  from  close  cross-departmental  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department in assessing and analyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \n19. \nLessons from previous operations. The project follows ADB\u2019s prior approvals of (i) the \nfirst  floating  solar  project  in  Viet  Nam,  the  Floating  Solar  Energy  Project  (2018);  and  (ii)  two \nground-mount  solar  projects,  the  Gulf  Solar  Power  Project  (2019)  and  the  B.Grimm  Viet  Nam \nSolar Power Project (Phu Yen Project) (2020).21 The project further builds on results and lessons \nfrom the cooperation between ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and the government for energy \nsector reform.22 Based on these previous operations, ADB developed a comprehensive sponsor \nsupport package where PCC1 will be liable for any debt service shortfalls if the borrowers fail to \ngenerate  sufficient  cash  flows  for  any  reason,  including  but  not  limited  to  (i)  curtailment  or \nnonpayment by EVN, (ii) retroactive changes in FIT, and (iii) technical issues in the operation of \nthe  wind  farms.  This structure  partially  mitigates  the  imperfections of the  PPA,  which provides \ncomfort to ADB and its cofinancing partners and maximizes the amount of cofinancing with the \nminimum possible ADB commitment. \n\n \n\n20. \nClimate  change  financing.  The  total  ADB  A  loan  and  cofinancing  amount  of  up  to \n$172,000,000  will  be  counted  as  climate  change  financing  (mitigation)  because  it matches  the \ncriteria according to the joint Multilateral Development Banks methodology.23 \n \nD. \n \n21. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n19 ADB.  2016.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\nThe project will be constructed under three fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey EPC contracts. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \nThe project will sell power under 20-year power purchase agreements with Vietnam Electricity.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nEach borrower has signed O&M contracts with reputable contractors. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \nThe borrowers will report to ADB on key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators, and submit (i) semiannual unaudited and annual audited financial statements, (ii) \nsemiannual environmental and social monitoring reports, and (iii) annual development \neffectiveness reports. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  EPC  =  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance; PCC1 = Power Construction Joint Stock Company No. 1; Renova = Renova, Inc. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Power Construction Joint Stock Company No. 1. \n \nF. \n \n23. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance will have two components: (i) a direct senior secured loan (A \n24. \nloan) of up to $36,000,000, and (ii) a B loan of up to $120,000,000 to be funded by commercial \nbanks.  The  A  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n \n25. \nFinancing beyond what is available in the markets. Local lenders are unable to provide \nlong-term US dollar financing, which is required to mitigate the currency mismatch risk given the \nUS  dollar-denominated  FIT.  International  lenders  are  reluctant  to  offer  non-recourse  project \nfinance loans because of concerns around the bankability of the PPA and the nascent nature of \nthe  renewable  energy  sector.  ADB  adds  value  by  (i)  developing  a  limited-recourse  financing \nstructure that addresses key PPA risks to attract international lenders, and (ii) mobilizing a debt \npackage that meets the currency and tenor requirements of project developers to promote private \nsector participation in renewable energy development in Viet Nam. \n \n\n24 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nResource mobilization and catalytic impact. ADB as the MLA will catalyze financing \n26. \nfrom international commercial banks and other development finance institutions, at a cofinancing \nratio of $3.78 for every $1.00 of ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s participation is critical for mobilization, as \nADB is one of the few financial institutions with extensive experience in large-scale renewable \nenergy projects in Viet Nam, and thus serves as a trusted reference for the market. As one of the \nfirst  and  largest  international  limited-recourse  project  finance  transactions  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  wind \npower development, the project will demonstrate a replicable model for private sector investments \ninto wind power projects in the country, and further catalyze private sector funding in the future. \n \n27. \nEnhanced  standards  and  capacity  building.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  will  ensure  that  the \nproject is developed, constructed, and operated to international good practice standards; and will \nstrengthen the environmental, social, and gender standards of PCC1 and the borrowers. \n \nC. \n \n28. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nADB has categorized the investment in compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) (SPS) as category B on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.25 \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social (E&S) \nimpacts of the project. The safeguard and social reports and plans identified measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts as well as benefit Van Kieu ethnic \nminorities. The environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment \nof PCC1 to manage the project\u2019s E&S impacts according to ADB\u2019s SPS requirements are deemed \nadequate. PCC1 commits to implement the E&S management plans, social safeguard plans, and \ncorrective actions plans for all three wind farms. \n \n30. \nEnvironment.  The  borrowers\u2019  E&S  consultant  has  prepared  initial  E&S  examination \nreports and an environmental compliance audit of existing construction activities for  each wind \nfarm.  The  project\u2019s  transmission  line  is  not  considered  an  associated  facility  under  the  SPS \ndefinition as this will be shared with neighboring wind farms. The initial E&S examination (IESE) \nreports  identified  construction  impacts  to  include  (i)  disturbance  of  terrestrial  ecology;  (ii) \ngeneration of dust, emissions, noise, and wastes; (iii) impacts on soil erosion and water quality; \nand (iv) occupational and community health and safety risks. The Phong Nguyen and Phong Huy \nwind  farms  are  in  a  protection  area  managed  by  the  Dakrong  Huong  Hoa  Protection  Forest \nManagement Board and classified as plantation forests. The E&S consultant undertook a critical \nhabitat  assessment  and  assessed  all  three  wind  farms  as  modified  habitats.  Key  operational \nimpacts include (i) shadow flicker, (ii) noise, and (iii) bird and bat collision risks. Modeling results \nindicated  that  the  Lien  Lap  wind  farm  will  generate  shadow  flicker  exceeding  the  World  Bank \nGroup\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Wind Energy, affecting five households. \nAffected households will retain the option to relocate should their decisions change during project \noperations. The avifauna survey results indicated that none of the recorded species flying within \nthe  rotor  sweep  zone  of  the  turbines  are  listed  as  globally  or  nationally  threatened  in  the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species or Viet Nam\u2019s \nRed Data Book, and that the project area does not support significant concentration of migratory \n\n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nbirds. Impacts during construction and operation will be addressed through implementation of the \nE&S  management  plans  and specific  sub-plans. Periodic  monitoring  of  physical  and biological \nimpacts and stakeholder consultations will be carried out by the borrowers. Adaptive management \nshall  be  employed  when  unforeseen  terrestrial  ecological  risks  are  identified  as  a  result  of \ncontinuous monitoring activities. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The development of the three wind \nfarms required acquisition of production forest and agricultural lands, conversion of portions of \nmodified  protection forest,  and  purchase  and  leasing  of  land from  private  users.  The  Lien  Lap \nwind farm will affect a total of 100 households (505 persons), of which 22 households (120 people) \nlost 10% or more of their productive land, including 5 Van Kieu households. The expansion of an \nexisting village road, for use by the community and the Phong Huy and Phong Nguyen wind farms, \naffected  61  households  (302  persons),  involving  12  Van  Kieu  households  (58  persons).  No \nhouseholds experienced physical displacement. None of the economically displaced households \nin the Phong Huy wind farm lost more than 10% of their productive land. The Phong Nguyen wind \nfarm  is  located  within  the  modified  protection  forest  and  only  requires  a  change  of  land  use \npurpose.  The  audit  of  the  government-led  land  acquisition  process  and  consultations  with  the \naffected  persons  confirmed  that  the  process  (i)  was  done  in  accordance  with  statutory \nrequirements,  where  compensation  payments  and  support  meet  ADB\u2019s  SPS  requirements  on \ninvoluntary resettlement; (ii) ensured participation of the affected households in the inventory of \nlosses and detailed measurement surveys; and (iii) provided avenues for the affected households \nto submit grievances. The audit also confirmed that Phong Huy and Phong Nguyen did not restrict \nhouseholds\u2019  access  to  collect  non-timber  forest  products  even  though  portions  of  modified \nprotection forest were converted for project use. Aside from land loss, Van Kieu ethnic minority \ncommunities are expected to experience limited adverse impacts because of an influx of laborers \nas well as safety, health, and security issues during construction and operation. The project did \nnot  result  in  commercialization  of  sociocultural  and  traditional  beliefs  of  the  Van  Kieu  or  any \nnatural  resources  located  within  customary  land.  The  project  will  provide  beneficial  measures \nthrough employment opportunities and socioeconomic development. \n \n32. \nTo address the adverse impacts, share benefits, and promote opportunities to all affected \nhouseholds and Van Kieu communities,  livelihood restoration and ethnic minority development \nplans  (LREMDPs)  were  prepared  for  Lien  Lap  and  Phong  Huy  and  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) for Phong Nguyen. Meaningful consultations were conducted when \npreparing  these  plans  and  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  borrowers  will  further \n(i) complete the land acquisition for transmission line towers located outside the boundary of the \nLien  Lap  wind  farm,  following  the  principles  of  replacement  cost  and  measures  agreed  during \nconsultation  to  minimize  impacts  to  affected  households;  (ii)  formalize  measures  to  address \nimpacts on economically displaced households stated in the LREMDP; and (iii) turn over access \nroads upgraded by the project to the respective commune people\u2019s committee upon completion \nof construction. Prior to land take, an addendum to the LREMDP for Lien Lap will be prepared for \nthe  additional  households  affected  by  the  15  transmission  line  towers  outside  the  project \nboundary. The borrowers will prepare semi-annual E&S monitoring reports, and the lenders\u2019 E&S \nadvisor will conduct monitoring, mid-program, and post-evaluation audits.  \n \n33. \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming.  Only  17%  of  PCC1  and  its  subsidiaries\u2019  staff  are \nfemale with few women in management (21% female), technical (9% female), and field roles (4% \nfemale).  PCC1  does  not  have  an  anti-sexual  harassment  policy.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  (1998)  and  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  plan  for  priority  2 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n(accelerating progress in gender equality),26 PCC1 has incorporated measures to promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business. Key features of the gender action plan are \nas follows: (i) targets for female workers during construction and operation; (ii) an increase in the \nproportion of female managers; (iii) development of an anti-sexual harassment policy; (iv) training \nof  staff  on  the  new  anti-sexual  harassment  policy;  and  (v)  inclusion  of  women  from  the  local \ncommunity, for the first time, in the company\u2019s training on wind power operation and management. \nPCC1 will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nThe  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \n34. \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor  standards.27 The  borrowers  will  report  semiannually  to ADB  on  (i)  its  and its  contractors\u2019 \ncompliance  with  such  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  PCC1  will  develop,  implement,  and \ncomply  with  human  resources  policies  and  procedures  and  conduct  regular  audits  on  the \nsubcontractors'  compliance  during  construction  and  operation.  The  implementation  of  the \nstakeholder  engagement  plan  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  ensure  meaningful \nengagement with affected people and will follow ADB\u2019s SPS requirements.28 \n \nB. \n \n35. \nThe borrowers and sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing international \nbest practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \nADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes appropriate provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n36. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),29 \n37. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Viet \nNam has no objection to the proposed assistance to Lien Lap, Phong Huy, and Phong Nguyen. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  (i)  the  loan  of  up  to \n$52,000,000, comprising (a) an A loan of up to $12,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nand (b) a B loan of up to $40,000,000 to Lien Lap Wind Power Joint Stock Company; (ii) the loan \nof up to $52,000,000, comprising (a) an A loan of up to $12,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and (b) a B loan of up to $40,000,000 to Phong Huy Wind Power Joint Stock Company; \n\n \n\n26 ADB.  2019.
