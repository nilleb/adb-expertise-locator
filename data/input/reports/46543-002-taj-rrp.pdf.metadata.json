To support regional cooperation and inclusive growth in the country, the project \nwill finance (i) the rehabilitation and reconstruction of approximately 175 kilometers (km) of the \nSayron\u2013Karamyk  road  section  of  CAREC  corridors  3  and  5  and  the  subnetwork  (the  Vose\u2013\nKhovaling road); (ii) the enhancement of road safety and maintenance; and (iii) local community \ndevelopment  including  improving  rural  feeder  roads  and  public  facilities,  and  training  local \ncommunities.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nTajikistan is landlocked and depends on transport corridors for investment, job creation, \ntrade, and ultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. High transport costs,  because of \nailing  transport  infrastructure  and  low  network  connectivity  coupled  with  geographic  isolation \nand  mountainous  terrain,  pose  a  significant  barrier  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.3 The  backbone  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  national  road  network,  comprising  three  CAREC \ncorridors and three Asian Highway (AH) routes, has been largely improved with assistance from \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners.4 The  improved  network \nenables  Tajikistan  to  serve  as  an  important  transit  route  in  Central  Asia.  With  continued \ntransport  and  trade  facilitation  support  from  ADB5 and  other  development  partners,  and  the \nplanned  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Tajikistan  railway  construction  that  will  connect  southern \nTajikistan with Turkmenistan through planned Afghanistan railway network, the synergistic effect \nwill  offer  new  opportunities  to  intensify  regional  cooperation  and  trade,  particularly  with \nTajikistan\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization on 2 March 2013.  \n  \nThe overlapping portion of CAREC corridors 3 and 5\u2014from the capital Dushanbe to the \n4. \nKaramyk  border  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2014is  a  largely  two-lane  highway  of  about  340  km. \nAround 160 km of the road passes along deep riverbanks and is difficult to widen because it is \nconstrained  by  mountainous  topography.  Because  of  the  government\u2019s  limited  budget  for \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2013.  Technical \n\nAssistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the CAREC Corridors 3 and 5 Enhancement Project. Manila. \n\n3  For example, the domestic freight rate between Dushanbe and Khujand (approximately 300 km apart) exceeds that \nbetween Moldova and the United States, according to the World Bank\u2019s latest Country Economic Memorandum on \nTajikistan  (Report  No.  54677-TJ)  released  in  2011.  The  cost  to  export  (US$  per  container)  that  includes  inland \ntransport is 8,450 in Tajikistan, around four times of those in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as per the  World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business 2013 data for Tajikistan. \n\n4  CAREC corridor 3 (concurrently AH65) runs east\u2013west from the border with Uzbekistan through Dushanbe to  the \nborder  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  CAREC  corridor  6  (concurrently  AH7)  runs  north\u2013south  from  the  border  with \nUzbekistan through Dushanbe to the border with Afghanistan; CAREC corridor 5 overlaps with corridor 3 from the \nborder  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  up  to  Dushanbe,  and  with  corridor  6  from  Dushanbe  to  the  border  with \nAfghanistan; AH66 starts at Dushanbe and passes through Vakhdat, Dangara, Vose, Kulob, Khorug, and Murgob \nbefore reaching the Kulma Pass (to the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n\n5  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grants to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Regional \nImprovement of Border Services Project. Manila. \n\n\fthe  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road,  with \n\nimproving a longer section of road at the time the project was designed in 2006 and the limited \ntraffic forecasted  at the  time,  the  design for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk  section adopted  one  asphalt \nconcrete  layer.6 Additionally,  other  rehabilitation  work  such  as  rock  excavation,  drainage,  and \nconcrete retaining walls was reduced in quantity because of a lack of funds. The rehabilitation of \nthe section was completed in August 2011. The traffic has since then surged in both volume and \naxle  loading,  degrading  the  pavement  condition  faster  than  initially  anticipated.7 There  is  an \nimminent need to enhance the Sayron\u2013Karamyk section to extend road service life, and improve \nroad safety and maintenance for better serviceability. Moreover, because the traffic capacity on \nCAREC  corridors  3  and  5  is  likely  to  be  realized  earlier  than  expected,  the  connectivity  and \ncapacity of the subnetwork will need improving.8  \n \n5. \nThe  Vose\u2013Khovaling\u2013Tavildara  road  extends  the  first  ADB-assisted  road  in  Tajikistan, \nstarting  at  AH66  and  connecting  through  the  Darband\u2013Tavildara\u2013Kalaikhumb  road  to  CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5. This road was categorized as a republican (national) road during the Soviet \nera  but  has  seriously  deteriorated  because  of  prolonged  inadequate  maintenance  and  recent \nflood damage, causing transport difficulty and safety concerns. The government has prioritized \nfollow. \nrehabilitating \nImprovements to this stretch of road will (i) cut travel time almost in half from the Kyrgyz border \nto Khatlon; (ii) open a new trade corridor in the most populous region in Tajikistan; (iii) provide \neasier  access  to  southern  markets;  and  (iv)  enhance  economic  connections  with  CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5, AH66, and Afghanistan and beyond.9  \n  \n6. \nProgress  has  been  made  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  transport \nsector including (i) developing the Transport Sector Master Plan,10 (ii) restructuring the Ministry \nof  Transport  (MOT),  (iii)  strengthening  maintenance,  and  (iv)  building  procurement  capacity \nthrough introducing competitive bidding. While more sector activities including developing a road \ncondition  database  and  strengthening  vehicle  overloading  controls  are  under  way,  substantial \ngaps  remain.  The  core  problems  are  poor  road  connectivity  and  serviceability,  deteriorating \ninfrastructure  network,  deficient  asset  management,  limited  private  sector  involvement,  and \nlimited  institutional  capacity.  Poor  connectivity  and  high  transport  costs  have  caused \nconstrained  economic  and  social  development.  Under  the  project,  ADB  will  help  improve  the \nconnectivity and strengthen institutional capacity in road safety and maintenance. \n \n7. \nThe  improvement  of  the  regional  and  national  transportation  network  remains  the \ngovernment\u2019s top priority, as stressed in its Living Standards Improvement Strategy of Tajikistan \n\nthe  Khovaling\u2013Tavildara  road \n\nto \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement \nProject.  Manila.  The  project  will  be  closed  in  September  2013  upon  completion  of  the  ongoing  institutional \nstrengthening component.   \n\n7  Traffic  on  CAREC  corridors  3  and  5  grew  at  about  15%  per  year  in  2005\u20132012.  International  traffic  passing  the \nKaramyk  border  increased  from  about  10  trucks  per  day  in  2006  to  around  100  trucks  per  day  in  2012.  The \naverage daily traffic on the corridor in 2012 reached 2,000 vehicles comprising over 50% trucks.  \n\n8  For example, the rehabilitation of the Kurgonteppa\u2013Dangara road is  nearly finished; the extensional  rehabilitation \nwork  for  the  Dangara\u2013Khovaling  road  is  ongoing.  The  improvement  of  the  Darband\u2013Tavildara\u2013Kalaikhumb  road \nthat  links  CAREC  corridors  3  and  5  to  AH66  is  planned  for  2014,  the  project  feasibility  study  of  which  is  near \ncompletion. Sections of AH66 between Kulob and Murgob are being rehabilitated or planned for improvement in 3\u2013\n5 years. \n\n9  The  road  will  alleviate  future  traffic  pressure  to  the  national  capital  by  providing  a  new  conduit  for  southbound \ntraffic.  Multimodal  goods  transport  at  Vose  rail  station  was  functioning  efficiently  before  the  Tajik  rail  line  got \ndisconnected  from  the  Uzbekistan  rail  network. With  the  extension  of  southern  Tajik  rail  line  to  connect  with  the \nplanned Afghanistan rail network, goods can again be efficiently transported through AH66 and CAREC corridors 5 \nand 6 or through the planned rail network.  \n\n10 ADB. 2011.

The  project  is  part \nof  the  country\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Development  Program  up  to  2025  and  is  included  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s 2014\u20132016 Public Investment Program. It also fits well with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nin two core operational areas (infrastructure, and regional cooperation and integration) and is in \nline with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014.11   \n \n8. \nADB  assistance  to  Tajikistan\u2019s  transport  sector  has  been  successful.  The  government \nand  development  partners  recognize  transport  as  one  of  ADB\u2019s  main  areas  of  expertise.  The \nproject  design  incorporates  key  lessons  learned  from  past  experience  including  (i)  obtaining \ngovernment assurances on project sustainability, (ii) expanding the project\u2019s social development \nbenefits  for  more  inclusive  development,  and  (iii)  using  advance  contracting  to  avoid \nimplementation delays. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact of the project will be enhanced regional economic cooperation and inclusive \neconomic  growth  in  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  regional  network  (CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5 and the subnetwork) connectivity. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  improved  road  conditions  and  enhanced  road  safety  on \nCAREC corridors 3 and 5 (the Sayron\u2013Karamyk road section, 88 km) and the subnetwork (the \nVose\u2013Khovaling  road,  87  km)  totaling  175  km;  (ii)  extended  access  to  local  communities \nthrough  the  improvement  of  rural  feeder  roads;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of  project \nmanagement, contract supervision, and efficient road maintenance.  \n \n11. \nImproved  road  condition  and  enhanced  road  safety.  The  scope  of  rehabilitation \nand/or  reconstruction  work  for  the  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road  (category  IV)  includes  selective \nwidening  at  substandard  sections;  the  easing  of  vertical  and  horizontal  alignments  at  key \nlocations;  earthworks;  pavement  milling  and  overlay;  the  construction  and/or  rehabilitation  of \nbridges, culverts, and drains; and roadside improvements and safety engineering features such \nas  traffic  signs,  road  markings,  traffic  barriers,  sidewalks,  road  lighting,  and  slope  protection \nmeasures.  The  scope  of  road  enhancement  work  on  the  Sayron\u2013Karamyk  road  section \n(category IV) includes remedial works of the base and/or subgrade layers in weak subsections; \npavement  overlay;  the  installation  of  improved  drains  in  problematic  areas;  slope  stabilization \nworks in areas with regular rock fall risks; and road safety improvements including traffic signs, \nroad markings,  traffic  barriers,  road  lighting,  and  slope protection  measures. The  existing  road \ncategory will be maintained and level of service improved for both road sections.12  \n \nExtended  access  to  local  communities.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  social \n12. \ndevelopment of local communities by improving about 30 km of village feeder roads in the Vose \nand  Khovaling  districts,  constructing  roadside  rest  areas  for  male  and  female  vendors  and \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2008.

It  has  implemented  six  ADB-assisted  road  projects \nsince 1998. Its project implementation unit (PIU) staff has the necessary experience and skills, \nand will be assisted by the technical departments of MOT and project management consultants \nduring project implementation.  \n \n17. \nAn international firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  to  (i)  help  the  PIU  supervise  project \nimplementation,  (ii)  provide  hands-on  training  in  project  management  and  reporting,  and \n(iii) improve  institutional  capacity  in  road  safety  management  and  promote  community  road \nsafety  awareness.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  ADB  grant  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  and/or  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s prior review.  \n \n18. \nAdvance  actions  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  consulting  guidelines  have  been \ntaken  to  expedite  pre-construction  works  and  avoid  initial  implementation  delays.

Inadequate  maintenance \nand  natural  disasters  have  led  to  rapid  road  deterioration  and  necessitate  improvement  to \nensure the  safe  and  efficient movement  of  people  and goods. The  design  and  implementation \nmodalities  were  selected  in  consideration  of  the  technical  viability,  traffic  safety,  and  road \nsustainability. For example, the road design allows flexibility for locations constrained by terrain \nand  right-of-way,  maximizes \nlocal  construction  materials,  and  minimizes \nenvironmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Climate  resilience  measures  such  as  soil \nbioengineering for slope stabilization, solar energy installations for road safety, and special river \nbank  protection  for  flood-prone  road  sections  have  been  integrated  in  the  road  rehabilitation \nplan. Performance-based road maintenance will also be adopted to improve road service quality \nand prolong service life. \n \n20. \nRoad  safety  audits,  and  safety-related  training  and  community  awareness  education \nprograms  will  be  conducted  before  the  road  safety  improvements  are  carried  out.  A  review  of \nroad  safety  will  continue  throughout  implementation,  including  a  post-construction  audit  to \ncorrect any potential deficiencies. Safety improvement measures, primarily simple and low-cost \nsolutions,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  to  mitigate  safety  concerns  as  a  result  of  the \npotential  increase  in  traffic  speed  and  volume  after  road  rehabilitation.  Road  safety  will  be \nsubstantially  improved  with  the  provision  of  traffic  signs,  line  markings,  marked  pedestrian \ncrossings protected by speed control devices, and slope stabilization measures in mountainous \nsections  where  soil  erosion,  rock  and  debris  flow,  and  slope  failure  often  obstruct  traffic \nthroughout the year. Traffic calming devices and road lights will also be constructed to promote \nspeed reduction at access points and improve safety through villages along the project roads. \n  \n21. \nThe  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  operations  will  be  increased  by \n(i) maximizing the use of local construction materials, (ii) applying weighbridges to reduce undue \nroad  damage  from  vehicle  overloading,  and  (iii)  introducing  a  performance-based  mechanism \nfor  contracting  road  maintenance  to  private  sectors.  The  design  solutions  and  performance-\nbased maintenance will  benefit local road agencies whose maintenance operations have been \nhampered  by  a  lack  of  equipment  and  skilled  labor  force,  and  a  high  volume  of  maintenance \nwork. With  the  expected  institutional  improvements,  MOT\u2019s  road maintenance  program  will  be \nstrengthened and relevant local road agencies and/or organizations will develop the necessary \ncapacity for sustainable road maintenance. \n \n22. \nThe  minor  upgrading  to  an  all-weather  surface  of  about  30  km  of  road  that  connects \nvillage  feeder  roads  in  the  Vose  and  Khovaling  districts  will  further  improve  access  to  basic \nsocial services such as schools, hospitals, and local markets. These roads will be selected from \nthe  list  approved  by  MOT  and  local  governments  based  on  (i)  geographic  location,  (ii) \nsafeguards  consideration,  (iii) social  and  economic  aspects,  and  (iv)  opportunities \nfor \ncooperation  with  other  poverty  alleviation  projects  in  the  area.  Consultations  with  local \ngovernments and residents of rural villages will be conducted in identifying roads for repair. The \nlocal  governments  will  be  responsible  for  the  continued  maintenance  following  the  road \nimprovement. \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n23. \nThe economic analysis compared with-project and without-project scenarios. The project \neconomic  benefits  include  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  (ii)  travel  time  savings, \n(iii) generated  traffic,  and  (iv)  road  safety  benefits.  The  project  is  economically  viable,  with  a \nconsolidated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 23.2% (28.9% for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk \nroad  section  and  15.9%  for  the  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road).  The  sensitivity  analysis  pertaining  to \ncapital investment and economic and traffic growth was conducted to assess the robustness of \nthe  results  of  the  economic  analysis.  The  results  show  the  project  will  maintain  its  economic \nviability  under  unfavorable  scenarios.  A  quantitative  risk  analysis  has  also  been  carried  out  to \nreinforce the economic appraisal results, with two key variables relating to construction cost and \neconomic  growth  incorporated.  Risk  analysis  results  show  that  the  minimum  risk-based  EIRR \npredicted for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk road section is 23.1%, with a 95% probability that the EIRR \nwill  be  above  24.6%;  and  14.4%  for  the  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road,  with  a  95%  probability  that  the \nEIRR will be above 15.1%.  \n \nThe  project  financial  sustainability  is  deemed  strong  because  (i)  funding  for  the  main \n24. \nworks comes directly from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund grant, with the government providing \ncounterpart  funding  mainly  for  taxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  and \ncontingencies.  As  such,  issues  regarding  government  funding  shortage  will  have  negligible \nfinancial impact on the project; (ii) the project aligns well with other development activities such \nas  rural  growth,  disaster  mitigation,  and  education  from  other  development  partners  including \nthe  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  German  development  cooperation \nthrough  KfW,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  World  Food  Programme;  and  (iii)  the \ngovernment  is  committed  to  provide  funds  to  complete  any  required  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  government  has  increased  the  road  maintenance  budget  continuously, \ndespite  fiscal  constraints.  State  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  increased  from \nTJS13.5 million ($4.4 million equivalent) in 2004 to TJS52.7 million ($11.1 million equivalent) in \n2013. While this is still less than half of the nationwide maintenance needs, this budget outlay \nwill  continue  to  increase  by  about  15%  per  year  during  2013\u20132017,  and  road  maintenance \ncontinues to be prioritized by road importance.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  assessments  of  MOT\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management  capacity,  among \nother  governance-related  aspects,  confirmed  that  its  PIU  has  sufficient  capacity  to  manage \ninternational  and  national  procurement  and  has  no  major  financial  management  deficiencies. \nThe  unit\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  are  adequate  and  in  line  with  national  and  international \nlegislation  and  ADB  requirements.  The  PIU  is  capable  of  making  timely  payments,  correctly \nrecording  all  transactions  and  balances,  supporting  the  preparation  of  regular  and  reliable \nfinancial  statements,  and  safeguarding  its  assets.  Further  improvement  areas  include  more \ntransparent  operations  such  as  inviting  civil  society  organizations  to  observe  public  biddings, \nstreamlining the PIU business processes with more quality control measures, regularly updating \noperational  tools,  and  providing  necessary  training  for  finance,  accounting,  and  procurement \nstaff. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \n \n\nGovernance  \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n27. \nIn  consultation  with  communities  on  and  near  project  roads,  strong  enthusiasm  was \nexpressed  for  the  planned  road  improvement.  The  long  travel  time  to  markets  and  limited \nelectricity  supply  for  food  processing  activities  relegates  women  to  the  lower  end  of  the \nagricultural  production  value  chain.  Increased  connectivity  will  benefit  women  and  men  in \naccess to social services and trade. The project will significantly benefit them by reducing travel \ntime  to  reach  social  services  and  markets.  Moreover,  by  improving  transport  in  the  area,  the \nproject  will  help  other  poverty  alleviation  projects  from  development  partners  realize  their  full \npotential. \n \n28. \nMany  local  men  of  working  age  are  away  working  overseas,  so the  women  left  behind \nhave to earn cash for daily expenses in addition to their responsibilities for the household and \ncaring for the sick and elderly. To expand benefits for women, the project will finance roadside \npublic  facilities for  women\u2019s  improved  comfort  and  income  generation,  street  lighting  and  road \nsafety measures, and feeder roads for improved access to poor villages not located on the main \nroad.  Women  will  gain  a  share  of  project-related  jobs  (including  those  in  construction  and \nmaintenance),  take  advantage  of  rest  areas  and  stopping  points  along  the  road  to  sell  goods \nand services, and profit from increased tourism, e.g., to the shrine, the Vose museum, and the \nresort  (all  located  in  Khovaling).  Training  will  be  provided  to  improve  livelihoods  and  develop \nentrepreneurship,  raise  road  safety  awareness,  combat  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  and \nimprove gender awareness in local communities. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n29. \nTajikistan  depends  on  hydropower  to  solve  its  energy  needs,  but  in  rural  areas\u2014\nparticularly during winter when glacial melt is at its lowest and energy demand at the highest\u2014\nenergy  cuts,  including  for  traffic  lights,  restrict  the  movement  of  people  and  goods,  and  harm \neconomic  activities.  With  abundant  solar  energy  resource  in  project  areas,  the  project  will \nenhance  road  safety  by  introducing  photovoltaic  solar  applications  to  power  street  lights  and \npublic  facilities  along  the  road  corridor.  The  project  will  also  demonstrate  photovoltaic  solar \nsolutions  in  three  off-grid  villages  on  or  near  project  roads  to  help  mitigate  greenhouse  gas \nemissions  by  replacing  the  use  of  fossil-intensive  fuels  (e.g.,  kerosene  and  diesel)  for  lighting \nand  diesel  generators  for  power  supply.  This  will  contribute  to  improved  living  standards  by \nhaving efficient and environment friendly illumination, increased and better trading opportunities, \naccess to electronic media, and more time to study for children.  \n \nE. \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project  does  not  pass \nthrough  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  will  not  result  in  significant  negative \nenvironmental  impacts.  MOT  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  according  to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national legislation and regulations. The IEE was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 19 June 2013. The project will have temporary and reversible \nenvironmental impacts during implementation. Project-affected people were consulted. The IEE \nincludes  an  environmental  management  plan  to minimize  the  project\u2019s  potential  environmental \nimpacts.  The  environmental  management  capacity  of  MOT  will  be  strengthened  by  a  new \nenvironmental and social officer position in the PIU. MOT, assisted by an international firm, will \nbe responsible for implementing the plan and submitting semiannual monitoring reports to ADB.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). In the \n31. \nVose\u2013Khovaling road section, the impacts are mostly minor such as the impact on fences and \nwall  structures  except  for  four  households  and  business  entities  that  will  likely  be  adversely \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nimpacted;  while  in  the  Sayron\u2013Karamyk  road  section,  land  acquisition  impact  is  not  expected. \nMOT prepared a resettlement plan according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nnational legislation and regulations to mitigate the impacts and assigned a dedicated staff with \nresources  to  carry  out  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activity  of  the  project.  The \nresettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  affected  persons  through  public  consultations,  and  on  the \nADB  website  on  21  June  2013.  MOT  will  submit  an  updated  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  if  any \nchanges are made during implementation, following the finalization of the detailed design.  \n \nF. \n \n32. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The integrated project benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the project costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nInadequate road \nmaintenance \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe government covenants to increase annual road maintenance budget from \nTJS3,000/kilometer in 2013 to TJS7,000/kilometer in 2017, or increase at the same \nrate as increases of the national budgets during 2014\u20132017, whichever is higher.  \n\nUnder the project, vehicle overloading control measures will be implemented to \nreduce undue road damage. Performance-based road maintenance for project \nroads will be contracted out to private sectors following project completion, which \nshould ensure good levels of maintenance.   \n\nThe Ministry of Transport, assisted by implementation consultants, is gaining \nexperience from a similar community development component under another Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) road project approved in September 2012.  \n\nFor the solar energy installations, consulting services (including technical support \nand capacity development) will be recruited through the research and development \ntechnical assistance for Effective Deployment of Distributed Small Wind Power \nSystems in Asian Rural Areas to provide extensive training to the project \nimplementation unit and local communities on related installation, repair, and \nmaintenance.a Additionally, operation and maintenance contract of 2\u20133 years will be \nprocured from the supplier or separate service provider. \n\nThe government's allocation of adequate funds and resources for implementation of \nthe resettlement plan is covenanted in the grant agreement.  \n\nADB will field safeguards review missions from time to time in addition to regular \nproject implementation reviews.
