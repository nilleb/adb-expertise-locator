The report also describes the proposed administration of \na  loan  of  up  to  $25,000,000  to  be  provided  by  the  Leading  Asia\u2019s  Private  Infrastructure  Fund \n(LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2. \nThe loan, to be guaranteed by Fiji, will cover Fiji Airways\u2019 fixed costs during the operational \nshutdown, and the working capital requirements for a 2021 ramp-up and restoration of its flight \nservices. Since March 2020, the flight operations of Fiji Airways have been severely interrupted \nby  global  travel  restrictions  because  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  The \nproject  supports  Fiji  Airways\u2019  effort  to  sustain  its  business  through  this  crisis  and  return  to \nprofitable operations. Fiji Airways is the South Pacific\u2019s leading airline with a strong safety record, \na new aircraft fleet, and a history of profitable operations. It provides essential transport for Fiji \nand other small island developing states in the South Pacific, and is a foundation for economic \nand social development in the region. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Fiji Airways, Fiji\u2019s national flag carrier airline, is the Pacific\u2019s largest \nregional airline, accounting for 65% of international seat capacity to Fiji and 60% of interregional \nseat  capacity,  connecting  the  South  Pacific  to  Australia,  New  Zealand,  the  United  States,  and \nAsia.  It  provides  the  majority  of  international  seat  capacity  to  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu  (fragile  and \nconflict-affected situation countries), a substantial proportion of capacity to Samoa, Tonga, and \nVanuatu, as well as most domestic flights connecting the Fijian islands. It also provides access to \nbasic  commodities  and  social  services  by  importing  essential  goods  and  allowing  the  local \npopulation  to  connect  to  other  parts  of  the  world.  It  is  therefore  a  fundamental  transport \ninfrastructure for the Fijian and regional economies, which depend on tourism and exports. \n \n4. \nFiji  Airways  contributes to regional  coordination and integration.  Because Fiji  is  a  large \nand  important  Pacific  regional  distribution  center,  the  carrier  facilitates  regional  emergency \nresponse  and  recovery efforts,  including  recovery from  periodic  regional cyclones.  Fiji  Airways \nalso plays a critical role in providing access to Fiji\u2019s health care facilities for people from other \nPacific countries, notably Kiribati and Tuvalu, and to tertiary care outside the region, particularly \nin Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. \n \nPrior to the pandemic, Fiji Airways had experienced strong passenger and revenue growth \n5. \nand was profitable for 8 years through 2019. The airline has a new aircraft fleet and a strong safety \nrecord, with no aircraft accidents resulting in aircraft losses or passenger fatalities.2 \n \nImpact of COVID-19. The unprecedented global crisis caused by COVID-19 has crippled \n6. \nthe aviation and tourism industries. Travel restrictions imposed by governments worldwide to halt \nthe  rapid  spread  of  the  disease,  coupled  with  consumer  reluctance  to  travel,  have  crushed \ninternational travel demand, resulting in most airlines grounding most of their aircraft. \n\n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  As defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Annex 13. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nProject design.  \n\n \n7. \nFiji  Airways  has  been  affected  by  COVID-19  since  the  beginning  of  2020,  starting  with \nweak demand in Asian markets; extending to core markets in Australia, New Zealand, and the \nUnited  States;  and  culminating  in the  government-imposed  shutdown  on 22  March  2020  of  all \nregularly  scheduled  Fijian  international  and  domestic  flights.  As  a  consequence,  Fiji  Airways \nsuspended  international  and  regional  passenger  flights  until  the  end  of  December  2020.  The \nbiggest  question  now  is  how  long  the  COVID-19  impact  will  last  and  whether  the  airline  has \nenough  cash  reserves  to  tide  it  through.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  was  requested  to  provide  liquidity  support  to  Fiji  Airways  to  meet  its  operational  cash \nrequirements until normal flight operations can resume. \n \n8. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9. \nFiji Airways resumed domestic flights in April 2020 and is now flying regularly scheduled \ndomestic  flights  at  50%  normal  capacity.  It  also  instituted  regular  international  cargo  service \nflights, including current weekly operations to Sydney; Auckland; Los Angeles; Hong Kong, China; \nand Singapore. Its cargo services assure continued supply of medical and other critical imports \nto the South Pacific as well as exports of fresh produce, seafood, and garments. It has started to \nrehire  cabin  crew  to  train  and  prepare  for  a  resumption  of  international  flights.  Fiji  Airways \ncoordinated recovery and logistics planning with the Government of Fiji, Airports Fiji, and Fijian \nhotels. They all are completing preparations for a return to international service at an appropriate \ntime between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 with a \u201cTravel Ready\u201d \nprogram  targeted  at  New  Zealand  and  Australia  that  includes  pre-departure  health  screening, \nonline check-in, \u201cwellness\u201d staff on each flight, adapted in-flight procedures, \u201ccorridor\u201d customs \nprocessing and transport in Fiji, dedicated Fijian resort packages by nationality, and a marketing \ncampaign. This effort included work with ADB on coordinating COVID-19 recovery programs and \nassistance, including technical assistance to Fiji Airports in airport planning and aviation security.3 \n \n10. \nBorrower. Fiji Airways is predominantly a passenger airline (passengers accounted for \n83% of revenues in 2019), and its strategy is to be the leading airline connecting the South Pacific, \nwhere it served 19 direct destinations before the outbreak of COVID-19.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nIts  business model  is to  provide  a  quality  and  reliable Pacific  regional  air  service  based  on  its \nmodern, fuel-efficient fleet, which includes A350s and Boeing 737 MAX 8s. As stated before (para. \n5), it has a strong safety record with no aircraft accidents resulting in passenger deaths or aircraft \nhull losses. \n \n11. \nFollowing the appointment of a new chief executive officer in 2015, Fiji Airways embarked \non a program of quality service, fleet renewal, and network expansion, boosting passengers by \n27% over 5 years, to 1.7 million in 2019, and opening up new direct weekly routes connecting the \nPacific to North America (San Francisco), Australia (Adelaide), and Asia (Singapore and Tokyo). \nIn December 2018, Fiji Airways became a OneWorld connect partner and in mid-2019 attained \nthe Skytrax 4-Star quality rating.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n3  ADB. Regional: Pacific Economic Management (Phase 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence. 4  Fiji  Airways,  its  shareholders,  and  its \n12. \nmanagement  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a  significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity  risk  as \nthere are no unresolved adverse media or relevant information related to them. ADB\u2019s review of \nFiji  Airways  does  not  give  ADB  cause  to  believe  that  it  is  being  used  for  money  laundering, \nterrorism  financing,  tax secrecy,  tax  evasion,  or  tax fraud.  Tax  integrity  due  diligence  was  not \nrequired. \n \n13. \nGuarantor. The project will benefit from a sovereign guarantee provided by Fiji covering \nthe total principal amount of the ADB loan; it was approved by the Parliament of Fiji on 26 May \n2020. This gives significant support to the project, since the borrower\u2019s revenue-generating ability \nwas severely curtailed and remains uncertain because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. \n \nFiji is one of the most developed economies in the Pacific, and tourism has been the main \n14. \ndriver  of  economic  activity  and  foreign  direct  investment,  contributing  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) per capita of $6,141 in 2019. The economy is projected to contract by 19.8% in 20205 and \nto grow by 1.0% in 2021 under COVID-19 (based on a gradual revival of international travel from \nthe  second  quarter  of  2021).  Tax  cuts  to  boost  economic  activity  and  tourism,  reduced \ngovernment revenue as the economy contracts, and increased spending to counter COVID-19 \nimpacts are projected to widen the fiscal deficit to 20.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2021 (FY2019: \n\u20133.6%, FY2020: \u20138.2%). Public debt as a ratio of GDP was 49.3% at the end of FY2019 and is \nprojected to reach 65.6% of GDP in FY2020, and 83.4% of GDP in FY2021. To mitigate this, Fiji \nis  increasing  its  engagement  with  development  partners,  led  by  ADB,  to  access  lower-cost \nfinancing accompanied by technical assistance. It is also working closely with the International \nMonetary  Fund,  which  carries  out  regular  country  surveillance  and  continues  to  assess  Fiji\u2019s \npublic debt as being sustainable.6 \n \nB. \n \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Fiji\u2019s  status  as  a  vibrant  and \n15. \nmodern regional and international hub for people and cargo movement enhanced, as suggested \nby the 5-year and 20-year National Development Plan.7 \n \n16. \ntransport movements of passenger and goods restored and sustained.8 \n \n17. \nOutputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) Fiji Airways\u2019 liquidity crisis caused \nby  COVID-19  avoided,  (ii)  workers\u2019  livelihood  secured  and  gender  equality  enhanced,  and \n(iii) gender equality of the work environment enhanced. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  because  it  fosters  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  By  supporting  Fiji \nAirways, a core transport pillar in the South Pacific, ADB will help preserve connectivity and access \n\nOutcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  international  and  domestic  air \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs   \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n\nTerrorism.

The project also promotes private \nsector-led growth in Fiji and, through the gender measures captured in the agreed gender action \nplan, gender equality. It is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project mobilizes \nan ADB interdepartmental team to integrate well-established knowledge and contacts in Fiji with \na private sector financial structure. \n \n19. \nThe project complements PARD\u2019s long-term, close relationship with the Government of \nFiji  as  its  leading  multilateral  partner.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Fiji \nhighlights  the  importance  of  promoting  private  sector  investment  and  growth,  including  by \npromoting  domestic  and  regional  connectivity  through  transport  infrastructure,  and  specifically \nhighlighting the need for enterprises that are partly or fully owned by the state to access finance \non commercial terms where feasible, including through potential ADB nonsovereign operations. \nThe  transaction also complements the  $200 million  policy-based  loan for  subprogram  3 of  the \nSustained Private Sector-Led Growth Reform Program, which was approved by the ADB Board \nof Directors in July 2020, and is built on reforms to improve fiscal management, the performance \nof state-owned enterprises, and the business and investment climate. \n \n20. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, through which ADB intends to substantially expand \nthe scale, influence, and effectiveness of its support for regional cooperation.9 The initiative also \nemphasizes private sector participation as an integral part of mainstreaming sustainable transport \nin ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n \n21. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign \nfinancing in Fiji, and its first to an airline. The project benefits from PARD\u2019s leading experience in \nFiji as well as ADB\u2019s experience in structuring and implementing air transport infrastructure such \nas the Mactan Cebu International Passenger Terminal Project (Philippines). \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22. \nState-owned enterprises. Since 2012, Fiji Airways has developed into a successful, well-\nmanaged, and partially privatized company with an established history of profitable operations, \nindependently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It has demonstrated its ability to compete on \nan  equal  footing  and  without  subsidy  against  leading  international  airlines  such  as  Air  New \nZealand,  Qantas,  and  Virgin  Australia,  serving  as  an  example  in  the  Pacific  region  for  a  well-\nmanaged  state-owned  enterprise.  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  reflecting  government  and  international \nsupport to the global air industry during this COVID-19 crisis, will help prepare Fiji Airways\u2019 return \nto profitable operations  in the  post-pandemic  global  economy.  Fiji  Airways  already reflects the \nreforms that Fiji is promulgating with regard to its state-owned enterprise sector. \n \nD. \n \n23. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n \nE. \n \n24. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.10 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProject scope. \n\n \n9  ADB. 2010.

These are reflected in Fiji\u2019s \nCivil Aviation Acts (1977), which are administered by Fiji\u2019s Department of Civil \nAviation under the Office of the Solicitor-General. The department is \nresponsible for managing bilateral and multilateral air services agreements. It \nalso oversees the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, which is responsible for the \ntechnical regulation of aviation in Fiji. Fiji Airways is subject to regulation by the \nFijian Competition and Consumer Commission for consumer ticket pricing. As a \nmember IATA, Fiji Airways is bound to the IATA Operational Safety Audit \nProgram. Fiji Airways has code-sharing arrangements with 14 other airlines, \nwhich also require reciprocal independent audits. \nFiji Airways is managed by an internationally experienced team of chief \nexecutive, chief operations officer, chief financial officer, and general counsel; \nand 8 executive managers. Fiji Airways promotes gender equality, recently \nreinforcing the number of women in senior management (7 out of 28). \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nAccording to the audit results conducted by IATA, all employees have received \ntraining in the safety management system principles. A healthy reporting \nculture was observed, and Fiji Airways is fully committed to the continual \nimprovement of the safety management system. \n\nIATA = International Air Transport Association, ICAO = International Civil Aviation Organization. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Fiji Airways.  \n \nF. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s assistance consists of (i) a secured corporate loan of up to $40 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and (ii) a parallel loan of up to $25 million, to be provided by LEAP and \nadministered by ADB.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n \n26. \n\nADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i) \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nIts assistance will play a key role in Fiji Airways\u2019 financing efforts, supported by the \nGovernment of Fiji, to ensure that Fiji Airways transitions through the COVID-19 \ncrisis  and  emerges  with  the  capability  to  resume  its  key  role  in  transport \ninfrastructure for Fiji and other Pacific countries. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nADB  will  contribute  to  promoting  gender  equality  at  Fiji  Airways  by  enhancing \nwomen\u2019s participation in technical and managerial roles as well as developing a \npolicy to tackle and mitigate gender-based violence. The project achieves effective \ngender mainstreaming categorization. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n(iv) \n(v)  With ADB\u2019s engagement, Fiji Airways agreed to implement a corrective action plan \nto improve the management of environmental risks in its premises, and to improve \nthe implementation of existing plans and procedures. \n\nRisks \n\n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nIn compliance with the requirements of its Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for general \ncorporate finance, ADB categorized the project as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples. 11 This  categorization  is  based  on  the  understanding  that  (i) ADB\u2019s \nproceeds  will  not  be  used  by  Fiji  Airways  to  upgrade,  purchase,  manufacture  new  or \ndecommission existing aircraft, open new routes, or acquire land; and (ii) funds will be used only \nto fill the company\u2019s liquidity gap and restore flight operations. Therefore, impacts in addition to \nthose  associated  with  normal  pre-pandemic  operations  are  not  envisaged.  Key  environmental \nimpacts  and  risks  associated  with  Fiji  Airways\u2019  operations  include  air  emissions,  noise, \noccupational and public health and safety (including the spread of COVID-19), and wastewater \nand  waste  generation  associated  with  routine  flight  operations,  and  aircraft  and  building \nmaintenance activities performed directly by the company (including refueling of ground vehicles, \nminor maintenance, and cleaning of aircrafts and hangars). \n \n28. \nADB  performed  a  risk-based  environmental  and  social  management  system  audit  and \ncorporate  audit  against  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  guidelines  of  the  World  Bank  Group  for  airlines.  Fiji \nAirways  has  a  dedicated  safety,  security,  and  quality  team  to  manage  the  EHS  aspects  of  its \noperations and systems. It has an occupational health and safety policy, an environmental policy, \nand uses the Rolls-Royce Safety Management System solution to record EHS risk assessments, \nand incidents and associated reports, and monitor performance indicators. Management systems, \nplans, and procedures follow the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, International \nAir Transport Association (IATA), and OneWorld standards. IATA performs biannual operational \nsafety  audits  of  Fiji  Airways\u2019  operations.  The  \u201cTravel  Ready\u201d  program  follows  World  Health \nOrganization  advice  along  with  recommendations  by  IATA  and  the  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO). \n \n29. \nFiji  Airways  monitors  fuel  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Fiji  Airways  has \nemissions  reduction targets  to reduce  potential  climate  change  impacts.  It  files  annual  reports \nunder IATA's FRED+ (fuel reporting and emissions database) platform, and will prepare the first \nCORSIA (carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) report in 2020 as a \nvoluntary initiative. Fiji Airways has internationally compliant standard operating procedures for \nnoise  abatement  and,  with  Airports  Fiji,  rolled  out  management  measures  to  prevent  bird \ncollisions. It also implemented plans for emergency procedures, and for handling and control of \ndangerous  goods,  or  hazardous  waste  materials.  Aircraft  disinfection  is  performed  in  line  with \nAustralian and New Zealand biosecurity procedures. \n \n\n11 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nADB\u2019s corporate audit also concluded that Fiji Airways\u2019 management system and plans \n30. \naddress the impacts and risks associated with the company\u2019s normal pre-pandemic operations. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  the  company  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n31. \nFiji Airways will observe ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list and will comply with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core \nlabor standards.12 It will report annually to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such \nlaws  and  standards,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people, if needed, will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.13 \n \n32. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Fiji has made a number of specific international and \nnational  commitments  to  gender  equality,  but  gender  inequality  remains  rooted  in  traditional \nnorms, customs, and models of decision making that are perpetuated by discriminatory practices, \nlegislative and policy biases, and unequal access to resources and services. The gender gaps in \nlabor force participation in Fiji are also significant: in 2015, most men aged 15 and above (81%) \nwere employed or actively looking for work, compared with less than half of women (46%). \n \n33. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nFiji Airways operates a company-wide anti-sexual harassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), it has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are to (i) \nincrease the number of women in technical roles; (ii) train female cadets for the first time in its \nnew Fiji Airways Aviation Academy; (iii) increase the number of women in management roles; (iv) \ndevelop and implement a gender inclusion policy to increase the proportion of women recruited, \nretained,  and  promoted,  particularly  in  technical  and  management  roles;  and  (v)  develop  and \nimplement a family violence policy. Fiji Airways will submit periodic reports on its implementation \nof gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nFiji  Airways  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe project will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign transaction in Fiji and the first in the airline \nindustry.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n12 ADB. 2003.
