THE PROPOSAL   \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $40,000,000 to Air Pacific Limited, trading as Fiji Airways, for the Fiji Airways COVID-19 \nLiquidity Support Facility Project in Fiji. The report also describes the proposed administration of \na loan of up to $25,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund \n(LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2.  The loan, to be guaranteed by Fiji, will cover Fiji Airways\u2019 fixed costs during the operational \nshutdown, and the working capital requirements for a 2021 ramp-up and restoration of its flight \nservices. Since March 2020, the flight operations of Fiji Airways have been severely interrupted \nby global travel restrictions because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The \nproject supports Fiji Airways\u2019 effort to sustain its business through this crisis and return to \nprofitable operations. Fiji Airways is the South Pacific\u2019s leading airline with a strong safety record, \na new aircraft fleet, and a history of profitable operations. It provides essential transport for Fiji \nand other small island developing states in the South Pacific, and is a foundation for economic \nand social development in the region. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Fiji Airways, Fiji\u2019s national flag carrier airline, is the Pacific\u2019s largest \nregional airline, accounting for 65% of international seat capacity to Fiji and 60% of interregional \nseat capacity, connecting the South Pacific to Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and \nAsia. It provides the majority of international seat capacity to Kiribati and Tuvalu (fragile and \nconflict-affected situation countries), a substantial proportion of capacity to Samoa, Tonga, and \nVanuatu, as well as most domestic flights connecting the Fijian islands. It also provides access to \nbasic commodities and social services by importing essential goods and allowing the local \npopulation  to  connect  to  other  parts  of  the  world.  It  is  therefore  a  fundamental  transport \ninfrastructure for the Fijian and regional economies, which depend on tourism and exports. \n \n4.  Fiji Airways contributes to regional coordination and integration. Because Fiji is a large \nand important Pacific regional distribution center, the carrier facilitates regional emergency \nresponse and recovery efforts, including recovery from periodic regional cyclones. Fiji Airways \nalso plays a critical role in providing access to Fiji\u2019s health care facilities for people from other \nPacific countries, notably Kiribati and Tuvalu, and to tertiary care outside the region, particularly \nin Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. \n \n5.  Prior to the pandemic, Fiji Airways had experienced strong passenger and revenue growth \nand was profitable for 8 years through 2019. The airline has a new aircraft fleet and a strong safety \nrecord, with no aircraft accidents resulting in aircraft losses or passenger fatalities.2 \n \n6.  Impact of COVID-19. The unprecedented global crisis caused by COVID-19 has crippled \nthe aviation and tourism industries. Travel restrictions imposed by governments worldwide to halt \nthe rapid spread of the disease, coupled with consumer reluctance to travel, have crushed \ninternational travel demand, resulting in most airlines grounding most of their aircraft. \n \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  As defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Annex 13. \n ", "2 \n \n7.  Fiji Airways has been affected by COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020, starting with \nweak demand in Asian markets; extending to core markets in Australia, New Zealand, and the \nUnited States; and culminating in the government-imposed shutdown on 22 March 2020 of all \nregularly scheduled Fijian international and domestic flights. As a consequence, Fiji Airways \nsuspended international and regional passenger flights until the end of December 2020. The \nbiggest question now is how long the COVID-19 impact will last and whether the airline has \nenough cash reserves to tide it through. Against this backdrop, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) was requested to provide liquidity support to Fiji Airways to meet its operational cash \nrequirements until normal flight operations can resume. \n \n8.  Project design.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9.  Fiji Airways resumed domestic flights in April 2020 and is now flying regularly scheduled \ndomestic flights at 50% normal capacity. It also instituted regular international cargo service \nflights, including current weekly operations to Sydney; Auckland; Los Angeles; Hong Kong, China; \nand Singapore. Its cargo services assure continued supply of medical and other critical imports \nto the South Pacific as well as exports of fresh produce, seafood, and garments. It has started to \nrehire cabin crew to train and prepare for a resumption of international flights. Fiji Airways \ncoordinated recovery and logistics planning with the Government of Fiji, Airports Fiji, and Fijian \nhotels. They all are completing preparations for a return to international service at an appropriate \ntime between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021 with a \u201cTravel Ready\u201d \nprogram targeted at New Zealand and Australia that includes pre-departure health screening, \nonline check-in, \u201cwellness\u201d staff on each flight, adapted in-flight procedures, \u201ccorridor\u201d customs \nprocessing and transport in Fiji, dedicated Fijian resort packages by nationality, and a marketing \ncampaign. This effort included work with ADB on coordinating COVID-19 recovery programs and \nassistance, including technical assistance to Fiji Airports in airport planning and aviation security.3 \n \n10.  Borrower. Fiji Airways is predominantly a passenger airline (passengers accounted for \n83% of revenues in 2019), and its strategy is to be the leading airline connecting the South Pacific, \nwhere it served 19 direct destinations before the outbreak of COVID-19.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nIts business model is to provide a quality and reliable Pacific regional air service based on its \nmodern, fuel-efficient fleet, which includes A350s and Boeing 737 MAX 8s. As stated before (para. \n5), it has a strong safety record with no aircraft accidents resulting in passenger deaths or aircraft \nhull losses. \n \n11.  Following the appointment of a new chief executive officer in 2015, Fiji Airways embarked \non a program of quality service, fleet renewal, and network expansion, boosting passengers by \n27% over 5 years, to 1.7 million in 2019, and opening up new direct weekly routes connecting the \nPacific to North America (San Francisco), Australia (Adelaide), and Asia (Singapore and Tokyo). \nIn December 2018, Fiji Airways became a OneWorld connect partner and in mid-2019 attained \nthe Skytrax 4-Star quality rating.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n3  ADB. Regional: Pacific Economic Management (Phase 3). \n ", "3 \n12.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence. 4  Fiji  Airways,  its  shareholders,  and  its \nmanagement do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk as \nthere are no unresolved adverse media or relevant information related to them. ADB\u2019s review of \nFiji Airways does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering, \nterrorism financing, tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired. \n \n13.  Guarantor. The project will benefit from a sovereign guarantee provided by Fiji covering \nthe total principal amount of the ADB loan; it was approved by the Parliament of Fiji on 26 May \n2020. This gives significant support to the project, since the borrower\u2019s revenue-generating ability \nwas severely curtailed and remains uncertain because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. \n \n14.  Fiji is one of the most developed economies in the Pacific, and tourism has been the main \ndriver of economic activity and foreign direct investment, contributing gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita of $6,141 in 2019. The economy is projected to contract by 19.8% in 20205 and \nto grow by 1.0% in 2021 under COVID-19 (based on a gradual revival of international travel from \nthe  second  quarter  of  2021).  Tax  cuts  to  boost  economic  activity  and  tourism,  reduced \ngovernment revenue as the economy contracts, and increased spending to counter COVID-19 \nimpacts are projected to widen the fiscal deficit to 20.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2021 (FY2019: \n\u20133.6%, FY2020: \u20138.2%). Public debt as a ratio of GDP was 49.3% at the end of FY2019 and is \nprojected to reach 65.6% of GDP in FY2020, and 83.4% of GDP in FY2021. To mitigate this, Fiji \nis increasing its engagement with development partners, led by ADB, to access lower-cost \nfinancing accompanied by technical assistance. It is also working closely with the International \nMonetary Fund, which carries out regular country surveillance and continues to assess Fiji\u2019s \npublic debt as being sustainable.6 \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs   \n \n15.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impact: Fiji\u2019s status as a vibrant and \nmodern regional and international hub for people and cargo movement enhanced, as suggested \nby the 5-year and 20-year National Development Plan.7 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: international and domestic air \ntransport movements of passenger and goods restored and sustained.8 \n \n17.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) Fiji Airways\u2019 liquidity crisis caused \nby COVID-19 avoided, (ii) workers\u2019 livelihood secured  and gender equality enhanced, and \n(iii) gender equality of the work environment enhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 because it fosters regional cooperation and integration. By supporting Fiji \nAirways, a core transport pillar in the South Pacific, ADB will help preserve connectivity and access \n \n4  ADB. 2003.

The project also promotes private \nsector-led growth in Fiji and, through the gender measures captured in the agreed gender action \nplan, gender equality. It is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project mobilizes \nan ADB interdepartmental team to integrate well-established knowledge and contacts in Fiji with \na private sector financial structure. \n \n19.  The project complements PARD\u2019s long-term, close relationship with the Government of \nFiji as its leading multilateral partner. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Fiji \nhighlights  the  importance  of  promoting  private  sector  investment  and  growth,  including  by \npromoting domestic and regional connectivity through transport infrastructure, and specifically \nhighlighting the need for enterprises that are partly or fully owned by the state to access finance \non commercial terms where feasible, including through potential ADB nonsovereign operations. \nThe transaction also complements the $200 million policy-based loan for subprogram 3 of the \nSustained Private Sector-Led Growth Reform Program, which was approved by the ADB Board \nof Directors in July 2020, and is built on reforms to improve fiscal management, the performance \nof state-owned enterprises, and the business and investment climate. \n \n20.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, through which ADB intends to substantially expand \nthe scale, influence, and effectiveness of its support for regional cooperation.9 The initiative also \nemphasizes private sector participation as an integral part of mainstreaming sustainable transport \nin ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n \n21.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign \nfinancing in Fiji, and its first to an airline. The project benefits from PARD\u2019s leading experience in \nFiji as well as ADB\u2019s experience in structuring and implementing air transport infrastructure such \nas the Mactan Cebu International Passenger Terminal Project (Philippines). \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  State-owned enterprises. Since 2012, Fiji Airways has developed into a successful, well-\nmanaged, and partially privatized company with an established history of profitable operations, \nindependently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It has demonstrated its ability to compete on \nan equal footing and without subsidy against leading international airlines such as Air New \nZealand, Qantas, and Virgin Australia, serving as an example in the Pacific region for a well-\nmanaged state-owned enterprise. ADB\u2019s assistance, reflecting government and international \nsupport to the global air industry during this COVID-19 crisis, will help prepare Fiji Airways\u2019 return \nto profitable operations in the post-pandemic global economy. Fiji Airways already reflects the \nreforms that Fiji is promulgating with regard to its state-owned enterprise sector. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n23.

These are reflected in Fiji\u2019s \nCivil Aviation Acts (1977), which are administered by Fiji\u2019s Department of Civil \nAviation under the Office of the Solicitor-General. The department is \nresponsible for managing bilateral and multilateral air services agreements. It \nalso oversees the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, which is responsible for the \ntechnical regulation of aviation in Fiji. Fiji Airways is subject to regulation by the \nFijian Competition and Consumer Commission for consumer ticket pricing. As a \nmember IATA, Fiji Airways is bound to the IATA Operational Safety Audit \nProgram. Fiji Airways has code-sharing arrangements with 14 other airlines, \nwhich also require reciprocal independent audits. \nManagement  Fiji Airways is managed by an internationally experienced team of chief \nexecutive, chief operations officer, chief financial officer, and general counsel; \nand 8 executive managers. Fiji Airways promotes gender equality, recently \nreinforcing the number of women in senior management (7 out of 28). \nOperational arrangements \n  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nSafety management  According to the audit results conducted by IATA, all employees have received \nsystem  training in the safety management system principles.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s assistance consists of (i) a secured corporate loan of up to $40 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and (ii) a parallel loan of up to $25 million, to be provided by LEAP and \nadministered by ADB.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  Its assistance will play a key role in Fiji Airways\u2019 financing efforts, supported by the \nGovernment of Fiji, to ensure that Fiji Airways transitions through the COVID-19 \ncrisis  and  emerges  with  the  capability  to  resume  its  key  role  in  transport \ninfrastructure for Fiji and other Pacific countries. \n(ii)  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n(iii)  ADB will contribute to promoting gender equality at Fiji Airways by enhancing \nwomen\u2019s participation in technical and managerial roles as well as developing a \npolicy to tackle and mitigate gender-based violence. The project achieves effective \ngender mainstreaming categorization. \n ", "6 \n(iv)  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n(v)  With ADB\u2019s engagement, Fiji Airways agreed to implement a corrective action plan \nto improve the management of environmental risks in its premises, and to improve \nthe implementation of existing plans and procedures. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions  \n \n27.  In compliance with the requirements of its Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for general \ncorporate finance, ADB categorized the project as C for environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples.11 This categorization is based on the understanding that (i) ADB\u2019s \nproceeds  will  not  be  used  by  Fiji  Airways  to  upgrade,  purchase,  manufacture  new  or \ndecommission existing aircraft, open new routes, or acquire land; and (ii) funds will be used only \nto fill the company\u2019s liquidity gap and restore flight operations. Therefore, impacts in addition to \nthose associated with normal pre-pandemic operations are not envisaged. Key environmental \nimpacts  and  risks  associated  with  Fiji  Airways\u2019  operations  include  air  emissions,  noise, \noccupational and public health and safety (including the spread of COVID-19), and wastewater \nand  waste  generation  associated  with  routine  flight  operations,  and  aircraft  and  building \nmaintenance activities performed directly by the company (including refueling of ground vehicles, \nminor maintenance, and cleaning of aircrafts and hangars). \n \n28.  ADB performed a risk-based environmental and social management system audit and \ncorporate  audit  against  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the \nenvironmental, health, and safety (EHS) guidelines of the World Bank Group for airlines. Fiji \nAirways has a dedicated safety, security, and quality team to manage the EHS aspects of its \noperations and systems. It has an occupational health and safety policy, an environmental policy, \nand uses the Rolls-Royce Safety Management System solution to record EHS risk assessments, \nand incidents and associated reports, and monitor performance indicators. Management systems, \nplans, and procedures follow the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, International \nAir Transport Association (IATA), and OneWorld standards. IATA performs biannual operational \nsafety audits of Fiji Airways\u2019 operations. The \u201cTravel Ready\u201d program follows World Health \nOrganization advice along with recommendations by IATA and the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO). \n \n29.  Fiji Airways monitors fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Fiji Airways has \nemissions reduction targets to reduce potential climate change impacts. It files annual reports \nunder IATA's FRED+ (fuel reporting and emissions database) platform, and will prepare the first \nCORSIA (carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) report in 2020 as a \nvoluntary initiative. Fiji Airways has internationally compliant standard operating procedures for \nnoise  abatement  and,  with  Airports  Fiji,  rolled  out  management  measures  to  prevent  bird \ncollisions. It also implemented plans for emergency procedures, and for handling and control of \ndangerous goods, or hazardous waste materials. Aircraft disinfection is performed in line with \nAustralian and New Zealand biosecurity procedures. \n \n \n11 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "7 \n30.  ADB\u2019s corporate audit also concluded that Fiji Airways\u2019 management system and plans \naddress the impacts and risks associated with the company\u2019s normal pre-pandemic operations. \nThe institutional capacity and commitment of the company to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n31.  Fiji Airways will observe ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list and will comply with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.12 It will report annually to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such \nlaws and standards, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with \naffected people, if needed, will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.13 \n \n32.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Fiji has made a number of specific international and \nnational commitments to gender equality, but gender inequality remains rooted in traditional \nnorms, customs, and models of decision making that are perpetuated by discriminatory practices, \nlegislative and policy biases, and unequal access to resources and services. The gender gaps in \nlabor force participation in Fiji are also significant: in 2015, most men aged 15 and above (81%) \nwere employed or actively looking for work, compared with less than half of women (46%). \n \n33. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nFiji Airways operates a company-wide anti-sexual harassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), it has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are to (i) \nincrease the number of women in technical roles; (ii) train female cadets for the first time in its \nnew Fiji Airways Aviation Academy; (iii) increase the number of women in management roles; (iv) \ndevelop and implement a gender inclusion policy to increase the proportion of women recruited, \nretained, and promoted, particularly in technical and management roles; and (v) develop and \nimplement a family violence policy. Fiji Airways will submit periodic reports on its implementation \nof gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  Fiji Airways was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n35.  The project will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign transaction in Fiji and the first in the airline \nindustry. The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n \n12 ADB. 2003. Social Protection.
