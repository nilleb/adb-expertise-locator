It has the largest provincial economic base in the country, \naccounting for over 50% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nWhile the province has achieved robust economic growth in recent \nyears, its social indicators have lagged behind those of the other South \nAsian countries. The government of Punjab (GoPb) has placed high \npriority on the attainment of MDGs, and has recently increased budget \nallocations to social sectors. The province is likely to achieve all MDGs \nexcept reduction of the infant mortality rate (MDG4) from 77 to 40 per \n1000 live births, and the maternal mortality ratio (MDG5) from 300 to \n140 per 100,000 live births. More serious efforts are needed to attain \nthese two essential health MDGs. If they are achieved, Punjab can \npotentially  save  the  lives  of  at  least  11,000  women  and \n235,000 children by 2015. \n \nRecognizing the critical need, the GoPb has developed a health sector \nreform framework, and has sought support from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to accelerate attainment of the two health MDGs. At a \nbroader level, it has initiated service delivery reforms as part of the \nADB-supported Public Resource Management Program and the Punjab \nDevolved Social Services Program. The former aims to improve the \noperational efficiency of the provincial government and thereby create \nfiscal  space  for  social  service  delivery,  while  the  latter  aims  to \nstrengthen  district  systems  and  develop  necessary  service  delivery \nstandards  for  devolved  social  services,  including  health,  education, \nwater supply, and sanitation. \n \n ", "ii     \nADB  has  been  committed  to  MDGs  since  2002.  The  attainment  of \nMDGs will help achieve inclusive economic growth, a key objective of \nADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020), \nwhich encourages ADB member countries to promote greater access to \nopportunities  by  expanding  human  capacities,  especially  for  the \ndisadvantaged,  through  investments  in  education,  health,  and  basic \nsocial protections. In line with Strategy 2020, the PMDGP focuses on \ngovernance  of  health  service  delivery  and  management  of  public \nresources.  Moreover,  the  PMDGP  adopts  a  programmatic  modality, \nwhich  by  leveraging  policy  and  institutional  reforms  is  expected  to \nensure  sustained  GoPb  focus  on  health  sector  needs  beyond  the \nmedium term, unlike stand-alone project interventions. \nThe PMDGP is an integral part of the Punjab Government Efficiency \nImprovement Program Cluster approved by ADB in December 2007.  \nProgram  The  PMDGP  marks  a  major  priority  shift  by  the  Punjab  Health \nDescription  Department from quantity to quality of health care, from fragmented to \nconsolidated health service, and from tertiary to primary and secondary \nhealth care. The impact of the PMDGP is the attainment of MDGs \nrelating  to  the  reduction  of  the  infant  mortality  rate  and  maternal \nmortality  ratio  in  Punjab  Province.  The  Program\u2019s  outcome  will  be \nimproved access, quality, and equity of health services. The Program \nwill  assist  the  GoPb  in  undertaking  health  sector  reforms  in  the \nfollowing areas.  \n(i)  Improving  the  Availability  and  Quality  of  Primary  and \nSecondary Health Services. PMDGP will help GoPb ensure \nthe  implementation  of  certain  minimum  service  delivery \nstandards (MSDS) for primary and secondary health services, \nthrough  incorporation  of  the  MSDS  in  provincial  and  district \nhealth sector plans, and by increasing the quality and quantity of \nhuman resources in the health sector.  \n(ii)  Strengthening  Management  of  Health  Service  Delivery. \nPMDGP will help the GoPb improve the daily management of \nhealth service delivery by reducing delays in the procurement of \nessential  drugs,  institutionalizing  the  contracting  of  health \nservices  to  nongovernment  organizations,  and  improving  the \nexisting performance monitoring and evaluation systems.  \n \n(iii)  Establishing  a  Sustainable  Pro-Poor  Health  Financing \nSystem. PMDGP will assist the GoPb in substantially increasing \nthe  health  care  budget  and  improving  planning  and \nmanagement of the budget, introducing a targeted program for \nreducing out-of-pocket health expenditure among the poor, and \ndeveloping  a  sustainable  health  care  financing  and  provider \npayment system. \n ", "    iii\nFinancing Plan  Full  implementation  of  the  MSDS  is  projected  to  cost  GoPb \nPRs34 billion ($425 million) over 2008-2011. The first phase of MSDS \nimplementation, with focus on maternal, neonatal, and child health, will \ncost about PRs7 billion ($88 million) apart from expenditure for capacity \nbuilding and enhancement of information systems. Overall, health and \nsafety-net related public expenditures are estimated at $735 million for \nFY2009. For subprogram 1, given the significant pro-poor impact of the \nproposed measures, ADB will provide a loan of $100 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. For subsequent programs, $200 \nmillion\u2013$300  million  in  total  is  envisaged,  depending  on  reform \nprogress, expenditure requirements and the availability of resources. \n   \n  The loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have an interest rate \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter, a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The \nBorrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Government of \nPakistan will relend the local currency generated from the proceeds of \nthe loan to GoPb. The terms and conditions will be the same as those \nextended by ADB to the Borrower.  \nCounterpart Funds  The local currency counterpart funds generated from the loan will be \nused to increase the GoPb\u2019s health sector budget, and transferred to \nthe district governments, earmarked for implementing MSDS.  \n \nProgram Period and  The implementation period for PMDGP subprogram 1 is from January \nTranche Release  to  October  2008.  The  indicative  implementation  period  for \nsubprogram 2 is November 2008\u2013November 2009; for subprogram 3, it \nis January\u2013December 2010. The loans supporting the subprograms of \nthe PMDGP will be disbursed in a single tranche subject to satisfactory \ncompletion  of  all  policy  actions  applicable  for  the  respective \nsubprogram,  and  effectiveness  of  the  respective  subprogram.  Upon \ncompletion  of  all  subprograms,  the  PMDGP  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 30 June 2011.  \n   \nExecuting Agency   The Health Department of GoPb will be the Executing Agency.  \n   \nImplementation  The program management unit for the Health Sector Reform Program \nArrangements  will  be  responsible  for  daily  coordination  and  management  of  the \nPMDGP. The existing program steering committee for the health sector \nreform  program\u2014chaired  by  chairman  of  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Board, comprising the secretary of health, secretary of \nfinance, secretary of local government and community development, \nand health care providers as members\u2014will be the program steering \ncommittee for the PMDGP and oversee policy decisions. The program \nsteering committee will meet at least once every 6 months. A working \ngroup will be constituted for developing pro-poor health care financing \nand provider payment.  \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries, excluding the items specified in a negative \n ", "iv     \nlist  of  ineligible  items  (and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources).  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting import documentation will be required if, during each year \nthat  the  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nPakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto  be  disbursed  during  that  year.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will \ncertify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. Disbursements will be made under the simplified procedures \nfor program loans.  \n   \nProgram Benefits  Improved Access and Quality of Primary and Secondary Health \nand Impacts  Care  Services.  By  helping  Punjab  attain  the  health  MDGs,  the \nproposed Program could potentially save up to 11,000 women\u2019s lives \nand 235,000 lives of infants by 2015 compared to the scenario without \nprogram  support.  This  would  be  contingent,  however,  on  additional \ninvestments being made by the GoPb. By helping district governments \nto  endorse  and  implement  MSDS,  the  Program  will  ensure  that \nstandards are followed across the province.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  Poor  people  have  the  worst  health  outcomes. \nThey are pushed further into poverty because of ill health\u2014resulting in \nlower productivity or loss of daily wages, and burden of health care \nexpenditure. Although public health care is in principle free, patients \noften have to pay a substantial amount because of missing drugs and \nsupplies at public health facilities. The proposed Program will reduce \nthe health care burden and the risks of falling seriously ill through timely \nhealth interventions, by making quality care available and affordable at \npublic  facilities  through  a  targeted  program,  and  through  the \ndevelopment of an equitable health financing system.  \n \nEconomic Impact. Improved public financial management in the health \nsector and better strategic planning skills in the Health Department will \ncontribute to increased value for money of public spending. Provision of \nconditional grants to district governments for MDG-related interventions \nwill ease the district governments\u2019 resource limitation while ensuring \nthat  social  sectors  are  protected  from  expenditure  cuts.  Increased \naccess to and quality of public health services will also have a direct \npoverty reducing impact by reducing the burden of health expenditures \non the poor.  \n \nSustainable  and  Efficient  Health  Care  Financing  System.  The \nProgram will increase and improve the efficiency of the public stream of \nhealth care financing while supporting development of alternative health \ncare  financing  systems  that  may  pool  different  financial  resources. \nStrengthened  internal  controls  and  increased  transparency  in  the \nallocation  of  resources  will  ensure  that  public  funds  are  spent  in \naccordance to needs and that resource leakage is minimized.  \n ", "    v\n \nInstitutional Impact. Establishment of the strategy and policy unit and \nfinancial management cell within the Health Department will ensure that \npolicies  and  strategies  are  properly  defined,  corresponding  actions \nplanned,  and  resources  allocated  accordingly;  and  that  the  budget \npreparation and execution process is owned at the managerial level. \nRevitalization of the internal audit wing and of the departmental account \ncommittees in the Health Department, and appointing internal auditors \nat district governments, will increase accountability for the use of public \nfunds.  \n  \nRisks  Revisions to the Decentralization Framework. The future of the local \ngovernment system under the present political setup may be at risk. \nWhile a drastic reversal of the devolved setup is unlikely, changes in \nthe  current  attribution  of  power  and  authority  across  levels  of \ngovernment may occur. However, the health sector is likely to remain \ndevolved  given  the  ground  level  implementation  requirements. \nRegardless, the flexibility built into the cluster approach is suitable for \nchanging the implementation arrangements.  \n \nGovernance Risks. As in any complex environment with capacity and \nresource constraints, there are governance risks in the areas of public \nfinancial management, expenditure planning and control, procurement, \nand anticorruption. As a program loan, the PMDGP deliberately and \nexplicitly puts governance and public expenditure management issues \nat the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the PMDGP \nwill positively affect the current institutional setup in the health sector \nand address these governance risks. The change in public financial \nmanagement practices and the emphasis on results-based allocation of \nresources is likely to encounter resistance from middle management \nofficials who have vested interests in perpetuating the current situation. \nThe  strong  commitment  to  reform  at  the  highest  political  and \nbureaucratic level within the Health Department will help mitigate this \nrisk.  In  addition,  internal  and  external  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and publicizing the performance are expected to change the \nsituation gradually. The PMDGP has built-in third party assessments, \nincluding a citizen satisfaction survey, as policy conditions.  \n \nImplementation  Risks.  The  proposed  Program  is  building  on  the \nachievements of the Punjab Devolved Social Services Program and the \nPublic  Resource  Management  Program,  but  still  requires  technical \nassistance (TA) support for capacity building of district governments \nand  the  Office  of  the  Director  General,  Health  Services;  and  for \ndesigning  health  care  financing.  Based  on  past  implementation \nproblems encountered in TA loans in Pakistan, a deliberate decision \nwas taken against a TA loan for the PMDGP. The Health Department is \ncoordinating  with  the  PDSSP  program  management  unit  to  utilize \nresources from an ongoing $20 million TA grant attached to the Punjab \nDevolved Social Services Program (financed by the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom) to mitigate the risk.  \n \n ", "vi     \nExternal  and  Macroeconomic  Risks.  The  recent  upsurge  in \ninternational  commodity  prices  is  having  an  adverse  impact  on \nPakistan\u2019s macroeconomic  indicators.  The  global  financial  turmoil  is \nalso likely to affect the economy. While recurrent and development \nexpenditures  need  to  be  managed  carefully,  essential  pro-poor \ninvestments in health and education are likely to be preserved at the \nfederal  and  provincial  levels.  Finally,  the  political  commitment  to \ninvestments in social sectors will protect pro-poor investments from \nbudget cuts.  \n \n ", "63o  00'E 73o  00'E 74o  00'E\nNORTH-WEST\nFRONTIER\nTarbela PAKISTAN\n35 o 00'N Dam 35 o 00'N\nISLAMABAD PUNJAB MILLENNIUM\nPeshawar Mangla\nAFGHANISTAN Indus R.SargoJhdehluam R.ChJenhaebD luRa.mm DEVELOPMENT GOALS PROGRAM\nLahore\nP U N J A BRavi R.\nMultan\nQuetta Sutlej R\nPAKISTAN\nNORTH-WEST\nB A L O C H I S T A N\nIRAN R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Millennium Development \nGoals  Program  (PMDGP)  comprising  three  subprograms,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for \nsubprogram 1 of the PMDGP.1 \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Fiscal year (FY) 2008 has witnessed a reversal of the sustained growth path that has \ncharacterized the Pakistan economy since early 2000s. For the first time since FY2003, the \neconomy has posted a real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate below 6%, caused by \nboth domestic and international developments. During FY2008, domestic supply shocks and \nrising international food and fuel prices have pushed inflation above 25%. After 2 years of \nmodest increase, the fiscal deficit\u2013GDP ratio rose to 7.4% in FY2008, breaching the 4% of GDP \nthreshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2005. Higher global food and fuel prices have \naffected the budget through higher subsidies for oil, wheat, electricity, and fertilizers. During \nFY2008, government borrowing from the central bank has almost doubled, as it has been a \nmain source of deficit financing2 in the presence of a deteriorating external account. The current \naccount deficit has deteriorated (about 8% against a target 5%) because of higher imports, \ndriven by higher prices and strong aggregate demand, and lower exports, especially in the \ntextile sector. The capital account surplus has also deteriorated because of a decline in foreign \ndirect investments and lower portfolio investments. On the other hand, the growth in remittances \n(17.4%) has not been sufficient to offset the decline in other components of the capital account. \nThe progressive depletion of foreign exchange reserves has led to a sharp depreciation (22%) \nof the Pakistan rupee against the US dollar since July 2007. In order to restore stability, the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  has  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  on  20  November  2008  seeking  a \n$7.6 billion stand-by arrangement from the International Monetary Fund, as part of which broad-\nranging macroeconomic reforms have been agreed upon. \n \n3.  Punjab contributes more than 50% of the Pakistan\u2019s GDP and is home to 56% of its total \npopulation. Punjab\u2019s GDP growth rate for FY2007 was estimated at 7.8%. The slowdown of the \nnational economy is likely to impact Punjab\u2019s economy as well. Although reliable data on GDP \ngrowth projections are not available, revised budget figures for FY2008 and budget estimates \nfor FY2009 provide some insights as to the effects of the economic slowdown on the provincial \neconomy.  These  point  to  a  widening  budget  deficit  mostly  caused  by  shrinking  revenue \nreceipts.3 General revenue receipts have decreased by 11% because of lower tax (\u201318%) and \nnon-tax (\u201330%) revenues and lower federal transfers (\u20133%) and grants (\u201334%) during FY2008. \nTotal expenditures have been lower than budgeted (\u20138%) mainly because of lower development \nspending (\u201313%). \n \n4.  The provincial budget for FY2009 contains a subsidy package of PRs13 billion in the \nform  of  cash  transfers  to  the  poorest  to  compensate  for  higher  food  prices  and  maintain \naffordability of health services. For FY2009, Punjab\u2019s share of the national financial commission \naward will be 25% higher than in FY2008 because of the federal government\u2019s decision to \nincrease the general sales tax on consumer goods and services from 15% to 16%, which may \nhelp meet the additional expenditures somewhat. Provincial tax revenues will increase by 8%, \n                                                 \n1 Appendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework for the PMDGP. \n2 The Government\u2019s outstanding borrowings with the State Bank of Pakistan has almost doubled over FY2008. \n3 According to FY2008 budget estimates, the fiscal deficit was estimated at about PRs37.315 billion. Revised \nestimates released in March 2008 point to a larger deficit of about PRs46.5 billion.  \n ", "2   \nwhile total spending will also rise by 8%. The overall financing gap is expected to be lower than \nthe (revised) figure for FY2008.4 \n \n5.  Against this backdrop of fiscal constraints, GoPb has been able to preserve health \nsector spending from drastic cuts. Although starting from a low base, per capita health spending \nby the public sector has been increasing in recent years\u2014$4.4 in FY2007; $5.77 in FY2008 \n(revised estimates); and $6.38 in FY2009 (budget estimates). Yet, this is far less than the \nresource allocation in comparable South Asian countries.5  \n \n6.  GoPb has sought support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to bolster its efforts \nto  increase  the  quality  of  and  access  to  key  social  services,  especially  by  improving \nmanagement of service delivery and public resources. GoPb has been undertaking education \nsector reforms for the last several years with the World Bank\u2019s program support, and has seen \neducation Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators improve. On the other hand, health \nMDGs have shown very little improvement. In line with the thrust of ADB\u2019s recently approved \nlong-term strategic framework (Strategy 2020),6 the PMDGP will support health sector reforms \nwith the objective of promoting inclusive growth, by improving access\u2014particularly of the poor\u2014\nto  quality  health  care.  As  a  programmatic  operation,  the  PMDGP  will  not  directly  finance \nconstruction  of  health  facilities,  and  it  will  approach  health  sector  and  public  financial \nmanagement reforms with the goal of improving the overall efficiency of the public sector, in line \nwith  the  thrust  of  Strategy  2020.  ADB  has  been  working  with  GoPb  through  the  Punjab \nDevolved Social Services Program (PDSSP)7 for the past 3 years. It has also provided support \nfor broad-based public sector resource management reforms through the Punjab Resource \nManagement  Program  (PRMP) 8  from  2003\u20132007,  and  through  the  Punjab  Government \nEfficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP)9 approved in December 2007. At the request of GoPb, \nthe conceptual framework for the proposed PMDGP was included as part of the PGEIP.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n7.  At the national level, Pakistan recognizes the need to improve health outcomes as an \nimportant part of the Government\u2019s poverty alleviation plan. Pakistan\u2019s National Health Policy \n200110 prioritizes  primary  and  secondary  health  care,  and  emphasizes  the  need  for  good \ngovernance as the basis of health sector reform. However, the national policy has not been \nimplemented effectively because of resource and capacity constraints, and the absence of a \nconcrete action plan with measurable outputs. As a result, Pakistan compares poorly on infant \nand maternal mortality indicators among the South Asian countries (Table 1). Pakistan also lags \nbehind comparable countries with respect to public as well as private expenditures on health \n                                                 \n4  FY2009 budget estimates point to a fiscal deficit of PRs27 billion.  \n5  Appendix 2, Table A2.2. \n6 ADB. 2008.

Punjab has the highest under-five mortality rate and an infant mortality rate (IMR) \nthat  surpasses  other  countries  in  the  region,  although  it  compares  favorably  on  maternal \nmortality in relation to other countries in South Asia. In Pakistan the IMR is higher in rural than \nurban areas, and among boys than girls (80 for boys and 73 for girls). Higher levels of women\u2019s \neducation and household wealth correlate with a lower IMR and maternal mortality ratio (MMR). \n \nTable 1: Key Health Indicators for Pakistan and Punjab \nin Comparison with Selected Countries \n \nCountry  Infant Mortality Ratea  Under-Five Mortality Rateb  Maternal Mortality Ratioa \nBhutan  65  75  420 \nBangladesh  54  57  380 \nIndia  56  74  540 \nNepal  56  74  740 \nSri Lanka  12  14  92 \nPakistan  80  99  500 \nPunjabc  77  112  300 \n  a United Nations Population Fund. 2007.

Recognizing the challenges, GoPb has demonstrated a strong commitment in recent \nyears to broad-based inclusive growth. It has embarked on social sector reforms with its own \nresources as well as support from the international community. MDG attainment has been given \nprominence in Punjab\u2019s medium-term development agenda. Yet, while the province is likely to \nachieve most MDGs by the targeted date of 2015, it is seriously lagging behind on two important \ngoals\u2014MDG4, which includes reducing the IMR; and MDG5, in reducing the MMR. Without \nsignificant and concerted additional efforts and wide-ranging reforms in health service delivery \nand improvements in health care financing, the province is unlikely to reach these two MDGs \n(Appendix  3).  Failure  on  this  front  would  have  serious  implications,  given  the  size  of  the \nprovince and its contribution to Pakistan\u2019s economy.   \n \n9.  The Health Department\u2019s targets and the associated health service indicators for the \nIMR and MMR are in Table 2.  \nTable 2: Key Health MDGs and Associated Indicators for Punjab \n \nTargeting Indicators   FY2004a  FY2007b  2015 Targets \nInfant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births  77  71  40 \nUnder-Five Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births  112  102  47 \nMaternal Mortality Ratio per 100,000 Live Births  300  300  140 \nPercentage of Births Attended by Skilled Birth Attendants  32  38  100 \nPercentage of Fully Immunized Children (12\u201323 months old)  50  79.7  Above 80 \nMDG = Millennium Development Goal. \n a Government of the Punjab. 2004.

The IMR in Punjab has declined from 115 in 1996\u20131997 to 77 in 2003\u20132004. About 70% \nof infant deaths in Pakistan and Punjab occur during the neonatal period,11 the majority of which \n                                                 \n11 National Institute of Population Studies (Pakistan) and Macro International Inc. 2008. Pakistan Demographic and \nHealth Survey 2006-07. Islamabad. \n ", "4   \nhappen  during  the  first  7  days  of  life.  The  percentage  of  births  attended  by  skilled  birth \nattendants  remains  very  low.  Only  a  third  of  the  deliveries  take  place  at  health  facilities. \nAccording to the District-Based Multiple-indicators Cluster Survey, 2003-04,12 the IMR in Punjab \ndoes not show a significant difference by gender (81 for boys and 73 for girls), while the \ndifference between major cities and rural areas is large (82 for rural areas, 74 for urban areas, \nand 55 for major cities). The urban\u2013rural disparity in health indicators reflects the historical \nurban bias of health spending, i.e., the main part of public health expenditure has been in \ntertiary hospitals in major cities, at the expense of investments in district level health services, \nespecially in rural areas.  \n11.  Timely use of quality primary and secondary health care by the poor, especially women \nand children in rural areas, is the key to attaining the MDGs relating to the IMR and MMR. The \nPunjab Local Government Ordinance (PLGO) has made the district governments responsible \nfor primary and secondary health services, which are the key to attaining MDGs, whereas the \nprovincial Health Department has retained responsibility for policy setting for the entire sector; \nperformance monitoring; and the provision of tertiary care services, medical education, and \nresearch and development. Punjab\u2019s primary health service system consists of 293 rural health \ncenters (RHCs), 2,456 basic health units (BHUs), and 188 maternal and child health centers. \nFor secondary health services, there are 35 district headquarter hospitals (DHQs) and 77 tehsil \nheadquarter hospitals (THQs). Punjab has over 140,000 health department employees spread \nacross its 35 districts.  \n12.  Realizing that health MDGs would not be attained without wide-ranging health sector \nreforms, GoPb has developed a health sector reform framework as part of the ADB-supported \nPRMP. It has also designed a Health Sector Reform Program (HSRP), which has been under \nimplementation with GoPb\u2019s own financing since 2006.13 In parallel, GoPb has taken measures \nto strengthen district level social service delivery systems through the PDSSP. GoPb has also \nadopted minimum service delivery standards (MSDS) for health services through PDSSP.  \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n13.  In Punjab, the health system consists of two parallel streams. The budget-based public \nhealth system provides health care to any user of a public facility, with negligible official user \ncharges. The private health care system is largely unregulated and charges fees for services. \nQualified private providers mainly cater to urban populations who can afford the fees. Public \nsector spending accounts for less than 20% of total expenditures, with privately provided and \nprocured health care dominating the sector. Yet, for the rural poor, public health facilities are \noften the only choice for receiving qualified and affordable medical care.  \n14.  Despite the massive network of public primary and secondary health facilities, coverage \nof basic health services remains low (Appendix 4). The reasons for low coverage of basic health \nservices include limited availability and low quality of services, and suboptimal health-seeking \nbehavior. Public primary health care has been largely underutilized mainly because of the \nabsence of doctors, unavailability of drugs, and unreliable and poor quality of services. The \nbiggest obstacle for improving quality is the absence of doctors and paramedics, and the poor \nquality  of  their  training.  The  day-to-day  management  of health  services  has  suffered  from \ninadequate  capacity,  challenges  in  recruiting  and  posting  motivated  doctors  and  other \nprofessionals in rural and remote areas, rigid administrative procedures, inefficient and lengthy \nprocurement processes for drugs and medical supplies, and lack of performance monitoring to \n                                                 \n12 GoPb. 2004. District-Based Multi Indicators Cluster Survey 2003-04. Lahore.  \n13 The HSRP has focused on rehabilitation of primary health facilities and incentives for doctors at BHUs. \n ", "  5\nidentify problems and solutions periodically. With health sector spending less than 2% of total \npublic expenditures, the public health service has been severely underfinanced, and the limited \nresources available have not been effectively allocated or used. \n15.  Public health service in Pakistan is financed and managed by governments at three \ndifferent levels\u2014federal, provincial, and district. The 2001 PLGO devolved responsibility for \nprimary and secondary health service delivery to district governments. However, this devolution \nwas not supported by sufficient structural changes and capacity building efforts for the Health \nDepartment, especially for the Office of Director General, Health Services (ODGHS), and for \ndistrict  governments.  District  governments  remain  dependent  on  provincial  fiscal  transfers. \nAlthough budget planning and execution is transferred to district governments, there is limited \nplanning  and  management  capacity  at  district  health  departments.  The  approval  of  health \nworkers\u2019 posts in primary and secondary health care facilities largely remain with the Health \nDepartment, not with district governments, while the recruitment of lower level posts has been \nshifted to district governments\u2019 responsibility. No mechanism has been developed yet to monitor \nthe performance of the district health departments. Federally-financed health programs have \ntheir own implementation and reporting mechanisms, and their coordination and information-\nsharing with district health departments is often limited.  \n16.  Figure 1 illustrates the key challenges facing the attainment of the two critical health \nMDGs in Punjab. In summary, the delivery of maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) \nservice in Punjab suffers from three main problems: \n(i)  low quality and uneven adherence to service delivery norms, \n(ii)  poor management of health service delivery, and \n(iii)  inadequate financing and weak fiduciary systems. \n1.  Need for Implementing Service Delivery Standards \n17.  The demand for, and spending on, private health care is higher because the public \nperceive the quality of private health care to be better than that at public health facilities. Low \nquality, lack of standardized provision of health services within and across health facilities, lack \nof adequate human resources, and lack of drugs and medical supplies have been the main \nimpediments resulting in the low utilization of BHUs and RHCs. The public either chooses to use \nunqualified health care providers or home treatment, or go to hospitals even for minor illnesses. \nThis  has  resulted  in  delays  in  seeking  appropriate  health  care  when  needed  as  well  as \novercrowded hospitals. \n18.  Both the federal and provincial governments are allowed to set health sector policies. \nAlthough the GoPb does not have a health sector policy specific to Punjab, the National Health \nPolicy gives a reasonable vision, focusing on (i) poverty alleviation, (ii) primary and secondary \nhealth care, and (iii) good governance. However, it does not specify the steps and outputs \nrequired for realizing the vision or MDGs. Without specifying what services are provided at \nwhich level of health care by whom, and the minimum acceptable quality for different types of \nservices to achieve the goals, it has been impossible to translate the policy and the MDG \ncommitment of GoPb into investments and action plans.  \n ", "6   \nFigure 1: Problem Tree for the Punjab Health Care System \nPoor Health Outcome \nPoor Health Status  Poverty \nHigh MMR and IMR \nLack of Timely Use of  \nBurden of Health \nQuality Health Services \nExpenditure \nLack of Pro-Poor  \nLimited Availability of \nHealth Financing \nQuality Health Care \nPoor Health  Absence of Skilled  \nFacilities  Health Workers \nLack of Equipment,   Reluctance to be  \nInadequate Training\nDrugs Supplies  Posted in Rural Areas \nLack of Private \nPoor Enforcement of Standards \nSector Regulations \nPoor Resource \nUnder-Financing \nManagement \n \nIMR=infant mortality rate, MMR=maternal mortality ratio. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  The MSDS notified in Punjab in December 2007 have filled this crucial gap. They were \ndeveloped  through  consultations  involving  provincial  and  district  health  officials  and  public \nhealth specialists, based on reviews of service delivery standards in other South Asian countries \n(Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka); the international evidence-based standards set by the \nWorld Health Organization for developing countries; and existing services in Punjab. The MSDS \ndefine the minimum package of services that the public is entitled to, a set of performance \nindicators and minimum acceptable levels of performance by service providers at each level of \nhealth care, and the required physical and human resource requirements. To facilitate the \nimplementation  of  MSDS,  GoPb  has  also  developed  comprehensive  referral  guidelines, \nstandard operating procedures (SOPs), and standard medical protocols (SMPs). MSDS, SOPs, \nand SMPs together have well-defined accountability parameters at each level of health care, for \n ", "  7\ndifferent health professionals, and benchmarks against which performance of the health system \nas a whole and that of each worker will be monitored and evaluated.  \n20.  Implementation of the MSDS, SOPs, SMPs, and the referral system will help attain the \nMDGs  and  lead  to  an  overall  improvement  in  public  health  through  better  primary  and \nsecondary health care. These standards and protocols need to be updated periodically based \non emerging requirements. In parallel, building capacity for evidence-based medicine will be a \nmedium-term requirement.  \n21.  The lack of well-trained human resources is the biggest constraint in implementing \nMSDS. To implement the MNCH-related MSDS successfully, it is critical to have adequate and \nwell-qualified and skilled women medical officers (WMOs), midwives, nurses, female health \nvisitors, and paramedics. Currently, about 22% of the approved posts for various health workers \nat BHUs and RHCs in Punjab are vacant. Among the medical staff, the highest (32%) proportion \nof vacant posts is for the WMO. Similarly, 37% of the approved posts for nurses at BHUs and \nRHCs are currently vacant. At DHQs, almost one third of the approved posts of gynecologists \nand anesthetists are vacant. The situation is even worse at THQs, where 48% of the approved \nposts of gynecologists and 59% of anesthetists\u2019 posts are vacant. 14 \n \n22.  To implement MNCH-related MSDS effectively, about 14,000 new posts need to be \napproved and filled. They include about 660 specialists (primarily gynecologists, obstetricians, \nanesthetists,  and  pediatricians);  about  1,550  medical  officers  (including  WMOs);  about \n5,000 nurses; 3,000 each of lady health visitors and midwives; and 1,000 paramedics. The \nshortage is especially pronounced among paramedics and nurses. Against this requirement, \nPunjab produces about 1,400\u20131,600 nurses and 350 lady health visitors per year. In addition, \n39,000  nurses  have  been  registered  until  2006.  Therefore,  once  posts  are  approved,  a \nsubstantial part of them are expected to be filled in the next 2 years. For some posts, however, \nadditional measures may be necessary for attracting health workers to the posts. For example, \nPunjab produces a large number of doctors\u2014including female doctors\u2014in relation to nurses, \nbut the availability of WMOs (particularly in rural areas) is a challenge as many female doctors \nleave the profession or opt to practice in urban areas. GoPb has introduced incentives for \ndoctors posted at BHUs. As a result, their vacancies at BHUs have significantly reduced for the \nlast 2 years.  \n \n23.  Apart from the quantitative challenge, there are serious quality concerns in the health \nprofession. Some of the medical training institutions in Punjab do not appear to apply any \nstringent quality standards. In addition, there is no continuous education system to enable \ndoctors to update their knowledge and skills regularly. Further, the quality of paramedics is not \nup to required standards. For instance, the entrance requirement for dispensers is only 10 years \nof schooling. Since 1947, only about 35,000 dispensers have been qualified out of 1.2 million \nwho appeared for the exam after a year of training. The quality of training offered is very low \nmainly because of lack of qualified trainers. Consequently, the quality of the paramedics is low \nand they are ill-prepared to offer quality care.   \n  \n24.  The HSRP has made substantial headway in closing gaps in physical infrastructure and \nstaff requirements. Vacant positions at RHCs and BHUs are being filled through monetary \nincentives for doctors. Absenteeism is actively checked. Correspondingly, the utilization rates of \nRHCs  and  BHUs  are  increasing,  albeit  slowly.  The  federal  MNCH  program  also  plans  to \nupgrade the maternal wards and delivery rooms of DHQs, THQs, and RHCs. The federal \n                                                 \n14 GoPb. 2008. HSRP database. Lahore.  \n ", "8   \ngovernment\u2019s plan to increase coverage of lady health workers who provide preventive health \ncare and health education in the community is expected to improve people\u2019s health-seeking \nbehavior. It is critical that the PMDGP help Punjab sustain reforms and investments, and ensure \nstaff retention to improve the quality of health care provision for MNCH. \n \n2.  Need for Improved Management of Health Service Delivery \n25.  Management and Performance Monitoring. One of the lessons from the PDSSP is \nthat district governments require substantial technical assistance (TA) to develop and manage a \nrational and strategic action plan. ODGHS, which was responsible for delivering district health \nservices before the 2001 devolution, is now responsible for providing TA to district governments \nand monitoring performance of health services in districts. The structure and capacity of the \noffice, however, has not been adjusted to its new responsibilities; consequently, there is a \nserious vacuum of monitoring and supervision. The office still has 10 senior directors and \n350 supporting staff, and in some cases continues to work on services that are supposed to \nhave been devolved. On the other hand, the district health departments are left to assume \nresponsibilities  for  primary  and  secondary  health  service  delivery,  without  the  Health \nDepartment\u2019s technical support.  \n \n26.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) cannot be effective in the absence of a comprehensive \ninformation  system.  There  is  no  consolidated  source  in  place  that  provides  reliable  and \ncomprehensive health information on time to those managing health services. At the provincial \nlevel,  the  HSRP  has  its  own  effective  mechanism  of  collecting  information  through  M&E \nassistants whereas ODGHS collects routine information from health facilities through executive \ndistrict  officers  (EDOs),  Health.  Federal  or  provincial  vertical  programs  and  donor-funded \nprojects have their own mechanisms to collect information through their respective district and \nsubdistrict coordinators. In addition, a number of studies and community surveys are being \nundertaken by  various stakeholders. However, the collected information is hardly used for \nimproving health services, particularly at the local level.  \n \n27.  Recently  the  Health  Department  has  pilot  tested  a  comprehensive  district  health \ninformation system (DHIS), which can generate information on indicators related to service \ndelivery, human resources, financial management, logistics, capital assets, and regulations. \nDHIS is gradually becoming operational in the pilot districts. Districts\u2019 capacity is the major \nconstraint in rapid expansion. The posts for a director at ODGHS for DHIS have only recently \nbeen filled and district DHIS related officers\u2019 posts have not yet been filled. DHIS will be an \nimportant instrument for the Health Department to monitor district health service performance \nand adjust its strategies.  \n28.  Drug Procurement. There is a shortage of drugs across primary and secondary health \nfacilities. While inadequate budget allocation is one key reason, cumbersome drug procurement \nprocedures seem to be another major cause. Efficient procurement of drugs is an essential part \nof the drug management cycle, and plays a key role in ensuring cost-effective and timely \navailability of quality drugs and medicines. Drug procurement absorbs a substantial portion of \nthe health budget of each facility. For these reasons, good procurement systems are vital\u2014not \njust for health service delivery but also for ensuring efficient use of public funds.  \n29.  In Punjab, essential drugs are supposed to be provided free at any public facility. After \nthe 2001 devolution, each district government has become responsible for purchasing the drugs \nand medicines in the essential drug list defined at the federal level. After contracts are awarded, \n ", "  9\nthe supplier delivers the drugs to each facility and a sample of each batch is submitted to the \ndrug test laboratory for testing before payment to the supplier can be authorized. \n \n30.  The decentralized procedure, however, showed its limitation through large differences in \nprocurement prices across district governments. Therefore, since FY2008, GoPb has introduced \na partial centralization of the procurement process under which the Health Department, through \nits procurement cell, would be responsible for determining the price range on behalf of all district \ngovernments. However, the procurement cycle and awarding of contracts are protracted. The \nprocess only starts on 31 August of each fiscal year, as prescribed by the purchase manual, \nand it is expected to be completed by mid-October. As a result, district governments could start \nprocuring  the  needed  supplies  of  drugs  and  medicines  only  around  October,  sometimes \nextending to January or February, leaving district governments to complete drug procurement \nwithin the remaining few months of the fiscal year. Similarly, the drug test laboratory is flooded \nwith requests for drug testing just for these few months. This mismatch between the financial \ncycle of the district governments and their procurement process increases the risk of drug \nshortages in case of delays in the award of the procurement contract.  \n31.  There is a need to define a uniform and accepted procedure for procurement, streamline \nthe current process and its timing, and ensure that the compiled listings of drugs and supplies \nby each facility are updated and made consistent with both the facility needs and the essential \ndrug list.  \n32.  Alternative  Service  Delivery  Models.  Punjab  has  tried  two  models  of  contracting \nhealth service delivery, one with the Punjab Rural Support Program (PRSP) and the other with \nthe National Commission for Human Development (NCHD). The PRSP has covered BHUs in \n12 districts to date, while NCHD has covered one district and may be expanded to other districts. \nThe PRSP has managed BHUs on behalf of the district governments. It has been given funds \nunder its contract with the districts to operate the BHUs. It also has the authority to hire and fire \nBHU health workers. NCHD provides additional services specified in the contract with the \ndistrict governments, including financial resources to top up the regular primary health care \nbudget. \n33.  Both  the  PRSP  and  NCHD  are  classified  as  government-owned  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), associated with the federal government. They operate as independent \nentities to execute the health service management contracts. As there are only two at present, \nand since the other NGOs are smaller and lack scale economies, NCHD and the PRSP have \nbeen entrusted with most of the BHUs that are contracted out. As a result, their selection as \ncontractors is not competitive. Some EDOs, Health see their presence as interference. There is \nan opinion that district governments could manage the district health system more efficiently, if \nthe same administrative power given to these NGOs is given to EDOs. As a result of these \nconcerns, GoPb is planning to improve and institutionalize contracting models in district health \nservice  delivery,  incorporating  lessons  from  a  systematic  third-party  evaluation  of  the  two \nmodels.  \n \n34.   With various vertical programs financed by the federal and provincial governments, and \nthe NGO- and donor-financed programs for MNCH services, service delivery in districts risks \nfragmentation, duplication, and inefficiency in resource use. Although most of the programs at \nleast  keep  EDOs,  Health  informed,  they  have  separate  management  and  reporting \narrangements.  GoPb  has  been  long  aware  of  the  problems,  and  is  keen  on  functionally \nintegrating primary health services at BHU level. ODGHS has been tasked to conceptualize and \noversee the integration process.   \n ", "10  \n3.  Need for Greater and Rationally Allocated Financial Resources and \nEffective Resource Management \n35.  Under-Financing  at  the  National  Level.  Public  health  care  is  financed  through \nbudgetary allocations from three different levels of government: federal, provincial, and district. \nPakistan\u2019s  public  health  care  has  been  persistently  underfinanced.  Its  total  health  care \nexpenditure in 2004 was only 2.2% of GDP, more than 80% of which was private expenditure. \nPer capita government expenditure on health was only $9.4, against a benchmark of about $30 \nrecommended by the World Health Organization for developing countries. It also compares \nunfavorably with neighboring countries such as Sri Lanka ($74.1), Nepal ($18.6), Bangladesh \n($18.1), and India ($15.8).  \n36.  The increase in district governments\u2019 spending responsibilities has not been matched by \nconcurrent revenue autonomy necessary to fulfill this new role. District governments depend on \nthe provincial fiscal transfers for a large part of their revenues through Provincial Finance \nCommission (PFC) awards. District governments typically spend less than $2 per capita on \nhealth  care,  severely  under-financing  primary  and  secondary  health  care.  This  has  led  to \nshortage of drugs and medical supplies across health facilities. For FY2003\u2013FY2007, total \nhealth sector expenditure accounted for 6%\u201313% of district governments\u2019 total regular budget. \nThe health sector\u2019s share in district governments\u2019 recurrent budget ranges from 7%\u201319%, and \n0%\u20137% in the development budget depending on the district. Salaries account for about 60% of \ntotal health expenditures. The HSRP and the tied grants received under the ADB-supported \nPDSSP are sometimes the sole sources of funding for health sector development schemes in \nsome districts. Under the PDSSP, conditional grants are being provided to district governments \nand the tehsil municipal administration to achieve progress toward MDGs related to poverty, \ngender, education, health, and water supply and sanitation. The grants are transferred as part of \nthe PFC award. Seventy percent of the grant is transferred based on population and 30% based \non  the  development  deprivation  index  calculated  based  on  the  Multiple  Indicators  Cluster \nSurvey  data.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  GoPb  and  each  local \ngovernment sets the rules and conditions of the grants. The MOU defines the specific eligibility \ncriteria and access criteria each local government has to meet to receive the grants. It also \nestablishes criteria for the use of funds, including the request that funds be kept in a civil \naccount and that such account and related financial statements be audited annually by the \nDistrict Audit Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan.  \n \n37.  Under-Financing in Punjab. GoPb has substantially increased the budget allocation for \nhealth in recent years. Still, in FY2007, GoPb\u2019s total health care spending was PRs23.5 billion, \nor $4.4 per capita, which is less than half of the national per capita spending. Overall, total \nhealth public spending, including spending at district level, has accounted for only 7%\u20138% of \ntotal  spending,  and  since  FY2005  the  majority  of  funds  is  being  allocated  to  recurrent \nexpenditures. \n38.  Primary and secondary health care has proven to be more pro-poor than tertiary health \ncare. Yet, allocation of GoPb\u2019s health budget in the past used to be heavily tilted toward tertiary \nhealth care. With the introduction of the HSRP, however, 45% of the Health Department\u2019s \nannual  development  program  was  allocated  to  primary  and  secondary  health  services  in \nFY2008. Reforms in this direction need to be sustained through the PMDGP.   \n39.  Inadequate Budget Planning and Execution. Any budget increases have to be based \non sound rationale and priorities set out by the prevailing health policy. Now that GoPb has \ndeveloped and committed itself to attaining MSDS, which define the necessary inputs (physical \n ", "  11\ninvestment  and human resource needs) for primary and  secondary health services, GoPb \nshould be able to prepare medium-term budget for these levels. However, a series of structural \nconstraints prevent rational budget formulation and execution. The Medium-Term Development \nFramework shows little consistency in the projections from one year to the next and there is \nample  variation  in  allocations  to  major  programs  in  the  health  sector  annual  development \nprogram. This points to poor planning of the financing needs and low predictability of financial \nallocations. \n \n40.  The planning and budget preparation processes, both at the provincial and district levels, \nshare common limitations. The recurrent and the development budget process are two separate \nexercises,  with  insufficient  consideration  of  the  links  between  the  two.  The  incremental \napproach  to  budget  preparation  perpetuates  inefficiencies  and  imbalances  in  inputs  and \nresource allocation decisions. Since budget preparation remains at the lower levels of the \ndepartment or district officers, there is a risk that the sight of goals and objectives for the \ndepartment  or  district  governments  can  be  lost  with  incremental  budgeting.  Performance \nmeasurement,  both  physical  and  financial,  is  hampered  by  the  lack  of  an  integrated  and \ninformed budget statement about recurrent and development activities, and by the split between \nthe various development initiatives. The district governments\u2019 allocation of resources among \ncompeting demands is often driven by political choices. \n \n41.  Weak  Financial  Reporting.  The  state  government\u2019s  financial  reporting  does  not \nconform to best practices. Budget execution and expenditure statements do not allow drawing \nreliable, homogenous, and reconciled information at any level. Severe weaknesses also exist at \nthe district governments. The EDO, Health does not receive regular financial statements on \nbudget utilization from the health facilities under its jurisdiction. As a result, the EDO does not \nhave a holistic picture of the use of resources in his district, and cannot measure performance \nagainst planned targets. Therefore, in spite of being the officer in charge of health service \ndelivery across the district, the EDO is unable to manage programs effectively and hold staff \nand facilities responsible for delivery of services. Weak financial reporting undermines resource \nallocation decisions at the time budget estimates are prepared or revised, and prevents rational \nscrutiny of resources utilized in service delivery. \n \n42.  At the provincial level, there is a similar absence of consolidated financial reporting \nshowing  budget  execution  for  the  various  provincial  level  programs  and  sections  in  the \nsecretariat as well as for the district governments. The reliance on prior control for each item of \nexpenditure does not ensure proper budgetary control as this would involve monitoring the \nperformance of a unit or entity, including financial performance, and taking corrective action \nwhere  necessary.  Dual  budgeting  also  restricts  the  scope  for  comprehensive  analysis  of \ngovernment operations and evaluation of their performance. Like the EDO, Health, the secretary \nof health\u2014as the principal accounting officer for the Health Department\u2014has limited access to \nconsolidated financial information to enable proper scrutiny of the performance of subordinate \nofficers, facilities, or spending units, let alone having an overview of overall resource allocation \nand financial performance in the public health sector. \n \n43.  Weak Fiduciary Environment. An organization\u2019s internal control system is defined as \nthe whole network of systems established to provide reasonable assurance that objectives will \nbe achieved in an efficient and economic manner; and that policies, procedures, laws, and \nregulations are complied with. A well-structured and executed internal control system ensures \nthe integrity and reliability of information, accounts, and data; and provides assurance that the \ninstitutions\u2019 assets and interests are protected from losses. The role of internal audit, in turn, is \nbased on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. Any audit \n ", "12  \nwill need to begin by assessing the controls in place and indicating where the controls are failing \nor are inadequate. \n \n44.  In Punjab, the manual of financial rules and regulations, the purchase manual, and other \ndocuments and handbooks define the set of internal controls at provincial and district levels. \nThese consist mainly of ex-ante controls on all non-salary expenditures, ultimately enforced by \nthe district account officer at the district level and Accountant General\u2019s Office at the provincial \nlevel. This effectively limits commitments to cash availability and approved budget allocations, \nand is effective in controlling expenditures. However, as the recent assessment15 noted, while \nthe rules are widely understood, in some cases they may be excessive, cause unnecessary \ndelays, and are generally not adhered to effectively. \n \n45.  Punjab\u2019s internal audit function is not effective. Although a number of key departments \nhave some form of internal audit functions, these are not focused on systems, the reporting is \nirregular, and not all recommendations are acted upon. In district governments, the appointment \nof internal audit staff by district nazims (mayors) has generally not taken place. In the Health \nDepartment, the internal audit function has weakened substantially and is being used in an ad \nhoc manner since devolution. Its role and direction are unclear and its reporting line is to the \nadditional secretary for establishment rather than to the secretary, as it should be given that the \nlatter is the principal accounts officer of the Health Department. The audit wing does not have \nany  systematic  approach  to  audit  planning,  or  formal  processes  for  reporting  to  senior \nmanagement or an audit committee, which would approve the audit plan, review audit reports, \nand ensure follow-up actions. Within the Health Department, there is a clear misconception that \nthe function of the internal audit wing is limited to supporting the department in addressing the \naudit observations raised by the external audit.  \n46.  Alternative Health Financing and Provider Payment. While the increase in budget \nallocation for public health services to implement MSDS is the most urgent need and will be a \nkey focus of the government policy for the next few years, GoPb is also concerned about the \nlong-term  sustainability  and  equity  of  health  care  financing  and  provider  payment  system. \nContinuation of the present budget-supported public health provisions may be an option, if \nadjusted to emerging issues; clearly, this will be inadequate. As the GoPb successfully improves \npublic health services, not only the relative poor, but also wealthier people, may start using \npublic health services heavily. Then, the present model of basically universal free public health \ncare may disproportionately subsidize wealthier people, without a progressive tax scheme in \nplace, and lead to a distorted and highly unsustainable system. To develop an equitable and \nsustainable  health  financing  system,  an  in-depth  assessment,  especially  of  out-of-pocket \nexpenditure,  is  required.  Until  a  holistic  equitable  health  financing  system  is  developed, \nimmediate safety net measures for reducing the poor\u2019s health expenditure burden are needed. \n47.  Public health care is in principle free, except ticket charges ranging from PRe1 to PRs7, \nand user charges for selected diagnostic tests. The user charge system, however, is in a state \nof confusion. Best practice dictates that the resources generated from user charges be kept at \nthe facility level, or at least used for sector financing needs. However, Punjab\u2019s system requires \nthe user charges to be deposited to the provincial general account. The practice widely varies \nacross the province. Some district governments deposit them in their own district accounts, \nsometimes with part of the collected user charges shared with the health staff, while most do not \naccount for them properly. In either case, the user charges were not retained in the health \n                                                 \n15 GoPb, ADB, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, European Commission, and the \nWorld Bank. 2007.

At the outset, the user charges themselves vary across districts, \nwhile they were regulated by the Health Department prior to the 2001 devolution. The user \ncharge system needs to be reviewed, rationalized, and overhauled thoroughly to keep the \ncharges at the health facilities, or at least in the health sector, to mitigate the problem of gross \nunder-financing of the sector.  \n \n48.  Patients often incur additional out-of-pocket expenditures visiting public health facilities \nbecause medicines and medical supplies required for treatments are often missing and have to \nbe purchased from the market by the patients themselves. As a result, childbirth at a public \nhealth facility may cost PRs300\u2013PRs5,000 depending on the case. Out-of-pocket health care \nexpenditures often severely affect the poor. There is some assistance for the poor, mainly \nfinanced by schemes such as the Zakat Fund (Islamic charity) and Baitulmaal. The Zakat Fund \ngives funds to hospitals, which in turn support poor patients. Baitulmaal reimburses claims to \nthose who have applied for assistance and are found to be eligible. Medical superintendents of \npublic hospitals also have discretionary power to exempt up to 25% of the patients from user \ncharges. Both Zakat and Baitulmaal are thinly spread over many categories of assistance, and \napplication  procedures  are  cumbersome.  The  negative  connotation  associated  with  Zakat \nsupport receivers often discourages people from applying. To address these deficiencies in the \nexisting programs, GoPb is reviewing different possibilities of programs targeted at the poor. \nOne  of  them  is  health  cards  targeted  at  poor  pregnant women  and  children, who  will  be \nexempted from health care expenditure up to a certain ceiling.  \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n49.  ADB committed itself to supporting the attainment of MDGs in 2002. Strategy 2020 \nreinforces that commitment. A key premise of Strategy 2020 is inclusive economic growth. It \nencourages  the  region  to  \u201cpromote  greater  access  to  opportunities  by  expanding  human \ncapacities, especially for the disadvantaged, through investments in education, health and basic \nsocial protections.\u201d In terms of the health sector, Strategy 2020 identifies strengthening of public \nexpenditure management for cost-effective delivery of health programs and services as an area \nof ADB\u2019s comparative advantage. In that regard, ADB\u2019s 1999 health sector policy remains \nrelevant.16 The policy stresses the need for ensuring access of the poor, women, and children to \ncost-effective preventive, promotive, and curative health services. ADB\u2019s possible roles include \nhelping developing member countries to strengthen their public sector management capacity, \ndiversify health care financing sources, and adopt innovative approaches and technologies. In \nline with Strategy 2020, the proposed PMDGP will focus on enhancing access, particularly of \nthe poor, to health services.    \n \nD.  Coordination with Other Projects and Programs  \n50.  The design of the PMDGP is based on an evidence-based, technical approach for \nimproving women\u2019s and children\u2019s health. The MSDS were developed based on the World \nHealth Organization standards and other specialist technical agencies. The nature and mix of \ntechnical inputs needed to provide MSDS are well-known and technically feasible, even in \nchallenging  environments.  When  provided  at  sufficient  scale  and  coverage,  international \nexperience shows this approach can rapidly improve health outcomes. More specifically, the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) pilots of some of the key MSDS in three districts of \nPunjab  have  shown  significant  improvements  in  access  and  outcomes.  The  PMDGP  thus \nprovides a good illustration of complementarity and partnership\u2014WHO and UNICEF identifying \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1999.  Policy for the Health Sector. Manila.  \n ", "14  \nproven packages of technical interventions that improve MDGs 4 and 5, but ADB providing the \nlarge-scale  development  finance  not  available  to  these  technical  agencies.  ADB  is  also \nproviding  policy  and  technical  input  on  public  expenditure  management  and  more  rational \nallocation of resources, which complements the advice of technical agencies such as WHO and \nUNICEF. \n51.  PMDGP has been designed in coordination with ADB-financed provincial government \nprograms\u2014PDSSP,  PRMP  and  PGEIP\u2014and  the  MNCH  Program  financed  by  the  federal \ngovernment. Both the PRMP and PDSSP have received significant cofinancing support from the \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom. The PDSSP has \nintroduced  the  district  sector  planning  system  and  developed  minimum  service  delivery \nstandards for the devolved social services including health, education, and water and sanitation \nservices. The PRMP has helped mostly at the provincial level to improve efficiency of service \ndelivery, while the PGEIP is deepening reforms started under the PRMP. One of the most \nimportant contributions of the PRMP is the development of the health sector reform framework \nthat is the launching pad of the HSRP. The PMDGP constitutes an important part of the health \nsector reform initiatives started under the HSRP, and implementation of the health MSDS \ndeveloped  by  the  PDSSP  is  a  core  objective  of  the  PMDGP.  The  development  partners\u2019 \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 5. \nE.  Lessons \n52.  Three generic pointers from past program and projects operations are relevant to this \nProgram: (i) government ownership is crucial; (ii) programs and projects often fail because of \ntheir complexity compared to the capacity of the executing agencies; and (iii) policy matrices are \nfrequently  long,  with  many  conditions,  but  tend  to  lack  linkages  between  conditions  and \nexpected  impacts.17 The  social  action  program,  which  helped  the  Government  put  long-\nneglected primary health services on its political agenda, also revealed that the performance of \nPakistan\u2019s public social sector strongly depended on political will, governance, and funding, \nrather than technical issues. The program\u2019s experience also warns against multisector, multi-\nprovincial programs, and urges for capacity building. Specific to Pakistan, the recent country \nassistance  program  evaluation  presented  similar  lessons,  and  suggested  that  ADB\u2019s \nimplementation capacity has to be strengthened, especially by increasing human resource \nallocations in the resident mission.18 The PMDGP design reflects these lessons. First, it is a \nsingle-province, single-sector program. It has been built on the state government\u2019s health sector \nreform programs, especially to address the priority actions recommended by the health working \ngroup  constituted  by  the  chief  minister  in  April  2008.  The  weak  planning,  budgeting,  and \nimplementation capacity (especially in district governments) is a major bottleneck. To address \nthis, a team of experts will be placed in the Health Department exclusively tasked to capacity \nbuilding  for  district  governments.  The  proposed  policy  conditions  are  directly  linked  to \nimplementation of the MSDS, which directly contributes to the program goals. Pakistan Resident \nMission\u2019s  capacity  has  been  built  up  in  public  resource  management  in  general,  which \nencompasses social service delivery.  \n53.  The  project  completion  report  for  the  Women\u2019s  Health  Project 19  suggested  that \nimproving human resources, increasing health sector financing, and strengthening districts\u2019 \nhealth  management  capacity  are  required.  The  PMDGP  emphasizes  these  three  aspects \naccordingly. Review of previous health sector projects in Pakistan also suggests that delay in \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2001. Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending.

Manila. \n ", "  15\nrecruiting  project  staff,  processing  procurement  documents,  and  lack  of  clarity  in  project \nimplementation arrangements between federal and provincial implementation units was a major \ncause  of  delay  in  project  implementation.  The  proposed  Program  will  avoid  these \nimplementation delays, as the existing program management unit will be responsible for daily \nmanagement of the Program, and the Program focuses on one province. The capacity of the \nexecuting  agency  was  also  a  concern  in  some  projects  and  programs.  The  Program  is \naddressing this by establishing a strategy and planning cell and a financial management cell \n(FMC) in the Health Department, and a team of experts exclusively tasked to do capacity \nbuilding for the district governments.   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n54.   The impact of the PMDGP will be attainment of the MDGs of reducing the IMR and \nMMR in Punjab. The Program\u2019s outcome will be improved access to, and quality and equity of, \nhealth services. The delivery of the minimum package of services stipulated in the MSDS, \nespecially  in  MNCH,  is  the  core  strategy  for  attaining  the  MDGs.  Therefore,  the  Program \nfocuses on reforms required for effective implementation of the MSDS. The Program will assist \nthe GoPb in undertaking health sector reforms to (i) improve the availability and quality of \nprimary  and  secondary  health  services;  (ii) manage  health  service  delivery  better;  and \n(iii) develop a sustainable and pro-poor health care financing system. The development policy \nletter  is  in  Appendix  6.  A  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  1  and  tentative  policy  actions  for \nsubsequent subprograms is in Appendix 7.   \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n1.  Improving the Availability and Quality of Primary and Secondary Health \nServices \n55.   Key actions in this reform area are to introduce institutional arrangements and provide \nadequate and skilled human resource inputs required for effectively delivering the minimum \npackage of MNCH-related services stipulated in the MSDS. \n \n56.  Policy Objective 1-1: MSDS Introduced to Primary and Secondary Health Services. \nThis policy objective aims to introduce public services standards, which should be eventually \nobserved by private practitioners. The MSDS define a set of services to be available at each \nhealth facility, and coverage targets for each service. GoPb has decided that MSDS should be \nenforced in phases, with the first phase comprising MNCH-related standards (Appendix 8). \nDuring subprogram 1, all districts will have agreed to reach the minimum acceptable levels of \nMSDS by 2012, by signing MOUs with the GoPb. The MOU clearly specifies the responsibilities \nof both provincial and district governments. At least seven districts are expected to achieve \nMNCH-related MSDS in 2009, and a total of 15 in 2010, with others complying prior by 2012. \n57.  MSDS  implementation  guidelines  that  spell  out  technical  and  financial  resources \navailable for district governments and steps for planning, implementation, and monitoring are \nprepared by GoPb in consultation with district governments. ODGHS helps district governments \nimprove their MSDS implementation plan, by providing TA. Under subprogram 2, a plan for \nachieving  MSDS  will  be  included  in  the  districts\u2019  3-year  rolling  plans,  which  have  been \nintroduced  under  the  PDSSP.  The  planning  format  will  be  improved  to  cover  the  MSDS \nimplementation  plan,  including  the  situation  analysis,  problem  identification,  and  strategic \n ", "16  \npriority actions required for attaining MSDS, and a detailed financing plan for the necessary \nactions. 20 The various sources of funds will be integrated into a comprehensive financing plan. \nAs the MSDS have defined the services that the public are entitled to, it is important to ensure \nthat the public is aware of the MSDS. Further, the public have an important role in making the \nhealth system accountable. District governments will disseminate MSDS to health facilities, \nhealth workers, and communities during subprogram 2 and onward through various media. \nDuring subprogram 3, performance of the health sector, especially the district health system, will \nbe evaluated through a third-party assessment of its progress toward attaining MSDS and a \ncitizen satisfaction survey.  \n58.  Policy Objective 1-2: Primary and Secondary Health Services Fully Staffed and \nEquipped according to MSDS. To improve access to MNCH services quickly, GoPb will recruit \nabout 360 additional lady health visitors under subprogram 1 to fill at least 90% of the 400 \nvacant posts. GoPb will also create about 2,500 additional posts for midwives at BHUs, and 150 \nposts for gynecologists at THQs and DHQs under subprogram 1, in accordance with the MSDS. \nUnder subprogram 2, GoPb will create an additional 2,500 posts of lady health visitors, and \nabout 4,000 posts of nurses. By subprogram 2, it is expected that 95% of BHUs will have a \nWMO or alternative arrangement for providing access to competent female staff in the MNCH, \nand 80% of all primary and secondary health facilities will be fully equipped and staffed. During \nsubprogram 3, 100% of primary and secondary health facilities will be fully equipped and staffed. \n59.  GoPb  will  use  part  of  the  program  assistance  to  provide  district  governments  with \nsupplementary funds through conditional grants to implement the MSDS, as explained under \npolicy objective 3, and otherwise use the program funds to support the additional posts for \nhealth  staff  and  equipment  according  to  MSDS  requirements.  GoPb  will  also  strengthen \nODGHS to support district governments in MSDS and other priority areas as agreed with district \ngovernments under policy objective 2.  \n \n60.  Policy Objective 1-3:  Measures Adopted to Improve Quality of Health Workers and \ntheir Practices. The Health Department has recognized that the quality of health workers is the \nmost critical determinant of the quality of health services; and that the paramedics, nurses, \nmidwives, and lady health visitors play an important role in health service delivery. GoPb \ncommits to developing a comprehensive health human resource plan that will cover improved \nservice structures, registration and examination systems, personnel management (including \nrotation  of  staff  in  rural  areas  and  linking  promotion  to  rural  placement),  and  quality \nimprovement of both pre- and in-service training. GoPb pays special attention to paramedics\u2019 \nquality, which has been long-neglected. While GoPb is in control of paramedics\u2019 training, to \nimprove the quality of nurses and medical doctors, GoPb will have to closely work with the \nPakistan Nursing Council, and Pakistan Medical and Dental Council.   \n61.  Improving the quality of health workers\u2019 services requires a range of actions. Poor quality \nof teaching has a long-term impact on the performance of the health system. Improving the \nquality of nurses, lady health visitors, midwives, and dispensers requires urgent upgrading of \ntraining  institutes.  This  will  be  initiated  under  subprogram  1  by  developing  a  conceptual \nframework for upgrading training institutes urgently. At least 50% of the training institutions will \nbe upgraded under subprogram 2, and all training institutions will be upgraded by subprogram 3. \nBoth  short-  and  medium-term  actions  will  be  taken  for  improving  the  quality  of  teaching. \nMoreover, for paramedics, the accreditation system needs to be upgraded.

However, Punjab Medical Faculty\u2019s limited capacity is regarded \nas  a  bottleneck  for  ensuring  quality  of  paramedics.  Under  subprogram  1,  a  new  service \nstructure and regulatory framework for paramedics has been drafted, to be implemented under \nsubprograms 2 and 3. Neither medical doctors nor paramedics have a systematic opportunity or \nincentive to update their knowledge. During subprogram 2, a continuing education system for \nthem will be developed, linked to promotion and/or relicensing.    \n62.  A comprehensive health human resources plan will be developed and approved during \nsubprogram 2. The plan should address both the quality and quantity of health sector human \nresources,  incentives  for  filling  vacancies,  rationalization  of  the  service  structure,  and \ncomputerized registration of health workers.  \n \n63.  Under subprogram 1, the Health Department has approved SMPs, SOPs, and a protocol \nfor referral services, to be implemented under subprograms 2 and 3. Health workers need to be \ntrained on the new SMPs as soon as possible to keep up with the emerging requirements. \nTherefore, during subprogram 1, the training plan has been developed for MNCH-related health \nworkers on SMP, the referral protocols, and SOPs. During subprogram 2, SMP, the referral \nprotocols,  and  SOP  training  for  MNCH-related  workers  should  be  completed.  During \nsubprogram  3,  all  other  health  workers  will  be  trained.  Simultaneously,  more  systematic \nmeasures for regularly updating health workers\u2019 knowledge and skills will be developed and \nimplemented during subprograms 2 and 3. Continued education systems for both doctors and \nparamedics will be established and linked to their promotion or licensing. \n64.  Policy Objective 1-4: MSDS Introduced to the Private Sector. In Punjab, private \nhealth services are not subject to any quality standards and the quality of their services is \nquestionable. Prior to engaging private practitioners in quality assurance activities, there is a \nneed for understanding the situation of both qualified and unqualified private practitioners in \nPunjab. The Health Department plans to take stock of private health service providers and \nanalyze their locations, categories, and qualifications, as the first step during subprogram 1. \nOver subprograms 2 and 3, additional districts are expected to reach the minimum level of \nacceptance for the core MNCH-related MSDS gradually. During subprogram 3, MSDS, SOPs, \nand SMPs will be introduced to private sector practitioners.  \n \n2.  Strengthening the Management of Health Service Delivery \n65.  This reform area will aim to improve the efficiency of the daily management of health \nservice delivery with an initial focus on MNCH, by improving district health management and \nmonitoring, resource management, and developing alternative models of health care delivery. \nThe ODGHS plays an important role in ensuring district governments\u2019 satisfactory performance \nthrough their performance and providing TA.   \n66.  Policy Objective 2-1: Improved Management and Performance Monitoring. ODGHS \nneeds to be restructured and strengthened to support the district governments effectively in \nimproving strategic planning, especially for implementing and attaining MSDS, and day-to-day \nmanagement and monitoring of the district health system. One of the most critical areas that \nrequire improvement is the M&E system. Regular M&E of performance of the district health \nsystem  and  feedback  to  district  governments  on  their  health  service  will  introduce  more \noutcome-based service delivery.  \n \n ", "18  \n67.  During subprogram 1, ODGHS will have been reorganized and strengthened to be the \nmain source of TA, and reliable and comprehensive health information. It will analyze the \nperformance of the district health system, especially in view of MSDS, and regularly publish \nreports  on  the  district\u2019s  health  situation  and  district  governments\u2019  performance.  Further,  a \ncapacity  development  plan  for  the  district  health  management  team  will  also  have  been \ndeveloped  (Appendix  9).  Based  on  monitoring  of  the  district  governments\u2019  progress  in \nimplementing MSDS, ODGHS will recast each district government\u2019s capacity and adjust the \ncapacity development and provide TA for each district government accordingly.  \n68.  To improve performance monitoring, under subprogram 1 an M&E policy framework will \nhave  been  developed.  The  framework  should  clearly  highlight  the  scope  and  emphasize \nharmonization of various sources of information, the frequency of health information, and the \nuse of such information for decision making. The DHIS should be introduced in 10 districts \nduring subprogram 1, and rolled out to all the 35 districts during subprogram 2. Technical inputs \nshould be provided to district governments by ODGHS to enable them to use the information \ncontent of the DHIS effectively and produce quarterly reports.  \n69.  Policy Objective 2-2: Improved Efficiency of Drug and Supply Procurement. The \nprocurement of drugs and medicines is an essential component of the quality of health service \ndelivery. At present, the system of procuring drugs and medicines by the district governments is \nin a state of flux. Under subprogram 1, the Health Department has conducted a comprehensive \nreview  of  drug,  equipment  and  supply  management  systems  in  consultation  with  district \ngovernments;  and  identified  different  options  for  improving  the  procurement  system  in  its \nefficiency, cost-effectiveness, and transparency. During subprogram 2, the Health Department \nwill clarify its own responsibilities as well as those of the district governments in the process of \nprocurement of drugs, equipment, and supplies by issuing sector-specific guidelines based on \nthe  comprehensive  review.  Improvements  in  the  procurement  process  have  to  be  further \nsupported by the introduction of a comprehensive monitoring mechanism of the availability of \ndrugs,  equipment,  and  supplies  at  each  health  facility  by  subprogram  2.  All  primary  and \nsecondary  health  facilities  should  have  regular  supply  of  appropriate  essential  drugs  by \nsubprogram 2. Information on drug availability is included in the DHIS. Moreover, the EDO, \nHealth will be responsible for submitting periodic reports to the Health Department on utilization \nof the procurement budget and of drugs and medicines to support future rounds of procurement. \nDuring subprogram 3, the Health Department\u2019s procurement system will be further improved \nthrough adoption of health technology assessment tools.  \n \n70.  Policy Objective 2-3: Alternative Models of Health Service Delivery Examined and \nInstitutionalized. Contracting of health services, or health service management, could help \nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of health service delivery, as shown in other countries. \nPunjab has in the past tried two models of contracting, one with the PRSP and the other with \nNCHD (discussed in para. 32). GoPb wants to determine whether or not the contracting model \nhas produced better health outcomes and/or efficiency and effectiveness of health services in \nthe districts compared to those that did not contract services, and if yes, what kind of contracting \nmodel is suitable for Punjab. Therefore, during subprogram 1, GoPb has started a third-party \nevaluation of the PRSP and NCHD models. During subprogram 2, based on the evaluation \nresults,  the  GoPb  will  determine  a  suitable  model  of  contracting,  and  encourage  district \ngovernments to contract entire or part of health services, according to their needs. GoPb has \nfinalized the concept on the functional integration of various health services financed by different \ntiers of the government at BHUs for their better coordination and efficiency during subprogram 1, \nand pilot test the model during subprogram 2. Based on the results of the pilot test, the concept \nwill be adjusted and expanded to all districts during subprogram 3.  \n ", "  19\n3.  Establishing Sustainable Pro-Poor Health Financing Arrangements  \n71.  Public  health  care  has  been  underfinanced  in  Punjab.  GoPb  should  substantially \nincrease the health care budget to be able to finance the minimum package of health services, \nand simultaneously improve the targeting of public health financing and efficiency of funds. This \nreform area addresses the need for pro-poor health care financing and improving the efficiency \nof limited resources. \n \n72.  Policy Objective 3-1: Greater Provision and More Rational Budget Allocation for \nthe Health Sector, especially for Primary and Secondary Health Services. Attaining the \nMDGs  relating  to  the  IMR  and  MMR  requires  a  substantial  increase  in  public  health \nexpenditures. It is equally important that the increased public resources are allocated more \nrationally to those key gaps and bottlenecks in the system. This requires effective medium-term \nstrategic  planning  at  both  district  government  and  Health  Department  levels,  especially  to \nensure that the MNCH-related MSDS are met. The capacity for such planning is very limited \nwithin the health sector in Punjab. Therefore, reforms in planning and budgeting are prioritized \nduring subprogram 1 to develop an action plan that prioritizes the implementation of MNCH-\nrelated MSDS and seek budgets according to the plan. \n \n73.  Under subprogram 1, the Health Department will ensure that the strategy and policy unit \nset up under the PGEIP will be fully staffed and its capacity built to provide policy directions. \nA comprehensive policy framework will also be defined for the health sector. In addition, a \nmedium-term financing plan that clearly includes the cost of ensuring compliance with the \nMSDS will be developed. This will represent the starting point for development of a more \ncomprehensive medium-term expenditure framework for the health sector under subprogram 2. \nGoPb has increased actual spending in the health sector during FY2009 by 15% in accordance \nwith the MTEF projection. \n74.  The low revenue autonomy of district governments suggests that any additional funding \nneeds arising from MSDS implementation will have to be met by increased provincial transfers. \nAlthough  the  non-matching,  non-conditional  structure  of  the  PFC  award  promotes  district \ngovernments\u2019 ability to allocate resources autonomously, there is no way to ensure that districts\u2019 \nspending  decisions  target  provincial  policy  priorities.21 Therefore,  under  subprogram  1,  the \nFinance  Department  and  the  Health  Department  will  have  devised  a  conditional  grant \nmechanism,22 and will channel an additional PRs3.5 billion to district governments through the \nmechanism  earmarked  for  implementing  the  MNCH-related  MSDS  and  selected  health \ninterventions for FY2009.    \n \n75.  The conditional grant mechanism will be regulated by a set of conditions divided into two \ncategories: (i) minimum conditions, which will define the eligibility of each district government to \nenter the scheme and receive a base allocation; and (ii) a set of performance indicators, which \nwill entitle district governments to an additional allocation based on their ability to meet each \nperformance indicator. Fifty percent of the total pool of resources will be set aside as a base \nallocation and the remaining half will be allocated on the basis of the performance indicators. \nThe base allocation will be distributed among districts in accordance with a formula that takes \n                                                 \n21 The PFC award was introduced by the PLGO and is the main tool of fiscal equalization in Pakistan. The Provincial \nFinance Commission is the entity in charge of defining the formula for allocation of the provincial allocable amount \namong district governments. Each award has a validity of 3 years, and in Punjab the first award has covered the \nperiod up to FY2009.  \n22 The PLGO establishes that conditional grants can be given to the district governments. The amount is based on \nconditions agreed between the provincial and district governments under the Program. \n ", "20  \ninto account their development needs (poverty incidence and health indicators) and size. The \nperformance component will kick in from FY2010 onwards. Ten percent of the base allocation \nwill have to be used for capacity-building purposes. The minimum conditions should include \n(i) preparation of a quality health sector plan, including a budgeted action plan for implementing \nthe  MNCH-related  MSDS;  (ii)  evidence  of  the  district  government\u2019s  actual  health  sector \nexpenditure  corresponding  to  the  plan,  both  in  terms  of  size  and  expenditure  items;  and \n(iii) evidence that the conditional grants are additional to the district governments\u2019 regular health \nbudget\u2014the district governments should increase the regular health budget in real terms. The \nperformance indicators should be directly linked to MSDS, and easy to measure. The evaluation \nof district governments\u2019 performance will take into account the differences in initial conditions. \nThe Health Department, through ODGHS, will ensure the quality of district governments\u2019 plans \nand monitor the performance of district governments in terms of health outputs and outcomes. \nThe  Finance  Department  will  monitor  the  accounts  of  the  conditional  grants  at  district \ngovernments. \n76.  Under  subprogram  2,  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  fund  flows  to  the  health  sector, \nconditional grants earmarked for the health sector will be incorporated in the next PFC award for \nFY2010\u2013FY2012. Effective use of the conditional grants, however, relies on the presence of a \nrobust monitoring mechanism, which makes district governments accountable for the use of the \ngrants. District governments will be required to submit quarterly progress reports to the Health \nDepartment for monitoring execution of the health budget.  \n \n77.  Policy Objective 3-2: Improved financial Management and Reporting in the Health \nSector. Under subprogram 1, the Health Department has decided to merge the development \nwing and the budget and accounts wing into an FMC tasked to drive financial management \nreforms in the Health Department and its spending agencies, and for collecting budget and \nexpenditure information from districts (Appendix 10). The FMC will be the focal point in the \nHealth Department for the Finance Department and Planning and Development Department for \nbudget preparation. The FMC will be responsible for coordinating the budget preparation and \nexecution process and ensuring adherence to the budget preparation principles. The FMC will \nbe central to financial reporting in the health sector, and will be able to generate management \naccounting information to facilitate budgetary control and achievement against policy goals. It \nwill liaise with the internal audit wing to review internal control mechanisms in the Health \nDepartment and its spending agencies. Under subprogram 1, the Finance Department will \nfacilitate  improved  budget  preparation  by  publishing  the  revised  budget  manual  and \ndisseminating it to all line departments. \n \n78.  The FMC will be the nucleus of financial information in the sector, with reporting streams \nestablished between itself and all districts, autonomous bodies, subdepartments in the Health \nDepartment, the drug test laboratory, and ODGHS. Statements of expenditure, in an agreed \nformat based on the new accounting model chart of accounts and classifications developed \nunder  the  World  Bank-supported  Project  for  Improved  Financial  Reporting  and  Accounting \n(PIFRA), will be collected on a monthly basis for all provincially funded units and on a quarterly \nbasis from districts. Consolidation could be done on a simple database or preferably on the \naccounting module of the PIFRA system, and monthly management accounts produced for the \nsecretary and senior management of the Health Department. Reconciliation with the Accountant \nGeneral\u2019s Office will be required. During subprogram 2 and 3, as the FMC gets up to full \nstrength, district reporting will also be monthly and will be based on accounting information, \nwhich is fully reconciled at the district account officer\u2019s office.  \n \n ", "  21\n79.  Under subprogram 1, the Finance Department has agreed to prioritize implementation of \nthe budget module of the PIFRA interface in the Health Department. A range of supporting \nactivities for this will include the provision of comprehensive staff training in the system, the \nestablishment and staffing of a SAP (PIFRA software) competency center in Lahore and other \ntraining to ensure linkages with MTEF requirements, and rollout of the PIFRA system at district \nlevel. \n \n80.  The PIFRA SAP 3 system has been used for 2 financial years in Punjab and has been \nextended to all 35 district account officer offices. The classification codes, drafted as part of \nPIFRA reforms nationally, are fixed at the functional code level but can be adjusted via the \nnational code control committee. Under subprogram 2, the classification codes for financial \nreporting in the health sector will be modified to better reflect the health sector core areas of \nactivity in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care; research and development; and medical \neducation. This will become important as the MTEF is strengthened.  \n \n81.  Policy Objective 3-3: Improved Internal Controls and Audit in the Health Sector. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Health  Department  analyzes  the  effectiveness  and  adequacy  of \ninternal controls based on audit observations, and prepares a conceptual framework on how to \nimprove the internal controls. Periodic meetings of the departmental accounts committees will \nbe convened by the secretary of health to reduce the backlog in audit observations raised by the \nexternal auditor in a timely manner. The Health Department will have satisfactorily responded to \nat least 1,000 audit observations during subprogram 1. \n \n82.  Under subprogram 2, the Health Department will fill the director and deputy director \nposts in the internal audit wing and ensure that the latter remains fully staffed. An audit plan for \nthe wing will be prepared and submitted to the secretary of health. A timetable and format for \ninternal  audit  reports,  a  plan  for  the  audit  committee  to  review  these  reports  and  take \nmanagement action as required will be prepared. The deepening of internal audit reforms will be \nbased on effective auditing of entities in accordance with the audit plan, and more importantly, \nthe evidence of follow-up action by the secretary of health where needed. This will be required \nin a situation where audit recommendations and objections are raised, but no follow-up action is \ntaken  by  the  auditor.  By  setting  examples  and  demonstrating  the  seriousness  of  senior \nmanagement to improving internal control, the secretary, as principal accounting officer, will \nensure that a virtuous circle of improvement occurs in internal controls, with more efficient \noperating conditions and better functioning of the management. \n \n83.  Under subprogram 2, the Finance Department will prepare and approve detailed job \ndescriptions and terms of service for district governments\u2019 internal auditors,23 along with an \ninternal  audit  manual.  The  internal  audit  function  of  the  district  governments  will  also  be \nstrengthened, as district governments will have appointed internal auditors who will develop \naudit plans, reporting channels to the district coordination officer, and local audit committees \nevidenced by regular meetings and follow-up actions.  \n \n                                                 \n23 The lack of regulations on the terms of service for internal auditors of district governments is a serious obstacle for \neffective functioning of the internal audit function, and is a key aspect to be dealt with under this policy action. \nDistrict governments do not have a cadre of civil servants and this impairs the district nazim\u2019s ability to appoint an \ninternal auditor. A decision has to be taken regarding whether the internal auditors will be from the accounting and \nbudgeting cadre of the provincial government or seconded from the Auditor General\u2019s Office of Pakistan. Training \nof internal auditors also deserves the serious attention of the Finance Department, which can be addressed \nthrough the TA support provided by the PDSSP.   \n ", "22  \n84.  Policy Objective 3-4: A Pro-Poor Health Financing System Developed. GoPb is \ncommitted to increasing public health expenditure in primary and secondary health services, \nwhich are proven to be more pro-poor than in tertiary health care. The conditional grants \nintroduced with PMDGP support will also be distributed among districts through a formula taking \ninto account poverty incidence. In addition to targeting the public resources in a pro-poor \nmanner  through  these  measures,  GoPb  will  have  employed  two  additional  approaches  to \nprovide equitable health services: (i) health expenditure subsidy programs targeted at the poor, \nand (ii) an equitable health financing system. An immediate need is to develop a mechanism to \nrelieve poor women and children from the burden of high health expenditures. Under policy \nobjective  1,  the  state  government  will  have  made  quality  health  services  available  to  its \npopulation.  However,  the  poor  may  not  access  the  services  because  of  economic \nconsiderations. During subprogram 1, GoPb has started studies on user charges and out-of-\npocket expenditures to collect data required for designing the programs targeted at the poor, \nand preparing possible models to be pilot tested. During subprogram 2, the selected models will \nbe pilot tested and successful ones will have been expanded to cover at least 50% of the \ntargeted population during subprogram 3.  \n \n85.  Development of a long-term health financing and provider payment system requires \ncareful  examination  of  different  options  and  implications,  and  consultations  with  the \nstakeholders. It has been agreed that a working group comprising individuals with expertise in \nfinance,  public  health  services,  and  private  health  services  will  be  constituted  to  examine \ndifferent  models,  calculate  financial  implications,  and  write  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the \nsteering committee that will make the final decision. During subprogram 1, a working group has \nbeen constituted comprising representatives of the Planning and Development Department, \nFinance  Department,  Health  Department,  private  health  care  providers,  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders; and an action plan has been agreed. During subprogram 2, initial policy directions \nregarding health care financing and provider payment should be determined, and a capacity-\nbuilding plan and budget for it should be included in the provincial budget. During subprogram 3, \nnecessary  regulatory  frameworks  for  the  new  health  care  financing  and  provider  payment \nsystem will be adopted.    \nC.  Important Features \n86.  The PMDGP has two pillars: (i) improving the quality and availability of health services, \nand (ii) improving public financial management within the health sector. ADB has extensive \nexperience  in  financing  reforms  in  the  health  sector  and  public  financial  management.  By \ncombining both areas in one program, the PMDGP will help GoPb achieve MDGs by making \nmore effective use of available resources. For ADB\u2019s developing member countries, attaining \nMDGs is as much a problem of technical constraints as that of managing limited resources. \n \n87.  The PMDGP marks the Health Department\u2019s major priority shifts from quantity to quality \nof health care, from fragmented to consolidated health service, and from tertiary to primary and \nsecondary health care. Building on GoPb\u2019s health sector reform framework, which has covered \na wide range of activities, the PMDGP will help prioritize actions around the MSDS, and give \nfinancial means to implement them. The PMDGP will integrate different levels of health care \nthrough  the  referral  system;  different  levels  of  planning  and  financing  exercises  through \nstreamlined budgeting and reporting mechanisms; and institutional reforms through FMC and \nstrategy and policy unit, and the Health Department and EDOs. \n88.  The PMDGP will help GoPb institutionalize contracting of health services delivery or \nmanagement  to  other  organizations,  based  on  the  evaluation  of  pilots  in  Punjab.  This  is \n ", "  23\nexpected to improve the efficiency of health service delivery, and make the services flexible by \nremoving bureaucratic rigidities. Contracting has been successfully tried out in Cambodia and \nBangladesh with ADB\u2019s financial support, but has not been expanded to other countries on a \nlarge scale yet.   \nD.  Financing Plan \n89.  The PMDGP adopts a program cluster loan approach consisting of three subprograms, \neach  supported  by  a  single-tranche  loan.  Intervals  of  about  1.0\u20131.5  years  are  envisaged \nbetween the subprograms. Subject to satisfactory progress and approval of subprogram 1 in \nOctober 2008, subprogram 2 could be considered in December 2009, and subprogram 3 in \nDecember 2010.  \n \n90.  The reform agenda for subprogram 2, and especially subprogram 3, will be refined \nbased on progress made and emerging needs. GoPb has requested that financing support for \nsubprograms 2 and 3 be about $200 million\u2013$300 million in total, in view of the large resource \nrequirements until alternative financing modalities take hold and mature. The amount for each \ntranche will be reconfirmed during the PMDGP review and processing of each subprogram. \n \n91.  For subprogram 1, it is proposed that ADB support GoPb\u2019s reforms under the PMDGP \nwith a loan of $100 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan size for \nsubprogram 1 and the indicative financing requirements for subprograms 2 and 3 are based on \nthe following factors: \n \n\u2022  Maintaining basic health services for the poor and mitigating the financial crisis impact: \nRs.13 billion ($162 million) for July 2008-June 2009 \n\u2022  Roll out of MSDS24 in the health sector: Rs.34 billion ($425 million) for the next three \nfiscal years \n\u2022  Scaling up of per capita public health expenditures by at least 40% per year for the next \nyears allowing Punjab to raise per capita spending to about half of the international \nbenchmark set by WHO, or to about $16, by FY2011: this will require a tripling of public \nhealth expenditures from $431 million in FY2009 to $1.36 billion in FY201125    \n \n92.  Under  subprogram  1,  GoPb  will  allocate  PRs3.5  billion  (in  counterpart  funds)  as \nconditional grants to district governments to carry out the reforms associated with the program \n(see para.97). This is based on a careful assessment of the district health systems\u2019 absorption \ncapacity given that a substantial part of an expected tranche release under the PDSSP will be \ntransferred to districts earmarked for social service delivery and resources have been allocated \nfor district governments under the federal MNCH program.  \n \n93.  The loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. \nThe Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan will relend \nthe local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan to GoPb. The terms and conditions \nwill be the same as those extended by ADB to the Borrower.   \n                                                 \n24 Out of this, MNCH-related MSDS will cost Punjab about PRs7 billion for the next three years. \n25 These figures are obtained from the current and projected per-capita expenditures, net of the cost of MSDS \nimplementation. For FY2009, the total health budget requirement at the provincial and district levels is $573 million \nin total, including $142 million for MSDS implementation (which is computed as an average of the 3-year projected \nrequirements). \n ", "24  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management  \n94.  The Health Department will be the Executing Agency for the PMDGP. The program \nmanagement unit for HSRP will be responsible for daily coordination and management. The \nhigh-level program steering committee for HSRP\u2014chaired by chairman of the Planning and \nDevelopment Board, and comprising the secretary of health, secretary of finance, secretary of \nlocal government and community development, and health care providers as members\u2014will \nalso be the program steering committee for the PMDGP and oversee policy decisions. The \nprogram  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  every  6  months.  A  working  group\u2014\ncomprising at least representatives of public and private health providers, Health Department, \nFinance Department, and existing social insurance programs\u2014will be constituted for developing \npro-poor health care financing and provider payment.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n95.  The implementation period for the PMDGP subprogram 1 is from January to October \n2008. The indicative implementation period for subprogram 2 is November 2008\u2013November \n2009; and for subprogram 3, January 2010\u2013December 2010.  \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n96.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the \nitems specified in a negative list of ineligible items (and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources). The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 11. The proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as the Borrower. No supporting import \ndocumentation will be required if, during each year that the loan proceeds are expected to be \ndisbursed, the value of Pakistan\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  that  year.  The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will be made \nunder the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n4.  Release of Program Proceeds and Counterpart Financing \n97.  The subprogram 1 loan of $100 million equivalent will be released in a single tranche \nupon loan effectiveness, and satisfactory completion of all subprogram 1 actions in the policy \nmatrix. The federal government will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated \nby  the  loan  will  be  used  as  additional  resources  to  provincial  financial  resources  already \nallocated for primary and secondary health care; PRs3.5 billion of these counterpart funds will \nbe specifically allocated to district governments as conditional grants for the health sector. GoPb \nwill certify the use of counterpart funds through audited statements acceptable to ADB. \n5.  Anticorruption, Fiduciary Issues, Accounting and Auditing \n98.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \n ", "  25\nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. The policy actions under the PMDGP will mitigate \nthe corruption risks in the health sector. Policy objectives 3-2 and 3-3 are especially meant to \nstrengthen  financial  reporting  and  internal  control  of  the  Health  Department  and  district \ngovernments.   \n99.  The Program\u2019s emphasis on improving internal controls and internal audit at both the \nHealth Department and district government levels will improve transparency and accountability \nin the use of public resources and ensure that fund leakage is minimized. Furthermore, the use \nof the conditional grant mechanism for the transfer of funds to district governments will ensure \nthat money is used effectively to achieve the MNCH-related MSDS and is not diverted to \nalternative uses, for which a built-in performance monitoring mechanism consisting of various \nmonitoring tools will be instituted. Under subprogram 2, the information and communication \ncampaign to be undertaken by district governments on the MSDS will help in raising community \nawareness on the minimum level of service delivery, thus enabling civil society to scrutinize the \nperformance of public health facilities. The Program will also support disclosure of information \non achievement of MNCH-related MDGs and MSDS. \n6.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n100.  The  Health  Department,  through  ODGHS,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and \nanalyzing  progress  in  attaining  health  MDGs  and  related  indicators  that  include  PMDGP \noutcome  indicators.  An  M&E  framework  that  harmonizes  different  sources  of  information \nregularly  collected  by  different  levels  of  the  government  and  different  programs  will  be \ndeveloped, and DHIS data will be regularly analyzed and published. The baseline of the MMR \nand IMR will be established based on the Multi-Indicators Cluster Survey conducted by the \nBureau of Statistics in 2007\u20132008. GoPb will conduct a repeated Multi Indicators Cluster Survey \non  the  IMR  and  MMR  in  2011\u20132012  to  examine  progress  in  attaining  MDG  goals.  The \navailability  of  drugs  and  human  resources  will  be  regularly  monitored  by  EDOs,  Health; \nproblems will be tackled at the district level, and if necessary, by the Health Department. In \naddition, the program management unit for the PMDGP will regularly monitor primary and \nsecondary health facilities through the chief minister\u2019s army.  \n101.  GoPb has been regularly reporting the proportion of births attended by skilled birth \nattendants and immunization coverage, which have a direct impact on the IMR and MMR, in \naddition to the IMR and MMR themselves. The percentage of deliveries at health facilities with \nthe assistance of skilled birth attendants will be added to the report. Most maternal deaths occur \nduring labor, delivery, or within 24 hours of delivery. Most complications are difficult to predict or \nprevent,  and  diagnosis  of  these  complications  and  appropriate  interventions  require \nconsiderable skills and timely access to a referral level facility, which skilled birth attendants \ncannot provide in time if at home. \n102.   GoPb and ADB will periodically review progress in implementation and assess the \nimpact of the PMDGP. GoPb will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with \nother multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for the PMDGP implementation, \nand will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. A \nprogress review will be conducted by the steering committee every quarter, and the Health \nDepartment will submit to ADB detailed quarterly reports, which will include the minutes of the \nreviews. The first progress report will be due within 3 months of loan effectiveness.   \n ", "26  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n103.  Improved  Access  and  Quality  of  Primary  and  Secondary  Health  Services.  By \nhelping Punjab attain the health MDGs, the proposed Program will have potentially helped the \nprovince save at least 11,000 women\u2019s lives and 235,000 infants\u2019 lives by 2015 compared to the \nscenario without program support, assuming that the two health MDGs are fully met within that \ntime frame. By helping all 35 district governments endorse and implement MSDS, the Program \nwill ensure that minimum acceptable levels of service delivery standards are followed across the \nentire province. The adoption of guidelines for MSDS implementation and the requirement for \ndistrict governments to develop a time-bound and fully-costed implementation plan will help \nminimize slippages in the introduction of the minimum standards. Sufficient and capable human \nresources are an essential determinant of service quality. The proposed Program will improve \nthe capacity of the Health Department and district governments to plan their human resource \nneeds, and more importantly will support continued education of medical staff. Finally, progress \ntoward introduction of a quality assurance mechanism for private health care providers will \nensure a safe and uniform standard of services across the province. By ensuring primary and \nsecondary health services to meet MSDS, the Program is expected to have a positive impact on \nMDG6 on HIV/AIDS. MSDS includes HIV preventive measures.  \n104.  Poverty Reduction. Poor people have the worst health outcomes. They are pushed \nfurther into poverty because of ill health, resulting in lower productivity or loss of daily wages, \nand a burden of high health care expenditures. Although public health care is in principle free, \npatients often have to pay substantial amounts for health care because of missing drugs and \nsupplies at public health facilities. The cost of care at private facilities is even more expensive. \nBy making quality and affordable care available at public facilities through a targeted program, \nand the development of an equitable health financing system, the proposed Program will reduce \nthe  health  care  expenditure  burden  and  the  risks  of  falling  seriously  ill  by  giving  timely \ninterventions. By ensuring increased allocations to primary and secondary health care, and \ndistributing the conditional grants among districts through a formula that takes into account \npoverty incidence, the Program will make public finances more pro-poor. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n105.  Improved Management of Health Services. Timely availability of drugs and medicines \nin all health facilities is an essential aspect of health service delivery. The Program will support \nstreamlining of the drug procurement process and will help the Government institutionalize \nalternative mechanisms for service delivery by building on lessons from experience.  \n106.  Economic  Impact. Improved public financial management in the health sector and \nbetter strategic planning skills in the Health Department will contribute to increased value for \nmoney of public spending. Provision of conditional grants to district governments for MDG-\nrelated interventions will ease district governments\u2019 resource constraints while ensuring that \nessential service delivery priorities are protected from expenditure cuts. The increased access \nand quality of public health services will also have a direct poverty-reducing impact by lowering \nthe burden of health expenditures on the poor.  \n107.  Institutional Impact. The health sector in Punjab is in dire need of institutional reforms. \nStrengthening of the strategy and policy unit within the Health Department will ensure that \npolicies and strategies are properly defined, corresponding actions planned, and resources \nallocated  accordingly.  Creation  of  the  FMC  and  related  capacity-building  interventions  will \n ", "  27\nensure that the budget preparation and execution process is owned at the managerial level and \nthat strategic decisions are based on realistic information through adequate reporting on the use \nof financial resources across the health sector. Revitalization of the internal audit wing and of \nthe  departmental  account  committees  in  the  Health  Department,  and  appointing  internal \nauditors at district governments, will enhance the effectiveness of internal controls and increase \naccountability for the use of public funds. Simultaneously, ODGHS will be restructured and \ngiven capacity-building support to give technical guidance to and monitor the performance of \nhealth service delivery by district governments.    \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n108.  Political Risks. There is strong commitment at both political and bureaucratic levels in \nPunjab to improving the living standards of the poor. To this purpose, GoPb has accorded high \npriority to investments in social sectors, particularly health and education. The FY2009 recurrent \nand development budget allocations to the health sector have substantially increased (+53% \nrecurrent and +38% development). Although commitment to the broad direction of reforms is \nensured, the future of the local government system under the new political setup may be at risk \nas  provincial  governments  across  Pakistan  are  exploring  options  to  revisit  intra-provincial \nadministrative and fiscal relationships within the current local government system. While a total \nreversal of the 2001 PLGO is unlikely, changes in the current distribution of power and authority \nacross levels of government may occur. The flexibility built into the single tranche operations is \nwell-suited to addressing the uncertainty surrounding the local government setup, and reform \nactions may be adjusted under subprogram 2. However, if the change in the PLGO leads to \nseparation of primary and secondary health services financing and administrative management, \nthe negative effect of the separation (i.e., further fragmentation of the health services) would be \nvery difficult to contain. ADB should dialogue closely with GoPb to avoid such fragmentation.  \n109.  Governance Risks. There are several governance risks in the areas of public financial \nmanagement, expenditure planning and control, procurement, and corruption. As a policy and \ninstitutional reform program, the PMDGP deliberately and explicitly puts governance and public \nexpenditure management issues at the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the \nPMDGP will positively affect the current institutional setup in the health sector and address \nthese  governance  risks.  The  change  in  public  financial  management  practices  and  the \nemphasis on results-based allocation of resources is likely to encounter resistance from middle-\nmanagement  officials  who  have  vested  interests  in  perpetuating  the  situation.  The  strong \ncommitment  to  reform  at  the  highest  political  and  bureaucratic  level  within  the  Health \nDepartment will help mitigate this risk. In addition, internal and external performance M&E, and \npublicizing the performance are expected to change the situation gradually. The PMDGP has \nbuilt-in third-party assessments, including a citizen satisfaction survey, as policy conditions.  \nC.  Implementation Risks  \n110.  Capacity Risks. The success of the PMDGP is premised on the existence of a cadre of \nqualified and committed health professionals at all levels, and assumes that the proposed \nincentive structures ensure the retention of health professionals, particularly those posted to the \nBHUs. There are risks that the required number of health professionals may not be immediately \navailable  for  the  public  sector.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  GoPb  has  introduced  monetary  and \nnonmonetary  incentives  for  doctors  posted  at  BHUs,  which  have  resulted  in  a  significant \nreduction of vacancies. In addition, the measures of the PMDGP will cascade over time, starting \nwith lower levels and gradually moving up to doctors. At the lower levels, the required number of \nfemale health visitors, for instance, can be mobilized in a relatively short period. The Health \n ", "28  \nDepartment will also develop a dedicated capacity-building plan, and subprograms 2 and 3 will \nprovide resources for implementing the plan.   \n111.  External and Macroeconomic Risks. The recent upsurge in international commodity \nprices is having an adverse impact on Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic indicators. While recurrent \nand development expenditures need to be managed carefully, essential pro-poor investments in \nhealth and education are likely to be preserved at the federal and provincial levels.  Finally, the \npolitical commitment to investments in social sectors will protect pro-poor investments from \nbudget cuts.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION FOR DISBURSEMENT \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n112.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of Pakistan has given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to meet the reform and other financing needs \nrelating  to  implementation  of  the  PMDGP,  including  specific  allocation  of  a \nportion  of  the  counterpart  funds  for  the  conditional  grants  as  described  in \nparas. 74-75 above;  \n(ii)  GoPb will ensure that (a) the objectives achieved, policies adopted, and actions \ntaken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as set forth in the development \npolicy letter, will continue to be in full force and effect for the duration of the \nPMDGP and subsequently; and (b) once achieved, adopted, complied with, and \nimplemented, the objectives, policies, and actions set forth in the development \npolicy letter will continue to be in full force and effect during and subsequent to \nthe PMDGP program period;  \n(iii)  GoPb  will  allocate  a  total  of  PRs3.5  billion  in  conditional  grants,  to  district \ngovernments for FY2009 to support the health sector component, in addition to \nthe regular PFC awards;  \n(iv)  GoPb will ensure that the conditional grants will be disbursed by its Finance \nDepartment to district governments within 1 month from the date each such \ndistrict government has satisfied the minimum conditions;  \n(v)  GoPb will ensure that primary and secondary health services continue to be \nintegrated and are operating as one coherent health system; \n(vi)  GoPb  will  ensure  that  the  conditional  grant  will  be  in  addition  to  district \ngovernments\u2019 regular health budget, and used for implementing MNCH related \nMSDS  and  other  selected  activities  agreed  between  GoPb  and  district \ngovernments,  including  a  minimum  of  10%  of  the  base  conditional  grants \nallocation for capacity building activities;  \n(vii)  GoPb,  through  the  Health  Department,  will  ensure  that  the  existing  policy \nguidelines on transfers and tenure are adhered to in order to ensure appropriate \njob tenure and effective implementation of the Program; and \n ", "  29\n(viii)  GoPb will ensure that the PMDGP will be carried out in accordance with the \nenvironmental  rules  and  regulations  applicable  in  Pakistan  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  GoPb  will  ensure  implementation  of  any \nenvironmental monitoring and mitigation measures, including development and \nimplementation of any service standards and operating procedures for disposal \nof hazardous and medical waste. \n \nB.

The Government is a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and is \nfully committed to achieving them. However, progress toward achieving the MDGs in Pakistan is \nfar from satisfactory. While there had been claims of poverty reduction, economic growth, and \nimprovement in gross domestic product (real growth rate1 rose from 4.5% in 2003 to 6.6% in \n2007), no corresponding impact is visible on reducing maternal and child mortality. For example, \nthe infant mortality rate (IMR) was 77 per 1,000 live births in 2000-2001 and 78 per 1,000 live \nbirths in 2006\u20132007. Pakistan\u2019s IMR and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) are the highest in \nSouth Asia, population growth rate is the highest, and contraceptive availability the lowest. High \npopulation growth will increase pressure on the already weak public health service delivery \nsystem.  \n2.  As Pakistan, including Punjab, is going through an epidemiological and demographic \ntransition, it is still facing a challenge of burden of pre-transitional communicable diseases, while \nthe  prevalence  of  noncommunicable  and  chronic  illnesses  is  emerging  as  an  additional \nchallenge for the already compromised health service delivery system. Coupled with prevailing \nilliteracy,  poverty,  and  low  status of  women  in  society,  this  is  hampering  progress  toward \nachieving the MDGs related to maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH). Development \nefforts are further threatened because of political instability, extremism, and violence. \n3.  Punjab health sector analysis shows that it is unlikely to achieve the MDGs unless the \nhealth sector is effectively reformed to make good quality MNCH services accessible to the \nmasses in Punjab. To bridge urban\u2013rural inequity in coverage, more allocation will be required \nfor services in rural areas along with enhanced efficiency and institutional capacity to deliver \ngood quality services. Furthermore, to achieve the MDG related to MMR (MDG5), a significant \npolicy shift will be required to encourage institutional delivery to ensure that all required care can \nbe offered including emergency obstetric care. \n1.  Current Status of Health MDGs \n4.  Child  Mortality  (MDG4). In Punjab, the under-five mortality rate is recorded to be \n112 per 1,000 live births (2003\u20132004). There is significant regional disparity, with a lower rate \n(75 per 1,000 live births) in major urban cities and a higher rate (119 per 1,000 live births) in \nrural Punjab\u2014against the MDG target of 52 per 1,000 live births by 2015. The IMR in Punjab \nwas 115 in 1996\u20131997 and has been reduced to 77 per 1,000 live births in 2003\u20132004.2 It is \nmuch higher in rural areas (82 per 1,000 live births) than major urban cities (55 per 1,000 live \nbirths). Districts located in northern Punjab close to the provincial capital report lower IMR \ncompared to districts in the south. The significant urban\u2013rural disparity shows inequity in service \ndistribution and access to basic health services in Punjab.  \n5.  More than half of the under-five deaths and 70% of infant deaths occur during the \nneonatal period caused by sepsis, asphyxia, preterm births, and neonatal tetanus.3 The causes \n                                                 \n1 Gross domestic product growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percentage. \nhttp://indexmundi.com/pakistan/gdp_real_growth_rate.html. \n2  Government of the Punjab (GoPb). 2004.

The current situation suggests that achieving the MDG target for under-five mortality will \nbe  a  challenge  unless  health  sector  reform  efforts,  including  effective  implementation  of \nminimum service delivery standards (MSDS), are rigorously followed. If there is no significant \nimprovement and if the IMR continues to be as high as 77 per 1,000 live births, Punjab will lose \nalmost 257,000 infants in 2009. There is an urgency to act now and improve access to good \nquality basic MNCH-related health care.  \n7.  Maternal Health (MDG5). Pakistan reports the sixth highest number of maternal deaths, \nabout 15,000 a year.5 Currently, the MMR of Pakistan is estimated to be 400 per 100,000 live \nbirths, which shows a decline from 550 per 100,000 live births in 1990. In Punjab, the MMR is \nestimated to be 300 per 100,000 live births6 against the MDG target of 140 per 100,000 live \nbirths.  \n8.  The main causes of maternal death include hemorrhage (53%), puerperal sepsis (16%), \neclampsia (14%), and incomplete abortion and retained placenta (11%).7 According to the \nexperts, once the postpartum hemorrhage has started the patient has only an hour or two within \nwhich she will require blood transfusion and obstetrical assistance to save her life. The 2006\u2013\n2007 demographic health survey revealed that lack of knowledge is the primary cause of not \nseeking medical assistance, followed by concerns about costs. Physical access to a health \nfacility, including availability of transportation, is also a major problem for some pockets. The \nexisting cultural norms, dominated by patriarchal characteristics and limited mobility of women, \nare sometimes a problem.  \n9.  If the current MMR of 300 in Punjab is not reduced, about 10,000 mothers will die in the \nprocess of giving birth in 2009. Unfortunately, looking at past trends and inefficiencies in health \ncare delivery systems, coupled with the poor status of women in society, it seems highly unlikely \nthat this MDG will be attained unless (i) serious input is provided to reform the health sector; \n(ii) MSDS  are  strictly  implemented;  and  (iii)  effective  obstetric  emergency  care  is  made \naccessible to the masses, particularly in rural areas.    \n2.  Coverage of Health Interventions Essential to Reduce Maternal and Child \nMortality \n10.  Coverage of all essential health interventions is unacceptably low (Table A2.1). This \nfurther illustrates the significant urban\u2013rural disparity in coverage. Since the majority (69%) of \npeople in Punjab resides in rural areas8 where coverage is low, an overall improvement in \nPunjab\u2019s health indicators will not be visible unless attention is given to raise coverage in rural \nareas.  \n                                                 \n4  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2008.

District-Based Multiple \nIndicator Cluster Survey 2003\u201304. Lahore.  \n \n11.  Although all the above indicators are unacceptably low, perhaps the most worrisome is \nthe low proportion of women delivering babies in health facilities, particularly in rural areas. A \nrecent article9 highlights the importance of institutional deliveries and the risk of delivering at \nhome, even by a skilled birth attendant, since there is a limit to what a skilled person can do in a \nhome. \n12.  It is critical for policy makers and program implementers to start thinking of ways of \nencouraging institutional deliveries if MDG5 is to be achieved. At least addressing institutional \nbarriers\u2014such as the unavailability of women medical officers (WMOs), gynecologists, lady \nhealth visitors, and midwives; and ensuring privacy at labor rooms, physical standards, and \navailability of equipment and supplies\u2014could be a starting point by the Health Department.   \n13.  Nutritional Status of Children. Malnutrition among children is identified as a major \nunderlying condition that predisposes children to fatal diseases, leading to high mortality. The \nprevalence of 34% malnutrition in Punjab is higher than the threshold of the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) to call it a serious public health problem.  \n14.  Health Awareness and Basic Hygiene Practices. One of the major causes of child \nmortality is diarrhea, which can be prevented with simple basic hygiene practices. In Punjab, \nonly 41% of households reported using soap to wash their hands before eating food and 55% \nafter using toilets.   \n3.  Health Care Provision and Service Utilization \n15.  In Punjab, health care is offered through the network of health facilities in the public and \nprivate sectors. The public sector consists of primary care facilities including 188 maternal and \nchild  health  centers,  2,456  basic  health  units  (BHUs),  293  rural  health  centers  (RHCs); \nsecondary  care  facilities  including  77  tehsil  headquarter  hospitals  (THQs)  and  35  district \nheadquarter  hospitals  (DHQs)  for  inpatient  and  outpatient  care;  and  tertiary  care  facilities \n                                                 \n9 Campbell, Oona M. R., and Wendy J. Graham. 2006. Strategies for Reducing Maternal Mortality: Getting on with \nWhat Works.

Despite this elaborate infrastructure in the public \nsector, the majority (72%) of patients use the private sector.10 There was no significant increase \nin the utilization of services at BHUs and RHCs from1997 to 2006.11   \n16.  The  major  causes of underutilization  of  the public sector  are  unavailability  of staff, \nunfriendly attitude of staff, short working hours, and lack of drugs. Recent provision of incentives \nand rigorous monitoring by the Health Sector Reform Program (HSRP) and the Punjab Rural \nSupport Program (PRSP) have resulted in availability of staff and a significant reduction in \nabsenteeism. As a result, a 30% increase in utilization at BHUs and RHC is reported.12 However, \nutilization of health facilities for deliveries and postnatal care continues to be unacceptably low. \nThis requires a serious rethink and new strategies. \n17.  Private Sector. The private sector is concentrated in urban areas, and generally offers \ncurative care through small private office-based clinics. There are some 46 private hospitals in \nPunjab, with a range of 10 to over 100 beds, including small maternity homes with very basic \nequipment. Considering Punjab\u2019s 35 districts and the number of private hospitals in big cities, \nthese statistics are a gross underestimate of the actual number of private hospitals in the \nprovince. The private sector also includes pharmacies and non-pharmacy retail outlets from \nwhere, more often than not, an unqualified dispenser sells all kinds of prescription and over-the-\ncounter drugs.13    \n18.  Referral System. The referral system is extremely weak and largely self-directed. For \neffective service delivery related to the MNCH services, it is essential that all services from \ncommunity level to DHQs are linked in a chain of referral. An effective referral system is \nparticularly critical when it comes to emergency obstetric care where efficient referral and \neffective handling of the referred case can prevent maternal death.  \n19  Procurement of Drugs. The shortage of drugs in a health facility is a major reason for \nlow utilization of the health facilities. The shortage is due to lower budgetary allocation as well \nas an inefficient procurement and drug-testing procedure.   \n4.  Health Human Resources  \n20.  To implement MNCH-related MSDS successfully, there is a critical need to have an \nadequate number of health workers (particularly WMOs, midwives, nurses, lady health visitors, \nand paramedics) with adequate skills in addressing the health needs of mother and child. \nCurrently, about 22% of the approved posts for various health workers at BHUs and RHCs in \nPunjab are vacant, although GoPb has introduced various incentive schemes and the vacancies \nhave been gradually reduced. Among medical staff, the highest proportion (32%) of vacant \nposts14 is for the WMO who is expected to play a critical role in preventing maternal death. \nSimilarly, 37% of the approved posts for nurses at BHUs and RHCs are vacant. At DHQs, \nalmost one third of the approved posts of gynecologists and anesthetists are vacant. The \nsituation is even worst at THQs where 48% of the sanctioned posts for gynecologists and 59% \nfor anesthetists are vacant. \n                                                 \n10  Government of Pakistan. 2007.

Punjab. \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n21.  If MNCH-related MSDS is to be implemented effectively, then about an extra 27,068 new \nposts will be required to be sanctioned and filled. This comprises 664 specialists including \ngynecologists/obstetricians,  anesthetists,  and  pediatricians;  about  1,550  medical  officers \nincluding  WMOs;  5,000  nurses;  3,000  each  of  lady  health  visitors  and  midwives;  and \n1,000 paramedical staff including operation theater technicians and lab technicians. Against this \nrequirement, Punjab produced 1,400\u20131,600 nurses and 78 and 351 lady health visitors  per year \nfrom 2004 to 2006, who cannot all be expected to work in the public sector. Although the \nproduction of doctors (Figure A2.1) including female doctors, is higher than nurses, many \nfemale doctors have either left the profession after marriage, prefer being with their families, or \nfavor  shorter  working  hours  in  urban  areas.  The  availability  of  WMOs  for  rural  area  is  a \nchallenge.   \n \nNumber \n   \nof \nFigure A2.1: Trends in Health Human Resource Production \nWorkers \n  100000\n \n  90000\n \n80000\n   \n70000\n \n  60000\n \n  50000 \n40000\n  30000 \n \n  2 0000\n  1   0  0  0  00  \n  1947  1951  1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 Year\n \n  Health facilities Doctors Nurses\n SoSuorucrec:e A: DABsi asnta Dff ecvaelclouplamtieonnt  oBna gnokv cearlncmuleantito onf  oPnu gnojavbe rdnamtae.n t of Punjab data. \n \n \n22.  Apart from the insufficient quantity of health workers, quality is a serious issue. Medical \ntraining institutions in Pakistan produce the bulk of doctors without any application of quality \nstandards, and the quality of paramedics is also below the requisite standard. The entrance \nrequirement for dispensers is 10 years of schooling. Since 1947, only 34,599 dispensers have \nbeen qualified out of 1.2 million who appeared for the exam after 1 year of training. The quality \nof training offered is very low because of lack of conducive physical conditions and unavailability \nof training equipment and resources at the training institutions. Consequently, the quality of \nparamedics is low and they are inadequately prepared to offer the required quality of care.    \n \n23.  Furthermore, issues of contract-based tenure of health care providers, no opportunity for \ncontinuing  education,  lack  of  effective  and  objective  appraisal,  and  no  incentive  for  good \nperformance are some factors leading to de-motivation.    \n24.  Mandatory medicolegal duty by WMOs at RHCs is a deterring factor. WMOs are not \njoining  RHCs,  mainly  because  they  are  required  to  attend  to  medicolegal  cases  and \nconsequently face political pressures and harassment. As a result, there are hardly any WMOs \nat RHCs. This is one of the reasons that women do not come to health facilities for deliveries. \nRecently,  the  national MNCH  program  succeeded  in  getting  an  approval  for  exemption  of \nWMOs from this requirement but it may take a while before this can be implemented.    \n ", "Appendix 2  41 \n5.  Infrastructure and Equipment Maintenance \n25.  The trend in Pakistan and Punjab shows that, once the facility is erected, adequate \nallocation is never made toward its maintenance until the infrastructure is completely run-down. \nUnder the HSRP, a major initiative is under way to rehabilitate facilities but several BHUs \nlocated in remote villages have still not been renovated. Physically, the examination room and \nparticularly the labor room do not offer sufficient privacy for rural women to be comfortable in \nreceiving medical care.    \n26.  A recent study showed that, in both the public and private sectors, half of the overall \nfacilities had operation theaters available but only 38% were functional.15 Currently, there are \nonly three workshops in Punjab for repair of such medical equipment, and they have very limited \ncapacity. Therefore, these workshops are mostly giving no-objections to DHQs/THQs to go to \nprivate firms for maintenance. However, this process requires time and energy for the DHQ \nteam to secure a no-objection certificate allowing them to go to private firms for maintenance. \nB.  Health Care Financing  \n27.  In  Pakistan,  public  health  care  is  financed  by  three  different  levels  of  government: \nfederal,  provincial,  and  district.16 Despite  this,  public  health  care  in  Pakistan  has  been \npersistently underfinanced. Per capita public health expenditure is the lowest among South \nAsian countries (Table A2.2).  \nTable A2.2: Health Care Financing in South Asia (2004) \nSri \nItem  Pakistan  Bangladesh  India  Nepal  Lanka \n \nTotal expenditure on health as percentage     \nof GDP (%)  2.2 3.1  5.0 5.6  4.3 \nGovernment expenditure on health as   \npercentage of total expenditure on health  19.6 28.1  17.3 26.3   45.6 \n(%)         \nGovernment expenditure on health as   \npercentage of total government  1.9  5.9   2.9  8.1   8.4  \nexpenditure (%)         \n   \nPer capita total expenditure on health ($)   47.7 64.3  91.4  71.0  162.6  \n        \n \nPer capita government expenditure on  9.4  18.1   15.8  18.6   74.1  \nhealth ($)          \n  GDP = gross domestic product \n  Source: World Health Organization database. \n \n28.  In Punjab, public spending in the health sector has been growing over the past few years \nboth  in  absolute  terms  and  as  a  share  of  total  public  spending.  Nonetheless, with  health \nspending still averaging only 8% of total public spending, additional funding is needed if Punjab \nis to meet the minimum requirements of the population\u2019s health needs.  \n                                                 \n15 United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID).  2005.  Health  Facility  Assessment  Methods. \nWashington, DC (The Pakistan Initiative for Mothers and Newborn Project by USAID conducted in Lahore). \n16 The 2001 devolution made the districts responsible for primary and secondary health care, which is the key to \nattaining MDGs, whereas the provincial Health Department has retained responsibility for the provision of tertiary \ncare services, medical education, and research and development; and has been given a major role in policy setting \nfor the health sector. \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \n \n29.  The importance of public sector under-financing is more evident by examining per capita \nspending.  Against  a  benchmark  of  $30\u2013$40  per  capita  recommended  by  the  WHO  for \ndeveloping countries, per capita spending in Punjab was equal to PRS270.7 as of FY200717 and \nis projected to increase to PRS420.93 in FY2009. Table A2.3 shows per capita spending for \nprovincial  and  district governments  separately.  The  low  per  capita  spending at  the  district \ngovernment level points to severe under-financing of primary and secondary health services, \nwhich are crucial for attainment of the MDGs.  \nTable A2.3: Per Capita Health Spending in Punjab \n  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009a \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  RE  BE \nPer capita health sector  143.29  179.94  270.72  358.72  420.93 \nspending (PRs) \nPer capita health sector  2.43  3.00  4.47  5.77  6.38 \nspending ($) \nof which:           \nProvincial ($)  1.22  1.59  2.46  3.02  3.49 \nDistrict ($)  1.21  1.42  2.01  2.75  2.89 \nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \na For FY2009 the rupee\u2013US dollar exchange rate is assumed equal tot the average of the last quarter of FY2008 or \nPRs66 = $1.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank elaboration on government of the Punjab data; International Monetary Fund \nstatistics on exchange rate for various years.  \n \n30.  Moreover, efficiency in the use of existing resources is an issue. Both at the provincial \nand  district  level,  recurrent  spending  (mostly  in  the  form  of  salaries)  absorbs  the  bulk  of \nresources. During FY2004 to FY2007, for which information on actual expenditures is available, \nrecurrent expenditures accounted for 80% of provincial government expenditures and more than \n90% of district expenditures on average. Conversely, development expenditures are almost \nnegligible. During the same period under consideration, more than 80% of development outlays \nwere from the provincial government budget.  \n31.  The low share of district health spending (both in per capita terms and development \nspending) is a cause for concern, considering that district governments have been responsible \nfor financing and delivering both primary and secondary health care services, which are key to \nachieving the MDGs and reducing poverty, since the 2001 devolution. District governments\u2019 \nability to provide adequate financing to the health sector is limited in many respects. Their low \nrevenue-raising  autonomy  and  the  rigidity  of  expenditures  considerably  reduce  flexibility  in \nresource allocation. Moreover, under the devolved setup, district governments\u2019 authority to \napprove investment projects is limited to PRs50 million, which is a very low threshold. This \nleaves the most expensive capital investment projects to the provincial and federal government \ninitiative. During FY2008, 45% of the provincial government\u2019s annual development plan for the \nhealth sector was allocated to primary and secondary health care. In addition, the federal \ngovernment and the donor community funded several other initiatives. These multiple sources \nof funding target similar areas, which results in overlaps, high transaction costs, and inefficient \nallocation of financial and human resources. Although district governments are to some extent \ninvolved  in  implementation  of  the  vertical  and  donor-funded  programs,  they  seldom  have \nenough capacity to coordinate different interventions, which often carry competing requests. \n                                                 \n17 The corresponding figure for Pakistan as a whole was $9.4 as of FY2004.  \n ", "Appendix 2  43 \n \nB.  Public Health Financial Management  \n1.  Public Financial Management in Theory  \n32.  The  budget,  as  a  management  tool  for  economic  and  fiscal  planning,  is  the \ncommunication of a plan for a given period expressed in financial terms, and is a means of \ncontrolling and monitoring the use of funds. Effective planning of programs and activities should \nprecede budget preparation so that the main policy priorities of government can be translated \ninto  manageable  components  and  subsequently  costed  to  determine  affordability.  Budget \npreparation should then follow at the end of this process.  \n \n33.  Effective budget execution requires on the one hand that spending departments receive \nreliable information on available funds within which they can commit expenditure. This may be \nundermined by poor access to budget during the year and may lead to a downward revision of \nallocations in the revised budget estimates. On the other hand, basic management accounting \npractices throughout the year should enable management to analyze underperforming activities \nand take corrective action accordingly. This relies on the preparation of systematic financial \nreports, and constant checking and verification of the bookkeeping and recording practices of \nbudget. Important reconciliations should be undertaken on a regular (daily, weekly, monthly) \nbasis  to  ensure  accuracy  in  recording,  reliability  in  reporting,  and  control  to  ensure  that \nadequate checks and balances exist at key points in the system.  \n \n34.  The quality of the internal control systems within an organization affects the fiduciary \nenvironment, hence the efficiency of public spending. Organizations and their systems are \nsusceptible to weaknesses and risks, resulting in the possibility of poor performance, error \nand/or abuse. Senior management, therefore, introduces and maintains control procedures to \nensure that organizational objectives are achieved and public standards are met. Internal audit, \nin turn, relies on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. The \ninternal audit department of any organization is an integral part of the management of that \norganization. It can be defined as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity \ndesigned  to  add  value  and  improve  an  organization\u2019s  operations.  It  helps  an  organization \naccomplish  its  objectives  by  bringing  a  systematic,  disciplined  approach  to  evaluate  and \nimprove the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. \n \n35.  Unlike  internal  auditors,  external  auditors  are  independent  of  the  organization,  and \nprovide an annual opinion on the financial statements. The work of the internal and external \nauditors should be coordinated for optimal effectiveness and efficiency. The primary mission of \nthe  external  auditors  is  to  provide  an  independent  opinion  on  the  organization\u2019s  financial \nstatements  annually.  Their  approach  is  historical  in  nature,  as  they  assess  whether  the \nstatements conform to generally accepted accounting principles, whether they fairly present the \nfinancial position of the organization, whether the results of operations for a given period are \naccurately represented, and whether the financial statements have been materially affected. \n \n2.  Budget Formulation and Execution by the Health Department and District \nGovernments \n36.  The GoPb prepares two budgets\u2014the annual development budget and the recurrent \nbudget. The two budget setting processes are entirely separate exercises, with insufficient \nconsideration of the links between the two. In the Health Department, incremental budgeting \nserves to perpetuate inefficiencies and imbalances in inputs and resource allocation decisions. \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nInvolvement in budget preparation remains at the lower levels of the department, with the result \nthat the sight of goals and objectives for the health sector can be lost along with an opportunity \nto develop a budget based on the agreed priorities for health service delivery. The budget \nexercise has poor credibility as actual expenditures considerably differ from the original budget \nestimates,  whereas  revised  estimates  produced  in  March  heavily  overestimate  the  actual \nspending capacity of the department. Figure A2.2 illustrates the trend of underspending of the \nHealth Department budget and shows the systematic tendency to inflate revised estimates \ntoward the end of the fiscal year. Figure A2.3 shows how the lack of budget credibility is more \nsevere for the development budget compared to the recurrent budget.  \n \nFigure A2.2: Credibility of the Budget in Health Department \n140% \n120% \n100% \n80% \n60% \n40% \n20% \n0% \n-20%  FY2004  FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 \n-40% \n-60% \nOverestimate (RE/Actual) Underspending (Actual/BE) \nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \nActual figures for FY2008 are up to April 2008.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation on government of Punjab data.         \n   \n ", "Appendix 2  45 \nFigure A2.3: Budget Credibility of Health Department \n   Recurrent and Development\n200% \n150% \n100% \n50% \n0%\nFY2004  FY2005 FY2006 Fy2007 FY2008\n-50% \n-100%\nOverestimate (Recurrent; RE/Actual)) Underspending (Recurrent; Actual/BE) \nOverestimate (Development; RE/Actual) Underspending (Development; Actual/BE) \nBE = budget estimates, RE = revised estimates. \nActual figures for FY2008 are up to April 2008.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation on government of the Punjab data.  \n \n \n37.  As access to funds is not smooth throughout the year, departments tend to concentrate \nmost of the outlays in the last quarter. The capacity to spend according to allocations also \nremains limited, which may be due to low absorptive capacity and/or poor expenditure planning. \nThe latter aspect is particularly severe in the case of the development budget, where poor \ncapacity to plan investment projects and the political economy of the annual development \nprogram result in implementation delays and a substantial part of the development budget is \ncarried over to the next year\u2019s budget.  \n \n38.  Proper financial management relies on the possibility to analyze the links between policy \nand budgetary allocations. This is currently not possible in the health sector in Punjab. Financial \nmanagement in the province is constrained by widespread unavailability of reliable financial \ninformation with which to analyze expenditures in the health sector against policy objectives and \npriorities. While plenty of financial data is available, much of it is inconsistent and gives little or \nno indication of how much is spent, where, and on what.  \n \n39.  As a result, performance measurement, both physical and financial, is not possible \nbecause  of  lack  of  an  integrated  and  informed  budget  statement\u2014the  split  between \nnondevelopment and development and between the various separate development initiatives. \nThe development budget is not structured using the Project for Improved Financial Reporting \nand Accounting (PIFRA) classifications (although they are broadly similar). Hence, alignment or \nanalysis of budgets and expenditures using these codes is not possible, making it difficult to \nidentify the flow of public resources into the same sector or program from the two budgets. By \nhaving appropriate links between the structure of how the budget is prepared and policy goals, \nthe Health Department should be able to establish the amount of funds allocated toward a \ncertain policy objective. This will require classification of the budget at all levels of the health \nsector on the basis of \u201cpolicy aligned\u201d subfunctional or program classification codes. \n ", "46  Appendix 2 \n40  At both the provincial and district level, there is an absence of consolidated financial \nreporting showing budget execution for the various health programs and spending units. At \ndistrict level, the executive district officer (EDO), Health does not have a comprehensive picture \nof what resources are being consumed by facilities in his or her district. No regular financial \nstatements on budget utilization are prepared, which would enable the EDO, Health to measure \nperformance against planned targets and as such, he or she is unable to manage programs \neffectively  and  hold  staff  and  facilities  responsible  for  delivery  of  services.  Similarly,  the \nsecretary of health, as the principal accounting officer, has little access to any consolidated \nfinancial  information  at  any  significant  level  to  scrutinize  properly  the  performance  of \nsubordinate  officers,  facilities,  or  spending  units,  let  alone  having  an  overview  of  overall \nresource allocation and financial performance in the public health sector.    \n3.  Internal Control  \n41.  Internal controls are the various checks and balances set within an organization to \nsafeguard  the  integrity  of  expenditure.  They  are  a  critical  part  of  public  expenditure \nmanagement and governance more generally. On the one hand, there is in a formal sense an \nextensive system of internal controls, including well-documented approval processes; numerous \nmanuals and guidelines, including the GoPb\u2019s financial rules and regulations, the purchase \nmanual,  and  standardized  registers;  a  well-entrenched,  hierarchical,  \u201capprovals  culture  by \ndocumentation\u201d;  and  an  extensive\u2014albeit  manual\u2014\u201cpaper  trail\u201d.  On  the  other  hand,  these \ninternal controls are often cumbersome and administratively burdensome. More importantly, \nwhile the internal controls are in principle generally sound and sensible, they are in practice \nadhered to in a weak and uneven manner. There is limited technical capacity to implement \nprocedures in the way envisaged, and weak supervision and enforcement, especially at the \ndistrict government level. However, there are improvements\u2014the PIFRA is streamlining the \nchart  of  accounts  and  financial  management,  and  enabling  quicker  and  more  accurate \nreconciliation of accounting information via an electronic rather than manual system.  \n42.  Punjab\u2019s  system  of  internal  controls  against  the  internationally  recognized  internal \ncontrol benchmarks are as follows: \n(i)  Segregation of duties. Segregation of duties does exist in the health sector. For \nexample,  in  a  DHQ  hospital  setting,  goods  are  ordered  by  a  medical \nsuperintendent;  received  and  recorded  by  a  storekeeper;  and  processing  of \npayment against supplier\u2019s invoice is done by the hospital\u2019s accounts staff, which \nis then authorized by the district accounts officer (DAO) to release the payment \ndirectly in supplier\u2019s bank account. However, in this whole process, the vested \ninterest plays its role at almost every stage to defeat the spirit of segregation of \npowers.  \n \n(ii)  Effective organizational structures. The current organizational structure does \nnot  facilitate  effective,  efficient,  or  transparent  financial  management  and \nfinancial flows. The existence of national, provincial, and district organizations\u2014\nall providing separate aspects, and funding, for health care\u2014is problematic. This \nsituation  is  likely  to  be  exacerbated  if  another  layer  at  divisional  level  is \nintroduced,  or  certain  tertiary  level  hospitals  returned  to  the  provincial \ngovernment, thus fracturing the referral chain from primary to secondary levels. \n \n(iii)  Appropriate  levels  of  authorization  and  approval  adhered  to.  Rules  on \ndelegation of financial powers in Punjab exist, and were revised in 2006 to take \n ", "Appendix 2  47 \ninto effect the structural and fiscal changes brought in by devolution. However, \nadherence to these approval limits remains an issue. Noncompliance with these \nrules and regulations occurs at both the district and provincial levels. Many of the \npending  audit  observations  relate  to  the  noncompliance  with  rules  and \nregulations.18 \n \n(iv)  Physical  safeguards.  These  are  necessary  to  protect  personnel,  assets, \nsystems,  and  records.  In  the  Health  Department,  management  review  and \nmonitoring of assets does not take place in a systematic manner, nor controls \nprovided by external audit, which is confined to the audit of financial statements \nonly. Under current arrangements, the payroll function (preparation of payroll \nbudgets, payment of salaries, posting of costs to the PIFRA system, etc.) is a \nfunction of the DAO\u2019s office, with the obligation on the drawing and disbursement \nofficers in each line department to notify the DAO of any changes in personnel. \nUnder these shared responsibilities, there is little to prevent (or even detect at a \nlater date) a drawing and disbursement officer from retaining the salary paid for a \nmember of staff who has left the service.   \n \n(v)  Management review and monitoring. Under the present arrangements, there is \nlittle evidence, if any, of monitoring to ensure that personnel understand the \nsystems,  processes,  procedures,  and  activities  established  by  management. \nExpenditure  management  and  tracking  is  missing  across  the  whole  system. \nMostly, time is spent on budget preparation, execution, and recording of financial \ninformation in the prescribed books of accounts. Arrangements exist wherein the \ndrawing and disbursement officers reconcile their expenditure with the DAO on a \nmonthly basis. This is the only form of reconciliation that takes place at the \ndistrict  level.  There  is  little,  if  any,  analytical  or  diagnostic  work\u2014including \nvariance accounting\u2014so it is not possible for the Government to satisfy itself that \nexpenditures are being allocated or aligning with its core priorities.   \n \n(vi)  Accounting and arithmetical controls. These exist only in the DAO\u2019s office at \ndistrict level and in the Accountant General\u2019s Office for provincial expenditures. \nThere is very limited adherence, at any level in the health sector, to statutory and \nother professional requirements to maintain proper accounts, ledger balances, \nand reconciliation procedures; and to ensure transactions are correctly recorded \nand processed. \n \n(vii)  Appropriate  personnel  and  staffing  levels.  The  numbers  and  levels  of \napproved  staffing  positions  responsible  for  financial  management  are  poorly \nallocated between province and district. However, it is clear that the technical \ncapacity and professional qualifications of staff remain a challenge. Particularly at \nthe district government level, there is a noticeable absence of trained or qualified \naccounting  officials  and/or  internal  auditors  to  manage  and  supervise \nexpenditures and procurement.    \n \n(viii)  Effective supervision of controls and systems. Reliance on pre-audit and \nexternal audit as substitutes for internal controls has increased fiduciary risk at all \nlevels of government in Punjab. Internal audit remains very weak, especially at \ndistrict levels.  \n                                                 \n18 World Bank. 2005. Punjab Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n ", "48  Appendix 2 \n4.  Internal Audit  \n42.  International accounting standards dictate that any organization should have effective \ninternal audit. The internal audit function is an integral part of the organization\u2019s management \nand it is based on the presence of an adequate, effective, and reliable set of internal controls. \nThe findings and recommendations included in a standard internal audit report are reported to \nthe management of the organization, which should then act upon these recommendations. \nSubsequent internal audits would begin with previous recommendations and whether or not \nmanagement has acted in response. Internal audit work can, and often is, relied upon by \nexternal  auditors  to  help  target  the  time-limited  external  audit  to  areas  of  greatest  control \nweakness and to avoid duplication. \n43.  In the health sector and in Punjab in general, the internal audit function is not effective. \nAlthough  the  internal  audit  wing  in  the  Health  Department  exists,  the  director  and  deputy \ndirector posts are vacant. The \u201cconfidential\u201d nature of the internal audit reports, unclear role and \ndirection of the internal audit wing, its reporting line to the additional secretary for establishment, \nand the absence of any training for the audit team are symptoms of the poor effectiveness of the \ninternal audit function in the health sector.  \n44.  At the district government level, the internal audit function is non-existent. Although \nmandated  by  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  (PLGO),  very  few  nazims  (district \nmayors) have appointed internal auditors. There is, from the part of the district governments\u2019 \nbureaucracy, a generalized mistrust toward the internal audit function mostly because it reports \nto the nazim. This is in fact a flaw in the PLGO since the internal auditor should report to the \ndistrict coordination officer as the chief executive of the district. This problem is compounded by \nthe lack of clear terms of service and job descriptions for the internal auditors, which make their \nappointment even more controversial. According to some GoPb officials, in those few cases \nwhere an internal auditor has been appointed by nazims, patronage has prevailed with little \nregard to the professional qualifications of the appointee.  \n5.  External Audit  \n45.  The auditor general of Pakistan is responsible for external audit of both the provincial \nand district governments. Both provincial and district director generals for audit offices conduct \nsystematic external audit of provincial and district governments\u2019 entities. They mostly perform \nfinancial audit, but in the case of the provincial office, risk-based audit and performance audit of \nselected functions of selected spending agencies is also carried out. The external audit also \ncomprises a compliance testing with internal controls for a given institution and this is reportedly \none of the high-risk areas for many institutions within the Health Department. Based on the audit \nobservations raised by the director general for audit, the Health Department should convene the \nDepartmental Accounts Committee, which is chaired by the secretary, to address the audit \nobservations  raised  by  the  external  audit.  It  is  not  clear,  however,  to  what  extent  the \nDepartmental Accounts Committee is regularly convened and audit observations cleared. A \nsimilar situation is found at the district governments\u2019 level, where there is poor follow-up on \nexternal audit observations.   \nC.  Conclusion \n46.  Punjab health sector analysis shows that it is unlikely to achieve MDGs unless the health \nsector is effectively reformed to make good quality MNCH services accessible to the masses in \nPunjab. Apart from technical improvements of health workers, and physical health facilities, \n ", "Appendix 2  49 \nstrengthening  public  financial  management  practices  in  Punjab\u2019s  health  sector  is  likely  to \ncontribute to qualitative and quantitative improvements of public health service delivery.  \n \n47.  To bridge the urban\u2013rural inequity in coverage, more allocation will be required toward \nservices in rural areas along with enhanced efficiency and institutional capacity to deliver good \nquality services. Furthermore, to achieve the MDG related to the MMR, a significant policy shift \nwill be required to encourage institutional delivery to ensure all required care can be offered, \nincluding emergency obstetric care.   \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \nTIME FRAME FOR ACHIEVING MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN PUNJAB \n \nProjected \nYear  \n2003\u2013 of Reaching  2015 \nIndicator  FY2002 2005  FY2008  MDG  MDGs \nEducation Sector           \nLiteracy rate 10 years and above (5)  47  54  65  FY2014  88 \nNet enrolment rate at primary level (%) [Male]  47  60  76.07  FY2013  100 \nNet enrolment rate at primary level (%)  43  55  70.35  FY2013  100 \n[Female] \nNet enrolment rate at primary level (%) [Both]  45  58  74.20  FY2013  100 \nGender parity index for tertiary education  0.78 0.88  0.94  FY2008  0.94\nHealth Sector \nInfant mortality rate per 1,000 live births  82  77  69  FY2015  40 \nUnder-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births  119  112  99  FY2015  52 \nChildren <5 years underweight for age (%)  41.5  34  26  FY2012  <20 \nChildren fully immunized 12\u201323 months (%)  57  66  80  FY2011  >90 \nMaternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births  350  300  244  FY2019  140 \nTotal fertility rate  4.7  3.3    FY2015  2.1 \nDelivery by trained birth attendants (%)  24  32  47  FY2015  >90 \nContraceptive prevalence rate (%)  27.6  36  51  FY2009  55 \nWater Supply & Sanitation Sector \nAccess to piped water (% rural)  6  10.6  23  FY2009  25 \nAccess to hand/motor pump (% rural)  70  80  96  FY2002  70 \nAccess to flush toilet (% rural)  31  39.5  55  FY2014  90 \nMDG = Millennium Development Goal. \nSources: Government of Pakistan. 2002.

The 2001 Punjab Local Government Ordinance made district governments responsible \nfor delivering primary and secondary health care. Consequently, each district has to prepare its \nown plan of action and budget to reach the district health goals. The Punjab Devolved Social \nServices Program (PDSSP)1 introduced the annual sector plan exercise as a condition for \nreceiving PDSSP tied grants; this evolved to be the 3-year rolling sector plan. Under the Punjab \nMillennium  Development  Goals  Program  (PMDGP),  district  governments  are  expected  to \nreceive conditional grants to augment financial resources for the health sector, especially to \nimplement maternal, neonatal, and child health-related minimum service delivery standards \n(MSDS). The district governments will be required to include the MSDS implementation plan in \nthe 3-year rolling plan and utilize the conditional grants according to the plan. \n \n2  The existing capacity of district governments to prepare a good plan is still limited. \nTraining has been given by the PDSSP and various programs but the skills have been lost \nbecause of frequent transfers of staff. One-time training is not sufficient to develop capacity. A \nteam of experts devoted to continuous training of district governments and technical assistance \nwill be housed in the Office of Director General, Health Services (ODGHS). To assist district \ngovernments in preparing plans, a team of health planning (2), monitoring and evaluation (2), \nfinancial management (2), and public health (2) specialists will be constituted. The team will visit \ndistricts and provide technical support and facilitate their planning process. In the long run, such \na team of experts should be an integral part of ODGHS. \n  \n3.  The team will support and build the capacity of district governments, especially the \nexecutive district officers (EDOs), Health, in all the districts to prepare an evidence-based \n3-year rolling sector plan, and to establish a mechanism at ODGHS and EDOs, Health to \nmonitor execution of the plans. The team\u2019s tasks are to do the following: \n(i)  Improve the format of the 3-year rolling plan to clearly indicate inputs required for \nproducing the district health goals and meeting MSDS requirements. The format \nshould include the financial sources for each activity.  \n(ii)  Produce  customized  training  and  capacity-building  sessions  for  districts  to \ndevelop \na. 3-year  rolling  sector  plans  that  include  MSDS  implementation,  and   \nrealistically budget the plan; \nb. a built-in mechanism for monitoring and evaluation; \nc.  activity-based budgeting leading to appropriate resource allocation; and \nd.  an advocacy tool for attracting funds for health sector. \n(iii)  Provide onsite technical assistance to district governments in preparing the plans \nand budgets.  \n(iv)  Develop tools to monitor execution of the plan, and help the staff of district \ngovernments use the tools in monitoring the execution of district health plans.  \n(v)  Establish  a  mechanism  for  regularly  preparing  a  summary  quarterly  report \nsubmitted  to  ODGHS,  highlighting  the  progress  and  expenditure  made  in \nimplementing the plan. Such report should be prepared in conjunction with the \nreport from the district health information system (DHIS) in such a way to avoid \nduplication. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

There is a need to strengthen basic financial management and accounting in the Health \nDepartment in Punjab. The many deficiencies in planning, budgeting, accounting, reporting, \nfinancial  control,  internal  audit,  and  oversight  are  well-known.  The  creation  of  a  financial \nmanagement  cell  (FMC)  will  be  the  core  unit  for  driving  financial  reforms  in  the  Health \nDepartment and the spending agencies that it funds, and for collecting budget and expenditure \ninformation from district health departments. \n2.  The following initial key tasks will be performed by the FMC: \n(i)  Ensure strict adherence, by all budget/accounting and drawing and disbursement \nstaff in the Health Department and its spending agencies, to budget preparation \nprinciples. \n(ii)  Revise, coordinate, and monitor the budget preparation calendars to assist the \nhealth budget ceiling committee in securing the accurate and timely completion \nof budget estimates in the medium-term budgetary framework format; and to \ncoordinate  production  of  the  departmental  strategic  review  for  the  Health \nDepartment. \n(iii)  Be the focal point in the Health Department for the Finance Department and \nPlanning  and  Development  Department  in  budget  preparation  to  ensure \nefficiency in the transfer of budgetary information to and from these departments \nto the Health Department. \n(iv)  Develop procedures and systems for the production of budget (detailed and \nconsolidated)  information  on  all  activities  in  the  health  sector,  accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and analysis of expenditure in the health sector. \n(v)  Ensure that, once the budgets have been prepared according to agreed Health \nDepartment objectives, actual expenditure in the Health Department and the \nagencies that it funds, is in accordance with the appropriations made. The FMC \nwill be central to financial reporting in the health sector and will be able to \ngenerate management accounting information to facilitate budgetary control for \ncost center managers, senior managers, the core team, and the secretary (as \nprincipal accounting officer). \n(vi)  Develop appropriate automation tools (including an interface with the Project for \nImproved  Financial  Reporting  and  Accounting  system)  to  assist  in  budget \npreparation and financial reporting; \n(vii)  Review internal control mechanisms in the Health Department and its spending \nagencies.  \n ", "74  Appendix 11 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \nNo withdrawals shall be made in respect of: \n \n(i)  expenditures for goods included in the following groups or subgroups of the \nUnited Nations Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 3 (SITC, \nRev. 3), or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions in the SITC, \nas designated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Borrower: \n \nTable A11: Ineligible Items \nChapter  Heading  Description of Items \n112    Alcoholic beverages \n121    Tobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \n122    Tobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \n525    Radioactive and associated materials \n667    Pearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or \nworked \n718  718.7  Nuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \n728  728.43  Tobacco processing machinery \n897  897.3  Jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except \nwatches and watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 \nwares (including set gems) \n971    Gold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii)  expenditures in the currency of the Borrower or of goods supplied from the \nterritory of the Borrower;  \n \n(iii)  expenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational financing institution or agency will have financed or has agreed to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any loan from ADB;  \n \n(iv)  expenditures for goods intended for a military or paramilitary purpose or for \nluxury consumption;  \n \n(v)  expenditures for narcotics;  \n \n(vi)  expenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport of which is prohibited under the laws of the Borrower or international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \n \n(vii)  expenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance with a decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  \n \n ", "Appendix 12  75 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Pakistan Punjab Millennium Development Goals Program  \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department \nCluster Program loan  \nModality:  Division:  Governance, Finance and Trade  Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nPakistan\u2019s health indicators are the worst among South Asian countries. For instance, Pakistan\u2019s infant mortality rate \n(IMR) is 78 compared to 57 in India and 46 in Nepal. Poor people have the worst health outcomes. They are pushed \nfurther into poverty because of ill health, resulting in lower productivity or loss of daily wages, and the burden of health \ncare  expenditure.  Pakistan  rightly  recognizes  the  importance  of  improving  health  outcomes  (i.e.,  health  sector \ninvestments) as an important part of the Government\u2019s poverty alleviation plan (Pakistan\u2019s national health policy 2001).  \n \nPakistan, especially Punjab, has demonstrated strong commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), and actively monitoring the MDG indicators. The health care budget has increased substantially in the last few \nyears. Despite these efforts, Punjab is unlikely to achieve the MDG targets for reduction of the maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR) and IMR without extra efforts and reforms in health service delivery, while it may achieve all other MDGs. \n \nThe Punjab Millennium Development Goals Program intends to improve health services delivery by improving quality \nand standards of health care, increasing public health financing, improving the efficiency of public health financing, and \ninstitutional management of health service delivery. The country partnership strategy 2007\u20132011, which is being \nfinalized, includes support for reforms to address governance and institutional bottlenecks leading to improved delivery \nof inclusive social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI-M \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe majority of maternal and infant deaths in Punjab are preventable if women and children have timely access to \nquality preventive, primary, and secondary health care. Access is limited or delayed because health services are not \nphysically available in their neighborhood, doctors and/medicines are not available, or services are unaffordable. Even \nif health care services are available, their quality is not always optimal. Punjab\u2019s health service delivery system needs \nquantitative and qualitative improvements, and measures to reduce the burden of health care expenditure on the poor.  \n \nPrivate practitioners are prevalent, but in rural areas they are often quacks and unskilled birth attendants. Qualified \nprivate health care is more expensive than public health care. Thus, it is essential to improve public primary and \nsecondary health care, if Punjab is to reduce the IMR and MMR among the poor.  \n \nThe poor quality of public primary and secondary health is mainly due to historical under-financing of health care in \nPakistan. Pakistan\u2019s per capita public health expenditure is the lowest in South Asia. It spends only about $9 per \nperson, against the $30\u2013$40 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for developing countries. In \naddition, the limited resources have not been utilized cost-effectively. Until 2 years ago, the majority of the health care \nbudget of the government of Punjab went to tertiary health care, which mainly serves the urban population and whose \nbenefits are known to be regressively distributed.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \n(i)  The Program is aimed at improving maternal, neonatal, and child (MNCH) services for rural areas, where \nsocial indicators are worse than those urban areas. Availability of health services is a major problem in \nrural areas. \n(ii)  The Program focuses on primary and secondary health care, whose benefits are more progressively \ndistributed than those of tertiary health care. \n(iii)  The Program supports health cards that will target the bottom 30% of pregnant women, in accordance \nwith the present plan, although the plan has to be detailed and tested first.  \n \n ", "76  Appendix 12 \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nDiscuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and \nmajor groups affected. \n \nBetter primary and secondary health services will lead to better health of the populations and lead to increased \nproductivity. In addition, affordable health services available for the poorer segment of the population will prevent them \nfrom falling deeper into poverty. \n \n1.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis). \n \nThe health sector reforms are especially focused on women and children in rural areas who cannot afford proper private \nhealth care. They are the most vulnerable populations in Punjab.  \n \n2.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n  \nThe entire program is to attain health MDGs 4 and 5.. A sustainable health care financing system to be designed by \n2011 will pool the health risks of the rich and the poor, and let the rich compensate for the poor. This  will mitigate \nburden of health care expenditure on the poor.    \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe main beneficiaries are pregnant women and young children in rural areas. Secondary beneficiaries are other \nresidents of rural areas who use public health facilities. As discussed above, these beneficiaries tend to come from \npoorer households, as the better off choose private practitioners for curative care. Causes of disparity in access to \nhealth services or other social in services in Punjab is (i) residence\u2014either rural or urban, (ii) gender, and (iii) economic \nstatus.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) team consulted with a wide range of government staff both in the provincial and \ndistrict governments, and health workers at primary and secondary health care facilities, federal health programs, \nPunjab Medical and Dentistry Association, and other development partners. The team also consulted with a group of \nlady health workers who work in the beneficiaries\u2019 community. Although systematic consultation with beneficiaries was \nnot conducted, the team reviewed the studies based on survey and focus group meetings among the beneficiaries.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Program mainly focuses on supply-side constraints and on the health system. The major premise of the Program \nis that by reducing cost and increasing availability of health care, the beneficiaries will change their health-seeking \nbehavior. The issue is to disseminate information on improved health services to the beneficiaries quickly, so that they \ncan make an informed decision. Therefore, the policy matrix has included dissemination of information to beneficiaries.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.   \n \nThe low socioeconomic status of women in Pakistan has been well-documented. The biggest constraint in women\u2019s \naccess to health services is their low level of education. For example, more than more than 70% of women who have \nsecondary  education  deliver  at  health  facilities,  while  only  20%  of  uneducated  women  do.  Punjab  has  been \n ", "Appendix 12  77 \nimplementing education reform to increase the primary school enrollment rate. At present, the primary school net \nenrollment rate is 70%, which shows there will be an increase in institutional deliveries in the future leading to reduced \nMMR and IMR. In the meantime, stress is given to awareness building about danger signs of pregnancy in rural \ncommunities, through lady health workers; and increasing the availability of 24-hour obstetric and health care and \nwomen medical doctors in rural areas.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe program primarily focuses on health services for pregnant women and young children, and indicators monitored \ninclude reproductive health indicators.  \nIII.
