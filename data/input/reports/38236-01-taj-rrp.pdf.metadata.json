An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nundertaken in 2005 and the summary initial environmental examination \nwas uploaded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website. \n \nThe  Project  approved  in  2005  is  a  government  priority.  It  aims  to \nrehabilitate  the  road  from  Dushanbe  to  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2014part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC)  Transport  Corridors  3  and  5.  The  supplementary  grant  will \nreinforce  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs.  It \nthe  entire  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  (project \nwill  complete \ncorridor). \n \nThe  supplementary  grant  outputs  are  (i)  the  rehabilitated  road  section \nfrom Obigarm to Nurobod (km 95\u2013km 140), (ii) the repaired emergency \nbypass road at km 110\u2013km 112, (iii) the improved central section from \nNurobod  to  Nimich  (km  140\u2013km  217),  and  (iv)  the  upgraded  border \nsection at Karamik. The new financing will improve 127 kilometers (km) \nof the project corridor and 7 km of the bypass road. \n \nThe  project  corridor  is  a  flagship  road  in  Tajikistan  and  is  part  of  the \nCAREC Transport Corridors 3 and 5 under the CAREC Transport and \nTrade  Facilitation  Strategy\u2014connecting  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the \nKyrgyz Republic, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan.  Because  of  its  poor  condition,  the  corridor  obstructs \nregional  trade  and  domestic  commercial  activities.  The  rehabilitated \nproject corridor will spur regional connectivity, trade, and jobs. Directly, \nit will reduce travel time and transport costs, and improve road safety. It \nwill  offer  higher  prices  for  agricultural  products  and  lower  prices  for \nimports.  Improved  access  will  encourage  commercial  activities  among \nrural  communities  and  the  country's  capital,  Dushanbe,  elevating  the \nwelfare  of  communities,  businesses,  and  people.  It  will  support  public \nservice delivery along the corridor, and thereby assist the poor, women, \nand children.  \n \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSupplementary finance is prompted by traffic and trade increases, and \nnot by technical and maintenance flaws. Traffic and trade growth have \nsurpassed  forecasts,  and  the  excess  traffic  has  led  to  premature \ndeterioration of the project corridor. The Project was under-designed to \nmeet  current  traffic  needs  and  future  demands\u2014the  cost  of  success \nwas  underestimated.  Left  as  it  is,  the  road  quality  will  continue  to \ndeteriorate. Ultimately, this will result in higher investment costs.  \n \nSupplementary finance is opportune to (i) close technical and financial \ngaps  resulting  from  the  excess  deterioration,  (ii)  reflect  cost  effective \ndesign  and  best  practice  solution  by  updating  the  outdated  project \nassumptions,  (iii) extend  the  economic  life  of  the  project  corridor,  and \n(iv) augment  the  Project\u2019s  development  impacts.  The  Project,  with \nadditional activities, remains timely and feasible.  \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  Supplementary  finance  complements  the  Project's  impact  of  restoring \nan  integrated  and  efficient  regional  road  transport  and  trade  link.  Its \noutcome is improved access to markets and social services.  \n \nThe  incremental  cost  is  estimated  at  $25  million,  including  taxes  and \nduties, as well as physical and price contingencies. \n \n\n \nInvestment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nRevised Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nBase \nProject \n30.0 \n9.5 \n39.5 \n\nAmounts \nNew \nFinancing \n20.0 \n5.0 \n25.0 \n\nTotal \n\n50.0 \n14.5 \n64.5 \n\n \n \n \n\n \nADB  will  extend  a  supplementary  grant  of  $20  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources.

This  will  match  the  scope  to \nexisting  and  projected  traffic  volumes,  and  safeguard  the  project \nbenefits.  Additional  works  will  generate  300  semi-skilled  and  unskilled \njobs during implementation.  \n \nThe revised economic internal rate of return is 25%, up from the original \n15%, so the supplementary grant guarantees project viability. Although \nthere are fewer project risks, insufficient maintenance after completion, \ninadequate  contractor  performance  (quality  of  works,  and  budget  and \ntime  consciousness),  and  weak  safeguards  management  remain  key \nconcerns.  \n \nThese will be counteracted by (i) monitoring maintenance of the project \ncorridor  after  completion\u2014often  the  cause  of  project  failure;  and  (ii) \noverseeing  contractor  and  consultant  performance  regularly.  ADB  will \nexamine  disbursement  targets  against  physical  progress,  and  begin \nevaluating  results  early  during  implementation.  Tajikistan  Resident \nMission  and  headquarters  staff  will  join  to  follow  up  on  agreed \nschedules and quality of deliverables, and report to ADB Management. \nAdditional safeguard inputs will help ensure safeguard compliance.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nMAP \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  grant  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nRehabilitation Project (Phase II).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nEXISTING PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n2. \nThe Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road (the corridor) is an integral part of the regional road \nnetwork  in  Central  Asia\u2014connecting  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  This  corridor  connects  with \nPakistan\u2019s ocean ports to the south, and the Russian Federation to the north. Landlocked and \nmountainous,  the  corridor  offers  access  to  regional  markets  and  economic  opportunities.  The \n2007  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation \nStrategy2 recognized the corridor\u2019s importance, and classified it as Transport Corridors 3 and 5. \nIts  implementation  action  plan  prioritized  the  corridor.  Despite  its  significance,  Tajikistan  is \nfiscally  constrained  from  improving  the  corridor and  suffers losing  key  road  infrastructure  from \nlack  of  maintenance  and  funds.  Consequently,  the  poor  condition  of  the  corridor  undermines \nTajikistan\u2019s potential for regional trade and growth.  \n \n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  multilateral  financial  institution \nsupporting  road  infrastructure  in  Tajikistan.  ADB\u2019s  phased  financial  assistance  for  the  corridor \nused the Asian Development Fund (ADF) annual allocation for Tajikistan. Three projects were \nprepared:  (i)  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  Phase  I  (Phase  1);3 \n(ii) the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  Phase  II  (the  original  Project); \nand  (iii) the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project  (Phase  3).4 These  projects \ncover 350 kilometers (km) of the corridor and 137 km of rural roads. Phase 1 was completed in \n2008 and the other two are still active. They lead to better use of Tajikistan's strategic location \nand road networks for regional trade, and reap direct benefits (reduced transport and time costs) \nfrom  improved  connectivity.  They  also  help  reform  institutions,  secure  road  maintenance \nbudgets, and develop capacity for optimal road operations.  \n \n4. \nThe Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project, Phase II (the original Project \nand  the  project  road)  is  the  only  substantial  link  between  Rasht  Valley  in  Tajikistan  and  the \ncapital, Dushanbe. Heavy fighting in the Rasht Valley during the 1992\u20131997 civil conflict caused \na  poverty  incidence  higher  than  the  national  average.  The  project  area  produced  agricultural \nproducts for sale to the former Soviet Union but sales declined substantially after independence. \nThis was partly because of the project road\u2019s poor condition, as it obstructed regional trade and \ndomestic  commercial  activities.  Improved  access  from  the  original  Project  offers  higher  prices \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Only  the  works  on  the  central \nsection of the project road are behind schedule. \n \n9. \n \n\nRoad Improvement. Civil works are divided into three sections:  \n\nCentral section. The contract of $24.6 million was awarded on 17 January 2007 \nand  about  40%  of  civil  works  were  completed  by  May  2009.  Contractor \nmobilization was slow, but has since accelerated. \n\nBorder  section.  The  contract  of  $1.17  million  was  awarded  on  4  August  2008 \nand about 70% of civil works were completed by May 2009. Landslide mitigation \nworks are expected to be completed on time. \n\n(iii) \n\nRural roads. Implementation is on schedule. Two contracts totaling $0.69 million \nwere awarded on 16 April 2008 and about 60% of the total has been disbursed.  \n\n \n10. \nRoad  Network  Sustainability.  MOTC,  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  requested  to \npostpone procuring road maintenance and vehicle weighing equipment until most of the project \nworks were completed. Procurement is expected to be completed by November 2009. \n \n11. \nConsulting Services. These include (i) construction supervision, (ii) institutional support \nto  MOTC\u2019s  Accounting  Department,  (iii)  project  auditing,  and  (iv)  HIV/AIDS  awareness.  All \nconsulting services outputs are expected to be delivered on time. \n \n12. \nImplementation. Civil works of the central section have lagged behind schedule, mainly \nbecause  of  poor  work  planning  by  the  contractor  and  inadequate  supervision  from  the \nconsultants.  In  addition,  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  under  MOTC  has  (i)  a  heavy \nworkload with several simultaneous projects; (ii) difficulties retaining competent staff because of \nlow government wages, despite demanding workload and responsibility; and (iii) weak contract \nimplementation  of  ADB\u2019s  social  and \nadministration \nenvironmental  safeguards  policies  remains  a  concern.  Complaints  were  received  while \nimplementing  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  Due  diligence  works  in  November \n2008  and  March  2009  concluded  that  no  irregularity  occurred  in  compensating  affected \npersons.5 The complaints were mostly from (i) miscommunication between the PIU and affected \npersons,  (ii) misunderstanding  of  ADB's  safeguard  policies  and  the  original  Project,  and  (iii) \nmissing information and data. Deficient implementation of the environmental management plan \n(EMP)  was  caused  by  the  PIU\u2019s  lack  of  environmental  expertise  and  consultants  inadequate \nsupervision of contractors. \n \n\nlarge  projects.  Lastly,  weak \n\nfor \n\nIII. \n\nSUPPLEMENTARY GRANT \n\nProposed Changes and Rationale \n\nThe supplementary grant will expand the original project scope as follows:  \n\n                                                 \n5\n\nFinnroad. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Produced-Under-Loans/38236/38236-TAJ-DPL.pdf \n\nAcquisition \n\n2009. \n\nLand \n\nand  Resettlement  Complaint  Due  Diligence  Report.              \n\n \nA. \n\n13. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nAncillary  works. These entail scaled up works beyond the original Project. The \n77 km central section (km 140\u2013km 217) and the 9 km6 border section at Karamik \n(km 337\u2013km 346) will be upgraded. \n\n(a)  Central section. Three major additional activities are (i) pavement upgrading \nof  the  km  140\u2013km  150  section;  (ii)  additional  earthworks  on  the  km  177\u2013\nkm 180 section; and (iii) additional quantities to cover widened technical gaps \nof  the  initial  designs  for  pavement,  drainage,  structural,  and  road  safety  on \nvarious project road sections. Excess traffic growth has triggered premature \ndeterioration and consequent additional quantities and pavement upgrade. \n\n \n(b)  Border section. The ancillary works involve upgrading the pavement design. \nThis  section  is  a  geologically  hazardous  landslide  area,  and  the  original \nProject  covered  landslide  mitigation  works.  Intensified  cross-border  and \ntransit traffic now calls for improved surface treatment.  \n\n(ii) \n\nNew  road  sections.  These  are  the  41  km7 from  Obigarm  to  Nurobad  (km  95\u2013\nkm 140) and the 7 km emergency bypass road (km 110\u2013km 112). These sections \nwere not included in the original project scope, but they were part of the earlier \nPhase  1.  ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguards  requirements  were  fully \nmet under Phase 1. \n\n(a)  Km  95\u2013km  140  section.  Works  required  are  upgrading  of  pavement, \ndrainage,  and  road  safety.  A  potential  hydropower  development  project \nlimited the Phase 1 work scope (minor repair) for the section, which assumed \ncompletion  of  the  hydropower  plant  by  2010.  This  is  now  less  relevant \n(para.14),  while  the  current  traffic  volume  demands  pavement  upgrading.  If \nnot, this section will continue to be a missing link along the corridor.        \n\n \n(b)  Emergency  bypass  road.  These  works  are  improvement  of  drainage, \nearthworks, and road safety. The km 110\u2013km 112 section of the project road \nis  highly  prone  to  rock  fall  and  landslide.  The  bypass  road  warrants \nalternative  access  for  emergencies  (major  blockages).  This  road  underwent \nminor repairs (pothole patching and cleaning) under Phase 1. However, steep \ngrades and deficient drainage remain major safety concerns.    \n\n \nRationale. The original project road sections deteriorated faster than expected because \n14. \nof  the  conservative  assumptions  and  designs,  the  underestimated  costs  of  success  from  the \nearlier  project  (Phase  1),  and  frequent  natural  disasters  during  implementation  (Appendix  5).  \nThese  factors  have  resulted  in  widened  technical  gaps  between  the  original  design \nspecifications  and  needed  works.  Most  importantly,  the  impact  of  a  nearby  hydropower \ndevelopment  project  was  removed  from  the  original  project  assumption.  Because  of  its \ninvestment size, resettlement impacts, construction period, and macroeconomic prospects, the \nhydropower project will not materialize in the medium term.8 Therefore, the project road will be \nunaffected.  The  Government  and  ADB  determined  that  the  initial  designs  do  not  meet  current \n\n                                                 \n6  The length of the border section has been revised to 9 km from the original estimate of 12 km. \n7  Of this, 4 km is good condition with asphalt pavement. \n8   The  Government  confirmed  that  the  hydropower  development  project  will  not  impact  the  project  corridor  in  the \n\nmedium term in a letter dated 21 April 2009. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nand future traffic requirements and minimum safety standards, and there is sufficient economic \njustification to upgrade the original design.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe supplementary grant will expand the original Project, reinforcing its initial impact and \noutcome. The original Project contributes to an integrated and efficient regional road transport \nand trade link (impact), and leads to improved access to market and social services (outcome).  \nThe  expanded  Project  reflects  cost  effective  design  and  best  practice  solution  to  bridge \ntechnical  gaps  and  extend  the  project  road\u2019s  economic  life.  A  revised  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nEligibility \n\nThe  supplementary  grant  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Supplementary  Financing.9 It \n16. \nmeets the eligibility criteria of (i) financing a modified scope and activities as part of operation \nrestructuring  caused  by  unanticipated  circumstances  and  needs  during  implementation,  (ii)  a \nperforming  existing  project,  and  (iii)  according  high  government  priority  and  aligning  ADB\u2019s \nstrategies  for  Tajikistan  and  CAREC.  The  expanded  Project  does  not  materially  alter  the \npurpose of the original Project. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Costs \n\n17. \nThe  new  investment  will  cost  $25 million,  including  taxes  and  duties, and  physical  and \nprice  contingencies  (Table  3).  The  revised  total  project  cost  is  $64.5  million.  Detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n\nTable 3: Revised Costs \n($ million) \n\nItem \nCivil Works \nProject Management and Consulting Services \nTaxes and duties \n\nSubtotal \n\nContingencies \nFinancing Charges During Implementation \nTotal Project Cost \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nNew Financing Plan \n\nBase  \nCosts \n23.6 \n3.0 \n5.9 \n32.5 \n6.4 \n0.6 \n39.5 \n\nAdditional \nCosts \n16.0 \n0.8 \n4.0 \n20.8 \n4.2 \n0.0 \n25.0 \n\nTotal \n39.6 \n3.8 \n9.9 \n53.3 \n10.6 \n0.6 \n64.5 \n\nADB will provide a grant of $20 million from its Special Funds resources to help finance \n\n18. \nadditional works.

The \noriginal project schedules, milestones, and costs will be monitored regularly. The EA will work \nwith  contractors,  consultants,  and  ADB  on  the  construction  work  program,  performance,  and \noutputs. Contractors and consultants have since stepped up works on the central section. At the \nsame time, ADB will examine disbursement targets against actual physical progress, and begin \nevaluating  results  early  during  implementation  of  the  original  Project  as  well  as  the  additional \nworks.  Tajikistan  Resident  Mission  and  headquarters  staff  will  join  to  follow  up  on  agreed \nschedules and quality of deliverables, and report to ADB Management.  \n \n20. \nPhasing  works  under  three  distinct  projects  (Phase  1,  original  Project,  and  Phase  3) \nhave been advantageous\u2014better contract supervision and cost control as well as manageable \nworks\u2014but  have  duplicated  supervision  consultants\u2019  inputs  in  administration  works.  Multiple \ncontracts  implemented  simultaneously  require  more  coordination  and  administrative  oversight. \nFor the additional works, four PIU staff will be added to bolster its oversight function (para. 21). \nThe key remedial features are efficient contracting strategies. A contract variation is envisaged \nto  be  issued  to  the  supervision  consultants  currently  implementing  Phase  3  to  oversee  the \nadditional works to minimize overlapping consultant services. Civil works will use a combination \nof  methods:  (i)  ancillary  works  (central  and  border  section  of  the  original  Project)  will  use \nexisting contract(s) of the original Project and/or Phase 3, where feasible, to minimize the initial \nconstraints  of  a  slow  start-up  and  delayed  contractor  mobilization  imposed  on  the  original \nProject; and (ii) new road sections will use standard competitive bidding as they entail separate \nworks and do not depend on the ongoing works of the original Project. Advance contracting and \nretroactive financing have been approved to accelerate preparation works.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n21.  MOTC will remain the EA. The PIU under MOTC will remain responsible for day-to-day \nproject  management,  preparing  withdrawal  applications  and  progress  reports,  and  maintaining \nproject  accounts  and  financial  records.  The  PIU  has  four  full-time  staff  (two  engineers, \na procurement  specialist,  and  an  accountant)  working  under  the  original  Project.  Before \nawarding additional civil works contract, four additional staff will be recruited (a road engineer, a \nprocurement  specialist,  a  safeguards  specialist,  and  a  translator).  This  will  reduce  the  current \nheavy workloads and strengthen the oversight function (paras. 12 and 20). \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  30  months.  Civil  works  will  be  completed  by \n\n \n22. \n31 December 2011. A revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n23. \nAll  procurement  under  the  supplementary  grant  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The new sections (the km 95\u2013km 140 section \nand emergency bypass road) have separate work scopes and are not affected by the ongoing \nworks  of  the  original  Project.  The  km  95\u2013km  140  section  will  use  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB) for civil works contracts above $1 million, and the emergency bypass road section \nwill use national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works contracts $1 million or less. NCB will \nbe  under  the  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  on  Public  Procurement  of  Goods,  Works  and \nServices  (3  March  2006),  subject  to  the  clarifications  and  modifications  agreed  with  ADB  and \nindicated in section II of the procurement plan (Appendix 3). The EA will update it, as necessary. \nThe  ancillary  works  are  proposed  to  be  incorporated  in  the  existing  contracts  of  the  original \nProject and/or Phase 3 (either one or both) since they represent a natural extension of an earlier \nor ongoing job. The contractors from the original Project and Phase 3 have been engaged under \nICB procedures and initially indicated keen interest in the additional works opportunities. This is \nthe most expeditious, economical, and efficient option under the circumstances, and will ensure \ncontinuity  of  works  as  well  as  adherence  to  existing  implementation  schedules.  Furthermore, \ncontinuation of the civil works engagement will ensure a compatible quality of works, and timely \nand  seamless  work  coordination.  The  procurement  plans  of  the  respective  projects  will  be \nupdated  to  reflect  contract  variation(s)  of  the  original  Project  and/or  Phase  3  contracts  upon \napproval  of  variation(s)  by  ADB.  The  decision  to  which  extent  the  additional  works  of  the \nsupplementary grant will be incorporated into existing contracts under the original Project and/or \nPhase  3  will  be  based  on  the  contractors\u2019  earlier  and/or  ongoing  performance,  workmanship, \nresources,  capacity,  and  interests  to  take  on  the  additional  works.  In  case  of  failed  contract \nvariation(s) under both projects (the original Project and Phase 3), procurement of the ancillary \nworks may follow competitive bidding procedures. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n24. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Incremental consulting services inputs are \nconstruction  supervision  and  project  auditing.  Construction supervision consulting  services  will \nbe  carried  out  over  18  months,  requiring  18  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs \nand  126 person-months  of  national  consultant  inputs.  It  is  envisaged  to  issue  a  contract \nvariation  to  the  supervision  consultants  currently  implementing  Phase  3  to  gradually  oversee \nand supervise the additional works to minimize duplication of consultant inputs, and to ensure \nefficiency and timely delivery. The expected additional tasks of the Phase 3 consultant clearly \nrepresent a continuation of previous and ongoing works, and it was engaged under quality and \ncost-based  selection  using  full  technical  proposals  in  2008.  Positive  feedback  has  been \nreceived  from  Phase  3  supervision  consultants  taking  on  additional  works.  This  approach  will \n(i) ensure  seamless  coordination,  technical  consistency,  and  oversight  continuity;  (ii) minimize \noverlapping consulting inputs, costs, and liability risks; (iii) reduce the mobilization period; and \n(iv) simplify  and  streamline  ongoing  ADB-financed  project  supervision  for  the  project  corridor. \nThis option will only be used if the Phase 3 supervision consultant has shown solid performance \nthroughout its engagement, and can demonstrate access to sufficient resources and capacity to \nmanage  additional  supervision  works  under  the  original  Project;  and  on  the  condition  that \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ncontract  negotiations  for  the  additional  works  are  concluded  successfully.  Other  consultant \nselection  methods  may  be  used  if  the  Phase  3  supervision  consultant  does  not  meet  the \nminimum  requirements  and/or  in  case  of  a  failed  contract  variation(s).  The  draft  terms  of \nreference  for  construction  supervision  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A. \nLeast cost selection will be used for recruiting project auditing services. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nThe  Government  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing,  which  ADB \n25. \napproved  on  29  April  2009.  Up  to  20%  of  the  proceeds  of  the  supplementary  grant  will  be \neligible  for  retroactive  financing  for  ongoing  and  awarded  contracts  under  the  original  Project, \nprovided  that  eligible  expenditures  on  works  and  consulting  services  follow  the  agreed \nprocedures and were incurred before grant effectiveness within 12 months of the grant signing. \nHowever, this approval does not commit ADB to provide the supplementary grant. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, MOTC, and the PIU. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the additional \nworks  financed  by  the  supplementary  grant.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of \nADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  supplementary  grant  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe EA, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe supplementary grant. \n \n\n7. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n27. \nThe EA will manage the flow of funds, accounting, reporting, and auditing. The financial \nmanagement assessment of the EA was conducted under the original Project and was found to \nbe  acceptable.  Its  accounting  department  is  being  improved  under  the  original  Project  since \n26 January 2009. Activities include (i) strengthening the accounting and finance functions of the \nHead  Office  of  MOTC;  (ii)  designing  and  implementing  a  manual  for  monitoring  ADB-financed \nprojects in the Finance and Accounting Division of MOTC; (iii) procuring computer and network \nequipment  for  the  automation  of  financial  and  management  reporting  systems  in  MOTC; \n(iv) defining  the  role,  responsibilities,  and  organization  structure  of  the  proposed  internal  audit \nfunction  in  MOTC;  and  (v)  designing  and  delivering  training  to  finance  and  accounting  staff  of \nMOTC.  The  activities  are  consistent  with  the  recommendation  under  the  Phase  3  financial \nmanagement assessment report.1  \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  supplementary  grant  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n28. \nHandbook  (2007, as amended from time to time). The disbursement arrangements agreed for \nthe  original  Project  will  be  retained.  A  separate  imprest  account  will  be  established  promptly \n\n                                                 \n1   Supplementary  Appendix  E  under  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and  Asian  Development  Fund  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  CAREC \nRegional Road Corridor Improvement Project (Loan 2359-TAJ) Manila. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nafter grant effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be managed by the \nEA. The initial advance to the imprest account is not to exceed $500,000. Total advances are \nnot to exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through \nthe  imprest  account  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  supplementary  grant  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and \nreplenishment  of  the  imprest  account(s)  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  full  supporting \ndocumentation. For civil works contracts, direct payment procedures will apply.   \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  EA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on \n29. \nimplementation.  These  reports  will  indicate  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during \nthe  review  periods,  steps  taken  to  remedy  the  problems  or  proposed  countermeasures,  the \nproposed activities, and expected progress during the following periods. One project completion \nreport  will  be  required  for  the  original  Project  and  additional  works  financed  by  the \nsupplementary  grant.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  supplementary  grant, \nMOTC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  combined  project  completion  report  of  the  original  Project  and \nadditional  works  of  the  supplementary  grant.  The  submission  date  and  report  contents  will  be \ncoordinated with the original Project for simplification and further consolidation. \n \n30. \nThe  EA  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  additional  works  of  the  supplementary \ngrant financed by ADB and the Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports\u2014including separate \nopinion on the use of the fund proceeds, grant compliance, imprest account, and the statement \nof expenditure procedures\u2014will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear. These need to be submitted together with those of the original Project. The Government \nwas informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure to submit \naudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  due  dates.  If  submission  of  an  audited  project \naccounts  is  delayed  by  more  than  6  months  (i)  a  no  commitment  letter  will  be  issued,  if \napplicable;  and  (ii)  ADB  may  not  approve  new  contract  awards.  If  the  delay  is  more  than \n12 months, fund disbursements may be suspended or the funds may be canceled. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe EA has a project performance monitoring system for impacts, outcome, outputs, and \n31. \nactivities, which has been updated (Appendix 1). The EA and ADB agreed baseline indicators \ncovering  the  economic,  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  under  the  original \nProject. These will be updated, monitored, and reported quarterly. \n \n\n11. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\n \n32. \nDue  diligence  was  carried  out  during  preparation  and  implementation\u2014covering \ntechnical,  social,  and  safeguards  issues.  Nongovernment  organizations  and  affected  local \ncommunities were engaged during the process. Regular consultations are being carried out at \nthe higher institutional level, including governments and external aid agencies. \n \n\n \n\n\fReviews \n\n12. \n \n33. \nADB  will  combine  review  of  the  original  Project  and  the  additional  works  of  the \nsupplementary grant. To ensure timely and effective implementation, at least three reviews will \nbe undertaken annually. The EA will monitor implementation and inform ADB promptly of major \nproblems that may result in the target schedule not being met. One project completion report will \nbe  required after  the closing  of  the supplementary  grant  (para.  29).  ADB  will  field  a  combined \nproject completion review mission upon completion of the additional works. \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n34. \nThe  original  project  economic  analysis  remains  valid,  although  adjustments  have  been \nmade  to  reflect  additional  investment  costs.  These  extra  costs  deliver  added  benefits  and \nsafeguard investments made so far. They correct technical gaps and reinforce the delivery of all \noutputs.  Accordingly,  the  new  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  increased  to  25%\u2014up \nfrom  15%.  The  EIRR  is  highly  sensitive  to  traffic  and  trade  forecasts,  and  less  responsive  to \nincreased investment and operating costs (Appendix 5). \n \nB. \n\nSustainability \n\n35. \nThe  Government  has  kept  its  commitment  on  its  road  maintenance  budget.  The  road \nmaintenance budget increased at an average annual growth of 18% from TJS13 million in 2004 \nto TJS31 million in 2009. The actual amount disbursed increased from TJS13 million in 2004 to \nTJS27 million in 2008. A separate maintenance budget will be retained after the supplementary \ngrant  approval  and  $200,000  will  be  made  available  annually  for  the  project  road.  ADB  will \ncontinue  to  engage  the  Government  to  increase  road  maintenance  financing  to  the  extent \npossible given its fiscal constraints and the national priority projects. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nThe  additional  works  of  the  supplementary  grant  are  classified  category  C,  and  the \n36. \noriginal Project category B. The additional works are not environmentally sensitive, and will not \nentail  significant  environmental  impacts.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared for Phase 1 (new sections) and the original Project (ancillary works), and uploaded to \nADB\u2019s website. The EMP included in each IEE outlines mitigation measures, monitoring actions, \nand capacity building. The EMP will be part of the contract documents and will be monitored by \nsupervision consultants and the EA. \n \nD. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n37. \nThe project area is primarily agricultural and unemployment is high. The additional works \nwill  generate  employment\u2014300  new  unskilled  and  semi-skilled  jobs  will  be  created,  and \nencourage  hiring  of  poor  people  from  the  project  area.  The  original  Project  directly  benefits \nabout 180,000 people in 26 districts and 120,000 poor villagers residing adjacent to the project \nroad. The project road connects Tajikistan to international markets as well as local markets in \nbetween,  opening  up  economic  opportunities  for  communities,  businesses,  and  people.  With \nless  transport  costs  and  time,  a  higher  value  for  agricultural  products  is  warranted.  Moreover, \nthe  original  Project  is  improving  rural  roads  to  connect  rural  villages  to  the  project  road. \nImproved rural access, through better public service delivery and road safety, benefit vulnerable \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ngroups (the poor, women, and children) and rural communities. Women benefit directly through \nthe  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program  implemented  under  the  original  Project,  targeting  local \ncommunities and high-risk groups. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n38. \nThe  resettlement  impact  is  limited.  The  additional  works  will  take  place  within  the \nexisting  right-of-way.  They  do  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  A  short  resettlement \nplan has been prepared for the original Project. No resettlement impact is envisaged for the new \nsections (para 13 [ii]). \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n39. \nThe  main  risks  are  (i)  insufficient  maintenance  after  completion;  (ii)  inadequate \ncontractor  performance  (quality  of  works,  and  budget  and  time  consciousness);  and  (iii)  weak \nsafeguards  management.  The  risks  are  manageable.  These  will  be  counteracted  by  (i) \nmonitoring  maintenance  of  the  project  corridor  after  completion\u2014often  the  cause  of  project \nfailure;  and  (ii)  overseeing  contractor  and  consultant  performance  regularly.  ADB  will  examine \ndisbursement  targets  against  physical  progress,  and  begin  evaluating  results  early  during \nimplementation.  Tajikistan  Resident  Mission  and  headquarters  staff  will  join  to  follow  up  on \nagreed  schedules  and  quality  of  deliverables,  and  report  to  ADB  Management.  Additional \nsafeguard inputs will help ensure safeguard compliance.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n40. \nIn addition to the specific covenants in the Financing Agreements (Special Operations) \nunder  the  original  Project,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are \nincorporated in the legal document. Variations from the original Financing Agreements are listed \nbelow. \n \n41.  Maintenance  Financing.  The  Government  will  annually  allocate  additional  $200,0002 \n(plus inflation since 2009) for maintenance of new road sections. The Government will ensure \nthat  actual  annual  expenditures  for  road  maintenance  (including  emergency  maintenance,  but \nexcluding rehabilitation and construction) for roads under MOTC jurisdiction are increased at the \nsame rate as increases in the overall national budget during 2009\u20132011. \n \n42. \nsix (6) months from the end of the fiscal year during implementation. \n \n43. \nSafeguard  Unit.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  permanent  safeguard  unit \ninstitutionalized within the PIU is adequately staffed and equipped to enable it to review, audit, \nand  monitor  safeguard  implementation,  and  that  it  submits  a  monitoring  report  every \nsix (6) months to ADB and to relevant governmental agencies through the EA. \n \n44. \n \n\nAuditing.  The  Government  will  submit  audited  project  accounts  to  ADB  within \n\nEnvironment.

For  consistency,  the  original  Project\u2019s \nmethodology  was  used  to  recalculate  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  original \nProject\u2019s  assumptions  were  reexamined  and  updated\u2014gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth, \nnormal  traffic,  domestic  generated  and  international  generated  traffic,  and  growth  rate  per \nvehicle type. The revised economic analysis covers 23 years (2007\u20132029), based on a 6-year \nimplementation  period.  All  figures  were  translated  into  2009  constant  prices.  Actual  costs  to \nMarch  2009  were  incorporated,  and  projected  annual  costs  were  extrapolated  based  on \nestimated  disbursement  profile.  They  were  converted  to  economic  costs  using  world  price \nnumeraire.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  were \nexcluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to non-tradables. The assumption on \nthe potential hydropower development project near the project area, which limited the pavement \ndesign on km 95\u2013km 150 (Phase 1 scope, including 10 kilometers of the original Project), was \nremoved.  \n \n2. \nThe  original  Project\u2019s  economic  analysis  remains  valid.  The  additional  costs  deliver \nadded  benefits,  and  safeguard  investments  made  so  far.  The  supplementary  grant  corrects \ntechnical gaps and reinforces the delivery of all outputs. Accordingly, the new EIRR increased to \n25%\u2014up  from  15%.  The  EIRR  is  highly  sensitive  to  traffic  and  trade  forecasts,  and  less \nresponsive to increased investment and operating costs.  \n \nB. \n\nRevised Assumptions \n\n3. \nThe  original  Project\u2019s  assumptions  were  revisited,  and  its  summary  is  highlighted  in \nTable A5.1. The findings confirm the original Project\u2019s conservative assumptions, resulting in a \nconservative design for the project road. Frequent and severe seismic activities incurred on the \nproject road after the original Project's contract awards worsened premature road deterioration.   \n \n\nTable A5.1: Assumptions versus Actual Comparison \n\n \n\nDomestic Traffic \nBase traffic level (vehicle per day) \n   Central section \n   Border section \n   Rural roads \nReal GDP growth (%) \nBase growth rate for 2004\u20132008a (%) \n   Cars \n   Buses \n   Trucks \nBase growth rate for 2009\u20132029 (%) \n   Cars \n   Buses \n   Trucks \nGrowth on year after Phase 1 completion (%) \nGrowth on year after Phase 2 completion (%) \n \n\n \n\nOriginal Project \n(2008 estimates) \n \n716 (580 in 2004) \n29 (20 in 2004) \n31 (25 in 2004) \n6 \n \n6 \n5 \n6.5 \n \n6 \n5 \n6.5 \n10 \n10 \n\nRevised \n(2008 actual) \n \n1,300 \n150 \n50 \n7.9 \n \n16 \n3 \n0 \n \n10 \n3 \n3 \n20 \n20 \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nInternational Traffic \nTajikistan\u2013PRC trade market share \n\nAfghanistan\u2013PRC trade market share \n\nOriginal Project \n(2008 estimates) \n1.9% in 2004 \n20% from 2015 \n0.04% in 2004 \n10% from 2015 \n2015 \n15.4% \n\nRevised \n(2008 actual) \n20.3% in 2007 \n\n11% in 2007 \n \n2007 \n24.9% \n\nEquilibrium year \nEIRR overall (including rural roads) \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, GDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People's Republic of China. \na Based on number of new vehicle registered. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nActual  2008  traffic  volume,  real  GDP,  and  trade  volume  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \n4. \nChina  (PRC)  exceeded  the  original  Project\u2019s  projection  for  the  year.  The  2004\u20132008  average \nreal GDP growth in Tajikistan was 8.2% per annum. Traffic volume on the project road reached \nits pre-1990 level (at its peak) in 2008, and the completed Phase 1 significantly contributed to \nthe  increase  in  domestic  generated  traffic  on  Phase  2  road  sections.  The  PRC  economy  also \ngrew  remarkably,  at  an  annual  growth  of  over  15%  in  current  prices  during  the  same  period \n(2004\u20132008). Trade with the PRC is crucial for Tajikistan economy with imports from the PRC \ndominating  Tajikistan  market.  This  is  illustrated  by  a  substantial  increase  of  bilateral  trade  in \nvalue  terms,1 at  an  average  growth  of  70%  per  annum.  The  original  Project  assumed  that  the \nPRC\u2019s share of trade with Tajikistan would increase from 2% in 2004 to 20% in 2015. This 20% \nbenchmark market share was outstripped in 2007. The revised assumption includes continuing \nrapid growth for 2007\u20132010, but declining from 65% per year in 2008 to a more modest 20% per \nyear  in  2010.  A  moderate  increase  in  the  projected  traffic  level  reflects  the  slowing  domestic \neconomy  in  2009\u20132010,  although  border  traffic  remains  strong  (Table  A5.2).  PRC\u2013Tajik  trade \nwill  generate  traffic  of  115 vehicles  per  day  in  2010,  growing  nearly  ten-fold  to  about  1,080 \nvehicles per day in 2029. \n  \n\nTable A5.2: Traffic Counts and Projection \n(vehicles per day) \nActual \n\n \n\n2008 \n1,789 \n1,306 \n332 \n\n \n \n\nProjected \n\n2009 \n1,874 \n1,437 \n473 \n\n2010 \n1,965 \n1,481 \n650 \n\nRoad section \nKm 95\u2013140 \nCentral section (km 140\u2013217)  \nBorder section (km 337\u2013346)  \n km = kilometer.       \n Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications. \n \nC. \n\n2007 \n1,572 \n1,171 \n150 \n\nResults \n\n5. \nOverall,  the  Project  (the  original  Project  and  additional  works)  remains  economically \nviable,  despite  additional  costs.  The  new  EIRR  is  24.9%,  up  from  15.4%.  The  economic  net \npresent  value  is  $56.4  million,  up  from  $9.8  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate  (Table  A5.3). \nSensitivity  analysis  (Table  A5.4)  indicated  that  the  EIRR  is  highly  sensitive  to  domestic  traffic \nincreases, and less responsive to changes in capital and maintenance costs, and international \ngenerated traffic.2 This is consistent with the escalated EIRR from that of the original Project. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  The total bilateral trade was valued at $324 million in 2006\u2014up 105% on the previous year. \n2  Economic benefits from international generated traffic are shared  with Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the \n\nPRC.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n23\n\nTable A5.3: Revised Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \n\n \n \n\nCosts \n\nCapital  Maintenance  Total  Normal Domestic \nCosts\nTraffic  Generated\n4.76 \n6.44 \n7.85 \n15.71 \n16.61 \n3.89 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n0.90 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n0.90 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n1.80 \n\n \nYear  Costs \n4.76 \n2007 \n6.44 \n2008 \n2009 \n7.85 \n2010  15.71 \n2011  15.71 \n2.09 \n2012 \n0.00 \n2013 \n0.00 \n2014 \n0.00 \n2015 \n0.00 \n2016 \n0.00 \n2017 \n0.00 \n2018 \n0.00 \n2019 \n0.00 \n2020 \n0.00 \n2021 \n0.00 \n2022 \n0.00 \n2023 \n0.00 \n2024 \n0.00 \n2025 \n0.00 \n2026 \n0.00 \n2027 \n0.00 \n2028 \n2029 \n0.00 \n \n \n \n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n3.39 \n3.98 \n5.71 \n6.58 \n7.63 \n8.86 \n10.36 \n12.00 \n13.99 \n16.40 \n19.35 \n23.05 \n27.23 \n30.72 \n34.02 \n37.06 \n40.06 \n42.73 \n45.48 \n48.24 \n51.31 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.14 \n0.21 \n0.24 \n0.27 \n0.31 \n0.36 \n0.42 \n0.49 \n0.58 \n0.68 \n0.81 \n0.97 \n1.11 \n1.23 \n1.35 \n1.47 \n1.58 \n1.69 \n1.80 \n1.92 \n\n0.90 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n0.90 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n0.90 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n1.80 \n6.30 \n1.80 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nInternational Rural \n\nTotal \n\nNet \n\nGenerated  Roads  Benefits Benefits\n(4.76) \n(6.44) \n(4.27) \n(10.93) \n(9.76) \n4.11 \n7.57 \n9.17 \n11.08 \n8.52 \n16.27 \n18.21 \n21.67 \n25.99 \n30.86 \n30.46 \n39.74 \n42.40 \n45.93 \n49.09 \n52.34 \n51.07 \n59.16 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n3.58 \n4.77 \n6.84 \n8.01 \n9.38 \n10.97 \n12.89 \n14.83 \n17.17 \n20.02 \n23.47 \n27.80 \n32.67 \n36.76 \n40.64 \n44.21 \n47.74 \n50.89 \n54.14 \n57.38 \n60.97 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.19 \n0.46 \n0.49 \n0.52 \n0.56 \n0.60 \n0.64 \n0.69 \n0.73 \n0.79 \n0.84 \n0.90 \n0.96 \n1.03 \n1.10 \n1.18 \n1.26 \n1.35 \n1.44 \n1.54 \n1.65 \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.19 \n0.43 \n0.66 \n0.92 \n1.20 \n1.52 \n1.73 \n1.97 \n2.25 \n2.61 \n3.04 \n3.50 \n3.90 \n4.28 \n4.62 \n4.94 \n5.23 \n5.53 \n5.79 \n6.08 \n\n \n \n \n\n \nEIRR \nNPV \n\n \n\n24.9%\n56.44\n\n \nTable A5.4: Sensitivity Analysis \nEIRR  \n(%) \n24.9 \n20.4 \n21.9 \n21.1 \n22.2 \n19.2 \n\nENPV  \n($ million) \n56.4 \n43.9 \n40.7 \n36.9 \n50.3 \n33.7 \n\nItem \nBase case \n1 year implementation delay \nNormal traffic \u201320% \nTotal benefit \u201320% \nCapital cost +20% \nNormal traffic \u201320%; capital costs \n+20% \nInternational generated traffic \u201320% \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n24.5 \n\n54.9 \n\n412 \n\nSwitching Value  \n(%) \n \n \n61 \n53 \n146 \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 29 June 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "TJS1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "somoni (TJS) \n \n$0.2272 \nTJS4.4005 \n", "AADT \nADB \nADF \nCAREC \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nGDP \nICB \nIEE \nMOTC \nNCB \nNPV \nPIU \nPRC \nSDR \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "annual average daily traffic \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan  \ngross domestic product \ninternational competitive bidding  \ninitial environmental examination  \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national competitive bidding \nnet present value  \nproject implementation unit \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nspecial drawing rights \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  and  its  agencies  ends  on \n31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "X.
