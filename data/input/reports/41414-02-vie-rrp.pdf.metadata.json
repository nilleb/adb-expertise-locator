The  executing  agency  is  the  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation \n(VEC),  which  was  established  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  to  develop  the  national \nexpressway  network  in  Viet  Nam.  The  project  expressway  consists  of  a  southern  link  to  the \nplanned  HCMC  Third  Ring  Road  and  an  access  link  to  the  planned  Bien  Hoa\u2013Vung  Tau \nexpressway (see map). The starting point of the project expressway is an interchange with the \nexisting  HCMC-Trung  Luong  expressway,  and  the  ending  point  is  an  interchange  with  the \nplanned Bien Hoa\u2013Vung Tau expressway. The project expressway will be constructed with four \nlanes  and  the  government  will  expand  the  width  to  eight  lanes  when  traffic  demand  reaches \ncapacity.  The  following  six  interchanges  (ICs)  are  planned  under  the  project:  (i)  IC1  with \nHCMC\u2013Trung  Luong  expressway;  (ii)  IC2  with  National  Highway  1A;  (iii)  IC3  with  National \nHighway  50;  (iv) IC4  with  Nguyen  Van  Tao;  (v) IC6  with  Phuoc  An;  and (vi)  IC7  with  National \nHighway  51.  IC5  with  HCMC  Third  Ring  Road  and  IC8  with  Bien  Hoa\u2013Vung  Tau  expressway \nwill  be  constructed  after  the  completion  of  the  Third  Ring  Road  and  the  Bien  Hoa\u2013Vung  Tau \nexpressway.  The  project  expressway  is  divided  into  a  western  section  (19.8  km),  a  middle \nsection (11.0 km), and an eastern section (26.3 km). For the expressway construction, ADB will \nfinance  the  western  and  eastern  sections,  and  a  potential  cofinancier  (Japan)  is  expected  to \nfinance  the  middle  section.  The  project  expressway  will  be  tolled  and  operated  by  VEC.  VEC \nestablished a subsidiary company to operate and maintain the expressways through a public\u2013\nprivate partnership concession arrangement. \n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIn  the  south  of  HCMC,  east\u2013west  traffic  is  restricted  due  to  the  lack  of  river  crossing \n3. \nfacilities,  forcing  vehicles  into  the  center  of  HCMC.  A  substantial  shift  has  occurred  from \nmotorcycles  to  passenger  cars  in  the  project  area,  further  exacerbating  traffic  congestion. \nConstruction  of  HCMC  ring  roads  to  establish  connectivity  with  neighboring  cities  through \nexpressway  links  is  a  high  priority  of  the  government.  In  this  regard,  the  project  will  facilitate \neast\u2013west  traffic  south  of  HCMC,  thereby  diverting  through-traffic  and  reducing  traffic \ncongestion  in  the  center  of  HCMC.  Through  construction  of  the  project  expressway,  the \nconnectivity  of  cities  and  towns  around  HCMC  will  also  be  improved,  and  transport  costs  and \ntravel times for the movement of passengers and goods in and around HCMC will be reduced. \nMoreover, the project expressway is identified as a part of the national north\u2013south expressway \nthat  links  into  the  Mekong  Delta,  which  is  the  rice  basket  of  Asia.  It  will  be  used  as  a  freight \nroute to transport food produced in the Mekong Delta to the rest of the country and overseas via \nland and maritime transport. \n \n4. \nFurthermore, the project will strengthen subregional connectivity and international trade \nwith  the  neighboring  country  of  Cambodia.  Under  the  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement \nbetween  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia,  Viet  Nam  agreed  to  accept  entry  of  150  Cambodian \ncommercial  vehicles  into  Viet  Nam,  and  vice-versa.  For  commercial  vehicles  in  Cambodia, \nimproved  access  to  ports  in  HCMC  will  reduce  freight  cost  and  travel  time,  especially  for \n\n\fcargoes  to  and  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  United  States.  The \ntransport of goods between Cambodia and HCMC through the GMS SEC is constrained by the \nabsence  of  a  Mekong  River  bridge  at  Neak  Laong  in  Cambodia,  as  well  as  the  heavy  traffic \ncongestion around HCMC. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is implementing \nthe  Mekong  River  bridge  project  at  Neak  Laong,  and  the  project  expressway  will  provide  an \nexpress route to and from the ports in HCMC. Therefore, the project expressway, coupled with \nthe  JICA-financed  bridge  project,  is  expected  to  improve  transport  efficiency  in  the  GMS  SEC \nand expand international trade between the two countries.  \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  2007\u20132010  for  Viet  Nam1 aims  to  help  the \n5. \nGovernment of Viet Nam reduce poverty, in accordance with the government\u2019s socioeconomic \ndevelopment  plan, 2\n through  (i)  pro-poor  business-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  social  equity  and \nbalanced development, and (iii) environmental protection and management. The CSP promotes \ngood  governance  and  places  a  high  priority  on  contributing  to  regional  cooperation.  In  light  of \nthe  expected  strong  expansion  of  the  Vietnamese  economy, the  CSP  recognizes  the  need for \naccelerated  improvements  in  infrastructure,  particularly  transportation  and  energy,  and  in \nhuman resource development. \n \n6. \nIn January 2010, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam approved a master plan for 16 north\u2013\nsouth  expressways  along  the  eastern  side  of  Viet  Nam,  including  the  Ben  Luc-Long  Thanh \nExpressway.  The  master  plan  includes  alignment,  technical  standards,  investment  cost, \nconstruction  period,  project  owners,  and  project  financiers  for  each  expressway  project.3\n The \nmaster  plan  will  be  implemented  over  14  years  (from  2010  to  2023);  the  cost  is  estimated  at \nabout $17.9 billion, or about $10 million per km, with an average yearly investment of about $1.3 \nbillion. \n \n7. \nThe MFF is an appropriate modality to finance the project expressway, as a large stand-\nalone project to be implemented under the master plan, for the following reasons: (i) the project \nexpressway is included within the government\u2019s master plan for expressways, which, in addition \nto  ADB\u2019s  assessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  study  for  the  transport  sector,  provides  the \nstrategic  context,  policy  framework,  and  investment  program  for  expressway  development  in \nViet  Nam;  (ii)  the  size  and  cost  of  the  project  expressway  requires  a  phased  approach  to \nconstruction\u2014the  western  section  of  the  expressway  needs  to  be  constructed  immediately \nunder the first tranche, given the rapid urbanization and severe traffic congestion in the west of \nHCMC; (iii) the MFF modality provides for financing flexibility, which is advantageous because a \ncommitment  to  project  financing  by  a  potential  cofinancier  (Japan)  cannot  be  made  in  2010\u2014\ncofinancing arrangements will be made in 2011 and linked to the second tranche; and (iv) the \nMFF  incorporates  a  long-term  structural  reform  program  for  the  road  transport  sector,  defined \nthrough  policy  advisory  technical  assistance  (PATA), 4\n which  aims  to  strengthen  institutional \narrangements, operation and maintenance, and governance, and will develop guidelines for (a) \nefficient  management  of  the  Directorate  for  Roads  in  Viet  Nam  and  Vietnam  Expressway \nManagement  Administration,  (b)  financial  arrangements  of  expressway  projects  and  financial \nempowerment  of  VEC,  (c)  flexible  design  standards,  and  (d)  an  improved  framework  for \ngovernance  of  the  road  sector,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  in  ADB\u2019s  sector \n\n                                                \n1 ADB. 2006.

By  expanding \naccess  to  markets,  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  and  contributing  to \nconnectivity  improvements  in  the  GMS,  the  project  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth \nand regional cooperation. The outcome of the project will be more efficient and safer movement \nof goods and people in the greater HCMC area.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n9. \nThe  project  will  increase  the  density  of  the  HCMC  road  network,  enhance  connectivity \nbetween the eastern and western regions of HCMC, and\u2014coupled with PATA implementation\u2014\nimprove  the  project  management  and  financial  management  capacity  of  VEC.  The  western \nsection of the expressway to be constructed under the first tranche is expected to be completed \nin the middle of 2015, and operation is scheduled for 2016. The entire expressway, including the \neastern  and  middle  sections  to  be  constructed  under  the  second  tranche,  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted in the middle of 2016, with operation scheduled for 2017. \n  \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.608  billion,  inclusive  of  local  taxes,  contingencies, \nand  financing  charges  during  development.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  1. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are \nincluded  in  the  facility  administration  manual  (FAM).  The  project  financing  plan  is  provided  in \nTable  2.  ADB  and  a  potential  cofinancier  (Japan)  will  each  finance  about  40%  of  the  project \ncost, and the counterpart funds will finance about 20% of the project cost. Parallel cofinancing \nbetween  ADB  and  the  cofinancier  is  expected  for  the  second  tranche  of  the  MFF.  Also,  ADB \nprovided TA6 of $1.5 million (funded by the Japan Special Fund) for preparing the project, and a \nTA  loan 7\n of  $27.0  million  for  preparing  detailed  designs  of  three  expressways,  including  the \nproject expressway. \n \nThe  government  has requested  an MFF  in  an  amount  up  to  $636.0 million  from  ADB's \n11. \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  a  part  of  the  project.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  two \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government's  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first \ntranche  of  the  MFF  will  have  a  27-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, the interest and other charges \n\n                                                \n5 ADB. 2009.

The Binh Khanh bridge (across the Soai Rap river) and \nthe  Phuoc  Khanh  bridge  (across  Long  Tau  river)  will  be  cable-stay  bridges  with  a  55-meter \nnavigation clearance, and with central spans of 435 meters and 375 meters, respectively.  \n\n4 \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n\n \n\n\fThe government\u2019s counterpart funds will be used for (i) land acquisition and resettlement \n13. \nfor the entire expressway; (ii) unexploded ordnance clearance works for the entire expressway; \nand (iii) the local taxes to be imposed on the above cofinancing components, because the land \nacquisition and resettlement and the unexploded ordnance clearance works need to start before \nloan  effectiveness,  and  the  local  taxes  are  ineligible  for  payment  by  a  potential  cofinancier \n(Japan).  The  estimated  amount  of  the  counterpart  funds  is  $337.0  million.  The  government \nassures  that  counterpart  funds  will  be  increased  in  case  of  any  shortfall  in  financing.  As  the \ncounterpart  funding  is  about  20%  of  the  total  project  cost,  ADB\u2019s  financing  should  cover  all  of \nthe local taxes imposed on ADB-financed civil works, consulting services, and VEC laboratory in \nthe amount of $44.3 million. This is only 2.8% of the total project cost. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n14. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nFAM.  VEC,  as  the  project  executing  agency,  will  implement  the  project  under  the  oversight  of \nMOT. VEC will establish a Ben Luc-Long Thanh project management unit (BLLT-PMU) that will \nbe  the  focal  point  for  project  coordination  and  communication  with  ADB  and  other  relevant \nagencies  of  the  borrower.  The  BLLT-PMU  will  also  (i)  carry  out  the  procurement  activities,  (ii) \nimplement the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the resettlement plan approved by \nADB,  (iii)  supervise  the  consultants  and  contractors  under  the  project,  (iv)  prepare  the \nnecessary documentations for the withdrawal of loan proceeds, and (v) prepare periodic reports \nto ADB.  \n \n15. \nAll works and consulting services to be financed out of the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe subject to and governed by ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime), and ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe  government  and  a  potential  cofinancier  (Japan)  will  make  their  own  arrangements  for \nprocurement and consultant recruitment. \n \n16. \nExperience  from  ongoing  expressway  projects  in  Viet  Nam  indicates  that  delays  in \npreconstruction activities contribute to project implementation delays. For example, resettlement \nplan  updating  was  delayed  due  to  the  unfamiliarity  of  provincial  governments  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  policy.  To  prevent  similar  delays,  the  people\u2019s  committees  in  HCMC  and  the \nproject provinces have been involved at an early stage to prepare the resettlement plan under \nthe  project.  Also,  immediately  after  the  feasibility  study  is  approved  by  MOT,  VEC  will  begin \nrecruiting consultants for project supervision and external environmental monitoring. Under the \nproject,  ADB  will  retroactively  finance  contracts  for  consulting  services  and  VEC  incremental \nadministration  costs  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness  (not  to  exceed  $3.0  million).  The \nborrower  and  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n17. \nVEC\u2019s incremental administration cost eligible for ADB financing comprises (i) salary, per \ndiem  for  field  visits,  meeting  and  workshops,  and  travel  cost  of  staff  in  the  BLLT-PMU;  (ii) \nproject  management  cost  for  VEC  headquarters  staff;  and  (ii)  vehicles,  maintenance,  office \nequipment,  communication,  water,  and  electricity  for  the  VEC  offices.  VEC  will  maintain \nseparate records for the incremental administration costs, and will submit to ADB (i) an annual \noperating  plan,  projected  financial  statements,  anticipated  debt  obligations,  and  estimated \nincremental  administration  costs\u2014to  be  estimated  based  on  an  acceptable  standard  costing \nmethod for charging incremental costs to the project\u20143 months before the referred fiscal year \nstarts; and (ii) an audited statement in the annual audit of accounts confirming that the charged \nservices were duly provided to the project. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2011\u2013December 2017   \n30 June 2017 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nMinistry of Transport \n(Chair) Deputy minister  \n(Members) Deputy directors general for Planning and Investment \nDepartment; International Relations Department; Environment \nDepartment; Finance and Accounting Department; Infrastructure \nDepartment; and Transport Construction Quality Control and \nManagement Bureau \nVietnam Expressway Corporation \nBen Luc-Long Thanh Project Management Unit \n20\u201325  staff,  (1  director,  2  deputy  directors,  10\u201315  engineers  for \nhighway,  structure  and  bridge,  3\u20134  resettlement  specialists,  1\u20132 \nenvironmental specialists, and 1\u20132 accountants) \nICB (works) \nICB (goods - laboratory \nequipment) \nNCB (works - \nlaboratory building) \nQCBS \n(technical:financial = \n80:20, FTP) \nCQS \n\n1 contract \n4,292 person-months \n\n$ 464.4 million \n$ 0.7 million \n\n6 contracts \n1 contract \n\n$ 18.2 million \n\n$ 0.4 million  \n\n$ 0.4 million \n\n1 contract \n\n2 contracts \n22 person-months \n\nAdvance action for procurement and consultant recruitment, and \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures are allowed. \nThe loans proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \nGovernment and ADB \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection, FTP = full technical proposal, HCMC = \nHo Chi Minh City, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe  project  area  is  identified  as  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  areas  to  global  climate \n18. \nchange. The expressway will run through soft soil and environmentally sensitive areas, and the \nproject  area  has  many  small  rivers  and  canals.  About  48%  of  the  expressway  will  consist  of \nbridges and viaducts. The expressway is designed to be a flood-proof structure. However, since \nthe project area will likely suffer from sea level rise and frequent floods, a detailed design study \nto be conducted by VEC under an ADB-financed TA project (footnote 6) will examine the need \nfor  design  changes  regarding  (i)  elevation  of  the  expressway  structures  where  underpasses, \nculverts,  and  canals  will  cross  under  the  expressway;  (ii)  elevation  of  expressway-associated \nfacilities  such  as  access  ramps  and  toll  booths;  and  (iii)  increased  capacity  of  cross-drainage \nstructures and facilities. \n  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  traffic  demands  were  analyzed  using  JICA\u2019s  computer-based  traffic  assignment \n19. \nmodel  and  traffic  data, 8\n and  forecast  for  target  years  of  2016,  2026,  and  2036.  The  model \ncovers  the  existing  major  roads  and  highways  in  the  HCMC  metropolitan  area;  the  project \nexpressway; and roads, highways, and expressways planned in the target years. The estimated \ndaily  traffic  volume  in  2026  is  35,000  to  60,000  passenger  car  units.  After  2027,  the  traffic \ndemands  will  reach  the  capacity  of  the  four-lane  expressway,  and  construction  of  additional \nlanes will be required. The economic benefits in terms of savings in vehicle operation cost and \ntravel  time  were  estimated  by  comparing  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  cases.  The \ntraffic  assignment  model  illustrates  that  the  expressway  clearly  attracts  traffic  from  more \ncongested,  slower,  and  less  developed  parts  of  the  road  network  in  HCMC.  Since  there  is  no \ndirect  road  connection  between  the  east  and  west  regions  of  HCMC,  the  project  will  yield \nsubstantial  savings  in  travel  times  and  costs  for  trips  moving  in  the  east\u2013west  direction. \nEconomic  analysis  shows  that  economic  internal  rate  of  return  would  reach  25.5%  at  the  toll \nrate  of  D1,000/km  (equivalent  to  $0.05/km)  for  passenger  cars,  which  is  considered  the \nmaximum level for the majority of drivers to use the expressway. \n \n20. \nFinancial  analyses  show  that  D1,000/km  for  passenger  cars  would  result  in  a  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  2.7%.  Since  the  project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  would  be \n0.7%,  the  project  is  financially  viable.  Under  the  loan  agreements  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment for the past two expressway projects, VEC needs to comply with (i) a debt service \ncoverage  ratio  higher  than  1.2,  and  (ii)  debt-to-equity  ratio  better  than  90:10  from  2020.  The \nlatest projection of VEC's consolidated financial statements reveals that VEC will have difficulty \nin  satisfying  these  financial  covenants,  and  will  face  serious  cash  shortfalls  after  2018. \nTherefore,  the  government  has  agreed  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  enable  VEC  to  meet \nthese indicators. \n  \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to the Government of \nViet  Nam  and  VEC.  In  the  road  sector,  strengthening  governance  is  a  core  component  of  the \nPATA  and,  as  noted  in  para.  7,  specific  measures  to  improve  governance  will  be  identified \nunder the first tranche and will be implemented under the second tranche.   \n \nVEC will publicly disclose on VEC\u2019s website information on how loan proceeds are being \n22. \nused,  presenting  (i)  procurement  contract  awards,  including  for  each  contract  (a)  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  (b)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (c)  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures \nadopted,  (d)  amount  of  contract  awarded,  (e)  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  (f) \nintended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each  contract;  and  (ii)  internal  and \nexternal resettlement reports. The website will be updated within 2 weeks after (i) each contract \naward,  (ii)  each  submission  of  environmental  and  resettlement  reports  to  be  prepared  by \nexternal  monitoring  agencies  (EMAs),  and  (iii)  each  submission  of  VEC\u2019s  internal  quarterly \nenvironment and resettlement reports. \n\n \n\n                                                \n8 JICA undertook an urban transport master plan and feasibility study in Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area, which is \ncommonly  known  as  HOUTRANS.  Traffic  data  in  HOUTRANS  and  STRADA  computer  software  were  used  for \ntransport demand analysis and assignment. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nThe percentage of the population living below the poverty line in HCMC is estimated to \nbe  currently  0.5%,  in  Dong  Nai  4.8%  and  in  Long  An  8.3%.  Compared  to  the  national  urban \npoverty  rate  of  6.7%  and  the  national  rural  poverty  rate  of  16.2%,  poverty  rates  in  the  project \nareas  are  very  low.  The  project  may  not  directly  serve  to  reduce  poverty  among  those  in  the \nproject areas living in poverty, because expressways are intended to serve long-distance traffic, \nand do not necessarily benefit local communities directly. However, the project will improve the \ninvestment climate for labor-intensive and export-orientated economic growth, which will be the \nmost  important  indirect  impact  on  the  people  living  in  poverty.  HCMC  is  home  to  the  most \ndiversified economic enterprises in Viet Nam. Over the past 25 years HCMC has been able to \nabsorb  large  numbers  of  relatively  unskilled  laborers,  including  most  importantly  young  rural \nwomen, who constitute 55% of the rural-to-urban migrant workforce in HCMC, especially in the \ntextile, garment, and footwear industries. Rapid movement of commodities to export markets is \na comparative advantage.  \n \nThe gender mainstreaming is categorized as some gender benefits. VEC will incorporate \n24. \nprovisions in all project contracts to the effect that contractors shall (i) comply with Viet Nam\u2019s \napplicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations and not employ child labor; (ii) \nprovide  safe  working  conditions,  water  and  separate  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female \nworkers;  (iii)  provide  equal  wages  to  male  and  female  workers  for  work  of  equal  value;  (iv) \nprovide  day  care  services  for  female  construction  workers;  and  (v)  carry  out  HIV,  illicit  drugs, \nand human trafficking prevention programs in construction campsites, with such programs held \nin coordination with government programs and other initiatives. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n25. \nThe  safeguard  categorizations  are  classified  as  A  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous people. An EIA and a resettlement plan for the project have \nbeen prepared to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS). SPS will \napply for the middle section of the expressway that is to be financed by a potential cofinancier \n(Japan). The government and VEC will carry out the EIA and resettlement plan for the section. \n \n26. \nThe  EIA  describes  the  environmental  baseline  conditions  in  the  project  area  and \nprovides  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  potential  physical,  biological,  and  socioeconomic \nimpacts  resulting  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project.  Major  impacts  identified \nduring the construction phase include emission of elevated levels of dust and noise due to site \nworks, operation of equipment and vehicles, and transport of construction materials and spoils. \nAcid  sulfate  soils  (ASSs)  constitute  almost  37%  of  the  project  area  (about  30%  are  potential \nASSs  and  7%  actual  ASSs),  and  disturbance  of  ASSs  could  have  a  detrimental  effect  on \naquatic resources due to acidification of rivers, streams and aquaculture ponds in the vicinity of \nthe project site. Pollution of water resources and the surrounding environment may also occur \ndue  to  earthworks  and  generation  of  construction  and  domestic  wastes. During  operation,  it  is \nanticipated  that  noise  levels  at  residential  areas  along  the  expressway  are  likely  to  exceed \nambient standards and that exhaust emissions will contribute to air pollution in the project area. \nThe mangrove forests in Can Gio district of HCMC have been declared as a biosphere reserve \nby  UNESCO.  The  expressway  alignment  will  run  through  6  km  of  the  transition  zone  of  the \nbiosphere reserve where no mangrove forests exist. The project is not anticipated to adversely \naffect the biosphere reserve.  \n \n\n \n\n\ffor \n\nimplementing  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  and \n\nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  included  in  the  EIA  specifies  a  range  of \n27. \nmitigation  and  pollution  control  measures  to  minimize  the  anticipated  negative  impacts  arising \nfrom  project  implementation.  The  EMP  specifies  a  detailed  environmental  monitoring  plan \ncovering  the  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  project.  The  EMP  also  clearly \ndefines the institutional arrangements and responsibilities for its implementation and includes an \nenvironmental  capacity-building  program  to  ensure  that  relevant  staff  of  VEC  and  its  project \nimplementation  unit  will  be  able  to  effectively  carry  out  their  roles  in  implementing  the  EMP.  \nEstimated  costs \nthe \nenvironmental training component are also included in the EMP. During the preparation of the \nEIA, a number of public consultations were conducted involving stakeholders such as affected \nhouseholds  and  local  officials  in  communes  and  districts  traversed  by  the  expressway \nalignment. The environmental concerns raised by the stakeholders are documented in the EIA \nand  suitable  mitigation  measures  have  been  included  in  the  EMP  to  adequately  address  their \nconcerns.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  based  on  existing  legal  provisions  has  been \ndeveloped to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding the environmental performance of the \nproject.  VEC  will  incorporate  the  required  environmental  measures  in  bidding  and  contract \ndocuments  for  the  civil  works,  and  civil  works  contractors  will  prepare  site-specific  EMPs \naccordingly. VEC will allocate sufficient staff resources for EMP implementation and monitoring, \nand will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. VEC will also engage an \nEMA  to  review  and  verify  on  an  annual  basis  the  accuracy,  breadth,  depth,  and  relevance  of \ninformation  provided  by  VEC  with  regard  to  EMP  implementation  and  to  determine  if  EMP \nprovisions are being conducted in a thorough and timely manner. \n \n28. \nAccording  to  the  highway  regulations  in  Viet  Nam,  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  will  have  a \nwidth  of  approximately  73\u201375  meters  for  the  embankment  sections,  and  52  meters  for  the \nbridge  and  viaduct  sections,  to  accommodate  the  8-lane  expressway  structures.  The  entire \nROW  width  of  the  expressway,  consisting  of  16.1  hectares  of  residential  lands  and  346.0 \nhectares  of  other  lands,  will  be  acquired  under  the  project.  An  estimated  2,558  households \n(approximately 11,194 persons) will be affected by the project. A resettlement plan for the entire \nproject has been prepared and project information brochures have been disseminated to people \naffected  by  the  project.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  following  completion  of  the \ndetailed  design  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence  before  any  land \nacquisition  and  relocation  activities  are  undertaken.  The  updated  resettlement  plans  will  be \nendorsed by the government and will be disclosed to the affected households and on the ADB \nwebsite.  VEC  will  monitor resettlement and  submit  the  quarterly  progress  reports to  ADB,  and \nalso  will  engage  an  EMA  to  monitor  and  evaluate  updating  and  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  to  fully  cover  the  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  Only  two  ethnic  minority  households\u2014which  are  well \nintegrated  into  the  wider  socioeconomic  and  cultural  community\u2014will  be  affected;  therefore, \npreparation of an ethnic minority action plan is not required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. One of the major risks \nis  a  delay  in  project  completion,  which may  be caused  by  delay  of  consultant  recruitment  and \nprocurement,  slow  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  or  poor  performance  of \nconsultants  and  contractors.  Delay  of  the  expressway  opening  will  significantly  affect  VEC\u2019s \nfinancial  condition.  Other  risks  include  cost  overruns  caused  by  detailed  designs  and  general \nprice  escalation,  and  an  increase  in  VEC\u2019s  debt  service  requirements.  To  reduce  these  risks, \nVEC\u2019s  capacity  for  project  and  financial  management  is  being  strengthened.  The  risk  of \nnegative  environmental  impacts  being  caused  by  the  project  can  be  avoided  by  ensuring \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fcompliance with the EIA and the EMP.
