I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility  (MFF)  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet Nam for  the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project. \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \n2.  The project will construct a 57.1 kilometer (km) expressway between Ben Luc and Long \nThanh in the south of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), which is a short link of the GMS Southern \nEconomic  Corridor  (SEC).  The  executing  agency  is  the  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation \n(VEC), which was established under the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to develop the national \nexpressway network in Viet Nam. The project expressway consists of a southern link to the \nplanned  HCMC  Third Ring  Road  and  an  access  link  to the  planned  Bien  Hoa\u2013Vung  Tau \nexpressway (see map). The starting point of the project expressway is an interchange with the \nexisting HCMC-Trung Luong expressway, and the ending point is an interchange with the \nplanned Bien Hoa\u2013Vung Tau expressway. The project expressway will be constructed with four \nlanes and the government will expand the width to eight lanes when traffic demand reaches \ncapacity.  The  following  six  interchanges  (ICs)  are  planned  under  the  project:  (i)  IC1  with \nHCMC\u2013Trung Luong expressway; (ii) IC2 with National Highway 1A; (iii) IC3 with National \nHighway 50; (iv) IC4 with Nguyen Van Tao; (v) IC6 with Phuoc An; and (vi) IC7 with National \nHighway 51. IC5 with HCMC Third Ring Road and IC8 with Bien Hoa\u2013Vung Tau expressway \nwill be constructed after the completion of the Third Ring Road and the Bien Hoa\u2013Vung Tau \nexpressway. The project expressway is divided into a western section (19.8 km), a middle \nsection (11.0 km), and an eastern section (26.3 km). For the expressway construction, ADB will \nfinance the western and eastern sections, and a potential cofinancier (Japan) is expected to \nfinance the middle section. The project expressway will be tolled and operated by VEC. VEC \nestablished a subsidiary company to operate and maintain the expressways through a public\u2013\nprivate partnership concession arrangement. \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In the south of HCMC, east\u2013west traffic is restricted due to the lack of river crossing \nfacilities,  forcing  vehicles  into  the  center  of  HCMC.  A  substantial  shift  has  occurred  from \nmotorcycles  to  passenger  cars  in  the  project  area,  further  exacerbating  traffic  congestion. \nConstruction  of  HCMC  ring  roads  to  establish  connectivity  with  neighboring  cities  through \nexpressway links is a high priority of the government. In this regard, the project will facilitate \neast\u2013west  traffic  south  of  HCMC,  thereby  diverting  through-traffic  and  reducing  traffic \ncongestion  in  the  center  of  HCMC.  Through  construction  of  the  project  expressway,  the \nconnectivity of cities and towns around HCMC will also be improved, and transport costs and \ntravel times for the movement of passengers and goods in and around HCMC will be reduced. \nMoreover, the project expressway is identified as a part of the national north\u2013south expressway \nthat links into the Mekong Delta, which is the rice basket of Asia. It will be used as a freight \nroute to transport food produced in the Mekong Delta to the rest of the country and overseas via \nland and maritime transport. \n \n4.  Furthermore, the project will strengthen subregional connectivity and international trade \nwith  the  neighboring  country  of  Cambodia.  Under  the  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement \nbetween  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia,  Viet  Nam  agreed  to  accept  entry  of  150  Cambodian \ncommercial vehicles into Viet Nam, and vice-versa. For commercial vehicles in Cambodia, \nimproved access to ports in HCMC will reduce freight cost and travel time, especially for ", "2 \ncargoes  to  and  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  United  States.  The \ntransport of goods between Cambodia and HCMC through the GMS SEC is constrained by the \nabsence of a Mekong River bridge at Neak Laong in Cambodia, as well as the heavy traffic \ncongestion around HCMC. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is implementing \nthe Mekong River bridge project at Neak Laong, and the project expressway will provide an \nexpress route to and from the ports in HCMC. Therefore, the project expressway, coupled with \nthe JICA-financed bridge project, is expected to improve transport efficiency in the GMS SEC \nand expand international trade between the two countries.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam1 aims to help the \nGovernment of Viet Nam reduce poverty, in accordance with the government\u2019s socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan,2 through (i) pro-poor business-led economic growth, (ii) social equity and \nbalanced development, and (iii) environmental protection and management. The CSP promotes \ngood governance and places a high priority on contributing to regional cooperation. In light of \nthe expected strong expansion of the Vietnamese economy, the CSP recognizes the need for \naccelerated  improvements  in  infrastructure,  particularly  transportation  and  energy,  and  in \nhuman resource development. \n \n6.  In January 2010, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam approved a master plan for 16 north\u2013\nsouth expressways along the eastern side of Viet Nam, including the Ben Luc-Long Thanh \nExpressway.  The  master  plan  includes  alignment,  technical  standards,  investment  cost, \nconstruction period, project owners, and project financiers for each expressway project.3 The \nmaster plan will be implemented over 14 years (from 2010 to 2023); the cost is estimated at \nabout $17.9 billion, or about $10 million per km, with an average yearly investment of about $1.3 \nbillion. \n \n7.  The MFF is an appropriate modality to finance the project expressway, as a large stand-\nalone project to be implemented under the master plan, for the following reasons: (i) the project \nexpressway is included within the government\u2019s master plan for expressways, which, in addition \nto ADB\u2019s assessment, strategy, and road map study for the transport sector, provides the \nstrategic context, policy framework, and investment program for expressway development in \nViet Nam; (ii) the size and cost of the project expressway requires a phased approach to \nconstruction\u2014the western section of the expressway needs to be constructed immediately \nunder the first tranche, given the rapid urbanization and severe traffic congestion in the west of \nHCMC; (iii) the MFF modality provides for financing flexibility, which is advantageous because a \ncommitment to project financing by a potential cofinancier (Japan) cannot be made in 2010\u2014\ncofinancing arrangements will be made in 2011 and linked to the second tranche; and (iv) the \nMFF incorporates a long-term structural reform program for the road transport sector, defined \nthrough policy advisory technical assistance (PATA),4 which aims to strengthen institutional \narrangements, operation and maintenance, and governance, and will develop guidelines for (a) \nefficient  management  of  the  Directorate  for  Roads  in  Viet  Nam  and  Vietnam  Expressway \nManagement Administration, (b) financial arrangements of expressway projects and financial \nempowerment  of  VEC,  (c)  flexible  design  standards,  and  (d)  an  improved  framework  for \ngovernance  of  the  road  sector,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  in  ADB\u2019s  sector \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2006.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be increased competitiveness of the regional economy \nalong the GMS SEC in southern Viet Nam and the neighboring GMS countries. By expanding \naccess  to  markets,  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  and  contributing  to \nconnectivity improvements in the GMS, the project will promote sustainable economic growth \nand regional cooperation. The outcome of the project will be more efficient and safer movement \nof goods and people in the greater HCMC area.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project will increase the density of the HCMC road network, enhance connectivity \nbetween the eastern and western regions of HCMC, and\u2014coupled with PATA implementation\u2014\nimprove the project management and financial management capacity of VEC. The western \nsection of the expressway to be constructed under the first tranche is expected to be completed \nin the middle of 2015, and operation is scheduled for 2016. The entire expressway, including the \neastern and middle sections to be constructed under the second tranche, is expected to be \ncompleted in the middle of 2016, with operation scheduled for 2017. \n  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $1.608 billion, inclusive of local taxes, contingencies, \nand financing charges during development. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are \nincluded in the facility administration manual (FAM). The project financing plan is provided in \nTable 2. ADB and a potential cofinancier (Japan) will each finance about 40% of the project \ncost, and the counterpart funds will finance about 20% of the project cost. Parallel cofinancing \nbetween ADB and the cofinancier is expected for the second tranche of the MFF. Also, ADB \nprovided TA6 of $1.5 million (funded by the Japan Special Fund) for preparing the project, and a \nTA loan7 of $27.0 million for preparing detailed designs of three expressways, including the \nproject expressway. \n \n11.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $636.0 million from ADB's \nordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the project. The MFF will consist of two \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government's  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first \ntranche of the MFF will have a 27-year term, including a grace period of 7 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, the interest and other charges \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2009.

The potential cofinancier (Japan) is expected to cofinance $635.0 million including (i) \ncivil works for the middle section of the expressway; (ii) facilities for the entire length of the \nexpressway such as operation and maintenance system, toll collection system, information and \ncommunication  system,  weigh  station,  and  intelligent  transport  system;  and  (iii)  project \nsupervision consulting services for the middle section. The expressway crosses Soai Rap and \nLong Tau rivers in the middle section. The Binh Khanh bridge (across the Soai Rap river) and \nthe Phuoc Khanh bridge (across Long Tau river) will be cable-stay bridges with a 55-meter \nnavigation clearance, and with central spans of 435 meters and 375 meters, respectively.  \n ", "5 \n13.  The government\u2019s counterpart funds will be used for (i) land acquisition and resettlement \nfor the entire expressway; (ii) unexploded ordnance clearance works for the entire expressway; \nand (iii) the local taxes to be imposed on the above cofinancing components, because the land \nacquisition and resettlement and the unexploded ordnance clearance works need to start before \nloan effectiveness, and the local taxes are ineligible for payment by a potential cofinancier \n(Japan). The estimated amount of the counterpart funds is $337.0 million. The government \nassures that counterpart funds will be increased in case of any shortfall in financing. As the \ncounterpart funding is about 20% of the total project cost, ADB\u2019s financing should cover all of \nthe local taxes imposed on ADB-financed civil works, consulting services, and VEC laboratory in \nthe amount of $44.3 million. This is only 2.8% of the total project cost. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nFAM. VEC, as the project executing agency, will implement the project under the oversight of \nMOT. VEC will establish a Ben Luc-Long Thanh project management unit (BLLT-PMU) that will \nbe the focal point for project coordination and communication with ADB and other relevant \nagencies of the borrower. The BLLT-PMU will also (i) carry out the procurement activities, (ii) \nimplement the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the resettlement plan approved by \nADB,  (iii)  supervise  the  consultants  and  contractors  under  the  project,  (iv)  prepare  the \nnecessary documentations for the withdrawal of loan proceeds, and (v) prepare periodic reports \nto ADB.  \n \n15.  All works and consulting services to be financed out of the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe subject to and governed by ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime), and ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe government and a potential cofinancier (Japan) will make their own arrangements for \nprocurement and consultant recruitment. \n \n16.  Experience from  ongoing  expressway  projects in  Viet  Nam  indicates that  delays  in \npreconstruction activities contribute to project implementation delays. For example, resettlement \nplan  updating  was  delayed  due  to  the  unfamiliarity  of  provincial  governments  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  policy.  To prevent  similar  delays, the  people\u2019s committees  in  HCMC  and  the \nproject provinces have been involved at an early stage to prepare the resettlement plan under \nthe project. Also, immediately after the feasibility study is approved by MOT, VEC will begin \nrecruiting consultants for project supervision and external environmental monitoring. Under the \nproject, ADB will retroactively finance contracts for consulting services and VEC incremental \nadministration  costs  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness  (not  to  exceed  $3.0  million).  The \nborrower  and  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n17.  VEC\u2019s incremental administration cost eligible for ADB financing comprises (i) salary, per \ndiem for field visits, meeting and workshops, and travel cost of staff in the BLLT-PMU; (ii) \nproject management cost for VEC headquarters staff; and (ii) vehicles, maintenance, office \nequipment,  communication,  water,  and  electricity  for  the  VEC  offices.  VEC  will  maintain \nseparate records for the incremental administration costs, and will submit to ADB (i) an annual \noperating  plan,  projected  financial  statements,  anticipated  debt  obligations,  and  estimated \nincremental administration costs\u2014to be estimated based on an acceptable standard costing \nmethod for charging incremental costs to the project\u20143 months before the referred fiscal year \nstarts; and (ii) an audited statement in the annual audit of accounts confirming that the charged \nservices were duly provided to the project. \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2011\u2013December 2017   \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2017 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Transport \n(Chair) Deputy minister  \n(Members) Deputy directors general for Planning and Investment \nDepartment; International Relations Department; Environment \nDepartment; Finance and Accounting Department; Infrastructure \nDepartment; and Transport Construction Quality Control and \nManagement Bureau \n(ii)  Executing agency  Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Ben Luc-Long Thanh Project Management Unit \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  20\u201325 staff, (1 director, 2 deputy directors, 10\u201315 engineers for \nhighway, structure and  bridge, 3\u20134 resettlement  specialists, 1\u20132 \nenvironmental specialists, and 1\u20132 accountants) \nProcurement  ICB (works)  6 contracts  $ 464.4 million \nICB (goods - laboratory  1 contract  $ 0.7 million \nequipment) \nNCB (works -  1 contract  $ 0.4 million  \nlaboratory building) \nConsulting services  QCBS  1 contract  $ 18.2 million \n(technical:financial =  4,292 person-months \n80:20, FTP) \nCQS  2 contracts  $ 0.4 million \n22 person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance action for procurement and consultant recruitment, and \nadvance contracting  retroactive financing for eligible expenditures are allowed. \nDisbursement   The loans proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \nGovernment and ADB \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection, FTP = full technical proposal, HCMC = \nHo Chi Minh City, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  The project area is identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to global climate \nchange. The expressway will run through soft soil and environmentally sensitive areas, and the \nproject area has many small rivers and canals. About 48% of the expressway will consist of \nbridges and viaducts. The expressway is designed to be a flood-proof structure. However, since \nthe project area will likely suffer from sea level rise and frequent floods, a detailed design study \nto be conducted by VEC under an ADB-financed TA project (footnote 6) will examine the need \nfor design changes regarding (i) elevation of the expressway structures where underpasses, \nculverts, and canals will cross under the expressway; (ii) elevation of expressway-associated \nfacilities such as access ramps and toll booths; and (iii) increased capacity of cross-drainage \nstructures and facilities. \n  \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The traffic demands were analyzed using JICA\u2019s computer-based traffic assignment \nmodel and traffic data,8 and forecast for target years of 2016, 2026, and 2036. The model \ncovers the existing major roads and highways in the HCMC metropolitan area; the project \nexpressway; and roads, highways, and expressways planned in the target years. The estimated \ndaily traffic volume in 2026 is 35,000 to 60,000 passenger car units. After 2027, the traffic \ndemands will reach the capacity of the four-lane expressway, and construction of additional \nlanes will be required. The economic benefits in terms of savings in vehicle operation cost and \ntravel time were estimated by comparing the \u201cwith project\u201d\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d cases. The \ntraffic  assignment  model  illustrates  that  the  expressway  clearly  attracts  traffic  from  more \ncongested, slower, and less developed parts of the road network in HCMC. Since there is no \ndirect road connection between the east and west regions of HCMC, the project will yield \nsubstantial  savings  in  travel  times  and  costs  for  trips  moving  in  the  east\u2013west  direction. \nEconomic analysis shows that economic internal rate of return would reach 25.5% at the toll \nrate  of  D1,000/km  (equivalent  to  $0.05/km)  for  passenger  cars,  which  is  considered  the \nmaximum level for the majority of drivers to use the expressway. \n \n20.  Financial analyses show that D1,000/km for passenger cars would result in a financial \ninternal rate of return of 2.7%. Since the project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital would be \n0.7%,  the  project  is  financially  viable.  Under  the  loan  agreements  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment for the past two expressway projects, VEC needs to comply with (i) a debt service \ncoverage ratio higher than 1.2, and (ii) debt-to-equity ratio better than 90:10 from 2020. The \nlatest projection of VEC's consolidated financial statements reveals that VEC will have difficulty \nin  satisfying  these  financial  covenants,  and  will  face  serious  cash  shortfalls  after  2018. \nTherefore, the government has agreed to provide financial assistance to enable VEC to meet \nthese indicators. \n  \nC.  Governance \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Combating Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to the Government of \nViet Nam and VEC. In the road sector, strengthening governance is a core component of the \nPATA and, as noted in para. 7, specific measures to improve governance will be identified \nunder the first tranche and will be implemented under the second tranche.   \n \n22.  VEC will publicly disclose on VEC\u2019s website information on how loan proceeds are being \nused,  presenting  (i)  procurement  contract  awards,  including  for  each  contract  (a)  list  of \nparticipating bidders, (b) name of the winning bidder, (c) basic details on bidding procedures \nadopted, (d)  amount  of  contract  awarded,  (e) list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  (f) \nintended and actual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract; and (ii) internal and \nexternal resettlement reports. The website will be updated within 2 weeks after (i) each contract \naward,  (ii)  each  submission  of  environmental  and  resettlement  reports  to  be  prepared  by \nexternal monitoring agencies (EMAs), and (iii) each submission of VEC\u2019s internal quarterly \nenvironment and resettlement reports. \n \n                                                \n8 JICA undertook an urban transport master plan and feasibility study in Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area, which is \ncommonly known as HOUTRANS. Traffic data in HOUTRANS and STRADA computer software were used for \ntransport demand analysis and assignment. \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The percentage of the population living below the poverty line in HCMC is estimated to \nbe currently 0.5%, in Dong Nai 4.8% and in Long An 8.3%. Compared to the national urban \npoverty rate of 6.7% and the national rural poverty rate of 16.2%, poverty rates in the project \nareas are very low. The project may not directly serve to reduce poverty among those in the \nproject areas living in poverty, because expressways are intended to serve long-distance traffic, \nand do not necessarily benefit local communities directly. However, the project will improve the \ninvestment climate for labor-intensive and export-orientated economic growth, which will be the \nmost important indirect impact on the people living in poverty. HCMC is home to the most \ndiversified economic enterprises in Viet Nam. Over the past 25 years HCMC has been able to \nabsorb large numbers of relatively unskilled laborers, including most importantly young rural \nwomen, who constitute 55% of the rural-to-urban migrant workforce in HCMC, especially in the \ntextile, garment, and footwear industries. Rapid movement of commodities to export markets is \na comparative advantage.  \n \n24.  The gender mainstreaming is categorized as some gender benefits. VEC will incorporate \nprovisions in all project contracts to the effect that contractors shall (i) comply with Viet Nam\u2019s \napplicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations and not employ child labor; (ii) \nprovide safe working conditions, water and separate sanitation facilities for male and female \nworkers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and female workers for work of equal value; (iv) \nprovide day care services for female construction workers; and (v) carry out HIV, illicit drugs, \nand human trafficking prevention programs in construction campsites, with such programs held \nin coordination with government programs and other initiatives. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The  safeguard  categorizations  are  classified  as  A  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous people. An EIA and a resettlement plan for the project have \nbeen prepared to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS). SPS will \napply for the middle section of the expressway that is to be financed by a potential cofinancier \n(Japan). The government and VEC will carry out the EIA and resettlement plan for the section. \n \n26.  The  EIA  describes  the  environmental  baseline  conditions  in  the  project  area  and \nprovides a comprehensive assessment of potential physical, biological, and socioeconomic \nimpacts resulting from the construction and operation of the project. Major impacts identified \nduring the construction phase include emission of elevated levels of dust and noise due to site \nworks, operation of equipment and vehicles, and transport of construction materials and spoils. \nAcid sulfate soils (ASSs) constitute almost 37% of the project area (about 30% are potential \nASSs and 7% actual ASSs), and disturbance of ASSs could have a detrimental effect on \naquatic resources due to acidification of rivers, streams and aquaculture ponds in the vicinity of \nthe project site. Pollution of water resources and the surrounding environment may also occur \ndue to earthworks and generation of construction and domestic wastes. During operation, it is \nanticipated that noise levels at residential areas along the expressway are likely to exceed \nambient standards and that exhaust emissions will contribute to air pollution in the project area. \nThe mangrove forests in Can Gio district of HCMC have been declared as a biosphere reserve \nby UNESCO. The expressway alignment will run through 6 km of the transition zone of the \nbiosphere reserve where no mangrove forests exist. The project is not anticipated to adversely \naffect the biosphere reserve.  \n \n ", "9 \n27.  The environmental management plan (EMP) included in the EIA specifies a range of \nmitigation and pollution control measures to minimize the anticipated negative impacts arising \nfrom  project  implementation.  The  EMP  specifies  a  detailed  environmental  monitoring  plan \ncovering the preconstruction, construction, and operation of the project. The EMP also clearly \ndefines the institutional arrangements and responsibilities for its implementation and includes an \nenvironmental capacity-building program to ensure that relevant staff of VEC and its project \nimplementation unit will be able to effectively carry out their roles in implementing the EMP.  \nEstimated  costs  for  implementing  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  and  the \nenvironmental training component are also included in the EMP. During the preparation of the \nEIA, a number of public consultations were conducted involving stakeholders such as affected \nhouseholds  and  local  officials  in  communes  and  districts  traversed  by  the  expressway \nalignment. The environmental concerns raised by the stakeholders are documented in the EIA \nand suitable mitigation measures have been included in the EMP to adequately address their \nconcerns.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  based  on  existing  legal  provisions  has  been \ndeveloped to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding the environmental performance of the \nproject. VEC will incorporate the required environmental measures in bidding and contract \ndocuments  for  the  civil  works,  and  civil  works  contractors  will  prepare  site-specific  EMPs \naccordingly. VEC will allocate sufficient staff resources for EMP implementation and monitoring, \nand will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. VEC will also engage an \nEMA to review and verify on an annual basis the accuracy, breadth, depth, and relevance of \ninformation provided by VEC with regard to EMP implementation and to determine if EMP \nprovisions are being conducted in a thorough and timely manner. \n \n28.  According to the highway regulations in Viet Nam, the right-of-way (ROW) will have a \nwidth of approximately 73\u201375 meters for the embankment sections, and 52 meters for the \nbridge and viaduct sections, to accommodate the 8-lane expressway structures. The entire \nROW width of the expressway, consisting of 16.1 hectares of residential lands and 346.0 \nhectares of other lands, will be acquired under the project. An estimated 2,558 households \n(approximately 11,194 persons) will be affected by the project. A resettlement plan for the entire \nproject has been prepared and project information brochures have been disseminated to people \naffected by the project. The resettlement plan will be updated following completion of the \ndetailed design and will be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence before any land \nacquisition and relocation activities are undertaken. The updated resettlement plans will be \nendorsed by the government and will be disclosed to the affected households and on the ADB \nwebsite. VEC will monitor resettlement and submit the quarterly progress reports to ADB, and \nalso  will  engage  an  EMA  to  monitor  and  evaluate  updating  and  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  to  fully  cover  the  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  Only  two  ethnic  minority  households\u2014which  are  well \nintegrated into the wider socioeconomic and cultural community\u2014will be affected; therefore, \npreparation of an ethnic minority action plan is not required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. One of the major risks \nis a delay in project completion, which may be caused by delay of consultant recruitment and \nprocurement,  slow  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  or  poor  performance  of \nconsultants and contractors. Delay of the expressway opening will significantly affect VEC\u2019s \nfinancial condition. Other risks include cost overruns caused by detailed designs and general \nprice escalation, and an increase in VEC\u2019s debt service requirements. To reduce these risks, \nVEC\u2019s  capacity  for  project  and  financial  management  is  being  strengthened.  The  risk  of \nnegative  environmental  impacts  being  caused  by  the  project  can  be  avoided  by  ensuring \n ", "10 \ncompliance with the EIA and the EMP. Overall, the project risks can be reduced and controlled \nby advance and proactive actions and strategic management of project implementation, training \nof VEC staff, and close monitoring of social and environmental safeguards.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in commencement of project  Advanced training on procurement and consultant \nimplementation  recruitment for VEC staff by ADB \nDelays in land acquisition and  Frequent meetings with VEC, and People\u2019s Committees of \nresettlement  HCMC, and Dong Nai and Loan An provinces  \nCost overrun caused by detailed  Flexible financing and procurement arrangements through \ndesigns and general price escalation  the MFF arrangement \nVulnerable financial condition of VEC   Careful review of VEC's annual audit report; capacity \ndevelopment of VEC's project and financial management, \nand VEC debt monitoring, prevention of overborrowing \nthrough coordination with major development partners, and \ngovernment assistance with debt service in the event of \nfinancial difficulty by VEC.   \nEnvironmental impacts by the civil works  Implementation of environmental management, close \non environmentally sensitive areas    monitoring of compliance with the approved EIA and EMP  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIA = environmental impact assessment, EMP = environmental management \nplan, HCMC = Ho Chi Minh City, MFF = multitranche financing facility, VEC = Vietnam Expressway Corporation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n30.  The government and VEC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and VEC have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government \nand VEC with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement \nand project agreement for the respective tranches. In addition to the standard conditions for \nloan effectiveness, the following condition for loan effectiveness is incorporated in the legal \ndocuments: the subsidiary loan agreement between the government and VEC will have been \nexecuted and be binding on the parties. \n \nV.
