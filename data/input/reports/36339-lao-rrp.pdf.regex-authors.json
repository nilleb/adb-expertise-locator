The  Project  will  not  have  significant \nAssessment  adverse environmental effects. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) for the project, a summary IEE, an IEE for each of the sample \nsubprojects,  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n   \nProject Description   The Project has been designed to improve the quality of life of the \nresidents of small towns in Lao PDR and to enhance the towns\u2019 roles \nas economic, market, manufacturing, and service centers for their \nsurrounding rural areas. It will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts \nto increase the percentage of the urban population with access to \nsafe piped water to 80% by 2020. The Project aims to strengthen the \noverall water supply sector by supporting the establishment of the \nWater  Supply  Regulatory  Committee  (WSRC);  assisting  its \nsecretariat,  the  Water  Supply  Authority  (WASA),  to  carry  out  its \nsector  regulatory  functions;  and  helping  the  water  supply  utilities \n(PNPs) to become corporate entities under the Enterprise Law. The \nProject will provide support for business and financial management, \nand  efficient  operation  and  maintenance  to  improve  PNPs\u2019 \norganizational performance and sustainability.  \nThe Project will support the provision of piped water and sanitation \nservices for an estimated 137,000 residents in 124 villages in 15 small \ntowns. It is a sector investment project with the following outputs: (i) a \nstronger and more sustainable urban water supply sector; (ii) new and \nrehabilitated water supply systems in 15 small towns; (iii) improved \ndrainage and public sanitation; (iv) enhanced community action and \nparticipation; (v) more gender equity in urban water and sanitation; \nand (vi) improved capacity for project implementation and operation \nand maintenance.  \n   \nRationale  Lao PDR remains essentially a rural country. It had a population of \n5.6 million in 2005, but its high population growth rate of 2.1% per \nannum means this is expected to rise to 7.3 million by 2020. About \n27% of the population lives in urban centers or towns. Urban district \ncenters and villages with populations from 2,000 to 20,000 people are \nclassified  as  small  towns.  Inadequate  water  supply  and  poor \nenvironmental conditions in these small towns results in poor health, \nlost work and school days, and more household expenditure on health \ncare.  It  also  deters  socioeconomic  development  and  restricts  the \n ", "ii   \n \nability of these towns to serve as key administrative and economic \ncenters. In 2006, the overall piped water coverage in the towns was \n21%, while sanitation coverage in the form of pour-flush toilets was \n69%. Many urban households lack water during the dry season to \nclean toilet facilities, which makes it difficult to maintain hygiene in the \nhome. The  importance  of  water supply and sanitation services in \nsmall towns is increasing, as the Lao PDR becomes more regionally \nconnected by better road networks, increased tourism, and greater \ninterregional  trade.  Small  towns  located  in  key  transport  and \neconomic corridors are instrumental in supporting the economic and \nhuman development opportunities in the surrounding rural areas. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts \nto expand access to safe piped water for 80% of the urban population \nby 2020. It will contribute to the achievement of a country-wide target \nof increasing safe piped water supply coverage to 65% of the overall \nurban population and providing pour-flush latrines to 80% of urban \nhouseholds by 2014. The outcome of the Project will be to improve \nthe access, quality, and reliability of the water supply and sanitation \nservices for an estimated 137,000 residents in 124 core villages in 15 \nsmall towns throughout Lao PDR.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is $31.4 million, including taxes \nand duties of $2.1 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A  grant  of  $23,000,000  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment Fund. The Government of Australia will provide a grant \nof  $5,300,000  equivalent,  and  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund (GDCF) will provide a grant of $500,000 equivalent, \nboth to be administered by ADB. \n   \nTotal \n  Source  ($ million)    Share (%) \n  ADB   23.00    73.1 \n  Government of Australiaa  5.30    16.9 \n  Gender  and  Development       \nCooperation Fund b  0.50  1.6 \n  Government of Lao PDR     2.48    7.9 \n  Beneficiaries     0.16    0.5 \n  Total  31.44     100.0 \n  a The Government of Australia has indicated that it will provide A$8.0 million in joint \ncofinancing. \nb Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend part of the proceeds from ADB\u2019s Special \nTerms  Funds and the Government of Australia, equal to 30% of the capital \ninvestment costs of its respective water supply system to each PNP \nthrough  a  subproject  loan  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nsubproject loans will have a maturity of 25 years with a grace period of \n6 years, and a fixed interest rate of 6.4%. The balance of 70% of the \ncost will be provided from the same sources to the PNPs as a grant. \n   \n ", "  iii\nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  Until 30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) \n   \nImplementation  The MPWT will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A national \nArrangements  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  vice-minister  of \nMPWT will provide overall project direction and guidance. A PSC \nsubcommittee will oversee the process of PNP corporatization. The \nproject coordination unit (PCU) for the ongoing ADB Northern and \nCentral  Regions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project \n(NCRWSSP)  in  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning \n(DHUP) of MPWT will be expanded and will be responsible for overall \nplanning, coordination, and management of the Project. A provincial \nproject steering committee (PPSC) will provide project direction and \nguidance for the subproject in each project province and coordinate \nprovincial and district agencies. A project implementation unit (PIU), \nwithin  each  provincial  department  of  public  works  and  transport \n(DPWT) will be responsible for daily subproject implementation. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures \nwill be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over \n$1.0 million,  and  for  supply  contracts  valued  over  $500,000. \nProcurement of civil works valued at less than $1.0 million equivalent \nwill  be  undertaken  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB). \nShopping procedures will be followed for materials and equipment \npackages or works estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent. \nADB shopping procedures will be used for small village-level civil \nworks  and  supply  contracts,  and  for  awareness  activities  and \nequipment under the community action and participation program.   \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants financed from the proceeds of the grant will be recruited \nin line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  A  total  of  859  person-months  of \nconsulting services (124 person-months international and 735 person-\nmonths national) will be required to assist in project management, \ndesign and construction supervision of water supply and sanitation \ninfrastructure, institutional and human resource development, social \ndevelopment, involuntary resettlement, environment safeguards, and \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation. Consulting services \nwill be hired through one firm, using quality- and cost-based selection \n(QCBS)  and  following  the  standard  quality\u2013ratio  of  80:20.  GDCF-\nsupported consultants will be recruited as individuals.  \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to benefit an estimated 137,000 residents in \nBeneficiaries  124 villages in 15 small towns, by providing safe, reliable piped water, \nincreasing  health  and  hygiene  awareness,  and  improving  urban \nenvironments. About 13% of all beneficiaries are expected to be poor. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  health  and  living \nconditions  of  the  communities  living  in  the  towns.  Residents  will \nbenefit  from  improved  health,  savings  in  health  care  costs,  and \nultimately income benefits from expanded access to piped water and \nsanitation services. Water and sanitation-related diseases contribute \nsignificantly to the poor health status of many women and children, \nincluding high infant mortality rates. Provision of sanitation facilities in \npublic areas and schools will improve the environmental conditions \nand public health of residents and students. Water and sanitation is \nparticularly important for women, who are primarily responsible for \nwater  collection  and  storage  to  meet  daily  household  needs  and \nfamily health. Women spend up to 2 hours per day collecting and \nstoring  water.  Expanded  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage  in \nsmall towns with high tourism potential will improve the attractiveness \nof destinations for tourists. In the tourism industry, women are often \nresponsible for preparing food and operating home stays. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Institutional  and  Governance  Risks.  Potential  risks  include \n(i) delayed sector regulation as a ministerial decision is required to \nestablish the WSRC, appoint its members, and outline the regulatory \nfunctions  and  relationships  between  the  WSRC  and  WASA, \n(ii) resistance from provincial governors to corporatization of PNPs \nand  their  autonomous  status;  (iii)  failure  to  conduct  annual  tariff \nreviews and subsequent tariff adjustments; and (iv) lack of public \nsupport  for  annual  tariff  adjustments.  To  mitigate  these  risks:  (i) \nactions are included in the Project to inform key stakeholders about \nsector regulation and corporatization and to generate support for the \nProject; (ii) the existing memorandum of agreement between the PNP \nboard and Office of the Provincial Governor (OPG) will be expanded \nto include a number of regulatory provisions; (iii) a phased approach \nwill be  adopted for PNP corporatization, beginning with four PNPs; \n(iv)  policy  reform  actions  for  PNP  corporatization  are  linked  to \ndisbursement  milestones  such  as  tariff  reviews  and  adjustments \nbefore  subproject  approval;  (v)  the  subproject  loan  agreement \nbetween  the  PNP  board  and  the  Government  with  the  OPG  as \nwitness, includes the tariff structure, a 3-year projected tariff level and \na  possible  tariff  adjustment  mechanism;  (vi) a  human  resources \nstrategy  and  scholarships  program  will  be  developed;  and  (vii) \nawareness campaigns will be conducted with communities. \n \nTechnical Risks. The lack of reliable raw water assessments could \nresult in the identification of inappropriate water sources. To mitigate \nthis risk, mechanisms have been incorporated in the project design \nto select good water sources and appropriate technology, collect raw \nwater  measurements,  and  manage,  operate  and  maintain  water \nsupply systems. To qualify for inclusion in the Project, subprojects \nneed to have conducted raw water quantity and quality tests in at \nleast three dry and wet seasons prior to constructions.   \n ", "  v\n   \nProject Implementation Risks. These include possible front-end and \nother delays in implementation caused by a delay in project approval; \ndelay  in  securing  joint  cofinancing;  slow  development  of  project \nplanning, management and administration capabilities; and unclear \nfund flow procedures of parallel financiers. To mitigate these risks (i) a \nfinancial management assessment of the EA was completed; (ii) the \ndesign of the Project closely follows that of the NCRWSSP and uses \nthe  same  PCU;  (iii)  PIUs  will  have  to  submit  training  needs \nassessments at the time of establishment; and (iv) periodic reviews of \nprogress against these training needs assessments will be conducted.\n ", "vi   \n \n ", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant, (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of grants to be provided \nrespectively by the Government of Australia and by the Gender and Development Cooperation \nFund,1 all to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Small Towns Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project (STWSP). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Following a request from the Government of the Lao PDR, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved technical assistance (TA)2 to prepare the STWSP. The Project is included in \nthe Lao PDR country operations business plan (2008\u20132011) as a grant project for 2008.  \n \n3.  Lao PDR remains essentially a rural country. It had a population of 5.6 million in 2005, but \nits high population growth rate of 2.1% means this is expected to rise to 7.3 million by 2020. About \n73% of the population lives in nearly 12,000 small rural villages, with the remaining 27% in urban \ncenters or towns. About 42% of the urban population lives in 140 small towns ranging from 2,000 \nto 20,000 people. Residents of these small towns spend considerable time, energy, and financial \nresources acquiring their daily water from water sources, small independent providers, or from \nbottled water suppliers. Many women spend about 2 hours daily collecting and storing water, \nadding significantly to their workload.  \n \n4.  Small towns within transport and economic corridors can play a key role in supporting the \neconomic and human development opportunities in surrounding rural areas. However, inadequate \nwater supply and poor sanitation in small towns in Lao PDR contribute to poor health, deter \nsocioeconomic development, and restrict the ability of the towns to serve as administrative and \neconomic centers. Many people in these small towns still rely for their water on shallow wells, \nponds, and streams, many of which are biologically contaminated. In 2006, piped water coverage \nin the small towns was 21%, while sanitation coverage in the form of pour-flush toilets or septic \ntanks was about 69%.3 \n \n5.  The importance of water supply and sanitation services in small towns is increasing as the \nLao PDR becomes more connected to other countries by better road networks, increased tourism, \nand expanded interregional trade. The growing significance of small towns is evidenced by (i) the \nincreasing  share  of  industry  and  services  in  the  gross  domestic  product;  \n(ii) an urban population growth rate of 4.0% (2003\u20132005), and greater rural-to-urban migration in \nall provinces; and (iii) the Government\u2019s socioeconomic development strategies, which emphasize \nsmall town development. \n  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  Socioeconomic  and  Poverty  Indicators.  Although  there  has  been  consistent \nimprovement in most socioeconomic indicators over the past few years, Lao PDR remains one \n                                                 \n1  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Small Towns Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila. Subsequent support was provided from the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility to develop a plan for corporatizing water supply utilities (PNPs) in Lao PDR. \n3  The figure for the small towns\u2019 piped water supply coverage is based on Water Supply Authority (WASA) 2006 data, \nand the figure for urban sanitation is based on socioeconomic and reconnaissance surveys for 37 small towns, with \nan average population of about 6,400, carried out under the Northern and Central Regions Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project and the Project. \n ", "2   \n \nof the world\u2019s least-developed countries, as it was ranked 130 among 177 countries.4 Poverty \nincidence decreased from 46% in 1992\u20131993 to 34% in 2002\u20132003 and 29% in 2005. However, \nremoteness and variations in access to basic infrastructure are key determinants of regional \ninequalities in the distribution of poverty. \n \n7.  Water and Sanitation Services. Overall access to safe water supply in urban areas is \nabout 67% (277,000 urban households), with 45% of urban households having access to piped \n5\nwater.  However, these figures mask significant differences in coverage among the five largest \ntowns (Vientiane, Kaysone Phomvihan, Pakse, Thakhek, and Louangphabang), which have a \ncombined piped water supply coverage of 70% and 140 small towns which have a combined \ncoverage of 21%. About 76% of urban households have pour-flush latrines, with 80% coverage \nin the five largest towns and about 69% in the small towns.6 About 74% of urban households in \nthe 15 towns covered by the Project have pour-flush pit latrines. While coverage of facilities is \nhigher in urban than in rural areas, sanitation goes beyond the basic infrastructure. Primary \nschools and public markets often have poor or no toilet facilities. A focus on urban water supply \nand sanitation will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the Lao PDR Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs)\u2014specifically goal 7, target 7.10\u2014to halve, by 2015, the proportion \nof people without access to safe drinking water.  \n \n8.  Health and Hygiene Behavior. Low coverage of safe piped water supply, inadequate \nsanitation conditions, and poor hygiene practices affect life expectancy at birth, child nutrition, and \ninfant mortality. They increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, intestinal worm infections, dengue, \nand malaria. In Lao PDR, life expectancy at birth is low (63 years), child malnutrition (40%) and \ninfant mortality (62 per 1,000 live births) are high. Diarrheal disease is the second biggest cause \nof mortality in children and the third biggest among adults. In 2000, malaria was the main cause of \nmortality and morbidity (70% of the population is at risk). The poor are particularly vulnerable to \nhealth shocks because of the high cost of treating disease and lost work days for recovery. \nSchoolchildren (ages 5\u201314) are especially prone to intestinal helminths (62% prevalence in this \nage group), resulting in school absence. Girls are particularly affected, as they lack access to \nclean, safe toilets, and hand washing facilities. While greater availability of water makes it easier \nfor people to wash their hands regularly, on its own it will not reduce the risk of infection. Hygiene \npromotion directed at using soap when washing hands is required for behavior change.  \n \n9.  Government\u2019s Sector Strategy and Investment. The Sixth National Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP6) 7  covering  2006\u20132010  prioritizes  the  development  of  basic \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas,  including  the  expansion  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services, to accelerate broad-based economic growth. In 1999, a government policy \nstatement8 established an institutional framework and long-term vision for the sector. It set a \ntarget of 24-hour access to safe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by 2020. In \nSeptember 2008, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) approved an urban water \nsupply and sanitation sector road map that reflected the current reforms and reconfirmed the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term vision from 2008 to 2020. In 2004 and 2006, the urban water supply \n                                                 \n4  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  2007.

By developing small towns, the \nGovernment seeks to reduce poverty through economic growth and to improve geographical \nequity  in  urban  social  infrastructure.  The  updated  SIP  provides  a  balanced,  progressive \napproach  to  water  supply  in  the  Lao  PDR,  as  investments  are  prioritized  according  to \npopulation; poverty; location to a major road, growth corridor, or international border; tourism \npotential; and the provincial government\u2019s development priorities. The SIP 2004 prioritizes 112 \nsmall  towns  and  estimates  investment  needs  at  $103  million.  An  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation sector analysis and investment plan is in Appendix 2 and a detailed analysis is in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n10.  Sector  Institutions.  Under  the  1999  policy  statement,  the  MPWT  has  overall \nresponsibility for water and wastewater management systems in urban areas. The Department of \nHousing and Urban Planning (DHUP) in MPWT is responsible for urban water sector strategies \nand  plans,  technical  standards,  and  managing  the  long-term  capital  investment  program. \nProvincial departments of public works and transport (DPWT) are responsible for supervising \nsanitation  infrastructure  and  associated  regulations  in  the  province.  The  National  Center  of \nEnvironmental Health and Water Supply within the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for \nurban and rural environmental hygiene and rural water supply.  \n \n11.  The 1999 policy statement also established the Water Supply Authority (WASA) and made \na provision for a Water Supply Authority Regulatory Board under the MPWT to regulate and \ncoordinate activities in urban water supply, including water quality control. Further, the 1999 policy \nstatement mandated the decentralization of urban water supply and sanitation management from \nthe central to provincial governments. The urban water supply utility, Nam Papa Lao, was divided \ninto Nam Papa Vientiane Capital and 16 other  water supply utilities (PNPs). Each became a \nsemiautonomous state-owned enterprise (SOE) regulated by the Enterprise Law, 2005.9 The \nWater Supply Division (WSD) within DHUP has responsibility for strategic planning and the long-\nterm  management  of  the  sector.10 A  prime  minister\u2019s  decree  strengthens  the  institutional \nframework  for  regulating  urban  water  supply  operations 11  by  clarifying  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of WASA. It also called for the establishment of a Water Supply Regulatory \nCommittee  (WSRC)  to  oversee  WASA\u2019s  operations.  Recently,  MPWT  decided  to  make  the \nWSRC as sector regulator with WASA as its secretariat.  \n \n12.  A Draft Water Supply Law  has been under development since 2004 and is due for \napproval  by  2009.  It  received  initial  support  from  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  followed  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Water  and  Sanitation \nProgram for East Asia and the Pacific (WSP-EAP). The Water Supply Law will consolidate water \nsupply legislation, strengthen the legal basis for sanitation services, and clarify the regulatory \nenvironment for urban water supply operations.  \n \n13.  ADB Country Strategy and Program. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP), \n2007\u2013201112 is consistent with SEDP6. It supports the Government\u2019s priority sectors, with a \nfocus on improving the enabling environment for poverty reduction. It includes investment in \nmajor infrastructure projects, and focuses on sector governance and capacity, inclusive social \ndevelopment, and sustainability. Urban water supply and sanitation is a priority sector in the \nCSP, which focuses on improving the delivery and management of water supply and sanitation \n                                                 \n9  The Enterprise Law, 2005, supersedes the Business Law, 1994. An SOE may be corporatized or noncorporatized, \nin which the state has significant control, through full, majority, or significant minority ownership. \n10  Decision No. 8027/DHUP. \n11  Decree No. 191/PM, 2005. \n12  ADB. 2007. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132011): Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila. \n ", "4   \n \nservices in a financially sustainable manner in secondary and small towns. ADB\u2019s strategy in the \nwater  and  sanitation  sector  is  to  support  sector  reforms  and  capital  investments  in \nunderserviced small towns.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n14.  Key problems in the urban water supply and sanitation sector in the Lao PDR include a \nlack of sustainability, ineffective sector regulation, the challenge of transforming PNPs into profit-\nmaking corporatized business entities, limited institutional capacity, and high investment costs due \nto the location of water sources, geographical conditions, and dispersed populations. The financial \nsustainability of PNPs will depend on tariff structures and levels, the number of connections, the \nvolume of water sold, operational and management efficiency, cost recovery of investments, and \nleadership and capacity in the sector. Currently, PNPs operate at a loss because of their low \ntariffs, small number of connections, and poor managerial and operational performance. In the \npast, tariff levels have not been adjusted to cover the costs of operation and maintenance and \ndebt service. The combined annual financial losses incurred by PNPs in 2006 are estimated to \nhave been more than KN30 billion, which is greater than the government expenditure on health \nover the same period.13 \n \n15.  Unsustainably  low  tariffs  have  constrained  the  financial,  managerial,  and  operational \nautonomy of PNPs, and made it difficult for them to repay government loans. They have also \nresulted in poor technical and financial performance, bad service to consumers, and increased \nreliance on the Government for budget support. The 2004 water supply tariff policy14 describes a \npolicy framework for setting fair tariffs to meet the needs of different customers; however, tariffs \nrecommended  by  WASA  require  approval  from  the  provincial  government  through  the \nadministration committee (or the PNP board). In the past, provincial tariff levels have been set \nbelow the real cost of producing and distributing water, and have not covered operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs. There has been a lack of political willingness to set appropriate \ncharges for piped water, since water has often been seen as a social rather than an economic \ngood, and the provision of piped water as a social service rather than a business. Major arrears \naccumulated because of late payments by government agencies have exacerbated the problem.   \n \n16.  The Project will support a provincial utility-wide progressive tariff structure with three \nconsumption blocks (lifeline, middle, highest). Tariffs will be set at levels that will enable (i) \nrecovery  of  full  O&M  costs,  and  gradually  increasing  depreciation;  and  \n(ii) maintenance of a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2:1. The tariff structure is in line with \ngovernment policy and has been used in previous ADB water projects in Lao PDR. It will make \ntariffs affordable for all customers by spreading the cost of piped water over the entire customer \nbase of a PNP, and is conducive to improving PNPs financial performance and sustainability. It \nalso will help PNPs to lower their administrative costs through the use of a single billing system.15 \nUnder the ongoing NCRWSSP, tariffs adjustments have been linked to disbursements and \ncontract awards, to help improve the financial performance of PNPs. As of May 2008, all 16 \nPNPs raised their tariffs following the WASA\u2019s tariff review (2008\u20132010).16  \n \n                                                 \n13 WASA. 2007. Annual Urban Water Performance Report 2006. Vientiane.  \n14  Ministerial Decision No. 5336/MCTPC on Water Supply Tariff Policy of the Lao PDR (26 April 2004). \n15  Sector work compared the provincial utility-wide progressive tariff structure to other tariff structures. \n16 Two PNPs and Vientiane Capital will have positive returns on capital (5%) by 2010, six PNPs will achieve cost \nrecovery and partial return on capital, and the remaining eight PNPs will recover more than 50% of depreciation \n(WASA 2006). \n ", "  5\n17.  Establishing Corporate PNPs. While PNPs are state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under \nthe Enterprise Law, 2005 they are required to amend their registration certificates to become state \ncompanies. Many do not operate as business units because of (i) low awareness of the business \naspects of SOEs among provincial governments and PNPs; (ii) lack of autonomy from provincial \ngovernments and other political influences; and (iii) poor operational and financial performance. A \nnumber of prime minister\u2019s implementation orders have been issued to support reforms of SOEs.17 \nUnder the Project, the Government will cause a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to be signed \nbetween the relevant Office of the Provincial Governor (OPG) and the relevant PNP. The MOA \nwill help implementation of the Enterprise Law by covering working arrangements, performance \nindicators and targets, delegation of authority for tariffs, and management. It will set tariffs at \nlevels that will enable PNPs to recover the costs of O&M, debt servicing, and gradually increasing \nlevels of depreciation. It will also include minimum service level targets, regulatory reporting and \nfunding arrangements, and possibly an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism. 18 The Project will \nscale-up efforts to develop PNP capacity in corporate planning, financial management, and \nO&M of water systems.  \n \n18.  Establishing  a  Credible  and  Effective  Regulatory  System.  The  absence  of  legal \nrecognition of the roles of WSRC and WASA has adversely affected the overall regulation \nsystem. Since 1999, the Government has made efforts to establish a regulatory system and to \nstrengthen the institutions in the urban water supply sector. WASA has prepared key financial, \nmanagement, technical and regulatory accounting guidelines, facilitated private sector water \nsupply initiatives, carried out tariff reviews in 2004 and 2007, and published regular annual \nperformance reports. These reports have included regulatory reporting and comparisons over \ntime in order to achieve greater public accountability. However, WASA is still located in the DHUP \nin MPWT and continues to engage in project-related and sector development activities. The \ndelay in issuing WASA\u2019s mandate and establishing the WSRC has left a void in the effective \nregulation of the urban water supply sector, since no single entity exists to take over the \nregulatory functions, including complaints or grievances from consumers and PNPs. Ongoing \ndialogue  on  SOE  reform  and  governance  will  help  increase  awareness  and  support  for \nautonomous sector regulation. The Project will support moving the WSRC and WASA outside \nDHUP  as  a  first  step  toward  an  effective  regulatory  system.  The  WSRC  will  originally  be \ncomprised  of  government  officials,  but  will  eventually  include  members  from  industry  and \nconsumers. The Project, together with other partners, will strengthen the capacity of the WSRC \nfollowing its establishment. The roles and responsibilities of WSRC, WASA, and the WSD are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n19.  Limited Resources for Sector Planning and Development. Limited resources constrain \nthe long-term development and sustainability of the water supply and sanitation sector. The WSD \nin DHUP is primarily engaged in project management and has limited capacity or staff for sector \nplanning and development. Under the Project, WSD will receive support to strengthen sector \nplanning and development. Provincial departments of public works and transport (DPWT) have \nmore experience in road development than in water supply and sanitation. District regulations for \nsanitation management and information workshops will strengthen the capacity of the DPWT to \n                                                 \n17  No. 28/PM (22 November 2004) Order of the Prime Minister on State-Owned Enterprise Reform, and No. 682/PM \n(15 May 2006) Prime Minister Notice on State-Owned Enterprises Management and Reform. \n18  In the NCRWSSP, the MOA includes a copy of the subsidiary loan agreement between MOF and the PNP with loan \namount and conditions, repayment obligations and amortization schedule, tariffs principles and annual minimum tariff \nadjustments, arrears collection plans, and connection policy. \n ", "6   \n \nplan and develop provincial water supply and sanitation services. The Project will support the \nissuance of district sanitation regulations in towns not covered by the NCRWSSP.19 \n \n20.  A Lack of Qualified Water Supply Engineers. A lack of water supply engineers inhibits \nthe operations of the PNPs, particularly in remote provinces where it is difficult to attract and \nretain skilled staff. Most PNPs have only one water supply engineer on their staff. About 55 civil \nengineers graduate from Lao universities each year, but only 2\u20133 of these follow a career in the \nwater industry, which is not sufficient to replace those retiring from the industry. A preliminary \nanalysis revealed that an additional 106 water supply or environmental engineers (or 14 per \nyear) will be required by 2015\u2014four times the current rate of supply.20 The Project will assist \nWSD to develop a human resources strategy and to provide direct financial assistance in the \nform of scholarships for water supply and environmental engineers. At least 30% of these \nscholarships will be allocated for female engineers. \n \n21.  Limited Opportunities for Women\u2019s Involvement. There are limited opportunities for \nwomen to engage in water and sanitation activities. The pool of qualified women engineers is \nlimited, as few enter the field after completing high school. Only 20% of all PNP staff are women \nand most of these work in finance, customer services and administration, with only a few in \ntechnical  positions.  There  is  limited  gender  awareness  or  understanding  of  the  potential \ncontributions and roles of women in water and sanitation management within the PNPs. Hence, \nwomen\u2019s opportunities for career advancement within PNPs are limited. The Project includes \nincentives  to  encourage  female  high  school  graduates  to  pursue  higher  education  in \nenvironmental engineering. Training in specific skills and capacity development is included to \nhelp PNPs to incorporate gender activities and opportunities into their corporate plans. \n \n22.  High Investment Costs for Conventional Technology. Initial investment costs in small \ntown water supply schemes in Lao PDR are higher than in neighboring countries because of the \nlocations of the towns, their limited economies of scale, and the need to import construction \nmaterials and skilled labor. The most appropriate technology for each town is dictated by the \navailable water sources, the geography of the town, and the distribution of its population. For \nexample, over 50% of towns will need to pump raw water, which will have to be fully treated in a \nmodern water treatment plant.21 The Project will adopt the most appropriate technology and \ndesign criteria, by focusing water supply services on the most densely populated villages. \nRealistic  and  flexible  unit  water  supply  consumption  will  be  used  for  the  system  design. \nBecause the O&M of these systems require greater technical skill than a low-technology gravity \nspring source or treatment by slow sand filters, each PNP\u2019s ability to manage, operate and \nmaintain the system will be assessed before a subproject is approved for funding to determine \nwhether service contracts will be needed to help the PNP operate and maintain the system in \nthe first year following commissioning.  \n \n23.  Inadequate Raw Water Assessments. Data on water quality and flows for raw water \nsources are inconsistent or nonexistent in most of the small towns. The method of assessing raw \nwater flows and raw water quality varies across PNPs. A high proportion of the water supply \nsystems developed in previous projects have failed to meet their design targets because of \ninadequate  raw  water  assessments  at  the  design  stage.  This  lack  of  data  represents  a \nsubstantial risk that subprojects will be delayed and investments will be ineffective. The Project \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Northern and Central Regions Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \nManila (Grant 0016-LAO, $24,900,000, approved 25 August). \n20  Source: Lao National University and WSD Director, July 2007. \n21  The base cost of small town water supply systems in Lao PDR range from $80 to $170 per capita. \n ", "  7\nwill provide training for PNP staff to improve their assessment methodology and to enable them \nto monitor raw water flows and water quality over at least three dry and wet seasons prior to \nconstruction.  \n \n24.  Utilization Rate of Plant Capacity. On average, 84% of the design capacity is utilized \nfor all existing PNP systems (75% excluding Vientiane).22 This is comparable with that of Viet \nNam  (60%  for  small  towns).  The  utilization  rate  during  the  first  few  years  following \ncommissioning is influenced by the small number of connections, the design criteria (systems \nare often designed for 15 years), and the availability of alternative water sources. The number of \nconnections affects the volume of water sold and the revenues generated by PNPs to cover the \ncapital cost of investment. The high cost of connections has also acted as a deterrent for \nhouseholds, particularly poor and low-income households, to connect to the piped water supply \nsystem.23 The Project will waive upfront connection fees (equivalent to $100\u2013$150 per metered \nconnection) for domestic consumers and adopt a new approach based on a monthly fee that \ncovers  water  consumption,  turnover  tax,  and  administration.  Under  the  NCRWSSP,  this \napproach increased the demand for connections to more than 90% at the time of construction.  \n \n25.  Lack  of  Household  Sanitation  Options  and  Poor  Hygiene.  Although  sanitation \ncoverage is high in most of the towns, the quality of these facilities is questionable and this, \ncombined with low hygiene awareness and promotion, limits the impact on health. Household \nsanitation facilities often vary because of weak sanitation regulations and unclear institutional \nresponsibilities, as individual property owners are responsible for developing and managing their \non-site sanitation systems. Little attention is paid to stagnant water or moist ground, which can \nlead to breeding of mosquitoes or parasites. The Project will work within the district regulations for \nsanitation  management  to  offer  a  range  of  sanitation  options,  covering  on-site  government-\napproved  systems.  It  recognizes  that  sanitation  development  follows  a  series  of  steps  for \nincremental improvement, and the decision on the most appropriate technical option will depend \non  a  range  of  factors,  including  affordability,  population  density,  household  preferences, \navailability  of  water  supply,  ground  conditions,  and  the  status  of  the  existing  water  and \nsanitation infrastructure24 (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n26.  Limited Private Sector Participation. The number of public\u2013private partnerships in the \nwater supply sector in Lao PDR remains low, largely because of weak legal and regulatory \nsystems. The introduction of the Enterprise Law, which has simplified registration procedures, is \nan important encouragement to greater private sector involvement. The establishment of the \nWSRC will be another important step. The Project will explore the potential for cooperation \nbetween the PNPs and private companies, e.g., through the use of concession contracts in towns \nwhere small private providers operate informal piped water supply systems. The models selected \nwill be based on those used by other development partners with experience in promoting water \nand sanitation partnerships in the Lao PDR. \n \n27.  Strengthening Cooperation with the Ministry of Health. Cooperation between MPWT \nand  MOH  at  the  central  level  has  been  limited  as  the  ministries  have  separate  roles  and \nresponsibilities for water supply and sanitation. The MOH is mandated to monitor the quality of \nhousehold drinking water provided by entrepreneurs, including the PNPs, while the MPWT is \n                                                 \n22  A plant utilization factor was developed to review production capacity with respect to age (or system) and town category. \n23  Under the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (footnote 29), connection levels were about 60% of those \nprojected in feasibility studies. The designs also underestimated the quantities of small bore reticulation pipes. \n24 The MPWT is currently drafting an urban wastewater strategy and investment plan (2008\u20132020). \n ", "8   \n \nresponsible for clarifying the frequency of water quality testing. The draft Water Supply Law \nreinforces the MOH\u2019s mandate to monitor drinking water quality standards.25 \n \n28.  Improving Development Partner Coordination. Although significant investments have \nbeen made by ADB and other development partners in urban water supply and sanitation since \nthe  1990s,  there  is  no  formal  mechanism  to  help  the  Government  coordinate  development \npartner-supported activities in the sector. The Project will support the WSD in the DHUP to \nconvene development partner consultation meetings twice a year and to establish a project and/or \nsector website, which will include project information and will be linked to the MPWT website.  \n \nC.  Other Development Partner Assistance \n29.  Several development partners provide assistance to the urban water supply and sanitation \nsector (Appendix 3).26 The ongoing NCRWSSP is a project supported by ADB, the Organization \nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development (OFID), Norwegian \nAgency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD),  and  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgramme (UN-HABITAT). A French water utility (SEDIF) promotes private investment in the \nurban  water  supply  and  through  a  nonprofit  association,  the  Research  and  Technological \nExchange Group (GRET), which provides output-based subsidies targeted at the poor. GRET is \nassisting  MPWT  to  implement  private  water  supply  concessions.  NORAD  has  provided \nsubstantial assistance to develop the capacity of WASA and WSD, and has been a key partner for \nprevious and ongoing ADB projects. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided \nfunds to develop Vientiane\u2019s water system and assistance in building the capacity of PNPs. \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) has also supported capacity development for PNPs \nthrough  the  construction  of  the  Waterworks  Technology  Training  Center  in  Vientiane  and \ndevelopment of training courses. UN-HABITAT is assisting MPWT to develop community-based \npiped  water  supply  schemes  in  small  towns.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  WSP-EAP,  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and UN-HABITAT are key \npartners  in  hygiene  awareness  and  promotion  in  communities  and  schools.  ADB  and  the \nInternational Finance Cooperation (IFC) are also working with the Government to implement the \nEnterprise Law and the World Bank and the IFC are supporting SOE governance and reform.  \n \nD.  ADB Experience in the Sector and Lessons \n30.  ADB has been engaged in the urban water supply sector since 1974. It reengaged in the \nearly 1990s, with the Southern Provincial Towns Water Supply Project (1991); Rehabilitation \nand Upgrading of the Vientiane Water Supply Project (1992); and the Northern Provincial Towns \nWater Supply (1993). 27 ADB lending has evolved to sector investment projects to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s emerging needs in the decentralized water supply sector. As of 2008, ADB had \n                                                 \n25  Ministry of Health. 2005.

Evaluations of the water supply and sanitation sector in Lao PDR have been completed, \nincluding  a  country  assistance  program  evaluation  in  2006,  which  rated  the  sector  partly \nsuccessful.28 The evaluation identified the need to avoid (i) inappropriate technology for water \ntreatment plants which disregard local conditions, especially where geological and environmental \nconditions are different; (ii) problems of financial sustainability associated with high water loss and \nlow tariff rates; (iii)  poor design and construction of systems; (iv) inadequate provision for staff training \nat water utilities and engineering consulting services for design and supervision; (v) high O&M costs; \nand (vi) underutilization of water treatment capacity because of the small number of connections.  \n \n32.  Since 1999, ADB has provided support for two sector investment projects. Assistance \nhas focused on water supply development and sanitation improvements in small towns, and \nstrengthening decentralized PNPs and sector institutions in policy, planning, management and \nregulation. The Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (WSSSP) was the first of these \nsector  investment  projects.29 It  constructed  water  supply  systems  in  15  small  towns  and \nrehabilitated systems in three other towns from 2000 to 2007. The project completion report \n(PCR) rated the project partly successful. By 2007, the WSSSP had helped to increase overall \nwater supply coverage in targeted small towns to 60% and sanitation coverage by 12%. Phase \n1 towns, commissioned by mid-2004, reached the 80% coverage target for piped water supply \nby 2008. The PCR identified the need to avoid (i) noncompliance with financial covenants, \nespecially those related to water tariff increases, cash balance and audit, debt service ratio, and \nseparate depreciation schedules; (ii) low connection rates because of high upfront connection \ncharges; (iii) low awareness by PNPs of their loan obligations under the project; and (iv) low \nlevels of community participation in project implementation.30 While disbursement performance \nwas  satisfactory,  the WSRC  was  not  established  and the  corporatization  process  had  not \nbegun. Lessons from the WSSSP have been incorporated into the design of the Project. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s second sector investment project was the ongoing NCRWSSP, which is expected \nto develop water supply systems in about 12 small towns by 2010. It incorporated some of the \nlessons from the WSSSP during initial project implementation. For instance, each PNP is required \nto sign a subsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance and a MOA with the respective \nOPG before disbursing funds for subprojects. Each PNP was also required to adjust its tariffs to \nWASA recommended levels before processing new projects. Lessons from previous projects are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n34.  The impact of the proposed Project will be a contribution to the Government\u2019s efforts to \nexpand access to safe piped water supply for the urban population to 65% by 2014 and 80% by \n                                                 \n28  ADB. 2006.

The Project will improve the quality of life in small towns and enhance their role as \neconomic,  market,  manufacturing  and service centers  for their surrounding rural areas.  The \noutcome will be an improvement in the access, quality, and reliability of the water supply and \nsanitation services for an estimated 137,000 residents in 124 villages in 15 small towns. By 2014, \nthe Project is expected to have increased access to piped water in the subproject towns to 55% \nand urban sanitation to 90%. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \n35.  The Project is designed as a sector investment project, representing a 3-year time slice of \nthe Government\u2019s sector investment plan to 2020. It meets the criteria for sector lending as (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s 1999 water sector policy statement remains valid and relevant; (ii) an updated \nsector investment plan is in place, providing a balanced, incremental approach to water supply \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR and outlining sector investment requirements to 2020; and (iii) \nMPWT, the Executing Agency, has enough capacity to implement piped water and sanitation \nprojects, as it has demonstrated since the early 1990s. The project design is based on detailed \nanalysis of three subproject towns, which are representative of other small towns in terms of the \ntype of interventions and impacts. Under the Project, subprojects that meet the eligibility criteria \nand PNPs that demonstrate their commitment to tariff reform and corporatization will be included. \n \n36.  Twenty-six towns were initially nominated from the sector investment plan and further \nprioritized  based  on  criteria  reflecting  Government\u2019s  priorities,  policy  objectives  and  data \nassessments for all towns. As a result, 21 towns were ranked first and second priority, and \nassumed eligible for financing provided that sufficient funds are available, and that the subprojects \ncomply with the project eligibility criteria. On average, small towns with a projected population \ngreater than 4,000 people by 2015 will be considered for inclusion. Financing under the Project is \navailable for an estimated 15 towns, including support for minor rehabilitation works in three \ntowns. Of the 15 top-ranked candidate subproject towns, five are in the poor and poorest districts. \nThe 15 top-ranked towns are geographically concentrated\u2014eight are located in the north, two are \nin the central region, and five are in the south. All 15 towns are situated within key transport and \neconomic corridors and seven are key tourism destinations, and near international borders. A \ngeneral feasibility study for the 21 towns is in Supplementary Appendix D. Information on town \nprioritization and the subproject selection criteria and procedures for small towns is in Appendix 4.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n37.  The Project has six integrated outputs: (i) strengthened sector planning, management, \nand regulation; (ii) developed and rehabilitated water supply systems; (iii) improved drainage \nand public sanitation; (iv) enhanced community action and participation in the urban water \nsupply sanitation sector; (v) enhanced gender equity in urban water supply and sanitation; and \n(vi) improved capacity for project implementation and operation and maintenance. The Project \nwill complement initiatives by other development partners and will build on the two earlier ADB-\nfunded water sector projects. It will closely follow the design of the NCRWSSP, with some \nmodification to the project design and added features. \n1.  Strengthened Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector  \n38.  This output will result in a strengthened and more sustainable urban water supply sector, \nbuilding on previous and ongoing assistance from ADB and other development partners. The \nProject will (i) strengthen the institutional capacity of WSD, WSRC and WASA, and DPWT to \nenable them to plan, regulate, and manage the sector effectively; (ii) support PNPs become more \nsustainable; and (iii) develop a human resources strategy and scholarship program for water \nsupply engineers.  \n ", "  11\n \n39.  After the WSRC has been established, the Project will assist WSRC and WASA regulate \nand monitor the sector effectively. It will support WSRC and WASA (i) develop and implement an \nannual consultation plan to increase the awareness of the importance of sector regulation among \nministries, provincial governments, and PNPs; (ii) guide PNPs to develop corporate plans to \ninclude key regulatory aspects; (iii) assist PNPs to develop an operating and regulation contract \n(as part of  the  MOA);  (iv) prepare a  PNP  water  quality reference sheet  which clarifies the \nassessment methodology and frequency of collection of raw water flows and MOH\u2019s water quality \nparameters; (v) assist PNPs to incorporate a mechanism for monitoring consumer complaints into \ntheir corporate plans; and (vi) prepare the tariff review for 2011\u20132013 and annual reports on PNP \nperformance. The Project will also support the development of the regulatory system during the \ninitial years by (i) assisting WSRC to meet twice a year and to prepare an annual report on its \nregulatory activities; and (ii) assisting WASA to prepare biannual progress reports for the WSRC.  \n \n40.  The Project will strengthen WSD\u2019s capacity to plan, manage and formulate policy for the \nurban water supply sector. Assistance will be provided to (i) develop the urban water supply and \nsanitation sector strategy 2009\u20132020 based on a sector road map (2008\u20132020); (ii) develop \nguidelines  to  facilitate  private  sector  investment;  (iii) establish  a  mechanism  for  enhanced \ninteragency and development partner coordination; (iv) develop a human resources strategy \nand scholarship program; (v) engage in sector planning and development activities related to \nthe preparation of PNP corporate plans; and (vi) update the sector investment plan, as needed.  \n \n41.  Participating PNPs will be supported to improve their performance and sustainability as \ncorporate entities under the Enterprise Law by developing their capacity in business and financial \nmanagement, commercial orientation, and operational efficiency. The Project will assist each \nPNP  to  (i)  undertake  an  initial  assessment  of  its  organizational  performance  and  needs; \n(ii) identify constraints to sustainable operation; (iii) reach consensus on needed actions and \nreforms;  (iv)  formulate  and  implement  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  rapidly  improve  PNP \nperformance and sustainability;31 and (v) prepare a rolling 3-year corporate plan incorporating \nthe action plan. The PNP corporate plans will provide a road map for transforming individual \nPNPs into more efficient, commercially oriented, autonomous water supply companies.32 The \nProject will also support each PNP to improve its understanding of women\u2019s roles in the sector. \n \n42.  Four  PNPs  are  being  corporatized  under  the  NCRWSSP:  Oudomxai,  Xaignabouli, \nLouangphabang,  and  Louang-Namtha.  The  NCRWSSP  will  provide  financial  software  and \ntraining in billing, accounting, stock management, and depreciation accounts to help PNPs \nmanage  the  greater  revenues  generated  by  recent  tariff  increases  and  to  demonstrate  to \nconsumers that service levels are improving in line with the tariff increases.  \n \n43.  The Project will extend this support to additional PNPs. About 12 PNPs are expected to \nreceive support under the Project, including continued support to the four PNPs supported by the \nNCRWSSP. Each participating PNP will receive support for 3 years, depending on each one\u2019s \nprogress  toward  corporatization.  Contract  awards  and  disbursement  for  water  supply \ndevelopment for the relevant subproject town will depend on the achievement of key milestones in \nthe corporatization process for each PNP (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n                                                 \n31  Actions  include  restructuring  and  improving  efficiency  through  immediate  technical  improvements,  reducing \nnonrevenue water, improving revenue collection, implementing an arrears collection strategy, and adjusting tariffs. \n32 This includes (i) a mission statement and corporate objectives; (ii) standards, performance indicators and targets; \n(iii) tariffs; (iv) market analysis; (v) PNP management and organization (e.g., staff incentives); (vi) an action plan \nand detailed activities; (vii) a 3-year financial forecast; and (viii) a capital investment program for staged water \nsupply development.  \n ", "12  \n \n44.  The Project will produce a human resources development strategy for the urban water \nsupply sector. The strategy will help WSD to coordinate development partner-supported capacity \ndevelopment programs within the sector human resources framework; evaluate such programs for \ntheir  effectiveness  and  achievement  of  outcomes;  and  ensure  that  lessons  identified  are \nincorporated into new programs. The strategy will include merit-based and employment-linked \nscholarships to (i) increase the supply of qualified water supply engineers and environmental \nengineers; (ii) upgrade technical and management skills of existing staff; and (iii) increase the \nnumber  of  female  engineering  graduates.  For  engineering  students  who  have  successfully \ncompleted at least 3 years of a 5-year engineering bachelor course, scholarships will be available \nfor  the  final  2  years  to  enable  them  to  complete  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree  in  environmental \nengineering.33 These scholarships will be open to all applicants. Scholarship candidates among \ncurrent MPWT or PNP staff will be nominated by DHUP, DPWT, or PNPs with a commitment by \nthe employer and the recipient of the scholarship to continue employment for at least 5 years. At \nleast 30% of these scholarships will be reserved for qualified women. The Project will assist WSD \nto (i) develop detailed eligibility criteria and procedures for the scholarship program, including the \nestablishment  of  a  scholarship  selection  committee;  and  (ii)  administer  and  implement  the \nscholarship program over 2010\u20132014 (Supplementary Appendix F).  \n \n2.  Developed and Rehabilitated Water Supply Systems  \n \n45.  The Project will support the development and rehabilitation of safe, affordable, reliable \npiped water systems in 15 small towns, including (i) surface, spring, or groundwater sources; (ii) \nraw water transmission; (iii) a distribution and reticulation pipework; (iv) service reservoirs; (v) \nindividual metered service connections; and (vi) O&M equipment. To ensure that the investment \nis efficient, the subprojects will focus on the most densely populated areas in the villages. Water \ntreatment  plants  will  be  designed  for  water  demands  in  2025,  and  levels  of  service  and \nstandards will  be adapted  to local  conditions  to  avoid overinvestment.  Design  criteria  and \nservice levels will aim to optimize capital and long-term O&M costs.  \n \n46.  Water supply rehabilitation will include minor improvements to existing water supply \nsystems to enhance their reliability or water quality. Towns that have asked for assistance for \nsystem expansion, capacity augmentation, and rehabilitation works resulting from a lack of O&M \nare not eligible for support. Three subprojects are nominated for rehabilitation (Huoixai, Vang \nVieng, and Saravane), with investment limited to about $150,000 per town. The scope of works \nincludes (i) construction of a raw water reservoir to supplement dry season flows (Huoixai); \n(ii) development of a supplementary source of supply to remedy dry season water shortages \nand  water  treatment  plant  improvements  to  enhance  water  quality  (Vang  Vieng);  and \n(iii) relocation of raw water intake to avoid a polluted water source (Saravane). The rehabilitation \nsubprojects will include a small amount for O&M equipment and community information and \nparticipation, but will not be eligible for drainage or village environmental improvements.34 \n \n47.  New or rehabilitated water supply systems will be designed and constructed to meet the \nservice levels that are in line with government policy and guidelines and were adopted by the two \nprevious ADB sector investment projects: (i) safe water that meets MOH drinking water quality \nstandards;35 (ii) 24-hour continuous supply; (iii) 10 meter minimum pressure at the point of service \nin  the  distribution  network;  and  (iv)  individual  house  connections  with  meters.  New  water \ntreatment plants will be designed for water demands in 2025 based on (i) per capita consumption \n                                                 \n33  Environmental engineering courses include water supply, wastewater, drainage, sanitation and solid waste management. \n34  These aspects are covered by ADB. 2002.

An \nassessment of the operational capacity of the PNP will be required as part of each feasibility study \nto determine whether PNPs will be required to enter into service contracts with experienced \noperators. System-specific O&M manuals that are being developed under the NCRWSSP for \neach water supply system will be adapted to the requirements of each system. Feasibility studies \nfor three sample subprojects have been prepared\u2014Songkhone, Viengphoukha, and Huoixai. \nPhysical works for the three sample subprojects are described in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n48.  Domestic  households  will  not  pay  any  up-front  charges  for  household  metered \nconnections. However, they will be required to enter into an agreement to pay a monthly fee that \ncovers  water  supply  consumption,  turnover  tax,  and  basic  administration.  Commercial  and \ninstitutional consumers will pay for connections at the full cost of labor and materials. \n \n3.  Improved Drainage and Public Sanitation \n \n49.  The Project will improve drainage and public sanitation in the villages that were selected \nfor new water supply.  \n \n50.  Drainage works will include the construction or improvement of primary and secondary \ndrains,  roadside  drains,  culverts,  and  outlets.  New  water  supply  systems  will  require \nimprovements to existing drainage systems to make the systems compatible and to help relieve \nminor flooding and ponding and reduce health risks associated with stagnant water. The Project \nwill provide equipment for management and O&M of drainage in the towns, including computers \nand software, workshop and minor construction tools, and other equipment. Priority will be given \nto primary, secondary, and roadside drains in commercial centers or densely populated areas to \nensure the investment is efficient, and that the works are economically viable. Investment will be \nlimited to about $80,000 in each town receiving a new water supply system.  \n \n51.  The Project will provide sanitation in public areas. Public sanitation in market areas will be \nencouraged in all subproject towns with new water supply systems, especially those with high \ntourism  potential.  Investment  will  be  limited  to  about  $45,000  per  town,  and  detailed  O&M \narrangements of the facilities (e.g., by kiosk owners in markets) will be agreed upon during \nfeasibility preparation.  \n \n4.  Enhanced Community Action and Participation  \n \n52.  The community action and participation program will facilitate community development \nand participatory planning to improve the environmental conditions of households and villages; \npromote integrated health and hygiene awareness; provide resources for small-scale investments \nfor households and villages; and coordinate project components in the villages. It promotes \nparticipation and benefits for small town residents in the 15 towns including women, ethnic groups \nand poor households. It consists of (i) community information and participation program (CIPP); \nand (ii) household sanitation improvements and village environmental improvements (VEI). \n  \n53.  The CIPP will give communities control over decisions and actions related to water, \nsanitation and environmental improvements. It will develop capacity to plan, design, operate, \nsupervise, and maintain small-scale infrastructure together with local authorities and agencies. It \nwill  support  health  and  sanitation  promotion  to  (i)  improve  the  basic  health,  hygiene  and \nsanitation knowledge of villagers; (ii) inform households about the benefits of piped water; and \n(iii) encourage households to install or improve their existing latrine facilities. The program will \n ", "14  \n \nsupport  information  campaigns  on  health,  sanitation  and  hygiene  in  schools  and  women\u2019s \ngroups and among the youth. Implementation of the program may be contracted out to the Lao \nWomen's Union (LWU) at the district level, a quasi-government institution, which will work \nclosely with the district education and health departments. This will help to build the capacity of \nLWU, ensure sustainability of the awareness activities, and ensure coordination with overall \nproject activities, as the LWU is represented in project implementation units (PIUs). \n \n54.  Village environmental improvements will adopt a demand-driven approach and will provide \nfunding and technical assistance for communities to (i) improve household sanitation facilities; and \n(ii) undertake priority small-scale community improvements related to water, sanitation, and village \nenvironmental conditions (such as community drainage and public toilets in schools). A household \ngrant of $100 will be provided to each poor household36 connected to the water supply system to \nconstruct or improve pour-flush latrines. A smaller amount will be provided to households who \ndecide not to connect, but wish to improve their toilet facilities. Priority will be given to ethnic \ngroups without previous access to sanitation facilities. The sanitation grant is expected to provide \n1,400 households with toilet facilities in the subproject towns with new water supplies.  \n \n55.  Community needs and priorities for village environmental improvements will be identified \nthrough a participatory process in each village, and facilitated by the LWU in each district. Each \nvillage development committee (VDC) will go through two rounds of planning and prioritization, \ndesign and implementation of small subprojects. Funding will be allocated through grants, \nallowing communities to prioritize one or more initiatives within this budget. The budget will be \ndisclosed to the communities at the start of the planning cycle. The Project will contribute up to \n80% of the cost of village environmental improvements, the provincial or district governments \nwill contribute about 10%, and the village will contribute at least 10% in the form of labor, \nmaterials, and/or cash. Each village will develop an O&M plan, including funding requirements \nand will enter into an agreement with the district office for public works and transport (OPWT) \nbefore any funds are released. The PIUs will provide engineering and financial management \nsupport to the VDCs to implement the small-scale investment program.  \n \n5.  Enhanced Gender Equity in Urban Water Supply and Sanitation  \n \n56.  The Project will enhance gender equity in urban water supply and sanitation, and will \ncontribute to women\u2019s empowerment by (i) providing scholarships to female school graduates to \nenable them to undertake engineering courses, (ii) increasing the attention paid to the role of \nwomen in water supply and sanitation management, and (iii) promoting better opportunities for \nwomen  in  PNPs.  The  Project  will  support  (i)  design  and  administration  of  20  merit-based \nscholarships for female high school graduates in 4-year diploma courses in water supply and \nenvironmental  engineering;  (ii)  gender  assessments  and  a  pilot  demand-driven  capacity \ndevelopment program for gender equality in PNPs; and (iii) knowledge management products \nhighlighting gender roles in the sector. The scholarships will be integrated into the overall human \nresources strategy and scholarships program, open to all female applicants, awarded according to \nagreed upon selection criteria, and subject to a review by a scholarships selection committee.  \n6.  Improved Capacity for Project Implementation and O&M  \n \n57.  The Project will make project implementation and operation and maintenance services more \nefficient. Technical, management and capacity development support will be provided to the project \ncoordination unit (PCU) and PIUs throughout the implementation period (2009\u20132014). The support \nwill cover such areas as project planning, management and coordination; preparation of feasibility \n                                                 \n36  Government instruction 010/PM/2001 defines poverty and identifies indicators at the household, village and district levels.  \n ", "  15\nstudies and procurement packages; design and construction supervision; contract management; \nbusiness and  corporate  planning;  financial  management and  accounting; and  institutional and \nhuman resources development. It will pilot appropriate PNP\u2013private sector cooperation models for \nwater supply extension. It will produce guidelines and manuals in Lao and English for the O&M of \nwater supply and sanitation, support external monitoring, and project auditing. \n \n58.  The capacity development program will (i) assist PNPs to manage, operate, and maintain \nthe completed water supply and sanitation services; and (ii) define the roles and responsibilities \nof PNPs, local government, and communities for managing, operating, and maintaining the \nwater and sanitation facilities. Capacity development and training activities for the branch PNPs \nand  OPWTs  will  focus  on  training  the  key  staff  responsible  for  managing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining  the  specific  infrastructure  system  and  equipment  provided  by  the  subproject. \nNational trainers from the Water Technical Training Center (WTTC) will be used to implement \ncapacity development program activities (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nC.  Special Features \n59.  A  Phased  Approach  to  Corporatizing  PNPs.  To  facilitate  the  steps  leading  to \ncorporatization,  key  actions  will  be  linked  to  disbursement  milestones.  Each  PNP  will  be \nrequired to carry out a set of immediate actions (e.g., tariff reviews, updated record of arrears \ncollected, and reduction in nonrevenue water) aimed at improving their operational performance \nand sustainability. Once a subproject has been selected, phase 1 of the corporatization process \nwill begin, which includes (i) initial awareness and support for corporatization, (ii) organization \nrestructuring and basic capacity development, and (iii) submission of corporate plans to the \nPNP board before contract awards. Approval of the plans will be needed before funds for water \nsupply investments are disbursed. A PNP with more than one subproject town will be required \nto update its corporate plan for approval before contract awards for the second town. The \nProject will promote coordination between the DHUP of the MPWT, the SOE of the Ministry of \nFinance, and the Business Promotion Office of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to strengthen the \nregulatory environment and improve the overall business and financial performance of PNPs. \n \n60.  A Flexible Approach to Water Supply Development. Subprojects will focus on the most \ndensely populated areas in the villages, and water treatment plants will be designed for water \ndemands in 2025.  Demand and  consumption projections were  based on  varying population \ngrowth rates, flexible demand projections, and particular geographic conditions. Design criteria \nand service levels aim to optimize capital and long-term O&M costs. Where protected spring \nsources have been identified, the design of the water treatment plant will be adjusted to local \nsource conditions. Specific O&M manuals will be developed for each water supply system. The \nProject also includes a provision for service contracts to support PNPs to manage, operate and \nmaintain new water supply systems for the first 12 months following commissioning.  \n \n61.  Demand-Driven  Household  and  Village  Sanitation  Improvements.  The  Project \nincludes  a  community  action  and  participation  program  to  enable  community  groups  and \nhouseholds to set their own priorities for improvements related to water, sanitation and the \nenvironment, and to use and manage infrastructure on the basis of collective resources and \ncontributions. Communities will have a greater sense of ownership and stronger management \nskills for (i) community planning, managing, operating, and maintaining small investments; and \n(ii) monitoring and evaluating participatory processes and outputs. Before funds are released, \neach village will prioritize the improvements it needs, develop an O&M plan, including funding \nrequirements and sourcing, and enter into an agreement with district authorities.  \n \n ", "16  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n62.  The project investment is estimated to be $31.4 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $2.1 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies. The project \ninvestment plan is in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 6. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n63.  It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $23.0 million from its Asian Development Fund \nresources.  The  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent to $500,000, to be administered by ADB. The Government of Australia will provide grant \ncofinancing equivalent to $5.3 million, to be administered by ADB. Government contributions will \ninclude an estimated $2.1 million for taxes and duties and $0.24 million for land acquisition and \ncompensation. Project beneficiaries are expected to contribute about $0.16 million, in the form of \nlabor, materials, or cash. The Government will lend each PNP part of the proceeds from the grants \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and from the Government of Australia, equal to 30% of the \ncapital investment costs of each PNP\u2019s water supply system, through a subproject loan agreement \nacceptable to ADB.37 The subproject loans will have a maturity of 25 years with a grace period of 6 \nyears, and a fixed interest rate of 6.4%. The balance of 70% of the cost will be provided from the \nsame sources to the PNPs as a grant.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n64.  Implementation  arrangements  will  be  similar  to  those  of  the  NCRWSSP,  with \nmodifications to improve efficiency and sustainability. MPWT will be the Executing Agency. The \nnational  project  steering  committee  (PSC) for the NCRWSSP will  oversee  the Project  and \nprovide policy guidance. The PSC chair will be the vice-minister of MPWT and the vice-chair the \nDHUP director general. It will include members from Business Promotion Office of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office, the Departments of Foreign Relations and of SOE Financial Management of the \nMinistry of Finance, the Department of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, and the PCU director. A subcommittee for corporatization of PNPs (with the PCU as \nits secretariat), chaired by the DHUP director general, will meet at least once every quarter.  \n \n65.  The existing PCU for the NCRWSSP will be expanded and will be responsible for overall \nplanning, coordination and management of both projects. The director will be assisted by two \ndeputy directors assigned to the STWSP. The PCU will be responsible for (i) overall project \nimplementation  and  coordination;  (ii)  recruiting  and  managing  consultants;  (iii)  recruiting  the \nagency for external monitoring of social, resettlement and environment impacts; (iv) procurement \nof civil works and goods (except those for outputs 3 and 4); (v) confirming the selection of \nsubproject towns based on the selection criteria; (vi) appraising key subproject documents before \nthey are forwarded to ADB for approval; (vii) providing technical and administrative assistance to \nPIUs;  (viii)  preparing  consolidated  project  progress  and  accounting  reports  and  the  project \ncompletion report for submission to ADB and the Government; (ix) providing all necessary data to \nthe auditor on time and submitting the audited financial statements of project accounts to ADB \nand the Government. The PCU will be supported by international and national consultants. \n \n66.  A provincial project steering committee (PPSC) in each province will guide subproject \nimplementation, coordinate provincial and district agencies, and make key decisions on behalf \nof the provincial government. The PPSC will be chaired by a provincial vice-governor and will \ninclude the subproject district governor, senior officials from DPWT, Department of Finance, \nDepartment of Health, PNPs, district office of the Public Works and Transport (OPWT), and the \nPIU manager. The PPSC will meet as required, but at least every 6 months. A PPSC will not be \nrequired in those provinces that have candidate rehabilitation works, unless the province is also \na candidate for a new water supply system. At the district level, the district governor or vice-\n ", "18  \n \ngovernor will oversee the project, monitor progress, review quality of the work, coordinate the \nsubproject with the PIU and local communities, and report on progress to the PPSC.  \n \n67.  The DPWT will be the implementing agency in each project province. The PIU manager \nand deputy manager in each province will be from the PNP or the DPWT (one from each). With \nassistance from the PCU, the PIU will be responsible for day-to-day coordination and supervision \nof project implementation in the project districts. The PIU will manage procurement for outputs 3 \nand 4 and will implement output 4 with full participation and decision-making of the VDCs. If the \nPIU wishes to contract the LWU at the district level for community information and participation \nprogram activities, the PIU will be responsible for verifying completion of the contracted activities \nprior to payment. Each PIU will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation at the local \nlevel and will include expertise in (i) administration and finance, (ii) water supply and sanitation; \nand (iii) community action and participation. The PIU will be responsible for implementing outputs \n3 and 4. Key responsibilities include (i) participating in project planning, feasibility studies, design, \nand  procurement  activities  for  the  province\u2019s  subproject;  (ii)  coordinating  the  activities  of \nconsultants  and  contractors  in  the  province;  (iii)  overseeing  construction  activities;  \n(iv) coordinating resettlement and assisting the resettlement committee; (v) implementing the \ngender  strategy  and  the  ethnic  groups  development  framework;  (vi)  supervising  capacity \ndevelopment activities at the local level; and (vii) preparing the subproject accounting, auditing, \nand monitoring reports to PCU and PPSC. The project management and fund flow is in Appendix \n7 and project implementation details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n68.  The Project is a sector investment project and will be implemented over a 5-year period \nfrom  June  2009  to  June  2014.  The  order  in  which  subprojects  are  implemented  will  be \ndetermined  by  agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  will  depend  on  (i)  the \nreadiness of the concerned provincial and district governments and PNPs to implement the \nsubprojects prioritized in the investment plan; (ii) compliance with the agreed eligibility criteria, \nincluding  confirmation  that  subproject  impacts  on  resettlement  and  the  environment  are \ninsignificant; and (ii) geographical grouping of the subprojects to minimize costs and maximize \nimplementation  efficiency.  For  each  subproject,  a  feasibility  and  appraisal  report38 will  be \nrequired. Subprojects will be implemented as soon as they are ready, but for reasons of cost, \nefficiency and expediency, it is expected that they will be prepared and implemented in groups \nof three to four. If a particular province and its PNP are not considered ready to implement the \nProject, the corresponding subproject will be assigned a lower priority for development, and the \nprovince and PNP will be required to take actions to enhance their readiness to implement \nbefore the subproject is approved for funding. WSD will develop detailed eligibility criteria and \nprocedures for the scholarship program during the early stages of project implementation so the \nprogram can be administered from 2010 to 2014. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n69.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over \n$1.0 million, and for supply contracts valued at over $500,000. Procurement of civil works valued \nat less than $1.0 million equivalent will be undertaken through national competitive bidding. \n                                                 \n38  Includes design concept and criteria reports, design standards and specifications, feasibility studies, required social \ndevelopment and safeguard documents, detailed designs and construction drawings, and procurement plans. \nPrequalification and bidding documents are prepared following subproject appraisal reports as detailed design. \n ", "  19\nModifications and clarifications that need to be made to the Recipient\u2019s national competitive \nbidding procedures must be agreed on by ADB and the Recipient. Shopping procedures will be \nfollowed for materials and equipment packages or works estimated to cost less than $100,000 \nequivalent. ADB shopping procedures will be used for the small village civil works and supply \ncontracts,  and  for  awareness  activities  and  equipment  under  the  community  action  and \nparticipation  program.  To  the  extent  possible,  quotations  will  be  invited  from  at  least  three \nsuppliers or contractors for local procurement. The PCU will carry out procurement for outputs 1, 2 \nand 5, and the PIU will be responsible for that for outputs 3 and 4. Installation of water meters and \nservice connections will be carried out by the construction contractor under the main water supply \nconstruction contract for each subproject town. The district LWU will be contracted to implement \nthe community information and participation program, following a capacity assessment in each \nsubproject town through single source selection. This is justified based on: (i) the LWU is the only \norganization with a sustained local presence in the project districts, and has a history of working \nwith local communities and participatory development, ensuring local continuity; and (ii) the cost of \neach assignment is less than $100,000. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n70.  A total of 859 person-months of consulting services (124 person-months international \nand 735 person-months national) will be required to support implementation of the Project \nthrough project management, feasibility studies, design construction, and supervision of water \nsupply and sanitation infrastructure, preparation of social assessments with information on \npoverty, gender and ethnic groups, financial management, institutional and human resources \ndevelopment, social and community development, health and hygiene, involuntary resettlement \nand  environmental  safeguards,  and  project  performance  management  and  evaluation.  The \nconsultants will deliver on-the-job training and capacity development assistance to the PCU and \nPIUs. They will also provide services for (i) topographical surveys for feasibility studies and \ndesign;  (ii)  water  quality  testing  for  feasibility,  design,  and  monitoring  during  construction; \n(iii) geotechnical investigations and soil testing for feasibility studies and design; (iv) survey and \nclearance of unexploded ordnance;39 and (v) groundwater surveys, if necessary, to include \ndrilling and pump tests. Consulting services will be engaged through a firm in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) through the \nquality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method. The weighting will follow the standard quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 80:20. The PCU will recruit the consultant team, which will include international and \nnational consultants led by a team leader. The consultant team will report to the PCU. The \nterms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n5.  Advance Action for Recruitment of Consultants \n \n71.  In keeping with the momentum of the current sector reforms and to help speed up \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  requested  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action does not in \nany way commit ADB to finance the Project itself, and that the action should be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n72.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \n                                                 \n39  Groundwater investigations and unexploded ordnance clearance will be included in the consultancy contract as \nprovisional cost items to be subcontracted because the scope of such works is uncertain. \n ", "20  \n \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n73.  In addition to the standard ADB requirements, the Project incorporates other measures to \ndeter corruption and increase transparency, including (i) establishment and periodic updating of \nan urban water supply and sanitation sector website, including a site dedicated to the Project, \nwhich  will  disclose  project  information  including  procurement  documents,  approved  PNP \ncorporate plans, signed subproject loan agreements and MOAs, and the selection criteria for the \nscholarship  program  and  list  of  scholarship  recipients;  (ii)  participation  by  the  VDCs  in  the \nprocurement committee for outputs handled by the PIUs; (iii) public posting of award contracts \nand monthly progress reports on community boards; and (iv) recruitment of an independent \nexternal  monitor  to  evaluate  social,  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts.  The  PNP \nadministration committee (or the PNP board) comprises the PNP manager and members from \nDPWT and other provincial departments of finance, planning and investment to oversee the PNP \nactivities, tariff reviews and adjustments, and the preparation and approval of corporate plans. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n74.  Payment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  grants  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nDirect payment procedures will be used for suppliers, contractors and consultants. To ensure \nthe timely release of grant proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Government \nwill, immediately upon grant effectiveness, open and maintain a project imprest account at the \nBank  of  Lao  for  disbursement  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be \nresponsible for establishing, managing, replenishing, and liquidating the account. In addition, \nthe PCU will set up a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) in dollars with a commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB.40The initial amount to be allocated to the imprest account will be \n \nbased on the estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest account for the first 6 \nmonths of project implementation, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The amount \nto be deposited into the SGIA will be based on the first 6 months of the projected expenditure of \nthe PCU to be funded from the SGIA, and will not exceed $500,000. A conduit subproject bank \naccount will be opened at each PIU level (estimated total of 15) for receiving fund remittances to \nmeet administration and recurrent costs of the PIUs, and will not exceed $5,000. Funding of \nsubproject accounts will be based on a prior submission of full documentation to the PCU. Other \nproject expenditures incurred by the PIUs will be paid and liquidated using the PCU\u2019s SGIA. The \nproject imprest account and SGIA will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the recipient and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures may be used for \nreimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating of advances to the imprest account and SGIA. \nThe maximum payment for any individual item using these procedures is $20,000 equivalent per \nindividual payment. Imprest accounts (including the SGIA) and subproject accounts will be \nmaintained according to different financing sources. The grant from the Government of Australia \nwill be disbursed on a pro-rata basis.  \n                                                 \n40  The SGIA will be set up upon grant effectiveness, and the conduit subproject account will be set up after the \nrelevant subproject is approved by ADB. New PIUs will receive training on disbursement arrangements, and \nexisting PCU and PIUs will receive refresher training. \n ", "  21\n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n75.  Each PIU will prepare quarterly project progress reports in a short standard format and \nsubmit them to the PCU for consolidation and reporting to the PSC, ADB, and cofinanciers. The \nprogress  reports  will  include  a  periodic  review  of  progress  against  the  training  needs \nassessment of PIUs. The reports will be in a form and detail satisfactory to ADB and the \ncofinanciers. Each PNP will prepare its annual financial statements, including the balance sheet, \nincome statement, and cash flow statement. The PCU will also submit to ADB, within 3 months \nof the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report that will cover the details of \nproject  implementation,  costs,  and  project  evaluation  activities  at  that  time,  and  other \ninformation requested by ADB. The report will highlight the development impacts achieved by \nthe Project, including an evaluation of resettlement activities and conditions of the affected \npersons after resettlement. Project and subproject accounts and financial statements, including \nthose of the PNPs, will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PCU and PIUs \nwill  prepare  the  required  information  for  audit,  including  information  on  resettlement \nimplementation, in accordance with project auditing requirements of the Government and ADB. \nAudited statements of project and subproject accounts and financial statements, including those \nof the PNPs, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB through the PCU \nwithin 6 months of the close of the fiscal year. The audit opinion will be based on the use of the \nimprest account (including the SGIA), and statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n76.  A comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME) \nacceptable to ADB will be carried out during implementation. It will aim to (i) examine the Project\u2019s \ntechnical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities;  (iii)  assess  the \nachievement of the Project\u2019s objectives; and (iv) measure the Project\u2019s social, economic, financial, \nand institutional impacts. The set of PPME indicators developed under the NCRWSSP is in line \nwith the MPWT indicators for urban water supply and sanitation. These indicators will be reviewed \nand additional ones (based on the design and monitoring framework) will be added at the start of \nproject implementation. Socioeconomic data will be disaggregated by sex and by ethnic group \nwhen possible. PIUs will be responsible for carrying out the PPME activities, including pre-project \nand post-project physical and socioeconomic surveys, data collection, and analysis. Each PIU will \nestablish a PPME baseline from the pre-project surveys and data. Annual PPME reports will be \nprepared by each PIU, and consolidated by the PCU for submission to ADB. MPWT will cause the \nPCU to submit a detailed PPME implementation plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 \nmonths of grant effectiveness. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n77.  In addition to regular reviews, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \nreview within (i) 1 year of grant effectiveness, at which time the detailed design for the first phase \nsubprojects will be substantially completed and significant progress should have been made \ntoward corporatizing the four PNPs; and (ii) 30 months from grant effectiveness (midterm review) \nat which time the establishment  and functioning of corporate PNPs and the  WSRC  will  be \nreviewed for recommendations. These reviews will include a comprehensive evaluation of project \nimplementation  arrangements,  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  the  actual \nimplementation progress, feedback from PPME program, performance of consultants, institutional \ndevelopment  progress,  and  possible  reallocation  of  grant  proceeds.  The  cost  recovery \nmechanisms for each subproject, the financial and operational performance of PNPs, and the \noverall sector regulatory system will also be evaluated. Remedial action will be taken as needed. \n \n ", "22  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n78.  Poverty and Social Benefits. The Project is expected to benefit an estimated 137,000 \nresidents in 124 villages in 15 small towns, by providing safe, reliable piped water, increasing \nhealth  and  hygiene  awareness,  and  improving  the  urban  environments.  About  13%  of  all \nbeneficiaries are expected to be poor. The Project will have a direct impact on the health and \nliving conditions of the communities. Residents of the small towns will benefit from improved \nhealth, savings in health care costs, and ultimately income benefits from expanded access to \npiped water and sanitation services. Ethnic groups in the participating towns will also benefit \nsignificantly from the improved water and sanitation facilities and services provided under the \nProject. Households from some ethnic groups are less likely to be connected to existing piped \nwater supply systems because of their cost and the location of their households. While 89% of \nhouseholds from the Lao-Tai group are connected to piped water, only 64% of households from \nminority ethnic groups are connected. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 10 and a detailed poverty and social analysis in Supplementary Appendix K. An ethnic \ngroups development framework is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n79.  Residents of the small towns will also experience health, education and income benefits \nfrom better access to water and sanitation, improved drainage and sanitation, and reduced \nincidence of flooding and polluted water in public areas. Water and sanitation-related diseases \ncontribute significantly to the poor health status of many women and children, including high infant \nmortality rates. Provision of sanitation facilities in public areas and schools will also improve \nenvironmental conditions and public health. Separate toilets and hand washing facilities for girls \nand boys in schools will help increase girls\u2019 enrollment and retention rates. Expanded water \nsupply and sanitation coverage in small towns with high tourism potential will improve their \nattractiveness as destinations (Appendix 11). \n \n80.  Gender Benefits. Water and sanitation are particularly important for women, who are \nprimarily responsible for family health and water collection and storage to meet daily household \nneeds and family health. Women spend up to 2 hours per day collecting and storing water. The \nProject will promote gender equity by (i) setting a minimum 30% target for female representation \nin the PIU and VDCs; (ii) supporting MPWT to recruit and promote women for leadership positions \nwithin the ministry and ensuring that at least 30% of scholarships in all categories are reserved for \nwomen;  (iii)  awarding  special  engineering  scholarships  to  female  high  school  graduates; \n(iv) increasing the number of qualified women in PNPs in technical and leadership positions by \n10%; (v) setting a target participation rate for women for all capacity development and training \nactivities at 40%; and (vi) implementing separate male and female awareness campaigns on safe \nwater use and hygiene. A gender action plan is in Appendix 12.   \n \n81.  Economic Benefits. Economic analyses of the three sample subprojects prepared for \nfeasibility (Songkhone, Viengphoukha and Houixai) were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water \nSupply Projects, and Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development \nSector Projects.41 Economic benefits of the water supply components will be derived from a safer, \nmore  reliable,  and  more  affordable  water  supply  in  the  subprojects.  Quantifiable  economic \nbenefits  of  the  improved  water  supply  services  include  benefits  from  nonincremental  water \nconsumption,  incremental  water  consumption,  and  other  resource  savings.  Drainage  and \n                                                 \n41  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 1998. Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila; ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of \nUrban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n ", "  23\nsanitation components will significantly reduce the incidence and severity of flooding, reduce \nponding of polluted water in public areas, provide sanitation facilities in public areas and schools, \nenhance environmental and living conditions, and improve public health. The economic internal \nrates of return in the three sample subprojects are well above the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital, which is assumed to be 12% (Songkhone is 17.52%, Viengphoukha is 19.24%, and \nHouixai is 17.35%). A least-cost solution has been selected for drainage outputs (Appendix 13). \n \n82.  Financial Benefits. Financial analysis of the three sample subprojects was conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects42 and Framework for the \nEconomic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects  (footnote  41).  A \nfinancial sustainability analysis helped to determine appropriate water tariffs, and to project the \nfinancial performance of PNPs during 2008\u20132015. It found that projected tariffs will need to be in \nline with WASA\u2019s recommendations on average tariffs for 2008\u20132010, adjusted at the assumed \nannual inflation rate of 5.1% from 2008 to 2010. The analysis showed that projected provincial \nutility-wide progressive tariffs meet the financial objectives. An affordability analysis revealed that \nthe percentage of monthly household income spent on water would be below 5% during this \nperiod for the average household and for households in the low-income group. The financial \nprojections indicate that PNPs are expected to earn positive net income and generate positive net \ncash flow each year during the forecast period. The PNPs will not require further subsidies and \nwill be able to fund all O&M expenses and to service their debt. The debt service coverage ratio is \nexpected to remain above 1.2 times in all years (Appendix 14). \n \n83.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. Efforts have been made to minimize and \navoid land acquisition and resettlement; however, some minimal impact is expected. Affected \npersons will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost at current market prices, \nand provided with transition allowances and rehabilitation measures. Additional support will be \nincluded for the poor, vulnerable, and households headed by women. In accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), a land acquisition and compensation framework for the \nProject and a short plan for each of the three sample subprojects have been prepared based on \nan  inventory  of  losses,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  discussions  with  affected  persons, \nprovincial and district authorities. The framework will assist in assessing and compensating \nimpacts  for  the  remaining  subprojects  where  detailed  design  will  be  undertaken  during \nimplementation. Each subproject town must be category B, or not significant to be eligible for \nfunding (see the summary land acquisition and compensation framework and plans in Appendix \n15 and Supplementary Appendix L).  \n \n84.  Environmental Impacts. The Project will address key environmental issues of access to \nsafe  water,  sanitation  and  drainage  issues  in  the  project  towns.  It  will  improve  the  overall \nenvironment in the project towns through the provision of piped water and improvements to \ndrainage  and  sanitation.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  conducted  for  the  three \nsample subprojects showed no significant adverse environmental impact. The initial dry season \nriver flow and water quality test results show sufficient (i) availability of water for the proposed water \nsupply schemes and downstream users, (ii) dilution effect for discharged backwash water, and (iii) \nwater quality that complies with drinking water quality standards. Potential increases in wastewater \nas a result of increased water supply will be mitigated by better drainage, public and household \ntoilets, and soakaways under outputs 3 and 4. For the remaining subprojects, the environmental \nassessment and review framework will guide the environmental assessment and management. \nThe Project is classified as category B (non-sensitive) in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), and each subproject will be required to follow the same classification to be eligible \n                                                 \n42  ADB. 2005.

The IEE for the Project, a summary IEE, three IEEs for sample subprojects, and the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n85.  Institutional and Governance Risks. Improved sector sustainability depends on effective \nsector  regulation,  corporatization  of  PNPs  to  operate  as  autonomous  business  entities,  and \nadequate human resources and institutional capacity at provincial and district levels. Potential \nrisks include (i) delayed sector regulation as a ministerial decision is required to establish the \nWSRC, appoint its members, and outline the regulatory functions and relationships between \nWSRC and WASA, (ii) resistance from provincial governors to PNP corporatization and to their \nautonomous status; (iii) failure to conduct annual tariff reviews and to make subsequent tariff \nadjustments; and (iv) lack of public support for annual tariff increases.  \n \n86.  To mitigate these risks (i) actions are included in the project to inform and generate \nsupport for sector regulation and corporatization among the key stakeholders; (ii) the existing \nMOA between the PNP board and Office of the Provincial Governor (OPG) will be expanded to \ninclude  a  number  of  regulatory  provisions;  (iii)  a  phased  approach  is  adopted  for  PNP \ncorporatization  with  four  PNPs  selected  initially;  (iv)  policy  reform  actions  for  PNP \ncorporatization are linked to disbursement  milestones such as tariff reviews and adjustments \nprior to subproject approval; (v) the subproject loan agreement between the PNP board and the \nGovernment with the OPG as witness, includes the tariff structure, a 3-year projected tariff level \nand a possible tariff adjustment mechanism; (vi) a human resources strategy and scholarships \nprogram will be developed; and (vii) awareness campaigns will be conducted in communities. \n87.  Technical  Risks.  The  lack  of  reliable  raw  water  assessments  could  result  in  the \nidentification  of  inappropriate  water  sources.  To  mitigate  this,  mechanisms  have  been \nincorporated in the project design to select good water sources and appropriate technology; \ncollect raw water measurements; and manage, operate, and maintain water supply systems. \nRaw water quantity and quality tests need to have been conducted in at least three wet and dry \nseasons before subproject implementation to qualify for inclusion in the Project.  \n88.  Project  Implementation  Risks.  These  include  front-end  and  other  delays  in \nimplementation caused by a delay in project approval; slow development of project planning, \nmanagement and administration capabilities; and the unclear fund flow procedures of parallel \nfinanciers. To mitigate these risks: (i) a financial management assessment of the EA was \ncompleted; (ii) the design of the Project closely follows that of the NCRWSSP and uses the \nsame PCU to coordinate the project; (iii) PIUs will have to submit training needs assessments at \nthe time of establishment; and (iv) periodic progress reviews against these training needs \nassessment will be conducted. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n89.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Water bill arrears. Each participating PNP will collect all water bill arrears in \naccordance with the plans to be agreed by the Government, ADB, and each \nparticipating PNP before funds disbursement for the relevant subproject. Each \nparticipating PNP will reduce and maintain accounts receivable to less than 90 \ndays. Where Government agency water bills are outstanding for 60 days or \n ", "  25\nmore, the Government will, within a further 30 days, allocate to the PNP special \nfunds from its budgetary resources to liquidate the outstanding accounts.  \n(ii)  Water supply and sanitation strategies and guidelines. The MPWT will (a) \napprove and implement an urban  water supply and sanitation sector strategy \nwithin  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness;  (b)  review  and  revise  as  necessary \nrelevant  policies  and  guidelines  to  further  clarify  and  strengthen  the  social, \neconomic, financial, and administrative targets for the urban water supply and \nsanitation sector within 30 months; and (c) approve and implement the revised \npolicies and guidelines, as revised and acceptable to ADB, within 36 months. \n(iii)  Water  quality  and  quantity  data  monitoring. MPWT will cause participating \nPNPs to monitor water quality and quantity data of the potential raw water sources \nfor  urban  water  supply,  and  will  ensure  that  the  least-cost  solution  for  each \nsubproject system is adopted, as determined from a comprehensive feasibility \nstudy that focuses on appropriate water treatment technology and service areas. \n(iv)  Latrine  grants  and  connection  fee.  The  Government  will  provide  poor \nhouseholds with a grant for sanitation improvements (the equivalent of $100 per \nhousehold). Relevant eligibility criteria will be determined in accordance with \nGovernment  procedures  and  satisfactory  to  ADB.  For  each  subproject,  the \nrelevant PNPs will waiver upfront fees for household connections in the core \nproject  villages  (domestic  consumers  only)  in  accordance  with  the  relevant \nscheme  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Households  that  receive  a \nconnection will be required to pay a monthly fee that covers water consumption, \nturnover tax, and basic administration.  \n(v)  Subproject loans. For each subproject, the Government will relend 30% of the \ncapital cost for the water supply system (as required by such subproject and \nacceptable to ADB) as a subproject loan to participating PNPs, which shall be duly \nsigned and executed prior to the contract award for the relevant subproject. Each \nsubproject loan will have an interest rate of 6.4% with a maturity period of 25 \nyears, including a 6-year grace period. The balance of 70% of the aforesaid cost \nwill be provided to the PNPs as a grant. \n(vi)  Tariffs. Each participating PNP shall adopt a provincial utility-wide progressive tariff \nstructure  with  three  consumption  blocks  prior  to  disbursement  of  funds  to  the \nrelevant subproject. The tariffs must be set at such levels to (a) recover full O&M \nand gradually increasing depreciation; and (b) maintain a debt service coverage \nratio of 1.2:1. Each PNP will undertake an annual tariff review, satisfactory to ADB \nand the Government, and will implement tariff adjustments by 1 April of each year. \n(vii)  Corporate plans. Each participating PNP shall prepare rolling 3-year corporate \nplans, acceptable to ADB and the Government, incorporating a specific action plan. \n(viii)  State companies under the Enterprise Law. Within 24 months commencing \nfrom the date that the EA and ADB agree to conduct a feasibility study for a \nsubproject town, the relevant PNP shall have brought its enterprise registration \ncertificate and its organization structure in line with the Enterprise Law.  \n(ix)  Scholarships program. Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the MPWT shall \ndevelop a human resource strategy and a scholarships program.

Lao PDR\u2019s urban population of 1.52 million (27% of the total population) lives in 145 officially \ndesignated urban centers in 139 districts, according to the 2005 census. The five largest towns include \nVientiane  Capital  and  the  four  secondary  towns  of  Kaysone  Phomvihan,  Pakse,  Thakhek,  and \nLouangphabang. About 42% of the urban population lives in 140 small towns with populations ranging \nfrom 2,000 to 20,000. After completing water supply systems in the large towns and provincial centers, \nthe Government is focused on developing systems in these small district towns to support economic \ndevelopment, geographical balance, and equity.  \n2.  Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage. Development of small towns is part of \nthe Government\u2019s national development agenda. The Lao PDR aims to exit least developed country \nstatus by 2020 through sustained, equitable economic growth, and social development. Small towns \nfunction as administrative and economic centers, and act as economic links between the rural areas and \nnational and international markets. They are the locations of markets, transport depots, and agricultural \nprocessing centers for their surrounding rural areas.  \n3.  Inadequate  water  and  poor  environmental  conditions  in  small  towns  deter  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and restrict the towns\u2019 capacity to act as urban centers for surrounding rural areas. Most \nsmall  town  communities  rely  on  shallow  wells,  ponds,  and  streams,  which  are  often  biologically \ncontaminated.  Some  towns  have  basic  piped  water  services  through  the  National  Center  of \nEnvironmental  Health  and  Water  Supply  or  small-scale  independent  providers  providing  water  to \ncommunal standpipes or individual house connections. Low coverage of safe piped water and poor \nsanitation conditions have resulted in high incidence of diarrheal diseases, intestinal worm infections, \ndengue, and malaria. The poor are particularly vulnerable to health shocks because of the high cost of \ntreating disease and lost work days for recovery (Appendix 11). \n4.  Government Sector Target. According to the Government\u2019s 1999 policy statement,1 the sector \ntarget is to provide 24-hour access to safe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by 2020. The \n2005 census reported that overall access to safe water supply in urban areas was about 67%, with 43% \nof urban households having piped water. However, these figures mask significant differences between \nthe five largest towns with combined 70% piped water supply coverage and the 140 small towns with \n21% coverage.2 About 76% of urban households have pour-flush toilets,3 with about 80% coverage in \nthe five largest towns and 69% in the small towns.4  The Government\u2019s focus on urban water supply and \nsanitation also contributes to efforts to achieve the Lao PDR Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nspecifically goal 7, target 7.10. To date, about 51 piped water supply systems have been constructed in \nsmall towns and 13 more have agreed financing. The remaining are smaller, mostly poorer towns that \nhave no formal piped water schemes with household connections. The Project will cover about 10% of \nthe required investment for the remaining towns that lack systems.  \n5.  Sector Policy, Decentralization, and Sector Institutions. The legal framework for the Lao \nwater and sanitation sector is contained in about 134 pieces of separate legislation for water supply and \n45 pieces of legislation for sanitation, various guidelines and policy documents. The draft water supply \nlaw aims to consolidate the water supply legislation and strengthen the legal basis for the provision of \nsanitation services. The Government also intends to clarify the regulatory environment for water supply; \nenable greater private sector participation and stronger community management of water supply; clarify \nresponsibilities and establish the right of access to basic water supply, sanitation and wastewater \nservices; and ensure that future supporting legislation reflects customary tribal and ethnic law through \n                                                 \n1  Prime Ministerial Decision No. 37 on Management and Development of Water Supply and Wastewater Sector, 30 September \n1999. \n2  2006 WASA indicators. \n3  2007 estimates based on 2005 census data. \n4  Based on 37 small towns surveyed for the NCRWSSP and STWSP. \n ", "Appendix 2  33\nextensive national field research. The urban water supply and sanitation sector road map, approved by \nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) in September 2008, reflects the current sector \nreforms and reconfirms the Government\u2019s long-term vision from 2008 to 2020. \n6.  The 1999 policy statement and the 2005  Enterprise  Law  provide the legal and  regulatory \nframework for the water supply utilities (PNPs). The 1999 policy statement established the institutional \nframework and policy for the urban water sector and (i) devolved responsibility for urban water supply \nand sanitation from the central to the provincial government; (ii) established the Water Supply Authority \n(WASA) and made provisions for a Water Supply Authority Board, under MPWT; and (iii) established \nPNPs  to  manage  the  urban  water  supply  services  in  each  province.  Nam  Papa  Lao,  which  had \npreviously been responsible for managing water supply systems throughout the country, was broken up \ninto Nam Papa Nakhonluang (Vientiane) and 16 PNPs. PNPs, as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), \nbecame responsible for (i) managing and operating all water supply and wastewater systems in urban \nand rural areas in their provinces; and (ii) ensuring sanitary facilities comply with sanitation regulations. \nHowever, in practice, PNPs are essentially water supply service providers that operate in designated \nurban centers. They are not involved in rural water supplies and have a very limited role in sanitation.  \n7.  The 1999 policy statement also made PNPs responsible for setting tariffs to generate sufficient \nrevenue to recover recurrent costs and a proportion of depreciation or debt servicing. In practice, the \nPNPs  seek  provincial  governors\u2019  approval  for  tariff  adjustments,  and  submit  annual  budgets  and \nrequests for tariff adjustment to their boards. Each PNP is governed by an administrative board (or PNP \nboard), reporting to the provincial governor. The policy statement also requires the PNPs to operate on \ncommercial principles in accordance with 3-year rolling corporate plans. In practice, they operate under \nDPWT\u2019s supervision, receive government budgetary allocations following the Budget Law, and do not \nhave corporate plans. With little experience in business or financial management, a PNP is similar to a \nline department of the provincial administration. Although PNPs set their own salary levels, these are \nsubmitted to the board for approval. PNP staff remuneration remains too low to attract and retain skilled \nstaff, especially in remote areas. \n8.  The Enterprise Law is the primary law governing domestic, foreign and state-owned enterprises. \nBy May 2009, SOEs, including PNPs, will be required to amend their existing enterprise registration \ndocuments  to  become  state  companies\u2014a  special  form  of  limited  liability  company.  As  state \ncompanies, PNPs will need to maintain their registration certificates in line with the Government\u2019s \ntimeframe and conditions. PNPs will be required to submit a contract of incorporation, establish a board \nof directors, prepare by-laws, and hold statutory meetings. Corporatized PNPs will have a greater \nbusiness focus and independence from state administration and will be able to provide incentives to \nstaff via a more flexible remuneration system based on profit earned. The current SOE reform program \nwill help the PNP corporatization process, as Nam Papa Nakhonluang is one of the largest SOEs \nselected in phase 1. The program aims to enhance the SOEs\u2019 transparency and efficiency, make them \ncommercially viable, and reduce the burden they impose on the government budget.  \n9.  The 1999 policy statement and a 2005 prime ministerial decree5 provide the legal basis for \nWASA to perform as the sector regulator and make the Department of Housing and Urban Planning \n(DHUP) of the MPWT responsible for urban water sector strategies and plans, technical standards, and \nthe long-term capital investment program. They delegate these responsibilities to the WSD of the \nDHUP, which is responsible for developing sector policies, strategies and investment plans; mobilizing \nfunding; developing and supervising investment projects; preparing and implementing standards and \nguidelines; and developing human resources of water sector institutions.6 \n10.  Since  1999,  WASA  has  prepared  key  financial,  management,  technical  and  regulatory \nguidelines, facilitated private sector water supply initiatives, carried out tariff reviews in 2004 and 2007, \n                                                 \n5 Prime Ministerial Decree No. 191/PM/2005. \n6 DHUP Decision 8027/2005. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nand published annual performance reports on PNPs. The 2005 prime ministerial decree confirmed \nWASA\u2019s role in: (i) issuing licenses to suppliers; (ii) ensuring they operate according to their licenses \nand in accordance with legislation and regulations; (iii) protecting standards of service; (iv) encouraging \nsuppliers to become more efficient; and (v) stimulating competition where appropriate. It also sets out \nthe  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Water  Supply  Regulatory  Committee  (WSRC),  the  regulatory \nobligations of urban water supply service providers, and the rights of consumers. If WSRC and WASA \ncontinue to be situated within DHUP of the MPWT, it will limit their effectiveness as a sector regulator.  \n11.  During project preparation, efforts focused on (i) formally recognizing the roles of WSRC and \nWASA, (ii) eliminating any conflict of interest in the regulatory system, (ii) clarifying the responsibilities of \nWASA and DHUP, and (iii) streamlining WSRC and WASA\u2019s institutional standing in the MPWT. The \nProject supports moving WSRC and WASA outside DHUP, as a first step toward an effective regulatory \nsystem. WSRC will consist of government officials, members from industry and consumers. With other \npartners, the Project will strengthen the capacity of the WSRC, as the SOE reform program and the \nEnterprise Law will increase the need for independent regulation. The early experiences of establishing \nthe WSRC and WASA will be an example for regulation in other sectors (the roles and responsibilities of \nWSRC, WASA and the WSD are described in Supplementary Appendix A).  \n12.  Sector Funding and Investment. Capital investments in the urban water supply sector are \nfunded primarily through external assistance, with Government allocations averaging about $9.9 million \nannually from 2001 to 2004. A sector investment plan, attached to the 1999 policy statement listed all \nurban center water supply systems in order of priority for rehabilitation, expansion, or development. The \n1999 plan was updated in 2004 to reflect Government\u2019s growing emphasis on equitable development by \nimproving the small towns, particularly in the poorest districts. Investment needs for 2005\u20132020 were \nestimated at $267 million, including $103 million for small towns. The 2004 plan provides an incremental \napproach to water supply in the Lao PDR, as investments are prioritized according to population; \npoverty  status;  location  relative  to  a  major  road,  growth  corridor,  or  international  border;  tourism \npotential; and the provincial government\u2019s development priorities. The WSD regularly updates the list of \npriority investments (Table A2).  \n13.  The Ministry of Finance will relend 30% of capital costs of water supply systems to the PNPs. \nFrom 2002 to 2006, the PNPs\u2019 financial statements show that they generated total operating revenues \nof $19.1 million from water tariffs and $8.3 million from other user charges. However, these revenues \nhave been insufficient to carry out adequate levels of O&M. The combined losses incurred by PNPs in \n2006 were more than $3 million, greater than the government\u2019s health budget over the same period.7 All \nPNPs lost money and relied on government financial support or simply allow their assets to deteriorate. \n13.  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  encourage  greater  private \nparticipation in urban infrastructure and services by raising utility tariffs to cost recovery levels, reducing \nbudget subsidies, improving business performance, and increasing private participation and investment. \nHowever, there are few public\u2013private partnerships in the Lao water supply sector largely because of \nweak  enabling  conditions  such  as  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  WASA  has  promoted \npartnerships in urban water supply with support from various development partners, including GRET \nand the French water utility, SEDIF. This resulted in two official private water supply concessions by \n2006 in Feuang district town and in four villages of Vang Vieng district (Vientiane province). The \nEnterprise Law is an important step in improving the business and investment climate. \n14.  During  project  preparation,  it  was  estimated  that  informal  small  providers  or  cooperatives \noperate piped water systems with individual house connections in 30% of small urban centers. They \nsupply water to about 5,200 households (or 2% of all urban households). These informal systems \nusually supply untreated water to villages at low pressure. Most small towns offer opportunities for small \nindependent providers to participate in piped water supply systems in areas that are not serviced by the \n                                                 \n7 WASA. 2007.

Twenty-one small towns are ranked first or secondary priority towns and are therefore \neligible under the Project (Table A2). The subprojects will be selected from these 21 unless \notherwise agreed by ADB and the Government. An estimated 15 towns (new systems in 12 \ntowns and rehabilitated systems in 3 towns) are expected to receive financing under the Project. \nThe final number of towns will depend on their compliance with the subproject selection criteria \nand procedures agreed by the Government and ADB. \n3.  The order in which subprojects are implemented will be determined by the Government in \nconsultation with ADB, and will depend on (i) the readiness of the concerned provincial and \ndistrict governments and PNPs to implement the subprojects; (ii) compliance with the agreed \neligibility criteria, including confirmation that the impacts on resettlement and the environment are \ninsignificant; and (iii) geographical grouping of the subprojects to minimize costs and maximize \nimplementation efficiency.  \n4.  Subprojects will be implemented as they become ready. For reasons of cost, efficiency and \nexpediency, they will be prepared and implemented in groups of three or four. Subprojects will be \nscreened by the PCU for their readiness according to the criteria. If a particular province and its \nPNP are not considered ready to implement the Project, the subproject will be assigned a lower \npriority, and the province and PNP will be asked to undertake actions to improve its readiness for \nimplementation.

The proposed Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project will assist all \nparticipating water supply utilities (PNPs) to become efficient, autonomous, commercially focused \nbusiness  enterprises  operating  under  the  Enterprise  Law.  The  Project  will  assist  the \ncorporatization process by providing institutional and personnel strengthening over 3 years, in \naccordance with the following corporatization program (or as amended from time to time in \nconsultation with ADB). The first year of the program will be conducted for a group of about four \nPNPs (selected under the previous Northern and Central Regions Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project [NCRWSSP]) before the start of the proposed Project.1 These include Oudomxai, \nLouangphabang, Louang-Namtha, and Xaignabouli PNPs. The Project will continue to support \nthese four PNPs during years 2 and 3 of the program, and the program will be rolled out to other \nPNPs as they begin to participate in the Project.  \n \n2.  The corporatization program is divided into the following phases. \n(i)  Phase  1  (1\u20138  months): (a) initial awareness and support for corporatization, \n(b) organization restructuring and basic capacity development, and (c) preparation \nof corporate plans. \n(ii)  Phase 2 (9\u201324 months): (a) implementation of corporate plans, including a team \nbuilding exercise at the regional and PNP levels to exchange corporate planning \nexperiences; (b) revision and updating of existing corporate plans; and (c) capacity \ndevelopment.  \n(iii)  Phase 3 (25\u201336 months): (a) implementation of corporate plans, and (b) revision \nand updating of existing corporate plans (c) capacity development, and (d) phase \nout support.  \n \n3.  After the first four PNPs have completed the 3-year program, an evaluation will be completed. \nWorkshops at the provincial level and team-building exercises for PNPs internally and with other \nPNPs have been incorporated into the program to ensure feedback to stakeholders. Support to \nPNPs for corporate planning will phased as follows (details are in Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nTable A5: Summary of Corporatization Program for PNPs Over 3 Years \n \nStep  Activity  Timing  Output \nPhase 1 (1\u20148 months): Initial Awareness, Basic Capacity Development, and Corporate Plan Preparation \n1  Provincial governor agrees to PNP  Year  1,  Provincial governor\u2019s letter agreeing to PNP \ncorporatization.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Lao National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) outlines the government\u2019s commitment to improving \nwater and sanitation services as a key means of reducing poverty. It focuses on increasing the distribution of treated water to \nthe population in urban and suburban areas, including improving access to water and latrines in schools and households. The \nNGPES has been integrated in the Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006\u20132010, which aims for  \neconomic growth of 7.5%\u20138.0% per year; $700\u2013$750 gross domestic product per capita; about 652,000 new productive jobs; \nand a reduction in the number of poor households to 15%. The plan prioritizes development of basic infrastructure and \nservices in urban areas to accelerate broad-based economic growth. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Lao PDR \n(2006\u20132011) is closely aligned with the SEDP. It is a results-based strategy that focuses on achieving sustainable economic \ngrowth, accelerating progress toward the non-income Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), building capacity for good \ngovernance, promoting regional cooperation and integration as an engine of progress, and fostering national development \nthrough the country\u2019s own strategy and plans. ADB is committed to supporting initiatives to improve the delivery and \nmanagement of water supply and sanitation services in a financially sustainable manner in urban areas, primarily in \nsecondary and small towns. The Project is in line with the Government and ADB strategies. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI-MDG \nKey Issues. Lao PDR has a per capita gross domestic product of $490, and about one-third of its population is poor. \nStructural factors constraining growth and poverty reduction include small domestic markets, the subsistence nature of the \nrural economy, skill shortages, and the remoteness and isolation of much of the population. However, the economy has grown \nand diversified in the last 5 years, based on the country\u2019s natural resource base for hydropower, mining, and tourism, and \npoverty incidence dropped from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003 (ADB CSP). In the project towns, 13.3% of the households are \npoor, and several towns have higher poverty levels than the national average of 32%, including Viengphoukha (60%) and \nPakbeng (42%). Of the 21 small towns short-listed, 7 are in the poor and poorest districts, all 21 are situated within the key \ntransport and economic corridors, 10 are key tourism destinations, and 9 are near international borders. About 75% of the poor \nhouseholds are from ethnic groups  living on marginally productive  land. Remoteness and variation in access  to basic \ninfrastructure are key determinants of the regional and unequal distribution of poverty. In the expected project areas, the majority \nLao-Tai ethnic group has much better access to safe water (58%) than other ethnic groups (25%\u201333%). About 75% of non-Lao-\nTai ethnic groups lack access to sanitation facilities. Nearly all households in the project towns including those with access to \nwater supply utilities (PNPs), Nam Sa\u2019at, or private systems rely on well, river and/or streams as a source of water in the dry \nseason and consequently experience seasonal water shortages and poor water quality, leading to serious health problems. \nDesign Features. The Project is expected to benefit an estimated 137,000 residents in 124 project villages in 15 subproject \ntowns. The Project will have a direct impact on the health and living conditions of the town communities. Residents of the small \ntowns will benefit from improved health and savings in health care expenditure, and will ultimately receive income benefits from \nexpanded access to piped water and sanitation services. The drainage and sanitation outputs will reduce the incidence and \nseverity of flooding and polluted water, provide sanitation facilities in public areas and schools, and improve living conditions and \npublic health in the project area. Water supply and sanitation will particularly benefit women, by reducing the time and money \nthey spend on purchasing, collecting, treating and storing water and by improving the hygiene and health of families and \ncommunities and reducing health care expenditure. The projected water supply tariffs are affordable and below the affordability \nthreshold of 5% of household expenditures. The Project will adopt several mechanisms to ensure water continues to be \naffordable for the poor: (i) no upfront connection charges for households connecting to the PNP system; (ii) progressive tariffs, \nbased on a lifeline water consumption; (iii) financial assistance for poor households to construct a hygienic latrine; and (v) flexible \ncontributions of cash, materials and labor for small-scale demand-responsive village environmental improvements. A greater role \nfor the poor, women and members of small ethnic groups in local planning, consultation and decision-making is achieved through \nrepresentation on village committees. \nII.   SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis. Lao PDR lags behind other countries in the region on a number of non-income MDGs, such as life \nexpectancy at birth (63 years), child malnutrition (40%), and infant mortality rate (62 per 1,000 live births). One third of the adult \npopulation cannot read or write. Lao PDR is also lagging behind on the MDG water and sanitation targets. The impacts of the \nlack of water and sanitation services are significant, and water-related diseases are significant contributors to poor health status, \nlost work and school time, high expenditure on medicines and health care costs, increased workload for women as carers, and \nincreased poverty. National health statistics suggest that water and sanitation-related illnesses such as malaria, dengue, \ndiarrhea, and intestinal helminths are prevalent in the subproject towns. Diarrhea continues to be the second biggest killer of \nchildren and the third biggest killer of adults in the country. Malaria is the number one ranked cause of mortality overall, with 70% \nof the population at risk. High calcium content in the water also results in problems with kidney and urinary tract stones for 12%\u2013\n18% of adults and children. \n ", "Appendix 10  53\nB.  Consultation and Participation \nConsultation and Participation Process During the Project Preparation. The Project was designed following a highly \nparticipatory approach and involved consultations with officials, residents and key informants in subproject towns and at the \nnational and provincial levels. Activities included (i) reconnaissance visits to consult and inform officials about the Project, \ninformal interviews with villagers, and district data collection; (ii) engineering and environmental visits in three sample \nsubproject  towns;  (iii)  sample  social  surveys  in  the  three  sample  subproject  towns;  (iv)  presentation  of  preliminary \nassessments to district and village officials in the three sample subproject towns; (v) meetings with representatives of Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union, the Ministry of Health, development partners and organizations in the water and sanitation sector; and (vi) \nworkshops with national and provincial stakeholders on policy issues.  \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?    \nInformation sharing          Consultation        Collaborative decision making       Empowerment.  \nWas a C&P plan prepared?    Yes. During implementation, detailed participation plans will be prepared for each subproject \nusing participatory methods and incorporated into individual feasibility studies. The Project includes a community action and \nparticipation program, which will require community-driven planning and implementation of awareness programs and small-\nscale environmental improvements. \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues. Women, particularly from small ethnic groups, are key beneficiaries of the Project. Lack of water supply and \nsanitation directly affects their daily life, health and workload. They are primarily responsible for taking care of daily household \nneeds and family health, and spend up to 2 hours per day collecting and storing water. Women in Lao PDR are more \nvulnerable than men because they lack access to land, food, education, and health care, and have long working hours. While \ngender roles vary within rural communities, women from some ethnic groups tend to be the most disadvantaged. Compared \nwith men, women have far lower average literacy and education enrollment and completion rates. Education gaps widen at \nhigher levels of schooling. They have limited access to market information, technical training, and financial services. Promoting \ngender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR. The National Commission for the Advancement of Women \nhelps to ensure women have equal access to basic services and productive resources, and is responsible for implementing \nnational strategies. It reports directly to the government. The LWU helps with implementation on the ground.  \nKey Actions. The project design includes an output on enhanced gender equity in urban water supply and sanitation, \nfinanced by the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund. It also includes a detailed gender action plan with specific \ntargets and measurable indicators.

Water is fundamental to life, and the connection between simple improvements in water \nsupply, sanitation and health is well demonstrated. Improved access to water leads to better \nhygiene since people wash their hands, bodies, and clothes more frequently. Women, who are \nlargely responsible for water collection, have more time to attend to their children\u2019s needs and this \nbenefits  their  children\u2019s  health. 1  This  appendix  outlines  the  relationship  and  modes  of \ntransmission of disease, and the conceptual framework of the relationship and the interventions \nrequired to achieve improvements in the health of the target population under the proposed \nProject.2 It explains the way in which diseases spread through poor sanitation and hygiene \nwithin a community and the roles played by education levels, economic status, social class, \ngender, and cultural traditions.  \n2.  Experience  has  shown  that  breaking  the  \u201ctransmission  cycle\u201d  and  achieving \nimprovements in health outcomes is a result of changes in social and hygiene practices. In \ndoing so, there is a \u201cbehavioral lag\u201d between improvements in water supply and in health. In \ngeneral, most water supply projects are concerned with addressing several of these factors, \nmost typically the relations between improved water supply, sanitation, education and gender \nissues (i.e., timesaving for women and children caused by decreased time spent on water \ncollection and storage). When water is taken as a component within a broader development \ncontext, the correlations are positive between increased access to water supply and improved \nhealth, irrespective of water quality and the social factors. The links between improvements in \nwater supply and improvements in health become more apparent when they are linked to \neducation and gender issues surrounding primary health care. \n3.  Transmission of water-related infections is divided into four categories: (i) fecal\u2013oral \n(waterborne and water-washed); (ii) water-washed (skin and eye infections); (iii) water-based \n(skin penetrating or ingested); and (iv) water-related insect vector (biting near water, breeding in \nwater). The key to understanding this relationship is to distinguish between water-washed and \nwaterborne  diseases.  The  eradication  of  water-washed  diseases  is  dependent  solely  on \nimprovements in water quantity, and can be divided into two categories: (i) intestinal diseases \n(e.g., cholera and bacillary dysentery), and (ii) skin and eye diseases.  \n4.  More frequent washing and bathing, and improvements in sanitation are dependent \nupon increased water quantity. These behavioral changes and infrastructure improvements can \nreduce the possibility of fecal\u2013oral diseases. Skin and eye infections include bacterial skin \nsepsis, scabies, and fungal infections as well as trachomas. Like the intestinal diseases, they \nare caused by poor hygiene. By increasing the volume of water used for personal hygiene, it is \nanticipated that the incidence of these infections can be reduced. In addition, increasing the \nquantity of water available may reduce the proliferation of pathogens in contaminated food. The \nassumption is that more water results in more frequent preparation of food, thereby reducing the \nopportunity for pathogens to multiply and to cause disease. It has also been well illustrated that \nthe effects of improved water quantity are most profound on poorer areas as piped water can \nreduce the exposure to pathogens to a greater extent.  \n5.  Piped water supply reduces the need for women to collect and store water. This has \nenabled women to focus on food preparation, participate in income-generating activities, and \nconserve physical energy. The benefits of reduced physical drudgery and better diets has had \n \n                                                 \n1  AusAID. 2002. Water and Primary Health Care for Tibetan Villages. Canberra: AusAID: 39.  \n2  A menu of interventions to be used during project implementation is included in Supplementary Appendix P. \n ", "Appendix 11  55\nbeen seen on the health of children, especially during pregnancy and lactation.3 Improved piped \nwater supply and sanitation can have a dramatic positive impact on health and learning among \nschoolchildren, especially girls. Girls who are unable to access clean, safe and separate toilets \nand hand washing facilities, may drop out of school at puberty, or even earlier. \n6.  Sanitation conditions and incidence of disease in the three sample subproject towns \nvary. District authorities for health and education, as well as the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU), are \nactive in the towns providing information about health and sanitation through schools and to the \npublic. The majority of households referred to the district authorities as the primary source of \nsuch information, including at other health clinics and on the radio. \n7.  In Houixai, diarrhea affected about 9% of adults and nearly 20% of children in 2006. \nHigh calcium content in the water in Houixai results in kidney and urinary tract stones, which \naffects 12%\u201318% of adults and children; the treatment for these conditions often requires \nsurgery. According to informants, mild cases can be handled at the local district hospital but \nmore severe cases require travel to the provincial hospital. Malaria is the major water-related \nillness in Viengphoukha district, with 136 cases in 2006. Other water-related diseases include \ndiarrhea, skin diseases, and dysentery. In Songkhone, the rate of water-related diseases is \nrelatively  low.  In  2006,  there  were  5  cases  of  malaria,  33  cases  of  diarrhea,  8  cases  of \ndysentery, and 12 cases of dengue fever. Officially reported cases are usually much lower than \nactual incidence of disease, especially in the case of diarrhea, which is often home-treated and \nnever recorded in government health statistics.   \n8.  Health  status  directly  links  with  poverty  and  household  expenditure  on  wealth. \nViengphoukha, which has lower income levels than other towns, has a higher incidence of \ndisease, and households spend proportionately more of their smaller incomes on health care\u2014a \nfactor contributing to poverty. Households in Huoixai and Songkhone allocate about the same \nproportion of their yearly expenditures for medical expenses\u2014a median amount of 11.3%. In \nViengphoukha, households allocate nearly 30% of their yearly expenses to medical costs. \nThese significantly higher costs may be attributable to one or more factors, including high \nincidence of malaria, and travel costs to medical services in the provincial town.  \n9.  In Viengphoukha, improved health is perceived as a major benefit for everyone in the \nproject villages regardless of age or sex. However, the majority of residents surveyed wash \ntheir hands sometimes before eating or after using the toilet. Water and soap are rarely kept \nnear the toilet. Increased availability of water should make it easier for people to wash their \nhands regularly; however, hygiene promotion is also needed to promote behavior change. \n10.  Conclusion. The essential link between improved water supply and better health needs \nto be seen within a broader context, whereby the improvements in access to water supply \n(quantity) lead to reduced exposure to pathogens. Time savings can have a dramatic effect on \nwomen\u2019s  health  and  ability  to  care  for  children.  This  has  translated  into  better  nutritional \nstandards and lower rates of child morbidity and mortality. The effects of improved water supply \nare felt most by lower socioeconomic groups. Groups with more education and better sanitation \npractices may benefit more from improvements to water quality. For low-income groups, better \nwater quantity enables them to address more basic questions of sanitation and child welfare \nand therefore has the greatest effect.  \n                                                 \n3  Pinstrup-Anderson, P., D.

Economic analyses for the water supply and the drainage and sanitation components of \nthe three sample subprojects were undertaken in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects, \nand Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.1  \n2.  The incremental capital costs and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for each \nwater supply and drainage and sanitation component were estimated and are expressed in \nconstant August 2007 prices in Lao kip. All costs were derived from the financial project costs \nand re-expressed in economic prices using the domestic price numeraire. Taxes and duties \nwere  deducted  as  appropriate  from  base  costs.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.05 while non-traded components \nwere valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.71 for unskilled labor \nwas applied to reflect its opportunity cost in the context of the wide availability of labor in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Subproject components are assumed to have a \nuseful economic life of 25 years; the mechanical and electrical equipment of the components \nare assumed to have a useful economic life of 10 years. \n3.  Demand Forecast. Water demand in the sample subproject towns was derived from the \ncurrent  population  within  the  planned  service  area,  population  growth,  current  and  future \ndomestic  water  consumption  levels,  and  a  provision  for  nondomestic  water  consumption. \nReliable data on the amount of water presently consumed by households without piped-water \nconnections in the subproject town is not available. Households typically use a variety of water \nsources  and  do  not  measure  or  assess  their  consumption.  However,  based  on  the \nsocioeconomic household survey result as well as observations of water use behavior in the \nsubproject town during the field visits, it is estimated that average daily demand from existing \nsources of non-piped water ranges from 30 to 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd) depending on \nthe effort and resources needed to acquire the water, and on income levels. The internationally \naccepted lifeline consumption requirement is 40 lpcd. \n4.  Per  capita  water  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  after  the  construction  or \nrehabilitation of the piped water supply system, primarily because of (i) the reduced cost of \nacquiring water, (ii) better water quality, and (iii) greater convenience and reliability of the piped \nwater supply system. Demand is also a function of changes in price and household income and \nestimated price and income elasticity were incorporated in the demand forecasts. \n5.  Least-Cost Analysis. Least-cost analysis was undertaken to evaluate different technical \noptions, including alternative water sources, the size and timing of water treatment plants, \nreservoirs, and transmission mains. The analysis compares the net present value of incremental \ncapital and O&M cost streams of viable technical alternatives, which are discounted at an \neconomic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 12%. The alternative with the lowest net present \nvalue is recommended for engineering design and benefit\u2013cost analysis. \n6.  Economic Benefits. The principal benefits that would be derived from the development or \nrehabilitation of a system of piped, treated water include improved accessibility, convenience and \nreliability of water supply, as well as increased quantities of water and improved water quality. \nHealth benefits will result from the provision of safe water and improved household sanitation, \nwhich will reduce the incidence of diarrhea, dysentery, and other waterborne illness. \n7.  Quantifiable economic benefits of improved water supply services include (i) benefits \nfrom non-incremental water consumption, valued at the weighted average supply price of water \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 13    59\nfrom non-piped sources; (ii) incremental water consumption, valued at average demand price; \nand (iii) other resource savings. Currently, the residents in the subproject towns use a variety of \nwater sources, including rivers, wells, rain water, bottled water, and private vendors. Costs \nassociated with the existing water supply include source and treatment costs, collecting costs, \nand storage costs. The cost savings resulting from the Project are the costs avoided by the \nwater users because they will receive water from the project water supply system. They are \nmeasured by multiplying the existing water consumption by the weighed average water supply \ncosts of various existing non-piped water sources in the subproject town. Benefits associated \nwith incremental water consumption (the difference between with and without project per capita \nconsumption) were measured at the average demand price for the project water (the average of \nthe weighted average supply price from existing non-piped water sources and the average \ntariff).2 Health benefits are likely to occur, provided that the adverse health impacts of an \nincreased volume of wastewater can be minimized. However, they have not been quantified and \nincluded in the analysis because of a lack of reliable data. \n8.  The  drainage  and  sanitation  components  will  significantly  reduce  the  incidence  and \nseverity of flooding, reduce ponding of polluted water in public areas, provide sanitation facilities in \npublic areas and schools, and improve the environmental and living conditions and public health \nin  the  subproject  areas.  However,  these  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify.  Using  land  value \nincreases to reflect environment improvements is not appropriate since the land market in the Lao \nPDR is distorted. Avoided flood damages could not be used to quantify the benefits as there are \nno data available. The proposed subprojects are economically justified on the basis that they \nadhere to agreed planning and design criteria and are cost-effective solutions to the problem of \nproviding a basic level of service adapted to the local needs. \n9.  Results of Economic Analysis. The results of the economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) calculation and sensitivity analysis of the sample subprojects, as shown in Table A13, \nare well above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. It can be concluded that the \nproposed subprojects are economically viable under the base case scenario and also under \nvarious adverse changes in conditions. The adverse changes analyzed were (i) a capital cost \noverrun of 10%; (ii) an increase in the O&M cost by 10%; (iii) a reduction in benefits by 10%; \nand  (iv) subproject  benefits  delayed  by  1  year.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the \nproposed subprojects are most sensitive to delay in subproject benefits, but the EIRR remains \nwell above the economic opportunity cost of capital. \nTable A13: EIRR and Sensitivity Analyses \nKey Variable    Songkhone    Viengphoukha    Houixai \nWater Supply  Change  EIRR  SI  SV  EIRR  SI  SV  EIRR  SI  SV \nBase Case    17.52%      19.24%      17.35%     \nCapital Cost  +10%  15.98%  2.80  36%  17.72%  2.11  47%  15.58%  3.32  30% \nO&M Cost  +10%  17.23%  0.53  190%  18.74%  0.69  145%  17.21%  0.26  382% \nBenefits  \u201310%  15.52%  3.63  28%  17.05%  3.03  33%  15.25%  3.93  25% \nSubproject Delay  1 Year  14.78%      16.05%      14.58%     \nEIR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance,  SI = sensitivity indicator (ratio of % \nchange in EIRR above the cut-off rate of 12% to % change in a variable), SV = switching value (% change in a \nvariable to reduce the EIRR to the cut-off rate of 12%). \nSource: ADB estimates. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999.

A financial analysis was conducted for the water supply component of the subproject to \ndetermine appropriate water tariffs and forecast the financial performance of the water supply \nutility  (PNP).  Financial  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects and Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal \nof Urban Development Sector Projects.1 A financial management assessment of the Executing \nAgency (EA) was also completed. The analysis has two parts: (i) determination of appropriate \nwater tariffs, and (ii) projection of financial performance of the PNP. \nA.  Bases for Financial Projections \n2.  Price.  The  financial  projections  are  presented  in  Lao kip  on  a  current  price  basis. \nRevenues and costs are converted from a constant 2007 price basis to current prices using \nprojected local inflation rates, which are 5.1% per year between 2008 and 2010 and 5.2% per \nyear thereafter. The foreign inflation rate is assumed at 1.2% per year over the projection \nperiod. The domestic and foreign proportions of capital cost are escalated at the assumed \ninflation rates over the construction period, and for future plant replacement. All operating costs \nare  increased  year-on-year  by  the  domestic  inflation  rate.  An  average  exchange  rate  of \nKN9,600=$1 is used when converting foreign exchange costs to local currency equivalent. Price \ncontingencies, inflation and interest during construction (as a result of any debt financing) are \nexcluded in the calculation of the financial internal rate of return. \n3.  Financial Objectives. Each PNP participating in the project will implement utility-wide \ntariffs that are sufficient to (i) recover utility-wide operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, \nincluding subproject O&M costs; (ii) recover utility-wide debt service, including subproject debt \nservice; (iii) maintain a utility-wide debt service ratio of at least 1.2 once the subproject is fully \noperational; (iv) gradually recover an increasing proportion of annual depreciation expense of \nthe utility-wide fixed assets, including subproject fixed assets; and (v) maintain its accounts \nreceivable at less than 90 days of annual sales. \n4.  Connection Policy. To encourage customers to connect to the PNP piped system and \nto support the poor, the Project will (i) install service connections and meters at no up-front cost \nfor  all  households  in  the  service  area  that  apply  for  connection  (connection  costs  will  be \nrecovered through water tariffs); (ii) after the designated construction period, continue to provide \nconnections  at  no  up-front  cost  to  domestic  consumers;  and  (iii)  charge  businesses  and \ninstitutions for connections based on the full cost of materials and labor during the designated \nconstruction period and afterwards. \n5.  Operating Revenues. Operating revenues were derived from water sales, meter rental \ncharges, connection fees, and miscellaneous income. Future water sales were calculated on the \nbasis of water demand and projected utility-wide water tariff levels. Meter rental income was \nestimated for all customers, expressed in 2007 prices, and then adjusted each year by the local \ninflation  rate.  Connection  fees  were  set  at  the  estimated  average  cost  of  connection  of \nKN700,000 and then adjusted each year by the local inflation rate. Miscellaneous revenue \nderived primarily from late payment penalties was estimated at 2% of water sales revenues. \n6.  Operating Expenses. Annual O&M costs by major expense item (personnel, electricity, \nchemicals, maintenance, administration, new connection costs) for the subproject were based on \nestimates based on the operating characteristics of the system. Annual O&M costs for the PNP\u2019s \nother systems were estimated separately, based on current levels and consolidated with the \nsubproject\u2019s  costs  to  present  the  utility-wide  O&M  costs.  Turnover  tax  was  excluded  in  the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 2004.

Bad debt was provided at \n2% of outstanding accounts. Depreciation expense was calculated on an average asset life of 25 \nyears on a straight-line basis. Income tax was applied at 35% on pre-tax income. \n7.  Subproject  Cost  and  Financing  Plan.  The  subproject  capital  cost  is  based  on  an \nestimate, inclusive of engineering base costs, physical and price contingencies, and interest during \nconstruction. The interest is capitalized and amortized over the life of the subproject. The financial \nanalysis assumes that subproject financing is provided by way of grant and loan financing. A \nportion of the proceeds of the proposed grant from ADB, as well as the government contribution, \nwill be provided to finance the subproject capital cost. Thirty percent of the subproject capital cost \nwill be lent to the PNP through a subproject loan while the balance will be provided as a grant. The \nsubproject loan will be made in local currency and will carry an interest rate of 6.4% per annum, \nwith repayment over 25 years, including a 6-year grace period.  \nB.  Provincial Utility-Wide Progressive Tariff \n8.  Tariff Requirements and Structure. To meet the agreed upon financial objectives of \nthe sector, projected utility-wide tariffs shall be in line with Water Supply Authority (WASA) \nrecommendations on average tariffs for 2008\u20132010, adjusted at the assumed inflation rate of \n5.1% per year between 2008 and 2010. Starting in 2011, the tariffs will have to be increased at \n7% annually to keep up with inflation. The projected utility-wide tariffs are in Table A14.1.  \nTable A14.1: Projected Utility-Wide Tariffs (KN) \nItem  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nLouang-Namtha (Viengphoukha)                 \nDomestic                 \n     First 10 m3  1,258  1,574  1,886  2,018  2,159  2,310  2,472  2,645 \n     >10 to 20 m3  2,200  2,753  3,298  3,529  3,776  4,040  4,323  4,626 \n     > 20 m3  3,200  3,994  4,860  5,200  5,564  5,954  6,371  6,817 \n     Average  1,850  2,312  2,817  3,014  3,225  3,451  3,692  3,951 \nNon-domestic  3,200  3,994  4,860  5,200  5,564  5,954  6,371  6,817 \nOverall Average  2,100  2,628  3,148  3,817  4,084  4,370  4,676  5,003 \nTariff Increase (%)  128  25  20  7  7  7  7  7 \nBokeo (Houixai)                 \nDomestic                 \n     First 10 m3  1,238  1,431  1,664  1,781  1,905  2,039  2,181  2,334 \n     >10 to 20 m3  3,000  3,468  4,032  4,314  4,616  4,939  5,285  5,655 \n     > 20 m3  4,150  4,782  5,523  5,910  6,323  6,766  7,240  7,746 \n     Average  2,750  3,206  3,700  3,959  4,237  4,533  4,850  5,190 \nNon-domestic  4,150  4,782  5,523  5,910  6,323  6,766  7,240  7,746 \nOverall Average  3,000  3,468  4,032  4,559  4,859  5,199  5,563  5,953 \nTariff Increase (%)  119  16  16  7  7  7  7  7 \nSavanakhet (Songkhone)                 \nDomestic                 \n     First 10 m3  1,100  1,156  1,215  1,300  1,391  1,489  1,593  1,704 \n     >10 to 20 m3  2,200  2,312  2,430  2,600  2,782  2,977  3,185  3,408 \n     > 20 m3  3,300  3,468  3,645  3,900  4,173  4,466  4,778  5,113 \n     Average  1,750  1,997  2,320  2,482  2,656  2,842  3,041  3,253 \nNon-domestic  5,200  5,991  6,904  7,387  7,904  8,457  9,049  9,683 \nOverall Average  2,200  2,522  2,927  3,132  3,351  3,586  3,837  4,106 \nTariff Increase (%)  65  15  16  7  7  7  7  7 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \n9.  The application of a utility-wide tariff by the PNP is consistent with Policy Statement 3 of \nthe Water Supply Tariff Policy of the Lao PDR.2 The domestic tariff has been modified to a rising \nthree-block structure to ensure that water can be afforded by the poor while maintaining the same \naverage for the domestic tariff. New water supply schemes have been found to be disadvantaged \ncompared to existing systems because (i) new schemes cover smaller populations and lack \neconomies of scale; (ii) they are more remote and therefore capital costs are likely to be higher; \n(iii) the PNP must repay a greater portion of the capital costs for new schemes through subproject \nloans (30% compared with 15% previously); (iv) PNP branch capacity is likely to be lower and \ntherefore less efficient; (v) inflation causes new schemes to have higher subproject specific tariffs \nthan existing systems; and (vi) new schemes are located in poorer districts and the ability to pay is \nlikely to be lower than in the provincial capital. \n10.  Lacking economies of scale, subproject water supply schemes typically charge much \nhigher tariffs than those charged by larger (provincial capital) schemes. Such tariffs may not be \naffordable for all customers and may make it difficult to gather customer support when the PNP \nelsewhere  is  applying  a  much  lower  tariff.  Subproject  water  supply  schemes  with  small \ncustomer bases would benefit from the application of a utility-wide tariff. By spreading the costs \nover  the  entire  customer  base  of  the  PNP,  the  utility  can  make  tariffs  affordable  for  all \ncustomers. Under a utility-wide tariff, the PNP needs only a single billing (computerized) system \nbecause the tariff structure is uniform. This means lower administrative costs for the utility. \n11.  Affordability and Willingness to Pay. An affordability analysis was conducted to ensure \nthat domestic consumers, especially those in the low-income group, can afford the projected \nwater tariff levels. The affordability analysis was done for 2011 (the assumed year that the \nsubproject becomes operational), and 2015. The results reveal that the percentage of monthly \nhousehold income spent on water, inclusive of the monthly meter rental and turnover tax, by the \naverage household and low-income group is below 5% in 2011 and 2015. Based on generally \naccepted principles, the projected water tariffs are therefore considered affordable. The monthly \nwater bill based on the proposed tariffs is within the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay as per the \nsocioeconomic survey results (Table A14.2). \nTable A14.2: Affordability and Willingness to Pay \n2011    2015 \nItem \nAve. HH  LIG  Ave. HH  LIG \nViengphoukha         \nTotal Monthly Bill for Water (KN)  24,618 16,590  30,383  18,050\nAverage Willingness to Pay for Piped Water (KN/month)  52,367   52,367 \nAverage Monthly Household Income (KN)  697,000 375,000  697,000  375,000\n% of Monthly Household Income Spent on Water   3.5 4.4  4.4  4.8\nHouixai     \nTotal Monthly Bill for Water (KN)  56,239 16,002  58,670  17,342\nAverage Willingness to Pay for Piped Water (KN/month)  51,923   51,923 \nAverage Monthly Household Income (KN)  1,488,000 390,000  1,488,000  390,000\n% of Monthly Household Income Spent on Water   3.8 4.1  3.9  4.4\nSongkhone     \nTotal Monthly Bill for Water (KN)  18,045 11,604  24,697  12,583\nAverage Willingness to Pay for Piped Water (KN/month)  82,473   82,473 \nAverage Monthly Household Income (KN)  1,276,000 390,000  1,276,000  390,000\n% of Monthly Household Income Spent on Water   1.4  3.0 1.9  3.2 \nAve= average, HH = household, LIG = low income group.  \nSource: ADB estimates.         \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  MPWT Decision 5336, 26 April 2004. \n ", "Appendix 14  63\nC.  Financial Performance of PNPs \n \n12.  PNP Financial Performance. Louang-Namtha and Bokeo PNPs incurred net losses from \n2004 to 2006 and it is estimated that they also incurred net losses in 2007. These losses are  due \nto low tariff levels, which are well below WASA\u2019s tariff recommendations. Savanakhet PNP had \npositive net income in 2004 but incurred losses in 2005 and 2006 due to low tariffs. Savannakhet \nPNP is estimated to have had a small net income for 2007 due to increased volume of water sold. \n13.  Projected Financial Performance. The projected financial performance of the PNPs for \n2008 to 2015 is presented in Table A14.3, with the key performance indicators. The financial \nprojections, which include the subprojects, indicate that the PNPs are projected to earn a positive \nnet income each year over the forecast period. More than 100% of annual depreciation expense \n(historical cost) is recovered during the forecast period. The PNPs are also projected to generate \npositive net cash flow each year over the forecast period, which can be used to fund much \nneeded rehabilitation and expansion work in its service area. As a result, the PNPs will require no \nfurther subsidies and will be able to fund all O&M expenses, service their debt, and generate an \nincreasing cash surplus. The debt service coverage ratio is projected to be above 1.2 times. \nTable A14.3: Summary of PNP Financial Projections (KN million) \nIndicator  Actual  Est.

Subproject Sustainability \n \n14.  The economic sustainability of the three sample subprojects depends on the subproject\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability. Unless the subproject is financially sustainable, the economic benefits \nassumed in the analysis will not materialize. The projected financial performances for the three \nsubprojects show that the agreed upon financial objectives of cost recovery (i.e., full O&M cost and \na gradually increasing portion of annual depreciation) and debt service (not less than 1.2 times) for \nthe sector could be met. Meeting the financial objectives of the sector indicates subproject financial \nsustainability. Attainment of the financial objectives, however, requires that tariffs are annually \nreviewed and adjusted in line with WASA\u2019s recommendations and kept at pace with inflation. \n ", "Appendix 15  65\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION FRAMEWORK AND SHORT LAND \nACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION PLANS \n \n1.  Short land acquisition and compensation plans (LACPs) have been prepared for the three \nsample subprojects in Huoixai, Viengphoukha and Songkhone as part of project preparation \n(Supplementary Appendix L). The land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) is category B or not \nsignificant in each of the three subproject towns. The number of affected persons experiencing \nmajor impacts is less than 200. A land acquisition and compensation framework (LACF) has also \nbeen prepared to guide the resettlement planning and implementation for future subprojects \n(Supplementary Appendix M). All ethnic groups affected are eligible for the same entitlements. \nSpecific measures for vulnerable groups, including some ethnic groupsand households headed \n \nby women, are included in the LACF and short LACPs. The LACPs and LACF have been based \non the relevant laws of Lao PDR and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. For each subproject found to \nrequire LAR, an LACP will be prepared by the project implementation units (PIUs), under the \nguidance of the PCU. Concerted efforts will be made to reduce the magnitude of displaced and \naffected people and only subprojects with insignificant resettlement and land acquisition will be \neligible  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  Since  priority  will  be  given  to  avoiding  or  minimizing \nresettlement and land acquisition, short LACPs will be prepared for this Project. Table A15.1 \nillustrates the estimated impacts for three sample subproject towns.  \nTable A15: Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \nAffected Households (AH) \nAH losing 10% or \nSubproject  Estimated Land  AH/  Total  AH to be  more of  Other \ntown  Acquisition (m2)  Shops  Population  Relocated  productive assets  Impacts \nHuoixai  3,250  m2  of  private  6   43  0  1  Temporary \nland (permanent)  impact on 1 \n200 m2 of private land  shop for pipe \n(temporary)  placement \nSongkhone  1,639 m2of private land  259  1,504  0  0  120 fruit \n(temporary)  trees \nViengphoukha  2,700 m2 of private  24  150  3 (shops)  1   \nland (permanent) \nSource: ADB and EA estimates. \n \n3.  Legal and Policy Framework. The policy framework and compensation entitlements are \ndeveloped from the relevant laws, decrees, and regulations of the Government of Lao PDR and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  In  Lao  PDR,  compensation  principles  and  the  policy \nframework for LAR are governed by the following regulations: (i) the Constitution, 1991, (ii) the \nLand Law, 2003, (iii) Road Law, 1999, (iv) Decree of the Prime Minister on Compensation and \nResettlement of People Affected by Development Project,1 and (v) Regulations for Implementing \nDecree  of  the  Prime  Minister  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  of  People  Affected  by \nDevelopment Project.2 Provisions and principles adopted in the LACF and LACPs supplement the \nprovisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  \n4.  Project principles for LAR are adopted in the LACF and each short LACP, and cover the \nbasic principle of minimizing (or avoiding wherever possible) LAR impacts on households and \ncommunities. Other areas include definition and eligibility of affected persons to compensation \nand rehabilitation, inventory of losses, communal land and structures, procedures for voluntary \ncontributions, budget availability, institutional arrangements, special attention and assistance to \nwomen, minority ethnic groups, and other vulnerable persons, mechanisms to redress affected \n                                                 \n1 No.192/PM/7 July 2005.  \n2 No.2432/STEA/11 November 2005. \n ", "66  Appendix 15 \npersons\u2019 grievances, compensation and rehabilitation measures, and preparation, disclosure and \nmonitoring of LACPs.  \n5.  Entitlements and compensation are based on the Project\u2019s social surveys, consultations, \nand the Government and ADB requirements and procedures. People eligible for compensation \nare those who will experience negative impacts on their assets or livelihoods as a result of the \nProject.  Affected  persons  who  appear  in  the  subprojects\u2019  census  returns  will  be  entitled  to \ncompensation  and  assistance.  Loss  of  land  will  be  compensated  for  through  land-for-land \narrangements or, if the affected persons prefer, cash compensation at an amount equal to the \ncurrent market value. For affected houses and structures, compensation and assistance will be \nequivalent to the provision of, or full replacement costs for, building a house or structure of the \nsame size and standard. Loss of unharvested annual crops will be compensated at current market \nvalue. Relocating households will receive subsistence allowances and affected persons belonging \nto vulnerable groups will be entitled to additional special allowances. The LACPs and the LACF \ncontain detailed entitlement matrixes summarizing types of impact, eligibility, and compensation.  \n6.  Consultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Redress.  At  the  early  stages  of  project \npreparation, local authorities, and leaders at different administrative levels were informed about \nthe project proposal, its objectives, and proposed activities. They were consulted on development \nneeds and resettlement issues, their perception of project objectives, technical designs, and their \ntasks and roles in project planning and implementation. Affected persons were informed about \nthe Project on an individual household basis and have been involved in developing the proposed \nresettlement and compensation packages. Draft LACPs have been disclosed to the affected \npeople, using locally appropriate information booklets. Further consultations will be undertaken \nbefore finalization of detailed design. A mechanism has been established to ensure that the \nconcerns  and  grievances  of  affected  persons  are  addressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and \nsatisfactory manner. Affected persons will be made fully aware of their rights and the grievance \nprocedures, verbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and at time of compensation.  \n7.  Implementation Arrangements. The project coordination unit (PCU) will coordinate all \nLAR activities. The PIUs will be responsible for LAR implementation, monitoring, and supervision. \nProvincial and district resettlement committees will include village focal person(s) who will actively \nparticipate in design and implementation of short resettlement plans. The PIU will prepare monthly \nprogress reports and a final report to the PCU upon completion of LAR activities. The PCU will \nconsolidate the information from the PIUs and other sources in its quarterly progress reports to \nADB. The PCU will engage an external monitor, acceptable to ADB, to monitor LAR activities. The \nexternal monitor will submit semiannual reports and a final evaluation to the PCU and ADB. The \nWithin 3 months of project completion, the PCU will submit a resettlement completion report \nbased on the agreed LACPs and financial audit statements approved by a third party. \n8.  The Executing Agency will be responsible for (i) administering resettlement workshops for \nprovincial and district officials; (ii) approving the LACF and short LACPs, with endorsement from \nprovincial and district governments; and (iii) forwarding the documents to ADB for concurrence. All \nresettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. ADB will issue a no \nobjection  to  civil  works  contract  awards  after  the  Government  has  satisfactorily  completed \ncompensation payments and relocation to new sites in accordance with the approved LACP. \nSupervision consultants will provide assistance during resettlement planning and implementation. \n9.  Cost and Budget. Adequate budgetary support will be made available to cover the \ncosts of LAR within the implementation period. Each subproject LACP will break down the \nbudget by type of loss with corresponding cost estimates. The budget will reflect replacement \ncosts at current market values, with adequate provision for contingencies. About $240,000 has \nbeen estimated to cover LAR costs, including implementation and contingencies. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090112111629+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: lao 36339, lao pdr, lao water supply and sanitation, lao water supply sector projects, lao small towns water supply projects, water supply and sanitation sector project", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090204141313+08'00'", "Title": "Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project"}, "author_page": " \n  WSRC  \u2013  Water Supply Regulatory Committee \n  WSSSP  \u2013  Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 September.
