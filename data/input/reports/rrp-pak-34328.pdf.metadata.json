Decentralization is a complex policy package to support \nthe  role  of \npoverty  and  governance  reforms  by  reengineering \ngovernment;  thoroughly  restructuring  Federal,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernmental  relations;  and  creating  a  third  tier  of  government \ncomprising  democratically  elected  councils  at  the  district,  tehsil  (sub-\ndistrict), and union levels.  \n \nIn light of the highly constrained fiscal situation; the uncertain political \nenvironment;  and  entrenched  traditions  of  privilege,  exclusivity,  and \npatrimonialism  at  all  levels  of  government,  the  scope  and  pace  of \nimplementation  of  decentralization  are  arguably  the  boldest  ever \nundertaken  by  a  developing  country.  The  legal  framework  for  these \nreforms,  including  ordinances  for  accounts,  audit,  police,  and  local \ngovernment, is already in place. Political decentralization, the first step \nin  the  governance  reforms,  occurred  over  a  remarkably  short  time \nbetween  March  2000  and  August  2001,  when  elections  were  held  to \nthe \ninstall \nimportance  of  gender  equity  in  decentralization,  a  key  break  from \nPakistan\u2019s political past was accomplished with an increased quota for \nwomen  representatives  (30%).  Women  now  comprise  32%  of \ncouncilors.  \n \nThe Local Government Ordinance (LGO) of 2001, the central plank of \ndecentralization,  clearly  assigns  powers  and \nlocal \nformulas,  systems,  and \ngovernments;  provides \nrevenue-generating  powers  for  local  government  financing;  ensures \nelected  representatives'  control  of  local  administrations;  empowers \nelected \nleaders  with  budget  and  expenditure  management \nresponsibilities;  and  creates  a  host  of  new  opportunities  for  citizen-\n\nlocal  government  councils.  Signaling \n\nrepresentative \n\ntransparent \n\nfunctions \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nObjectives and \nScope  \n\n \n \n \n\nand \n\naccountable, \n\nthe  vital  next  step \n\nthe  Program  will  support \nrepresentative, \n\nstate  interaction  to  improve  efficiency  and  equity,  accountability,  and \npublic  engagement  in  government  affairs.  The  important  challenge \nnow,  and  the  rationale  for  the  Program,  is  to  enable  the  Federal \nGovernment  to  bear  the  medium-term  costs  of  implementing  fiscal \nto  entrench  and  sustain \ndecentralization, \ndecentralization.  \n \nThe  Program  seeks  to  impact  on  poverty  by  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  improved  public  access  to  equitably  delivered  and \nsustainable services. As part of the Government\u2019s broader governance \nthe  development  of \nreform  agenda, \ndemocratically \ntransparent \narrangements  of  local  governance-delivering  services  efficiently  and \nequitably.  \n \nThe  program  objective  is  improved  local  government  representation, \naccountability,  and  efficiency,  resulting  in  improved  service  delivery \nthrough fiscal support for reforms in policy, legal, technical, and fiscal \ndomains.  This  objective  will  be  achieved  through  reforms  and \nassociated actions in three domains: (i) policies, laws, and regulations; \n(ii)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building;  and  (iii)  fiscal \nrestructuring and budgetary measures. The program scope will include \n(i)  the  mandates  of  key  Federal  institutions,  including  agencies \nresponsible \nfinance,  women\u2019s  development, \nsupreme audit, and accounts; (ii) provincial institutions responsible for \nintergovernmental fiscal, policy, regulation, and technical support; and \n(iii) the political and administrative organs of local governments at the \ndistrict, tehsil, and union levels. \n \nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  three  policy  outcomes,  each \nwith  corresponding  result  areas  and  supporting  policy  actions  judged \nessential  for  the  reform  process:  (i)  sufficient  and  effective  Federal \nsupport for decentralization and related reforms, including gender and \nsocial  development;  (ii)  effective  and  sustainable  province-local \nintergovernmental  relations;  and  (iii)  local  government  institutions \nmanaging resources accountably and equitably. \n \nImplementation  of  the  reform  agenda  is  supported  by  two  TA  loans, \none aiming to enhance local government performance, and a second \nto support implementation of the Gender Reform Action Plan (GRAP).  \n \n\nfor  decentralization, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nin \n\nforth \n\nlending \n\n \n \nA  loan  is  proposed  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  $65  million  (SDR \n49,107,000) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) with a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nwith  an  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nterms  and  conditions  as  are \nthereafter;  and  with  such  other \nsubstantially \nthe  Loan \nthose  set \nin  accordance  with \nAgreement.  \n \nA second loan is also proposed equivalent to  $205 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  with  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 3 years; an interest rate to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London \nfacility, \nInter  Bank  Offered  Rate-based \nincluding  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum  and  a  front  end \nfee of 1% of the loan amount; and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nThe  program  period  will  be  from  December  2002  to  December  2006. \nThe Government will be able to withdraw funds from the loan account \nfor a period of 4 years starting from loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  tranches  based  on  performance  in \nmeeting  specified  tranche  release  conditions.  The  first  tranche, \nequivalent to $120 million, will be available on loan effectiveness. The \nsecond  tranche  will  be  released  upon  compliance  with  11  specified \nconditions,  satisfactory  completion  of \nthe  June  2004  annual \nperformance review, as well as continued compliance with all previous \ntranche conditions. \n  \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  DSP, \nincluding  the  program  loans,  and  the  two  TA  loans.  Implementing \nagencies will include, at the Federal level, the Pakistan auditor general \n(PAG);  the  controller  general  of  accounts  (CGA);  the  National \nReconstruction  Bureau \nthe  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s \nDevelopment,  Social  Welfare  and  Special  Education  plus  provincial \ngovernments.  \n \nThe loans will finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  imports  procured  in  and  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  member  countries,  other  than  those \nspecified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  those  items  financed  by \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources.    The  Borrower  will \ncertify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given  period. \nADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \nThe counterpart funds, to be generated out of the loan proceeds, will \nbe  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  structural  adjustment,  including  the \ncosts to be borne by the Federal Government in transferring revenue \nto  local  governments  and  the  establishment  of  necessary  institutions \n\n(NRB);  and \n\nThe Program Loan \n \n \n  \n \n \n\nAmount and \nTerms \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nProgram  Period \nand Tranching \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n\nProcurement \n\nCounterpart  \nFunds \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nand facilities associated with the reforms. Disbursement will be made \nunder the simplified procedures for program loans, approved by ADB's \nBoard on 16 April 1998. \n \nTwo  TA  loans  equivalent  to  $30,000,000  (SDR  22,664,000)  for \ncapacity  building  associated  with  the  Program  will  be  provided  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Each TA loan will have a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the respective draft TA loan agreements. \n \nThis  TA  loan  will  be  used  to  support  Federal  (CGA,  PAG,  and  NRB) \nand  provincial  agencies  and  local  governments  to  build  capacities  in \n(accounts,  budget,  and \ncore  planning, \nfinance  management \nexpenditure  management),  procurement,  and  audit \nfunctions \nnecessary  for  efficient  and  equitable  service  delivery.  Investments  in \nTA  and  capacity  development  activities  will  be  made  in  11  thematic \nareas  considered  necessary  to  articulate  the  new  legal,  fiscal,  and \ninstitutional arrangements of decentralization. The total cost of the TA \nloan  is  estimated  to  be  $23  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange  costs  of  $6  million  and  $17  million  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency costs.  \n \nThis  TA  loan  will  be  used  to  support  implementation  of  the  GRAP, \nwhich the Government is preparing with support from the ADB Gender \nReform  TA  grant  (TA  3832-PAK).  Approval  by  the  Federal  and \nprovincial  cabinets  of  the  GRAP,  in  accordance  with  agreements \nalready made under TA 3832-PAK, will be a condition for effectiveness \nof this TA loan. The TA loan will support implementation of four central \npolicy  themes  in  gender  and  governance:  (i)  improving  women\u2019s \nrepresentation  and  participation \nin  political  and  administrative \nstructures;  (ii)  encouraging  a  policy  shift  from  social  welfare  to  social \ndevelopment, and from women\u2019s development to gender equality; (iii) \nrestructuring  of  national  institutions  and  procedures  dealing  with \ngender \nissues;  and  (iv)  engendering  planning  and  budgetary \nprocesses  with  the  aim  of  narrowing  the  gender  gap  in  public \nexpenditure  and  service  provision.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  is \nestimated  to  be  $7  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange \ncosts of $2.9 million and $4.1 million equivalent in local currency costs.\n \nThe  DSP  will  create  an  enabling  environment  for  pro-poor  service \ndelivery  and  political  representation  by  (i)  supporting  reforms  to \nreorganize  state  structures  and \nfiscal  sharing  arrangements, \ndecentralize delivery of basic services, and improve the accountability \nof  elected  and  administrative  public  officials;  (ii)  providing  budget \nsupport  to  enable  the  Federal  Government  to  bear  the  adjustment \ncosts  associated  with  intergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring,  thereby \nunderwriting  predictable,  timely,  and  transparent  transfers  to  local \ngovernments;  (iii)  providing  capacity  building  to  clarify  the  necessary \nrules  and  regulations  for  improved  intergovernmental  coordination  of \nprograms  and  services;  (iv)  helping  to  sustain  local  autonomy  by \n\nTechnical Assistance \nLoans \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nLocal Government \nPerformance \nEnhancement \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \nGender and \nGovernance \nMainstreaming \n \n\nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nto  decide  upon \n\nsupporting  improved  fiscal  information,  policy  analysis,  and  training \nsystems  to  improve  management  decision  making;  (v)  encouraging \ncitizen  engagement  in  planning  and  monitoring  service  delivery  and \nincreased  access  to  information  about  local  government  affairs;  and \n(vi) supporting a nationwide communications, strategic monitoring, and \nsocial  audit  process  to  systematically  and  publicly  communicate  and \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  decentralization  and,  in  particular, \nmonitor  changes  in  service  accessibility  and  equity  in  the  context  of \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper commitments. \n \nThe primary beneficiaries will be the men and women comprising local \ngovernments\u2019 constituencies who will be empowered to participate in a \npermanent  set  of  planning  and  budgetary  practices,  in  concert  with \naccountable,  elected \nthe \nlocal  representatives, \nallocation  of  resources  against  their  priorities  for  delivery  of  basic \nsocial, economic, administrative, and political entitlements.  \n \nImplementation  of  the  DSP  faces  formidable  risks.  There  are  risks  of \nhistorical legacy (including numerous failed past reform efforts) and of \nthe  contemporary  economic  and  political  context  (including  macro \nfiscal  constraints,  regional  tensions,  and  the  uncertain  stability  and \ncommitments  arising  from  the  forthcoming  national  and  provincial \nelections).  However,  many  of  the  important  Program-specific  risks \nhave been identified and mitigating measures anticipated:  \n\u2022  Medium term adjustment costs of decentralization may not be met \nwithout fiscal disruption or negative impacts on other reform priorities. \nAdjustment costs have been reflected in the targets agreed upon with \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth Facility.  \n\u2022  Changes may occur in government policies, which may interrupt or \nreverse  the  reform  process.  Whereas  the  presidential  referendum  in \nApril  2002  reduced  uncertainty  about  continuation  of  the  reform \nprogram,  the  Government  has  also  acted  to  provide  a  durable  legal \ncover \nincluding  proposed \nconstitutional amendments.  \n\u2022  Complementary  restructuring  and  reform  in  intergovernmental \n(Federal-provincial)  relations  may  not  occur  as  envisaged,  thus \nundermining \nlocal \ngovernment  fiscal,  regulatory,  and  policy  support  from  high  levels. \nMost  of  the  systems  and  procedures  to  be  implemented  under  the \nProgram  have  been  designed  sequentially,  to  allow  progressive \nmovement from the present to fully devolved modes of governance as \nconditions permit.  \n\u2022  There may be slow and uneven progress with reorienting existing \nkey  institutions,  and  in  establishing  the  necessary  capacities  in  new \ninstitutions (provincial and local).  Continued  policy  dialogue,  involving \nthe three levels of government and civil society, to allow adaptable and \nflexible  implementation  tuned  to  local  capacities  and  priorities  is  a \ncentral  feature  of  the  Program.  The  TA  loans  will  provide  a \ncomprehensive  menu  of  support  for  institution  building  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  \n\nthe  stability  and  predictability  necessary \n\nthe  key  provisions  of \n\nthe  LGO, \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fInadequate \n\n\u2022  Public  perceptions  of  a  disconnect  between  decentralization  and \nimproved  service  delivery,  political  accountability,  and  performance \nmay  undermine  constituency  support  for  the  reforms.  The  primary \nfocus  of  all  decentralized  planning,  budget/expenditure  management \nsystems  is  on  improved  performance  in  service  delivery,  access, \nequity, transparency, and public accountability.  \n\u2022 \nfor \nimproved  local  administrative  and  political  performance  may  lead  to \nfailure  to  improve  allocative  efficiency,  corruption,  and  wastage  of \nresources,  thus  undermining  the  legitimacy  of  the  reforms.

Pakistan  faces \n2. \nsevere  macroeconomic \nrising  poverty,  and \nunderdeveloped human capital (Supplementary Appendix A). During the 1990s, the fiscal deficit \nand  the  current  account  deficit  as  proportions  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged \n6.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The average economic growth rate decelerated from 6.5% in the \n1980s to 5.4% in the first half of the 1990s, and to 3.6% in fiscal year (FY) 2002. The incidence \nof  poverty  increased  from  26.6%  in  1992-1993  to  32.2%  in  1998-1999,  at  the  same  time  as \ninequality and transitory poverty increased and investments in development and social services \ndeclined.1 After a difficult period for Pakistan\u2019s economy and frequent changes in Government \nduring  much  of  the  1990s,  the  far-reaching  structural  reforms  initiated  and  accelerated  in \nparticular over the past 2 years have begun to yield results. The macroeconomic situation has \ngradually stabilized, though improvements in the poverty situation are yet to become evident.2 \n \n3. \nDebt,  Discretion,  and  Pro-Poor  Spending.  Chronic  fiscal  and  external  deficits  have \nresulted in the accumulation of large domestic and external debt. Total debt (both domestic and \nexternal)  equaled  115%  of  GDP  in  FY2001;  interest  payments  on  total  debt  accounted  for \nalmost 50% of the total government current expenditure; and, even after debt rescheduling, the \nexternal  debt  service  ratio  was  over  23%.  Against  the  backdrop  of  heavy  indebtedness, \nPakistan negotiated an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Standby Program amounting to $600 \nmillion  in  November  2000.    After  successful  completion  of  the  Standby  Program,  the  IMF \napproved  a  three-year  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  on  7  December  2001 \nand, during the same month signed the third debt restructuring agreement with the Paris Club. \nDuring 2002, following the successful rescheduling of its bilateral debt obligations and increased \ninflow  of  remittances  and  external  agency  funds,  gross  foreign  exchange  reserves  have \nincreased  to  more  than  $5  billion,  the  highest  amount  ever,  and  the  rupee  has  stabilized  and \nstrengthened.  \n \n4. \nThe Government has demonstrated strong commitment to reform, and its commitments \nto  poverty  reduction  and  governance  reforms,  articulated  in  the  Interim  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy Paper (IPRSP)3 and the PRGF, are generally on track.4 For FY2003, the budget share \nof  poverty-related  expenditures  has  significantly  increased.5  As  against  PRs119  billion  spent \n                                                 \n1 Transitory poverty is discussed in Appendix 1. Development spending as a percent of GDP declined from 7.2% in \nFY1992 to 2.8% a decade later. Public expenditure on education, health, and population, after increasing to 2.7% \nof GDP in the mid-1990s, declined to 2.1% of GDP in FY2001. \n\n2   For a more detailed assessment of economic issues and performance, see ADB. 2001.

See also Supplementary Appendix \n\nA. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nduring  FY2000-2001,  poverty  reducing  expenditures  increased  by  8%  to  PRs136  billion  in \nFY2001-2002, and are projected to increase by a similar margin to PRs161 billion in FY2002-\n2003.  The  Government's  commitment  to  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)/PRGF \nrequirements  is  evidenced  by  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  second  PRGF  Review  and \nrelease by IMF of a further $114 million on 3 July 2002. However, it is clear that the three main \ncomponents  of  expenditures,  namely  debt  servicing,  defense,  and  establishment  costs  for \nrunning  the  civil  government,  result  in  extremely  limited  fiscal  space  for  discretionary \nexpenditures  at  all  three  levels  of  government,  viz.,  district,  tehsil  (subdistrict),  and  union. \nincluding  more  efficient  vertical  assignment  of \nIntergovernmental \nexpenditure and revenue powers and an equalization of horizontal fiscal imbalances, both key \nconcerns of this Program are therefore central to both macroeconomic and governance reforms, \naiming  to  increase  local  revenue  mobilization,  improve  allocative  and  spending  efficiency,  and \ndirect  increased  resources  into  pro-poor,  local  services.  The  Government\u2019s  reforms  are \ntherefore  based  on  the  policy  presumption  that  there  is  a  direct  and  positive  linkage  among \nadherence to IPRSP and PRGF commitments, intergovernmental fiscal restructuring, enhanced \nlocal governance, improved service delivery, and poverty reduction.  \n \n\nrestructuring, \n\nfiscal \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n5. \nPakistan today faces a multitude of crises \u2013 some prompted by global events; others by \ngeopolitical  disagreements  persisting  since  the  formation  of  the  country;  and  yet  others \nmanifesting  chronic  conflicts  of  gender,  identity,  and  ethnicity.  Social  breakdown,  random \nviolence,  corruption,  a  collapse  of  the  rule  of  law,  patrimonialism  \u2013  these  widely  publicized \nconcerns are typically attributed to problems of governance. Yet, in the past 2 years, Pakistan\u2019s \ngovernment  has  introduced  far-reaching  policy  commitments  in  the  context  of  the  Interim \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  concerned  with  decentralization,  public  resource  management, \naccess to justice, gender reform, and social development, which could positively impact human \ndevelopment in ways never matched in modern Pakistani history.6  \n \n6. \nPoverty and the Role of the State. Pakistan faces severe problems in the performance \nof and access to basic services, literacy, poverty, and gender equality. The social gap, in terms \nof  differences  in  the  attainment  of  human  development  goals  between  income  classes,  urban \nand rural areas, and genders, and across provinces is large and constitutes a long-term crisis.7  \nBy any measure, poverty acutely and disproportionately affects women in Pakistan8 (Appendix \n2). Most marked in poor people\u2019s accounts of their vulnerability to poverty is the predatory and \ndysfunctional role of the local state (district, tehsil, and union level authorities). It is not just that \nthe  state  has  failed  to  deliver  basic  services  to  the  vast  majority  of  the  population  due  to  low \ninvestment in human development, unaccountable and centralized governance structures, and \ninefficient  service  delivery  systems.  Neither  is  it  simply  that  remedial  programs,  such  as  the \nSocial  Action  Program,  have  largely  been  unsuccessful,  partly  due  to  the  lack  of  local \n\n                                                 \n6  The broad agenda was laid out in the IPRSP, which was discussed in the Boards of the World Bank and IMF in \nDecember  2001  and  formed  the  basis  for  IMF\u2019s  PRGF  loan.  The  breadth  and  progress  of  these  reforms  are \nanalyzed  in  World  Bank.  2002.  Pakistan  Development  Policy  Review:  A  New  Dawn?  Washington,  DC.  The  full \nPRSP is planned for completion by the end of 2002. \n\n7  One  of  the  most  comprehensive  analyses  of  the  social  gap  in  Pakistan  is  Easterly,  W.  2001.  Pakistan's  Critical \n\nConstraint: Not the Financing Gap, but the Social Gap. World Bank, Washington, DC, February.  \n\n8    Pakistan's  ranking  in  the  United  Nation  Development  Programme's  Gender-related  Development  Index  2000,  is \n135th of 174 countries and, on the Gender Empowerment Measurement 1999, Pakistan\u2019s ranking is 100th of 102 \ncountries measured. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nmanagement  authority  or  incentives  to  deliver  the  best  programs  for  the  least  cost  to  the \nmaximum  number  of  patients,  students,  road  users,  dwellers,  or  citizens  generally.  The  local \nunits  of  the  provincial  government  responsible  for  these  services  were  typically  understaffed, \npoorly  equipped  and  trained,  unresponsive,  and  unaccountable  to  the  service  users.  Delivery \nfailures  exacerbate  vulnerability,  but  of  more  pronounced  impact  is  the  everyday  harassment, \nunderperformance,  exclusion,  and  denial  of  basic  rights  by  public  officials  of  people  who  are \ndisadvantaged  by  virtue  of  gender,  ethnicity,  or  economic  or  political  power.  This  source  of \nvulnerability  is  marked  in  three  aspects  of  the  lives  of  the  poor  (Appendix  1).  Vulnerability  is \nmuch  increased  by  the  rent-seeking  behaviors  of  local  officials  responsible  for  licensing  and \nregulating  economic  activities.  Further,  and  well  known,  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  is \ncontinually reaffirmed by the corruption of local officials, which hampers access to public goods \nand  services  \u2013  health,  education,  land  management,  etc.  Finally,  the  failure  of  government \ninstitutions  to  provide  adequate  redress  for  administrative  grievances,  access  to  basic \ninformation  about  entitlements  and  accountability,  or  inclusion  in  elementary  public  policy  and \ndecision making so essential for political justice greatly increases vulnerability to poverty. Local \ngovernment  performance,  the  primary  focus  of  the  DSP,  is  therefore  intimately  linked  with \nvulnerability and poverty.  \n \n7. \nBold Governance Reform for Service Delivery and Political Representation. In light \nof  the  chronic  problems  facing  inclusive  public  service  delivery  and  political  representation, \nPakistan\u2019s recent governance reforms are among the boldest ever undertaken by a developing \ncountry. The legal framework for these reforms, including ordinances for accounts, audit, police, \nand  local  government,  is  already  in  place  and  is  expected  to  be  given  a  durable  legal  status. \nPolitical  decentralization,  the  first  step  in  the  governance  reforms,  has  occurred  over  a \nremarkably short time. Between March 2000 and August 2001, the Government abandoned the \nformer  system  of  administrative  deconcentration,  and  elections  were  completed  to  install \nrepresentative councils at three levels of local government. Commitments to gender reform and \nsocial  development  are  seen  by  the  Government  as  integral  to  decentralization:  a  key  break \nfrom  Pakistan\u2019s  political  past  was  accomplished  with  30%  of  seats  reserved  for  women.  As  a \nresult a large number of women were elected, and they now comprise 32% of councilors. Efforts \nto  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  improved  state  \u2013  nongovernment  organization \nrelationships (e.g., policy, legal, and institutional arrangements) have also reached an advanced \nstage.  Pakistan\u2019s  present  decentralization  echoes  aspects  of  efforts  made  on  previous \noccasions  to  empower  local  authorities,  but  certain  features  distinguish  contemporary  policy \n(paras. 8 - 15; see also Appendix 3).  \n \nGovernance  Reforms  in  the  Context  of  Poverty  Reduction  Strategies.  While \n8. \nproblems  of  overcentralization,  civil  service  corruption,  and  the  need  for  improved  political \nrepresentation  feature  in  the  rationale  for  decentralization,  the  primary  legitimacy  for \ngovernance  reforms  rests  in  the  connection  made  with  poverty  reduction.  The  IPRSP  regards \ndecentralization  as  the  primary  means  to  improve  basic  service  delivery  (in  particular,  health \nand  education)  and  to  address  chronic  gender  and  social  gaps  in  human  development \nindicators.  In  this  respect,  Pakistan\u2019s  decentralization,  focusing  on  the  twin  issues  of  political \nrepresentation  and  service  delivery,  can  be  distinguished  from  more  instrumentally  focused \nconcerns with efficiency gains and right-sizing of government.   \n \n9. \nClear  Assignment  of  Powers  and  Functions  for  Local  Governments.  The  Local \nGovernment Ordinance (LGO) promulgated by provincial governments during August 2001, with \namendments during 2002, assigns clear powers, responsibilities, and service delivery functions \nto  three  levels  of  local  governments:  district,  tehsil,  and  union.  In  effect,  responsibilities  for \ndelivery  of  \"social  and  human  development  services\"  (e.g.,  primary  health,  education,  social \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ntaxes, \n\nthe  urban \n\nimmovable  property \n\nwelfare)  rest  at  the  district  level,  whereas  \"municipal  services\"  (e.g.,  water,  sanitation,  urban \nservices) reside at the tehsil level.  \n \n10. \nTransparent Formulas, Systems, and Revenue Assignments for Local Government \nFinancing.  Although  Pakistan  has  experimented  with  decentralization  before,  this  is  the  first \ntime  that  issues  of  fiscal  decentralization  have  been  addressed  in  a  concerted  way. \nDecentralization  requires  provinces  to  devise  transparent  mechanisms  to  transfer  revenues  to \nlocal  governments  in  the  form  of  formula-driven  block  grants,  which  will  not  be  earmarked  for \nspecific  uses.  The  ADB-supported  Fiscal  Decentralization  (FD)  TA9  has  helped  define \ndecentralized  systems  in  the  core  areas  of  revenue,  transfers,  accounting/audit,  procurement, \nbudget,  and  the  relationship  between  citizen  community  boards  (CCBs)  and  local  councils. \nThrough  the  Project  on  Improvement  of  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing  (PIFRA),  the \nGovernment has also developed core systems for reconciling and controlling expenditures from \nthe Federal level down to union councils. In tandem, the Government is clearly also committed \nto  ensure  that  sufficient  fiscal  resources  are  available  to  match  new  expenditure  obligations. \nTaxes  and  fees  have  been  introduced  and  assigned  to  local  governments  (e.g.,  statutory \ntax,  provincial  operation  and \neducation/health \nmanagement  grants).  Taking  into  account  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  over  the  DSP,  the \nGovernment  has  authorized  new  revenue  and  allocated  2.5%  of  general  sales  tax  (GST) \ncollections  into  the  divisible  pool  shared  among  provinces  according  to  National  Finance \nCommission  (NFC)  award.  These  resources  will  be  transferred  to  the  local  governments; \nverification of actual transfers will be possible through annual revised estimates.  \n \n11. \nElected  Officials  to  Control  Administration.  Prior  to  decentralization,  most  civil \nservants belonged either to the Federal or provincial cadres. For instance, high-level provincial \neducation  officials  belonged  to  the  Federal  cadre,  as  did  the  appointed  chief  district  officer, \nwhereas  district  education  officers,  teachers,  and  other  education  officials  belonged  to  the \nprovincial  cadre.    Decentralization  will  create  a  third,  district  cadre  of  civil  servants  and, \ndepending on the province arrangement, staff up to Grade 16 or 17 will report directly to district \ngovernments.  Responsibility  for  payroll,  recruitment,  and  discipline  will  be  assigned  to  local \ngovernments.10 Even in the short term, all civil servants in the local governments work under the \nadministrative  authority  of  the  elected  executive  (Appendix  3).    These  actions  are  part  of  a \nlarger civil service reform effort presently being formulated with World Bank assistance.  \n \n12. \nBudget and Expenditure Management by Elected Leaders. Local governments now \ndetermine  budgets  and  expenditures  for  most  services,  whereas  only  the  policy,  standard-\nsetting,  and  monitoring  functions  remain  with  the  provincial  and  Federal  governments.  Higher \nlevels of government will provide additional, special purpose, and conditional transfers to local \ngovernments as the primary means to encourage particular policy outcomes \u2013 e.g., in relation to \npoverty  reduction,  local  economic  development,  and  natural  resource  management.  The \ndifferent \"windows\" of the new Federal Education Sector Reform provide one recent example of \nthis new form of intergovernmental relations in Pakistan. \n \n13. \nNew  Intergovernmental  Roles  and  Responsibilities.      There  are  new  de  jure  roles \nand  responsibilities  for  different  levels  of  government,  extending  from  the  Federal  level  to  the \npoint at which services are delivered, (e.g., the school management committees).  De facto, the \nintergovernmental system is still in transition, with many local personnel considering themselves \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Fiscal Decentralization (TA 3621). Manila. \n10  In  some  sectors  (such  as  education  and  health)  this  transfer  of  responsibility  to  local  governments  has  already \n\noccurred. Remaining sectors will be transferred over the next 12 months on a province-by-province basis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nto still be provincial staff, with district budgets still largely defined at the provincial level, and with \nsome provinces still defining the composition and responsibilities of such mechanisms as school \nmanagement committees. Other institutions like the local government commissions (LGCs) are \nnascent and lack the capacity to perform their roles effectively. For higher levels of government, \nthe  transition  from  a  command  and  control  relationship  with  local  authorities  to  a  policy, \nmentoring, and regulatory relationship will be painful and protracted.  \n \n14. \nNew Political Relationships and Powers. Decentralization has resulted in elected local \nofficials (nazims and councilors) at all three levels: district, tehsil, and union. The reservation of \n50%  of  seats  for  women,  peasants,  and  workers  at  all  three  tiers  has  created  space  for \ndisadvantaged sections of the society to enter into local governance structures to articulate their \nclass,  group,  and  gender  interests  (Appendix  2).  In  addition,  the  LGO  seeks  to  institutionalize \nbottom-up  demands  for  local  development  projects  that  have  not  been  attended  to  under  the \nexisting  centralized  system.  The  CCB  system  authorized  by  the  LGO  earmarks  25%  of  the \ndevelopment budget for investments identified by CCBs as part of this effort to stimulate local \ncivil society and build more durable citizen-government relations. In the regulatory/legal sphere, \nwhile  decentralization  has  focused  on  the  LGO  and  the  forthcoming  police  ordinance, \ndecentralization will positively affect an unprecedented number of laws regulating relationships \nbetween the state and the citizen. \n \n15.  Women\u2019s Empowerment and Gender Reforms. Reservation of 30% seats for women \nin all three tiers of local government has enabled a large number of women (more than 30,000) \nto enter into local politics. Government is also committed to developing a policy framework and \ninstitutional  mechanism  that  is  capable  of  reducing  gender  disparities.  A  key  focus  of \ngovernance  reforms  is  how  to  develop  politically  viable,  efficient,  effective,  and  properly \nresourced  local  institutions  and  systems  that  are  capable  of  sustaining  and  responding  to  the \nissues  of  women's  practical  and  strategic  needs,  and  have  the  power  and  autonomy  to \nadvocate women's emancipation and development before the state and society.    \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n16. \nFiscal  Decentralization  -  the  Next  Challenge.  FY2002  was  regarded  as  a  transition \nyear  in  fiscal  decentralization.  The  key  challenge  now  is  to  fully  implement  new  systems  and \nprocedures  that  fully  articulate  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  a  people-centered  system  of \nlocal  governance  based  on  internationally  established  norms  and  principles.  For  the  above-\nmentioned developments to be effectively embedded institutionally, for decentralization to work \nefficiently,  and  for  it  to  be  sustained,  it  is  essential  that  there  be  opportunities  for  all  citizens, \nmen and women, to voice their preferences about the allocation of resources through decisions \nmade  by  elected  leaders.  Successful  and  durable  decentralization  in  any  context  requires \nassurance  that  funds  transferred  or  spent  directly  will  be  controlled  consistent  with  clear \nstandards, regular reports, and accurate accounts. Failure to have systems in place to perform \nthese  basic  functions  risks  increased  public  dissatisfaction  with  local  government  and  can \nthreaten the progress of decentralization. Support to this process must therefore focus on both \nthe administrative and political aspects of three dimensions of accountability: between levels of \ngovernment,  between  administrators  and  elected  leaders,  and  between  councilors  and  the \ncitizenry.  The  dual  focus,  administrative  and  political,  is  needed  to  support  the  permanent \nestablishment  of  a  set  of  planning  and  budgetary  practices  through  which  citizens,  in  concert \nwith  accountable,  elected  local  governments,  are  given  responsibility  to  decide  on  service \ndelivery with the authority to impose taxes and fees to finance these services. The LGO, and the \ndetailed systems and procedures for decentralized service delivery and political representation \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthe  existing  state  of \n\ndeveloped under the FD TA, provide an ideal opportunity for ADB to assist the Government in \naddressing this challenge.  \n \n17. \nLarge  Mandates,  Constrained  Resources,  Disparate  Capacities.  The  obstacles  are \nformidable.  The  local  government  sector  is  small  \u2013  measured  by  percentage  of  total \nconsolidated  expenditures11  \u2013  and  has  minimal  own-source  revenues,  but  has \nlarge \nresponsibilities for delivery of basic services. Controls are overcentralized, yet local officials are \nunderregulated.  There  are  few  incentives  for  improved  performance  or  better  accountability. \nUnderresourced,  local  governments  are  responsible  for  spending  a  large  proportion  of  their \nresources  on  priorities  earmarked  by  provincial  and  Federal  authorities,  thus  constraining  the \nability of elected councilors to respond to their constituents' needs. Local governments also vary \ngreatly in their capacity to implement decentralization.12 Where such capacity is very low, as in \nBalochistan, interim steps will be required as an alternative to full decentralization. For example, \neconomies-of-scale criteria may suggest that district service units be combined or pooled (e.g., \nto  perform  road  maintenance  or  other  service  functions)  as  an  interim  system.  During  this \ninterim  period  between \nlegally  authorized  but  unimplemented \ndecentralization  and,  more  stringent  provincial  regulation  of  district,  tehsil,  and  union  activities \nmay be required.  \n \n18. \nContextual Realities to be Acknowledged. Despite the substantial progress, important \nfeatures of the Pakistan context will affect the implementation of decentralization. These include \n(i) macroeconomic space, (ii) political instability and the rule of law, and (iii) provincial diversity \nand  variation.13  The  Government  cannot  borrow  or  spend  beyond  the  limits  of  fiscal \nsustainability  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  This  puts  real  limits  on  cash  availability  to  finance \ninstability, \nthe \nundoubtedly  of  major  impact  on  decentralization,  will  also  contribute  to  fiscal  instability  and \njeopardize the foundation of decision-making needed by newly elected local officials to establish \ntheir  legitimacy  with  their  constituents.  Of  lasting  significance  is  the  collapse  in  the  rule  of  law \nand the impact this has on governance reforms. Public office is widely regarded, by citizens and \nincumbents  alike,  to  be  an  opportunity  for  pilferage  and  patronage,  and  entrenched  practices \nare  unlikely  to  be  interrupted  in  the  short  term.  Substantial  provincial  and  district  variation  will \nundoubtedly  produce  uneven  patterns  of  implementation  and  compliance  with  both  legality \ncontrols  and  basic  governance  and  service  delivery  norms.  Some  provinces  such  as  Sindh \noperated  predecentralization  accounting  systems;  others  such  as  Balochistan  have  combined \ndistrict  offices  and  operate  mixed  administration  systems  such  as  the  tribal  police.  The \nchallenge will be to ensure that diversity, while posing potential constraints on implementation of \ndecentralization, is not used as a pretext for a return to the command and interdiction styles of \ngovernance  typical  of  the  past,  but  are  understood  as  features  of  the  local  reality  requiring \nmodification of the program of decentralization, to encourage the possibility of local innovation \nand adaptation.  \n \n19. \nTechnical Constraints to be Ameliorated. The technical constraints are of three kinds: \n(i) structural, (ii) systemic, and (iii) capacity. First, the macro political and fiscal level \"structures\" \nor  existing  networks  of  roles  and  institutions  established  to  achieve  particular  public  functions \nhave proven inadequate and require major revision and definition. Intergovernmental roles and \nresponsibilities  have  not  been  properly  clarified.  For  example,  districts  are  responsible  for \n\ntransfers  and  revenue  sources  promised \n\nfor  decentralization.  Political \n\n                                                 \n11  Supplementary Appendix B, Table 1. \n12  Supplementary  Appendix  B,  Tables  6-9  on  district-wise  fiscal  variability  as  a  surrogate  indicator  for  variable \n\n13  On interprovince and interdistrict diversity, refer to Supplementary Appendix B. \n\ncapacity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\npaying teachers, but pay grades and rates are set by the Federal Government.14 This creates \nperverse  incentives  and  distorts  decentralization  objectives.  Hierarchical  relationships  among \ndistricts, tehsils, and unions are not clear (e.g., union councils lack inputs into the \"higher tier\" \nplanning  and  budgeting  systems  of  the  district  councils)  and  power  plays  between  local  units \ncontribute  to  unpredictable,  changeable  relationships  that  are  not  conducive  to  stable  service \ndelivery. The relationships between council members \u2013 particularly those representing women, \npeasants,  and  workers  \u2013  and  the  nazims  (mayors)  also  lack  either  informal  norm-based \nconventions  or  formal  rules  to  structure  decision-making.  This  leads  to  breakdowns  in \ncommunications  between  branches  of  local  government  over  critical  issues  such  as  budget \napproval. \n \n20. \nSecond, major core systems for decentralization have not been implemented including, \nfor  example,  those  for  performance  budgeting,  participatory  and  gender  awareness  planning, \nprocurement, commitment-based accounting, and shifts from pre-audit to post-audit. Similarly, a \nfiscal transfer formula to stimulate performance and/or local revenue mobilization has yet to be \nagreed  upon  and  implemented.  Local  political  systems  have  not  been  formalized  and \nimplemented.  Relationships  between  the  executive  and  elected  politicians,  and  councils, \nnazims, and the public have not been clarified, especially over the issue of CCB inputs into the \ndevelopment  project  planning  and  budgeting  process.  Similarly,  councilors  are  not  keen  to \nconsider raising new taxes, or indeed to raise the rates on existing taxes.  The representation \nand influence of women councilors requires concerted attention. Women councilors are by and \nlarge  ignored  by  male  nazims  of  district,  tehsil,  and  union  councils.    Women  councilors  who \nhave been elected through indirect vote at the tehsil and district level face constant rejection by \nmale councilors for not having their own constituency and refusal to include them in decisions \nabout  development  funds.  Attitudinal  change  is  imperative,  but  attention  must  be  given  to \nwomen councilors\u2019 lack of clarity over council rules of business, their roles as women councilors, \ntheir  relations  with  constituencies,  and  their  limited  administrative  capacity  to  influence  policy, \nplanning, and budgeting processes. Until these kinds of issues are addressed, decentralization \nwill not deliver what is intended.  \n \n21. \nThird,  capacity  building  has  not  been  particularly  effective.  The  bulk  of  courses  are \ndelivered  by  simple,  rote  methods  with  outdated  materials.  The  participants  are  not  trained  to \nperform better on the job or to become managers who take decisions with resources to serve \ncitizens; rather they are certified for purposes of pay and promotion by trainers who themselves \nlack incentives to do a good job because the state training institutions are viewed, as in many \ncountries,  as  highly  undesirable  assignments  for  civil  servants,  and  therefore  do  not  attract \npeople with the right skills and qualities. The work of political education of elected officials faces \nthe  same  problems.  Institutions  are  needed  that  can  provide  both  nazims  and  councilors  with \ninnovative training so that they more clearly understand their roles in the context of competing \npriorities  and  begin  to  work  cooperatively  in  a  way  that  will  serve  the  broader  public  interest. \nMoreover,  the  nearly  50%  of  council  members  representing  women,  peasants,  and  workers \nhave special training needs to serve their constituencies effectively. The constraint to capacity-\nbuilding reform is a legacy of mass, rote training in narrow, specialized but simple administrative \ntasks.  This  tradition  restricts  the  range  of  personal  accountability  and  prevents  taking \nresponsibility for entrepreneurial decisions to serve the public. Management professionalism is \ninhibited  by  lack  of  innovative  capacity  building,  which  reinforces  conservative  civil  service \npractices, systems, and structures.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  See Appendix 3 on civil service reforms.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCapacity  Development  for  Professional  Competency  and  Political  Accountability. \n22. \nCapacity development is broader than capacity building (Supplementary Appendix C). It focuses \non public access to information and improved political literacy among constituencies, through to \ndevelopment of political and administrative skills and improvements in the underlying systems to \nwhich they will be applied. Access to information, suitable to a poorly literate citizenry and lower \ncouncil  membership,  is  of  fundamental  importance,  especially  in  light  of  the  traditionally \nsecretive and exclusionary nature of the Pakistani executive. Capacity development must move \nbeyond  traditional  development  and  delivery  of  training  packages  to  the  institutionalization  of \nprofessional training institutions and new mechanisms to select the best providers on the basis \nof  transparent  performance  criteria  combining  political  and  technical  contents  in  training. \nTraining will need to focus on filling gaps in skills measured from a base for purposes of post-\ntraining  evaluation  of  effectiveness  in  imparting  skills  as  well  as  improving  the  performance  of \nprovincial  and  local  institutions  served  by  selected  participants.  Capacity  development  also \nextends  to  improvements  in  basic  systems,  such  as  accounting  and  budgeting,  internal \ncommunications,  performance  management,  and  procurement  from  efficiency,  gender,  and \npoverty perspectives.  \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n23. \nThe  Country  Strategy  and  Program  confirms  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  supporting \nPakistan\u2019s ambitious governance reforms, the central pillar to the poverty reduction strategy. In \nparticular,  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  notes  that  \"successful  implementation  of \ngovernance  reforms,  notably  in  accordance  with  Government\u2019s  commitments  to  legal,  judicial, \npolice,  and  civil  service  reforms;  and  government  restructuring  consistent  with \nthe \ndecentralization  plan,  is  central  to  achieving  Pakistan\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction \ngoals.  Therefore,  good  governance  is  the  major  focus  of  the  strategy.\"15  The  main  thrust  of \nADB\u2019s assistance to this governance-focused poverty reduction strategy is two-fold: (i) efforts to \nenhance  access  to  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  and  social  justice,  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment's  policy  \u201cto  bring  justice  to  the  doorstep\u201d  of  all  citizens;  and  (ii)  decentralization, \ngovernmental  restructuring,  and  gender  and  social  development.  Support  to  justice  reforms  is \nthe focus of two ongoing TAs16 and the Access to Justice Program (AJP), a $350 million poverty \nintervention approved in late 2001. The Fiscal Decentralization TA,17 underway since May 2001, \nand  the  Gender  Reform  TA18  provide  the  framework  for  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  ADB\u2019s \nsupport for implementation of the decentralization, which is the core of the Government's effort \nto  improve  service  delivery  and  political  representation,  and  through  this  have  an  impact  on \npoverty reduction. The majority of ADB\u2019s CSP lending commitments will draw upon the systems, \nprocedures, and institutional arrangements supported by the proposed program (Supplementary \nAppendix  D).  Further,  by  virtue  of  ADB\u2019s  support  to  TAs  on  gender  reform,  fiscal \ndecentralization,  NGO-Government  cooperation,  and  access  to  justice,  the  proposed  program \nlinks  well  with  both  ongoing  commitments  and  collateral  support  by  other  aid  agencies  for \ngovernance reforms (Supplementary Appendix E). The agreements on the DSP are reflected in \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002. Country Strategy and Program (2003-2005): Pakistan. Manila.  \n16 ADB. 2000.

The \nProgram Framework is in Appendix 5.  \n \nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nis \n\nimproved \n\nlocal  government \n\n24. \nThe Program seeks to have an impact on poverty by creating an enabling environment \nthrough implementation of systems, procedures, and fiscal arrangements that will result in local \ngovernments  more  efficiently  and  effectively  mobilizing  and  managing  resources,  thus \nfacilitating improved public access to equitably delivered and sustainable services. This is to be \nachieved  by  (i)  enabling  the  Federal  Government  to  bear  the  revenue  costs  of  shifting \nsubstantial fiscal resources on a sustainable basis to provinces and local governments; and (ii) \ntaking  actions  to  empower  local  governments  and  citizens  to  ensure  local  governments  and \nprovinces responsively, accountably, and effectively function in ways fully consistent with their \nnew mandates under the decentralization policy. The DSP is designed to establish direct links \nbetween  high-level  policy  reforms  (governance  and  poverty  reduction)  and  policy  outcomes  in \nthe  legal,  institutional,  and  fiscal  domains  that  improve  public  access  to  basic  services  and \nentitlements,  particularly  impacting  on  people  traditionally  excluded  and  marginalized.  A  key \nintegral and crosscutting aim of the Program is to promote implementation of the Government\u2019s \ncommitments  on  gender  reform  and  social  development,  the  latter  focusing  on  the  most \nvulnerable sections of the population.  \n \n25. \nThe purpose of the Program is to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nthrough  the  implementation  of  reform  policies  on  decentralization,  gender,  and  social \ndevelopment.  The  program  objective \nrepresentation, \naccountability, and efficiency underwriting improved service delivery. The policy objectives are \n(i) sufficient and effective federal support for decentralization and related reforms; (ii) effective \nand sustainable province-local intergovernmental relations; and (iii) local government institutions \nmanaging  resources  accountably  and  equitably,  contributing  to  efficient  and  equitable  delivery \nof  services  by  public  and  private  sector  agencies  according  to  clearly  established  norms  of \npublic participation, access to information, and accountability.  \n \n26. \nThese  objectives  will  be  achieved  through  reforms  and  associated  actions  in  three \ndomains: (i) policies, laws, and regulations; (ii) institutional strengthening and capacity building; \nand  (iii)  fiscal  restructuring  and  budgetary  measures.  The  program  scope  will  include  (i)  the \nmandates  of  key  Federal  institutions,  including  agencies  responsible  for  decentralization, \nfinance,  women\u2019s  development,  supreme  audit,  and  accounts;  (ii)  provincial  institutions \nresponsible  for  intergovernmental  fiscal,  policy,  regulation  and  technical  support;  and  (iii)  the \npolitical and administrative organs of local governments at the district, tehsil, and union levels. \n \n27. \nThe  DSP  has  a  number  of  innovative  features:  (i)  the  provision,  through  a  Federal \nprogram,  of  budget  support  to  enable  the  Federal  Government  to  bear  the  medium-term \nrevenue  impact  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  reforms;  (ii)  targeted  technical  assistance  for \ncapacity development tailored to diverse provincial and local government circumstances; (iii) a \nfocus  on  relatively  few  policy  conditions  that  reaffirm  prior  commitments  by  government  to \nestablish a sound legal, institutional, and fiscal base for the reforms; complemented by (iv) an \nannual  policy  dialogue  through  which  local,  provincial,  and  Federal  stakeholders,  both \ngovernment  and  civil  society,  can  jointly  examine  implementation  progress  and  determine \npriorities for allocation of technical and budgetary resources made available under the DSP; (v) \nmainstreaming of associated reform commitments to gender and social development throughout \nthe  new  institutions  and  systems  of  decentralization;  (vi)  a  focus  on  both  political  and \nadministrative  systems  through  which  local  governments  are  capable  of  supplying  services  in \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nresponse  to  demands  articulated  by  the  public,  as  a  result  of  better  access  to  information, \nengagement  in  budget  and  planning  processes,  and  clear  procedures  for  the  resolution  of \ndisputes  and  grievances;  and  (vii)  a  commitment,  through  well-defined  and  resourced \narrangements,  for  monitoring  changes  in  service  delivery  and  public  perception  of  trends  in \naccountability,  equity,  and  accessibility  in  services  delivered  by  local  governments  and  linking \nthis directly into ongoing program implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n28. \nThe  Government  is  aware  that,  although  the  Decentralization  Plan  2000,  and  the \npromulgation  of  key  laws  on  accounts,  audit,  local  government,  and  police  reforms  clearly \ndemonstrate  the  breadth  of  the  governance  reform  commitments,  it  has  not  yet  updated  the \nDecentralization Plan to fully articulate its medium-term vision (Appendixes 2 and 3). Following \nthe  October  2002  national  and  provincial  elections,  a  key  task  will  be  to  reconfirm,  in \nconsultation  with  elected  representatives,  the  Government\u2019s  governance  reform  policies  and \ncorresponding policies for governance reform program and a corresponding program for gender \nand social development (both directly supported by DSP) and produce the appropriate medium \nterm policy documentation through the parliamentary process.  \n \n29. \nThe reforms supported under the Program Loan are depicted graphically in Appendix 4, \nFigure  A4.  The  DSP  has  been  structured  to  directly  link  (i)  policy  outcomes  with  (ii)  defined \nresult  areas  and  (iii)  corresponding  policy  actions  and,  through  the  TA  loans,  connect  to  (iv) \nspecific  capacity  development  activities  and,  in  turn,  to  (v)  outputs  monitored  directly  by  the \nprogram institutions, and wider monitoring of public expenditure and service delivery outcomes \nunder  the  PRSP.  The  Program  Loan  will  finance  the  costs  involved  in  carrying  out  specific \nactions. Actions for release of the first tranche focus on legal, institutional, and fiscal measures \nat  the  Federal  and  provincial  levels.  Actions  for  the  second  tranche,  targeted  for  July  2004, \nemphasize  the  results  of  the  legal,  institutional,  and  fiscal  measures  introduced  earlier.  For \ninstance,  whereas  the  Government  will,  for  the  first  tranche,  cause  amendments  to  be \npromulgated  to  the  LGO,  and  the  TA  loans  (paras.  61-69)  will  provide  technical  support  and \ncapacity  development  to  provinces  and  local  governments  to  implement  these  provisions,  the \nsecond  tranche,  18  months  later,  will  evaluate  local  government  performance  against  these \nprovisions.  Similarly,  budgetary  allocations  made  by  the  Federal  Government  under  the  first \ntranche  will,  under  tranche  2,  be  verified  to  actual  expenditures  and  transfers  made  by  the \nFederal  and  provincial  governments  to  local  governments.  Progress  between  tranche  1  and \ntranche 2 will be assessed first through a consultative policy dialogue, the annual performance \nreview (APR) (para. 59), which will engage local, provincial, and Federal stakeholders in concert \nwith  the  ADB.  This  approach  to  policy  dialogue  and  conditionality  is  consistent  with  that \napproved for the AJP and has been much noted by the Government and the aid community has \nan innovative feature of the Program. Second, TA resources made available under the DSP will \nspecifically  support  targeted  poverty  monitoring  through  (i)  budget/expenditure  analysis \n(disaggregated  by  gender),  (ii)  community  social  audits  carried  out  nationwide,  (iii)  nationwide \nextension  of  a  service  delivery  database,  and  (iv)  explicit  connection  with  the  monitoring \nframework currently being developed for the PRSP.  \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s evaluations of policy-based lending, revised policies on program lending, as well \nas  evaluations  of  service  delivery  projects  in  Pakistan  have  been  reviewed  and  considered.19 \n                                                 \n19 ADB.  1996.

Svensson. 1998: What Explains the Success or Failure of Structural Adjustment Programs? World \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nEvaluations show that, in a complex and uncertain environment, care should be taken against \ntoo many conditionalities, excessive details, and inflexibility. Conditionalities are, in other words, \nbest seen as working hypotheses to focus domestic dialogue within government, and between \ngovernment  and  a  diverse  range  of  civil  society  and  private  agencies.20  Two  features  of  the \nprogram  reflect  experience.  First,  the  DSP  has  adopted  a  particular  approach  to  tranche \nconditionalities. It will promote outcomes only where there is a prior policy commitment and will \nfocus  on  defining  legal  and  regulatory  arrangements  whereby  policies  can  be  given  durable \naffect. Where this has been secured, the DSP will support the establishment of corresponding \ninstitutional arrangements at the Federal, provincial, and local government levels. Finally, where \nthese  institutional  establishments  have  yet  to  become  fully  functional,  the  DSP  will  assist  in \ndeveloping  capacities  whereby  they  may  be  administratively  extended  (such  as  at  the  local \ngovernment  levels)  or  fully  articulated  into  a  variety  of  arrangements  for  more  citizen-\ngovernment  engagement  in  local  governance.  Second,  evaluations  of  policy-based  lending \nhighlight the importance of coherent, coordinated linkage among externally supported initiatives. \nThe  DSP  will  be  explicitly  linked  with  key  external  support  to  decentralization  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). The DSP will link with World Bank support in four respects: (i) the establishment of \ncapacity  (in  legal,  institutional,  and  human  resources,  and  in  budgetary  terms)  of  the  Pakistan \nAuditor General and Controller General of Accounts, (ii) common commitment to operationally \nrelevant policy research on decentralization and service delivery,21 (iii) extension of the \"PRSP \napproach\"  to  local  government  budget  and  expenditure  management,  and  (iv)  structural \nadjustment  credits  in  Sindh  and  North-West  Frontier  Province.  Efforts  will  also  be  made  to \nensure that the Government\u2019s commitments under the DSP are fully articulated in preparation of \nthe forthcoming Poverty Reduction Support Credit. Further, the DSP will assist in establishing a \nwider framework for bilateral agency support to decentralization. Notably, it is envisaged that the \nDSP will involve cofinancing by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development \n(DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).22  Finally, the government \nagencies  of  focus  in  this  program  (Ministry  of  Women  Development's,  Social  Welfare  and \nSpecial Education [MWD]; National Reconstruction Bureau [NRB]) are supported in common by \nthe United Nations Development Programme and bilateral agencies, including the governments \nof Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland.23 \n \n31. \nThe policy reform agenda, to be financed through the program loan, is complemented by \nTA  loan  financing,  one  for  Local  Government  Performance  Enhancement,  for  institutional \nrestructuring,  strengthening,  and  capacity  building  of  Federal,  province  and  local  government \ninstitutions; and a second, Gender and Governance Mainstreaming, to support both integrated \nand specially targeted actions consistent with Federal and provincial government commitments \nto gender and social development.  \n \n32. \nThe  DSP  is  structured  around  three  policy  outcomes,  each  with  corresponding  result \nareas and supporting policy actions determined as essential for the reform process: (i) sufficient \nand  effective  Federal  support  for  decentralization  and  related  reforms,  including  gender  and \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nBank,  Washington,  DC;  ADB.  2001.

Toward a Political Economy Approach to Policy-Based Lending, EDRC, ADB, Manila.  \n21 The former initiative refers to the World Bank-supported Project to Strengthen Accountability and Reporting, which \nis expected to become effective in FY2004, and the latter to the World Bank/Government-approved Concept Note \non Devolved Service Delivery (August 2002). \n\n22 DFID and CIDA have made firm commitments to cofinancing aspects of the DSP.  \n23 These include the Decentralization Trust for Community Empowerment, MWD, and province-focused governance \n\nreform programs.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nsocial  development;  (ii)  effective  and  sustainable  provincial-local  intergovernmental  relations; \nand (iii) local government institutions managing resources accountably and equitably. \n \n\n1. \n\nSufficient  and  Effective  Federal  Support  for  Decentralization  and  Related \nReforms, including Gender and Social Development \n\n33. \nReforms  under  this  policy  outcome  focus  on  support  for  the  Federal  Government\u2019s \nimplementation  of  actions  in  the  policy,  legal,  fiscal,  and  institutional  domains  relating  to \ndecentralization  and  gender  and  social  development  to  (i)  ensure  adequate  laws  and \nregulations to underpin new institutional arrangements; (ii) effect fiscal restructuring to transfer \nfiscal  powers  and  resources  to  provinces  and  local  governments  in  accordance  with  their \nmandates;  and  (iii)  build  capacities  at  the  provincial  and  local  government  levels  to  adopt  and \nfully practice new systems and procedures for decentralized governance, in particular within the \ndomains of agencies responsible for accounts and audit, and gender and social development. \nAppendix 2 outlines the intended scope and focus of the Gender Reform Action Plan (GRAP). A \nkey  aspect  of  program  support  to  this  policy  outcome  includes  (i)  establishment  of  national \ncapacity for direct input by citizens into the political process of policy formulation (e.g., through \ncommunity social audit), (ii) support for the establishment and nationwide extension of a service \ndelivery  database,  and  (iii)  integration  of  the  DSP  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  with  the \nPRSP  monitoring  system  currently  being  developed.  Further,  at  an  operational  level,  both  TA \nloans will include special-purpose action research studies on the linkages between the reforms \nand  pro-poor  outcomes,  and  technical  support  for  review  and  analysis  by  implementing \nagencies (provincial and local) of the impact of new systems on service delivery, accessibility, \nand equity. \n \n\n2. \n\nEffective and Sustainable Provincial-Local Intergovernmental Relations \n\n34. \nReforms  under  this  policy  outcome  will  support  the  development  of  rule-based  and \nintegrated  relationships  between  provincial  and  local  governments,  resulting  in  sufficient \ntechnical, political, and fiscal support and regulation of local government affairs consistent with \nnational  policy  and  provincial  priorities.    Support  to  provinces  under  the  DSP  will  take  note  of \nexisting  and  planned  province-focused  public  sector  reform  programs  in  Sindh,  Punjab,  and \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) (supported by the World Bank and ADB), and will seek to \nreinforce  initiatives  taken  by  the  government  of  Balochistan.  Given  the  province-focused \nprograms in Sindh, Punjab, and NWFP, it is anticipated that DSP will only augment the technical \nand  budgetary  support  available  to  wider  provincial  public  sector  reforms,  whereas  it  is \nanticipated that Balochistan will rely more heavily on DSP support. \n \n35. \nThe  focus  on  intergovernmental  relations  includes  actions  in  respect  of  three  result \nareas:  (i)  enhanced  provincial  technical  support,  training,  and  mentoring  of  local  governments \n(principally  involving  departments  responsible  for  finance,  planning  and  development,  gender, \nand  local  government);  (ii)  reorientation  of  provincial  regulatory  relationships  with  local \ngovernments,  and  inter-local  government  relationships,  consistent  with  provisions  of  the  LGO \n(Local Government Commission [LGC], etc.); and (iii) intergovernmental fiscal transfers, through \nthe development of the provincial finance commissions (PFCs), to support performance-driven \nblock  grants  and  improve  systems  for  timely  and  predictable  transfers  encouraging  local \nrevenue  mobilization.  As  with  policy  outcome  1,  the  DSP  will  provide  support  to  provinces  to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nfully  articulate  the  technical,  regulatory,  and  fiscal  aspects  of  provincial-local  government \nrelationships in the framework of the provincial PRSP.24 \n \n\n3. \n\nLocal  Government  Institutions  Managing  Resources  Accountably  and \nEquitably \n\ninstitutionalizing \n\nfocusing  on  (i) \n\nlocal  government  planning,  budgeting, \n\n36. \nReforms under this policy outcome will support implementation of nationally sanctioned \nlocal government planning and fiscal management systems to create an enabling environment \nfor  efficient  and  equitable  delivery  of  services  according  to  clearly  established  norms  of  public \nparticipation,  access  to  information,  and  accountability.  Actions  will  be  supported  in  two  result \nareas \nfinance \nmanagement,  and  audit  systems;  and  (ii)  public  access,  accountability,  and  performance \nmanagement in local government.  \n \n37. \nUnder  the  first  result  area,  DSP  support  will  focus  on  the  appropriately  sequenced \nimplementation  of  federally  endorsed  and  provincially  promulgated  systems  for  revenue \nmobilization,  planning/budgeting,  accounting,  procurement  and  audit  (including  consistency  of \ninitiatives by NRB and the FD project, controller general of accounts/Project on Improvement of \nFinancial Reporting and Auditing and the auditor general). Balanced support will be provided for \nbuilding  capacities  of  both  administrative  and  political  organs  of  local  government.  Particular \nattention will be given to key systems and skills for improved service delivery (such as district \nhealth, education, and tehsil municipal services), and for increased performance with respect to \ngender and social development considerations. In concert with commitments under the PRSP, \nDSP  support  through  the  TA  loans  will  support  technical  studies  on  public-private  service \nprovision, locally appropriate service delivery databases, and interjurisdictional service delivery \narrangements  involving  cooperative  arrangements  across  local  governments.  Linkage  with \nPRSP  efforts  at  the  Federal  (policy  outcome  1)  and  province  (policy  outcome  2)  levels  to \ninstitute  poverty  reduction  strategies  as  an  integral  part  of  decentralized  systems  will  be \nhighlighted.  \n \n38. \nUnder  the  second  result  area,  DSP  support  will  focus  on  progressive  improvements  in \npublic access to information, the accountability of administrators and elected leaders to citizen \ninterests,  and  a  shift  towards  a  performance  orientation  in  key  aspects  of  local  government \nbusiness.  This  will  include  support  for  special  arrangements  for  monitoring  the  quality  and \nstandards of local government service delivery, nationwide application of a common social audit \nmethodology,25  and  administrative  grievance  and  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  in  local \ngovernment  including  a  district  ombudsman.  Community  social  audit  has  been  mandated  to \nNRB  and  the  proposed  Decentralization  Trust  for  Community  Empowerment.  As  with \nquantitative data systems, supported under result area 1, the qualitative information generated \nthrough  community  social  audits  will  establish  benchmarks  for  monitoring  trends  in  the \naccountability  and  responsiveness  of  elected  and  administrative  officials  and  support  shifts \ntowards  the  Government\u2019s  policy  ambition  of  open,  pro-poor,  accessible,  and  inclusive  local \ngovernment.  \n \n \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n24 Provincial PRSPs have been mandated by the Federal Government. These will be supported by the United Nations \nInternational Children's Emergency Fund and the World Bank. The DSP and, in the case of Punjab, the proposed \nResource Management Program (2003) will augment these resources where applicable.  \n\n25  Based  on  a  methodology  developed  by  Centro  Investigaci\u00f3n  de  Enfermedades  Tropicales  now  completed  in  10 \n\ndistricts and under way, in the first phase, in the remaining 87 districts. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n39. \nThe Program supports reform actions for which the Government has demonstrated clear \nand  sustained  commitment,  that  is,  the  creation  of  rule-based,  democratically  elected, \nappropriately resourced local governments operating according to clearly established norms of \npublic  participation,  access  to  information,  and  accountability.  However,  the  Program  has  five \nadditional  important  features  that  build  on  ADB\u2019s  key  role  in  support  for  decentralization  and \nrelated  reforms  in  support  of  poverty  reduction.  First,  it  is  one  of  two  key  core  governance \nreform investments by ADB that could favorably impact on the effectiveness of the majority of \nproposed lending under the CSP (Supplementary Appendix D), while building on a major ADB \nTA  activity  to  design  new  systems  for  decentralized  financing,  planning,  management,  and \ndelivery of local government services. These systems, and corresponding operational modules \nand  training  materials,  now  tested  and  approved,  are  ready  for  nationwide  implementation. \nSecond,  the  DSP  also  supports  the  extension  nationwide  of  reformed  Federal,  provincial,  and \nlocal  level  systems  for  accounting  and  independent  audit  through  a  combined  effort  with  the \nWorld  Bank.  Third,  the  Program  uniquely  combines  support  for  all  three  relations  of \naccountability  recognized  internationally  as  crucial  to  effective  devolved  governance.26  Fourth, \nthe  DSP  articulates  both  ADB's  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  gender  reforms  (i)  by \nembedding  gender  considerations  into  all  systems  and  procedures,  and  institutional  and \ncapacity  development  activities  supported  by  the  DSP;  and  (ii)  through  a  dedicated  TA  loan, \nentitled  Gender  and  Governance  Mainstreaming,  to  support  implementation  of  a  GRAP \nfollowing its approval by the Federal and province cabinets. Fifth, early indications are that the \nDSP may become an attractive modality for TA from bilateral agencies (e.g., DFID and CIDA).   \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n40. \nThe  Government  has  requested  two  loans,  one  of  $65  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF])  and  a  second  of  $205  million \nequivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan \n(the  Borrower).  These  loans  will  be  provided  to  support  the  DSP,  as  described  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix (Appendix 4). The resource costs of adjustment \n(see Appendix 6) are estimated to be about $462 million equivalent. Adjustment costs consist of \nthe following:  \n \n\nrestructuring  of  existing  institutions  and  creation  of  new  ones  at  the  Federal, \nprovincial, and local government levels; and \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building, \nequipment, and human resource development. \n\nincluding \n\ninfrastructure, \n\n \nThe  ADF  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  with  a  term  of  24 \n41. \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1% during the grace period \nand  1.5%  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n \n42. \nThe OCR loan of $205 million equivalent will have a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, and an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London Inter \n\n                                                 \n26 As commonly noted, these include (i) the downwards accountability of elected leaders to local constituencies, (ii) \ncomplementary  vertical  accountability  across  three  levels  of  government,  and  (iii)  the  establishment  of  effective \ninstitutional accountability between administrators and politicians. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nBank  Offered  Rate-based  lending  facility  (LBL),  including  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, a front end fee of 1% of the loan amount, and such other terms and conditions as are \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reason for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LBL facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and \n(ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in \nreliance upon any communication or advice from ADB.   \n \n43. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  two  tranches  upon \nsatisfactory compliance with an agreed upon number of eligible conditions from the date of loan \neffectiveness up to the loan closing date, which is 31 December 2006.  \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n44. \nExecuting  and  Implementing  Agencies.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  DSP,  including  for  the  Program  Loan,  and  the  two  TA  loans. \nImplementing agencies (IAs) will include, at the Federal level, the Pakistan Auditor General, the \nCGA,  NRB,  and  MWD,  and  the  provincial  governments.27  Appendix  7  charts  the  institutional \narrangements. \n \n45. \nCoordination  Bodies.  There  will  be  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC)  comprising \nrepresentatives of MOF, all IAs (Federal and provincial), and two representatives of civil society \norganizations (nominated through a process to be determined by MOF in consultation with NSC \nmembers during DSP inception. MWD will form a \"reference group\" for purposes of coordination \nand  oversight  of  implementation  of  the  TA2  loan  for  Gender  and  Governance  Mainstreaming. \nThe  chair  of  this  reference  group  will  be  a  member  of  the  DSP  provincial  steering  committee \n(PSC).  PSCs  will  also  be  established  in  each  province,  with  membership  determined  by  the \nprovinces  according  to  the  following  principles:  (i)  local  government  majority  membership;  (ii) \nequal  representation  of  elected  leaders  from  districts  and  tehsils;  (iii)  administrative  officers  to \nbe represented in PSCs in equal proportion to political members, with a predominance of district \nadministrative officers, but with adequate tehsil representation; (iv) local government members \nreflecting the range of strengths and weaknesses of local governments in the province; and (v) \ntwo  representatives  of  civil  society  organizations  active  in  the  province  with  a  track  record  of \nengagement  in  local  government  affairs  (e.g.,  support  to  local  elections,  local  government \ntraining,  service  delivery).  NSC  will  review  and  coordinate  the  overall  progress,  particularly  to \npromote  Federal-provincial  liaison  and  coordination  and  appropriate  civil  society  engagement. \nThis  will  take  place  in  May-June  every  year.  The  PSCs  will  be  empowered  to  approve \ninvestments at their level, and the provincial proposals will be sent to NSC only for consolidation \nand review for assessing legal compliance.  \n \n46. \nNSC  and  the  PSCs  will  be  assisted  by  program  support  offices  (PSOs)  at  the  Federal \nand  provincial  levels  operating  according  to  existing  government  regulations  and,  where \napplicable,  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures.  These  PSOs  (at  the  Federal  level  in  MOF  and \nMWD, and one in each provincial government) will be additionally supported by the TA loans, if \nrequired.  The  PSOs  will  be  staffed  by  (i)  employees  of  government  under  contract,  (ii) \ngovernment  establishment  staff,  and  (iii)  a  small  number  of  consultants  financed  by  grant  TA \n\n                                                 \n27 Province governments will assign lead agency responsibility to a particular department (e.g., finance, planning and \ndevelopment)  for  purposes  of  coordination  and  accountability  for  actions  within  the  provinces  jurisdiction.  This \ndecision will be reflected in the PCII (Planning Commission) required for program effectiveness.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n(Appendix  7).  The  institutional  location  and  structure  of  the  provincial  PSOs  will  capitalize  on \narrangements  that  may  already  be  in  place  to  support  existing  governance  reform  programs \n(e.g., for the Sindh and NWFP Structural Adjustment Credits, and the proposed ADB-supported \nPunjab  Resource  Management  Program).  The  Government  has  committed  to  initiating  the \nestablishment  and  staffing  of  the  PSOs  before  program  effectiveness.  The  full  capacity  of  the \nPSOs  will  therefore  be  achieved  by  FY2004.  As  featured  in  the  Policy  Matrix  and  policy \noutcome 3 result areas a key concern of the Program is to support improved intergovernmental \ndialogue,  public  access  to  information,  and  engagement  in  local  government  affairs.  Special \nassignments will be made in PSO job descriptions to complement this focus.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n47. \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries  (other  than  those  specified  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources)  (Appendix  8).  The  utilization  period  of  the  loan  will  be  48  months \ncommencing in December 2002 until December 2006.  \n \n48. \nDisbursement will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans, approved \nby ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998. Counterpart funds generated by the proceeds of the loans will \nbe used to provide budgetary support for decentralization. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nThe  PSO,  operating  out  of  MOF  for  the  TA  for  Local  Government  Performance \n49. \nEnhancement  (TA1)  and  MWD  for  the  TA  for  Gender  and  Governance  Mainstreaming  (TA2) \n(see Chapter V) managing annual plans and budgets approved by the PSCs, will be responsible \nfor all procurement and contract management, including contract clearances from ADB. At the \nprovincial level, the TA1 loan activities (para. 61) will be managed through the provincial PSOs, \nin the context of the DSP annual plan and budget, drawing resources from Federal assignment \naccounts.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Where firms are to be engaged, the quality-based selection method will be utilized \nfor consultant selection. \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  generated  by  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  used  to  provide \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n50. \nbudgetary support for decentralization. \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n51. \nThe Program Loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche, equivalent to $120 \nmillion  ($28.8  million  from  ADF  and  $91.2  million  from  OCR),  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness, based upon fulfillment of all first tranche conditions. A second tranche, equivalent \nto $150 million ($36 million equivalent from ADF and $114 million equivalent from OCR) will be \nreleased on compliance with the second tranche release conditions, and satisfactory completion \nof the June 2004 APR.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nThe first tranche release conditions are the following: \n\n52. \n \n\nThe  Federal  Government  will  enact  and  enforce  CGA  Ordinance  2001  and \nAuditor General Ordinance 2001, and the provinces will promulgate LGO 2001.     \n\nThe  Federal  Government  will  allocate  an  amount  to  the  provinces  and  local \ngovernments  equal  to  at  least  their  2.5%  share  of  the  GST  in  FY2003,  plus  an \nallocation  of  PRs1  billion  for  a  decentralization  transition  grant  in  the  FY2003 \nbudget. \n\nEach provincial government will establish an LGC. \n\nEach province will enact and enforce amendments in LGO 2001 for insertion of \nChapter  XII  and  XIIA,  which  provides  a  statutory  basis  for  a  technical  and \nindependent  provincial  finance  commission,  formula-based  transfers  to  local \ngovernments, and predictability and stability in the local fiscal environment. \n\n(v) \n\nThe Local Government Accounts Code will be approved by the Auditor General. \n\nThe Local Government Budget Code 2002 will be approved. \n\n(vi) \n \nThe second tranche release conditions are the following:  \n\n53. \n \n\nThe Federal Government will allocate in FY2004 an amount to the provinces and \nlocal governments equal to at least their share of the GST in accordance with the \nNFC decision in 2002. \n\nThe  GRAP  will  be  implemented  consistent  with  Federal  and  provincial  cabinet \napproval.  \n\nThe Federal Government and the provincial governments will create a regulatory \nframework,  including  amendments  to  laws  if  necessary,  to  enable  the  auditor \ngeneral  to  audit  local  governments  at  all  levels,  and  will  finalize  a  time-bound \nimplementation  plan  with  the  intention  that  the  auditor  general  is  capable  of \nauditing all levels of local government. \n\nEach  PFC  will  publish  an  annual  report  providing  information  about  the \nimplementation  of \ntransfer  outlays  (final \nexpenditures). \n\ntransfer  rules  and \n\nfiscal \n\nfiscal \n\nEach  province  will  notify  fiscal  transfer  rules  for  ensuring  transparency, \ntimeliness, predictability, and certification of fiscal transfers to local governments. \n\nEach  province  will  institute  performance-based  grants  and  matching  grants  for \npreferential  transfers  for  priority  policies  concerning  poverty,  gender,  and  local \nrevenue mobilization, to act as means of policy transmittal. \n\n(vii) \n\nEach provincial government will approve new financial rules for local government \ntogether with internal audit rules and procedures. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(viii)  The  Federal  Government  will  confirm,  through  its  revised  budget  estimates,  the \ntransfer of 2.5% additionality of the GST and decentralization transition grant to \nthe  provinces,  and,  through  provincial  revised  budget  estimates,  the  transfer  of \n2.5%  additionality  of  the  GST  to  the  local  governments  during  FY2003  within  a \nrange of 10% of the budgetary allocations. \n\nIn  accordance  with  the  agreement  reached  between  the  Federal  Government \nand  the  provinces,  community/social  audits  will  be  conducted  at  least  once  in \neach  district  to  assess  the  access  to  and  quality  of  services  in  key  social \nservices, including police, health, and education. \n\nThe  LGC  in  each  province  will  certify  that  a  majority  of  the  district  and  tehsil \ngovernments are acting substantially in accordance with the spirit of LGO Section \n114,  including  holding  of  public  hearings  by  accounts  committees,  display  of \naccounts  and  audit  reports  in  conspicuous  places,  and  provision  of  copies  to \nmedia agencies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nEach  province  will  certify  that  an  adequately  staffed  and  resourced  district \nombudsman has been appointed for each district and that the office of each such \nombudsman  has  published  at  least  one  annual  report  for  the  district  or  districts \nunder its jurisdiction. \n\n \n54. \nTo monitor implementation of the DSP, the Government will prepare quarterly progress \nreports and the annual performance review (APR) report for submission to ADB. MOF will also \nensure  publication  of  the  results  of  the  APR  through  its  website  and  other  media  as  agreed \nupon with ADB. ADB will send regular review missions and participate in the APR process. \n \n\n6. \n\nAuditing and Reporting \n\n55. \nEach IA will conduct internal audits. Annual external audits of each IA will be conducted \nby  the  auditor  general's  office  of  each  province  and  the  Federal  level  following  standard \nprocedures  or  by  a  competent  private  audit  firm  appointed  by  ADB  and  mutually  agreed  upon \nwith the auditor general. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the proceeds of the loans \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n56. \nThe  quarterly  progress  reports  and  the  results  of  the  APR  process  will  be  provided  to \nADB through the consolidated reports provided by PSO to NSC. The reports will be based on \nthe  annual  plan  and  will  describe  the  achievement  of  the  performance  measures  against  the \ntargets.  Financial  reports,  duly  verified  (pre-audit)  by  the  accountant  general's  office,  will  be \nprovided  from  implementing  agencies  to  MOF.  The  auditor  general's  office  will  conduct  an \nannual  audit.  Circulation  of  audit  reports  is  currently  restricted  to  the  agency  concerned; \nhowever, these reports should be available to the public through application of the forthcoming \nfreedom of information act. \n \n\n7. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe poverty impact of the DSP is to be monitored and evaluated through development of \nand linkage between two initiatives. First, the Government is currently developing a monitoring \nframework  for  the  PRSP,  including  finalization  of  intermediate  indicators  and  institutional \narrangements,  as  well  as  efforts  to  ensure  linkage  with  key  data-gathering  systems  including \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nsome  to  be  directly  supported  under  the  Program.28  In  tandem,  again  with  support  from  the \nDSP, the PRSP approach will be progressively extended from the province level to the district \ngovernment  level.  A  key  contribution  of  the  DSP  could  be  to  develop  governance  indicators \n(currently  underdeveloped  in  the  PRSP  monitoring  framework)  to  assist  the  Government  to \nmonitor  the  service  delivery  and  poverty  outcomes  of  decentralization.    This  assistance  will \ncomplement  efforts  under  TA2  to  ensure  articulation  of  gender  and  social  development \nconsiderations  in  local  government  planning,  budgeting,  and  expenditure  analysis,  including \nthrough expenditure and service delivery benchmarks.  \n \n58. \nSecond,  efforts  have  been  made  during  DSP  preparation  to  define  a  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  system  that  is  capable  of  tracking  national  and  provincial \nPRSP commitments at the local level and joining this to information generated through the APR \nprocess  (para.  59).  A  PME  system  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  is  intended  to  address  three \nrequirements  corresponding  to  the  three  policy  outcomes:  (i)  to  ensure  and  demonstrate \naccountable  use  of  public  resources;  (ii)  to  support  effective  management  of  institutional \narrangements made in light of new laws and regulations; and (iii) to progressively evaluate the \nimpact  of  the  reforms  (on  access,  equity,  affordability  of  services,  and  inclusive  political \nrepresentation) so as to provide tested lessons from experience on which to modify the policies, \nregulations,  and  institutional  arrangements  of  the  decentralization  and  gender  reforms.  The \nPME system, which will be further developed during inception, is based on two instruments: (i) \nthe program framework (Appendix 5) which outlines the key indicators against policy outcomes \nand  result  areas,  and  (ii)  the  thematic  areas  developed  for  TA1  and  to  be  included  in  TA2 \nfollowing  cabinet  approval  of  the  GRAP  (paras.  67-68).  All  investments  made  through  the  two \nTA loans in support of the reforms will be defined, monitored, and evaluated in the framework of \n11  thematic  areas  (para.  64).  Following  completion  and  approval  of  the  GRAP,  these  will  be \nupdated and thereafter will provide the structure for APRs (para. 57), the primary focus of the \nPME  system.  Whereas  each  thematic  area  will  highlight  cross-cutting  concerns  for  equity, \naccessibility,  and  affordability  criteria,  it  is  not  the  purpose  of  the  PME  system  to  evaluate \npoverty  outcomes  directly.  However,  the  dual  PME  focus,  at  the  higher  level  on  PRSP \nframeworks,  and  at  the  operational  level  on  policy  outcome  monitoring,  potentially  offers  the \nbest  opportunity  to  test  the  underlying  assumption  of  the  reforms,  namely,  the  association \nbetween decentralized governance and poverty reduction. \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\n59. \nAnnual  Performance  Review.  A  key  feature  of  program  management  will  be  APRs \nconvened  by  the  respective  steering  committees  during  June  of  2004  and  2005.  The  APR  is \nintended to promote policy dialogue among key stakeholders and to ensure that the assistance \navailable  under  the  DSP  is  well  tailored  to  the  requirements  of  the  IAs.  The  APR  process  will \nbuild  on  and  provide  added  incentive  for  existing  procedures  for  monitoring  and  compliance \nverification within the Government, which requires periodic progress reporting and annual audit \nprocedures.  The  2004  APR  process  will  (i)  assess  progress  toward  compliance  with  second \ntranche  conditions  for  the  Program  Loan;  (ii)  assess  progress  with  implementation  of \ncomplementary  activities  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  (including  implementing \nagencies at Federal and provincial levels) and ADB and as may be supported by the TA loans \nand external grant financing; and (iii) define requirements for adjustments to activities supported \n                                                 \n28  These  include  the  Centro  Investigacion  de  Enfermedades  Tropicales  community  social  audit,  a  proposed  core \nwelfare  indicators  cluster  survey,  and  Federal  and  provincial  bureaus  of  statistics  survey  systems.  Efforts  will  be \nmade  to  link  with  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework.  Overseas  Development  Institute.  2002.  Developing  a \nMonitoring  Framework  for  the  PRSP.

Developing a Monitoring Framework for the Interim PRSP. 24 July 2002.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nby the TA loans in the forthcoming FY. The review will occur through a publicized, participatory \nprocess beginning at the district level during May each year as mutually agreed upon between \nthe  Government  and  ADB,  just  prior  to  the  new  FY,  to  enable  Federal,  provincial,  and  district \nauthorities, with input by civil society, to reflect the results, where appropriate, in their statutory \nplanning  and  budgeting  process.  A  satisfactory  conclusion  to  the  APR  process  on  the \ncomplementary  activities  will  be  a  condition  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the  Program \nLoan.  APRs  will  therefore  provide  an  opportunity  to  review,  modify,  or  add  complementary \nactivities to support the DSP.  \n \n60. \nThe detailed scope of the APR will be finalized during inception of the DSP based on the \npolicy  outcomes,  result  areas,  and  thematic  areas,  respectively,  and  indicators  proposed  for \npolicy dialogue during the May-June 2004 APR (Supplementary Appendix F, Chart 1).  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOANS \n\nfinancing  and \n\nthe  objectives,  scope, \n\n61. \nTo augment the capacity for implementation and sustainability of the reform agenda, TA \nfor institution strengthening and capacity development will be provided through two TA loans: (i) \nLocal  Government  Performance  Enhancement  (TA1);  and  (ii)  Gender  and  Governance \nMainstreaming  (TA2).  Details  on \nimplementation \narrangements are provided in Appendixes 9 and 10. Provincial and local governments will not \nincur  cost  liabilities  for  the  TA  loans.  Provincial  and  local  governments'  access  to  technical \nsupport  financed  by  the  TA  loans  will  be  determined  according  to  (i)  a  sharing  formula \napproximating  the  NFC  formula,  and  (ii)  their  subsequent  performance  in  the  efficient  and \neffective implementation of agreed upon activities as judged through the APR process.  \n \n62. \nTA1:  Local  Government  Performance  Enhancement.  This  TA  loan  will  be  executed \nby  MOF  and  implemented  by  both  Federal  and  provincial  agencies.  The  reforms  supported \nunder the DSP will require a series of ongoing actions and initiatives to articulate the legal and \npolicy framework established so far by the Government into intergovernmental institutional and \nfiscal  arrangements,  which  must  necessarily  be  updated  and  refined  during  the  course  of \nimplementation. In addition, fundamental issues of human resource capacity and development \nwill need to be addressed in an uncertain, changing environment. Work will also be necessary \nto  design  a  client-responsive,  participatory  process  for  defining  capacity-building  requirements \nover the life of the DSP.  \n \n63. \nTo  be  effective,  support  under  the  DSP  must  be  attuned  to  two  realities  of  policy \nreforms: first, that policy decisions are necessarily taken with incomplete knowledge of existing \ncircumstances  and  their  interrelationships;  and  second,  that  policy  interventions  will  have \nunintended  consequences.  This  second  point  is  particularly  marked  given  the  very  diverse \nsituations  of  local  governments  across  the  four  provinces.  Hence  TA1  will  follow  a  phased \napproach to ensure maximum adaptability to changing circumstances.  \n \n64. \nTA1  will  be  implemented  in  phases  over  4  years,  with  expenditure  commencing  at  the \nstart of FY2004. TA1 will be organized around 11 themes considered necessary to articulate the \nnew legal, fiscal, and institutional arrangements of decentralization (see Appendix 9 for thematic \nareas). These themes are outlined, along with examples of activities to be pursued in the first \nphase  (covering  12  months  from  TA1  effectiveness)  in  Appendix  9,  Table  A9.1.  These  will  be \nreviewed  and  finalized  during  the  program  inception  phase  to  ensure  that  they  meet  the \nrequirements  of  the  Executing  Agencies  and  IAs.  In  this  manner  the  final  list  of  prioritised \nactivities will be formulated and approved in June 2003. This process will be repeated each year \nin  the  month  of  May  as  part  of  the  APR,  culminating  in  approval  in  June.  Not  later  than  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\npenultimate month of phase 1, the Government and ADB will, as part of the APR process (para. \n59): (i) review progress in implementing the activities supported under Phase 1; and (ii) define \nthe  terms  of  reference  for  Phase  II,  which  will  continue  from  month  13  to  month  24  of  the  TA \nloan.  Thereafter,  not  later  than  the  penultimate  month  of  Phase  II,  the  parties  will  repeat  this \nprocess  and  develop  the  corresponding  terms  of  reference  for  Phase  III  (months  25-36).  The \nprocess will be repeated for Phase IV. Efficiency and effectiveness of the capacity development \nexpenditures will be assessed as part of the APR every year. Other inputs will come from social \naudit,  special  purpose  research,  and  learning  supported  by  TA  grant  and  other  external \nfinancing. \n \n65. \nAn indicative planning figure will be derived for each IA, in accordance with the sharing \narrangements  agreed  upon  in  the  official  government  approvals  for  TA1  activities.  Of  the  total \nTA1  resources,  30%  will  be  allocated  to  the  Federal  IAs  and  70%  to  the  provinces.    Annual \nworkplans and budgets will be presented to the PSCs and NSC. NSC will review PSC approvals \nto  ensure  appropriate  consolidation  and  legal  compliance.  The  process  will  be  repeated  for \nPhase II, beginning with communication of indicative planning figures (IPFs) to IAs in February \n2004.  The  APR  will  take  place  in  May  2004  and  will  provide  reviews  for  second  annual  work \nplan, which will be approved in June 2004. The process will similarly continue for the following \nphases.  Accessing resources, at least to a certain extent, will be on a competitive basis. This \nwill use performance evaluation and incentives for allocating preferential amounts to those IAs \nand local governments that make better use of the TA opportunities. \n \n66. \nIn addition to investments prioritized directly by the IAs, during the first phase, NSC will \ndirect  that  the  following  special  purpose  policy  studies  be  undertaken29:  (i)  accounting  and \ninformation management architectures for local governments in tandem with preparation of the \nWorld  Bank-supported  Project  for  Strengthening  Accounting  and  Report;  (ii)  preparation  of  a \nhuman  resource  strategy  for  development  of  provincial  and  local  government  accounting \ncapacity to take over responsibilities from the CGA in accordance with constitutional principles, \nwithout  compromising  accounting  standards;  and  (iii)  private  provision  and  production  of \nmandated  local  government  services  to  identify  good  practice  models  for  local  government \nengagement with private service providers. \n \nTA2: Gender and Governance Mainstreaming. While a key purpose of the program is \n67. \nto  support  mainstreaming  of  gender  and  social  development  considerations  in  all  aspects  of \nlocal government affairs, it is apparent that prevailing conditions in Pakistan require that these \nefforts  be  augmented  by  targeted  interventions.  These  interventions  are  currently  being \nprepared with support from the ADB Gender Reform TA grant (footnote 18). To ensure political \nbuy-in  by  elected  representatives,  these  interventions  will  be  consolidated  into  gender  reform \naction  plans.  Approval  by  Federal  and  provincial  cabinets  of  the  GRAP,  in  accordance  with \nagreements already made under TA 3832, will be a condition for effectiveness of TA2. TA2 will \nbe  executed  by  MOF  and  implemented  by  MWD  at  the  Federal  level,  and  by  corresponding \nwomen\u2019s  development  departments  at  provincial  level.  It  will  support  implementation  of  the \nGRAP, which the Government is preparing with support from TA 3832. \n \nThe GRAP is expected to have been prepared by December 2002. It will be organized \n68. \naround  four  central  themes,  each  of  critical  importance  to  the  success  of  the  program:  (i) \nimproving women\u2019s representation and participation in political and administrative structures; (ii) \nencouraging  a  policy  shift  from  social  welfare  to  social  development,  and  from  women\u2019s \ndevelopment  to  gender  equality;  (iii)  restructuring  of  institutions  (particularly  at  local  level)  and \n\n                                                 \n29 Some of these studies may be supported through grant cofinancing by DFID.  \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nprocedures dealing with gender and social development issues; and (iv) engendering planning \nand  budgetary  processes  with  the  aim  of  narrowing  the  gender  gap  in  public  expenditure  and \nservice  provision,  again  with  a  focus  on  local  service  delivery  outcomes.  Like  TA1,  it  is \nanticipated  that  TA2  implementation  will  also  be  phased,  modalities  for  which  will  be \nincorporated in the GRAP. \n \n69. \nThe total cost of the two TA loans is estimated to be $30 million, including $23 million for \nTA1 and $7 million for TA2. ADB will finance all foreign exchange costs and up to $21.1 million \nequivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide  two  loans  equivalent  to  SDR  22,664,000 \nmillion  [$30  million  equivalent]  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  maturity  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the TA Loan Agreements. Consulting services \nmay  be  provided  by  one  or  more  consulting  firms  or  individual  consultants  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nOverall Program Benefits \n\nA. \n \n70. \nDSP will support reforms to reorganize state structures and fiscal sharing arrangements, \ndecentralize  delivery  of  basic  services  and;  improve  accountability  of  public  officials,  both \npolitical and administrative, by (i) providing budget support to enable the Federal Government to \nbear  the  costs  associated  with  intergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring,  thereby  underwriting \npredictable,  timely  and  transparent  transfers  to  local  governments;  (ii)  providing  capacity \nbuilding  to  clarify  and  make  functional  the  necessary  rules  and  regulations  for  improved \nintergovernmental coordination of programs and services; (iii) helping to sustain local autonomy \nby  supporting  improved  fiscal  information,  policy  analysis,  and  training  systems  to  improve \nmanagement decision-making; (iv) encouraging citizen engagement in planning and monitoring \nservice  delivery  and  increased  access  to  information  about  local  government  affairs;  and  (v) \nsupporting  a  nationwide  communications,  strategic  monitoring,  and  social  audit  process  to \nsystematically and publicly communicate and monitor the implementation of decentralization in \nthe context of PRSP commitments.  \n \nB. \n \n71. \nThe  architects  of  Pakistan\u2019s  ambitious  decentralization  reforms  are  aware  of  the  policy \npresumption  that  decentralization  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  pro-poor \noutcomes  in  any  country.  They  are  also  aware  that  these  reforms  will  be  implemented  in \nunusually diverse local conditions and in a future likely to be as changeable as the past. Further, \nthe  Government  is  aware  that  the  reforms  are  by  no  means  fully  joined  up  and  that  key \nelements  of  the  strategy  remain  neither  fully  defined  nor  time-bound.  However,  the  policy  on \ndecentralization  and  poverty  reduction  contains  a  clear  step-wise  logic,  namely  that  for \ndecentralization  to  have  significant  poverty-reducing  impacts  an  enabling  environment  must \nhave  certain  features.  It  is  at  least  necessary  that  (i)  the  assignment  of  functions  to  local \ngovernments must be clear, reflect subsidiarity principles, and be supported and appropriately \nregulated  by  higher  authorities;  (ii)  intra-local  government  relations  and  relations  between \nadministrative  officials  and  elected  leaders  must  be  clear  and  robustly  practiced;  (iii)  leaders \nmust  be  resourced,  and  have  sufficient  fiscal  space,  to  respond  to  empowered  constituencies \nwith services; and (iv) norms must be defined to create administrative and political incentives for \n\nProgrammatic Impacts \n\n \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\ngood performance, and sanctions directly enforced for malfeasance. Consistent with this step-\nwise  logic,  the  program  intends  to  impact  on  each  of  these  enabling  conditions  for  poverty \nreduction.  \n\n  \n\nIntergovernmental Assignments. DSP support will positively impact intergovernmental \n72. \nrelations  by  (i)  assisting  implementation  of  newly  defined  assignments  of  function  among \nFederal,  provincial,  and  local  governments,  with  a  particular  focus  on  local  government \nrepresentation  and  service  delivery;  (ii)  supporting  timely,  predictable,  and  transparent \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers for local governments; and (ii) assisting in the reorientation of \nprovincial  authorities  from  a  \"command  and  control\"  ethos  to  a  new  set  of  policy  support, \nmentoring, regulatory, and adjudicative functions. An enabling environment for sufficient linkage \nbetween decentralization and poverty reduction will not be created in the absence of these three \npre-requisites.  \n \n73. \nLocal  Government  Support  Systems.  Conflicts  have  already  arisen  between  sector \nexperts  in  group  offices  and  central  services  such  as  planning,  procurement,  accounting,  and \nbudgeting departments. Management, coordination and information control practices discourage \nrapid  and  efficient  service  results.  The  systems  are  still  rule-bound  and  rigid,  delaying  actions \nand increasing frustration among political officials. DSP benefits will be evident in (i) improved \nmanagement  support  systems  that  focus  on  the  performance  results  of  these  systems,  (ii) \nimplementation  of  basic  systems  and  procedures  for  core  fiscal  planning  and  administrative \nsystems,  and  (iii)  actions  to  pave  the  way  for  installation  of  new  systems  (e.g.,  Project  on \nImprovement  of  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing)  consistently  with  the  absorptive  capacities \nand  technical  abilities  of  local  officials.  The  DSP  will  also  provide  support  for  institutionalized \ntraining  systems  using  modern  pedagogical  techniques  and  alternative  suppliers  of  modules \nand materials. This benefit is essential for the sustainability of local decision capacity to operate \nmanagement support systems. \n \nIntra-Local Government Relations. The DSP will positively impact the critical issue of \n74. \nintra-local  government  relations.  It  will  assist  in  clarifying  and  building  capacities  for  effective \nfiscal, political, and administrative relationships between local government tiers. In particular, it \nwill  (i)  clarify  fiscal  relationships  and  set  transfer  formulas;  (ii)  establish  equitable  rules  and \nbusiness procedures for regular contact among district, tehsil, and union administrative officials \n(e.g.,  District  Council  Officer,  Tehsil  Municipal  Officer,  and  Secretary  of  Union  Council)  and \nbetween  elected  leaders;  and  (iii)  support  the  effective  functioning  of  LGCs  and  musharavit \ncommittees  (inter  and  intra  governmental  dispute  resolution)  for  the  resolution  of  disputes \naccording to established norms and legality controls.  \n \n75. \nPolitical/Administrative  Accountability  Relations.  Newly  elected  members  cannot \ninstinctively  make  proper  decisions  on  services,  projects,  and  citizen  representation.  Nor  can \nnewly  elected  nazims  instantly  develop  sound,  harmonious  relations  with  their  councils, \nespecially with new women members. Needed are clear sets of rules to guide decision making \non a wide range of issues, understandable to many officials who are illiterate. The DSP will help \ndevelop council members\u2019 skills in (i) voting decision rules; (ii) leadership, coalition building, and \nmanagement  of  council  meetings;  (iii)  sector  oversight/monitoring  committees,  e.g.,  health, \npolice,  tax  administration;  (iv)  budget  analysis  and  approval  of  both  development  and  current \nbudgets;  and  (v)  community/constituency  mobilization.  The  benefits  of  improved  executive-\nlegislative  relationships  through  DSP  support  will  lead  to  improved  services  and  projects  and \nbetter gender relations in the governance process. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nin \n\n(i) \nCitizen-State  Accountability  Relations.  DSP  benefits  will  be  evident \n76. \nstrengthened requirements and incentives for responsiveness by district governments to citizen \nservice preferences through support for active council monitoring committees; (ii) measures to \nincrease accountability of local officials, such as clarification of rules governing public inputs into \nplanning  and  budgeting  processes  as  well  as  citizen  and  social  audit  institutions  to  evaluate \nservices  and  project  results;  (iii)  improved  bottom-up  participation  through  support  for  the \nestablishment  of  and  participation  by  CCBs  for  advocacy  of  development  projects;  (iv)  more \nsustainable  local  institutions  as  a  result  of  improved  administrative  capacities,  authority,  and \nincentives  to  respond  to  local  demands  in  order  to  prevent  officials  from  being  overwhelmed \nwith new demands for services they cannot meet; (v) increased local resource mobilization, thus \nunderwriting greater accountability of local leaders; (vi) better capacities among local leaders for \npublic  consultation,  through  support  for  training  of  elected  and  appointed  officials  in  how  to \nconduct  public  hearings  and  respond  to  the  public  on  key  issues;  and  (vii)  implementation  of \nstatutory arrangements for the resolution of disputes brought by citizens against public officials, \nsuch as internal grievance procedures and district ombudsmen.  \n\n \nGender Equality. Gender issues cut across each of the enabling conditions addressed \n77. \nby the DSP. There are major gender disparities in public sector employment including the civil \nservice,  and  women\u2019s  exclusion  from  governance  structures  will  be  both  a  focus  of  targeted \ninterventions (through the GRAPs) and mainstreamed through administrative procedures. Past \nefforts  at  gender  awareness  and  stand-alone  women\u2019s  empowerment  and  service  delivery \ninterventions  have  failed  and  will  continue  to  fail  in  the  absence  of  efforts,  supported  by  the \nprogram,  to  (i)  address  disparities  in  the  civil  service;  (ii)  capitalize  on  the  new  political  space \navailable to women through political representation; (iii) provide support through the insertion of \nappropriate  and  sustainable  gender  considerations  into  every  aspect  of  local  planning, \nbudgeting,  expenditure,  and  service  delivery  analysis,  including  all  capacity  building,  public \neducation, and monitoring and evaluation activities; and (iv) ensure that gender-disaggregated \nand  monitorable  benchmarks  of  performance  are  created  and  debated  through  each  of  the \nabove.   \n \n78. \nIncentives and Sanctions. Within the constraints of local political economy and history, \nthe alignment of incentives and sanctions impacts directly on the efficiency and effectiveness of \nlocal government performance and, through this, on pro-poor service delivery. As with issues of \ngender,  the  program\u2019s  impact  on  incentives  and  sanctions  will  cut  across  each  of  the  above \nbenefits  (paras.  72-77),  albeit  in  varying  degrees.  The  primary  impact  will  occur  through  (i) \nnationwide  implementation  of  a  common  accounting  system,  and  corresponding  capacity  for \nreports  before  elected \nexternal  audit; \nrepresentatives;  (iii)  public  access  to  the  deliberations  of  mandatory  public  accounts \ncommittees; (iv) improved capacity of, and public access to council monitoring committees; (v) \nfiscal  and  administrative  measures  to  better  enable  elected  leaders  to  address  priorities  and \ngrievances raised by citizens; (vi) official adjudication of disputes through the local ombudsman \nsystem; (vii) fiscal transfer systems that direct resources to underserved and poorer sections of \nthe population; and (viii) nationwide extension of community social audit procedures and service \ndelivery databases to improve the accountability of officials at the Federal, provincial, and local \nlevels for their commitments to the poverty reduction strategy.  \n\n(ii)  mandatory  presentation  of  external  audit \n\n \nProgram Risks  \n\nC. \n \nThe  risks  facing  the  reform  process  are  formidable.  Despite  the  unprecedented \n79. \nopportunities  presented  by  the  Government's  commitments  to  decentralization  and  gender \nempowerment,  the  historical  legacy  of  numerous  failed  attempts  to  affect  lasting  changes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\ncannot  be  ignored.  Resistance  and  noncompliance  with  the  spirit  and  letter  of  the  reform \nprocess are likely, and unless the structure of incentives and sanctions on public performance \nare  transformed,  entrenched  institutional  practices,  in  politics  as  in  administrative  practice,  will \nensure  that  patronage  systems  continue  to  flout  the  law.  There  are  risks  of  \"context\"  \u2013  macro \nrisks  \u2013  and  risks  particularly  associated  with  decentralization  \u2013  micro  risks.  The  macro  risks \naffecting  the  DSP  are  well  known  \u2013  political,  economic,  and  social  \u2013  and  these  may  greatly \nexacerbate the impact of the many unintended consequences of decentralization. First, political \ninstability  derived  from  either  border  conflict  with  India  or  destabilization  of  the  regime  by \nopponents of the US-led war on terrorism could undermine national support for decentralization, \ncause  redirection  of  fiscal  resources,  and  undermine  the  key  principle  of  predictability  and \ntimeliness  in  fiscal  transfers.  Second,  the  uncertain  political  climate  is  generating  longer  term \neconomic  costs  in  lost  revenues  from  trade,  tourism,  international  communications,  and \ninvestment.  The  risks  are  that  social  unrest  owing  to  loss  of  safety  nets,  jobs,  and  health \nservices  could  turn  the  population  against  the  Government,  and  against  its  newest  local \nrepresentatives  that  have  the  fewest  means  at  their  disposal  to  correct  macroeconomic \nproblems. Third, the patterns of exclusion and disempowerment facing women in Pakistan are \ndeeply bound into cultural and political traditions, reinforced by profound inequalities in literacy \nand  assets.  While  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  women\u2019s  political  representation  is \nunprecedented, rapid change in on-ground realities cannot be expected, which may weaken the \ncommitment to the reforms of the largest disadvantaged population in Pakistan.   \n \n80. \nThere  are  three  micro  risks.  First,  Pakistan  has  only  marginal  experience  with  local \npolitics, consensus building, and public accountability of leaders. The highest political authority, \nthat is, nazims, at all three tiers of local government belong to the local elite. Unless councilors \nare able to organize there is a risk that government institutions will continue to be manipulated \nto protect elite interests. Further, local conflicts could release violent passions and unintended \nconsequences for local development. Political education efforts may not occur quickly enough to \nprevent  wider  chaos  from  taking  hold  of  local  governance.  Second,  most  local  officials  lack \ncapacity to perform the many new roles assigned them, from managing educational services to \npreparing development budgets. Capacity building may not lead to skills, or worse still, may end \nup as more unused skills of little use in fulfilling duties in unchallenging official roles. The skills \nmay not translate into better decisions. Third, underlying administrative systems are lacking to \nperform such basic functions as procuring equipment, accounting for the order and its delivery, \ncommitting budget resources for the order over the course of a FY, and evaluating the value for \nmoney of the purchase. Important systems for internal audit and expenditure management are \nweak  or  missing  in  many  districts,  which  could  result  in  major  loss  of  or  diversion  of  public \nfunds.  This  means  that  DSP  funds  might  not  be  spent  because  of  poor  absorptive  capacity \nand/or  red  tape  problems.  DSP  efforts  to  rationalize  the  design  and  installation  of  multiple \nmanagement  support  systems,  even  with  the  support  of  other  externally  funded  projects,  may \nnot  be  sufficient  to  produce  results.  Key  features  of  the  DSP  include  mitigating  measures  for \neach  of  these  risks,  including  (i)  the  dual  focus  on  political  and  administrative  capacity \ndevelopment;  (ii)  the  incorporation  of  training  and  skill  development  in  a  wider  framework  of \nsystems, procedures, sanctions, and incentives; (iii) the focus on core administrative and fiscal \nmanagement  systems  and  competencies  necessary  for  more  efficient  and  accountable \nutilization  of  resources;  and  (iv)  encouragement  of  multidonor  commitments  to  common \naccountability, resource allocation, and policy dialogue procedures under the DSP.  \n  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n81. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the DSP Loan Agreement: \n \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan

\n\nconsultants. \n\n \nIn  addition,  the  loan  documents  will  include  a  covenant  that  ADB  will  have  the  right  to \n83. \nsuspend the Program loan in case there is inadequate progress in the implementation of the TA \nloans or vice versa. \n \n\nVIII. \n\n RECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  Program  loan,  and  technical  assistance  loans  would \ncomply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the \nfollowing for the Decentralization Support Program in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan:  \n \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nloan  of  $205,000,000 \n\nIslamic  Republic  of  Pakistan \n\na \nthe \nDecentralization  Support  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; \na term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n\nfor \n\na  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR) \n49,107,000  (equivalent  to  $65,000,000)  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for \nthe  Decentralization  Support  Program  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24  \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; \n\na loan of SDR 17,376,000 (equivalent to $23,000,000) to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan  for  technical  assistance  for  the  Local  Government  Performance \nEnhancement  TA  loan,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the

\n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n1. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n1. \nThe  relationship  between  governance  reforms  and  poverty  reduction  is  central  to  the \nstrategy  developed  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  This  is  evident  in  the  Interim  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  Paper  and  in  the  overarching  rationale  for  decentralization,  which  focuses \non  poverty  reduction  through  improved  service  delivery  (access,  equity,  affordability)  and \nimproved  political  representation  (accountability,  transparency,  responsiveness).  The  nexus \nbetween  governance  and  poverty  reduction  is  also  a  key  feature  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  Country  Poverty  Analysis  (CPA).  Similarly,  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program \n(CSP)  (2002-2005)  highlights  governance  reform,  and  decentralization  within  that,  as  the  core \nfeature of the strategy for poverty reduction. Both the CPA and CSP have been framed in the \ncontext of the full PRSP and ongoing efforts to create a feasible monitoring framework linked to \nthe budget and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).1 \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Analysis: Poverty and Governance \n\n2. \nPoverty in Pakistan exhibits six features of direct relevance to a governance support and \npoverty  reduction  program  such  as  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP).  First,  income \ndistribution is relatively equal compared with countries of similar income level, which suggests \nboth  that  generalized  benefits  may  be  obtained  from  pro-poor  interventions  and  that \nnonspecifically targeted interventions will tend to benefit rather than exclude the poor. Second, \nalthough  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  high,  transitory  poverty  rates  are  also  high.  This  implies \nthat,  rather  than  focusing  on  the  symptoms  of  poverty,  such  as  income  gap  or  social  sector \nindicators, it is important to focus on the probable causes of entry and exit into poverty, that is, \nvulnerability to poverty. The poverty rationale for the DSP is in large measure supported by the \nevident role of the state, especially the local state, in exacerbating the conditions of vulnerability. \nThird,  a  large  proportion  of  the  poor  are  dependent  on  informal  sector  wage  labor  and  are \ntherefore particularly vulnerable to rent seeking by local public officials responsible for regulating \ntheir  livelihood  activities.  The  fourth  and  fifth  features  of  poverty  provide  further  focus  on  the \nvulnerability/governance  nexus.  While  relatively  egalitarian  in  terms  of  \u201cincome  poverty,\u201d  the \ncapacity of the poor to access public entitlements\u2013like political processes or goods and services \nthat  determine  human  development\u2013contrasts  strikingly  with  that  of  the  rich.  For  instance, \nliteracy,  which  is  critically  important  in  awareness  of  and  access  to  entitlements,  is  highly \nunequal.  There  are  tremendous  disparities  in  human  development  (defined  as  enlarging \npeople's choices in a way that enables them to lead longer, healthier, and fuller lives). Finally, \nand  not  least  important,  a  sixth  feature  stands  out  in  the  poor's  perceptions  of  poverty:  they \nhighlight  increasing  insecurity  and  vulnerability  arising  from  sectarian  violence,  declining  law \nand order, and the unresponsiveness of state officials to their needs and interests. \n \nGovernance  in  public  institutions  indeed  strongly  influences  whether  from  the  poor's \n3. \nviewpoint a state is \u201cdevelopmental\u201d or \u201cpredatory,\u201d a key theme in the DSP.2 First, while poverty \nmanifests  as  material  deprivation\u2013hunger;  lack  of  food,  shelter,  and  clothing\u2013the  poor  also \n                                                 \n1  Overseas  Development  Institute.  2002.

Developing  a \nMonitoring Framework for the Interim PRSP. 24 July 2002. \n\n2 This is evident in results of the participatory poverty assessment, recently concluded in Pakistan.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nhighlight  common  psychological  and  political  dimensions  to  poverty\u2013lack  of  power  and  voice; \nfeelings of dependency, shame, and humiliation. Poor people highlight lack of access to basic \ninfrastructure  and  services.  But  whereas  official  accounts  of  poverty  highlight  the  difference \nbetween rich and poor in indicators of educational, health, or other standards of attainment, the \npoor  rarely  have  such  a  static  view  of  what  is  required  in  their  lives.  Lack  of  access  to \naffordable,  effective  health  care  is  dreaded  for  instance,  not  just  as  a  source  of  ill  health, \nimportant  though  that  is,  but  as  a  source  of  vulnerability  and,  ultimately,  destitution.  Finally, \nwhile  the  poor  are  concerned  about  lack  of  income,  they  frequently  attribute  this  to  the \ninstitutional  constraints  they  face  in  managing  their  assets  (human,  material,  social,  political), \nthrough which they cope with their vulnerability.  \n \n4. \nSecond,  most  poor  people  recognize  that  the  state  has  responsibilities  to  provide \naffordable,  effective,  and  equitable  public  goods  and  services.  They  feel  the  government  has \nfailed to deliver and that their interactions with local state institutions are marked by rudeness, \nhumiliation,  harassment,  and  corruption.  The  poor  often  perceive  their  interactions  with  these \nagencies  as  increasing  their  vulnerability  to  erosion  of  important  household,  political,  civil, \nnatural  resource,  and  social  assets.  The  impact  of  a  corrupt  tax  official,  a  brutalizing  police \nforce, or a compromised judiciary is remarked by the poor far more often than is attended to in \nofficial accounts of indicators and causes of poverty, which tend often to focus, for instance, on \naccess to health or education.3  \n \n5. \nThe  vulnerable  poor  in  Pakistan  are  especially  affected  by  their  relations  with  a \ndysfunctional  and  predatory  local  state.  Vulnerability  is  exacerbated  by  the  everyday \nharassment, underperformance, exclusion, and denial of basic rights by public officials of people \nwho  are  disadvantaged  by  virtue  of  gender,  ethnicity,  or  economic  or  political  power.  This \nsource of vulnerability, directly impacted by the performance of local governments, is marked in \nthree aspects of the lives of the poor: (i) by actions of local officials responsible for licensing and \nregulating economic activities, who typically extract rent from informal sector workers; (ii) by the \ncorruption of local cadre/officials, which hampers access to public goods and services \u2013 health, \neducation,  land  management, etc.;  and (iii) by the failure of government institutions to provide \nlaw and order and security, the primary enabling condition of pro-poor development.  \n \n\n3. \n\nParticipation Process \n\na. \n\nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \n\nStakeholders  at  all  three  levels  of  government  and  civil  society  have  been  actively \n6. \ninvolved  in  the  design  of  the  DSP  through  the  program  preparation  process  and  through  the \nthree  related  technical  assistance  (TA)  activities.4  Since  May  2001  under  the  TA  for  Fiscal \nDecentralization (FD), consultations have occurred with provincial and local government officials \nand  elected  representatives.  The  TA  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Government-NGO \nCooperation  (TA  3618),  begun  in  March  2002,  has  established  a  process  of  dialogue  with \n\n                                                 \n3  Although  only  recently  initiated,  participatory  poverty  research  in  Pakistan  \u2013  by  the  Centro  Investigacion  de \nEnfermedades  Tropicales  (CIET)/National  Reconstruction  Bureau  (NRB)  and  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) supported Participatory Poverty Assessment, highlights this point. Under a CIET/NRB survey \nof over 10,000 respondents (CIET. 2001: 'Community Monitoring of public services and human rights - summaries' \ndraft results), 52-60% of respondents were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with police services compared with 38-\n40% with the courts, 28% with government health services, and around 15% with primary education. \n\n4   ADB.  2000.

Informal,  though  focused,  consultations  occurred  with  selected \nNGO representatives during this process.    A  similar  but  more  intensive  round  of  discussions \nwas  held  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission;  in  each  province  understandings  reached  were \nrecorded  through  province-specific  \"aides  memoire\"  outlining  key  issues  raised  during  the \nstakeholder consultation process. The fact-finding concluded with a multistakeholder workshop \nin  Islamabad  at  which  key  aspects  of  the  DSP  \u2013  the  policy  matrix,  financing  and  institutional \narrangements,  TA  loan  structure  and  outstanding  matters  for  resolution  \u2013  were  extensively \ndiscussed prior to the formal wrap-up meeting chaired by the Ministry of Finance. The Appraisal \nMission  held  discussions  with  the  Joint  Working  Group5  (comprising  NGO  and  Government \nrepresentatives), and likewise concluded with a multistakeholder review workshop.  \n \n\nb. \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\n8. \nThe DSP participation strategy has two aspects. First, participation is a central tenant of \nthe  Government's  governance  reforms,  and  is  highlighted  in  the  institutional  structures  and \nsystems  promulgated  in  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  (LGO)  of  2001.  This  is  a  unique \ndeparture  from  previous  practice  in  Pakistan  and  presents  an  historic  opportunity  to  develop \ncapacities of the representative political and administrative structures to implement participatory \ngovernance  processes  that  have  a  direct  poverty  reduction  focus.  The  DSP  participation \nstrategy  is  therefore  integral  to  the  reforms  it  is  designed  to  support.  The  DSP  is  specifically \ndesigned to support the operationalization of citizen\u2013state participatory arrangements through (i) \nensuring that both the systems and procedures provide for citizen accessibility, accountability,6 \nand  transparency;  and  (ii)  devoting  considerable  resources  to  developing  the  capacities  of \ncitizens,  elected  representatives,  and  local  government  administrators  to  enact  their  functions \nand responsibilities consistent with the participatory spirit of the governing legislation. \n \nSecond,  building  on  the  results  of  key  evaluations  of  policy-based  lending,7  the  DSP \n9. \nprovides  for  an  annual  policy  dialogue,  a  participatory  process  engaging  stakeholders  at  the \nFederal,  provincial,  and  local  levels,  including  both  political  and  administrative  organs  of \ngovernment and NGO representatives. The annual performance review process is described in \nAppendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n10. \nAn analysis of the programmatic impacts is provided in the report and recommendation \nof the President (paras. 70-77).

Manila. \n\n6  In  the  DSP,  the  concept  of  accountability  is  used  to  structure  the  Policy  Matrix,  that  is,  (i)  intergovernmental \naccountability,  (ii)  institutional  accountability  (otherwise  referred  to  as  political  \u2013  administrative  relations),  and  (iii) \nconstituency accountability, between citizens and elected representatives.  \n\n7   ADB. 1996.

World Bank, Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nTA2:  Gender  and  Governance  Mainstreaming  will  entail  establishment  of  both  baselines  and \ntargets with respect to gender, access, equity, and sustainability. The program support offices, \nin tandem with PRSP monitoring agencies at the Federal and provincial levels will progressively \nanalyze changes against these baselines, including through the results of Centro Investigacion \nde  Enfermedades  Tropicales  community  social  audit,  the  proposed  core  welfare  indicators \ncluster survey and ongoing surveys under the authority of the Federal and provincial bureaus of \nstatistics.  \n \n\n11. \n \n\na. \n\nGender \n\nb. \n\nAccess \n\nSee Appendix 2, Gender and Governance Sector Analysis.  \n\n12. \nThe DSP will create an enabling environment for positive impact on access in two ways: \n(i) public access to services, and (ii) access to the systems and procedures of local governance. \nDecentralization is intended to improve access of citizens to services through underwriting inter-\ngovernmental  fiscal  reforms  that  are  essential  to  ensure  that  financing  is  available  for  public \nservices as close as possible to the point of delivery. Further, the LGO establishes procedures \nfor  citizen  engagement  in  planning  and  management.  The  roles  of  local  institutions  \u2013  citizen \ncommunity boards and village councils \u2013 along with the various council committees in planning \nand  monitoring  the  delivery  of  services  and  the  special  initiatives  articulated  through  citizen \nsocial  audit  to  be  supported  by  DSP  are  designed  to  increase  accountability  and  the \ntransparency with which public resources are utilized. \n \n13. \nA  necessary  condition  to  the  more  effective  involvement  of  citizens  is  the  systems  in \nplace  to  generate  and  disseminate  management  information  for  decision  makers  in  local  and \nprovincial/Federal  governments.  Improvements  to  the  scope  of  information  generated  about \nlocal  socioeconomic  and  fiscal  conditions  and  the  publication  of  this  information  will  enable \ndecisions  to  be  based  on  analysis  of  widely  legible  and  available  information  about  prevailing \nconditions  rather  than  wholly  privileged  by  personal  or  political  expediency.  Both  aspects  of \naccess,  to  services  and  the  affairs  of  governance,  are  central  to  the  DSP  and  feature,  for  the \nfirst time in an ADB policy loan, as required policy measures in the policy matrix.  \n \n\nc. \n\nEquity \n\ninequity \n\nin  Pakistan \n\n The DSP will support the Government in addressing two key inequities \u2014 gender and \n14. \nlocal  government (LG)  resource  endowment.  Gender \nis  both  a \nmanifestation of and a constraint to poverty reduction. The program has a two pronged strategy: \nfirst,  through  support  to  implement  the  Gender  Reform  Action  Plan,  strengthening  policy  and \ninstitutional mechanisms for gender mainstreaming; and second, through the mainstreaming of \ngender  concerns  in  intergovernmental  systems  and  procedures,  including  targeted  capacity \ndevelopment for women councilors. \n \nThe  horizontal  imbalances  across  LG  units  with  different  resource  endowments  is  a \n15. \nfeature of poverty in Pakistan. The DSP will address horizontal imbalances, through support for \nequalization  and  fiscal  transfer  measures  that  recognize  endowment  inequity,  differentials  in \npoverty,  and  human  development,  and  provide  accordingly  adjusted  allocations  to  LGs.  The \nestablishment of fiscal condition data and analytical capacity to provide information to decision \nmakers  is  a  critical  aspect  of  addressing  endowment  imbalances  and  is  key  to  the  poverty \nreduction strategy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n \n\n33\n\nd. \n\nSustainability \n\n16. \nThe decentralization systems and procedures supported by the DSP are indigenous to \nPakistan.  Through  the  active  involvement  of  the  FD  TA,  considerable  work  has  gone  into \ndeveloping  systems  and  procedures  that  are  appropriate  to  the  capacities  of  elected  LG \nrepresentatives  and  administrators.  DSP  resources  will  be  provided  to  develop  capacities  of \nthose responsible for administering and supervising the implementation of these systems in an \neffort to enhance their operational integrity and sustainability. \n \n\ne. \n\nLabor, Minorities, and Peasants \n\nto \n\nfor \n\nlabor \n\nregulation \n\nresponsibility \n\n(ii)  devolving \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\nThrough  indirect  elections  labor,  minority,  and  peasant  representatives  have  been \n17. \nelected to local government councils. In addition there are opportunities for these groups to form \ncitizen community boards and also to be elected to village councils. Again, DSP resources will \nbe devoted to ensuring that representatives are able to develop their capacities to fully engage \nin the political process. \n \nB. \n \nImpact  on  Labor  Market.  Decentralization  reforms  as  supported  by  the  DSP  are \n18. \naccompanied  by  two  initiatives  impacting  on  the  labor  market:  (i)  deregulation  of  business \nremoving  petty  or  unnecessary  market  entry  and  maintenance \nenterprise,  by \nrestrictions/regulations;  and \nlocal \ngovernments. Whereas the first initiative is expected to improve conditions for business activity, \nand through this, employment opportunities, the second will potentially have more direct impact \non  the  poor.  Unfair,  exploitative  and  corrupt  labor  practices  are  more  likely  to  be  exposed  to \npolitical and administrative redressal mechanisms than in the past. \n \n19. \nImpact on Prices of Goods and Services. Government support for decentralization in \nlarge  measure  reflects  an  expectation  of  improved  allocative  efficiency  and  cost  efficiency  in \nservice  delivery.  Compared  with  the  regional  averages,  the  per  capita  costs  of  public  service \ndelivery (e.g., health and education) are unaccountably high. In the short term, it is not expected \nthat significant service cost reductions will occur. However, failure to demonstrate these gains in \nthe medium term will undermine both public and official support for decentralization.  \n \nImpact  on  Public  Expenditures.  Decentralization  will  not  be  expenditure  neutral, \n20. \nhowever,  its  budget  impact  has  been  fully  factored  into  Federal  and  province  medium-term \nprojections  (including  International  Monetary  Fund  PRGF  calculations).  Increased  budgetary \nallocation to service delivery, at the primary delivery points, will be a direct consequence of the \npolicy  measures  supported  by  the  Program.  Sustaining  increased  and  more  effective \nexpenditures  on  pro-poor  services  is  one  of  the  primary,  overriding  concerns  of  the  systems, \nprocedures, and fiscal measures integral to the DSP.  \n \n21. \nbelow. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nImpact on Access to Public Goods and Services.

Despite some improvement over the last 30 years, the status of \n1. \nwomen in Pakistan is appalling. In the absence of gender-disaggregated, poverty-related data, a \nsystematic gender analysis of poverty process remains elusive, but it is increasingly evident that \npoverty is feminized: women bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of poverty within \nthe family and society. Moreover, the poorer the family, the higher is the likelihood of significant \ndependence  on  female  labor.    Global  comparators  give  some  indication  of  gender  poverty  in \nPakistan. In the United Nations Development Programme's Gender-related Development Index \n2000, Pakistan ranks 135 of 174 countries. On the Gender Empowerment Measurement 1999, \nPakistan ranks 100th out of 102 countries measured. The social indicators for women\u2019s status \nare  the  poorest  in  the  region.  Female  literacy  is  only  29%  as  compared  with  a  literacy  rate  of \n55%  for  men.  Pakistan  is  one  of  the  few  countries  where  the  male:female  ratio  is  reversed. \nThere are 108 men to every 100 women. The female infant mortality rate is higher (85 per 1,000 \nlive  births)  than  that  of  male  children  (82  per  1,000).  Only  47%  of  female  children  are  fully \nimmunized  as  compared  with  52%  of  boys.  Forty  percent  of  adult  women  suffer  from  anemia. \nDue to early marriages, repeated pregnancy without proper spacing, poor nutritional status, and \nlack of professional medical care during pregnancy and delivery of the child, maternal mortality \nrate remains high: 1 woman in every 38 dies from pregnancy-related causes. The female labor \nforce participation rate is reported as only 13.6% as compared with 69.1% for males due to the \nconcentration of women in the informal sector, which is undocumented and characterized by a \nhigher level of exploitation.  According to the 1990-1991 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, \nmore than three fourths of the economically active women in urban areas are employed in the \ninformal  sector.  The  legal  status  of  women  has  been  reduced  through  various  discriminatory \nlaws.  Violence  against  women  remains  an  everyday  experience  across  the  class,  region,  and \nrural-urban divides.1  \n \n2. \nAccess  to  Political  Processes.  Women\u2019s  exclusion  from  political  and  administrative \ngovernance  structures  has  a  strong  link  with  high  incidence  of  poverty.  Despite  women\u2019s \nparticipation in political processes and political parties, their representation was less than 3% in \nthe  last  national  assembly  (7  out  of  217),  0.4%  (1  out  of  483)  in  provincial  legislative \nassemblies,  and  nearly  13%  in  local  government  prior  to  the  Decentralization  Plan.  Within \npolitical parties women are not appointed to decision-making positions. Women\u2019s representation \nin the central executive committee of two major political parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party and \nthe Pakistan Muslim League is not more than 3 of 21 and 5 of 47, respectively. \n \n3. \nWomen  in  Civil  Service.  There  are  massive  gender  disparities  in  public  sector \nemployment  including  the  civil  service.  Women  are  concentrated  at  the  lower  end  of  the  job \nhierarchy: 64.5% are working in BPS (basic pay scale) 5.15 grade. There is no woman in grade \n22, while only 2 (1%) are in grade 21 as against 205 men and 23 in grade 20 (2.5%) as against \n890 men.2 No woman serves at the highest level of the judiciary, the Supreme Court. Only two \nwomen hold the position of High Court judges. Among the subordinate judiciary there are only \n76 women judges as compared with 1,188 male judges. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 In the absence of national data on violence against women, some micro level research studies have indicated the \nextent  and  nature  of  violence  against  women.  A  study  conducted  by  the  Ministry  for  Women\u2019s  Development \nsuggests that domestic violence take place in approximately 80% of the households. \n\n2 Federal Government Civil Servants (1993). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nWomen\u2019s  Access  to  Entitlements.  Women\u2019s  exclusion  from  governance  structures \n4. \nand processes has led to the neglect of women\u2019s concerns and interest in national policies and \npriorities  that  have  direct  impact  over  their  lives.  The  patriarchal  bias  in  state  institutions \ntranslates  into  underinvestment  in  their  social  and  economic  entitlements  and  reinforces  the \nhigher  incidence  of  poverty  and  powerlessness  among  women.  Therefore,  women's  groups \nargue  that  political  participation  and  representation  in  governance  structures  is  critical  to \ntransforming  institutions  in  favor  of  women,  especially  poor  women.  There  has  been  a  long- \nstanding demand from women\u2019s rights activists and organizations that the state must adopt an \naffirmative  action  policy  as  the  key  strategy  to  increase  women\u2019s  political  participation  and \nrepresentation. \n \nB. \n\nNational Commitments on Gender  \n\n5. \nGlobal  and  National  Covenants.  The  Government  has  exhibited  a  new  concern  with \nthe  question  of  gender  equity.    Soon  after  it  took  over,  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Development \nsubmitted  to  the  Chief  Executive  a  10-point  agenda  to  amend  laws  that  discriminate  against \nwomen.    The  Government  created  an  independent  Permanent  Commission  on  the  Status  of \nWomen  in  July  2000  to  examine  policy  and  programs  as  they  relate  to  gender  equality;  to \nreview  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  affecting  women\u2019s  rights;  and  to  suggest  amendments  or \nnew  legislation.    After  extensive  consultations  a  number  of  laws  were  redrafted  to  make  them \ngender  sensitive.    These  include  the  Family  Law  Ordinance  and  Rules,  Nikahnama  form \n(marriage license), Family Court Act, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, and Child Marriage \nRestraint Act. So far, however, the conservative religious lobby has prevented the enactment of \nthese  reforms.  The  Government  has  also  declared  that  all  \u201chonor  killings\u201d  will  be  treated  as \nmurder. And it is seeking to improve women\u2019s voice and access to resources by increasing their \npolitical representation: a third of local council seats have been reserved for women (resulting in \na total of 36,007 women elected across all four provinces, although not all reserved seats were \nfilled).  The  number  of  seats  reserved  for  women  in  the  future  National  Assembly  will  be \nincreased from 20 to 60.  Policy commitments include launching of the National Plan of Action \n(NPA) in 1998; formulation of National Policy on Development and Empowerment of Women in \n2002;  and  ratification  of  the  Convention  on  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  Against \nWomen \nInternational  Labor  Organization  Convention  100  on  Equal \nRemuneration.   \n \nIneffective  Implementation  Arrangements.  However,  these  commitments  have  not \n6. \nbeen  matched  by  political,  administrative,  and \nfiscal  support.  Within  government, \npolitical/technical  support  to  women  representatives  or  to  mainstream  women\u2019s  concerns  into \npublic  policy  and  planning  across  sectors  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of  formal  horizontal  and \nvertical  administrative  linkages  among  the  Ministry,  Women's  Development  Directorate,  and \nother key ministries and departments such as Finance, Agriculture, Education, and Health. The \nMinistry  and  provincial  Women's  Development  Directorates  have  only  marginal  impact  on \ndevelopment  policies  or  programs.  From  1997  to  the  present,  the  Ministry  has  established  26 \nfocal points to implement the NPA in the line ministries to coordinate and ensure incorporation \nof  gender  concerns  in  their  respective  sectors.  Most  of  these  focal  points  lack  essential \nacademic  qualifications  and  experience,  and  none  of  them  are  trained  in  gender  analysis  and \nplanning skills. \n \n7. \nBold  Steps  toward  Political  Representation.  In  line  with  national  (NPA)  and \nthe  present  military \ninternational  commitments  (CEDAW) \ngovernment  took  a  bold  step  to  reserve  33%  seats  for  women  in  all  three  tiers  of  local \ngovernment. They are elected through direct election at the union council level and indirectly at \n\nto  promote  gender  equality, \n\n(CEDAW),  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n37\n\nthe tehsil and district levels. Also, women are given 17% representation through the reservation \nof  seats  in  the  national  and  provincial  assemblies,  they  will  be  elected  through  a  proportional \nrepresentation  system.  This  is  the  most  strategic  step  undertaken  by  the  present  government \ntowards  women\u2019s  political  empowerment;  it  has  enabled  30,864  women  to  enter  into  formal \npolitics at the local government level. \n \nC. \n\nPolitical Participation and Representation \n\nImportance  of  Local  Representation.  Male  domination  of  political  processes  and \n8. \nstructures  has  historically  excluded  women  from  governance,  resulting  in  the  neglect  of \nwomen\u2019s concerns and interests in public policies, the most fundamental political instrument that \ndirectly  affects  their  lives.    Women  lack  access  to  the  means  of  political  participation  such  as \npolitical  skills,  economic  resources,  education,  training,  and  access  to  information  due  to \nstructural and cultural barriers and the male domination of political parties and the bureaucracy. \nWithin this socioeconomic context, local government is the most feasible tier of government for \nwomen to enter into formal politics. At the local level women know about local issues and can \nplay  a  role  in  solving  them.  Local  government  can  become  a  place  for  women  to  develop \npolitical  skills  and  enable  them  to  enter  into  higher  tiers  of  government  at  the  provincial  and \nnational  levels.  However,  without  decentralization  of  administrative,  legal,  and  financial  power, \nthe local government institutions become irrelevant to women. \n \n9. \nKey  Support  Requirements  for  Women  Representatives.  Reservation  of  33%  seats \nfor women in all three tiers of local government has enabled a large number of women to enter \ninto  local  politics.  Despite  patriarchal  resistance  in  strongholds  of  tribal  and  feudal  politics, \nparticularly, in North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, where the local male elite along \nwith  religious  groups  and  political  parties,  signed  agreements  to  stop  women  participating  as \nvoters and candidates in elections, only 9% of the seats reserved for women remained vacant. \nThere  is  no  doubt  that  a  large  number  of  women  were  nominated  at  the  union  council    (UC) \nlevel as a result of local political factions dividing women\u2019s seats among themselves and that no \ncontest was allowed to take place on women\u2019s reserved seats. This kind of nomination process \nundermined women\u2019s chances and opportunities to participate in the electoral process and learn \npolitical skills.  The majority of women councilors, especially those who were elected at the UC \nlevel,  are  the  nominees  of  local  elites  or  male  members  of  their  families.  They  have  entered \npolitics for the first time. They lack political and institutional support systems to play an effective \nrole.  They  also  lack  political  and  management  skills,  as  the  majority  of  them  do  not  belong  to \npolitical parties and are not well connected with civil society organizations. The profile of women \ncouncilors indicates that the majority at the UC level are illiterate. Clear need exists for political \neducation  as  well  as  technical  competency  with  the  systems  and  procedures  of  local \ngovernment  (how  to  serve  their  constituency,  community  mobilization,  agenda  setting, \ndevelopment planning and budgeting, inter-local government relations, etc.). \n \n10.  Multipronged  Strategy  Required.  Engendering  the  governance  processes  and \nstructures  demands  a  multipronged  strategy  to  enhance  women\u2019s  capacities  as  voters  and \ncandidates  through  information  and  training  packages  and  establishing  a  support  system  for \nelectoral  campaign  management  and  ongoing  advisory  services  and  exchanges.  The  National \nReconstruction  Bureau  and  Ministry  of  Women's  Development,  Social  Welfare  and  Special \nEducation  (MWD)  have  initiated  training  and  networking  programs  for  women  representatives. \nTo  institutionalize  these  efforts,  a  comprehensive  National  Program  for  Women\u2019s  Political \nParticipation is under preparation by MWD encompassing all political tiers of government, i.e., \ndistrict  assembly,  provincial  assembly,  national  assembly,  and  the  senate.    MWD  will  further \ndevelop  this  Program  under  a  broader  Gender  Reform  Action  Plan,  which  will  be  prepared \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nunder  TA  3823:  Gender  Reform  Program.  The  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP)  will \nsupport  implementation  of  this  Program  following  approval  by  the  Federal  and  provincial \ncabinets. \n \nD. \n\nKey Issues and Opportunities \n\nto \n\nRepresentation and Empowerment. Representation of women is a necessary but not \n11. \na  sufficient  condition \nimpact  on  governance  structures  and  processes.  Women\u2019s \nempowerment, given representative opportunities, depends on training, political education, and \nenhancing  their  ability  to  negotiate  and  promote  gender  interests  effectively  in  planning  and \nbudgetary  processes  of  local  government  systems.    The  key  challenges  faced  by  women \nrepresentatives in local government are (i) a generalized limitation in political and administrative \ncapacity  within  local  government,  in  particular  in  policy  formulation,  planning  and  budgetary \nprocesses,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  a  lack  of  political  support  for  women \nrepresentatives from public institutions and civil society organizations; and (iii) the prevalence of \npatriarchal rules, norms, and practices of institutions. \n \n12. \nPerceived  Powerlessness.  Women  councilors  have  a  strong  sense  of  powerlessness \ndue to control of male nazims over decision-making processes and financial resources. Males \nperceive  that  women  councilors  represent  only  women  and  that  they  should  be  assigned  to \ntraditional  social  welfare-type  activities.  At  the  UC  level,  women  councilors  are  frequently  not \neven invited to council\u2019s meetings. They complain about not having access to district financial \nresources  for  development  work  like  male  councilors.  They  lack  institutional  support  such  as \noffice space, separate toilets, and honoraria. \n \n13. \nCapacity-Building Needs. The needs of women councilors are enormous and deserve \na high priority in the national, provincial, and district level training programs. The investment in \ncapacity development and networking with women\u2019s councilors will equip them to deal with the \npatriarchal  institutional  norms  and  practices.  An  acute  need  is  expressed  by  the  women \ncouncilors  for  information  about  their  roles  and  responsibilities  and  the  local  government \nsystem.  They  are  struggling  to  create  space  for  themselves  within  the  system.  They  have  a \ngenuine desire to be able to play their role as public representatives effectively; however, they \nlack political support systems within and outside local government. Male domination of political \nparties and the weak popular base of the women\u2019s movement in Pakistan have caused a lack of \nresponse to the needs of newly elected women councilors.  \n \nOpportunities  also  exist  to  address  structural  constraints  by  focusing  and  increasing \n14. \nsector investment on capacity building through combining social and technical training content \nwith  innovative  delivery  methods,  political  education,  and  social  organization  (networking)  of \nlocal female councilors.  Presently there is no vertical linkage between women councilors of the \nUC,  tehsil,  and  district.    They  are  facing  more  or  less  similar  problems  but  unable  to  resolve \nthem  within  their  own  tier  of  local  government.    Development  of  an  association  of  women \ncouncilors across three tiers of local government could become an affective vehicle to organize \non  gender  and  social  development  issues  and  raise  a  collective  voice  to  negotiate  gender \nconcerns within the local government system. \n \n15. \nEngendering  Decentralized  Systems.  A  preliminary  gender  review  of  public  sector \nexpenditure and its management at the Federal, provincial, and district level suggests a critical \nneed  for  establishment  of  cross-sector  and  comprehensive  gender  analysis,  planning, \nbudgeting, auditing and monitoring systems, methodology, and mechanisms to ensure gender-\nbalanced resource distribution at the Federal, provincial, and district levels. Institutional capacity \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n \n\n39\n\nto gather and analyze gender- and poverty-focused disaggregated data is imperative to inform \npolicy,  planning,  and  budgetary  processes  of  local  governments.  Presently,  information \nmanagement  systems  are  not  providing  gender  disaggregated  information  that  could  inform \npolicy  and  planning.  The  gender  imbalance  within  the  institution;  the  domination  of  men  in \npolicy-making positions; and the lack of institutional capacity to carry out gender, governance, \nand broad policy analysis is a common problem that continues to shape sector priorities in favor \nof  men.  The  DSP  will  help  to  identify  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity \nbuilding  requirements  of  local  government  institutions  to  integrate  gender  and  social \ndevelopment  analysis  and  concerns  adequately.  The  health  and  education  sectors  can  be \nsupported to take the lead to develop gender-based performance indicators for gender analysis \nand planning. \n \nA  proactive  citizenry  is  central  to  good  governance.  Without  an  active  and  effective \n16. \nparticipation  of  people  in  development  planning  and  implementation  processes,  there  is  no \nguarantee that good governance will automatically result in social equity. People\u2019s engagement \nin  governance  processes  is  key  for  a  transparent  and  accountable  local  government  system. \nThe DSP will also support community-based statutory bodies such as citizen community boards, \nvillage  councils,  monitoring  committees,  and  alternate  dispute  resolution  agencies  for \nstrengthening people\u2019s voices in policy and development decisions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nA. \n\nThe Decentralization Program \n\nDECENTRALIZATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nPolicy  Commitment  and  Strategy.  Governance  reforms  aim  to  address  four  major \n1. \nissues: civil service reform; reduction of corruption; improvement of financial management; and \ndecentralization,  the  cornerstone  of  governance  reform  policy.  Decentralization  has  strategic \nimportance to the Government of Pakistan if it is done properly, it can be a powerful means for \nattaining  such  ends  as  the  efficiency  and  coverage  of  service  delivery,  reducing  poverty  and \ngender disparities, stimulating local economic development, increasing local participation, public \naccountability,  governmental  legitimacy,  and  involving  the  private  sector  in  local  governance \nefforts.  \n \nCivil  Service  Reform.1  This  has  been  focused  on  at  the  Federal  level,  which,  even \n2. \nthough  representing  only  a  small  proportion  of  total  public  employment,  sets  the  tone  for  the \nprovinces.    Some  progress  has  been  made  in  three  key  areas  where  reform  was  needed:  (i) \nmerit  in  recruitment  and  promotion,  (ii)  pay  and  pension  reform  \u2013  although  concerns  of  a \ngrowing unfunded pension liability remain, and (iii) right-sizing and restructuring.  Similar actions \nare needed at the provincial level. Although the Federal civil service represents a comparatively \nsmall  proportion  of  total  public  employment,  reforms  are  critically  important  because  they  set \nstandards  that  are  emulated  in  regard  to  both  pay  and  conditions  of  service  in  the  provinces \nand, to a lesser degree, in state-owned enterprises. Some progress has been made in three key \nareas where reform was needed. \n \n\nMerit  in  recruitment  and  promotion.  The  government  has  strengthened  the \nauthority  and  independence  of  the  Federal  Public  Service  Commission  (FPSC), \nincreased its financial autonomy and expanding its role in recruitment.  FPSC will \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\nrecruit  for  all  positions  at  BPS2  (basic  pay  scale)  16  and  above,  with  no \nexceptions; \nrecruit  for  grades  11-15  in  11  departments  and  organizations  with \nrelatively  greater  opportunities  for  corruption  (e.g.,  Central  Board  of \nRevenue, Federal Investigation Agency); \nreview  appointments  made  in  contravention  of  established  procedures, \nincluding contracts, and terminate unqualified appointments; \noversee promotions to BPS 20; \nimprove  required  training  and  examinations  for  promotion  to  grades  17, \n19, and 20. \n\nThese  are  important  reforms,  designed  to  eliminate  the  politicization  of  civil \nservice appointments that had been so damaging. Similar strategies have been \nfollowed  in  the  provinces  with  varying  degrees  of  vigor,  with  Sindh  in  the  lead, \nand the provincial public service commissions have been strengthened. \n\nPay and pension reform. A new pay and pension package went into effect on 1 \nDecember  2001.  It  includes  a  sizeable  increase  in  salaries  (although  below  the \n75%  increase  in  the  Consumer  Price  Index  the  last  adjustment  in  1994)  and \n\n                                                 \n1  Remarks  on  civil  service  reform  drawn  from  World  Bank.  2002.  Pakistan  Development  Policy  Review:  A  New \n\nDawn? Washington, DC.  \n\n2  BPS is a grading indicator of public servants. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Appendix 3 \n \n \n\n \n\n41\n\nsignificant  changes  in  pensions.  Basic  government  wages  were  very  low  (only \nabout  half  the  ratio  of  wages  to  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  in  similar \ncountries). The increase has lifted salaries, but these remain low, especially for \nthe  higher  grades.  It  did  not  decompress  wages  significantly,  but  it  did  reduce \nmonetary  allowances  from  nearly  40%  of  the  wage  bill  to  approximately  27%. \nActions are needed to improve the medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability of \nthe  pension  system.  The  December  2001  changes  to  the  pension  system \nincluded  (i)  revising  the  commutation  factors,  (ii)  capping  pension  credit  for \nservice after 30 years, and (iii) abolishing the restoration of commuted pensions \nand  preventing  pension  augmentation.  These  changes  served,  in  part,  to \ncounterbalance the effect of the pay reform on the Government\u2019s defined benefit \npension liability. However, concerns remain that the Government has a growing \nunfunded pension liability, significantly driven by the cost of military pensions.  \n\nRight-sizing  and \nrestructuring.  The  Committee  on  Right-sizing  and \nRestructuring introduced a series of reforms in 2001 to reduce in stages the ratio \nof  staff  (grades  1-16,  14,000  staff  as  of  July  2001)  to  officers  (grades  17-22)  in \nthe  main  ministries  of  the  civilian  Central  Government.  Surplus  staff  would  be \nplaced  in  a  pool  (1,000  as  of  July  2001)  with  full  salary  and  benefits  for  two \nyears, followed by retrenchment if they have not found other posts. This proposal \nhas  little  fiscal  impact  because  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  federal \nemployees (if it meets its targets, the saving would be of the order of 1% of the \ntotal Federal wage bill).  \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \nThe  larger  problem  is  that  decades  of  patronage-based  employment  and  inattention  to \n3. \nskills  mix  have  undermined  the  work  ethic  and  created  an  entitlement  culture  in  which  status \nand  inter-cadre  rivalries  outweigh  concerns  about  service  to  the  public  or  to  the  Government. \nThe  significance  of  the  Committee  on  Right-sizing  and  Restructuring  will  be  the  signals  that  it \nsends  about government readiness  to tackle the culture of entitlement and status. The middle \nlevel  of  the  civil  service  has  suffered  particularly  from  episodes  of  patronage  and  political \nmanipulation,  exacerbated  by  very  low  pay.    The  recent  reforms  have  enhanced  managerial \nflexibility in the Federal civil service, but it will take many years for the newly reconstituted merit \nprocesses and emphasis on performance to reduce the numbers of nonperforming staff at these \nmiddle levels. In the shorter term, a human resource management information system to track \nstaff could help to improve staff deployment, and increased lateral entry could recruit new talent.  \nThe number of lower grade staff needs to be reduced, inter alia by greater use of Information \nTechnology.    These  reforms  need  to  be  replicated  at  the  provincial  level.    Refinements  to  the \nLocal Government Ordinance and associated rules are to be prepared to enhance civil servant \nresponsiveness to citizens and to pass responsibility for staff recruitment and discipline from the \nprovincial governments to the districts, accompanied by a review of options for creating district \ncadres. \n \n4. \nCorruption and Accountability. The National Accountability Bureau, established by the \nPresident  in  1999,  appears  to  have  made  a  significant  impact  on  the  problem  of  \u201cgrand\u201d \ncorruption,  but  the  general  public  appears  less  convinced  of  progress  with  regard  to  low-level \ncorruption.  Accountability  within  government  has  been  improved  significantly,  especially  the \nquality of the Federal budget presentation. Planned reforms to the Central Board of Revenue, \nwidely regarded as the most corrupt governmental institution, show considerable promise, with \nthe assessment and collection functions being split and made anonymous.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDecentralization  Plan  Reforms.  The  Government  is  committed  to  implementing  the \n5. \nreforms indicated in the Decentralization Plan 2000 with two main thrusts. First, the Government \nmade  a  commitment  to  a  thorough  restructuring  at  the  Federal  and  provincial  levels  and  to \nassign,  as  part  of  this  process,  primary  service  delivery  responsibilities  to  local  governments \nunder  the  control  of  democratically  elected  councils.  Intergovernmental  restructuring  began  at \nthe  local  level  with  elections  and  promulgation  of  the  Local  Government  Ordinance  (LGO) \nduring August 2001. Restructuring of the roles of the provincial and Federal governments and of \nintergovernmental  relations  between  these  tiers  of  government  is  to  follow,  though  this  is \nrecognized to be a more technically and politically complex commitment. The Government has \ncommitted  to  announcing  these  changes  before  the  October  Federal  and  provincial  elections. \nThe  second  feature  of  the  Decentralization  Plan  was  that  governmental  reforms  \u2013  that  is, \nrealignment of governmental systems, procedures, the civil service, and fiscal relations \u2013 should \nproceed only once the restructuring had occurred. In respect of local government reforms, much \nprogress  has  been  made,  focusing  in  particular  on  (i)  local  government  systems,  procedures, \nand  political/administrative  arrangements;  and  (ii) \nintergovernmental  relations  between \nprovinces  and  local  governments.  At  the  province  level,  new  institutions  have  been  created, \nincluding  not  just  the  provincial  finance  commissions  and  local  government  commissions,  but \nalso creation of new institutions required under the Police Ordinance promulgated on 14 August \n2002.  Given  that  restructuring  of  the  provincial  and  Federal  governments,  and  of  the  relations \nbetween  them  has  not  yet  been  announced,  efforts  towards  more  classically  defined  \"civil \nservice reforms\" have not advanced appreciably. \n \n6. \nGovernance  Reforms  and  Poverty.  The  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper \n(IPRSP)  describes  decentralization  as  the  major  instrument  to  improve  access  to  education, \nhealth, and other public services.  Decentralization will take time to become effective, given the \nimportant  challenges  of  addressing  capacity  constraints,  especially  at  the  district  level  and \nbelow.  The institutional changes introduced by decentralization could increase the incentives of \nlocal  government  to  improve  service  delivery,  using  electoral  competitions  through  local \nelections, to weaken the systems of patronage that have often dominated in the past.  Yet it is \nclear from both domestic and international experience that decentralization is no panacea, and \nat best it takes time to implement the essential institutional reforms.  \n \nPublic-private  partnerships  can  potentially  help  in  improving  access  to  and  quality  of \n7. \nservice  delivery.  The  Education  Sector  Reform  articulated  in  the  IPRSP  incorporates  some \ninitiatives,  but  it  falls  short  of  exploiting  the  potential  role  of  the  private  sector  in  bringing \neducation to the underprivileged. Given the lower costs of the private sector, it is at least worth \nconsidering  whether  public  subsidies  \u2013  either  in  the  form  of  vouchers  to  parents  for  the \neducation  of  children  at  selected  private  schools,  or  as  direct  subsidies  to  private  schools  \u2013 \nmight  play  a  role  in  expanding  the  enrollment  of  poor  children.3    Arguments  in  favor  of  such \nsubsidies, on grounds of improving access, efficiency, and quality, need to be weighed carefully \nagainst the possibility that scarce public resources would be better spent in improving the public \nschool system, which typically has more universal reach. \n \n8. \nLocal Government Reforms. At the local government level, reforms in the political and \nadministrative  machinery  of  government  have  been  most  dramatic.  Political  changes,  which \nhave  yet  to  be  defined  through  amendments  to  the  Constitution  of  1973,  point  towards  the \n\n                                                 \n3  An  example  of  success  in  such  endeavors  is  the  Quetta  Urban  Fellowship  Program,  in  which  private  schools \ncontrolled  by  the  community  in  poor  urban  neighborhoods  were  encouraged  to  establish  new  facilities  for  girls \nthrough subsidies paid directly to the schools, resulting in a substantial positive impact on female enrollments in the \ntarget neighborhoods.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Appendix 3 \n \n \n\n \n\n43\n\ncreation of a third tier of government, converting Pakistan from a unitary federation into a federal \nsystem. The Decentralization Plan of 2000 provided for three levels of local government, each \nwith  a  governing  council:  district  governments  numbering  96,  tehsils  numbering  350  (around \nthree per district) and union councils (UCs) numbering 6022 (around 20-30 per tehsil), which are \ncomprised  of  villages  or  urban  wards.  Local  elections  on  a  nonpartisan  basis,  with  full  adult \nsuffrage and a lowered voting age (from 21 to 18) reserved 30% of seats for women at all three \nlevels  of  local  government,  and  additional  seats  are  reserved  for  peasants,  workers,  and \nminorities.  The  LGOs  promulgated  by  each  provincial  government  provide  a  number  of \ninstitutionalized  opportunities  for  citizen  participation  in  council  affairs.  Citizen  community \nboards will provide avenues for community participation in local development, while the council \nmonitoring  committees  and  public  safety  commissions  will  monitor  local  government  activities. \nCitizen  community  boards  are  also  empowered  to  prioritize  investments  for  up  to  25%  of  the \nlocal development budget for basic infrastructure and services. Public safety commissions at the \ndistrict, provincial, and national levels, introduced by this Government under amendments to the \nPolice Act of 1861 and the Police Ordinance of 2002, offer new possibilities to depoliticize the \npolice and to increase their accountability to citizens. Second, the Government is committed to \nproviding genuine local autonomy through fiscal support. This will take the form of a number of \nmeasures: (i) decentralization of tax/fee authority to local units, (ii) provision of an alternative to \nthe  present  arrangement  of  provincial  funds  on  a  population  basis,  and  (iii)  provision  of  block \ngrants to local units from the Federal Government for sector programs such as local education.  \n \n9. \nPast Efforts at Decentralization. Since Independence Pakistan has seen at least four \nreforms  in  the  name  of  \u201cempowering  local  government.\u201d  First,  the  Constitution  of  1956 \nvisualized  a  decentralized  federation  with  significant  provincial  public  spending  responsibilities \nand revenue-raising powers. A key role of the Federal Government was to exercise its tax and \nspending powers to ensure a base of comparable series across the nation through the vehicle \nof  a  system  of  fiscal  transfers  to  provincial  governments  in  a  manner  that  would  influence \nprovincial-local delivery of public services. Second, in 1958, following a military coup, General \nAyub  Khan  promised  \u201cbasic  democracy\u201d  and  a  system  of  local  self  government;  and  although \nthere were some local elections, decentralization never took hold. Third, the 1973 Constitution \nwas enacted with a provision for a two-tier federation in which local government is treated as a \nconcurrent subject of both Federal and provincial governments. Fourth, in the early 1990s, the \nNational  Finance  Commission  initiated  a  process  of  expenditure  realignment  intended  to  give \nprovinces control of health and education. But in the end, it was administrative decentralization \n(deconcentration)  and  not  decentralization.  The  latest  round  is  arguably  the  most  far-reaching \neffort to devolve real powers to democratically elected local governments.  \n \n \nImplementation  Progress.  The  Pakistani  decentralization  can  be  considered  \u201cfast \n10. \ntrack\u201d \nfiscal,  and  administrative  decentralization  has  been  pursued \nin \nsimultaneously, but with the political dimension sequenced ahead of the fiscal and economic. To \nimprove  accountability  and  decentralize  basic  social  services  delivery,  decentralization  set  in \nmotion  a  reorganization  of  state  structures  at  multiple  tiers  of  government.  Much  has  been \nachieved  since  inception  of  the  Decentralization  Plan  in  2000,  including  promulgation  of  the \nLGO  in  August  2001  and  completion  of  local  elections.  Work  to  define  the  procedures  for \ndecentralized planning, financing, accountability, and service delivery is almost complete, based \non the concept of a divisible pool of provincial resources to be shared with the districts on the \nbasis of needs and performance. These procedures will be put in place by local governments in \nthe first half of 2002, in time for full effect from FY2003. \n \n\nthat  political, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n1. \n\nImplementation of Devolved Political Systems \n\n11. \nThe  political  objective  has  been  to  build  local  accountability  for  service  performance  to \nlocal  electorates.  While  there  is  a  tradition  of  elections  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels \ninterspersed  with  military  coups  and  with  a  mixture  of  elected  and  appointed  bodies  used  in \nvarious provinces, this is less the case locally (elections in 1959, 1979, 1983, 1987, and 1998). \nThere has been no tradition of political accountability of elected local politicians to an electorate \nfor  the  delivery  of  local  services.  One  of  the  main  aims  of  the  new  system  of  decentralization \nwas to dramatically and quickly try to redress this problem by the election, direct and indirect, of \npoliticians  at  all  three  levels  of  local  government.  The  basic  building  block  is  the  UC  and  the \ndirect election of a potential 126,462 union councilors, who in turn determine the membership of \nthe tehsil and district councils.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDecentralization of Fiscal Resource/Management Systems \n\n12. \nThe fiscal resource/management system's objectives consist of (i) provision of additional \nfiscal  and  personnel  resources  to  local  governments;  (ii)  strengthening  of  fiscal  accounting, \nreporting,  and  control  systems;  and  (iii)  adoption  of  new  fiscal  systems  in  such  areas  as \nprocurement and development budgeting. \n \n \nAdditional  Local  Fiscal  and  Personnel  Resources.  Local  governments  have  been \n13. \ngiven  new  statutory  sources  of  revenue.  They  now  have  the  independence  to  decide  on  the \nrates as well levies. Two new taxes, namely health and education taxes, have been given to the \nlocal councils. In the current fiscal year the local governments receive grants for operation and \nmaintenance  of  service  delivery  systems  and  development  from  the  provincial  governments. \nProvinces  are  paying  salaries  of  the  local  government  establishments,  which  constitute  more \nthan four fifths of their total budgetary outlays. \n \nDistricts  rely  primarily  on  provincial  transfers,  which  are,  in  turn,  financed  largely  from \n14. \nFederal  transfers.  Until  1998,  urban  tehsils  collected  octroi  (import  taxes  levied  by  municipal \nentities  at  their  borders  on  goods  imported  for  resale),  while  rural  ones  collected  zila  export \ntaxes on agricultural goods exported out of rural (then called \u201czila\u201d) councils. Together, the octroi \n(collected  largely  in  urban  areas)  and  zila  (rural  areas)  taxes  accounted  for  50%  to  60%  of \nautonomous local revenues. While producing revenue yields, both taxes were notorious for their \ninefficiency and as a source of corruption. Under the decentralization, district governments have \nlarge  expenditure  responsibilities  while  relying  on  narrow  revenue  bases.  Though  districts \nreceived greater budget authority from the decentralization, they also face additional earmarked \nexpenditures to be financed by revenue sources of uncertain yield. This means that either the \nfiscal gaps will need to be filled by more provincial transfers, or services will again be of poor \nquality. In the informal hierarchy of local governments, UCs receive grants from districts, mainly \nfrom the development budget. Such grants are made according to decisions by district councils, \nwith  various  criteria  used.  Tehsils  have  access  to  (a  predecentralization)  urban  immovable \nproperty tax (UIPT) and various fees and user charges.  The UIPT, which contributes only 3-5% \nof  total  tehsil  revenues,  is  administered  and  collected  by  the  provinces,  with  80.75%  of \ncollections remitted to tehsils and the remainder retained by the provinces. The UIPT is levied in \nrating areas as determined by the law, after which the tax is levied at a minimum rate, but with \ntehsil councils then having the authority to add a surcharge. To date, no tehsil has yet levied an \nadditional rate, with the newly elected politicians arguing that the voters will not perceive the link \nbetween increased taxes and services as a quid pro quo. Decentralization should lead to wider \ntax bases in the entire tehsil and not only in urban areas (rating areas). The hope is that districts \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Appendix 3 \n \n \n\n \n\n45\n\ncan  collect  taxes  initially  for  tehsils  and  later  devolve  revenue  administration  to  the  tehsils \nthemselves to finance their municipal services.  \n \n15. \nPersonnel  Resources  and  Institutional  Restructuring.  The  decentralization  reforms \nhave tackled both staffing and institutional weaknesses.  It makes little sense to increase staff \ncapacity  if  their  institutional  roles  and  responsibilities  lead  to  inefficient  and  ineffective  service \nresults.  In  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP),  for  example,  about  200,000  of  280,000 \nprovincial  employees  have  been  assigned  to  districts;  district  budgeting  and  other  nonpolicy \nfunctions  have  been  transferred  to  the  districts.  NWFP  has  restructured  26  departments, \ndownsizing  and  refocusing  them  according  to  functions.  Over  6,000  employees  have  been \nplaced  in  a  surplus  pool  as  the  result  of  these  activities.  It  is  critically  important  that  the  new \npersonnel resources not absorb the nonwage portion of district budgets. Salaries now account \nfor  about  85%  of  district  government  budgets.  NWFP  development  programs  have  been \nrationalized  as  one  response  to  this  problem.  The  share  of  development  expenditures  in  total \nexpenditures increased from 10%-15% in FY1998 to 25% in FY2002.  \n \nUnder decentralization, district staff continues to consist largely of detailed provincial civil \n16. \nservants. For the first year of decentralization they were paid directly from the province, i.e., the \nsalary component of the district budget was not transferred in FY2002. There are, however, real \npolicy issues surrounding the designation and reporting lines of district staff. Many have faced \ndifficulties in coming to terms with a reporting mechanism that is within a district (essentially to \nthe  District  Coordination  Officer)  rather  than  back  to  the  parent  provincial  line  department.  \nProvincial  line  departments  similarly  have  been  slow  to  relinquish  direct  management  and \ncontrol over their staff in the districts.  There is also much more work to be done on changing \nthe culture and outlook of officials working at the district level. As long as their career prospects \ndepend  on  provincial  or  Federal  department  decisions,  their  commitment  to  districts  will \ninevitably  be  weak.    Decentralization  of  payroll,  recruitment,  and  career  management \nresponsibilities to local governments is expected to be completed by end 2003.  \n \n17. \nImproved  Expenditure  Accounting,  Reporting,  and  Control.  Decentralization  in  any \ncontext requires assurance that funds transferred or spent directly will be controlled consistent \nwith  clear  norms,  regular  reports,  and  accurate  accounts.  Failure  to  have  systems  in  place  to \nperform  these  basic  functions  risks  increased  public  dissatisfaction  with  local  government  and \ncould  threaten  the  progress  of  the  decentralization.  Pakistan  is  implementing  new  systems  of \naccounting and control. The charts of accounts and basic systems design have been produced \nand  codified  through  work  from  the  Fiscal  Decentralization  technical  assistance.  A  new \naccounting model is being developed and implemented. The backbone of the effort to improve \ncontrol  down  to  the  district/tehsil/union  level  is  the  Project  on  Improvement  on  Financial \nReporting  and  Auditing  (PIFRA).  This  is  an  effort  to  move  from  the  existing  system  of  manual \naccounting  and  control  (basically  provincially  installed  systems)  to  install  a  core  set  of \naccounting  (general  ledger)  cash  management  systems  built  around  the  SAP  R34  software \nplatform at the local level.  \n \n18. \nThe  controller  general  of  accounts  is  planning  to  upgrade  the  district  account  offices \n(DAOs)  and  tehsil  account  offices  by  posting  relatively  senior  personnel  and  upgrading  their \nstatus  from  treasuries  to  DAOs  and  subtreasuries  to  tehsil  account  offices.  This  will  require \nhuman  resource  development  efforts  and  large  logistical  and  infrastructural  support.  The  first \nPIFRA  project  established  the  basic  system  for  reporting  of  transactions  consistent  with  the \n\n                                                 \n4 SAP R3 is a management, accounting, and auditing software from SAP, a German business application software \n\ncompany. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nGFS  classification  and  chart  of  accounts.  PIFRA  is  supporting  the  infrastructure  and  human \nresource  development  for  the  DAOs  where  the  new  accounting  model  is  going  to  be \nimplemented. The pilot phase of PIFRA (through to 30 September 2001) focused on 13 different \nimplementation sites, which will be expanded to 38 sites by 30 December 2002. Replication to \nall  districts  is  scheduled  to  occur  by  31  December  2003.  This  might  include  emphasis  on  the \ncapacity development of drawing and disbursing offices and/or extension of the computerization \nplan to the lower levels of government. \n \nExtension  of  New  Core  Fiscal  Management  Systems.  Early  on,  the  National \n19. \nReconstruction  Bureau  (NRB)  recognized  the  need  for  new  core  systems  in  such  areas  as \nrevenue,  fiscal  transfers,  budgeting,  accounting,  procurement,  performance  management,  and \nauditing. Since June 2001, new systems have been designed, for which training is beginning at \nthe  district,  tehsil,  and  union  levels.  These  include  local  development  and  current  services \nbudgeting,  fiscal  transfers,  accounting,  auditing,  and  revenue  systems.  It  is  important  to \nrecognize that most of these core systems are based on preexisting systems at the provincial \nlevel. This is a major advantage of the Government decentralization program in that the systems \nhave  already  functioned,  albeit  producing  poor  results  from  allocational  and  operational \nperspectives. Thus, implementation will require continued modification and modernization of the \nprovincial  systems,  e.g.,  from  input-  and  control-oriented  budgeting  to  output-  and  results- \noriented budgeting with maximum managerial discretion. \n \nB. \n\n \nIssues in Future Design and Implementation \n\n1. \n\nContextual Issues \n\n20. \nPolitical/Economic  Instability.  As  indicated,  to  some  extent  the  decentralization \nprogram was a response to the risks of widespread political instability related to poor provincial \ndelivery  of  local  service  or  services  reasonably  expected  by  local  residents.  This  prompted \naction  by  the  President  and  NRB.  Decentralization  now  must  be  implemented  in  the  same \nunstable  context,  through  a  new  tier  of  government  with  newly  designed  systems  and  mostly \nborrowed staff, which will be an important institutional challenge. NRB and successor agencies \nmust  balance  the  need  to  reduce  centralization  of  control  (which  remains  from  the  provincial \nlevel  and  is  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  center)  with  greater  regulation  of  local \nofficials (to ensure accountability and responsiveness to voters and residents beyond their own \npersonal  and  group  needs).  Put  another  way,  the  Government  needs  to  shift  the  current \nemphasis  from  command  and  control  by  provinces  of  local  units  to  regulation  of  delegated \nfunctions  through  systems  of  incentives  for  achievement  of  service  targets.  Successful \ninstitutional reorientation will require political and economic stability.  \n \n21. \nThe  majority  of  elected  councilors  are  new  in  politics.  However,  the  composition  of  the \ncouncils  reflects  social  and  class  hierarchy  that  already  exists  in  the  society.  There  is  a  clear \nclass divide between the mayors and deputy mayors, and general councilors. Nazims (mayors) \nof  UCs  as  well  as  district  councils  belong  to  dominant  classes  and  influential  families,  while \nnearly  50%  of  the  council  members  come  from  the  marginalized  social  categories  \u2013  women, \npeasants,  and  workers.  Since  the  majority  of  councilors  who  have  been  elected  to  reserved \nseats  have  entered  into  formal  local  politics  for  the  first  time,  they  lack  political  training  and \nskills. The vast majority of councilors in special seats belong to neither political parties nor civil \nsociety  organizations.  They  are  not  organized  and  do  not  have  a  collective  voice  to  affect  the \ndecision-making  processes  of  their  councils.  In  the  initial  phase  of  the  functioning  of  local \ngovernments, it is evident that nazims have the tendency to act as patriarchs and undermine the \nparticipatory  process  that  is  fundamental  to  the  spirit  of  decentralization  by  taking  unilateral \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Appendix 3 \n \n \n\n \n\n47\n\ndecisions  without  involving  and  engaging  the  councilors  in  council  matters.  The  council \nsessions,  particularly  at  the  UC  level,  are  not  convened  regularly  as  stated  in  the  Local \nGovernment Ordinance (LGO), and issues are not debated exhaustively enough. Exclusionary \nand  nonparticipatory  planning  and  budgetary  processes  have  already  generated  a  sense  of \npowerlessness and frustration among councilors, especially among those who are representing \ndisadvantaged  sections  of  the  society,  which  is  articulated  through  frequent  walkouts  from \ncouncil meetings. The continuing social divisions within the councils may lead to destabilization \nof the political dimension of local government. \n \n22. \nThe  nature  of  bureaucracy  in  Pakistan  is  another  barrier  in  forging  a  new  relationship \nbetween the executive and political branches of the administration. The bureaucracy had been \nenjoying  complete  control  and  power  over  the  instrumentalities  of  state  institutions  since  the \nindependence of the country. Bureaucracy inherited centralized control, arrogance, and tradition \nfrom  the  preindependence  era,  when  the  colonial  power  delegated  a  great  deal  of  power  to \ndistrict administrators. The Decentralization Plan shifts and reshapes the authority and power of \nthe  bureaucracy  by  way  of  making  it  accountable  to  elected  public  representatives.  The \nbureaucracy  is  known  for  its  opposition  and  resistance  to  this  new  devolved  system  of  local \ngovernance.  The  continuing  tension  between  officials  and  local  representatives,  and  the \nnonresponsiveness and resistance of the former to the demands of changing relationships is a \nfurther deterrent to the development of effective local government institutions. \n \n23. \nCitizens  have  the  central  role  to  play  in  the  success  of  the  local  government  system. \nThey are the primary stakeholders whose vested interests to improve their living conditions and \naccess to public goods and services is dependent on the success of the new system. Their level \nof  political  consciousness  will  be  a  key  factor  in  determining  people\u2019s  participation  in  local \ngovernance structures. Low investment in community-based organizations and local committees \nto empower them to hold the local institution accountable will not yield desired results \n \n24.  Most of the proposed support for decentralization reforms requires sequenced activities, \nwhich,  if  interrupted  by  political  crises,  could  result  in  loss  of  program  momentum.  Ideally, \npolitical  stability  and  continuing  support  will  remain  during  the  implementation  of  modern \ndecentralization reforms. A fear of NRB from the very outset of the decentralization was reversal \nof reforms (recentralization) by later political (i.e., not self-appointed) governments. The latter is \nunlikely to occur now. The former can be remedied through design innovations in the program, \ne.g., entry and exit triggers, and flexibility to modify delivery of activities and achieve targets.  \n \nIn  addition,  weak  macroeconomic  performance  owing  in  part  to  the  effects  of  11 \n25. \nSeptember  2001  on  trade,  investment,  tourism,  and  international  communications  are \ncombining to reduce available revenues to finance the decentralization program, either through \nborrowing  or  direct  expenditures.  There  is  little  macroeconomic  space  for  the  decentralization \nprogram. Additional political instability, e.g., through threats of war with India, can only reduce \nthe macroeconomic space further. This will continue as a major risk. It is therefore important to \nconsider  the  effects  of  political/economic  instability  on  future  implementation  plans  of  the \ndecentralization  program.  Technical  support  will  require  maximum  flexibility  and  the  ability  to \nprogram in learning from particular cases and experiences. \n \n26. \nEthnic and Geographic Diversity. The four provinces differ widely from one another in \nsocioeconomic  state,  level  of  local  institutional  development,  as  well  as  the  decision-making \ncapacities  of  both  local  and  provincial  institutions.  In  addition,  each  has  a  different  fiscal \nsituation,  including  debt  service  burdens.  Provincial  variation  will  affect  the  implementation \nprogress of the decentralization. The diversity will affect the pace and scope of reform.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n2. \n\nAdministrative Issues \n\nto \n\nrestructure \n\n27. \nStructural  Design  Issues.  It  is  important  to  clarify  key  structures  such  as  local \ngovernment  offices,  and  expenditure  and  revenue  assignments  among  tiers  of  government. \nPast  structural  design  weaknesses  led  to  poor  performance;  restructuring  is  necessary  to \nsupport  the  outcomes  of  the  decentralization  program,  i.e.,  without  reengineered  government \ndepartments  and  local  funds  it  cannot  work.  Structure  refers  to  the  networks  and  linkages  of \nroles and institutions in order to achieve planned objectives. Functions are clusters of activities \norganized to attain specific purposes. Structures affect how functions are performed.  \n \n28. \nDespite  legal  gaps,  restructuring  has  moved  forward.  As  noted,  responsibilities  of  the \ndistricts have not been codified in NRB\u2019s model LGO, which, with minor adjustments, has been \nadopted by all four provinces, while they are more clearly spelled out for tehsils (Article 54) and \nUCs  (Article  76).    Thus,  to  determine  the  district  expenditure  role,  one  must  deduce  the \nassignments  through  an  examination  of  2001-2002  district  budgets  and  the  organizational \ncharts  as  promulgated  by  NRB.  Districts  are  mainly  responsible  for  delivering  human  capital \nservices,  while  tehsils,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  UCs,  are  responsible  for  municipal  functions. \nClearly,  the  assignments  are  still  in  process.  For  example,  water  and  sanitation  agencies  will \ncome under the direction of the tehsil councils from the beginning of FY2003.  In addition, tehsil \nschools  and  their  teachers  have  still  to  be  transferred  to  the  district,  which  should  happen  by \nFY2003.  Most  provinces  have  moved  ahead \ntheir  departments  and \ninterorganizational  relationships  to  improve  performance.  NWFP,  for  example,  has  already \nrestructured 26 departments, including downsizing of 6000 staff after merging departments, and \nclosing autonomous bodies and specialized agencies. The lessons learned and methodologies \napplied  will  next  be  applied  to  local  governments.    Local  restructuring,  however,  can  proceed \nonly so far regardless of lessons learned from the provinces. The potential bottleneck for reform \nis a civil service that is beyond the control of the district, tehsil, and UC to control through the \nability  to  hire  and  fire.  At  present,  civil  servants  are  provincial  employees  (and  \u201cpaid\u201d  by  the \nprovinces  out  of  district  budgets),  and  will  remain  so  until  at  least  July  2003.  This  creates  a \nconcern that if the district does not take over the civil service (and create a district civil service \ncadre), the civil servants may not be committed to effective district governance.  \n  \n \n29. \nA  similarly  murky  relationship  exists  between  local  government  tiers,  such  as  districts \nand tehsils.  A district may make grants to the tehsils; however, again, there is no requirement \nto do so. Nor is there a set formula once the decision is made to make a grant. The 2000-2001 \ndivision of the UIPT between provinces and predecentralization urban bodies, when applied in \n2001-2002,  means  that  tehsils  (the  new  recipients  of  the  UIPT)  receive  about  80%  of  the  \ndistrict-collected  UIPT  (the  other  20%  goes  to  the  province).  So,  as  in  the  provincial-district \nfiscal  relationship,  there  seems  to  be  an  implicit  district-tehsil  fiscal  hierarchy.    Finally,  UC \noperational  funds  are  derived  from  various  own  fees  and  licenses  plus  a  flow  from  a  district \nAnnual  Development  Fund.    If  decentralization  is  to  proceed  in  a  well-designed  manner,  the \nprocess of these fiscal flows must become more transparent and certain. \n \nLocal political structures also need definition. Elected representatives feel powerless as \n30. \nthey  are  not  able  to  control  or  issue  orders  to  administrative  officials  over  fiscal  or  policy \nmatters.  This is partly because of an expectation gap and partly that they do not understand the \ndecision rules of the game, or their roles in exercising their powers while performing their duties.  \nThe  decentralization  program  will  require  effective  and  massive  communication  campaigns  to \nundo cultural norms inconsistent with decentralization and to clarify the roles and responsibilities \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      Appendix 3 \n \n \n\n \n\n49\n\nof  all  stakeholders  in  the  new  regime.    It  will  increase  stakeholder  capacity  to  voice  their \nconcerns in a timely, organized, and effective manner \n \n31. \nSystems  Design  Issues.  Issues  remain  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  core \nadministrative  and  political  systems.  In  the  political  realm,  relationships  between  nazims, \ncouncils, and female representatives; local governments and citizens; and higher and lower tiers \nof government have yet to be clarified. In the administrative policy-making area, core systems \nfor  fiscal  transfer,  procurement,  personnel  administration,  budgeting,  training,  and  revenues \nneed to be field-tested and modified to improve their performance. How political leaders relate \nto and use these systems to make decisions based on their information will powerfully affect the \nsuccess  of  the  decentralization  program.  This  is  normal  and  takes  time.  Training  modules  will \nhave to be upgraded to meet revised systemic requirements. \n \n32. \nThe  implementation  of  the  political  system  as  envisaged  under  the  LGO  2001  is  in \nprocess.  Nazims  and  councils  have  been  elected  at  all  local  government  levels,  but  other \nstructures are mostly not in place.  The committees of the council such as accounts committee, \nmonitoring committee, justice (insaaf) committee, and budget committee are in most places yet \nto be established and operationalized.  (In places, focus is shifted to street-light committees, etc. \nnot envisaged in the law).  The rules of business and power delegated to these committees are \nnot clear.  The business of local government is mainly being performed by the nazim, being the \nchief  executive  of  the  jurisdiction.    So  the  political  power  delegated  to  the  local  level  is  not \nshared  among  political  constituents,  resulting  in  lesser  participation,  transparency,  and \nmonitoring.  \n \nThe  most  extensive  fiscal  management  system  being  implemented  is  for  local \n33. \naccounting,  reporting,  and  control.  This,  as  noted  above,  is  called  PIFRA.  Because  this  has \nbeen  implemented  elsewhere  with  substantial  difficulty,  cost  overruns,  and  major  unintended \nconsequences,  there  are  important  technical  issues  here  that  need  to  be  discussed  in  an \nenvironment of learning (rather than immediate rule-making or final systems design). The issues \nare as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nComplexity.  Most  local  systems  are  manual,  and  it  is  critical  that  the  new \ncomputerized  system  be  designed  to  provide  a  bridge  between  the  entries  and \npractices  that  exist  in  the  new  system.  It  is  not  clear  from  interviews  at  the \nprovincial  and  local  levels  that  this  is  the  case.  The  system  is  adapted  from \ncommercial use (i.e., private firms) and works best at recording transactions that \nensure  macroeconomic  controls  and  fiscal  balance.  It  is  less  successful  at  the \nallocational  (sector  strategic  planning)  and  operational  (daily  service  delivery \nneeds)  levels  of  budgeting.  The  human  resources  required  to  operate  this \nsoftware  are  not  easily  available  in  the  local  market.    Provincial  information \ntechnology  (IT)  departments  have  moved  ahead  on  their  own  to  design  other \nsystems and networks that may or may not be consistent with PIFRA. Needed is \na  simple,  user-friendly  system  (possibly  a  simplified  version  of  the  accounting \ntechnology) that district, tehsil, and union officials can utilize to feed in data to the \nlarger SAP R3 system. \n\n(ii) \n\nFunctionality.  To  date,  the  interest  of  the  Government  has  been  accurate \nreporting  consistent  with  basic  elements  in  the  charts  of  accounts  that  can  be \nreconciled  quickly  and  registered  in  the  single  treasury  account.  This  is  normal \nfor  early  stages  of  decentralization  and  consistent  with  normative  centralization \nrequired for success. To implement the \u201coperational decentralization\u201d part of the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n \n\n \n\ndecentralization equation, it is essential that the SAP R3 system permit entry of \ndata  for  related  functions  beyond  accounting  in  performance  budgeting,  payroll, \nprocurement,  cost  accounting, \ninvestment  or  development  budgeting, \nperformance  management,  taxation,  and  land  use  management.  Provinces \nreport  that  to  permit  simplicity,  this  level  of  functionality  may  have  been  turned \noff, inhibiting future expansion of the system to meet local decision requirements \nnecessary  for  improved  performance.  Improved  coordination  and  understanding \nof  local  information  needs  can  facilitate  modification  in  the  implementation  of \nSAP  to  permit  future  expansion  of  functionality.  Use  of  alternative  software \nsystems  at  the  subprovince  level,  e.g.,  Free  Balance,  Inc.  (Canada),  and  Sun \nSystems  (United  Kingdom),  can  avoid  this  problem  in  some  cases  and  such \nsolutions need to be kept on the agenda and explored. \n\nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  Decision-making  roles  for  monitoring/evaluation \nof  implementation  progress  remain  unclear  between  levels  of  local  government \nand between local governments and provinces in particular areas. One of those \nareas is financial management information systems and IT where decisions such \nas  centralization  vs.  decentralization  and  ownership  of  systems  and  data  may \nbecome constraints to successful implementation. It is apparent that the contoller \ngeneral  of  accounts  is  the  implementing  agency  for  PIFRA,  as  is  charged \nconstitutionally  with  ensuring  accurate  and  auditable  accounting  data  (for  local \ndecisions  and  auditor  general  audits).  It  is  also  apparent  that  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  utilizes  a  working  group  that  meets  periodically  on  technical  and \ninstitutional  matters  pertaining  to  PIFRA  and  IT  projects.  The  Decentralization \nSupport Program learned, however, that provincial communications remain weak \nand that the possibility of inconsistent design and implementation remains high. It \nis  important  that  this  institutional  and  systemic  issue  be  addressed  with \nclarification of roles and requirements for participation prior to decisions on large \nsystems  such  as  PIFRA,  the  National  Reconstruction  Information  Management \nSystems, and provincial automation.  A better institutional mechanism can be a \nsource  of  achieving  enormous  synergies  and  simplicity  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of such systems.   \n\nCapacity-Building  Issues.  While  technical  capacities  remain  low  at  the  new \nlocal tier of government, district governments have acquired significantly greater \nresponsibilities  under  decentralization.    For  example,  education  is  a  labor- \nintensive service, and which level of government controls the personnel function \nby  and  large  defines  whether  education  is  decentralized  or  not.    Under \ndecentralization, the responsibility for paying and managing teachers clearly lies \nat  the  level  of  the  district,  even  though  teacher  pay  levels  and  teacher \neducational requirements are set nationally. This is a significant change from the \npredecentralization  arrangement,  under  which  provincial  governments  managed \nand paid teachers. \n\n \n\n\f.:,)~\n\nt'::;'\\\\\"'.\\':::'\\ \"\n\n~./ \n\n~ \n\ni.,~:\\\n\n~~\n\nAppendix 4\n\n51\n\nISLAMABAD\n\nDEVELOPMENT  POLICY  LETTER\n\n16  September  2002\n\nSHAUKATAZIZ\nMinister for Finance\n& Economic Affairs\n\nMr.  Tadao  Chino\nPresident\nAsian  Development  Bank\n\nManila,  Philippines\n\nDear  Mr.  Chino,\n\ntaking  office \n\nin  October  1999, \n\nthe  present  government \n\nlaunched  a\nShortly  after \nthat  seeks  to  achieve  sustained.  pro-poor  growth  by  attacking\ncomprehensive  program \nthe  social  gap  and  the  heavy\nthe  inter-linked  problems  of  slow  growth,  poor governance, \nthe\nto \ndebt  burden.

On  the  one  hand,  they  aim\nto  improve  political  representation  of  all  sectors  of  society  in  local  governance.

made  of  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  reforms \nencompassed by the Decentralization Support Program (DSP) on the basis of two approaches. \nThe first, the conventional approach, defines adjustment costs in terms of actual resource costs \nfrom  the  budget  viewpoint  of  local  governments  and  provinces  (here  termed  the  \"economic\" \ncosts).  The  second  approach  acknowledges  that  decentralization  is  a  federally  initiated  policy \nand program, and that the key fiscal reforms will adversely impact on the Federal budget (here \ntermed  the  \"fiscal\"  cost).  The  latter  remains  an  important  consideration:  First,  budgetary \nconstraints  can  hamper  the  implementation  of  the  decentralization  reform.  Second,  the  reform \nhas  primarily  been  a  creation  of  institutional  arrangements  and  capacities  at  the  local  level  in \naddition  to  decentralization  of  functions  and  staff  to  the  local  governments  and,  further,  at  the \npresent, provincial functions have remained in place.  Given that most of these costs are to be \nmet  from  fiscal  transfers  from  the  Federal  Government,  these  increased  resources  are  being \nmoved with the rationale of meeting the costs of implementation of decentralization.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  first,  an  economic  cost  estimate  approach,  entails  assumptions  about  (i)  costs  of \ninfrastructure for commissioning of new offices provided for in the Local Government Ordinance \n(LGO)  2001;  (ii)  costs  associated  with  modifying  (institutional  restructuring/reorientation, \ncapacity  building  and  creation  of  new  offices)  agencies  responsible  for  local  government \nfunctions at provincial and local levels; (iii) expenditure on development of allied systems (such \nas  data  systems)  for  the  improved  service  delivery  outcomes  on  which  rests  the  legitimacy  of \nthe  entire  reform;  and  (iv)  short-term  supplementation  of  local  government    funds  (budgetary \npools)  to  provide  much  needed  fiscal  space  for  discretionary  budget  and  expenditure \nmanagement  by  newly  elected  councils  ahead  of  full  implementation  of  Province  Finance \nCommission  transfer  systems  and  more  effective  local  revenue  mobilization.  Cost  estimates \nreflect detailed analysis made in association with the intensive province and local government \nlevel activities of the Fiscal Decentralization (FD) technical assistance (TA) (TA3621-PAK). Net \ncost  centers  are  grouped  in  five  categories,  and  disaggregated  and  summarized  as  in  Table \nA6.1.  Another  calculation  has  been  carried  out  by  a  subcommittee  of  the  National  Finance \nCommission  (NFC)  for  estimation  of  costs  of  decentralization.  The  results  of  this  calculation \nhave also been used for ascertaining the costs of infrastructure requirements.   \n \n\nTable A6.1: Cost Estimate Summary \u2013 3 years \n\nDistricts \n\nPRs in Million \n\nPRs in Million \n(Subtotal) \n\nUS$ in Million \n(Subtotal) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n2 \n \n3 \n \n\n4 \n5 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDistricts \n   Infrastructure \nTMA \n   Infrastructure \nHardware \n   For district \n   For TMA \nTraining \nSurvey \nService delivery management \ninformation systems \n   Revenue mobilization-district \n\n1,296.400 \n \n448.500 \n \n960.000 \n1,348.000 \n \n \n192.000 \n\n288.000 \n\n1,296.400 \n \n448.500 \n \n \n2,308.000 \n1,033.100 \n \n \n\n \n\n21.61 \n \n7.45 \n \n \n38.47 \n17.22 \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDistricts \n\nPRs in Million \n\nPRs in Million \n(Subtotal) \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n7  \n \n \n8 \n9 \n10 \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n12 \n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n   Revenue mobilization-tehsil     \nDatabase \n   For province \n   For districts \nNazims (mayor) office \n   Zila (district) nazim \n   Tehsil nazim \nZila council \nTehsil council \nProvincial Institutions \n   LGC \n   PFC \nInvestments to strengthen local \nservice delivery \n   District \n\n   TMA \n   UA \nKhushal Pakistana \nCompetency focussed technical \nassistance \nTotal Cost \n\n1,011.000 \n \n300.000 \n288.000 \n \n288.000 \n404.400 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2,880.000 \n\n2,022.000 \n9,033.000 \n4,500.000 \n \n\n1,491.000 \n \n \n588.000 \n \n \n692.400 \n489.600 \n808.800 \n \n17.664 \n13.008 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n13,935.000 \n4,500.000 \n122.000 \n\nUS$ in Million \n(Subtotal) \n24.85 \n \n \n9.80 \n \n \n11.54 \n8.16 \n13.48 \n \n0.29 \n0.22 \n \n\n \n\n \n232.25 \n75.00 \n2.04 \n\n462.39 \n\n15,667.000 \n\n27,743.372 \n\nLGC  =  local  government  commission,  PFC  =  province  finance  commission,  TMA  =  tehsil  (subdistrict)  municipal \nadministration, UA = union administration. \na Khushal Pakistan is the national public works and employment generating program. \nSource: Mission Calculations based on Ministry of Finance Statistics and fieldwork. \n \n \n\n1. \n\nCosts of New Institutions \n\n \n3. \nNew institutions are being established at the provincial (Local Government Commission, \nProvince  Finance  Commission)  and  local  level.  The  costs  for  the  commissions  will  include \nexpenditures on surveys and studies for collection of data to enable them to function optimally. \nAt the district level, of a total of 14 offices, 9 will be new. These institutions include not only the \ndistrict  level  offices  with  departmental  mandates  but  also  the  offices  of  district  ombudsman, \ninternal auditor (to be brought into existence under the amendments promulgated to LGOs 2001 \nin  June  2002)  and  political  bodies,  zila  (district)  council,  and  their  monitoring  committees.  The \nlatter  two  will  need  secretariats  to  be  established.  In  certain  tehsils  (subdistrict)  and  all  the \ntowns, new office establishments are required. Union offices are available in most cases, but in \nSindh and Balochistan more than half the union administrations do not have offices.  \n \nFor  purposes  of  calculating  infrastructure  costs,  districts  in  each  province  have  been \n4. \ndivided into three categories: (i) Category A districts are those that were formerly the divisional \nheadquarters and are therefore well furnished with personnel, infrastructure, and equipment; (ii) \nCategory  B  districts  are  those  that  have  historically  functioned  as  such  and  are  therefore \nadequately furnished with personnel, infrastructure, and equipment; and (iii) Category C districts \nwere created in the recent past and are underfurnished with respect to infrastructure, personnel, \nand equipment. In case of the NFC calculations, the number of offices has been calculated, and \nunit  costs  have  been  attributed  to  them  based  on  the  standard  government  staffing  and \ninfrastructure patterns, but vary according to the structure of offices. These are given in Table \nA6.2.  As  part  of  the  deliberations  of  NFC,  costs  on  this  count  have  been  calculated  to  be \nPRs15.29 billion ($259 million). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n                                             Appendix 6            \n67\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProvince \n\n \nBalochistan \nNWFP \nPunjab \nSindh \nTotal  \n \n\nTable A6.2:  Province and Local Government Offices \n\nTotal number of offices \nrequired \n\nNumber of offices \navailable/modified \n\nNumber offices to be \ncreated anew \n\nProvince \n0 \n33 \n30 \n32 \n95 \n\nDG \n1158 \n1058 \n1794 \n2237 \n6248 \n\nProvince \n0 \n30 \n25 \n24 \n79 \n\nDG \n601 \n430 \n796 \n1177 \n3004 \n\nProvince \n0 \n3 \n5 \n8 \n16 \n\nDG \n557 \n629 \n998 \n1060 \n3244 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Modification Costs \n\n \n5. \nMost of the offices in the local governments have been created with modifications in the \nstaffing of earlier field offices of the provincial departments. These are the former offices of the \nprovincial  departments,  which  existed  at  the  district  level  and  now  form  part  of  the  district \ngovernment. Of 14 district government offices, 5 fall in this category. The Decentralization Plan \nenvisages that the district offices should be staffed by officers of specified seniority (BS-20 for \ndistrict  council  officers  and  BS-19  for  executive  development  officers)  to  enable  sufficient \nexperience  for  these  nascent  local  governments.  This  will  have  the  advantage  of  appropriate \nlevel  of  interaction  with  the  Provincial  heads  of  department  (Province  Secretaries  are  BS-20). \nDue to unavailability of officers in appropriate grades in many local governments, junior grade \nofficers  have  been  given  the  assignments.  For  the  calculation  of  costs  it  is  assumed  that  the \npositions  will  be  filled  in  due  course  of  time  by  the  designated  seniority  officers.  The  salary \ndifferential has been calculated and reflected in the costs (see Table A6.1).  \n \n\n3. \n\nSystems Costs \n\n \n6. \nExisting as well as new offices require new systems for their functioning in accordance \nwith  the  decentralized  arrangements.  This  includes  formulation  of  laws  and  regulations, \nadministrative procedures, reskilling of staff for their operation, reequipping, and retooling, etc.  \n(see Table A6.1). \n \n\n4. \n\nData Systems Costs  \n\n \nLocal level data systems are not developed and in many cases are almost non-existent. \n7. \nData  systems  required  for  supporting  decisions  and  planning  need  to  be  developed.  These \nrange  from  fiscal  condition  surveys,  baselines  on  service  outputs  and  endowments,  to  basic \ninfrastructure status surveys (see Table A6.1).  \n \n\n5. \n\nCapacity Building Costs \n\n \n8. \nBased  on  experience  with  the  FD  TA,  reliable  estimates  can  be  made  of  (i)  technical \nassistance  required  by  provinces  and  local  governments  to  refine  and  fully  articulate \ndecentralized  systems,  and  (ii)  the  requirement  to  build  basic  functional  capacities  of \nadministrative  and  political  officials  at  the  provincial  and  local  levels.  TA  requirements \ncorrespond  to  the  11  thematic  areas  identified  for  support  under  the  TA  loan  for  Local \nGovernment  Performance  Enhancement  (TA1)  and  the  TA  loan  for  Gender  and  Governance \nMainstreaming  (TA2).  Functional  capacity  building  refers  to  10  clusters  of  training  modules \nrequired  (e.g.,  for  budget  management,  citizen  community  boards,  fiscal  transfers,  quality \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n68 \n\n \n\nFederal Revenue Impact Estimates \n\nservices  and  standards,  etc.)  to  be  implemented  over  the  next  3  years.    Based  on  the  FD TA \ntraining  experience  an  estimated  PRs1,033  million  ($17.22  million)  will  be  required  for \ncompetency-focused capacity building.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe second approach focuses on the impact of revenue losses borne by the Federation \nand  entails  assumptions  about  (i)  intergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring  to  provide  adequate \nrevenues to the local governments through awards of the National Finance Commission (NFC); \nand (ii) judgements about the extent to which additional expenditure obligations will be passed \nfrom  the  Federal  to  the  provincial  to  the  local  government  level  as  part  of  decentralization \nreforms,  either  as  a  result  of  negotiations  around  the  NFC  award,  or  as  a  consequence  of \nintergovernmental restructuring proposals yet to be announced by the National Reconstruction \nBureau.  \n \n\n1. \n\nIntergovernmental  Fiscal  Restructuring:  Favorable  Revenue  Sharing  for \nLocal Governments  \n\n \n10. \nThere  is  a  marked  vertical  imbalance  in  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations.  Currently  in \nsession,  it  is  anticipated  that  NFC  will  partially  correct  this,  and  make  a  favorable  award  to \nprovide  adequate  revenues  to  provinces,  from  where  they  will  be  shared  with  local \ngovernments. The current formula, which awards 62.5% to the Federal Government and 37.5% \nto the provinces, is expected to shift towards 50:50 shares, and changes are also expected in \nthe inter-province sharing formula. Though it is clear the NFC award will cause revenue loss for \nthe Federal Government, the timing of announcement is uncertain. As an interim measure, as a \nresult of policy dialogue with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (see Appendix 4), the Federal \nGovernment has agreed to transfer 2.5% of the additionality of the general sales tax (GST) to \nthe local governments. The gross revenue impact on the Federal Government of this measure, \nover 3 years, is approximately PRs76.5 billion, as can be ascertained from Table A6.1 (row 6, \nTotals  of  FY2003-2005).  While  reflecting  official  government  projections,  annual  increment  in \nGST revenue (22% per annum) is perhaps optimistic. A more realistic rate of increase may be \nestimated at 15% per annum, which gives an estimated revenue impact of PRs71.5 billion. The \nFederal Government has also, as a result of the ADB negotiations relating to the DSP, agreed \nto continue the Decentralization Transition Grant for a year (FY2003). This has been budgeted \nas Rs1 billion. In the preceding year (FY2002) it was PRs3 billion.  \n \n\nTable A6.3: Projected General Sales Tax Transfers to Province/Local Governments \n(PRs in billions) \n \n\n2003 \n208.0 \n10.4 \n197.6 \n32.9 \n12.4 \n20.5 \n\n2004 \n254.4 \n12.7 \n241.7 \n40.3 \n15.1 \n       25.2 \n\n2005 \n\n311.2 \n15.6 \n295.6 \n49.3 \n18.5 \n30.8 \n\n2006 \n380.5 \n19.0 \n361.5 \n60.2 \n22.6 \n37.6 \n\n2007 \n465.4 \n23.3 \n442.1 \n73.7 \n27.6 \n46.1 \n\n \n\n \n1  General Sales Tax \n2  Less collection charges (5%) \n3  Net General Sales Tax (GST) \n4  2.5% Net GST \n5  Provincial Share (37.5%) \n6  Federal Share (62.5%) \n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n                                             Appendix 6            \n69\n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nReassignment of Expenditure Obligations, Termination of Subsidies \n\n \n11. \nTwo reassignments need to be considered. First, the agreement to transfer 2.5% GST to \nlocal  governments  concludes  an  earlier  agreement,  following  abolition  of  the  octroi  and  zila \ntaxes in 1998. In place of these taxes, the Federal Government instituted a replacement grant, \nwhich in FY2002 stood at just over PRs7 billion. This has been terminated in FY2003. It is not \nentirely clear whether the Government would have indexed the replacement grant in the future, \nbut for estimation purposes it is held at PRs7 billion for FY2004 and FY2005. (The effects of this \ntapering  grant  have  been  included  in  the  estimation  of  net  impact  of  the  GST  transfer  above, \nassuming that this would have remained constant for the program period). \n \n12. \nSecond,  and  more  difficult  to  reliably  judge,  the  Federal  Government  has  terminated \nspending  on  the  Khushal  Pakistan  Program  (KPP),1  a  transitory  social  intervention  aimed  at \ngenerating  economic  activity  through  public  works.  Whereas  a  budget  allocation  of  PRs19.5 \nbillion was made in FY2001, this declined to PRs7 billion in FY2002 and has been dropped from \nthe  federal  budget  in  FY2003.  While  speculative,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  PRs4.5  billion \nwould  have  been  included  in  the  FY2003  budget,  reflecting  a  gradual  phasing  out  of  the \nProgram, had not the 2.5% GST been returned to local governments.  \n \n13. \nTaking  into  account  the  assumptions  of  paras.  3-8,  the  federal  revenue  impact  of \ndecentralization  reforms  over  3  years  of  DSP  is  PRs51.0  billion,  or  $849.6  million  as  in  Table \nA6.4. However, by taking less a optimistic scenario of annual increase in GST revenues, at 15% \nper annum (para. 11) the federal revenue impact is PRs46 billion, or $766.7 million.  \n \n\nTable A6.4: Estimated Net Revenue Impact on Federation of Decentralization Reforms  \n(PRs in billions) \n \n\n \n\nFederal Share (62.5%) \n(at 22% increase in GST) \nOctroi/Zila Tax \nKhushal PP \nNet Estimate \n\nUS Dollar values ($\u2019mills) \n\n150.0 \n\n2002-03 \n20.5 \n\n2002-04 \n\n       25.2 \n\n(7.0) \n(4.5) \n9.0 \n\n(7.0) \n- \n18.2 \n\n303.0 \n\n \n\n2004-05 \n30.8 \n\n(7.0) \n- \n23.8 \n\n396.6 \n\nTotals \n76.5  \n\n(21.0) \n(4.5) \n51.0 \n\n849.6 \n\n3. \n\nCost of Transition to Formula Based Transfers \n\n \n14. \nThe  local  governments  have  operated  on  discretionary  grants  from  the  province.  With \ndecentralization,  new  expenditure  responsibilities  have  been  assigned  to  them  from  the \nprovince.  In  the  transition  arrangements  the  transfers  have  been  designed  to  provide  the \nbaseline  expenditures.  The  currently  announced  formula-based  transfer  systems  have  also \nadopted a minimalist approach to support the baseline expenditures. The differences in these, \nemerging from the years of discretion-based allocations, are given in Supplementary Appendix \nB.  Once  these  graduate  to  formula-based  transfers,  the  baseline  expenditures  will  need  an \nupward or downward adjustment depending upon the formula adopted. To prevent large-scale \ndisruptions in service delivery systems in the local governments, the shift to formal-based grants \nwill need setting up of transition grants to provide assistance to local governments, which face a \nstark  downward  revision  in  their  shares,  to  provide  them  a  predictable  time  period  for \n                                                 \n1KPP \nin \n\nsummarized \n\nReduction \n\nStrategy \n\nPoverty \n\nInterim \n\nPaper, \n\nthe \n\nat \n\nis \n\nhttp://www.imf.org/External/NP/prsp/2001/pak/01. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n70 \n\n \n\nEstimates of Adjustment Costs \n\nadjustment.  This  grant  will  be  a  cost  to  be  supported  by  Federal  or  provincial  governments. \nKeeping  in  view  the  large  differentials  in  the  local  government  baseline  expenditure \ncommitments it can be argued that this grant will need to be of a size of PRs3 billion over the \nperiod of adjustment (3 years). The calculations can be finalized once the interim awards of the \nPFCs are succeeded by the 3-year statutory awards. Given the uncertainty of this cost, it has \nbeen excluded from the fiscal cost calculations. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nReliable estimates of Federal adjustment costs will depend on the NFC award outcome, \nexpected  to  be  announced  during  2002.  Ahead  of  this,  the  two  approaches  to  estimating \nadjustment costs provide a best proxy for estimation. An expenditure, economic cost estimate \napproach  indicates  an  adjustment  cost,  over  3  years  from  FY2003,  of  $462.39  million.  The \nrevenue  impact  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring  from  the  Federal  budget  viewpoint  is \nestimated at $766 million to $850 million.  \n \n \n \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n \nDSP Program  \n \nManagement Bodies \n\nDSP Executing/ \nImplementing Agencies \n\nKey PMU Functions \n\nExecuting Agencies \n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nFederal Program \nSupport Office \n\nImplementing Agencies (IAs) \n\nCoordination \n Committees \n\nFederal Steering \nCommittee \n\nFunctions: \n\u2022  Approve consolidate \nannual workplan & \nbudget \n\n\u2022  Validate progress & \nannual reports \n\n\u2022  Review performance of \n\nDSP loans \n\nMembership: \nExecuting & implementing  \nagencies \n\nFunctions: \n\u2022  Approve province \nannual workplan & \nbudget \n\n\u2022  Approve progress & \nannual reports \n\nMembership: \nProvincial departments  \nLocal governments \n \n\nNRB\n\nAuditor General \n\nController General of \nAccounts\n\nMinistry of Women's \nDevelopment/Social \nDevelopment \n\nLocal Governments\n\nTA2 Program \nSupport Offices \n\nSteering Committee\n\nProvincial Government\n\nProvincial PSO \n\nFederal & TA2 PMU: \n\u2022  Secretariat to Federal Program Steering Committee; \n\u2022  Prepare PCII for TA Loans \n\u2022  Prepare consolidated annual workplans & budgets \n\nfrom federal and provincial IAs; \n\n\u2022  Prepare consolidated progress & annual reports from \n\nfederal and provincial IAs; \n\n\u2022  Manage DSP Imprest Account and disburse funds to \n\nProvince Sub-Imprest Accounts against workplans; \n\u2022  Manage TA loans objects of expenditure at federal \nlevel against approved IA annual workplans & \nbudgets; \nLiaison & technical support implementing agencies; \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Manage conduct of annual external audit; \n\u2022  Monitor & evaluate DSP implementation & facilitate \n\nannual Performance Review process; \n\n\u2022  Supervise and provide technical assistance to \n\nprovincial PMUs \n\nProvince PMU: \n\u2022  Secretariat to Province Program Steering \n\nCommittee; \n\n\u2022  Prepare consolidated annual workplans & \n\nbudgets from provincial IAs; \n\n\u2022  Prepare consolidated progress & annual reports \n\nfrom provincial IAs; \n\n\u2022  Manage Province Sub-Imprest Accounts and \n\ndisburse funds against workplans; \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Manage TA loans objects of expenditure at \nprovince level against approved IA annual \nworkplans & budgets; \nLiaison & technical support for province \ndepartments; \nFacilitate annual external audit; \nFacilitate Federal PMU monitoring & evaluation of \nDSP implementation & Annual Performance \nReview process\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n73\n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n \n1. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange expenditures for \nthe  reasonable  cost  of  imported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or  taxes)  required  during  the \nexecution  of  the  Decentralization  Support  Program.

The broad scope of activities to be supported under \nthis  TA  is  defined  by  the  policy  matrix  result  areas,  in  particular,  11  thematic  areas,  detailed \nbelow.  \n \n2. \nTA1 will be structured in four phases to provide the maximum flexibility and adaptation to \nprovincial and local circumstances and requirements over the life of the DSP. Phase I will be for \n12 months (July 2003 \u2013 June 2004); Phase II will also be for 12 months (July 2004\u2013June 2005). \nThis  will  be  followed  by  the  third  phase,  lasting  12  months  (July  2005\u2013June  2006).  A  final \nphase,  extending  beyond  the  life  of  the  program  loan,  is  scheduled  for  12  months  from  July \n2006 through June 2007.  \n \n3. \nThis Appendix outlines 11 thematic areas, corresponding to the result areas of the policy \nmatrix, and for each thematic area, proposes a list of priority activities for investments under the \nTA1 loan. These priority activities will be reviewed by the IAs during the inception phase of the \nDSP,  facilitated  by  the  program  support  offices  (PSOs)  at  the  Federal  and  provincial  level. \nModifications to this priority listing are expected, and encouraged, based on the priorities of IAs \nand their assessment of how best to use the TA resources, in light of existing commitments and \nexternally  supported  activities  already  underway.  IAs  may  judge  that  particular  thematic  areas \nare either well covered by other programs, or reflect areas in which they already have sufficient \ncompetency,  and  may  elect  to  focus  their  allocations  from  TA1  on  a  selection  of  the  thematic \nareas. \n \nThe  annual  work  plan  process  for  each  phase  will  be  conducted  in  tandem  with  the \n4. \nbudgetary  process.

For this purpose the provincial \nPSC  will  have  a  majority  of  membership  from  the  local  governments.  These  members  will  be \nequally drawn from the political executive and local administration. The political executive will be \nselected in a manner such that there is equivalence between the district governments and tehsil  \n(subdistrict)  municipal  administrations.  Selection  will  ensure  that  the  weaker  agencies  at  the \nprovincial  and  local  level  receive  a  fair  share  of  the  resources.    A  competitive  process  will  be \ncreated  wherein  well  developed  and  feasible  programs  are  favored.

Audit \n\nNarrative Summary \nAudit is an integral component of the overall \ngovernance framework. Certification of local \ngovernment accounts is also important from \nthe perspective of arriving at nation-wide \nconsolidated figures for the total public activity \nin a fiscal year. The Draft Local Government \n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2002 provides that \nthe Auditor General will certify the local \ngovernment accounts for District Governments \nand Tehsil / Town and UAs. This requires \nenormous increase in the resources of the \nOffice of the Auditor General and the efficient \nutilization of these resources.  \nPreviously accounting was seen as simply a \nrecord-keeping function, whereas it is \nincreasingly understood as an information-\nreporting tool.  The more disaggregated (e.g., \ngender disaggregated) and timely data is \ncaptured and reported by an accounting \nsystem the more useful management support \nit provides for decision-making and control \npurposes. Accounting systems are also \nrecognized as the key to increased \ntransparency and accountability.  \nIn Pakistan the accounts offices also perform \nthe functions of pre-audit, budgetary control \nand disbursements along with the accounts \nkeeping and reporting of financial information.  \nAccording to the recent decisions, CGA is \nresponsible for the maintenance of accounts of \nDistrict and Tehsil Governments through \nrespective DAOs and TAOs.  Fiscal \nDecentralization (FD) TA provided the system \n(LG Accounts Code) of account keeping for all \nthe local governments. This system will prevail \nuntil the PIFRA [SAP R/3] system replaces it, \nwhich may take two years in case of districts \nand five years in case of tehsils.   \nNation-wide and continuous efforts are \nrequired to reliably communicate to the public, \nelected officials and administrations the policy, \nlegal framework, institutional arrangements \nand results of decentralization. Requiring on-\ngoing national capacity, supporting provinces \nand local governments, through strategic \nmonitoring of the pace and lessons of reforms, \n(based on reliable, comparable data about \nlocal service delivery outcomes), so as to \nprogressively modify and refine key elements. \nFurther, nation-wide implementation is  \n\n \n\nInst.

Timely, \npredictable and transparent transfers will be an \nessential requirement for local fiscal stability. \nFor this purpose institutional capacity of the \nPFC, Finance Department and F&P Offices \nwill be targeted. Data systems for analysis and \nmonitoring of local fiscal conditions and design \nof formula options will support establishment of \nfiscal transfer mechanism that stabilizes local \nservice delivery.
