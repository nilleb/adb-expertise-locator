THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed  \nprogrammatic approach for the Fiscal Resilience and Social Protection Support Program, and (ii) \na proposed policy-based loan to Georgia for subprogram 1 of the Fiscal Resilience and Social \nProtection Support Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program is part of a comprehensive and integrated package of support from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Government of Georgia to help mitigate the adverse \nhealth, social, and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.2 The \nprogram supports Georgia\u2019s return to inclusive economic growth by addressing the longstanding \ninstitutional fragilities in social protection, fiscal, and debt management that were exacerbated by \nthe pandemic and require immediate response. The proposed policy actions are critical in dealing \nwith the economic impact of COVID-19 and ensuring macroeconomic stability in the medium to \nlong term, while continuing to protect the livelihoods of those most affected by the crisis. Delaying \nthe policy actions would expose the government to unplanned increases in the fiscal deficit \nbecause of fiscal risks that are more likely to materialize during the ongoing crisis, continued \naccumulation  of  foreign-currency-denominated  debt,  and  higher  exposure  to  currency  and \nrefinancing risks. At the same time, immediate reforms are needed to safeguard the well-being of \nolder adults, many of whom have lost some of their supplementary sources of income as a result \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy, \n2019\u20132023 for Georgia. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints  \n \n3.  Georgia\u2019s public health response broadly effective in containing spread of COVID-\n19. As of 29 September 2020, Georgia had confirmed 5,552 cases since the outbreak of COVID-\n19, with 2,054 recoveries and 32 fatalities.3 From the outset, the country imposed health checks \non incoming air passengers and ramped up restrictions on movement as the first cases emerged. \nThe government\u2019s clear and consistent communication strategy was instrumental in avoiding \nwidespread  contagion.  The  phased  lifting  of  lockdown  measures  was  underpinned  by \nrecommendations from health professionals to help prevent a resurgence of cases,4 and public \ncompliance with these recommendations kept the incidence low. Despite a sharp increase in the \nnumber of confirmed cases in September 2020, Georgia\u2019s number of confirmed cases remains \none of the lowest in the region and remains retain one of the lowest case-mortality rates among \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. \n \n4.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  a  significant  negative  impact  on  Georgia\u2019s \neconomy. While the drop in remittances and exports was less severe than initially envisioned, it \ndid not offset the adverse impact of a marked slowdown in the tourism industry and foreign direct \ninvestment. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth is now forecast to decelerate to \u20135.0% in \n2020.5 The revised projections are based on recent data indicating a contraction in growth of \n12.6% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2020, and an overall 5.8% contraction for the first \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Asian Development Outlook Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila.  ", "2 \nhalf of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, tourism revenues fell by $849 million year-over-year. \nThe impact of this on Georgia\u2019s external balance was partly offset by a reduced trade balance (\u2013\n$497  million  year-over-year)  as  imports  (\u201331.8%)  fell  more  than  exports  (\u201324.7%).6 Also, \nincoming remittances rebounded in June 2020 with a year-over-year increase of 17.8%, after \neconomic lockdowns across the globe had caused a sharp drop in April. The lari, which had hit a \nrecord low in March 2020, appreciated by 6.9% quarter-on-quarter against the United States \ndollar, reflecting adequate monetary policy responses by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), as \nwell as external funding support and resilient remittances. Annual inflation in June 2020 was 6.1%, \ndriven by food price increases because of supply chain disruptions and stronger influence of \nforeign exchange pass-through.7 \n \n5.  Impact on public finances more severe than expected. The COVID-19 pandemic \nsignificantly weakened Georgia\u2019s fiscal position.8 Revenue and grants are expected to decline by \n10.5% in the revised budget, compared with the original budget for 2020, led by a 12.1% drop in \ntax  revenues,  while  expenditure  is  expected  to  increase  by  10.2%.9 To  accommodate the \nsignificant increase in public expenditure needed to finance Georgia's Anti-Crisis Plan, the \ngovernment sought to create fiscal space in the revised budget 2020.10 Recurrent expenditure on \nwages and salaries was lowered by 2.7%, and on goods and services by 1.6%, compared with \nthe original 2020 state budget. But despite these efforts, the financing gap for 2020 widened to \n$1.6 billion, from an estimated $1.5 billion in May 2020 (footnote 9). To bridge this financing gap, \nexternal borrowing is expected to increase by an additional GEL4.3 billion, and domestic debt is \nset to rise by GEL649 million. Despite the lari\u2019s continued depreciation during 2014\u20132019, \nGeorgia's ratio of general government debt to GDP remained below 42% during 2017\u20132019. \nHowever, general government debt will increase sharply to 57.9% of GDP in 2020, from 41.2% in \n2019. While the authorities have a medium-term plan to gradually reduce government debt as a \nshare of GDP to 54.3% by 2024,11 rollover, currency, and contingency risks may disrupt this \ntrajectory (footnote 7). The fiscal deficit increased sharply to 8.5% in 2020, from 2.2% in 2019, \nwell above the 3.0% ceiling of the Economic Liberty Act.12  \n \n6.  External general government debt magnifying vulnerabilities to economic shocks.  \nDomestic markets in Georgia are not sufficiently liquid to fund the public financing needs entirely. \nTo  address  this  shortcoming,  the  government  is  seeking  foreign  currency  financing  from \ndevelopment partners to fund its ambitious countercyclical development expenditure program. As \na result, the share of foreign-currency-denominated government debt as a share of GDP in \nGeorgia is expected to increase from 31.5% in 2019 to 45.9% in 2020.13 This in turn increases \npublic exposure to foreign currency and refinancing risks.14 The rising costs of foreign-currency-\ndenominated debt repayments associated with depreciation of the lari may pose a significant \nburden  on  public  finances,  crowding  out  essential  social  spending  and  threatening \n \n6  National Bank of Georgia (NBG). 2020.

Tbilisi.  \n9  The tax\u2013GDP ratio will drop from 23% in the original 2020 budget to 21.4% in the revised budget.  \n10 The increase in expenditure was primarily led by a 28.6% increase in social benefit spending. \n11 The government plans to reduce government debt as a share of GDP to 55.9% in 2021, 55.9% in 2022, 55.4% in \n2023, and 54.3% in 2024. Ministry of Finance (MOF). 2020. Basic Economic and Financial Indicators (accessed 06 \nOctober 2020). \n12 The Economic Liberty Act, adopted in 2011 and effective since 2014, established numerical upper limits for general \ngovernment debt (60% of GDP), and the budget balance (3% of GDP). Public debt and budget balance rules have \nbeen adhered to since their introduction.. \n13 MOF. 2020.

", "3 \nmacroeconomic stability needed for economic recovery. Despite efforts to diversify the currency \ncomposition of the government debt portfolio, external debt accounts for roughly 80% of general \ngovernment debt, and most of that is denominated in United States dollars.15 The continued \nreliance on external and foreign-currency-denominated financing undermines efforts to deepen \ndomestic  debt  markets  and  increases  public  exposure  to  external  risks,  while  limiting  the \neffectiveness of countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies.  \n \n7.  Medium-term plan to narrow fiscal deficit. As a response to the sharp increase in the \nfiscal deficit in 2020, the authorities adopted a medium-term plan to gradually bring the fiscal \ndeficit below 3% by 2024.16 However, the risk of a protracted crisis may prompt the extension of \nthe temporary social protection measures and lead to lower growth and revenues in 2021 \n(footnote 8). This could create a need for more expenditure going into 2021 and, depending on \nhow global, regional, and domestic economic dynamics unfold, may slow the rebound in economic \nactivity and keep revenues below expectations. Higher than planned fiscal deficits in the medium \nterm could frustrate the government\u2019s plan to minimize its borrowing needs and, in the absence \nof deeper domestic markets, increase the exposure to refinancing and currency risks.17 It is \ntherefore imperative that the government continue to deepen money markets for government \nsecurities, thereby increasing overall market liquidity and predictability, while further creating an \nenabling policy and legislative environment for capital market development.18  \n \n8.  Increasing the share of lari-denominated general government debt. Between 2017 \nand 2019, the government began to gradually reduce its reliance on external debt. Domestic debt \nas a share of GDP increased from 7% in 2017 to 9.7% in 2019, whereas external debt as a share \nof GDP declined from 32.4% to 31.5% in the same period. Likewise, domestic debt as a share of \ntotal government debt increased from 17.8% in 2017 to 23.5% in 2019. While the COVID-19 \npandemic  partly  disrupted  this  balance\u2014the  share  of  domestic  debt  as  a  share  of  total \ngovernment debt declined from 23.5% in 2019 to 20.7% in 2020\u2014the government remains \ncommitted to this policy objective. During 2020\u20132024, it plans to gradually increase domestic debt \nas a share of government debt from 20.7% to 30.0%. The proposed program supports the \ngovernment in this endeavor by promoting institutional reforms that further deepen the domestic \ndebt market for government securities.19 This will help minimize public exposure to stability-\nthreatening refinancing and currency risks, which is a prerequisite for economic recovery.20 The \nprogram therefore supports policy actions that further strengthen money market infrastructure for \ngovernment securities on the one hand, while simultaneously supporting the development of \ncapital markets on the other hand. Deepening the market for treasury securities is an essential \nprecondition for the good functioning of other components of the capital market, since the treasury \nyield curve plays an important role in the pricing of the other securities (footnote 17). The program \nsupports continued and enhanced collaboration between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \nNBG to expand the issuance of benchmark bonds and thereby boost the liquidity, transparency, \nand predictability of the market. This will increase investors\u2019 interest in domestic government \nsecurities and correspondingly expand the investor base. In turn, the development of capital \nmarkets will accelerate the de-dollarization process and improve monetary policy transmission on \n \n15 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

Contingent liabilities threatening fiscal stability and economic recovery. Although \nGeorgia\u2019s public sector balance sheet is relatively healthy,22 increased exposure to fiscal risks \narising from power purchase agreements (PPAs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) jeopardize \nthe short- and medium-term fiscal sustainability during the COVID-19 crisis (footnote 15). The \nlarge SOE segment, with its high exposure to foreign exchange risks, represents a net draw on \nthe budget\u2014SOEs\u2019 imminent financing needs of about 18% of GDP23 threaten the fiscal stability \nthat underpins an economic recovery.24 A reclassification of state enterprises confirmed the \nexistence of 196 SOEs in the general government sector\u2014highlighting the dependence of many \nSOEs on government funding  and the role of government in  their management decisions. \nMoreover, of the six largest SOEs, only one generates sufficient operating profits to cover its \ncapital costs, while all others incur significant losses. Overall, the SOE segment has drawn a \ncumulative 6% of GDP from the government budget between 2015 and 2020. By IMF estimates, \na 30% depreciation of the lari from its August 2020 rate would reduce the net worth of the largest \nSOEs by about 4% of GDP, affecting the health of the government\u2019s fiscal position (footnote 15). \nSeveral major SOEs are also exposed to significant foreign exchange mismatches in their assets \nand liabilities.25   \n \n10.  Existing guarantees under PPAs are set to increase fiscal pressures, threatening the path \nto macroeconomic stability. Although the payment of PPA guarantees is to be met largely through \nuser fees, residual payments are worth 22% of GDP over 40 years.26 These payments could \ndouble  under  plausible  scenarios,  highlighting  the  need  to  manage  these  risks  effectively \n(footnote 15). Recent fiscal projections on the long-term implications of more than 150 PPAs \ncommit the government to ensuring minimum revenues\u2014or in some cases, returns\u2014to power \ngenerators over a 50-year-plus period worth about 65% of GDP. The major challenge posed by \nfiscal risks stemming from PPAs and SOEs is the lack of data and difficulty of incorporating it into \nthe budgeting process. Failure to properly reflect contingent liabilities in the budget framework, \nespecially during a crisis, can lead to expenditure overruns and fiscal pressures. Such a risk would \nfurther jeopardize an inclusive and sustainable recovery in the country and require immediate \naction. \n \n \n21 G. Abuselidze. 2018. Georgia\u2019s Capital Market: Functioning problems and development directions in association with \nEuropean Union. Journal of Applied Economic Sciences, 13(7):1929-1938.  \n22 Total assets across all government-controlled entities equal 149% of GDP, while liabilities are worth 81% of GDP, \nleaving a positive net worth of 68% of GDP (footnote 15). \n23  It is estimated that the gross financing requirements of the six major SOEs total about GEL7.6 billion (18% of GDP) \nduring 2021\u20132024. This includes about $350 million and \u20ac150 million by Georgian Oil and Gas Corporation (GOGC), \nand $400 million by Georgia Rail (footnote 15).  \n24 SOEs have been a large financial drain on government finances, with little contribution to public revenues. During \n2014\u20132018, net flows to SOEs totaled GEL2.6 billion, while the government's GEL4.6 billion equity investment \ngenerated very little or no dividends. The costs of SOE financing could place additional strain on the fiscal balance \nin the future, widening the fiscal deficit and, as a result, the ratio of general government debt to GDP. Moreover, \nSOEs require gross financing of GEL7.6 billion during 2020\u20132022, partly for refinancing and new financing (footnote \n15).  \n25 Some SOEs, such as Georgia Rail, do receive revenues in foreign currencies, providing a partial hedge against \ncurrency fluctuations, but overall the major SOEs are heavily exposed to depreciations\u2014particularly against the \nUnited States dollar and the euro\u2014since most of their debt is denominated in foreign currency (footnote 15). \n26 Annual payments for existing guarantees under PPAs are set to peak in 2024 at 0.6% of GDP under a favorable \nscenario (footnote 15).  ", "5 \n11.  Strengthening the management of fiscal risks. The government\u2019s ability to gradually \nnarrow the fiscal deficit to the 3% ceiling specified in the Economic Liberty Act hinges on its \ncapacity to avert unplanned fiscal expenditures that may arise when fiscal risks materialize. These \nrisks include (i) the materialization of obligations to provide minimum guarantees under some \nPPAs, as described in para. 9; (ii) exposure to natural disaster risks; and (iii) foreign exchange \nexposure and potential recapitalization requirements of the large SOE sector (footnote 15). \nInstitutional reforms that make it possible to identify, disclose, and prepare for such risks can help \navert unplanned fiscal pressures and the associated impacts on the fiscal deficit and general \ngovernment  debt.  International  experience  indicates  that  the  materialization  of  contingent \nliabilities, especially when coupled with exchange rate depreciation, was one of the most common \ncauses of unexpected increases in the general government debt\u2013GDP ratio during 2007\u20132019.27 \nContingent liabilities stemming from natural disasters, for example, have historically been as high \nas 10% of GDP in some countries.28  \n \n12.  Experience from the global financial crisis of 2008\u2014and the numerous episodes of SOE \nand bank recapitalization, and materialization of obligations to provide minimum guarantees under \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and PPAs\u2014serves to remind us how disruptive such risks can \nbecome to fiscal and debt stability.29 This includes fiscal risks from unfunded or underfunded \npolicy mandates executed by SOEs. In addition to providing a more stable macroeconomic \nenvironment, insulating public exposure to these unplanned fiscal pressures helps minimize \nopportunity costs for scarce public resources, which in turn creates additional fiscal space for key \nsocial spending and public investment priorities. \n \n13.  COVID-19's  impact  on  social  welfare  indicators.  Preliminary  estimates  from  the \nMonitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Lab\u2014set up with ADB support under the COVID-19 \nActive Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program\u2014suggest that the Anti-Crisis Plan \nwill mitigate a considerable surge in poverty incidence and loss of income across the income \ngroups.30 While the impact of the COVID-19 crisis would have certainly been much worse if no \nAnti-Crisis Plan had been in place, the poverty head-count is expected to increase in 2020 across \nvarious poverty lines (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Impact of COVID-19 on Poverty Head-count Under Different Scenarios And \nDifferent Poverty Lines \nScenario  National  $1.9 PPP  $3.2 PPP  $5.5 PPP  $10 PPP \nPoverty Line \nBaseline (2019)          19.5  4.5  15.7  42.9  77.9 \nImpact of COVID without Anti-Crisis Plan          43.3  19.9  37.5  63.0  87.7 \nImpact of COVID with Anti-Crisis Plan          28.5  8.6  23  49.7  80.1 \nMitigating impact of the Anti-Crisis Plan          14.8  11.3  14.5  13.3  7.6 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, PPP = purchasing power parity. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  Reforms to protect the elderly. Senior citizens are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 \ncrisis than the general population in two important ways.31 First, older adults are at a significantly \nincreased risk of severe disease following a coronavirus infection.

This \nhighlights the importance of an adequate and reliable social pension system to avoid a sharp \nincrease  in  the  old-age  poverty  incidence.  This  is  particularly  important  for  women,  who \nconstituted 71% of all universal pension beneficiaries in August 2020 and who rely on pension \npayouts  for  their  livelihoods.  Women's  life  expectancy  (78.2  years)  is  higher  than  men's \n(69.7 years), suggesting that women's reliance on the pension system is also higher than men's\u2014\non average, women live 17.2 years and men live 3.6 years on a pension. The COVID-19 crisis \nalso highlighted that the pension system, in addition to providing a financial lifeline to the elderly, \nhelps prevent a steeper resurgence of poverty levels in households with at least one pension \nrecipient. As the figure below illustrates, households with one or more pensioners witnessed a \nproportionally smaller increase in the poverty incidence. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis shed light \non how the right reforms to the pension system can ensure the social well-being of the largest \ngroup of vulnerable people in Georgia, i.e., not only senior citizens but also households with at \nleast one pension beneficiary.34 \n \nFigure 1: Poverty Headcount by Households (none, one, or two pensioners, Scenario Analysis \n19.350.434.4 13.644.627.6 16.840.225.6 1234.320.9 12.529.618.1 8.324.314\nNational poverty $3.2 line National poverty $3.2 line National poverty $3.2 line\nline line line\nNo pensioner One pensioner Two or more pensioners\nBaseline Lockdown Mitigation\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n15.  Reforms to the pension system. Structural and institutional reforms to the pension \nsystem are needed to protect the livelihoods of older adults, who are disproportionately exposed \nto the adverse health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. The reform of the pension system \nbegan in 2014\u20132015 with an assessment of the existing arrangements, after which the cabinet \nadopted a pension reform policy proposing to (i) link future increases of the universal basic \npension to inflation and (ii) introduce an additional contributory (Pillar II). The initial assessment, \nundertaken by the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development and supported by ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA), concluded that while the universal pension system did play a significant \nrole in reducing poverty, it did not provide a decent standard of living to its beneficiaries.35 \nProjections on future liabilities taking into account demographic trends36 suggested that the \n \n32 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 2014.

Living Conditions (accessed 14 July 2020). \n34 In addition to a general lack of access to labor income sources, adults aged 60 are also much more likely to live with \ndisabilities than young adults. About 20.5% of old-age pensioners are classified as disabled (58.6% of the total \nnumber of disabled people in the country.). Moreover, a majority (57.6%) of persons aged 65 and over consider \nthemselves unhealthy (in bad or very bad health). Geostat.

UNFPA. \n2017. Ageing and Older Persons in Georgia. Tbilisi. ", "7 \nuniversal pension system was not fiscally sustainable, given that it was to be financed exclusively \nfrom the state budget.37 Specifically, the practice of ad-hoc indexation of the universal basic \npension  resulted  in  unplanned  fiscal  pressures,  thwarting  efforts  to  achieve  better  budget \npredictability. The assessment report recommended that (i) universal pension payouts be raised \nto subsistence levels to avoid rises in old-age poverty; (ii) the government adopt a mechanism for \nthe indexation of universal pensions to maintain their purchasing value; (iii) the government \nestablish and operationalize a contributory pension savings scheme (Pillar II); and (iv) the \nuniversal pension scheme and contributory pension scheme be complemented with a fully private \npension scheme (Pillar III).38 In line with these policy recommendations, the government (i) \ngradually  increased  universal  pension  payouts  to  a  pre-determined  subsistence  level  and \nprovided an additional increase for those aged 70 and above; and (ii) effectively established and \noperationalized the contributory pension scheme (Pillar II), which is administered by the Pension \nAgency, a legal entity of public law. These measures are particularly beneficial for women, who \nconstitute 71% of all universal pension beneficiaries and roughly 65% of universal pension \nbeneficiaries older than 70. Further, to ensure fiscal sustainability of the pension system more \nbroadly, an indexation mechanism has been recently approved and the operationalization of the \ncontributory pension scheme was completed. This way, Georgia\u2019s pension scheme can maintain \nits role of poverty alleviation at fiscally affordable levels. The purchasing power of pensioners will \nremain stable since ad-hoc increases in the pension amount will no longer be common practice \n(footnote 32). The government remains committed to establishing a fully private pension scheme \nas soon as possible while continuing to improve the efficiency of the Pillar II pension scheme. \n \n16.  Anti-Crisis Plan expected to contain rise in unemployment. Formal unemployment \nrose from 11.6% at the end of 2019 to 12.3% in the second quarter of 2020.39 The full impact of \nCOVID-19 on unemployment levels will not be evident until the end of 2020. That said, preliminary \nestimates suggest that in 2020 roughly 385,000 people, or about 23.4% of the employed, face a \nhigh risk of job displacement.40 The impact on the self-employed might be milder since roughly \n75% of them work in agriculture, which was less affected during the lockdown than other sectors \n(footnote 40). At the same time, the below-average baseline earnings of the self-employed may \nrequire special policy emphasis.41 To try and mitigate mass retrenchment and loss of income, the \ngovernment  adopted  ambitious  employment  preservation  measures:  (i)  an  unemployment \nassistance benefit (direct transfer of GEL1,200 over 6 months); (ii) an income tax waiver for low-\nincome citizens (exempting firms from income tax for citizens with monthly incomes of less than \nGEL750, provided workers are kept on the payroll); and (iii) informal sector assistance (one-off \npayment of GEL300).42 As the economy begins to recover and these benefits are gradually lifted, \nit is expected that significant parts of the population will not have job opportunities and the \nunemployment rate will widen. Employment preservation and cash transfer measures targeting \nthe poorest members of society are expected to limit the increase in poverty incidence. Table 1 \nshows that even if the government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Plan mitigates the increase in the poverty \nheadcount index across the income distribution curve as anticipated, the increase is nonetheless \nexpected to be substantial. The government is acutely aware of the need to reform the social \nprotection systems to mitigate the medium-term impact of COVID-19 on unemployment and \npoverty, and to do so in a fiscally sustainable and gender-sensitive fashion.

Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n17.  The  proposed  programmatic  policy-based  loan  supports the  government\u2019s  efforts to \nensure  macroeconomic  stability  without  compromising  key  social  spending  to  protect  the \nlivelihoods of those most affected by the COVID-19 crisis. To this end, the program is composed \nof  two  subprograms  that  assist  the  government's  reform  efforts  across  three  main  areas: \n(i) strengthening the management of public exposure to fiscal risks, which was magnified by the \nCOVID-19 crisis; (ii) deepening the domestic debt markets for government securities to mitigate \npublic exposure to risks associated with external shocks, such as the need for further fiscal \nstimulus to cushion the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19; and (iii) strengthening the adequacy \nand fiscal sustainability of social protection programs to safeguard the livelihoods of those most \naffected by the COVID-19 crisis. The institutional challenges across these three areas require a \nphased and programmatic approach. The focus of subprogram 1 is on policy actions that either \naddress an immediate need or that lay the foundation for more tangible policy reforms under \nsubprogram 2. The total budget support provided under the program is $300 million, of which \n\u20ac170,823,000 ($200 million equivalent) are to be disbursed upon approval of subprogram 1 in \nOctober 2020, and $100 million under subprogram 2 in 2021.  \n \n18.  Reform area 1: Strengthening management of public exposure to fiscal risks. The \nobjective is to strengthen the management of public exposure to fiscal risks stemming from PPPs, \nPPAs, and/or SOEs to mitigate the risk of a hidden deficit and avoid a further decrease in fiscal \nspace  to  support  an  inclusive  and  sustainable  recovery.  Under  subprogram  1,  MOF  fully \noperationalized the Fiscal Risk Management Division, a dedicated unit to assess and quantify \npublic  exposure  to  fiscal  risks  stemming  from  SOEs  and  PPPs,  which  are  more  likely  to \nmaterialize as a result of the COVID-19 crisis; the division numbers at least six technical staff, \nand at least 75% of them are women. MOF also approved the PPP Guidelines, which include a \nguide  to  the  assessment  of  contingent  liabilities  and  a  value-for-money  approach  to  PPP \nevaluations, completing a PPP framework that ensures adequate identification, monitoring, and \nreporting of fiscal risk stemming from PPPs. MOF, through the Fiscal Risk Management Division, \nexpanded the scope of its fiscal risk statement to include (i) disclosure and discussion of \nmethodological instructions to identify, quantify, finance, and report the quasi-fiscal activities of \nSOEs; (ii) assessment of COVID-19 impacts on the likelihood that fiscal risks stemming from \nSOEs materialize in the short-to-medium term; (iii) expansion of the fiscal risk analysis of SOEs \nfrom 12 to 13 individual entities; (iv) discussion on the effect of SOE sectorization on public finance \nstatistics, including the impact on the Law of Georgia on Public Debt; (v) analysis of SOEs from \na sector perspective, with the aim of normalizing financial statements from SOEs; (vi) assessment \nof  the  stock  of  PPP  liabilities  based  on  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards \n(IPSAS32) and on the value-for-money approach to PPP evaluations (included in the recently \napproved PPP Guidelines); and a draft discussion of fiscal risks stemming from natural disasters \nand affecting municipalities.  \n \n19.  Under subprogram 2, the government will revise the legislative framework for the SOE \nsegment, increase MOF\u2019s role in SOE-related fiscal risk management, develop a formal system \nto account and fund community service obligations, and increase SOEs' accountability. Second, \nMOF will publish a ministerial statement that covers (i) the rationale for SOE ownership; (ii) the ", "9 \ncompetitive neutrality of SOEs; (iii) an analysis of corporate governance practices against OECD \nguidelines; and (iv) merit-based appointments of supervisory boards for all SOEs defined as \npublic interest entities with regard to 90% of their annual turnover. This ministerial statement will \ninform reforms to SOEs' corporate governance. Third, MOF will define and disclose fiscal risks \nstemming from natural disasters, including climate-change-related disasters, and publish them on \nits website to ensure comprehensive identification and reporting of fiscal risks. Finally, MOF will \nsubmit to Parliament an amendment to the Law of Georgia on Public Debt to expand the coverage \nof public sector debt statistics, which will help strengthen the management of fiscal risks.  \n \n20.  Reform area 2: Deepening domestic market for government securities. The objective \nis to manage the adverse effects associated with high public sector exposure to foreign-currency-\ndenominated debt, which was amplified by the COVID-19 crisis. To this end, the program \npromotes institutional reforms that help further deepen the domestic debt market for government \nsecurities and, ultimately, reduce the share of general government debt denominated in foreign \ncurrency. This will help minimize public exposure to the refinancing and currency risks that \nthreaten  macroeconomic  stability,  which  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  recovery.  Under \nsubprogram 1, MOF and the NBG commenced a primary dealer pilot and defined the rights, \nobligations, and rules for a future primary dealer system to promote activity in the primary and \nsecondary markets to reduce public reliance on external debt to finance future fiscal stimulus \npackages such as the Anti-Crisis Plan. Second, MOF issued a ministerial decree mandating that \nthe debt management strategy be updated, approved, and published on its website on an annual \nbasis to increase the predictability of the market for the government's domestic debt securities. \nThird, MOF issued benchmark bonds with a cumulative nominal value of at least GEL2 billion in \n2020 to boost investor interest in Georgian government securities and promote capital market \ndevelopment, which in turn will ensures the growth of lari liquidity. Finally, Parliament approved \nthe Investment Funds Law defining the legal, regulatory, and tax framework for investment funds, \nto create an enabling environment for the development of capital markets in Georgia.  \n \n21.  Under subprogram 2, MOF and NBG will add at least one new tenor to the primary dealer \npilot and publish their plan for moving to a full-fledged primary dealer system. Second, MOF will \nmandate primary dealers to disclose and make publicly available all pre-trade and post-trade \nfigures for all securities included in the primary dealer system. Third, MOF will approve a new \ndebt management strategy for 2021\u20132023, which includes an increase in the stock of domestic \ndebt to at least 10% of GDP by October 2023 to deepen the domestic debt market for government \nsecurities. Fourth, MOF will adopt a strategy to develop retail participation in the government bond \nmarket, which, subject to deliberations with the NBG, may include a savings-certificate-style \nmarket issued electronically. Fifth, the government, in collaboration with the NBG, will approve a \ncapital market development strategy to promote the mobilization of domestic private financial \nresources available to the government, which will minimize its reliance on external financing. Sixth, \nthe government will submit to Parliament a draft Law on Securitization to deepen capital markets \nby creating a new class of debt instruments and allowing market access to new participants, such \nas corporate players. Finally, the government will submit a draft law on covered bonds to deepen \ndomestic capital markets by widening the range of investment instruments available to investors. \n \n22.  Reform area 3: Ensuring adequacy and fiscal sustainability of social protection \nprograms that were expanded during the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant \nimpact on the financial well-being of senior citizens. To manage this issue, the government \nembarked on reforms to ensure the adequacy and fiscal sustainability of the pension scheme. \nThe pandemic also highlighted the need to reform other social protection systems, so as to ensure \nthat all those affected are given adequate financial support and to increase the social resilience \nof the country in case of a new crisis. The ADB program will support the government in these \n   ", "10 \ninitiatives to ensure that Georgia\u2019s social protection infrastructure can underpin an inclusive return \nto economic growth. Under subprogram 1, Parliament approved the revised 2020 budget, which \nincludes an increase of at least GEL30 in the universal pension payouts to beneficiaries aged 70 \nand above, 65% of whom are women; this will mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis \non old-age poverty. Parliament also approved an amendment to the Law of Georgia on State \nPensions, which introduces a rules-based mechanism for increases in universal pension payouts \nto  beneficiaries,  70%  of  whom  are  women.  Further,  the  government  established  and \noperationalized  the  independent  Pension  Agency  to  administer  the  new  supplementary \ncontributory pension scheme (Pillar II pension scheme); at least 50% of the agency's staff are \nwomen. The Pension Agency then ensured the registration of 100% of formal employers and \ncollected  contributions  from  at  least  90%  of  registered  employers,  as  well  as  associated \ncontributions from the government and employees. Finally, the Pension Agency adopted an \ninterim Cash and Cash Equivalent Investment Policy, which allows investments to be managed \nwithout any undue risk and ensures the transfer of all contribution payments into individual, \ninterest-bearing accounts. Under subprogram 2, the NBG and the Pension Agency will approve \nan investment policy for a pension savings scheme to guide the long-term investments of \ncontributions. The Pension Agency, in coordination with MOF, will approve an enforcement \nmechanism for pension scheme contributions to strengthen compliance by all formal employers \nwith the Law of Georgia on Pension Savings. To complement the Pillar II pension scheme, the \ngovernment will submit to Parliament the draft Law on Third Pillar Pensions to enable Georgian \nworkers to accumulate additional voluntary savings, whenever possible, and generate a third \nsource of old-age income. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program forms part of a broader package of support to \nGeorgia to manage the health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. It complements the \nCARES Program approved in May 202043 by supporting long-term institutional reforms that also \nhelp address the immediate institutional fragilities exposed by the COVID-19 crisis, and which \npave the way for sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. The need to accelerate long-term \ninstitutional reforms to manage an immediate crisis situation justifies the use of the fast-track \nprocedure. The program builds on more than a decade of close cooperation across key policy \nreform areas, such as fiscal risk management, public debt management, and social protection. \nSince 2014, ADB has been continuously engaged in policy dialogue with the government, and \nthe fiscal management and social protection reforms supported by ADB TA helped strengthen \npublic debt management and fiscal risk management while supporting government efforts to \nreform its public pension system44\u2014the largest social protection program in the country.45 The \nMEL Lab, an innovative solution forged under the CARES Program, helped guide the policy \ndiscussions around the proposed program and will keep on providing the evidence needed to \ninform the final shape of policy actions under subprogram 2. The lab provides ADB and the \ngovernment with live data on the evolution of key socioeconomic indicators, necessary to support \nan adequate and timely policy response to emerging needs. ADB has maintained a clear position \nwith regard to gender and poverty alleviation in these discussions with the government and will \ncontinue to do so in the future. ADB\u2019s financial support will help the government bridge its \nfinancing gap for 2020 at less onerous terms than it would otherwise be able to achieve, thus \ncontributing to debt sustainability in the long run. The financing support provided under the \nprogram is complemented by other ADB sector development loans and policy-based loans, which \n \n43 ADB. 2020.

Finally, and to complement \nADB\u2019s support to Georgia\u2019s inclusive economic recovery agenda, ADB is also providing a grant.46 \n \n24.  Lessons. Underpinned by strong country knowledge, the program is also informed by \nlessons from previous policy-based support to Georgia.47 Most importantly, ADB\u2019s previous \nengagement in structural and politically sensitive policy reforms in Georgia, such as the reform of \nthe pension system and the development of a domestic debt market, highlighted the importance \nof flexibility and sequencing in managing bottlenecks.48 A programmatic approach for policy-\nbased lending, combined with TA, was deemed a suitable modality because it ensures flexibility \nand allows for adequate sequencing of reforms across the subprograms.  \n \n25.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically the operational priorities of addressing poverty and reducing inequality (through its \nsupport for social protection, which is expected to mitigate an increase in poverty incidence); \naccelerating progress in gender equality (through gender-sensitive targets integrated into the \npolicy actions); and strengthening governance and institutional capacity (through support to public \ndebt management and fiscal risk management functions).49  \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reforms \n \n26.  The country\u2019s overarching development objective is sustained and inclusive growth based \non macroeconomic stability, as enshrined in the government\u2019s socioeconomic development \nstrategy, Georgia 2020.50 The effect of the reforms supported under the program will be the return \nto sustainable and inclusive economic growth, minimizing the exposure of Georgia\u2019s fiscal position \nto shocks caused by COVID-19 while safeguarding the welfare of the most vulnerable members \nof society. These reforms will primarily work through three transmission channels reflected in the \nPublic Financial Management Reform Strategy:51 (i) management of public exposure to fiscal \nrisks strengthened; (ii) domestic debt market for government securities deepened; (iii) adequacy \nand fiscal sustainability of social protection programs strengthened.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Development Partner Coordination \n27.  Development financing needs for 2020. Despite the government\u2019s efforts to reprioritize \nexpenditure and create additional fiscal space, the financing gap for fiscal year 2020 (ending \n31 December 2020) remains considerably high at $1,613 million. The financing gap is to be closed \nprimarily through loans and grants from development partners as well as domestic borrowing; \ngovernment deposits are available to weather downside risks, if necessary. Besides ADB, the \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the IMF, the World Bank, and selected bilateral partners \nhave committed to assist Georgia in accessing finance (Table 2). ADB's budget support in 2020 \nwill tentatively total $530 million, or 30% of the total financing gap.  \n   \n \n46 ADB. 2020.

As of August 2020, expected budget support from development partners exceeds the \nfinancing gap by $169 million. First, although $1,782 million in budget support have been \ndiscussed with development partners, only $1,157 million have been signed by 24 August 2020, \nof which only $615 million have been disbursed thus far. As such, there is a risk that some of \nthese budget support programs are cancelled or delayed to 2021. Second, there is the possibility \nthat some cash and in-kind transfers under the Anti-Crisis Plan need to be extended beyond their \ninitial 6-month term. If this happens the financing gap would have to be revised again. Third, \nshould  these  resources  be  disbursed  and  the  financing  gap  kept  at  $1,613  million,  the \nGovernment of Georgia would be able to create a fiscal buffer of GEL2.7 billion which could also \nbe utilized if unexpected liquidity pressures materialize in 2021.52 \n \n29.  Close coordination with development partners. The ADB team consulted and closely \ncoordinated with all development partners that are providing budget support to Georgia in 2020, \nespecially those providing TA to public debt management, fiscal risk management, and social \nprotection reform.53 Coordination with the IMF has been particularly important to ensure the \ncomplementarity of ADB's support with the IMF\u2019s Extended Financing Facility, especially the \ncoordination of structural benchmarks and quantitative performance criteria with regard to the \ncoverage and monitoring of fiscal risks, and the strengthening of SOEs' corporate governance. \n \n30.  The government has requested a loan of \u20ac170,823,000 ($200,000,000 equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.

The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).54 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Governance. Georgia's public financial management systems have improved significantly \nthanks to the implementation of the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy\u2014minimizing \nthe risks associated with poor financial management of the proposed program. According to the \nmost recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment, Georgia has \nsound systems in place for strategic budget planning, execution, and accounting and reporting.55 \nNotable improvements in fiscal discipline are reflected in (i) less variance of expenditure outturn \nfrom the budget, i.e., fewer administrative transfers of budgetary funds; (ii) robust execution rates \nfor revenue; and (iii) stronger oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from SOEs and PPPs, which the \nprogram supports. Georgia also improved its strategic allocation of resources through its multi-\nyear budgeting tool and the preparation of costed sector strategies. Finally, the use of resources \nfor service delivery has become more efficient, with more effective payroll controls, internal audit, \ntimelier and more regular reconciliation of accounts, and an expansion of the scope and nature \nof follow-up audits.  \n \n33.  Poverty and gender. The proposed program supports the government of Georgia in \nmanaging the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable, in particular \nthe elderly, who are disproportionally exposed to the consequences. Despite substantial gains, \nhouseholds in Georgia remain highly vulnerable to shocks, such as those associated with the \noutbreak of COVID-19, which is estimated to increase the national poverty headcount from 20.1% \nin 2019 to 28.5% in 2020.56 Further, while absolute poverty ($1.90/day) has declined sharply from \n12.2% in 2010 to an estimated 3.7% in 2020, the effects of COVID-19 could increase the poverty \nincidence to 8.6%.57 Georgia\u2019s current social welfare system covers a relatively high share of the \npopulation but may not be sufficient to meet the needs of its poorest citizens. As of 2018, only \n11.7% of Georgians receive a subsistence allowance under the targeted social assistance, \nagainst 20.1% of people living under the national poverty line, suggesting that wider coverage \nmay be necessary. The proposed program introduces structural and institutional reforms that seek \nto mitigate  increases  in  poverty  incidence,  especially  old-age  poverty,  while  also  including \nproactive gender mainstreaming features. Increases in pension payouts for  people aged 70 and \nabove is particularly relevant for women, who make up roughly 65% of all beneficiaries in this age \nbracket and who are disproportionately vulnerable to the adverse health and economic effects of \nthe COVID-19 crisis (para. 14). Further, indexing increases in pension payouts to maintain their \npurchasing power shields the women who benefit from the universal pension scheme (71% of \nbeneficiaries) against gradual loss of income and poverty. The program also ensures that newly \nor recently created public agencies are staffed in a gender-sensitive manner. For instance, at \nleast 50% of technical staff recruited for the Pension Agency are women. Likewise, 85% of all \ntechnical staff in the Fiscal Risk Management Division are women. The program is classified as \neffective gender mainstreaming.  \n \n54 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n55 PEFA Secretariat. 2018.
