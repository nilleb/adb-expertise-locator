From 2000 to 2008, the economy grew \nat an average annual growth rate of 9%, one of the highest rates in the world. The share of the \npopulation living below the subsistence line, however, is still at 5% nationwide and 9% in rural \nareas.1\n The global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, which interrupted Kazakhstan\u2019s growth, was a \nreminder  of  the  need  to  sustain  gains  of  the  past  to  improve  prospects  for  the  future. \nKazakhstan  needs  to  diversify  its  economy  and  reduce  its  dependence  on  oil  and  other \nextractive  minerals,  which  accounted  for  22%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  63%  of \nexports  in  2010.  To  diversify  and  transcend  its  middle-income-country  challenge,  Kazakhstan \nneeds to increase its productivity and competitiveness. The private sector will ultimately lead the \ntransformation  of  the  economy  by  increasing  productivity  and  diversity  via  innovation  and \nentrepreneurship.2 \n \n3. \nThe  government\u2019s  industrial  development  program  for  2010\u20132016  lists  the  \u2015agro-\nindustrial complex\u2016 as a priority sector for the diversification of the economy and a sector with \nstrong export potential.3 Agriculture has a huge growth potential in Kazakhstan thanks to its vast \nterritory  and  its  proximity  to  large  growth  markets  (People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Russia,  and \nIndia).  Total  agricultural  land  is  about  2.1  million  square  kilometers,  of  which  89%  is  pasture \nland  and  11%  is  arable  land.  Grains,  meat,  dairy  products,  and  processed  food  have  great \npotential  to  successfully  compete  in  the  global  market.  Although  agriculture  contributed  only \nabout 5% of GDP, its employment contribution was about 25% of the total working population in \n2010.4  \n \nIn  December  2011,  ADB  staff  met  the  top  management  of  the  RG  Brands  group  (RG \n4. \nBrands)\u2014one of the leading producers of milk, juice, and tea in Kazakhstan\u2014and assessed the \nfinancing needs and strategic fit.  RG Brands was found suitable for ADB assistance based on \nits solid operational and financial track record. In 2007, RG Brands received a $50 million loan \nfrom the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the construction of a \nproduction  site  in  Aksengir,  near  Almaty.  In  February  2012,  RG  Brands  applied  for  ADB\u2019s \nassistance to fund its capital expenditures over the 2013\u20132015 period (including the expansion \nof  milk  and  juice  production  facilities  and  the  purchase  of  coolers  and  delivery  trucks)  and  to \nrefinance a portion of its debt maturing in the short term. \n                                                \n1   Government  of  Kazakhstan.  Agency  of  Statistics  website:  www.eng.stat.kz  (accessed  on  18  March  2013). \nAccording  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  which  defines  the  poverty \nline as 60% of the national median-equalized household income, the poverty rate is 17% nationwide and exceeds \n25% in some rural areas (source: OECD. 2011. Kazakhstan Sector Competitiveness Strategy. Paris.).    \n\n2  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n3   Government  of  Kazakhstan.  2010.  State  Program  of  Accelerated  Industrial  and  Innovative  Development  of  the \n\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, 2010\u20132014. Astana. \n\n4   OECD. 2011. Kazakhstan Sector Competitiveness Strategy. Paris. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  central  to  RG  Brands'  strategy  of  increasing  the  local  content  of  its \n5. \nproducts,  improving  production  and  distribution  efficiency,  maintaining  and  expanding  direct \naccess  to  customers,  and  increasing  exports  to  neighboring  countries.  The  project  is  also \nconsistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  government\u2019s  industrial  development  program  for  the \nagribusiness  industry,  which  include  securing  national  food  independence,  increasing  added \nvalue  by  16%,  increasing  per  capita  productivity  from  $3,000  to  $6,000,  and  increasing  the \nshare of agriculture products in the country\u2019s total exports from 3.5% in 2010 to 8.0% by 2015. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe  project  consists  of  (i)  the  expansion  of  RG  Brands\u2019  ultra-high  temperature  (UHT) \nmilk  and  juice  production  facilities  ($14.9  million),  (ii)  investments  to  boost  efficiency  in \nproduction and distribution ($15.3 million), and (iii) the refinancing of debt maturing in the short \nterm ($10.0 million) to compensate for the lack of long-term debt financing in the market. \n \n7. \nADB\u2019s  financing  will  help  improve  UHT  milk  production  in  the  Kostanay  plant  (in  the \nnorth of Kazakhstan). The funds will be invested in milk collection systems, particularly in trucks \nthat  will  collect  raw  milk  from  dairy  farms  and  households  in  different  parts  of  the  Kostanay \nregion  and  deliver  it  directly  to  the  plant.  The  investment  will  also  enhance  production  and \nstorage facilities in Kostanay. Finally, RG Brands will build a similar UHT milk production unit in \nAksengir, within the existing Aksengir production center. \n \n8. \nRG  Brands  sources  raw  milk  from  farmers  in  the  Kostanay  region.  In  2011,  the  group \nstarted implementing a new system of working with dairy farms by providing long-term contracts \nto  dairy  farms,  which  in  turn  can  use  these  to  obtain  financing  from  local  banks.  RG  Brands \nworks with 11 dairy farms and eight villages where small household farmers supply their milk to \nthe plant. As a pilot project, RG Brands invested $500,000 in the Turar Dairy Farm in Kostanay \nto help it purchase milk equipment and provide working capital. As a result, RG Brands secured \na  reliable  supply  of  high-quality  milk.  The  farm  created  150  new  jobs  and  included  new  water \ntreatment and a water supply system for the Turar village. ADB financing would help RG Brands \nfurther expand such initiatives. \n \nTo  help  sustain  the  growth  of  the  juice  business,  RG  Brands  plans  to  invest  in  the \n9. \nimprovement  of  its  juice  production  facilities  in  Aksengir  (e.g.,  pasteurization,  blending,  and \nsyrup  preparation),  as  well  as  in  a  new  juice  production  line  in  Kostanay.  About  25%  of  the \nconcentrates  and  purees  used  by  RG  Brands  are  sourced  from  farmers  in  Kazakhstan, \nsupplying peaches, tomatoes, and apples. RG Brands works closely with two juice concentrate \nfactories  from  the  Almaty  region.  Additional  investment  in  similar  facilities  will  be  required  to \nmeet  RG  Brands\u2019  increasing  demand  in the  coming  years  while  sustaining the  level  of quality. \nRG Brands\u2019 parent, Resmi Group, is planning to launch an agribusiness private equity fund that \nwould invest in juice concentrate factories and fruit farms, thus helping increase the proportion \nof locally made concentrates used in the production of RG Brands juices. \n \n10. \nGiven the large territory of Kazakhstan, efficient distribution is critical. RG Brands works \nwith about 40,000 small convenience stores, more than half of which are in rural areas. Usually, \nthese convenience stores are owned and run by families that lack the financial resources to buy \ntheir  own  equipment,  such  as  coolers  and  racks  for  store  products  like  milk  and  juices.  RG \nBrands plans to maintain its annual investment in coolers for these shops. To further increase \ndistribution  efficiency,  it  is  launching  a  new  pilot  project  to  finance  delivery  trucks  that  will  be \nleased to individual entrepreneurs. Finally,  RG Brands\u2019 investment plan includes investment in \npower system modernization, required to ensure production efficiency.  \n \n\n\f3 \n\nRG Brands has about $60 million of debt maturing in 2013 and 2014, out of its total debt \n11. \nof  about  $75  million  as  of  December  2012.  To  extend  the  maturity  profile  of  this  debt,  it  is \nseeking  long-term  funding  from  ADB  to  refinance  $10  million  of  bonds  and  loans  maturing  in \n2013 and 2014. The extension of its debt maturity profile will enable RG Brands to increase its \nannual investment levels and ensure continuous growth. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\nRG Brands, established in 1994, is one of the leading producers of milk, juice, tea, and \n12. \nother  food  and  beverage  products  in  Kazakhstan.  With  leading  brands  and  dominant  market \nshares in key market segments, a modern production base and world-class management team, \nRG Brands is focused on becoming the largest and most efficient food and beverage group in \nCentral  Asia  by  2017.  In  2012,  its  total  assets  reached  $194  million;  total  revenues  were \n$245 million;  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation,  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  amounted \nto  $36 million;  and  net  profit  was  $27  million.  The  group  is  targeting  revenues  of  more  than \n$600 million and an EBITDA margin greater than 15% by 2017. \n \n13. \nRG  Brands  has  two  main  production  centers:  Kostanay  and  Aksengir.  The  Kostanay \nplant, which RG Brands acquired from Nestl\u00e9 in 2004 for a total consideration of $2.3 million, is \nits  only  milk  production  facility.  The  Kostanay  region  is  known  as  an  agricultural  center  of \nKazakhstan  thanks  to  its  favorable  climate  and  availability  of  agricultural  land.  In  2007,  RG \nBrands,  along  with  EBRD  and  Kazakhstan  Development  Bank,  invested  $75  million  in  the \nconstruction of a modern production facility in Aksengir to consolidate the production processes \nin the Almaty region into a single site.  \n \n14. \nRG  Brands  has  its  own  extensive,  nationwide  sales  and  distribution  platform.  Its \n10 regional  sales  offices  are  located  in  the  largest  cities  of  Kazakhstan  and  account  for  about \n75%  of  total  sales.  RG  Brands  also  works  with  eight  third-party  distributors,  each  operating \nexclusively in a dedicated region, which account for 25% of total sales. RG Brands holds the top \nthree  market  positions  in  all  segments  of  operations:  UHT  milk  (23.0%),  juices  (15.3%), \npackaged tea (8.2%), carbonated soft drinks (14.8%), and ice tea (14.0%). Its exports (mainly to \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan)  reached  10.5%  of  its  gross \nsales in 2012. RG Brands plans to triple its exports by 2017.  \n \n15. \nRG  Brands\u2019  founder  and  major  shareholder  is  a  well-known  businessman,  Kairat \nMazhibayev,  who  owns  the  business  through  Resmi  Group,  an  investment  holding  company \nthat  is  also  engaged  in  real  estate,  retail,  and  asset  management.  Resmi  Group  successfully \ninvested in and exited several businesses. \n \n16. \nRG Brands directly employs about 1,600 staff, who each receive benefits in compliance \nwith local labor law (e.g., RG Brands pays 10% of the gross monthly salary directly to a pension \nfund  of  the  employee's  choice).  In  addition,  about  1,500  households  indirectly  depend  on  the \nRG  Brands  business  for  their  livelihood  (e.g.,  milk  farmers,  juice  concentrate  factory  workers, \nand fruit farmers). \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\n17. \nThe project will contribute to (i) sustained  contribution of the agriculture sector to GDP, \n(ii) increased exports of agriculture and food products, and (iii) private sector development. The \n\n1. \n\nImpacts \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nagriculture  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  GDP  is  expected  to  remain  above  5%  from  2012  to  2019.5 \nThe share of agriculture and food products in total exports is expected to increase from 3.5% in \n2010  to  8.0%  by  2019,  in  line  with  the  objective  of  the  government\u2019s  industrial  development \nprogram.6 The project is expected to have a demonstration effect, inducing commercial banks to \nlend  more  to  private  companies  involved  in  the  sector.  Nonsovereign  loans  granted  by \ncommercial banks to agribusinesses is expected to increase from T300 billion in 2012 to at least \nT800  billion  by  2020,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  plan  of  a  cumulative  T2 trillion  increase  in \nnonsovereign loans to agribusinesses over the 2013\u20132020 period.7 \n \n18. \nThe project will also strengthen national food security and food safety. It is expected to \nhelp  increase  the  consumption  of  safe  and  nutritious  beverage. 8  Specifically,  per  capita \nconsumption of UHT milk is expected to increase from 12 liters per annum in 2011 to 17 liters in \n2017 and per capita consumption of juices from 12 liters per annum in 2011 to 20 liters in 2017.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe project\u2019s expected outcome will be the efficient production and distribution of quality \n19. \nfood  products,  with  greater  inputs  from  local  farmers.  Production  of  UHT  milk  is  expected  to \nincrease from 25 million liters per annum in 2011 to at least 50 million liters in 2017. Production \nof juices is expected to increase from 60 million liters per annum in 2011 to at least 120 million \nliters in 2017. The average time to deliver products to retailers is expected to decrease from 2 to \n3 days to 1 day. Raw milk sourced locally is expected to increase from about 20 million liters per \nannum  in  2011  to  at  least  45  million  liters  in  2017.  Juice  concentrate  sourced  locally  should \nincrease from 0.5 million kilograms per annum in 2011 to 2.0 million kilograms in 2017. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n20. \nThe  output  of  the  project  is  the  successful  completion  of  the  investment  plan  by  2015. \nThe investment plan compromises the expansion of the UHT milk and juice production facilities \nin Aksengir and Kostanay, investments to boost distribution efficiency (coolers and juice racks to \nbe  installed  at  small  convenient  stores,  and  delivery  trucks  to  be  leased  to  individual \nentrepreneurs), and investments to boost production efficiency. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n21. \nThe project is consistent with Strategy 2020. Supporting agriculture and rural areas is an \n\u2015underlying  component  of  the  inclusive  growth  strategy\u2016  because  \u2015the  majority  of  the  poor  still \nlive  in  rural  areas,  and  agriculture  remains  a  source  of  productivity  improvement,  seasonal \nemployment,  and  income  growth\u2014especially  when  connected  to  urban,  industrial,  and  export \nmarkets.\u2016  By  connecting  agricultural  production  to  food  processing  and  export  markets,  the \nproject will contribute to economic growth and the reduction of rural poverty in Kazakhstan. The \nproject  is  also  consistent  with  Strategy  2020\u2019s  objective  of  scaling  up  private  sector \ndevelopment and private sector operations in all operational areas.9 \n                                                \n5   Economist Intelligence Unit. 2012.

Astana. \n8   Fruit  juices are  a  good source  of  vitamin  C  and  fiber.  UHT  milk  is  safer  than  fresh milk,  as  bacterial spores  are \nkilled in the heating process, but has the same nutritional value (calcium and vitamins A, B, and D). UHT milk is \neasier to transport, allowing for a wider distribution to regions with low raw milk production. It has a long shelf life of \n6\u20139 months, which means that it can be stored for winter, when milk production is very low.  \n\n9  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020. Manila. \n\n\f5 \n\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Kazakhstan,  agribusiness  is \n22. \none of the sectors to be supported by ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The strategy recognizes \nKazakhstan\u2019s  strong  prospects  in  agriculture,  stemming  from  its  vast  arable  land  area.  The \nproject  is  consistent  with  two  of  the  main  drivers  of  the  strategy\u2014private  sector  development \nand greater regional integration\u2014since it will support exports of high-quality food products from \nKazakhstan  to  neighboring  Central  Asian  countries.  Through  its  demonstration  effect  on  local \nbanks, the project will also contribute to the strategy outcome indicator targeting an increase in \noverall bank loans as a proportion of GDP from 39% in 2011 to 50% in 2016.10 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n23. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  agriculture  sector  strategy.  In  particular,  the \nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security (2009) recommends an \u2015expanded partnership \nwith the private sector\u2016 in order to attract \u2015more direct investments in productivity enhancement, \nagro-processing,  agro-retailing  and  other  nonfarm  rural  business.\u2016  Assistance  to  a  food \nprocessor  also  incorporates  the  operational  plan\u2019s  objective  of  \u2015increasing  synergy  and  value \naddition  in  the  backward  and  forward  linkages  along  the  food  and  agriculture  value  chain.\u2016 \nStronger links along the value chain boost productivity, jobs, exports and regional trade, as well \nas food security for the poor in both rural and urban areas.11  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n24. \nThe  project,  including  the  proposed  refinancing  of  existing  debt,  is  estimated  to  cost \naround T6.0 billion, or $40.2 million, over 2013\u20132015. Given its current asset base ($194 million \nas of December 2012) and its low leverage ratios (debt\u2013equity of 0.8 times and debt\u2013EBITDA of \n1.9 times as of December 2012), RG Brands intends to finance the project solely with long-term \ncorporate debt from ADB. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost \n\nProject Description \n\nA.

The  project  does  not  operate  under  a \nconcession agreement and its tariffs are not regulated. \nRG  Brands  is  led  by  a  team  of  expatriates  and  locally  experienced  managers,  with \nextensive experience in leading international food and beverage companies. \nEquipment chosen for ADB financing will be purchased and installed in 2013\u20132015. \nThe  equipment  required \ninternational \nmanufacturers  that  will  be  selected  based  on  competitive  bidding.  For  the  milk  and \njuice  processing  lines,  RG  Brands  works  with  world-renowned  equipment  suppliers \nsuch as Krones, Sidel, Tetra Pak, and Van Der Molen. \nThe  project  will  rely  on  RG  Brands  for  its  successful  operation.  RG  Brands  has \nrelevant and extensive experience in milk and juice production. Under already existing \nsupply  arrangements,  raw  milk  is  sourced  from  local  farmers  and  an  increasing \nproportion  of  juice  concentrate  is  sourced  from  local  producers.  The  project  will  also \nbenefit from RG Brands\u2019 sales and distribution platform and marketing expertise. \nRG Brands will report on key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators. \n\nthe  project  will  be  procured \n\nfrom \n\nfor \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n26.   RG  Brands\u2019  return  on  invested  capital  is  expected  to  increase  from  19.0%  in  2012  to \nabove  22.5%  from  2016  onward.  The  company  is  financially  viable  because  the  return  on \ninvested capital is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 11.8%. The company is \nalso economically sustainable, as the economic return on invested capital is 24.7%, higher than \nthe social discount rate of 12%. \n \nG. \n\nUnique Features \n\nThe project promotes inclusive agricultural value chain development in innovative ways. \n27. \nRG  Brands  will  enter  into  long-term  procurement  contracts  with  local  dairy  farmers  and  will \nprovide  critical  equipment  to  small  retailers,  enabling  them  to  participate  in  the  high-quality \nbeverage  value  chain.  This  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign  agribusiness  project  in \nCentral and West Asia. This is also the first direct nonsovereign assistance in Kazakhstan (as \nopposed to assistance through a financial intermediary). \n \n\n6 \n\n25. \n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe  proposed  assistance  is  a  senior  loan  of  up  to  $40.2  million  to  LLP  RG  Brands \n28.  \nKazakhstan. The loan will comprise two tranches: (i) tranche A in the amount of $30.2 million for \nthe purpose of financing the borrower\u2019s capital expenditures, and (ii) tranche B in the amount of \n$10.0 million for the purpose of refinancing the borrower\u2019s debt. \n  \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n29.   ADB  will  support  a  \u2015national  champion\u2016  in  a  strategic  industry  for  Kazakhstan. \nAgribusiness is not only increasingly contributing to GDP and export growth, it is also a labor-\nintensive  sector  that  will  continue  to  create  jobs.  The  ADB  loan  will  help  RG  Brands  finance \nlong-life productive assets and reduce its exposure to debt maturing in the short term, freeing it \nto  reinvest  more  annual  earnings  in  annual  capital  expenditures  to  support  its  growth.  RG \nBrands\u2019 suppliers will also expand their businesses in response to the company\u2019s growth, which \nin turn will generate indirect employment. \n \n30.   ADB  will  add  value  by  providing  long-tenor  financing,  which  is  not  readily  available  for \nprivate sector companies in Kazakhstan. Accessing long-term debt has become a challenge for \ncompanies of the size of RG Brands since the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis. Only the government \nand large conglomerates are now able to raise bonds, as pension funds (the main bond buyers) \nare  subject  to  new  prudential  norms.  The  commercial  bank  market  has  become  almost \nexclusively  short  term,  since  the  proportion  of  short-term  funds  on  banks\u2019  balance  sheets  has \nalso increased as a reaction to the crisis, which caused several Kazakh banks to default on their \nlong-term  obligations.  Nonetheless,  well-run  medium-sized  private  sector  companies  like  RG \nBrands still need long-term funding to support their growth. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n31. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment  and  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. A corporate and compliance audit conducted on RG Brands\u2019 environmental and social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  and  existing  facilities  showed  that  the  company\u2019s  systems  on \noccupational  health  and safety  and food  safety  are  satisfactory.  However,  waste management \nand  pollution control  need  to  be  improved.  A  corrective  action  plan  has  been  prepared,  which \nthe  company  has  committed  to  implement  and  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  company's \ninitial  environmental  examination  and  corresponding  environmental \nrevised  ESMS.  An \nmanagement  plan  have  been  prepared  for  the  proposed  investment  plan.  RG  Brands  will \nensure that the potential environmental and social impacts of the overall project are recognized, \nand  that  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  plans.  RG  Brands  has  committed  to  step  up  its \ninstitutional  capability  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts,  adopt  an \nESMS agreed on with ADB before the first disbursement, and submit annual monitoring reports. \nInformation disclosure and consultations with affected people are conducted in accordance with \nADB requirements. \n \n32.   ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nrequiring RG Brands to comply with national labor laws and the internationally recognized core \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nlabor  standards  for  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  project,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy.12  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Anti-Money Laundering Policies \n\n33. \nRG Brands was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption policy (1998, as amended to date), and \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent  with its  commitment to governance, accountability  and transparency,  ADB  requires \nthat  RG  Brands  institute,  maintain  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n34. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \n35. \nGovernment  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  RG  Brands  will  be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  up  to  $40,200,000  ($28,900,000  to  be  disbursed  in  Kazakhstani  tenge \nequivalent\u2014unless  the  cross  currency  swap  market  is  unavailable,  in  which  case  ADB  will \ndisburse  this  amount  in US  dollar\u2014and $11,300,000 to  be  disbursed  in US  dollar)  to  LLP  RG \nBrands Kazakhstan for the RG Brands Agribusiness Project in Kazakhstan from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nBindu N.
