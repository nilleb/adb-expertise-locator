Despite  the  initial  slow  start-up,  the  project  is \nprogressing well. In 2007 alone, contracts worth $156 million were \nawarded out of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan proceeds \nof  $181  million.  The  cumulative  contract  awards  reached  $173 \nmillion,  with  a  loan  balance  of  $8  million  for  further  contract \nawards.  There  is,  however,  about  $82  million  worth  of  contracts \nthat remain to be awarded. In other words, the project faces a cost \noverrun. \n \nThe reason for the cost overrun is an increase in the original cost \nestimates,  caused  mainly  by  (i)  rupee  appreciation,  and  (ii)  price \nincreases between the initial loan appraisal in 2003 and 2007. The \nrecent steep appreciation of the rupee resulted in the reduction of \nthe  initial  loan  amount  in  rupee  terms  by  approximately  Rs2.0 \nbillion \nfor \nconstruction  materials  in  the  booming  Indian  economy  and  a \nworldwide  increase  in  oil  prices  have  led  to  large  cost  increases \nfor  construction  materials\u2014the  price  index  of  steel  increased  by \n12%  per  year  on  average,  cement  increased  by  10%,  and  fuel \nincreased  by  9%.  The  impact  of  the  price  escalation  on  the  total \nproject  cost  was  estimated  at  Rs1.2  billion \n($31  million \nequivalent), or 9%. \n \nWithout  additional  financing,  the  project  in  its  original  scope \ncannot  be  completed,  and  the  system  integrity  of  the  urban \ninfrastructure for water supply, sewerage, and waste disposal will \nbe  severely  undermined.  Consequently,  not  only  will  there  be \nabout a 35% reduction in the number of potential beneficiaries of \nthe  project,  but  the  beneficiaries  will  also  be  connected  to \nincomplete  systems  of  urban  infrastructure.  Being  a  high  priority \nproject, these pending works will eventually have to be carried out \nby  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  municipal \ncorporations. However, due to the limited availability of long-term \nfinancial  resources,  it  is  uncertain  when  the  government  of \nMadhya  Pradesh  and  the  municipal  corporations  can  secure  the \nfull amount to complete the original project scope. The economic \n\n($50.6  million  equivalent).  The  high  demand \n\n\fii \n\n \n \n\n \n\nand financial analyses of the initial loan indicate that the extent of \nreduction  in  the  internal  rate  of  returns  is  greater  for  a  1-year \ndelay  in  benefit  than  for  a  10%  capital  cost  increase.  In  other \nwords, there is a clear indication that completion of the full scope \nof  the  project  is  more  financially  sustainable  and  economically \nviable than leaving the project incomplete for an unknown period. \n \nThere are about 30 contracts under the proposed supplementary \nfinancing. Out of the 30 contracts, nine are ready to be awarded, \nand  are  expecting  to  receive  ADB  retroactive  financing.  Detailed \nengineering  design  will  be  completed  for  eight  contracts  before \nSeptember  2008  and  for  all  remaining  contracts  before  January \n2009. \n \n\n \nRevised Financing Plan \n\n \nRevised Investment Plan  Revised costs for the project, including those to be financed under \nthe  proposed  supplementary  loan,  are  estimated  at  $383  million \nincluding taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, and \nfinancing  charges  during \nimplementation.  The  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  from  ADB  financing  is  $71  million,  which \nconsists of $50.6 million for recuperating from the impact of rupee \nappreciation and $20.4 million for meeting the price escalation.  \n \nUnder the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will \ncover 65.8% of the total investment costs. Of the total investment \nthe  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  municipal \ncost, \ncorporations  will  finance  34.1%,  and  the  United  Nations  Human \nSettlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) will finance 0.1% through \nparallel  grant  cofinancing.  The  Government  of  India  will  pass  the \nproposed  supplementary  loan  on  to  the  government  of  Madhya \nPradesh on the same terms as the ADB loan. The government of \nMadhya  Pradesh  will  then  onlend  the  loan  to  the  municipal \ncorporations on similar terms and conditions as that for the initial \nloan to be synchronous with the initial loan repayment period.  \n \nA loan of $71 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The repayments of the supplementary loan \nwill  be \nloan. \nConsequently,  the  loan  will  have  a  term  of  20  years,  no  grace \nperiod,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n30 September 2011 \n \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  supplementary \nloan will remain the same as for the initial project loan, except for \n(i) the use of advance contracting and retroactive financing, (ii) a \nrevised implementation period, and (iii) continuous engagement of \nconsultants. \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\n \nSupplementary Loan \nAmount and Terms \n\nfully  synchronized  with \n\nthat  of \n\ninitial \n\nthe \n\n\f \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards  assessments  were \nconducted  prior  to  approval  of  the  initial  loan.  Since  there  is  no \nphysical  change  within  the  original  scope  and/or  design,  or \nmodified  or  incremental  activities  or  components,  no  additional \nenvironmental and social safeguards assessments are necessary. \n\niii \n\n \n\n\f76  00'Eo\n\n82  00'Eo\n\nR A J A S T H A N\n\nTikamgarh\n\nI N D I A\nURBAN WATER SUPPLY AND\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN\nMADHYA PRADESH PROJECT\n\n26  00'No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\ne r\n\na l  R i v\n\nb\n\nm\n\na\n\nh\n\nC\n\nGwalior\n\nJhansi\n\nShivpuri\n\nGuna\n\nRajgarh\n\nMandsaur\n\nRatlam\n\nUjjain\n\nDewas\n\nDhar\n\nIndore\n\nMhow\n\nHoshangabad\n\nHarda\n\nSagar\n\nr\n\ne\n\nN a r m a d a   R i v\n\nKhandwa\n\nBetul\n\nBurhanpur\n\nM A H A R A S H T R A\n\nG U J A R A T\n\n22  00'No\n\n0\n8\n-\n3\n6\n5\n8\n \nH\nR\n\n76  00'Eo\n\nBHOPAL\n\nJabalpur\n\nShahdol\n\nNarsimhapur\n\nLakhnadon\n\nMandla\n\nC H H A T T I S G A R H\n\nU T T A R      P R A D E S H\n\n26  00'No\n\nRewa\n\nSidhi\n\nMathur\n\nMurwara\n\n22  00'No\n\nProject City\n\nState Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nState Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n82  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  India  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental  Improvement  in \nMadhya Pradesh Project.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n2. \nThe  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (which  translates  to  \"central  province\")  is  located  in  the \ngeographic heart of India. It was created in 1956 by merging three states,2 and until 2000 was \nthe  largest  state  in  India.3  Its  capital  is  Bhopal.  Madhya  Pradesh  inherited  its  poor  economic, \nsocial and physical infrastructure from the original three states.  \n \n3. \nAbout  50%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  India  is  generated  in  urban  areas, \nwhere  28%  of  the  population  lives.  The  estimated  per  capita  productivity  ratio  between  the \nurban and rural populations is 7:3. This suggests that economic growth is dependent on urban \nareas  and  their  ability  to  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity.  The  major  cities  of \nMadhya  Pradesh  have  great  potential  for  economic  growth.  Not  only  are  they  the  centers  for \ntrading and commercial activities of the districts, but they are also becoming tourist hubs due to \nthree  World  Heritage  sites4  and  several  cities  considered  extraordinary  for  their  architectural \nand scenic beauty. However, poor urban infrastructure and services are major constraints to the \nexpansion of trade, commerce, and tourism, leading to economic inefficiency. \n \n4. \nWhen the initial assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was proposed in 2003 \nin the largest cities of Madhya Pradesh\u2014Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur\u2014water supply \ndid not meet standard requirements, as it was being supplied for only a few hours a day in the \nwet  season  and  less  than  an  hour  every  other  day  in  the  dry  season.  Without  urgent \ninterventions, the average water supply would have been less than 40 liters per capita per day \n(lpcd) by 2010, which was well below the minimum standard of 70 lpcd set by the Government \nof India. In addition, in Bhopal, Gwalior, and Indore, the existing sewerage systems covered less \nthan 10% of the population, resulting in unhygienic living conditions and public health problems. \nInadequate  solid-waste  management  was  evident  in  the  largest  cities;  streets,  drainage \nchannels, and open areas were littered with waste. Residents and businesses felt the situation \nwas intolerable as it affected public health and tourist perceptions of the cities. \n \n5. \nTo  mitigate  the  deteriorating  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the  largest  cities,  the \nUrban  Administration  and  Development  Department  of  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh, \ndeveloped  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental  Improvement  in  Madhya  Pradesh \nProject in 2003 with the help of ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). ADB\u2019s \nloan  appraisal  mission  visited  Madhya  Pradesh  in  2003,  and  assessed  the  financial \nsustainability,  economic  viability,  and  safeguards  requirements  of  the  investment  for  urban \n                                                 \n1   A revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. This design and monitoring framework was revised \nbased on the Project Framework for the initial loan in ADB. 2003.

The revision was to meet the current new format and content requirements. \n\n2  The states of Bhopal, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh. \n3  The  southern  portion  of  the  state  was  carved  off  to  form  the  new  state  of  Chhattisgarh  in  November  2000  as  a \n\nresult of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act. \n\n4   The Khajuraho Group of Monuments, including the Devi Jagadambi temple, became a World Heritage site in 1986, \nthe Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi were listed in 1989, and the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka were listed in 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\ninfrastructure improvement. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nTo help the government of Madhya  Pradesh achieve the goal of sustainable economic \n6. \ngrowth and poverty reduction in the largest cities of Madhya Pradesh, ADB approved a loan for \nfinancing the project for $200 million in December 2003. The project5 would achieve the goal by \n(i)  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  people  to  environmental  degradation,  poverty,  and  natural \nhazards;  and  (ii)  increasing  economic  opportunities  in  the  largest  cities through  improving  (a) \nwater supply services, (b) sewerage and sanitation services, (c) storm-water drainage, (d) solid-\nwaste management services, and (e) slums and poor settlements. \n \n7. \n \n\nThe project comprises three parts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPart  A:  Urban  water  supply  and  environmental  improvement.  This  covers  the \nimprovement  and  expansion  of  the  following  municipal  infrastructure  and \nservices:  (a)  urban  water  supply,  (b)  sewerage  and  sanitation,  (c)  storm-water \ndrainage, and (d) solid-waste management. \nPart  B:  Public  participation  and  awareness  program.  This  consists  of  (a)  two \ncommunity  funds  that  will  be  the  basis  for  participatory  planning  between  the \nmunicipal authorities and the poor communities of the neighborhood to integrate \nslum  improvements  with  citywide  infrastructure,  and  (b)  the  Water  for  Asian \nCities  Program  in  India  covering  urban  water  conservation  and  demand \nmanagement  to  be  financed  through  parallel  cofinancing  by  the  United  Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT). These activities were designed \nto  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  project  cities  to  plan  and  manage  urban \ndevelopment in a more effective, transparent, and sustainable manner. \nPart  C:  Project  implementation  assistance.  This  consists  of  support  to  the  state \nproject management unit (PMU) and the city project implementation units (PIUs) \nwith activities immediately related to the implementation of the project. \n\n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n8. \nThe total cost of the project was initially estimated at $303.5 million equivalent (including \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $17.4  million  equivalent).  To  meet  the  estimated  project  cost,  the \nGovernment  initially  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  $200.0  million,  which  represented \n65.9% of the total cost of the project, from its ordinary capital resources (OCR). The loan had a \n25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  0.75%  per  annum \ncommitment  charge,  a  0.5%  front-end  fee,  conversion  options  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nConversion Guidelines,6 and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. UN-HABITAT provided and administered parallel grant cofinancing of $0.5 million. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   As a result of the Staff Instructions on Project Classification on 7 December 2004, the targeting classification of the \ninitial  loan  was  revised  from  \u201cpoverty  intervention\u201d  to  \u201ctargeted  intervention-M.\u201d  The  project  benefits  from  (i) \nimprovements in water supply, sanitation, and garbage collection and disposal within the project cities; and (ii) the \nconstruction of a tertiary water distribution network, and community latrines inside the slum settlements. It will also \ncontribute  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  7:  Ensure  environmental  sustainability  in  an  inclusive \nmanner. \n\n6   ADB. 2008.

Manila  \n\n\fThe  Borrower  was  India  and  the  foreign  exchange  risk  was  borne  by  the  Government. \n9. \nThe  Government  was  to  pass  the  initial  loan  to  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  as  70% \ndebt and 30% grant. The government of Madhya Pradesh was to onlend the full amount of the \nloan  portion  to  the  municipal  corporations  in  rupees  equivalent  at  10.5%  per  annum  with \nrepayments over 25 years including a grace period of 5 years. The grant portion was passed on \nto the government of Madhya Pradesh as a grant.  \n \n10. \nIn September 2004 before the loan signing, however, the Government requested ADB to \ncancel  $19  million  of  the  loan  amount.  This  was  because  two  out  of  the  six  municipal \ncorporations, namely Uijain and Ratlam, decided to opt out of such onlending arrangements. As \na  result  of  the  withdrawal,  the  total  project  cost  was  reduced  by  9%  to  $275.0  million.  After \nthorough  assessment,  ADB  approved  a  reduction  in  the  project  scope  and  cancellation  of  the \nloan  amount  by  $19  million.  The  loan  and  project  agreements  were  signed  in  March  2005  for \n$181.0 million.

Despite initial slow progress of project implementation, the executing agency \n(EA)  is  strongly  committed  and  project  implementation  is  now  progressing  rapidly,  as  seen  in \nthe  expeditious  tendering  and  implementation  of  contracts  since  2007.  This  was  a  result  of  a \nmajor business process reengineering undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh from \nlate 2006 to streamline business procedures. The new business process became the strength of \nthe  project,  and  it  provided  lessons  to  other  projects  in  India.  The  effectiveness  of  the  reform \nwas  reflected  in  the  record  of  contract  awards.  By  2006,  only  $16.7  million  worth  of  contracts \nwere  awarded  out  of  the  $181.0  million  loan  proceeds. 7  However,  by  December  2007,  the \ncontracts  awarded  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  reached  approximately  $172.5  million.  In  other \nwords, the EA awarded contracts worth $155.8 million out of the loan proceeds in 2007 alone. \nThe social and environmental safeguards and the gender action plan are being complied with. \n(Appendix  2  provides  the  midterm  review  of  implementation  status.)  Notwithstanding  this \nachievement,  there  is  still  $81.7  million  worth  of  works  and  supply  contract  packages  that \nremain  to  be  awarded  in  order  to  complete  the  original  scope  of  the  project.  Thus,  there  is  a \nserious financing shortfall. \n \n12. \nInitial Weaknesses. The project was the first large-scale investment for the government \nof Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations. At the beginning of project implementation, \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations had no option but to use the \nexisting  project  implementation  procedures,  which  were  designed  for  locally  financed  projects \ninvolving  works  and  supply  contracts  worth  less  than  $100,000  each;  the  project,  however, \ninvolved contracts worth at least $2 million. This resulted in a lengthy decision-making process \nwithin the government of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations. Also, the use of the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s schedule of rates (state-imposed ceilings on prices that were \nperiodically updated but did not necessarily reflect market rates) has led to substantial variation \nin  bid  prices  from  the  cost  estimate  of  larger  contract  packages.  A  substantial  difference \nbetween the cost estimate and the bid price called for rebidding. Some contractors became very \ncautious  about  the  larger  contracts  with  the  municipal  corporations,  as  the  impact  of  payment \ndelay on their cash flow would become bigger if the amount of each payment was larger. \n \nAll  of  the  weaknesses  (lengthy  decision  making  and  inaccurate  cost  estimates)  were \n13. \ninterconnected, and put project implementation into a vicious cycle of uncertainty and risk. Slow \ndecision making not only caused delay in contract awards but also late payment to contractors. \nWhen contractors wanted to tender despite various risks, they had to hedge their future risk by \n                                                 \n7  The contract award figures represent the value of the contracts which will be financed out of the loan proceeds in \naccordance with Schedule 3 of the loan agreement, and does not include the remaining portion to be financed by the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh and municipal corporations. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nasking for a higher return. In other words, the risk premium pushed the bid price even higher. \nHigher bid prices resulted in the increased likelihood of rejection of all bids. Uncertainty in the \ntiming  of  contract  award  undermined  business  confidence,  which \nfurther  discouraged \ncontractors\u2019 interest in the business opportunities. As a result, it was October 2006 before the \nmajor  works  contract  was  awarded.  The  cumulative  contract  award  amount  for  the  initial  20 \nmonths\u2014from the loan effectiveness in May 2005 to December 2006\u2014was virtually stagnant at \napproximately $16.7 million. \n \nBusiness  Process  Reengineering.  Collaborative  and  continuous  efforts  of  the  EA\u2019s \n14. \nPMU and ADB since 2005 started to bear fruit in 2007. The PMU realized it was imperative to \nbreak  the  vicious  cycle  in  project  implementation,  and  reformed  its  business  procedures  and \ncustoms in early 2007 on its own initiative. It introduced major reforms in three areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nQuick decision making. Initially, the decision on contract approval by municipal \ncorporations  was  made  through  a  municipal  corporation\u2019s  official  meeting \nattended by more than 50 elected local representatives every 2 months. After the \nreform, decision-making authority was delegated to the mayor-in-council of each \nmunicipal  corporation.8  Also,  before  issuance  of  official  correspondence  to  the \nPMU,  the  concerned  officers  of  the  PIUs  and  municipal  corporations  held \npreliminary dialogue to reach consensus. Once consensus was reached, official \nletters were sent to seek official approval from the respective PIUs, the PMU, and \nthe  municipal  corporations.  This  has  substantially  reduced  the  decision-making \ntime. \n \nReliable  costing  during  detailed  engineering  design.  In  the  early  project \nimplementation  period,  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  used  a  schedule  of \nrates  for  the  purpose  of  cost  estimates  and  evaluation  of  bids  which  did  not \nreflect  market  prices.  Moreover,  factors  which  would  raise  the  construction \ncosts\u2014such as locations, climates, soil conditions, and availability of construction \nmaterials\u2014were  not  taken  into  consideration.  As  a  result,  bid  prices  were \nsubstantially  higher  than  the  estimates.  To  minimize  underestimation  and/or \noverestimation errors, adequate steps have been taken, including (a) the use of \nan  updated  schedule  of  rates  and  market  rates  where  applicable,  and  (b) \nconsideration  for  factors  which  would  vary  the  construction  costs.  Increased \naccuracy in costing has given the empowered committee (the highest approving \nauthority  under  the  project)  more  confidence  in  the  PMU\u2019s  estimates  and \ndecisions,  and  has  resulted  in  faster  approval,  even  though  there  was  variance \nbetween the government of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s schedule of rates and the PMU\u2019s \nestimates. \n \nConfidence  building.  In  the  beginning  of  the  project,  there  was  a  general \nperception  among  suppliers  and  contractors  that  the  municipal  corporations \nwould  require  longer  to  process  payment  claims,  which  might  potentially  affect \nthe contractors\u2019 cash flow. When coupled with increasing business opportunities \nin  the  private  sector  in  the  booming  Indian  economy,  such  risks  discouraged \ncontractors  from  seeking  business  under  government-financed  projects  and \nresulted in no bids to initial tenders under the project. To change the perception, \n\n                                                 \n8  The mayor-in-council is made up of the mayor, deputy mayor, and up to 10 elected members of the council named \nby the mayor. The mayor-in-council collectively has executive powers of the corporation and functions as a cabinet. \nThe mayor allocates work of the corporation's departments to different council members in the same way that the \nchief minister of the state government allocates different portfolios to his cabinet ministers. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \n\nADB and the PMU jointly organized a series of workshops in the project cities to \nraise  the  awareness  of  potential  contractors.  This  helped  the  contractors  to \nunderstand  that  the  municipal  corporations  had  a  secure  fund  source  to  make \nimmediate  payment  to  contractors,  even  though  the  contract  sizes  were  larger. \nAlso,  the  PMU  made  a  commitment  to  pay  80%  of  the  claimed  payment  in  3 \ndays. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\n15. \nThe reason for the cost overrun is an increase in original cost estimates, caused mainly \nby  two  factors:  (i)  the  appreciation  of  the  rupee  against  the  dollar,  and  (ii)  price  escalation  of \nconstruction materials in India. Initial slow startup of project implementation also had an adverse \neffect on the two factors. Out of the financing gap estimated at $108 million, rupee appreciation \naccounts for $77 million and the price escalation for about $31 million. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nAppreciation  of  the  rupee.  The  project  cost  was  estimated  in  rupees  and \nconverted  to  dollars  using  the  exchange  rates  forecast  at  the  time  of  the  loan \nappraisal  in  2003.  The  value  of  $1  throughout  project  implementation  was \nestimated  at  Rs50  during  the  appraisal  of  the  initial  loan.  However,  it  sharply \nreduced to Rs40 by May 2007, and has remained close to that level throughout \nthe appraisal of the supplementary loan. In other words, the original project cost \nin dollars increased by $77 million, from $275 million to $352 million. Accordingly, \nto  maintain  the  ADB  financing  amount  in  rupees,  the  loan  amount  in  dollars \nneeds  to  be  increased  by  $50.6  million,  from  $181.0  million  to  $231.6  million. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange \nfluctuation. \n\nEscalation  of  construction  material  prices. By the time of the major contract \nawards  in  2007,  the  unit  costs  of  goods  and  materials  had  risen  significantly \nsince  the  original  cost  estimates  for  the  project  were  prepared  in  2003.9  High \ndemand  for  construction  materials  in  the  booming  Indian  economy 10   and  a \nworldwide increase in oil prices have led to high price escalation of construction \nmaterials. Based on the revised cost estimates, the overall increase in the project \ncost  in  rupees  is  Rs1.2  billion  (a  9%  increase),  equivalent  to  $31  million.  While \nthe  average  annual  inflation  rate,  based  on  India\u2019s  wholesale  price  index,  was \naround  5.5%  during  2003\u20132007,  there  was  a  significant  price  increase  in \nconstruction  materials\u2014the  price  index  of  steel  increased  by  11.6%,  cement \nincreased  by  9.8%,  and  fuel  increased  9.3%  per  year  on  average.  The \ngovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  requested  ADB  through  the  Government  to \nfinance the increment at the same proportional rate as it had the initial loan (i.e., \n\n                                                 \n9  An  assessment  was  also  made  to  identify  whether  the  cost  overrun  was  also  caused  by  underestimations  of  the \ninput  cost.  In  urban  projects  there  are  generally  some  variations  in  contract  price  estimates  between  the  PPTA \ndetailed  engineering  design  stages.  This  is  because  more  detailed  engineering  and  market  data  after  the  PPTA \nimprove the accuracy of unit price estimates. Under this project, the impact of the unit price adjustment on the total \ncost  after  detailed  engineering  design  was  not  significant  and,  if  it  had  been  the  only  change,  could  have  been \naccommodated through the physical contingencies provision. Appendix 4 provides a comparison between contract \nprice estimates at the PPTA stage and the bid results. \n\n10  The construction component of the gross domestic product (GDP) in India increased by 10.7% to 14.2% per year \nbetween  2003  and  2007,  while  the  manufacturing  component  increased  by  6.6%  to  12.3%,  and  the  services \ncomponent increased by 8.9% to 11.9%. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n$20.4  million,  which  is  65.8%  of  $31  million).  Appendix  3  provides  a  detailed \nanalysis of the impact of price escalation. \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project  \n\n16. \nUndermining  System  Integrity.  There  were  approximately  120  major  contracts  under \nthe original scope of the project. From the total number of contracts, the PMU allotted the initial \nloan to finance about 80 of the contracts. The government of Madhya Pradesh has to search for \nadditional  resources  to  finance  the  remaining  40  contracts.  Without  implementation  of  the \nremaining  contracts,  system  integrity  of  the  urban  infrastructure  will  be  severely  undermined. \nFor  example,  the  augmented  water  production  system  of  Indore  and  Jabalpur  cannot  be  fully \nutilized  in  the  absence  of  a  reliable  water  distribution  system  in  the  existing  and  new  areas. \nSewage collected from the new sewerage network system in Gwalior will have no option but to \nflow into the river without treatment if there is no sewage treatment system. Conversely, there \nwill  be  no  sewage  to  be  treated  in  the  sewage  treatment  plant  in  Bhopal  without  the  new \nsewerage  networks  system.  Similarly,  while  more  urban  waste  will  be  collected  using  new \nequipment, such collected waste will not be properly and safely disposed of in the absence of \nsanitary landfill sites. Supplementary Appendix A presents the existing and pending works in a \ngraphical way to illustrate systemic integrity. \n \nReduction in Beneficiaries. An incomplete system of urban infrastructure will result in a \n17. \nreduction in the number of beneficiaries (Table 3). Across the sector, not only will there be about \na  35%  reduction  in  the  number  of  beneficiaries,  but  also  beneficiaries  will  be  connected  to \nincomplete  systems  of  urban  infrastructure.  In  particular,  the  number  of  beneficiaries  of  water \nsupply  optimization  will  be  reduced  by  46%,  and  the  number  of  beneficiaries  of  water  supply \nexpansion will be reduced by 38%.  \n \n\nTable 3: Estimated Number of Project Beneficiaries by Scenario \n(million) \n\nItem \nWater supply optimization\nWater supply expansion \nSewerage and drainage \nSolid waste management \n\nComplete Scope \n5.6  \n1.3  \n1.6  \n4.7  \n\nIncomplete Scope \n3.0 \n0.8 \n1.2 \n3.6 \n\nSource:  Project  management  unit  estimates  based  on  baseline  report  by  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation consultants, April 2007 \n\n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\n18. \nImplications  for  Economic  Viability  and  Financial  Sustainability.  According  to  the \ninitial economic and financial analyses undertaken during the loan appraisal in 2003,11 there are \nserious  implications  of  the  reduction  in  the  beneficiaries  on  economic  viability  and  financial \nsustainability. Being a high priority project, these pending works will have to be carried out by \nthe  municipal  corporations  in  any  case,  but  it  is  not  clear  when  the  government  of  Madhya \nPradesh  and  the  municipal  corporations  can  secure  the  full  funds.  Therefore,  there  will  be  a \ndelay in the realization of the full benefit for an unknown period. The sensitivity analysis of the \ninitial economic analysis shows that, although the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of \nmost of the subprojects in adverse conditions were higher than the economic opportunity cost of \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. Manila (Appendixes 11 \nand 13). \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\ncapital  (EOCC),12  the  extent  of  reduction  in  the  EIRR  is  higher  for  a  1-year  delay  in  benefit \n(19%\u201345%) than for a 10% capital cost increase (7%\u201322%). Similarly, the sensitivity analysis of \nthe initial financial analysis shows that, while most of the subprojects earned a financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),13 the extent of \nreduction in the FIRR is higher for a 1-year delay in benefit (13%\u201368%) than for a 10% capital \ncost increase (3%\u201368%). If the realization of benefit is delayed for more than 1 year, the extent \nof  benefit  reduction  will  become  greater.  In  other  words,  there  is  a  clear  indication  that \ncompletion  of  the  full  scope  of  the  project  is  more  financially  sustainable  and  economically \nviable  than  leaving  the  project  incomplete  for  an  unknown  period  until  the  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations identify new funding sources to complete the \nproject. \n \nSearch  for  Financial  Resources.  ADB  officially  warned  of  the  possible  risk  of  a  cost \n19. \noverrun  in  mid-2007  and  the  PMU  was  already  aware  that  it  would  not  be  able  to  award  new \ncontracts  from  early  2008  due  to  exhaustion  of  loan  proceeds,  and  that  this  would  result  in  a \ndelay  to  project  implementation.  The  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  did  not  have  enough \nfinancial capacity to finance the remaining scope in a short period, as it had been in a fiscally \nweak position for several years. The municipal corporations had cash surpluses, but these were \ntoo small to meet the investment cost. As the project is a priority of the government of Madhya \nPradesh  and  in  order  to  complete  the  original  project  scope,  the  municipal  corporations  in \nassociation  with  the  PMU  actively  looked  for  additional  financial  resources  in  2007.  They \nconsequently identified three financial sources for the works related to about 10 contracts: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nGovernment grants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n(JNNURM)  to  finance  a  large  portion  of  works  for  the  sewerage  networks  in \nIndore, \nGovernment  grants  under  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for \nSmall and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) to finance a large portion of works for the \nsewerage network and the sewage treatment plant in Gwalior, and \nthe  municipal  corporations\u2019  own  budget  to  finance  some  contracts  for  water \nsupply  optimization  in  Gwalior  and  a  large  portion  of  works  related  to  sanitary \nlandfill development in Bhopal. \n\n \n20. \nFinancial  Position  of  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Municipal \nCorporations.  Since  mid-2007,  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  assessed  various \nborrowing  options  to  secure  financial  resources  for  the  remaining  30  contracts.  The  municipal \ncorporations\u2019  financial  capacity  has  been  improving,  yet  is  still  weak;  high  costs  of  borrowing \nmight  jeopardize  the  municipal  corporations\u2019  efforts  to  improve  their  financial  position.  The \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations compared the cost of borrowing \nbetween  ADB  loans  and  other  development  loans  in  India,  and  found  that  while  the \ndevelopment loans were as competitive as ADB loans in pricing, ADB loans had the advantage \nof a longer repayment period with a grace period. Further, the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand  the  municipal  corporations  recognized  value-additions  of  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance, \nespecially  ADB\u2019s  emphasis  on  collaborative  capacity  building  through  sharing  of  successful \nexperiences  in  other  projects  in  India  and  the  region,  and  exposure  to  urban  services \nmanagement  in  advanced  economies  in  Asia.  The  PMU  decided  to  finance  the  remaining  30 \n                                                 \n12 In  the  original  economic  analysis,  water  supply  in  Indore,  sewerage  and  sanitation  in  Gwalior  and  Jabalpur,  and \nsolid-waste management in Gwalior were lower than the economic opportunity cost of capital in adverse conditions. \n13 In the original financial analysis, water supply in Indore; sewerage and sanitation in Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur; \nand  solid-waste  management  in  Bhopal  and  Jabalpur  were  lower  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  in \nadverse conditions. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ncontracts from an additional ADB loan, and the government of Madhya Pradesh made an official \nrequest for supplementary financing to ADB through the Government in early 2008. \n \n21. \nImplementation  Readiness.  Out  of  the  remaining  contracts  (of  which  there  are  about \n30), nine are ready to be awarded14 expecting ADB\u2019s retroactive financing. Detailed engineering \ndesign  will  be  completed  for  eight  contracts  before  September  2008  and  for  all  remaining \ncontracts before January 2009. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates  \n\n22. \nRevised  costs  for  the  project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $383 million including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation.  Table  4  summarizes  the  revised \ncost estimates for the project. Details of revised cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 4: Revised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nRevised Costa\n \n\nPart A: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement \nPart B: Public Participation and Awareness Program \nPart C: Implementation Assistance \n\nItem \nA.

With an additional $71 million proposed under the supplementary loan from ADB\u2019s OCR, \nthe total available ADB loan amount will be $252 million. The repayments of the supplementary \nOCR  loan  will  be  fully  synchronized  with  the  repayments  of  the  initial  loan.  Consequently,  the \nsupplementary  OCR  loan  will  have  a  term  of  20  years,  no  grace  period,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \n\n                                                 \n14 Procurements  are  being  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from \n\ntime to time). \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s \nown independent decision and not in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n24. \nUnder  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  two  ADB  loans  will  cover  65.8%  ($252 \nmillion)  of  the  total  investment  costs  of  $383  million.  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  will \ncover  65.7%  ($71  million)  of  the  additional  financing  requirement  of  $108  million,  which  will \nfinance a portion of civil works, equipment, consulting services, and funds for municipal action \nplanning  for  poverty  reduction.  The  financing  charges  during  implementation  will  not  be \ncapitalized in the ADB loans. Of the total investment costs, the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand  municipal  corporations  will  finance  34.1%,  which  will  include  incremental  administration, \nfinancial  charges,  taxes  and  duties,  land,  and  a  portion  of  civil  works,  equipment,  consulting \nservices,  and  funds  for  municipal  action  planning  for  poverty  reduction.  The  UN-HABITAT  will \ncontinue  financing  0.1%  ($0.5  million)  of  the  total  investment  cost  through  parallel  grant \ncofinancing for implementation of the Water for Asian Cities Program. The proposed financing \nplan is summarized in Table 5. \n \n\nTable 5: Revised Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources: Initial financing \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Supplementary financing \nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh and Municipal Corporations \n\nInitial financing \nSupplementary financing \n\nUnited Nations Human Settlement Programme \nTotal \n\n$ Million \n \n181.0  \n71.0  \n\n93.5  \n37.0  \n0.5  \n383.0  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPercent \n \n\n47.3  \n18.5  \n\n24.4  \n9.7  \n0.1  \n100.0  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n\n \n25. \nThe  Government  of  India  will  pass  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  on  to  the \ngovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  on  the  same  terms  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh will then onlend a portion of the loan to the municipal corporations on similar \nterms and conditions as that for the initial loan to be synchronous with the initial loan repayment \nperiod. The existing onlending agreement, signed between the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand  the  municipal  corporations,  will  be  revised,  as  acceptable  to  ADB,  limited  to  reflect  the \nchanges arising from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \nF. \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n26. \nVarious  remedial  measures  are  already  in  place  through  the  collaborative  effort  of  the \nPMU and ADB to achieve timely implementation and reliable costing as described earlier. The \neffectiveness of the remedial measures was reflected in the amount of contract awards in 2007. \nTo prevent further cost overruns, the EA will minimize the impact of (i) further price escalation \nby  awarding  about  $39  million  worth  of  contracts  through  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  in  2008,  and  the  remaining  contracts  in  2009;  and  (ii)  further  rupee  appreciation  by \nmaking  a  provision  for  larger  price  contingency,  the  majority  of  which  will  be  financed  by  the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  project  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan, \n27. \nincluding project management; procurement (a procurement plan is in Appendix 6); consulting \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nservices;  anticorruption  policy; 15   disbursement  arrangements;  accounting,  auditing,  and \nreporting; project performance monitoring and evaluation; and project review remain the same \nas those in the initial loan, as amended to date, except three specific aspects:16\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  The  EA  requested  ADB\u2019s \napproval of (a) advance contracting to recruit consultants and to procure goods \nand  civil  works;  and  (b)  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  20%  of  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  amount  for  eligible  expenditures,  including  consultants, \ngoods, and civil works, incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than 12 \nmonths  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing are necessary to avoid any disruption and to ensure smooth \nand  continuous  project  implementation.  The  EA  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  constitute  a \ncommitment  to  finance  the  supplementary  loan.  (Contracts  for  retroactive \nfinancing are indicated in the procurement plan.) \n\nRevised  implementation  period.  The  project  was  originally  expected  to  be \nimplemented over 5 years with a project completion date of 31 March 2009. The \nPMU  was unable to assign the design and construction supervision consultants \n(DSCs) to undertake further detailed engineering design for some of the pending \nworks  contracts.  It  was  only  when  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \napproached  ADB  through  the  Government  for  a  supplementary  loan  that  it  had \ngood  prospects  for  funding  sources  for  construction  activities.  Considering  the \ndelay  in  detailed  engineering  design,  the  completion  date  of  the  project  will  be \nextended  to  31  March  2011.  A  revised  implementation  schedule  is  included  in \nAppendix  7.  Accordingly,  the  project  completion  date  in  the  initial  loan  is  also \nproposed to be extended to 31 March 2011. \n\nContinuous  engagement  of  consultants. Under the initial loan for the project, \nan international consulting firm was engaged in 2005 as the project management \nconsultants and two national consulting firms as the DSC, and domestic firms as \npublic  relations  consultants  and  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  consultants, \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  quality-based  selection  procedures.  Existing  consultancy \ncontracts will expire in December 2009. The EA has found the performance of all \nfirms  to  be  satisfactory.  In  order  to  obtain  the  equivalent  level  of  consultants\u2019 \nassistance  during  the  extended  period  of  project  implementation,  additional \nconsulting  services  under  the  DSC  (1,417  person-months),  the  public  relations \nconsultancy  (116  person-months)  and \nthe  benefit  monitoring  evaluation \nconsultancy  (23  person-months)  contracts  will  be  required.  The  proposed \nadditional  consulting  services  may  be  provided  by  the  respective  currently \nengaged  firms  during  the  extended  project  implementation  period  through \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  again  with  the \nGovernment and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the project. \n16 The three aspects are not due to, and will not result in, a change in the original scope and/or design, or modified or \nincremental activities or components, but will facilitate implementation of the project during the transition between \nthe initial loan and supplementary financing. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n \n\nthrough  variation  orders \n\nvariation orders following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  applicable  provisions  set  forth  in  the \nrespective  contracts.  Continuous  assignment \nis \nconsidered  to  be  the  most  efficient  and  advantageous  method  for  extended \nengagement of the consultants because (a) selection of new consultants will put \nthe  project  on  hold  for  at  least  6  months  and  will  cause  further  delay;  (b)  the \nproposed  tasks  represent  a  natural  continuation  of  their  previous  work;  (c)  the \nterms of reference of respective consulting services will remain unchanged; and \n(d)  the  existing  consultants\u2019  professional  liabilities,  technical  approach,  and \napplication  of  the  experience  required  and  gained  will  be  continued.  When  the \nloan  proceeds  allocated  to  consulting  services  under  the  initial  loan  are \nexhausted, loan proceeds under the supplementary loan will continue to finance \nthe  existing  contracts  until  the  end  of  project  implementation.  The  estimated \nvariation  amounts  for  each  contract  are  not  more  than  50%  of  the  original \ncontract value in the currency of payment.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n28. \nThe increase in the original cost estimates was caused by rupee appreciation and price \nincreases. There is no (i) physical change within the original scope and/or design, or modified or \nincremental  activities  or  components;  and  (ii)  change  in  environment  and  social  safeguards \nrequirements.  Therefore,  the  project  benefit,  impacts,  assumptions,  and  risks  will  remain  the \nsame as the initial loan, except for the project impacts on financial sustainability and economic \nvalidity. \n \n29. \nFinancial  Sustainability. Financial analysis (Appendix 8) reassessed the sustainability \nof  all  revenue-generating  subprojects,  taking  the  revised  cost  estimates  and  the  rescheduled \nindicative financial improvement action plan (FIAP) into consideration. The WACC is estimated \nat 3.8%. The FIRRs in the base case are estimated at 3.5\u201312.9% for water supply subprojects, \nat  3.5\u20134.7%  for  the  sewerage  subproject,  and  6.4\u201318.5%  for  solid-waste  management \nsubprojects.  The  FIRRs  are  lower  than  the  WACC  for  sewerage  subprojects  in  Bhopal  and \nIndore.  These  subprojects  also  had  comparatively  lower  FIRRs  in  the  initial  financial  analysis. \nHowever, combined FIRRs for water supply and sewerage are all above the WACC. Despite the \nlow  level  of  the  FIRR,  the  sewerage  subprojects  in  Bhopal  and  Indore  will  generate  adequate \nrevenue  to  sustain  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to \ntest  the  robustness  of  the  financial  sustainability  to  changes  in  subproject  parameters.  The \nresults indicate that the FIRRs in all sectors are most sensitive to reduction in the incremental \nrevenue. This suggests that, in order to realize higher financial returns, (i) the planned coverage \nof  services  needs  to  be  achieved,  and  (ii)  the  rescheduled  indicative  FIAP  needs  to  be \nimplemented on time. \n \n30. \nThe initial indicative FIAP was formulated with a philosophy that people would not accept \nany tariff increase unless there were visible improvements in urban services. It was envisaged \nthat  major  tariff  increases  would  start  from  the  second  year  of  project  implementation,  when \nmore people became aware (through public awareness campaigns) of the value of better urban \ninfrastructure  for  maintaining  public  hygiene  at  a  higher  level,  and  some  new  urban \ninfrastructure became operational. In reality, however, it was only in the second half of 2007 that \nthe  majority  of  contracts  were  awarded  to  the  contractor.  Although  there  has  been  good \nprogress  in  implementation  of  works,  major  infrastructure  is  still  under  construction  and  will \nbecome operational after 2009. In order to implement the indicative FIAP with full understanding \nof  the  people  in  the  cities,  the  implementation  schedule  of  the  indicative  FIAP  was  revised  to \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nsynchronize with the progress of physical investment and the reform  agenda under JNNURM. \nWhile the final target year will be delayed by 1 year, there is no change in the final targets for \nthe user charges of various services from the initial indicative FIAP. The rescheduled indicative \nFIAP is presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n31. \nEconomic  Viability.  All  subprojects  are  economically  viable,  in  spite  of  the  cost \nincrease, with the estimated EIRR values exceeding the EOCC in all cases. Economic analysis \nis  presented  in  Appendix  9.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the \neconomic viability to changes in subproject parameters. The results indicate that the EIRRs are \nsensitive  to  a  1-year  delay  in  realization  of  the  economic  benefits  in  some  subprojects  and  a \nreduction in beneficiary levels in other subprojects. This suggests that, in order to realize higher \neconomic benefits, (i) timely completion of works and smooth transition to operation are crucial, \nand (ii) the planned coverage of services needs to be achieved. \n \n32. \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the increased costs. \n \n\nReassessment  of  financial  sustainability  and  economic  variability  suggest  that  the \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nIn  addition  to  the  assurances  set  forth  in  the  amended  and  restated  Loan  Agreement, \nand  the  Project  Agreement,  dated  9  March  2005,  both  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental  Improvement  in  Madhya  Pradesh  Project,  the  Government  of  India  and  the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in \nthe legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  of  India  will  make  available  to  the  government  of  Madhya \nPradesh  the  proceeds  of  the  financing  provided  by  ADB.  The  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh commits to bear the foreign exchange risk for such proceeds of \nthe financing provided by the Government of India. \nThe  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  will  ensure  that  the  existing  onlending \nagreement,  signed  between  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the \nmunicipal corporations, may be revised to reflect the changes, if any, but limited \nto stipulating for the Loan amount arising from the proposed supplementary loan. \nThe  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  will  cause \nthe  Project  municipal \ncorporations to ensure that sufficient funds will be provided to meet any shortfall \nbetween  the  cost  of  and  revenues  for  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  the \ninfrastructure assets created under the Project. \nThe  EA  shall  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts 17   under  the  Project  follow  all \napplicable labor laws of the Government of India and the government of Madhya \nPradesh,  and  that  these  further  include  provisions  to  the  effect  that  contractors \n(a)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  laborers,  and  disseminate \ninformation at worksites on risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS \nas  part  of  health  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during  construction; \nand  (b)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor  (including  not \nemploying or using children as laborers, equal pay for equal work), health, safety, \nwelfare,  sanitation,  and  working  conditions.  Such  contracts  shall  also  include \n\n                                                 \n17 The  EA  agreed  that  the  requirements  of  this  assurance  will  be  incorporated  in  the  contracts  advertized  after  the \nfact-finding  mission  by  modifying  the  standard  bid  documents.  All  contracts  advertized  before  the  fact-finding \nmission will incorporate the requirements of this assurance during contract negotiations. \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nclauses for termination by the government of Madhya Pradesh and/or EA in case \nof any breach of the stated provisions by the contractors. \nThe government of Madhya Pradesh will ensure that loan proceeds allocated for \nthe  area  improvement  fund  and  the  community  initiative  fund  will  not  be \nreallocated until each Project municipal corporation awards a contract under the \narea improvement fund and/or community initiative fund. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary  loan  of  $71,000,000  to  India  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental \nImprovement in Madhya Pradesh Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  20  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n19 September 2008 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n15\n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nImpact \nEconomic growth \nenhanced in a \nsustainable \nmanner, and \npoverty reduced in \nthe four municipal \ncorporations of \nMadhya Pradesh. \n \n \n\n \nBy end of the project period (2011): \n\u2022  Per capita real income increased \nin the four municipal corporations \nby 5%. \n\n\u2022  Percentages of below poverty \nline households in the project \ntowns reduced to less than 2008 \nlevel. \n\n\u2022  Employment increased in the \n\nproject towns and state overall. \n\n\u2022  Perception of urban service \namong town residents, and \nparticularly the poor, improved. \n\n \n\u2022  National and state \n\n\u2022  Economic review \n\nstatistics \n\npapers \n\n\u2022  Census data \n\u2022  Project completion \n\nreports \n\nOutcome \nThe four municipal \ncorporations \nreduce vulnerability \nof people to \nenvironmental \ndegradation, \npoverty, and \nnatural hazards, \nand increase \neconomic \nopportunities. \n\n \n\u2022  Census data \n\u2022  State finance \n\ncommission reports \n\n\u2022  Annual reports of \n\nmunicipal corporations \n\n\u2022  Progress reports \n\u2022  ADB\u2019s loan review \n\nmission \n\n\u2022  Resettlement and \nenvironmental \nmonitoring reports \n\u2022  Project completion \n\nreports \n\n \nBy end of the project period (2011), \nthe four municipal corporations \nhave: \n\u2022  Recovered operation and \n\nmaintenance costs from user \ncharges in accordance with \nrescheduled FIAP. \n\n\u2022  Provided 24-hour access to \n\ntreated water supply at 135 lpcd \nto 5.6 million people (83% of the \npopulation of the project towns). \n\n\u2022  Provided access to sewerage \nand sanitation to 1.6 million \npeople (24% of total population \nof the project towns). \n\n\u2022  Reduced the volume of waste \n\nwater discharged to storm drains \nby 60%. \n\n\u2022  Provided flood protection to 1.1 \nmillion people (16% of total \npopulation of the project towns). \n\n\u2022  Provided solid-waste \n\nmanagement services with \nsanitary disposal to 4.7 million \npeople (70% of the total \npopulation of the project towns). \n\u2022  Provided basic urban services to \npeople residing in 75 slum areas. \n\n\u2022  Provided livelihood programs \nand infrastructure to the poor, \nmarginalized, and vulnerable \ngroups. \n\n \nBy end of the project period (2011), \nthe  residents  of  the  four  municipal \ncorporations have: \n\u2022  Reduced water expense from \n\n2003 levels. \n\n\u2022  Reduced waterborne disease \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022 \n\nImprovement in urban \nservices results in \nbetter productivity \nleading to economic \ndevelopment. \n\u2022  Economic growth \nleads to income \ngrowth.

STATUS \n \n \n\nBackground \n\nProject Management \n\nA. \n \n1. \nA midterm review mission visited Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur in February and \nMarch  2008  to  assess  the  implementation  progress  of  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. This appendix summarizes the major \nfindings of the midterm review. \n \nB. \n \nThe  highest  decision-making  authority  of  the  project,  the  empowered  committee,  was \n2. \nformed  in  2004  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  chief  secretary  of  the  government  of  Madhya \nPradesh.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  was  established  under  the  executing  agency \n(EA), the Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD), in 2005 to manage the \noverall  implementation  of  the  project.  A  steering  committee  was  formed  in  2004  in  each \nmunicipal  corporation  to  guide  each  subproject,  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  were \nestablished in each municipal corporation in 2005 to implement the project. All consultants\u2014the \nproject  management  consultants,  two  groups  of  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nrelations \nconsultants, \nconsultants\u2014were fielded in 2006. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nBhopal.  There were 24 works contracts under implementation, and five contracts to be \nawarded  (Table  A2.1).  All  designs  reflected  the  least-cost  analysis  undertaken  during  ADB\u2019s \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  The  works  were  being  executed  as  per \ncontract conditions with good quality-control. The midterm review noted slow progress of works \nrelated to (i) the sewage treatment plant at Maholi Dhamkheda; (ii) the laying of sanitary sewers; \nand  (iii)  the  laying  of  distribution  networks  in  wards  1,  2,  3,  and  4.  Particularly,  delay  in \nproduction of distribution pipes requires urgent attention. The contractors will prepare a revised \nimplementation schedule in consultation with the PIU. \n \n\nPart A: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement  \n\nthe  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  consultants,  and \n\nthe  public \n\nTable A2.1: Status of Contract Awards in Bhopal \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nItem \nWater Supply \nSewerage, Drainage, and \nSanitation \nSolid Waste Management  \n \n\nTotal \n\n \nNo. \n10 \n3 \n\n11 \n24 \n\n \nContracts Awarded \nRs \n$ \n(million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  No. \n\nBids under \nProcess \nRs \n    $ \n(million) \n110 \n227 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  No. \n\nBids to be \nInvited \n Rs \n   $ \n (million) \n4.2\n165 \n0\n \n\n526 \n605 \n\n53 \n1,184 \n\n13.5 \n15.5 \n\n1.4 \n30.4 \n\n2 \n1 \n\n0 \n3 \n\n0 \n337 \n\n2.8  \n5.8  \n\n0  \n8.6  \n\n2 \n0 \n\n0 \n2 \n\n \n165 \n\n0\n4.2\n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n4. \nGwalior. There were nine works contracts under implementation and six contracts to be \nawarded  (Table  A2.2).  All  designs  reflected  the  least-cost  analysis  undertaken  during  ADB\u2019s \nPPTA. The works were being executed as per contract conditions with good quality-control. The \nmidterm  review  noted  that  the  performance  of  the  works  related  to  (i)  the  raw  water  pumping \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n\nstation and the water treatment plant; (ii) the raw water pumping main and clear water pumping \nmain; and (iii) rehabilitation of the existing water treatment plants and pumping station, need to \nfurther  improve  by  deploying  additional  resources  to  complete  the  works  in  time.

Indore had the largest financial allocation under the project. Augmentation of the \nwater supply was the major component. Works involved construction of a raw water intake with \npumping station, a water treatment plant, three new clear water pumping stations, the laying of \n25  km  of  rising  mains,  55  km  of  gravity  mains,  and  distribution  networks  with  balancing \nreservoirs. All designs reflected the least-cost analysis undertaken during ADB\u2019s PPTA. There \nwere  28  works  contracts  under  implementation  and  12  contracts  to  be  awarded  (Table  A2.3). \nDespite the number of contracts, the works were executed as per contract conditions with good \nquality-control. Considering efficient contract management and supervision of the PIU in Indore, \nthere is a good prospect for completion of works on time. \n \n\n0  \n5.8  \n\n0 \n435 \n\n0\n11.2\n\n0 \n5 \n\nTable A2.3: Status of Contract Awards in Indore \n \n\n  \n\nContracts Awarded \n\n \n\n \n\nBids to be Invited \n\nBids under \nProcess \n Rs \n\n \n\n \n  No. \n \n \n\n3 \n0 \n\n     $ \n  (million) \n284\n0\n\n \n\n \n  No. \n\nRs \n  (million) \n\n $ \n\nRs \n\n$ \n\n \nNo. \n17 \n1 \n\nTotal \n\n10 \n28 \n\n (million) \n\n7.3  \n0  \n\n4,453 \n14 \n\n114.2 \n0.4 \n\nItem \nWater Supply \nSewerage, Drainage, and \nSanitation \n0\nSolid-Waste Management  \n284\n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \nJabalpur.

The Water for Asian Cities (WAC) program1 \n7. \nwas a joint collaboration between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) to catalyze investments into urban water supply \nand sanitation for the poor. The WAC program mainly consisted of capacity-building programs, \nsmall-scale projects, and studies related to water and sanitation management. For example, it \nhas undertaken the setting-up of water-sanitation classrooms to share knowledge on sanitation \nwith  juveniles.  The  WAC  program  particularly  benefited  the  project  through  implementing  pilot \nprojects on (i) community-based water supply schemes; and (ii) community toilets schemes in \nslums,  with  participation  of  the  local  communities.  These  schemes  are  operational  and  are \nmanaged  by  community  groups  of  local  women.  The  WAC  program  has  also  organized  a \nworkshop on water demand-management strategies to raise awareness among the people and \nthe  municipal  corporation  staff  on  metering,  leak  detection  and  repair,  rationalization  of  tariffs, \nand accounting and billing reforms. \n \nFunds  for  Municipal  Action  Planning  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  EA  initially \n8. \ndeferred activities of the area improvement fund and community initiatives fund as similar work \nwas  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Services  Program,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. In April 2007, however, the EA decided to implement the \narea improvement fund and the community initiatives fund, using the methodology established \nby the WAC program. The PMU has proposed to implement 10 community toilets schemes in \nBhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur, and has identified slums for implementation. Community \ngroups of local women would oversee operation and maintenance of these toilets based on user \ncharges.  During  the  site  visits  to  the  proposed  slums,  all  the  women  members  of  registered \ngroups showed their keenness to be associated with the project. The engineering design would \nbe developed with assistance of the respective PIUs. Works would be executed by contractors \nunder supervision of the local women resident committees. The PMU would submit the concept \nreport by the end of April 2008 to ADB for clearance. Due to paucity of funds, these works were \nproposed to be taken up under the supplementary loan. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nPublic  Relations  and  Awareness  Program.  In  each  project  city,  the  PIU  conducted \npublic awareness campaigns and participatory programs in compliance with loan covenants. As \npart  of  the  scope  of  the  project,  an  awareness  campaign  was  undertaken  through  various \n\nPart C: Implementation Assistance \n\n                                                 \n1   UN-Habitat. 2003.

Beneficiaries \nhave also been made aware of citizens' responsibilities to avoid wasting water, user charges for \nwater and sewerage services, and property tax reform for achieving the goals of the project. The \nfeedback  and  concerns  received  from  the  people  during  the  campaign  were  reviewed  by  the \nPMU, and were reflected in project implementation. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  general  covenants  related  to  project  implementation,  financial  audits,  statutory \ncompliances, and safeguards are being complied with. There were some minor delays (mostly \nrelated \ntargets.  For  example, \nimplementation of the financial improvement action plan (FIAP) has been slow due to delay in \nworks.  All  cities  have  agreed  to  the  water  tariff  increase,  but  some  cities  found  it  difficult  to \nincrease tariffs with the full understanding of the people without visible improvements in urban \ninfrastructure.  Fortunately,  Jabalpur  and  Indore  have  successfully  implemented  the  increase. \nDuring  the  midterm  review  wrap-up  meeting  in  Bhopal,  the  principal  secretary  of  the  UADD \nemphasized the importance of tariff increases, and urged the commissioner of each city to take \nimmediate action to successfully implement the FIAP. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  requirement  remained  unchanged  as  there  was  no  physical  change  within  the \noriginal scope and design. The social safeguard requirements therefore remain the same. The \nmidterm  review  confirmed  that  social  safeguards  addressed  under  the  project  were  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples  (1998),  and  the  National  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (amended  1984)  and  applicable \nstate  policies.  As  was  originally  envisaged,  the  land  acquisition  requirements  have  been \nminimized.  The  proposed  works  would  be  carried  out  on  available  government  land  free  of \nstructures  and  not  used  for  cultivation  or  grazing.  At  the  time  of  loan  appraisal,  a  short \nresettlement  plan 2   (SRP)  was  prepared  for  a  site  for  construction  of  an  integrated  sewage \ntreatment  plant  and  sanitary  landfill  in  Jabalpur.  The  SPR  was  updated  by  the  EA  in  August \n2007, and was reviewed and approved by ADB in September 2007. \n \n12. \nThe updated SRP set out the procedure for the acquisition of 78.3 hectares (ha) of land \nin Kathonda. Out of the 78.3 ha, 47.5 ha was vacant government land and the remaining 30.8 \nha  was  private  land.  A  total  of  17  titleholders  (99  persons)  and  eight  nontitled  families  (54 \npersons) were affected by either full or partial loss of property. The nongovernment organization \n(NGO) appointed for the implementation of the SRP will be responsible for conducting meetings \nand consultation with the nontitled affected families. All affected persons will be compensated in \naccordance  with  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the  approved  SRP.  The  EA  agreed  that  the  social \ndevelopment officer of the PIU will monitor the implementation of the SRP and provide regular \nreports to ADB as part of the quarterly progress reports. \n \n13. \nFor the ongoing works, there was no relocation of roadside kiosks during pipe laying in \nroad  corridors  and  other  works.

During  the  mission,  a  focused  refresher \nworkshop  on  social  safeguards  was  provided  to  the  project  managers,  social  and  community \ndevelopment officers of all PIUs and PMU staff, consultants, and NGOs. \n \nEnvironmental  Clearances.  The  mitigation  measures  proposed  in  the  original  initial \n14. \nenvironmental  examination  have  been  incorporated  into  the  design  and  initial  construction \nactivities. Bidding documents address environmental requirements and the design of packages \nhas  been  conducted  to  minimize  and/or  prevent  any  impacts.  Environmental  checklists  have \nbeen prepared to aid monitoring activities and extensive training has been provided in relation to \nmonitoring  of  potential  environmental  impacts  relating  to  construction  activities.  Requests  to \nobtain environmental clearances from the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board have been \ninitiated  in  most  instances.  The  EA  agreed  on  the  time-bound  action  plan  to  urgently  obtain \nnecessary clearances. \n \n15. \nEnvironmental  Management  and  Monitoring.  An  adequate  level  of  care  has  been \ntaken  in  implementing  required  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans.  The \nimprove \nmidterm  review  made \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring:  (i)  additional  resources  to  be  allocated  for \nenvironmental  monitoring  under  the  project,  such  as  (a)  an  additional  overall  planning  and \nmanagement expert under the project management consultancy, and (b) an environment expert \nas part of the design and supervision consultancy in each PIU; (ii) a groundwater quality testing \nprogram to be put in place to set baselines for all new and existing sewage treatment plants and \nsanitary landfill sites; (iii) sludge handling and disposal plants to be put in place for all cities with \nexisting and new water treatment plants and sewage treatment plants; and (iv) the PIUs and the \ncontractors to continue training on occupational health and safety and environmental monitoring \nchecklists. \n \n16. \nGender  Action  Plan.  The  gender  action  plan  has  been  updated  by  the  EA  and \ntranslated  into  the  local  language.  A  training  program  for  the  project  staff  and  the  municipal \ncorporations was scheduled to be conducted from June 2008. \n \nH. \n \n17. \nProject Accounts and Audit. Project accounts has been maintained both manually and \nusing  computerized  accounting  software  (named  Tally)  at  the  PMU  and  the  PIUs.  Accounting \nrecords  have  been  maintained  and  updated  regularly.  Bank  reconciliations  have  been  carried \nout  regularly  and  outstanding  items  have  been  regularly  followed  up.  A  project  accounting \nmanual  was  developed  and  has  been  adopted  by  the  PMU  and  the  PIUs.  The  municipal \ncorporations were subject to internal audit and pre-audit by the local fund auditor appointed by \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh. In addition, the project accounts were subject to audit by \nan independent auditor appointed by the UADD, and audit has been completed for the period up \nto 31 March 2007.

The  project  management  information \n18. \nsystem (PMIS) has been established, and the PMU is preparing a specification for modification. \nFurther  refinement  includes  contract  data  tracking,  in  which  contracts  were  classified  by  the \nnature  of  activities,  the  type  of  infrastructure,  and  input  requirements.  The  PMIS  User  Manual \nwould be revised in line with the expected refinements. The midterm review suggested that the \nPMIS  also  be  used  for  tracking  statutory  clearances  as  well  as  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCOST OVERRUN ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nSummary.  There  is  a  cost  overrun  of  $108  million  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. There are two major reasons for this: \n(i) appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, and (ii) price escalation of construction materials \nin  India.  The  appreciation  of  the  rupee  accounts  for  about  $77  million  (the  first  row  of  Table \nA3.1) of the overrun, and the price escalation for about $31 million (the fourth column of Table \nA3.1).

Project  costs  were  computed  in  rupees,  with  foreign \nexchange  costs  translated  into  rupees  at  the  projected  exchange  rate  for  the  year  of \nexpenditure.  Project  costs  were  prepared  in  nominal  terms,  taking  into  account  the  effects  of \ninflation  and  foreign  currency  fluctuations.  Purchasing  power  parity  was  the  base  assumption \nwith exchange rates expected to fluctuate, and is embedded in cost estimation software, Costab \n32, which has been distributed via the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website. The concept of \npurchasing  power  parity  implies  that,  when  domestic  inflation  is  higher  than  international \ninflation,  the  value  of  local  currency  is  reduced  in  the  following  year.  At  the  time  of  the  loan \nappraisal  of  the  project  in  2003,  international  inflation  was  estimated  at  2.4%  and  domestic \ninflation  was  estimated  at  5.0%.  It  was  forecast  that  the  rupee  would  depreciate  and  the \nexchange rate would become Rs49.9 per $1 on average during project implementation. \n \n\n      31.0 \n\n    77.0 \n\nn/c \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A3.2: ADB Financing Amount in Indian Rupees and US Dollars \n(million) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nItem \nOriginal total financing \nOriginal ADB financing \nOriginal GMP and municipal \ncorporations financing \n\n \n \n \n\nIndian Rupees \n13,700 \n9,000 \n\nUS Dollar \nAssumptions \nduring Loan \nAppraisal  \nin 2003 \n($1 = Rs49.9) \n275.0  \n181.0  \n\nUS Dollar \nAssumptions \nduring Loan \nAppraisal  \nin 2008 \n($1 = Rs39.0) \n352.0  \n231.6  \n\n \n \nUS Dollar \nFinancing Gap \ndue to \nExchange Rate\n77.0  \n50.6  \n\n4,700 \n\nn/c \n\nn/c \n\nn/c \n\nThe cost incurred in rupees  was financed by rupees.

Figure A3.1 on page 29 shows a large volume of \ncontracts  awarded  in  the  second  half  of  2007  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  The  progress \npayments  under  these  contracts  use  the  foreign  exchange  rate  of  the  date  of  payment,  and \nthese progress payments will continue until 2010. The value of $1 had substantially reduced to \naround Rs39 by November 2007. Consequently, in order to maintain the ADB financing amount \nof  Rs9  billion  to  pay  for  the  contracts,  the  loan  amount  requirement  in  dollar  terms  has \nincreased from $181 million to $232 million in 2008. In other words, there is a financing gap of \n$51 million (Table A3.2). \n \n4. \nPrice  Escalation  of  Construction  Materials.  The  project  cost  in  Indian  rupee  terms \nincreased by Rs1.2 billion (or by 8.8%) from Rs13.7 billion to Rs14.9 billion (Table A3.3). While \nsome  cost  items  were  reduced  due  to  revisions  of  the  input  requirements  during  detailed \nengineering design, the major cause of the project cost increase was the price escalation in civil \nworks, which increased by 11.0%. \n \n\nTable A3.3: Changes in Project Cost in Indian Rupee Terms \n(Rs million) \n\nRevised \nCost Estimates \n\nCost Items \nCivil Works \nEquipment \nConsulting Services \nProject Administration \nOthers \nTax and Duties \n \nTotal \n( ) = negative. \nNotes:  Contingencies were not able to cover the shortfall, as there was no financing source for contingencies due to \n\nRs Million \n900 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n(100) \n300 \n1,200 \n\n9,200  \n1,400  \n800  \n200  \n2,500  \n800  \n14,900  \n\nOriginal \nCost Estimates \n8,300  \n1,300  \n800  \n200  \n2,600  \n500  \n13,700  \n\n% \n11.0 \n7.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(4.0) \n60.0 \n8.8 \n\nChange \n\nrupee appreciation. \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n5. \nThe  price  of  a  civil  works  contract  comprises  labor,  construction  materials,  fuel,  and \ncontractor\u2019s profit. There was a gradual increase in the cost of construction materials between \n2003  and  2007.  In  an  urban  development  project,  civil  works  generally  requires  steel  for \nreinforced  concrete  and  large  pipes,  cement  for  construction  and  pipes,  plastic  for  pipes,  and \nfuel  for  operation  of  heavy  machinery  and  freight.  All  these  materials  experienced  price \nescalation, yet the extent of the increase varies from one material to another (Figure A3.2, page \n30). \n \n6. \nA large volume of contracts were awarded in the second half of 2007. These contracts \nreflected the materials\u2019 prices at that time. The cost of materials constitutes about 65\u201375% of a \ntypical civil works contract in the urban development sector. Based on an estimate of a typical \ncomposition  of  the  material  required  in  works,  the  weighted  average  increase  in  construction \nmaterial  cost  between  2003  and  2007  is  estimated  at  39\u201348%  (Table  A3.4).  The  labor  cost, \nwhich  generally  constitutes  10\u201320%  of  contract  values,  also  increased  about  22%  between \n2003 and 2007. Overall, there was escalation of contract prices of about 29\u201331% between the \noriginal estimates and the contract award prices. Nevertheless, the extent of increase varies in \nrelation  to  the  nature  of  works.  For  example,  works  requiring  heavy  use  of  steel  and  cement \nmight  have  increased  the  contract  price  by  as  much  as  45%,  whereas  waterworks  laying \npolyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  pipes  might  have  experienced  a  moderate  increase  of  around  30% \nbetween 2003 and 2007. \n\n \n\n\f 28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nPrice Index Item \nWater Supply \nSteel \nCement \nPlastic Products \nFuel \n\nSewerage \nSteel \nCement \nPlastic Products \nFuel \n\nWeighted Average \n\nTable A3.4: Price Indexa of Major Construction Materials in 2003 and 2007 \n\n Average \nin 2003 \n \n\nAverage \nin 2007 \n \n\nPercentage \nChange \n \n\nWeight \n(%) \n\nAverage \n(%) \n\n \n\n176 \n146 \n132 \n270 \n \n \n176 \n146 \n132 \n270 \n\n268 \n212 \n152 \n382 \n \n \n268 \n212 \n152 \n382 \n\n52.4 \n45.0 \n15.2 \n41.7 \n \n \n52.4 \n45.0 \n15.2 \n41.7 \n\n27 \n40 \n27 \n7 \n100 \n \n38 \n54 \n0 \n8 \n  100 \n\n14.0 \n18.0 \n4.0 \n2.8 \n38.8 \n \n20.1 \n24.2 \n0.0 \n3.2 \n47.6 \n\nWeighted Average \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naBase year 1993\u20131994 = 100 \nSources: Reserve Bank of India and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n7. \nDespite the price escalation rates of around 29\u201331%, the impact on the civil works cost \nwas limited to an increase of about 11%. Minimization of the impacts of the price escalation was \nachieved  by  shifting  some  contracts  from  ADB  financing  to  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  special \ngrant programs and municipal corporations\u2019 own financing schemes. This reduced the total cost \nof  civil  works  contracts  for  ADB  financing.  For  example,  the  municipal  corporations,  in \nassociation  with  the  project  management  unit,  establish  three  financial  sources  for  about  10 \ncontracts: \n \n(i) \n\nGovernment grants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n(JNNURM)  to  finance  a  large  portion  of  works  for  the  sewerage  networks  in \nIndore, \nGovernment  grants  under  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for \nSmall and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) to finance a large portion of works for the \nsewerage network and the sewage treatment plant in Gwalior, and \nthe  municipal  corporations\u2019  own  budgets  to  finance  some  contracts  for  water \nsupply  optimization  in  Gwalior  and  a  large  portion  of  works  related  to  sanitary \nlandfill development in Bhopal.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fFigure A3.1: Exchange \nFigure A3.1: Exchange \n\nFigure A3.1: Exchange Rates and Cumulative Contract Award Amount  \nFigure A3.1: Exchange Rates and Cumulative Contract Award Amount  \n\n \n\n \n\ni\n\n \n1\n$\n \nr\ne\np\n \ne\ne\np\nu\nr\n \nn\na\nd\nn\nI\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\na\nR\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\nE\n\n50.0\n\n45.0\n\n40.0\n\n35.0\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\n\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\n\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\n\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\n\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\n\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n \nSources: Reserve Bank of India and Yahoo Finance. \n \n\n Contract awards source data is in the attachment to this appendix. \n\nMonthly average\n\nCumulative Contract Awards\n\n \n\n180.0\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n \n$\n \n:\ns\nd\nr\na\nw\nA\n\n \nt\nc\na\nr\nt\nn\no\nC\n \ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n160.0\n\n140.0\n\n120.0\n\n100.0\n\n80.0\n\n60.0\n\n40.0\n\n20.0\n\n0.0\n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nn\nd\nd\nx\nx\n \n \n\ni\ni\n\n3\n3\n\n \n \n\n2\n2\n9\n9\n \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A3.2: Price Indexes and Cumulative Contract Award Amount \n \n\n \n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n)\n0\n0\n1\n \n=\n \n4\n9\n/\n3\n9\n9\n1\n(\n \nx\ne\nd\nn\nI\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\n\nP\n\ne\nt\na\nD\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\nn\na\nJ\n\nb\ne\nF\n\nr\na\nM\n\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\ny\na\nM\n\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\nl\n\ny\nu\nJ\n\ng\nu\nA\n\nt\np\ne\nS\n\nt\nc\nO\n\nv\no\nN\n\nc\ne\nD\n\n2003-04\n\n2004-05\n\n2005-06\n\n2006-07\n\n2007-08\n\nPrice Index of Steel\n\nPrice Index of Cement\n\nPrice Index of Plastic Products\n\nPrice Index of Fuel (Mineral Oils)\n\nWeighted Average of Steel, Cement, Plastic, and Fuel\n\nCumulative Contract Awards\n\n \nSources: Reserve Bank of India. \n \n\n Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n200\n\n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n \nn\ni\n \n$\n(\n \ns\nd\nr\na\nw\nA\n\n \nt\nc\na\nr\nt\nn\no\nC\n \ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n\fCONTRACT VALUE VARIATION ANALYSIS \n \n\nActivities \n\nBid Prices/Revised Contract Values \n(Rs million) \n\nAnalysis of \nCost Variation \n\nScope \n\nBhopal \n24-hour water \nsupply to 12 \nwards of Bhopal \n\n \nWater Supply Optimization \n\u2022  Leak detection and rectification \n\u2022  Supply and installation of bulk water meters \n\u2022  Renovation of the seven existing water \n\n \n\ntreatment plants. \n\nOriginal estimates: Rs89 million \n\nWater Supply Optimization \n\nContract \nPackages \nBPL/WS/01 \nBPL/WS/02 \nBPL/WS/03 \nBPL/WS/05 \nBPL/WS/12 \nTotal \n\nFinancing \nSources \nOriginal Loan \nOriginal Loan \nOriginal Loan \nOriginal Loan \nSup.

A  financial  analysis  of  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental \nImprovement  in  Madhya  Pradesh  Project  was  carried  out  for  the  revenue-generating \nsubprojects  to  confirm  financial  sustainability  during  the  loan  appraisal,  and  reported  in  the \nreport and recommendation of the President in 2003.1 The project aimed to improve generation \nof  revenues  from  own  sources,  and  to  ensure  that  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nboth  existing  and  new  assets  could  be  adequately  covered.  The  original  financial  analysis \nassumed  timely  construction  of  urban  infrastructure,  and  implementation  of  the  financial \nimprovement  action  plan  (FIAP),  which  was  designed  mainly  to  increase  (i)  a  property  tax,  (ii) \nwater  charges,  (iii)  sewerage  surcharges,  (iv)  solid-waste  management  fees,  and  (v)  property \ntax. \n \n2. \nThis  revisited  financial  analysis  will  not  propose  any  revisions  in  tariff  and  property  tax \nrates  from  the  original  financial  analysis  in  2003. 2   Instead,  it  proposes  to  reschedule \nimplementation of the FIAP to reflect the delay in construction of urban infrastructure. Therefore, \nthe  result  of  the  original  financial  analysis  remains  the  same,  except  for  the  financial  cost\u2013\nbenefit  analysis.  This  revisited  financial  analysis  focuses  on  FIAP  rescheduling  and  financial \ncost\u2013benefit analysis. \n \nProgress of the Financial Improvement Action Plan. The FIAP was formulated with a \n3. \nphilosophy  that  people  would  not  accept  any  tariff  increase  unless  there  were  visible \nimprovements in urban services. It was envisaged that the start of major tariff increases would \nstart  from  the  second  year  of  project  implementation,  when  some  new  urban  infrastructure \nbecame operational. In reality, however, it was only in the second half of 2007 that the majority \nof  contract  works  were  awarded  to  the  contractor.  Although  there  has  been  good  progress  in \nimplementation  of  works,  major  infrastructure  is  still  under  construction  and  will  become \noperational  during  2009\u20132010.  Consequently,  the  start  of  FIAP  implementation  was  also \ndelayed, at least by 3 years. \n \n4. \nIndore  increased  water  tariffs  in  line  with  the  FIAP  in  2006.  Jabalpur  also  increased \nwater tariff in 2006, but the extent of the increase was less than the FIAP. Ironically, however, \ntariff  collection  efficiency  substantially  dropped  in  both  towns  (from  40%  to  9%  in  Indore,  and \nfrom 46% to 41% in Jabalpur). There have been no major water tariff increases in Bhopal and \nGwalior, but tariff collection efficiency went up in Gwalior (from 25% to 61%). The introduction of \nsewerage  surcharges  and  solid-waste  management  fees  are  still  pending,  as  are  revisions  in \nthe  property  tax  rates  and  assets  valuation.  The  current  FIAP  implementation  status  implies \npolitical  unwillingness  to  charge,  and  consumers\u2019  unwillingness  to  pay,  until  there  are  visible \nimprovements in urban services. \n \nRescheduling the Financial Improvement Action Plan. The implementation schedule \n5. \nof  the  FIAP  was  rescheduled  to synchronize  with  the  progress  of  physical  investment  and  the \nreform agenda under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), in order to \nimplement the FIAP with the full understanding of the people of the municipal corporations. The \nrescheduled  FIAP  is  presented  in  Table  A8.4.  In  2008  and  2009,  while  there  will  be  no  major \n                                                 \n1 \nADB. 2003.

Manila (Appendixes \n12 and 13). \n2 \nThe  target  tariff  and  property  tax  rates  in  the  original  FIAP  were  found  to  be  adequate  despite  the  project \ncost increase. This was because there was some reduction in operation and maintenance (O&M) costs through the \nmunicipal corporations\u2019 effort in minimizing the energy costs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ntariff  increases,  the  tariff  collection  efficiency  levels  will  be  brought  back  to  the  2005  level  in \nIndore  and  Jabalpur.  From  2010,  while  reducing  the  nonrevenue  water  and  unaccounted-for \nwater, there will be substantial increases in collection efficiency and recovery of operation and \nmaintenance costs. Such increase will be made possible as (i) there will be visible improvement \nin urban services, and (ii) each municipal corporation will operate a new revenue management \nsystem, being developed under the Government of the United Kingdom\u2019s bilateral assistance.3 \nWhile  the  final  target  will  be  delayed  by  1  year,  there  is  no  change  in  the  final  targets  for  the \nuser  charges  of  various  services  from  the  original  FIAP.  The  rescheduled  FIAP  represents \naverage  values  and  increase  in  rates.  This  will  be  translated  into  actual  tariff  table  by \nrestructuring tariffs as volumetric tariffs and incorporating equity consideration, such as lifeline \ntariffs. \n \n\nTable A8.1: Changes in Subproject Cost \n(Rs million) \n\n \nItem \nBhopal \n\nOriginal \nEstimatesa\n\nBid Prices and \nRevised Estimatesa\n\nVariation \n\nVariation \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n678.8 \n501.8 \n124.5 \n \n767.5 \n739.6 \n77.8 \n\n \n\n \n40.6 \n321.7 \n(87.3) \n\nGwalior \n\nIndore \n\n \n \n \n\n6 \n64 \n(70) \n\nWater Supply \nSewerage and Sanitationb\nSolid Waste Managementb\n\nWater Supply  \nSewerage, Drainage, and Sanitationb\nSolid Waste Managementb\n\n719.4 \n823.5 \n37.2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigures  include  contingencies  and  tax.

For  the  cost  benefit  analysis,  however,  the  investment  costs  of  the  urban  infrastructure  fully \nfinanced by municipal corporations were incorporated. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the project management unit data. \n \n6. \nChange in the Project Cost. The project cost in Indian rupee terms increased by Rs1.2 \nbillion  (or  by  8.8%)  from  Rs14  billion  to  Rs15  billion.  The  major  cause  of  the  increase  in  the \nproject cost was price escalation in civil works (11.5%). In an urban sector project, civil works \ngenerally  require  steel  (for  reinforced  concrete  and  large  pipes),  cement  (for  construction  and \npipes), plastic products (for pipes), and fuel (for operation of heavy machinery and freight). All \nmaterials  experienced  price  escalation,  yet  the  extent  of  increase  varies  from  one  material  to \n                                                 \n3  Madhya Pradesh Urban Service for the Poor (MPUSP) is funded through a \u00a341 million grant from the Government \nof the United Kingdom for 5 years from 2006 to 2011. The ultimate objective of the MPUSP is increasing the urban \nlocal bodies\u2019 (ULB) capacity to deliver better services for the poor, through (i) setting up a participatory procedure \nfor improving slum communities, (ii) increasing the engineering capacity of the ULBs to design and implement slum \nimprovement  activities,  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  ULBs'  financial  capacity  to  invest  more  into  slum  improvement \nactivities  and  maintain  urban  services  by  enhancing  the  revenue  through  accounting  reforms.  The  accounting \nreform  will  develop  an  accounting  system  which  contains  a  revenue  module  linked  with  household  data  and  a \ngeographic information system. This will help increase collection efficiency of user charges and taxes. \n\na \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n49\n\nanother.  While  the  change  in  the  overall  works  cost  was  about  11.5%,  some  contract  works \nexperienced  bigger  price  changes  than  others,  as  each  work  contract  has  different  material \nrequirements.  As  such,  the  impact  of  price  escalation  varies  from  one  contract  to  another. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  price  escalation.  Table  A8.1 \nsummarizes the changes in subproject costs. \n \n7. \nFinancial  Cost\u2013Benefit  Analysis.  This financial analysis reassessed the sustainability \nof  all  revenue-generating  subprojects,  based  on  the  revised  cost  estimates  and  the  contract \nprices,  and  rescheduled  FIAP  in  accordance  with  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects, ADB 2005.4 Financial analysis was conducted on a with-projects and without-projects \nbasis by estimating incremental costs and revenues over a 25-year period. The life of the newly \ncreated  water  infrastructure  is  40  years.  The  base  case  compared  the  estimated  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  relevant  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  to \ndetermine the financial viability of the revenue-generating subprojects. \n \n8. \nWeighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  The  WACC  calculation  reflects  the  fund  flow \narrangement  between  the  Government  of  India  and  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh.  The \nnominal cost of the grant is considered to be 8.5% based on the Government\u2019s long-term bond \nrate. The nominal cost of the government of Madhya Pradesh and municipal corporations\u2019 own \nfinancing portion is, on the other hand, estimated at 10%, taking the value from the economic \nopportunity cost of capital (EOCC).5 As shown in Table A8.2, the WACC is estimated at 3.83%. \n \n\nTable A8.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n\n \n\n \n\nInitial Loan \n\nGovernment \nof India \nOnlending \n126.70 \n33.08 \n10.50 \n0.00 \n\n \n \n \nItem \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting (%) \nNominal Cost (%) \nTax Rate (%) \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost \n(%) \n \n \n \n \nInflation Rate (%) \n \n \nReal Cost (%) \nWeighted Component (%) \n \n \nMC = municipal corporation, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na \n\nGovernment \nof Indiaa\nGrant \n54.30 \n14.18 \n8.50 \n0.00 \n\n10.50 \n5.00 \n5.24 \n1.73 \n\n8.50 \n5.00 \n3.33 \n0.47 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nSup.

All  analyses  are  conducted  in  real  terms  at  2008 \ndomestic  prices.  Cost  and  revenue  projections  are  made  over  a  25-year  period,  and  salvage \nvalue is considered at the end of the period. The cost includes (i) capital expenditures under the \nproject  including  physical  contingencies,  tax,  and  duties;  and  (ii)  O&M  expenditures.  The \nrevenue projection includes tariff and connection fees from new customers for water supply and \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila \n5  As suggested in ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, grant funds provided to the project also \nhave an opportunity cost. As such, it is proposed that grants be treated in a similar fashion to equity and the cost of \ngrant be assumed to be the cost of equity. The cost of equity is assumed to be equal to the Government\u2019s economic \ncost of capital. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nsewerage  as  projected  in  the  rescheduled  indicative  FIAP.  Table  A8.3  shows  the  summary \nresults of the financial analysis. \n \n10. \nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  in  the  base  case  are  estimated  at  3.0%\u2013\n12.9%  for  water  supply  subprojects,  at  3.1%\u20134.7%  for  the  sewerage  subproject,  and  6.4%\u2013\n18.5%  for  solid-waste  management  subprojects.  The  FIRRs  are  lower  than  the  WACC  for  the \nwater  supply  subproject  in  Indore  and  sewerage  subprojects  in  Bhopal  and  Indore.  These \nsubprojects had comparatively lower FIRRs in the original financial analysis.  \n \n11. \nThe  low  FIRR  for  the  water  supply  subproject  in  Indore  is  due  to  the  higher  cost  of \ninvestment  and  operation  associated  with  its  hilly  geography  around  the  water  source.  The \noriginal  design  of  the  subproject  was,  however,  the  only  least-cost  option  to  supply  water  to \nIndore, and there were enormous social and political risks with the \"do-nothing option\". As such, \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh has provided the Indore municipal corporations with grants \nto  offset  a  portion  of  the  cost  of  investment.  This  reduced  the  WACC  to  approximately  3.1%. \nThe FIRR of the water supply subproject in Indore (3.5%) compares favorably with the revised \nWACC. Despite the low level of the FIRR, however, the water supply subproject in Indore will \ngenerate adequate revenue to sustain O&M. \n \n12. \nFor the sewerage subprojects in Bhopal and Indore with the low FIRR (3.4% in Bhopal \nand 3.5% in Indore), on the other hand, the revenue from the proposed tariffs are not sufficient \nto  recover  both  capital  and  O&M  cost,  because  (i)  the  investment  cost  is  high  due  to  deeper \nexcavation  than  water  supply  works,  and  (ii)  there  is  a  social  and  political  inhibition  to  set \nsewerage  tariffs  higher  than  water  supply  tariffs.  Combined  FIRRs  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage are, however, all above the WACC. Despite the low level of the FIRR, the sewerage \nsubprojects in Bhopal and Indore will generate adequate revenue to sustain O&M. \n \n13. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the financial sustainability \nto changes in project parameters. The results indicate that the financial internal rates of return in \nall  sectors  are  most  sensitive  to  reduction  in  the  incremental  revenue.  This  suggests  that,  in \norder  to  realize  higher  financial  returns,  (i)  the  planned  coverage  of  services  needs  to  be \nachieved, and (ii) the rescheduled indicative FIAP needs to be implemented on time. \n\n \nTable A8.3: Revised Financial Internal Rate of Return \nBhopal \n\nGwalior \n\nIndorea\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n9.9 \n1,559.5 \n\n12.9 \n1,191.3 \n\n3.5 \n288.4 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n9.6 \n296.0 \n\n9.6 \n308.0 \n\n8.6 \n75.0 \n\n8.5 \n\n3.4 \n(35.9) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2.8 \n51.0 \n\n2.4 \n31.0 \n\n1.8 \n20.0 \n\n2.3 \n\n3.5 \n33.8 \n\n11.8 \n115.0 \n\n12.7 \n593.0 \n\n11.5 \n93.0 \n\n11.2 \n\n3.8 \n(4.4) \n\nJabalpur \n \n \n8.8 \n1,119.8 \n \n7.9 \n96.0 \n \n8.5 \n286.0 \n \n7.5 \n71.0 \n \n7.6 \n \n \n4.7 \n88.7 \n\nItem \nWater Supply \nBase case \n\nFIRR (%) \nNPV (Rs million) \n\nCapital cost increase by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nO&M costs increased by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n1-year delay in service \n\nFIRR (%) \n\nSewerage \n\nBase case \n\nFIRR (%) \nNPV (Rs million) \n\n \n\nIncremental revenue decreased by 10% \n\n\fIncremental revenue decreased by 10% \n\n \n\nItem \n\nCapital cost increase by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nO&M costs increased by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n1-year delay in service \n\nFIRR (%) \n\nWater Supply and Sewerage \n\nBase case \n\nFIRR (%) \nNPV (Rs million) \n\nCapital cost increase by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nO&M costs increased by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n1- year delay in service \n\nFIRR (%) \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\nBase case \n\nFIRR (%) \nNPV (Rs million) \n\nIncremental revenue decreased by 10% \n\nCapital cost increase by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nO&M costs increased by 10% \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n\nFIRR (%) \nSwitching value (%) \n1- year delay in service \n\nIncremental revenue decreased by 10% \n\nBhopal \n\nGwalior \n\nIndorea\n\nAppendix 8 \n\n51\n\n \n\n2.8 \n54.0 \n\n3.1 \n94.0 \n\n2.5 \n38.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n8.5 \n1,648.5 \n\n8.0 \n182.0 \n\n8.1 \n252.0 \n\n7.3 \n70.0 \n\n7.3 \n\n6.4 \n26.9 \n\n4.5 \n33.0 \n\n4.5 \n34.0 \n\n2.0 \n15.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9.6 \n1,173.1 \n\n3.5 \n322.1 \n\n3.1 \n56.0 \n\n3.3 \n80.0 \n\n2.7 \n36.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n8.6 \n103.0 \n\n9.3 \n313.0 \n\n8.3 \n75.0 \n\n8.3 \n\n7.7 \n35.0 \n\n6.2 \n53.0 \n\n6.3 \n55.0 \n\n4.8 \n27.0 \n\n2.9 \n56.0 \n\n3.1 \n77.0 \n\n2.6 \n36.0 \n\n2.8 \n\n2.8 \n51.0 \n\n2.5 \n33.0 \n\n1.9 \n21.0 \n\n2.4 \n\n18.5 \n266.3 \n\n16.7 \n105.0 \n\n17.3 \n148.0 \n\n15.3 \n5.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nJabalpur \n \n4.0 \n67.0 \n \n4.6 \n323.0 \n \n3.9 \n61.0 \n \n4.1 \n \n \n8.8 \n1,119.8 \n \n7.9 \n96.0 \n \n8.5 \n286.0 \n \n7.5 \n71.0 \n \n7.6 \n \n \n8.7 \n33.5 \n \n7.1 \n53.0 \n \n\n6.8 \n46.0 \n\n4.7 \n22.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFIRR (%) \n\n3.6 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, NRW = nonrevenue water, O&M = operation and \nmaintenance. \na \n\nThe government of Madhya Pradesh has provided the Indore municipal corporations with grants to offset a \n\n14.2 \n\n5.5 \n\n5.7 \n\nportion of the cost of investment.

An  economic  analysis  of  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental \nImprovement  in  Madhya  Pradesh  Project  was  carried  out  to  confirm  economic  viability  during \nthe  loan  appraisal,  and  reported  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  in  2003.1 \nThe proposed supplementary loan is to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation and \nprice escalation, and there is no variation in the project scope and the benefit levels. Therefore, \nthe  result  of  the  original  economic  analysis  remains  the  same,  except  for  the  economic  cost\u2013\nbenefit  analysis.  This  revisited  economic  analysis  focuses  on  economic  cost\u2013benefit  analysis, \nusing the same approach as was used in the original economic analysis. \n \n2. \nChange in the Project Cost. The project cost in Indian rupee terms increased by Rs1.2 \nbillion  (or  by  8.8%)  from  Rs14  billion  to  Rs15  billion.  The  major  cause  of  the  increase  in  the \nproject cost was price escalation in civil works (11.5%). In an urban sector project, civil works \ngenerally  require  steel  (for  reinforced  concrete  and  large  pipes),  cement  (for  construction  and \npipes), plastic products (for pipes), and fuel (for operation of heavy machinery and freight). All \nmaterials  experienced  price  escalation,  yet  the  extent  of  increase  varies  from  one  material  to \nanother.  While  the  change  in  the  overall  works  cost  was  about  11.5%,  some  contract  works \nexperienced  bigger  price  changes  than  others.  Each  work  contract  has  different  material \nrequirements.  As  such,  the  impact  of  price  escalation  varies  from  one  contract  to  another. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  price  escalation.  Table  A9.1 \nsummarizes the changes in subproject costs. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Changes in Subproject Cost \n(Rs million) \n\nOriginal \nEstimatesa\n\nBid Prices and \nRevised Estimatesa\n\nVariation \n\n \n\n \nItem \nBhopal \n\nWater Supply \nSewerage and Sanitationb\nSolid-Waste Managementb\n\nGwalior \n\nWater Supply  \nSewerage, Drainage, and Sanitationb\nSolid-Waste Managementb\n\nIndore \n\nWater Supply \nSewerage and Sanitationb\nSolid-Waste Management \n\nJabalpur \n\nWater Supply \nSewerage, Drainage, and Sanitation \nSolid-Waste Management \n\n( ) = negative. \na \n\n \n\n678.8 \n501.8 \n124.5 \n\n767.5 \n739.6 \n77.8 \n \n\n4,357.0 \n668.3 \n139.1 \n\n932.0 \n933.6 \n88.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n719.4 \n823.5 \n37.2 \n\n995.6 \n325.3 \n1.9 \n\n6,075.0 \n105.3 \n153.1 \n\n1,868.3 \n843.9 \n88.1 \n\nVariation \n(%) \n \n6 \n64 \n(70) \n \n30 \n(56) \n(97) \n \n39 \n(84) \n10 \n \n100 \n(10) \n0 \n\n \n40.6 \n321.7 \n(87.3) \n \n228.1 \n(414.3) \n(75.9) \n \n1,718.0 \n(563.0) \n14.0 \n \n936.3 \n(89.7) \n(0.2) \n\nFigures  include  contingencies  and  tax.

Manila (Appendix 11). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n3. \nEconomic Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis. In order to assess the economic efficiency of project \ninvestments, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) in 25 years has been estimated. The \nshadow  exchange  rate  factor 2   was  updated,  but  shadow  wage  rate 3   used  in  the  original \neconomic analysis was applied. \n \nEconomic Costs. There are two types of costs: (i) capital investment,4 and (ii) operation \n4. \nand maintenance. The economic cost of the investment is converted from the financial cost. The \noperation and maintenance cost includes updated energy cost, chemicals, salaries, and repair \nand maintenance. \n \n5. \nEconomic Benefits. Economic benefit of water supply subprojects consist of (i) savings \naccrued by replacing existing water sources with piped household connections,5 and (ii) value of \nwater  which  consumers  are  willing  to  pay6  for  additional  consumption  as  a  result  of  greater \navailability  of  water.  The  benefits  of  improved  sewerage  and  sanitation  are  primarily  public \nhealth and environmental improvement. As these benefits are reflected in the willingness to pay, \nthe economic benefit of sewerage and sanitation subprojects are valued using the willingness to \npay of residential households and businesses.7 Similarly, the economic benefits of solid waste \nmanagement projects were estimated using the willingness to pay of residential households and \nbusinesses.8 The willing to pay figures used in the revised analysis are the same as those in the \noriginal economic analysis in 2003 due to lack of updated data, and therefore the analysis is a \nconservative estimate. \n \n6. \nEconomic  Opportunity  Cost  of  Capital.  Given  the  complexity  of  estimating  country-\nspecific  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  a  discount  rate  of  12%  in  constant \neconomic  prices  is  generally  used  as  a  proxy  for  EOCC  in  the  economic  analysis  of  ADB-\nfinanced  projects.9  The benefit  is  measured  by willingness  to  pay  in  the  original  analysis.  The \nlevel of benefit is most likely underestimated, because the respondents of the willingness to pay \nsurvey might not aware of the all kinds of potential benefit, and therefore were not able to reflect \nthe value of all benefits but only the perceived immediate benefit. As significant unquantifiable \nnet benefits are believed to be likely, all EIRRs are likely to be substantially underestimated. In \n\n                                                 \n2  The standard conversion factor used was 0.85, which was equal to the shadow exchange rate factor of 1.17. No \nbackground information was provided in the original economic analysis  worksheets. The revised shadow exchange \nrate factor using the external trade data was 1.06. \n3  The shadow wage rates were 0.75 for skilled labor and 0.98 for unskilled labor. No background information was \nprovided in the original economic analysis worksheets. \n4  For large urban infrastructure, 40 years of life was assumed and the residual values were taken into consideration \nin the 25th  year. For equipment and landfill sites, 10  years of life is assumed, and the same amount of the cost is \nincurred every 10 years during the analysis period. \n5  The  resource  cost  saving  was  estimated  at  Rs22.6  per  cubic  meter  in  the  original  economic  analysis  in  2003 \nbased on the findings from the project preparatory technical assistance. \n6  Willingness to pay was estimated through a survey during the project preparatory technical assistance. According \nto  the  original  economic  analysis,  the  value  was  underestimated  by  the  respondents  of  the  survey,  since  the \nincremental benefit of providing enough water to avoid a water crisis and ensure economic survival was much higher \nthan was reflected by the simple willingness to pay revealed by individual households. \n7  The willingness to pay of a residential household is Rs76 per month in Bhopal, Rs61 in Gwalior, Rs69 in Indore, \nand Rs61 Jabalpur; the willingness to pay of a business is Rs238 per month in Bhopal, Rs126 in Gwalior, Rs273 in \nIndore, and Rs85 in Jabalpur.  \n8  The willingness to pay of a residential household is Rs16 per month in Bhopal, Rs11 in Gwalior, Rs17 in Indore, \nand Rs13 in Jabalpur; and the willingness to pay of a business is Rs71 per month in Bhopal, Rs31 in Gwalior, Rs42 \nin Indore, and Rs52 in Jabalpur. \n9   ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n55\n\ncase of the water supply subproject in Indore (EIRR of 10%),10 not only will there be substantial \nunderestimation  of  the  EIRR,  but  also,  a  \"do-nothing  option\"  will  cause  increasing  economic \ncost of water supply shortage.11 Considering the enormous social and political risks of the do-\nnothing  option  in  Indore,  and  lack  of  alternative  approaches  to  the  problems,  there  are  few \nequivalent potential investment activities for the given capital. \n \n7. \nConclusion.  As  Table  A9.2  shows,  all  subprojects  are  economically  viable,  in  spite  of \nthe cost increase, with the estimated EIRR values exceeding the EOCC in all cases. The EIRR \nof most of the subprojects are lower than the original estimates. However, some subprojects are \nhigher  than  in  the  original  economic  analysis  because  the  detail  engineering  design\u2019s  cost \nestimates of some subprojects became less than the feasibility study estimates as the result of \nefforts of the municipal corporations, and the operation and maintenance cost became less than \nwhat was originally envisaged. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the \neconomic  results  to  changes  in  project  parameters.  The  results  indicate  that  the  EIRRs  are \nsensitive  to  a  1-year  delay  in  realization  of  the  economic  benefits  in  some  subprojects  and \nreduction in beneficiary levels in other subprojects. This suggests that, in order to realize higher \neconomic benefits, (i) timely completion of works and smooth transition to operation are crucial, \nand (ii) the planned coverage of services needs to be achieved. \n\n                                                 \n10   ADB.  2002.
