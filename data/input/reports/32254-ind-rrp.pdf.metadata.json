Despite the initial slow start-up, the project is \nprogressing well. In 2007 alone, contracts worth $156 million were \nawarded out of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan proceeds \nof $181 million. The cumulative contract awards reached $173 \nmillion,  with  a  loan  balance  of  $8  million  for  further  contract \nawards. There is, however, about $82 million worth of contracts \nthat remain to be awarded. In other words, the project faces a cost \noverrun. \n \nThe reason for the cost overrun is an increase in the original cost \nestimates, caused mainly by (i) rupee appreciation, and (ii) price \nincreases between the initial loan appraisal in 2003 and 2007. The \nrecent steep appreciation of the rupee resulted in the reduction of \nthe initial loan amount in rupee terms by approximately Rs2.0 \nbillion  ($50.6  million  equivalent).  The  high  demand  for \nconstruction  materials  in  the  booming  Indian  economy  and  a \nworldwide increase in oil prices have led to large cost increases \nfor construction materials\u2014the price index of steel increased by \n12% per year on average, cement increased by 10%, and fuel \nincreased by 9%. The impact of the price escalation on the total \nproject  cost  was  estimated  at  Rs1.2  billion  ($31  million \nequivalent), or 9%. \n   \n  Without  additional  financing,  the  project  in  its  original  scope \ncannot  be  completed,  and  the  system  integrity  of  the  urban \ninfrastructure for water supply, sewerage, and waste disposal will \nbe  severely  undermined.  Consequently,  not  only  will  there  be \nabout a 35% reduction in the number of potential beneficiaries of \nthe  project,  but  the  beneficiaries  will  also  be  connected  to \nincomplete systems of urban infrastructure. Being a high priority \nproject, these pending works will eventually have to be carried out \nby  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  municipal \ncorporations. However, due to the limited availability of long-term \nfinancial  resources,  it  is  uncertain  when  the  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations can secure the \nfull amount to complete the original project scope. The economic ", "ii \n \nand financial analyses of the initial loan indicate that the extent of \nreduction in the internal rate of returns is greater for a 1-year \ndelay in benefit than for a 10% capital cost increase. In other \nwords, there is a clear indication that completion of the full scope \nof the project is more financially sustainable and economically \nviable than leaving the project incomplete for an unknown period. \n   \n  There are about 30 contracts under the proposed supplementary \nfinancing. Out of the 30 contracts, nine are ready to be awarded, \nand are expecting to receive ADB retroactive financing. Detailed \nengineering design will be completed for eight contracts before \nSeptember 2008 and for all remaining contracts before January \n2009. \n   \nRevised Investment Plan  Revised costs for the project, including those to be financed under \nthe proposed supplementary loan, are estimated at $383 million \nincluding taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, and \nfinancing  charges  during  implementation.  The  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  from  ADB  financing  is  $71  million,  which \nconsists of $50.6 million for recuperating from the impact of rupee \nappreciation and $20.4 million for meeting the price escalation.  \n   \nRevised Financing Plan  Under the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will \ncover 65.8% of the total investment costs. Of the total investment \ncost,  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  municipal \ncorporations will finance 34.1%, and the United Nations Human \nSettlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) will finance 0.1% through \nparallel grant cofinancing. The Government of India will pass the \nproposed supplementary loan on to the government of Madhya \nPradesh on the same terms as the ADB loan. The government of \nMadhya  Pradesh  will  then  onlend  the  loan  to  the  municipal \ncorporations on similar terms and conditions as that for the initial \nloan to be synchronous with the initial loan repayment period.  \n   \nSupplementary Loan  A loan of $71 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources will be \nAmount and Terms  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The repayments of the supplementary loan \nwill  be  fully  synchronized  with  that  of  the  initial  loan. \nConsequently, the loan will have a term of 20 years, no grace \nperiod,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 September 2011 \n   \nImplementation  Implementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  supplementary \nArrangements  loan will remain the same as for the initial project loan, except for \n  (i) the use of advance contracting and retroactive financing, (ii) a \nrevised implementation period, and (iii) continuous engagement of \nconsultants.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to India for the Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in \nMadhya Pradesh Project.1  \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  The state of Madhya Pradesh (which translates to \"central province\") is located in the \ngeographic heart of India. It was created in 1956 by merging three states,2 and until 2000 was \nthe largest state in India.3 Its capital is Bhopal. Madhya Pradesh inherited its poor economic, \nsocial and physical infrastructure from the original three states.  \n \n3.  About 50% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in India is generated in urban areas, \nwhere 28% of the population lives. The estimated per capita productivity ratio between the \nurban and rural populations is 7:3. This suggests that economic growth is dependent on urban \nareas  and  their  ability  to  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity.  The  major  cities  of \nMadhya Pradesh have great potential for economic growth. Not only are they the centers for \ntrading and commercial activities of the districts, but they are also becoming tourist hubs due to \nthree World Heritage sites4 and several cities considered extraordinary for their architectural \nand scenic beauty. However, poor urban infrastructure and services are major constraints to the \nexpansion of trade, commerce, and tourism, leading to economic inefficiency. \n \n4.  When the initial assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was proposed in 2003 \nin the largest cities of Madhya Pradesh\u2014Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur\u2014water supply \ndid not meet standard requirements, as it was being supplied for only a few hours a day in the \nwet  season  and  less  than  an  hour  every  other  day  in  the  dry  season.  Without  urgent \ninterventions, the average water supply would have been less than 40 liters per capita per day \n(lpcd) by 2010, which was well below the minimum standard of 70 lpcd set by the Government \nof India. In addition, in Bhopal, Gwalior, and Indore, the existing sewerage systems covered less \nthan 10% of the population, resulting in unhygienic living conditions and public health problems. \nInadequate  solid-waste  management  was  evident  in  the  largest  cities;  streets,  drainage \nchannels, and open areas were littered with waste. Residents and businesses felt the situation \nwas intolerable as it affected public health and tourist perceptions of the cities. \n \n5.  To mitigate the deteriorating urban infrastructure and services in the largest cities, the \nUrban Administration and Development Department of the government of Madhya Pradesh, \ndeveloped  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental  Improvement  in  Madhya  Pradesh \nProject in 2003 with the help of ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). ADB\u2019s \nloan  appraisal  mission  visited  Madhya  Pradesh  in  2003,  and  assessed  the  financial \nsustainability, economic viability, and safeguards requirements of the investment for urban \n                                                 \n1  A revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Objectives and Scope \n6.  To help the government of Madhya Pradesh achieve the goal of sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in the largest cities of Madhya Pradesh, ADB approved a loan for \nfinancing the project for $200 million in December 2003. The project5 would achieve the goal by \n(i)  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  people  to  environmental  degradation,  poverty,  and  natural \nhazards; and (ii) increasing economic opportunities in the largest cities through improving (a) \nwater supply services, (b) sewerage and sanitation services, (c) storm-water drainage, (d) solid-\nwaste management services, and (e) slums and poor settlements. \n \n7.  The project comprises three parts: \n \n(i)  Part A: Urban water supply and environmental improvement. This covers the \nimprovement  and  expansion  of  the  following  municipal  infrastructure  and \nservices: (a) urban water supply, (b) sewerage and sanitation, (c) storm-water \ndrainage, and (d) solid-waste management. \n(ii)  Part B: Public participation and awareness program. This consists of (a) two \ncommunity funds that will be the basis for participatory planning between the \nmunicipal authorities and the poor communities of the neighborhood to integrate \nslum  improvements  with  citywide  infrastructure,  and  (b)  the  Water  for  Asian \nCities  Program  in  India  covering  urban  water  conservation  and  demand \nmanagement to be financed through parallel cofinancing by the United Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT). These activities were designed \nto strengthen the capacities of the project cities to plan and manage urban \ndevelopment in a more effective, transparent, and sustainable manner. \n(iii)  Part C: Project implementation assistance. This consists of support to the state \nproject management unit (PMU) and the city project implementation units (PIUs) \nwith activities immediately related to the implementation of the project. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n8.  The total cost of the project was initially estimated at $303.5 million equivalent (including \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $17.4  million  equivalent).  To  meet  the  estimated  project  cost,  the \nGovernment initially requested ADB to provide a loan of $200.0 million, which represented \n65.9% of the total cost of the project, from its ordinary capital resources (OCR). The loan had a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a 0.75% per annum \ncommitment  charge,  a  0.5%  front-end  fee,  conversion  options  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nConversion Guidelines,6 and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. UN-HABITAT provided and administered parallel grant cofinancing of $0.5 million. \n \n                                                 \n5  As a result of the Staff Instructions on Project Classification on 7 December 2004, the targeting classification of the \ninitial loan was revised from \u201cpoverty intervention\u201d to \u201ctargeted intervention-M.\u201d The project benefits from (i) \nimprovements in water supply, sanitation, and garbage collection and disposal within the project cities; and (ii) the \nconstruction of a tertiary water distribution network, and community latrines inside the slum settlements. It will also \ncontribute to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability in an inclusive \nmanner. \n6  ADB. 2008. Guidelines for Conversion of Loan Terms for ADB LIBOR-Based Loans. Manila  ", "  3\n9.  The Borrower was India and the foreign exchange risk was borne by the Government. \nThe Government was to pass the initial loan to the government of Madhya Pradesh as 70% \ndebt and 30% grant. The government of Madhya Pradesh was to onlend the full amount of the \nloan  portion  to  the  municipal  corporations  in  rupees  equivalent  at  10.5%  per  annum  with \nrepayments over 25 years including a grace period of 5 years. The grant portion was passed on \nto the government of Madhya Pradesh as a grant.  \n \n10.  In September 2004 before the loan signing, however, the Government requested ADB to \ncancel  $19  million  of  the  loan  amount.  This  was  because  two  out  of  the  six  municipal \ncorporations, namely Uijain and Ratlam, decided to opt out of such onlending arrangements. As \na result of the withdrawal, the total project cost was reduced by 9% to $275.0 million. After \nthorough assessment, ADB approved a reduction in the project scope and cancellation of the \nloan amount by $19 million. The loan and project agreements were signed in March 2005 for \n$181.0 million.

Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n11.  Overview. Despite initial slow progress of project implementation, the executing agency \n(EA) is strongly committed and project implementation is now progressing rapidly, as seen in \nthe expeditious tendering and implementation of contracts since 2007. This was a result of a \nmajor business process reengineering undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh from \nlate 2006 to streamline business procedures. The new business process became the strength of \nthe project, and it provided lessons to other projects in India. The effectiveness of the reform \nwas reflected in the record of contract awards. By 2006, only $16.7 million worth of contracts \nwere awarded out of the $181.0 million loan proceeds.7 However, by December 2007, the \ncontracts awarded out of the loan proceeds reached approximately $172.5 million. In other \nwords, the EA awarded contracts worth $155.8 million out of the loan proceeds in 2007 alone. \nThe social and environmental safeguards and the gender action plan are being complied with. \n(Appendix  2  provides  the  midterm  review  of  implementation  status.)  Notwithstanding  this \nachievement, there is still $81.7 million worth of works and supply contract packages that \nremain to be awarded in order to complete the original scope of the project. Thus, there is a \nserious financing shortfall. \n \n12.  Initial Weaknesses. The project was the first large-scale investment for the government \nof Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations. At the beginning of project implementation, \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations had no option but to use the \nexisting project implementation procedures, which were designed for locally financed projects \ninvolving works and supply contracts worth less than $100,000 each; the project, however, \ninvolved contracts worth at least $2 million. This resulted in a lengthy decision-making process \nwithin the government of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations. Also, the use of the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s schedule of rates (state-imposed ceilings on prices that were \nperiodically updated but did not necessarily reflect market rates) has led to substantial variation \nin  bid  prices  from  the  cost  estimate  of  larger  contract  packages.  A  substantial  difference \nbetween the cost estimate and the bid price called for rebidding. Some contractors became very \ncautious about the larger contracts with the municipal corporations, as the impact of payment \ndelay on their cash flow would become bigger if the amount of each payment was larger. \n \n13.  All of the weaknesses (lengthy decision making and inaccurate cost estimates) were \ninterconnected, and put project implementation into a vicious cycle of uncertainty and risk. Slow \ndecision making not only caused delay in contract awards but also late payment to contractors. \nWhen contractors wanted to tender despite various risks, they had to hedge their future risk by \n                                                 \n7  The contract award figures represent the value of the contracts which will be financed out of the loan proceeds in \naccordance with Schedule 3 of the loan agreement, and does not include the remaining portion to be financed by the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh and municipal corporations. ", "  5\nasking for a higher return. In other words, the risk premium pushed the bid price even higher. \nHigher bid prices resulted in the increased likelihood of rejection of all bids. Uncertainty in the \ntiming  of  contract  award  undermined  business  confidence,  which  further  discouraged \ncontractors\u2019 interest in the business opportunities. As a result, it was October 2006 before the \nmajor works contract was awarded. The cumulative contract award amount for the initial 20 \nmonths\u2014from the loan effectiveness in May 2005 to December 2006\u2014was virtually stagnant at \napproximately $16.7 million. \n \n14.  Business Process Reengineering. Collaborative and continuous efforts of the EA\u2019s \nPMU and ADB since 2005 started to bear fruit in 2007. The PMU realized it was imperative to \nbreak the vicious cycle in project implementation, and reformed its business procedures and \ncustoms in early 2007 on its own initiative. It introduced major reforms in three areas: \n \n(i)  Quick decision making. Initially, the decision on contract approval by municipal \ncorporations  was  made  through  a  municipal  corporation\u2019s  official  meeting \nattended by more than 50 elected local representatives every 2 months. After the \nreform, decision-making authority was delegated to the mayor-in-council of each \nmunicipal corporation.8 Also, before issuance of official correspondence to the \nPMU,  the  concerned  officers  of  the  PIUs  and  municipal  corporations  held \npreliminary dialogue to reach consensus. Once consensus was reached, official \nletters were sent to seek official approval from the respective PIUs, the PMU, and \nthe municipal corporations. This has substantially reduced the decision-making \ntime. \n \n(ii)  Reliable  costing  during  detailed  engineering  design.  In  the  early  project \nimplementation period, the government of Madhya Pradesh used a schedule of \nrates for the purpose of cost estimates and evaluation of bids which did not \nreflect  market  prices.  Moreover,  factors  which  would  raise  the  construction \ncosts\u2014such as locations, climates, soil conditions, and availability of construction \nmaterials\u2014were  not  taken  into  consideration.  As  a  result,  bid  prices  were \nsubstantially  higher  than  the  estimates.  To  minimize  underestimation  and/or \noverestimation errors, adequate steps have been taken, including (a) the use of \nan  updated  schedule  of  rates  and  market  rates  where  applicable,  and  (b) \nconsideration  for  factors  which  would  vary  the  construction  costs.  Increased \naccuracy in costing has given the empowered committee (the highest approving \nauthority  under  the  project)  more  confidence  in  the  PMU\u2019s  estimates  and \ndecisions, and has resulted in faster approval, even though there was variance \nbetween the government of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s schedule of rates and the PMU\u2019s \nestimates. \n \n(iii)  Confidence  building.  In  the  beginning  of  the  project,  there  was  a  general \nperception  among  suppliers  and  contractors  that  the  municipal  corporations \nwould require longer to process payment claims, which might potentially affect \nthe contractors\u2019 cash flow. When coupled with increasing business opportunities \nin the private sector in the booming Indian economy, such risks discouraged \ncontractors  from  seeking  business  under  government-financed  projects  and \nresulted in no bids to initial tenders under the project. To change the perception, \n                                                 \n8  The mayor-in-council is made up of the mayor, deputy mayor, and up to 10 elected members of the council named \nby the mayor. The mayor-in-council collectively has executive powers of the corporation and functions as a cabinet. \nThe mayor allocates work of the corporation's departments to different council members in the same way that the \nchief minister of the state government allocates different portfolios to his cabinet ministers. \n ", "6   \nADB and the PMU jointly organized a series of workshops in the project cities to \nraise  the  awareness  of  potential  contractors.  This  helped  the  contractors  to \nunderstand that the municipal corporations had a secure fund source to make \nimmediate payment to contractors, even though the contract sizes were larger. \nAlso, the PMU made a commitment to pay 80% of the claimed payment in 3 \ndays. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n15.  The reason for the cost overrun is an increase in original cost estimates, caused mainly \nby two factors: (i) the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, and (ii) price escalation of \nconstruction materials in India. Initial slow startup of project implementation also had an adverse \neffect on the two factors. Out of the financing gap estimated at $108 million, rupee appreciation \naccounts for $77 million and the price escalation for about $31 million. \n \n(i)  Appreciation  of  the  rupee.  The  project  cost  was  estimated  in  rupees  and \nconverted to dollars using the exchange rates forecast at the time of the loan \nappraisal  in  2003.  The  value  of  $1  throughout  project  implementation  was \nestimated at Rs50 during the appraisal of the initial loan. However, it sharply \nreduced to Rs40 by May 2007, and has remained close to that level throughout \nthe appraisal of the supplementary loan. In other words, the original project cost \nin dollars increased by $77 million, from $275 million to $352 million. Accordingly, \nto maintain the ADB financing amount in rupees, the loan amount in dollars \nneeds to be increased by $50.6 million, from $181.0 million to $231.6 million. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange \nfluctuation. \n \n(ii)  Escalation of construction material prices. By the time of the major contract \nawards in 2007, the unit costs of goods and materials had risen significantly \nsince the original cost estimates for the project were prepared in 2003.9 High \ndemand  for  construction  materials  in  the  booming  Indian  economy10  and  a \nworldwide increase in oil prices have led to high price escalation of construction \nmaterials. Based on the revised cost estimates, the overall increase in the project \ncost in rupees is Rs1.2 billion (a 9% increase), equivalent to $31 million. While \nthe average annual inflation rate, based on India\u2019s wholesale price index, was \naround  5.5%  during  2003\u20132007,  there  was  a  significant  price  increase  in \nconstruction materials\u2014the price index of steel increased by 11.6%, cement \nincreased  by  9.8%,  and  fuel  increased  9.3%  per  year  on  average.  The \ngovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  requested  ADB  through  the  Government  to \nfinance the increment at the same proportional rate as it had the initial loan (i.e., \n                                                 \n9  An assessment was also made to identify whether the cost overrun was also caused by underestimations of the \ninput cost. In urban projects there are generally some variations in contract price estimates between the PPTA \ndetailed engineering design stages. This is because more detailed engineering and market data after the PPTA \nimprove the accuracy of unit price estimates. Under this project, the impact of the unit price adjustment on the total \ncost after detailed engineering design was not significant and, if it had been the only change, could have been \naccommodated through the physical contingencies provision. Appendix 4 provides a comparison between contract \nprice estimates at the PPTA stage and the bid results. \n10  The construction component of the gross domestic product (GDP) in India increased by 10.7% to 14.2% per year \nbetween 2003 and 2007, while the manufacturing component increased by 6.6% to 12.3%, and the services \ncomponent increased by 8.9% to 11.9%. ", "  7\n$20.4 million, which is 65.8% of $31 million). Appendix 3 provides a detailed \nanalysis of the impact of price escalation. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project  \n16.  Undermining System Integrity. There were approximately 120 major contracts under \nthe original scope of the project. From the total number of contracts, the PMU allotted the initial \nloan to finance about 80 of the contracts. The government of Madhya Pradesh has to search for \nadditional  resources  to  finance  the  remaining  40  contracts.  Without  implementation  of  the \nremaining contracts, system integrity of the urban infrastructure will be severely undermined. \nFor example, the augmented water production system of Indore and Jabalpur cannot be fully \nutilized in the absence of a reliable water distribution system in the existing and new areas. \nSewage collected from the new sewerage network system in Gwalior will have no option but to \nflow into the river without treatment if there is no sewage treatment system. Conversely, there \nwill be no sewage to be treated in the sewage treatment plant in Bhopal without the new \nsewerage networks system. Similarly, while more urban waste will be collected using new \nequipment, such collected waste will not be properly and safely disposed of in the absence of \nsanitary landfill sites. Supplementary Appendix A presents the existing and pending works in a \ngraphical way to illustrate systemic integrity. \n \n17.  Reduction in Beneficiaries. An incomplete system of urban infrastructure will result in a \nreduction in the number of beneficiaries (Table 3). Across the sector, not only will there be about \na 35% reduction in the number of beneficiaries, but also beneficiaries will be connected to \nincomplete systems of urban infrastructure. In particular, the number of beneficiaries of water \nsupply optimization will be reduced by 46%, and the number of beneficiaries of water supply \nexpansion will be reduced by 38%.  \n \nTable 3: Estimated Number of Project Beneficiaries by Scenario \n(million) \nItem  Complete Scope  Incomplete Scope \nWater supply optimization 5.6   3.0 \nWater supply expansion  1.3   0.8 \nSewerage and drainage  1.6   1.2 \nSolid waste management  4.7   3.6 \nSource:  Project  management  unit  estimates  based  on  baseline  report  by  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation consultants, April 2007 \n \nC.  Rationale \n18.  Implications for Economic Viability and Financial Sustainability. According to the \ninitial economic and financial analyses undertaken during the loan appraisal in 2003,11 there are \nserious implications of the reduction in the beneficiaries on economic viability and financial \nsustainability. Being a high priority project, these pending works will have to be carried out by \nthe municipal corporations in any case, but it is not clear when the government of Madhya \nPradesh and the municipal corporations can secure the full funds. Therefore, there will be a \ndelay in the realization of the full benefit for an unknown period. The sensitivity analysis of the \ninitial economic analysis shows that, although the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of \nmost of the subprojects in adverse conditions were higher than the economic opportunity cost of \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. Manila (Appendixes 11 \nand 13). \n ", "8   \ncapital (EOCC),12 the extent of reduction in the EIRR is higher for a 1-year delay in benefit \n(19%\u201345%) than for a 10% capital cost increase (7%\u201322%). Similarly, the sensitivity analysis of \nthe initial financial analysis shows that, while most of the subprojects earned a financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),13 the extent of \nreduction in the FIRR is higher for a 1-year delay in benefit (13%\u201368%) than for a 10% capital \ncost increase (3%\u201368%). If the realization of benefit is delayed for more than 1 year, the extent \nof  benefit  reduction  will  become  greater.  In  other  words,  there  is  a  clear  indication  that \ncompletion of the full scope of the project is more financially sustainable and economically \nviable  than  leaving  the  project  incomplete  for  an  unknown  period  until  the  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations identify new funding sources to complete the \nproject. \n \n19.  Search for Financial Resources. ADB officially warned of the possible risk of a cost \noverrun in mid-2007 and the PMU was already aware that it would not be able to award new \ncontracts from early 2008 due to exhaustion of loan proceeds, and that this would result in a \ndelay to project implementation. The government of Madhya Pradesh did not have enough \nfinancial capacity to finance the remaining scope in a short period, as it had been in a fiscally \nweak position for several years. The municipal corporations had cash surpluses, but these were \ntoo small to meet the investment cost. As the project is a priority of the government of Madhya \nPradesh and in order to complete the original project scope, the municipal corporations in \nassociation  with  the  PMU  actively  looked  for  additional  financial  resources  in  2007.  They \nconsequently identified three financial sources for the works related to about 10 contracts: \n \n(i)  Government grants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n(JNNURM) to finance a large portion of works for the sewerage networks in \nIndore, \n(ii)  Government  grants  under  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for \nSmall and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) to finance a large portion of works for the \nsewerage network and the sewage treatment plant in Gwalior, and \n(iii)  the  municipal  corporations\u2019  own  budget  to  finance  some  contracts  for  water \nsupply optimization in Gwalior and a large portion of works related to sanitary \nlandfill development in Bhopal. \n \n20.  Financial  Position  of  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Municipal \nCorporations.  Since mid-2007, the government of Madhya Pradesh has assessed various \nborrowing options to secure financial resources for the remaining 30 contracts. The municipal \ncorporations\u2019 financial capacity has been improving, yet is still weak; high costs of borrowing \nmight jeopardize the municipal corporations\u2019 efforts to improve their financial position. The \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh and the municipal corporations compared the cost of borrowing \nbetween  ADB  loans  and  other  development  loans  in  India,  and  found  that  while  the \ndevelopment loans were as competitive as ADB loans in pricing, ADB loans had the advantage \nof a longer repayment period with a grace period. Further, the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand  the  municipal  corporations  recognized  value-additions  of  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance, \nespecially ADB\u2019s emphasis on collaborative capacity building through sharing of successful \nexperiences  in  other  projects  in  India  and  the  region,  and  exposure  to  urban  services \nmanagement in advanced economies in Asia. The PMU decided to finance the remaining 30 \n                                                 \n12 In the original economic analysis, water supply in Indore, sewerage and sanitation in Gwalior and Jabalpur, and \nsolid-waste management in Gwalior were lower than the economic opportunity cost of capital in adverse conditions. \n13 In the original financial analysis, water supply in Indore; sewerage and sanitation in Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur; \nand solid-waste management in Bhopal and Jabalpur were lower than the weighted average cost of capital in \nadverse conditions. ", "  9\ncontracts from an additional ADB loan, and the government of Madhya Pradesh made an official \nrequest for supplementary financing to ADB through the Government in early 2008. \n \n21.  Implementation Readiness. Out of the remaining contracts (of which there are about \n30), nine are ready to be awarded14 expecting ADB\u2019s retroactive financing. Detailed engineering \ndesign will be completed for eight contracts before September 2008 and for all remaining \ncontracts before January 2009. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates  \n22.  Revised  costs  for  the  project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $383 million including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies, and financing charges during implementation. Table 4 summarizes the revised \ncost estimates for the project. Details of revised cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 4: Revised Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Revised Costa\nA.

Financing charges are estimated, assuming an \ninterest rate computed at the 6-month London interbank offered rate and a spread of 20 \nbasis points, and a commitment fee of 0.15%. \nSources: Asian Development Bank\u2019s current applicable policies and the project management \nunit estimates. \n \nE.  Revised Financing Plan \n23.  The initial loan of $181 million was allocated from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR). With an additional $71 million proposed under the supplementary loan from ADB\u2019s OCR, \nthe total available ADB loan amount will be $252 million. The repayments of the supplementary \nOCR loan will be fully synchronized with the repayments of the initial loan. Consequently, the \nsupplementary  OCR  loan  will  have  a  term  of  20  years,  no  grace  period,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \n                                                 \n14 Procurements are being carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n ", "10  \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s \nown independent decision and not in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n24.  Under the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will cover 65.8% ($252 \nmillion) of the total investment costs of $383 million. The proposed supplementary loan will \ncover 65.7% ($71 million) of the additional financing requirement of $108 million, which will \nfinance a portion of civil works, equipment, consulting services, and funds for municipal action \nplanning  for  poverty  reduction.  The  financing  charges  during  implementation  will  not  be \ncapitalized in the ADB loans. Of the total investment costs, the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand municipal corporations will finance 34.1%, which will include incremental administration, \nfinancial charges, taxes and duties, land, and a portion of civil works, equipment, consulting \nservices, and funds for municipal action planning for poverty reduction. The UN-HABITAT will \ncontinue  financing  0.1%  ($0.5  million)  of  the  total  investment  cost  through  parallel  grant \ncofinancing for implementation of the Water for Asian Cities Program. The proposed financing \nplan is summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Revised Financing Plan \nSource  $ Million  Percent \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Initial financing    181.0     47.3  \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Supplementary financing    71.0     18.5  \nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh and Municipal Corporations     \nInitial financing    93.5     24.4  \nSupplementary financing    37.0     9.7  \nUnited Nations Human Settlement Programme    0.5     0.1  \nTotal    383.0     100.0  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n25.  The  Government  of  India  will  pass  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  on  to  the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh on the same terms as the ADB loan. The government of \nMadhya Pradesh will then onlend a portion of the loan to the municipal corporations on similar \nterms and conditions as that for the initial loan to be synchronous with the initial loan repayment \nperiod. The existing onlending agreement, signed between the government of Madhya Pradesh \nand the municipal corporations, will be revised, as acceptable to ADB, limited to reflect the \nchanges arising from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \nF.  Remedial Steps \n26.  Various remedial measures are already in place through the collaborative effort of the \nPMU and ADB to achieve timely implementation and reliable costing as described earlier. The \neffectiveness of the remedial measures was reflected in the amount of contract awards in 2007. \nTo prevent further cost overruns, the EA will minimize the impact of (i) further price escalation \nby awarding about $39 million worth of contracts through advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing in 2008, and the remaining contracts in 2009; and (ii) further rupee appreciation by \nmaking a provision for larger price contingency, the majority of which will be financed by the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  Implementation arrangements for the project under the proposed supplementary loan, \nincluding project management; procurement (a procurement plan is in Appendix 6); consulting ", "  11\nservices;  anticorruption  policy; 15   disbursement  arrangements;  accounting,  auditing,  and \nreporting; project performance monitoring and evaluation; and project review remain the same \nas those in the initial loan, as amended to date, except three specific aspects:16\n \n(i)  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  The EA requested ADB\u2019s \napproval of (a) advance contracting to recruit consultants and to procure goods \nand civil works; and (b) retroactive financing of up to 20% of the proposed \nsupplementary  loan  amount  for  eligible  expenditures,  including  consultants, \ngoods, and civil works, incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing of the Loan Agreement. Advance contracting and \nretroactive financing are necessary to avoid any disruption and to ensure smooth \nand continuous project implementation. The EA has been advised that ADB\u2019s \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not constitute a \ncommitment  to  finance  the  supplementary  loan.  (Contracts  for  retroactive \nfinancing are indicated in the procurement plan.) \n \n(ii)  Revised  implementation  period.  The project was originally expected to be \nimplemented over 5 years with a project completion date of 31 March 2009. The \nPMU was unable to assign the design and construction supervision consultants \n(DSCs) to undertake further detailed engineering design for some of the pending \nworks  contracts.  It  was  only  when  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \napproached ADB through the Government for a supplementary loan that it had \ngood prospects for funding sources for construction activities. Considering the \ndelay in detailed engineering design, the completion date of the project will be \nextended to 31 March 2011. A revised implementation schedule is included in \nAppendix 7. Accordingly, the project completion date in the initial loan is also \nproposed to be extended to 31 March 2011. \n \n(iii)  Continuous engagement of consultants. Under the initial loan for the project, \nan international consulting firm was engaged in 2005 as the project management \nconsultants and two national consulting firms as the DSC, and domestic firms as \npublic  relations  consultants  and  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  consultants, \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  quality-based  selection  procedures.  Existing  consultancy \ncontracts will expire in December 2009. The EA has found the performance of all \nfirms to be satisfactory. In order to obtain the equivalent level of consultants\u2019 \nassistance  during  the  extended  period  of  project  implementation,  additional \nconsulting services under the DSC (1,417 person-months), the public relations \nconsultancy  (116  person-months)  and  the  benefit  monitoring  evaluation \nconsultancy  (23  person-months)  contracts  will  be  required.  The  proposed \nadditional  consulting  services  may  be  provided  by  the  respective  currently \nengaged  firms  during  the  extended  project  implementation  period  through \n                                                 \n15 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  again  with  the \nGovernment and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the project. \n16 The three aspects are not due to, and will not result in, a change in the original scope and/or design, or modified or \nincremental activities or components, but will facilitate implementation of the project during the transition between \nthe initial loan and supplementary financing. \n ", "12  \nvariation orders following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  applicable  provisions  set  forth  in  the \nrespective  contracts.  Continuous  assignment  through  variation  orders  is \nconsidered  to  be  the  most  efficient  and  advantageous  method  for  extended \nengagement of the consultants because (a) selection of new consultants will put \nthe project on hold for at least 6 months and will cause further delay; (b) the \nproposed tasks represent a natural continuation of their previous work; (c) the \nterms of reference of respective consulting services will remain unchanged; and \n(d)  the  existing  consultants\u2019  professional  liabilities,  technical  approach,  and \napplication of the experience required and gained will be continued. When the \nloan  proceeds  allocated  to  consulting  services  under  the  initial  loan  are \nexhausted, loan proceeds under the supplementary loan will continue to finance \nthe existing contracts until the end of project implementation. The estimated \nvariation  amounts  for  each  contract  are  not  more  than  50%  of  the  original \ncontract value in the currency of payment.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n28.  The increase in the original cost estimates was caused by rupee appreciation and price \nincreases. There is no (i) physical change within the original scope and/or design, or modified or \nincremental activities or components; and (ii) change in environment and social safeguards \nrequirements. Therefore, the project benefit, impacts, assumptions, and risks will remain the \nsame as the initial loan, except for the project impacts on financial sustainability and economic \nvalidity. \n \n29.  Financial Sustainability. Financial analysis (Appendix 8) reassessed the sustainability \nof all revenue-generating subprojects, taking the revised cost estimates and the rescheduled \nindicative financial improvement action plan (FIAP) into consideration. The WACC is estimated \nat 3.8%. The FIRRs in the base case are estimated at 3.5\u201312.9% for water supply subprojects, \nat  3.5\u20134.7%  for  the  sewerage  subproject,  and  6.4\u201318.5%  for  solid-waste  management \nsubprojects. The FIRRs are lower than the WACC for sewerage subprojects in Bhopal and \nIndore. These subprojects also had comparatively lower FIRRs in the initial financial analysis. \nHowever, combined FIRRs for water supply and sewerage are all above the WACC. Despite the \nlow level of the FIRR, the sewerage subprojects in Bhopal and Indore will generate adequate \nrevenue to sustain operation and maintenance (O&M). Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to \ntest the robustness of the financial sustainability to changes in subproject parameters. The \nresults indicate that the FIRRs in all sectors are most sensitive to reduction in the incremental \nrevenue. This suggests that, in order to realize higher financial returns, (i) the planned coverage \nof  services  needs  to  be  achieved,  and  (ii)  the  rescheduled  indicative  FIAP  needs  to  be \nimplemented on time. \n \n30.  The initial indicative FIAP was formulated with a philosophy that people would not accept \nany tariff increase unless there were visible improvements in urban services. It was envisaged \nthat major tariff increases would start from the second year of project implementation, when \nmore people became aware (through public awareness campaigns) of the value of better urban \ninfrastructure  for  maintaining  public  hygiene  at  a  higher  level,  and  some  new  urban \ninfrastructure became operational. In reality, however, it was only in the second half of 2007 that \nthe  majority  of  contracts  were  awarded  to  the  contractor.  Although  there  has  been  good \nprogress in implementation of works, major infrastructure is still under construction and will \nbecome operational after 2009. In order to implement the indicative FIAP with full understanding \nof the people in the cities, the implementation schedule of the indicative FIAP was revised to ", "  13\nsynchronize with the progress of physical investment and the reform agenda under JNNURM. \nWhile the final target year will be delayed by 1 year, there is no change in the final targets for \nthe user charges of various services from the initial indicative FIAP. The rescheduled indicative \nFIAP is presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n31.  Economic  Viability.  All  subprojects  are  economically  viable,  in  spite  of  the  cost \nincrease, with the estimated EIRR values exceeding the EOCC in all cases. Economic analysis \nis presented in Appendix 9. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the \neconomic viability to changes in subproject parameters. The results indicate that the EIRRs are \nsensitive to a 1-year delay in realization of the economic benefits in some subprojects and a \nreduction in beneficiary levels in other subprojects. This suggests that, in order to realize higher \neconomic benefits, (i) timely completion of works and smooth transition to operation are crucial, \nand (ii) the planned coverage of services needs to be achieved. \n \n32.

Background \n \n1.  A midterm review mission visited Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur in February and \nMarch  2008  to  assess  the  implementation  progress  of  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. This appendix summarizes the major \nfindings of the midterm review. \n \nB.  Project Management \n \n2.  The highest decision-making authority of the project, the empowered committee, was \nformed in 2004 under the chairmanship of the chief secretary of the government of Madhya \nPradesh. The project management unit (PMU) was established under the executing agency \n(EA), the Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD), in 2005 to manage the \noverall  implementation  of  the  project.  A  steering  committee  was  formed  in  2004  in  each \nmunicipal corporation to guide each subproject, and project implementation units (PIUs) were \nestablished in each municipal corporation in 2005 to implement the project. All consultants\u2014the \nproject  management  consultants,  two  groups  of  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nconsultants,  the  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  consultants,  and  the  public  relations \nconsultants\u2014were fielded in 2006. \n \nC.  Part A: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement  \n \n3.  Bhopal. There were 24 works contracts under implementation, and five contracts to be \nawarded (Table A2.1). All designs reflected the least-cost analysis undertaken during ADB\u2019s \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  The  works  were  being  executed  as  per \ncontract conditions with good quality-control. The midterm review noted slow progress of works \nrelated to (i) the sewage treatment plant at Maholi Dhamkheda; (ii) the laying of sanitary sewers; \nand  (iii)  the  laying  of  distribution  networks  in  wards  1,  2,  3,  and  4.  Particularly,  delay  in \nproduction of distribution pipes requires urgent attention. The contractors will prepare a revised \nimplementation schedule in consultation with the PIU. \n \nTable A2.1: Status of Contract Awards in Bhopal \n \n       Bids under    Bids to be \nContracts Awarded  Process  Invited \n    Rs  $      Rs      $       Rs     $ \nItem  No.  (million)    No.  (million)    No.   (million) \nWater Supply  10  526  13.5  2  110  2.8   2  165  4.2\nSewerage, Drainage, and  3  605  15.5  1  227  5.8   0    0\nSanitation \nSolid Waste Management   11  53  1.4  0  0  0   0    0\n  Total  24  1,184  30.4  3  337  8.6   2  165  4.2\nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n4.  Gwalior. There were nine works contracts under implementation and six contracts to be \nawarded (Table A2.2). All designs reflected the least-cost analysis undertaken during ADB\u2019s \nPPTA. The works were being executed as per contract conditions with good quality-control. The \nmidterm review noted that the performance of the works related to (i) the raw water pumping ", "  Appendix 2  21\nstation and the water treatment plant; (ii) the raw water pumping main and clear water pumping \nmain; and (iii) rehabilitation of the existing water treatment plants and pumping station, need to \nfurther  improve  by  deploying  additional  resources  to  complete  the  works  in  time.

Indore. Indore had the largest financial allocation under the project. Augmentation of the \nwater supply was the major component. Works involved construction of a raw water intake with \npumping station, a water treatment plant, three new clear water pumping stations, the laying of \n25  km  of  rising  mains,  55  km  of  gravity  mains,  and  distribution  networks  with  balancing \nreservoirs. All designs reflected the least-cost analysis undertaken during ADB\u2019s PPTA. There \nwere 28 works contracts under implementation and 12 contracts to be awarded (Table A2.3). \nDespite the number of contracts, the works were executed as per contract conditions with good \nquality-control. Considering efficient contract management and supervision of the PIU in Indore, \nthere is a good prospect for completion of works on time. \n \nTable A2.3: Status of Contract Awards in Indore \n \n   Contracts Awarded    Bids under    Bids to be Invited \nProcess \n    Rs  $       Rs       $      Rs   $ \nItem  No.   (million)    No.    (million)    No.    (million) \nWater Supply  17  4,453  114.2    3  284 7.3   7  1,325  34.0 \nSewerage, Drainage, and  1  14  0.4    0  0 0   1  100    2.6 \nSanitation \nSolid-Waste Management   10  72  1.8    0  0 0   1  109    2.8 \n  Total  28  4,539  116.4    3  284 7.3   9  1,534  39.4 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n6.

Part B: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement. \n \n7.  Water for Asian Cities Program in India. The Water for Asian Cities (WAC) program1 \nwas a joint collaboration between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations \nHuman Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) to catalyze investments into urban water supply \nand sanitation for the poor. The WAC program mainly consisted of capacity-building programs, \nsmall-scale projects, and studies related to water and sanitation management. For example, it \nhas undertaken the setting-up of water-sanitation classrooms to share knowledge on sanitation \nwith juveniles. The WAC program particularly benefited the project through implementing pilot \nprojects on (i) community-based water supply schemes; and (ii) community toilets schemes in \nslums, with participation of the local communities. These schemes are operational and are \nmanaged by community groups of local women. The WAC program has also organized a \nworkshop on water demand-management strategies to raise awareness among the people and \nthe municipal corporation staff on metering, leak detection and repair, rationalization of tariffs, \nand accounting and billing reforms. \n \n8.  Funds  for  Municipal  Action  Planning  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  EA  initially \ndeferred activities of the area improvement fund and community initiatives fund as similar work \nwas  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Services  Program,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. In April 2007, however, the EA decided to implement the \narea improvement fund and the community initiatives fund, using the methodology established \nby the WAC program. The PMU has proposed to implement 10 community toilets schemes in \nBhopal, Gwalior, Indore, and Jabalpur, and has identified slums for implementation. Community \ngroups of local women would oversee operation and maintenance of these toilets based on user \ncharges. During the site visits to the proposed slums, all the women members of registered \ngroups showed their keenness to be associated with the project. The engineering design would \nbe developed with assistance of the respective PIUs. Works would be executed by contractors \nunder supervision of the local women resident committees. The PMU would submit the concept \nreport by the end of April 2008 to ADB for clearance. Due to paucity of funds, these works were \nproposed to be taken up under the supplementary loan. \n \nE.  Part C: Implementation Assistance \n \n9.  Public Relations and Awareness Program. In each project city, the PIU conducted \npublic awareness campaigns and participatory programs in compliance with loan covenants. As \npart of the scope of the project, an awareness campaign was undertaken through various \n                                                 \n1  UN-Habitat. 2003.

Beneficiaries \nhave also been made aware of citizens' responsibilities to avoid wasting water, user charges for \nwater and sewerage services, and property tax reform for achieving the goals of the project. The \nfeedback and concerns received from the people during the campaign were reviewed by the \nPMU, and were reflected in project implementation. \n \nF.  Loan Covenants \n \n10.  The  general  covenants  related  to  project  implementation,  financial  audits,  statutory \ncompliances, and safeguards are being complied with. There were some minor delays (mostly \nrelated  to  institutional  reforms)  in  meeting  compliance  date  targets.  For  example, \nimplementation of the financial improvement action plan (FIAP) has been slow due to delay in \nworks. All cities have agreed to the water tariff increase, but some cities found it difficult to \nincrease tariffs with the full understanding of the people without visible improvements in urban \ninfrastructure. Fortunately, Jabalpur and Indore have successfully implemented the increase. \nDuring the midterm review wrap-up meeting in Bhopal, the principal secretary of the UADD \nemphasized the importance of tariff increases, and urged the commissioner of each city to take \nimmediate action to successfully implement the FIAP. \n \nG.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n11.  Land  Acquisition  and  Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement requirement remained unchanged as there was no physical change within the \noriginal scope and design. The social safeguard requirements therefore remain the same. The \nmidterm  review  confirmed  that  social  safeguards  addressed  under  the  project  were  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998), and the National Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended 1984) and applicable \nstate  policies.  As  was  originally  envisaged,  the  land  acquisition  requirements  have  been \nminimized. The proposed works would be carried out on available government land free of \nstructures  and  not  used  for  cultivation  or  grazing.  At  the  time  of  loan  appraisal,  a  short \nresettlement plan2 (SRP) was prepared for a site for construction of an integrated sewage \ntreatment plant and sanitary landfill in Jabalpur. The SPR was updated by the EA in August \n2007, and was reviewed and approved by ADB in September 2007. \n \n12.  The updated SRP set out the procedure for the acquisition of 78.3 hectares (ha) of land \nin Kathonda. Out of the 78.3 ha, 47.5 ha was vacant government land and the remaining 30.8 \nha was private land. A total of 17 titleholders (99 persons) and eight nontitled families (54 \npersons) were affected by either full or partial loss of property. The nongovernment organization \n(NGO) appointed for the implementation of the SRP will be responsible for conducting meetings \nand consultation with the nontitled affected families. All affected persons will be compensated in \naccordance with the entitlement matrix of the approved SRP. The EA agreed that the social \ndevelopment officer of the PIU will monitor the implementation of the SRP and provide regular \nreports to ADB as part of the quarterly progress reports. \n \n13.  For the ongoing works, there was no relocation of roadside kiosks during pipe laying in \nroad corridors and other works. For the pending works on pipe laying in road corridors, the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

During  the  mission,  a  focused  refresher \nworkshop on social safeguards was provided to the project managers, social and community \ndevelopment officers of all PIUs and PMU staff, consultants, and NGOs. \n \n14.  Environmental Clearances. The mitigation measures proposed in the original initial \nenvironmental  examination  have  been  incorporated  into  the  design  and  initial  construction \nactivities. Bidding documents address environmental requirements and the design of packages \nhas been conducted to minimize and/or prevent any impacts. Environmental checklists have \nbeen prepared to aid monitoring activities and extensive training has been provided in relation to \nmonitoring of potential environmental impacts relating to construction activities. Requests to \nobtain environmental clearances from the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board have been \ninitiated in most instances. The EA agreed on the time-bound action plan to urgently obtain \nnecessary clearances. \n \n15.  Environmental Management and Monitoring. An adequate level of care has been \ntaken in implementing required environmental mitigation measures and monitoring plans. The \nmidterm  review  made  the  following  recommendations  to  ensure  and  further  improve \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring:  (i)  additional  resources  to  be  allocated  for \nenvironmental monitoring under the project, such as (a) an additional overall planning and \nmanagement expert under the project management consultancy, and (b) an environment expert \nas part of the design and supervision consultancy in each PIU; (ii) a groundwater quality testing \nprogram to be put in place to set baselines for all new and existing sewage treatment plants and \nsanitary landfill sites; (iii) sludge handling and disposal plants to be put in place for all cities with \nexisting and new water treatment plants and sewage treatment plants; and (iv) the PIUs and the \ncontractors to continue training on occupational health and safety and environmental monitoring \nchecklists. \n \n16.  Gender  Action  Plan.  The  gender  action  plan  has  been  updated  by  the  EA  and \ntranslated into the local language. A training program for the project staff and the municipal \ncorporations was scheduled to be conducted from June 2008. \n \nH.  Audit and Monitoring \n \n17.  Project Accounts and Audit. Project accounts has been maintained both manually and \nusing computerized accounting software (named Tally) at the PMU and the PIUs. Accounting \nrecords have been maintained and updated regularly. Bank reconciliations have been carried \nout regularly and outstanding items have been regularly followed up. A project accounting \nmanual was developed and has been adopted by the  PMU and the PIUs. The municipal \ncorporations were subject to internal audit and pre-audit by the local fund auditor appointed by \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh. In addition, the project accounts were subject to audit by \nan independent auditor appointed by the UADD, and audit has been completed for the period up \nto 31 March 2007. Reimbursement claims have been properly prepared and submitted to ADB, \nthrough the Borrower, for reimbursement. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB and Government of Madhya Pradesh. 2004.

Summary. There is a cost overrun of $108 million for the Urban Water Supply and \nEnvironmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. There are two major reasons for this: \n(i) appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, and (ii) price escalation of construction materials \nin India. The appreciation of the rupee accounts for about $77 million (the first row of Table \nA3.1) of the overrun, and the price escalation for about $31 million (the fourth column of Table \nA3.1). This appendix provides further details. \n \nTable A3.1: Summary Table of Cost Overrun Analysis \n(million) \n    US Dollar  US Dollar   \n    Assumptions  Assumptions   \n    during Loan  during Loan  US Dollar \n    Appraisal   Appraisal   Cost Overrun \n  Indian   in 2003  in 2008  due to \nItem  Rupees  ($1 = Rs49.9)  ($1 = Rs39.0)  Exchange Rate\nOriginal Project Cost  13,700       275.0      352.0      77.0 \nRevised Project Cost  14,900  n/c      383.0   \nCost Overrun \n  due to Price Escalation  1,200  n/c        31.0   \nn/c = not converted. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n2.  Appreciation  of  the  Rupee.  Project  costs  were  computed  in  rupees,  with  foreign \nexchange  costs  translated  into  rupees  at  the  projected  exchange  rate  for  the  year  of \nexpenditure. Project costs were prepared in nominal terms, taking into account the effects of \ninflation and foreign currency fluctuations. Purchasing power parity was the base assumption \nwith exchange rates expected to fluctuate, and is embedded in cost estimation software, Costab \n32, which has been distributed via the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website. The concept of \npurchasing  power  parity  implies  that,  when  domestic  inflation  is  higher  than  international \ninflation, the value of local currency is reduced in the following year. At the time of the loan \nappraisal of the project in 2003, international inflation was estimated at 2.4% and domestic \ninflation  was  estimated  at  5.0%.  It  was  forecast  that  the  rupee  would  depreciate  and  the \nexchange rate would become Rs49.9 per $1 on average during project implementation. \n \nTable A3.2: ADB Financing Amount in Indian Rupees and US Dollars \n(million) \n    US Dollar  US Dollar   \n    Assumptions  Assumptions   \n    during Loan  during Loan  US Dollar \n  Appraisal   Appraisal   Financing Gap \n  in 2003  in 2008  due to \nItem  Indian Rupees  ($1 = Rs49.9)  ($1 = Rs39.0)  Exchange Rate\nOriginal total financing  13,700  275.0   352.0   77.0  \nOriginal ADB financing  9,000  181.0   231.6   50.6  \nOriginal GMP and municipal \ncorporations financing  4,700  n/c  n/c  n/c \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GMP = government of Madhya Pradesh, n/c = not converted, US = United States. \na  The cost incurred in rupees was financed by rupees. In other words, Rs4.7 billion was not affected by the \nexchange rate fluctuation. \nSources: ADB and the project management unit estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 3  27\n3.  In reality, however, and contrary to the forecast, the rupee appreciated by the time the \nproject started awarding the major contracts. Figure A3.1 on page 29 shows a large volume of \ncontracts awarded in the second half of 2007 (Supplementary Appendix B). The progress \npayments under these contracts use the foreign exchange rate of the date of payment, and \nthese progress payments will continue until 2010. The value of $1 had substantially reduced to \naround Rs39 by November 2007. Consequently, in order to maintain the ADB financing amount \nof  Rs9  billion  to  pay  for  the  contracts,  the  loan  amount  requirement  in  dollar  terms  has \nincreased from $181 million to $232 million in 2008. In other words, there is a financing gap of \n$51 million (Table A3.2). \n \n4.  Price Escalation of Construction Materials. The project cost in Indian rupee terms \nincreased by Rs1.2 billion (or by 8.8%) from Rs13.7 billion to Rs14.9 billion (Table A3.3). While \nsome  cost items  were  reduced  due  to  revisions  of  the input  requirements  during  detailed \nengineering design, the major cause of the project cost increase was the price escalation in civil \nworks, which increased by 11.0%. \n \nTable A3.3: Changes in Project Cost in Indian Rupee Terms \n(Rs million) \nOriginal  Revised  Change \nCost Items  Cost Estimates  Cost Estimates  Rs Million  % \nCivil Works  8,300   9,200   900  11.0 \nEquipment  1,300   1,400   100  7.7 \nConsulting Services  800   800   0  0.0 \nProject Administration  200   200   0  0.0 \nOthers  2,600   2,500   (100)  (4.0) \nTax and Duties  500   800   300  60.0 \n  Total  13,700   14,900   1,200  8.8 \n( ) = negative. \nNotes:  Contingencies were not able to cover the shortfall, as there was no financing source for contingencies due to \nrupee appreciation. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the project management unit estimates. \n \n5.  The price of a civil works contract comprises labor, construction materials, fuel, and \ncontractor\u2019s profit. There was a gradual increase in the cost of construction materials between \n2003  and  2007.  In  an  urban  development  project,  civil  works  generally  requires  steel  for \nreinforced concrete and large pipes, cement for construction and pipes, plastic for pipes, and \nfuel  for  operation  of  heavy  machinery  and  freight.  All  these  materials  experienced  price \nescalation, yet the extent of the increase varies from one material to another (Figure A3.2, page \n30). \n \n6.  A large volume of contracts were awarded in the second half of 2007. These contracts \nreflected the materials\u2019 prices at that time. The cost of materials constitutes about 65\u201375% of a \ntypical civil works contract in the urban development sector. Based on an estimate of a typical \ncomposition of the material required in works, the weighted average increase in construction \nmaterial cost between 2003 and 2007 is estimated at 39\u201348% (Table A3.4). The labor cost, \nwhich generally constitutes 10\u201320% of contract values, also increased about 22% between \n2003 and 2007. Overall, there was escalation of contract prices of about 29\u201331% between the \noriginal estimates and the contract award prices. Nevertheless, the extent of increase varies in \nrelation to the nature of works. For example, works requiring heavy use of steel and cement \nmight  have  increased the  contract  price  by  as  much  as  45%,  whereas  waterworks  laying \npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes might have experienced a moderate increase of around 30% \nbetween 2003 and 2007. \n ", " 28  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.4: Price Indexa of Major Construction Materials in 2003 and 2007 \n   Average  Average  Percentage  Weight  Average \nPrice Index Item  in 2003  in 2007  Change  (%)  (%) \nWater Supply         \nSteel  176  268  52.4  27  14.0 \nCement  146  212  45.0  40  18.0 \nPlastic Products  132  152  15.2  27  4.0 \nFuel  270  382  41.7  7  2.8 \nWeighted Average        100  38.8 \nSewerage           \nSteel  176  268  52.4  38  20.1 \nCement  146  212  45.0  54  24.2 \nPlastic Products  132  152  15.2  0  0.0 \nFuel  270  382  41.7  8  3.2 \nWeighted Average          100  47.6 \naBase year 1993\u20131994 = 100 \nSources: Reserve Bank of India and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Despite the price escalation rates of around 29\u201331%, the impact on the civil works cost \nwas limited to an increase of about 11%. Minimization of the impacts of the price escalation was \nachieved by shifting some contracts from ADB financing to the Government of India\u2019s special \ngrant programs and municipal corporations\u2019 own financing schemes. This reduced the total cost \nof  civil  works  contracts  for  ADB  financing.  For  example,  the  municipal  corporations,  in \nassociation with the project management unit, establish three financial sources for about 10 \ncontracts: \n \n(i)  Government grants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \n(JNNURM) to finance a large portion of works for the sewerage networks in \nIndore, \n(ii)  Government  grants  under  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Scheme  for \nSmall and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) to finance a large portion of works for the \nsewerage network and the sewage treatment plant in Gwalior, and \n(iii)  the municipal corporations\u2019 own budgets to finance some contracts for water \nsupply optimization in Gwalior and a large portion of works related to sanitary \nlandfill development in Bhopal.  \n ", " \n \nFFiigguurree  AA33..11::  EExxcchhaannggee   FFiigguurree  AA33..11::  EExxcchhaannggee  RRaatteess  aanndd  CCuummuullaattiivvee  CCoonnttrraacctt  AAwwaarrdd  AAmmoouunntt    \n \n50.0 180.0\n160.0\n140.0\nn\ne per $1  45.0 120.0 s: $ millio\ne d\nn rup 100.0 Awar\ns: India 80.0 ontract \ne C\nRat ve \nnge  40.0 60.0 ulati\na m\nxch Cu\nE\n40.0\n20.0\n35.0 0.0\nAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFeb\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nMonthly average Cumulative Contract Awards A\np\n  p\ne\n  nn\ndd\nSources: Reserve Bank of India and Yahoo Finance.  ixix\n   Contract awards source data is in the attachment to this appendix.   3 3\n  \n22\n99\n  \n ", " \nFigure A3.2: Price Indexes and Cumulative Contract Award Amount  3\n0\n   \n \n450 200 Ap\np\ne\nn\nd\n180 ix\n400  3\n \n160\nn)\no\n350 140 milli\n0) n \n10 $ i\n4 =  300 120 ds (\n3/9 war\n9 100 A\ne Index (19 250 80 e Contract \nPric 200 60 ativ\nu\nml\nu\n40 C\n150\n20\n100 0\nDate AprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDec\n2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08\nPrice Index of Steel Price Index of Cement\nPrice Index of Plastic Products Price Index of Fuel (Mineral Oils)\nWeighted Average of Steel, Cement, Plastic, and Fuel Cumulative Contract Awards\n \n \nSources: Reserve Bank of India. \n   Asian Development Bank estimates.

Background.  A  financial  analysis  of  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental \nImprovement  in  Madhya  Pradesh  Project  was  carried  out  for  the  revenue-generating \nsubprojects to confirm financial sustainability during the loan appraisal, and reported in the \nreport and recommendation of the President in 2003.1 The project aimed to improve generation \nof revenues from own sources, and to ensure that the operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nboth existing and new assets could be adequately covered. The original financial analysis \nassumed  timely  construction  of  urban  infrastructure,  and  implementation  of  the  financial \nimprovement action plan (FIAP), which was designed mainly to increase (i) a property tax, (ii) \nwater charges, (iii) sewerage surcharges, (iv) solid-waste management fees, and (v) property \ntax. \n \n2.  This revisited financial analysis will not propose any revisions in tariff and property tax \nrates  from  the  original  financial  analysis  in  2003. 2   Instead,  it  proposes  to  reschedule \nimplementation of the FIAP to reflect the delay in construction of urban infrastructure. Therefore, \nthe result of the original financial analysis remains the same, except for the financial cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis. This revisited financial analysis focuses on FIAP rescheduling and financial \ncost\u2013benefit analysis. \n \n3.  Progress of the Financial Improvement Action Plan. The FIAP was formulated with a \nphilosophy  that  people  would  not  accept  any  tariff  increase  unless  there  were  visible \nimprovements in urban services. It was envisaged that the start of major tariff increases would \nstart from the second year of project implementation, when some new urban infrastructure \nbecame operational. In reality, however, it was only in the second half of 2007 that the majority \nof contract works were awarded to the contractor. Although there has been good progress in \nimplementation  of  works,  major  infrastructure  is  still  under  construction  and  will  become \noperational  during  2009\u20132010.  Consequently,  the  start  of  FIAP  implementation  was  also \ndelayed, at least by 3 years. \n \n4.  Indore increased water tariffs in line with the FIAP in 2006. Jabalpur also increased \nwater tariff in 2006, but the extent of the increase was less than the FIAP. Ironically, however, \ntariff collection efficiency substantially dropped in both towns (from 40% to 9% in Indore, and \nfrom 46% to 41% in Jabalpur). There have been no major water tariff increases in Bhopal and \nGwalior, but tariff collection efficiency went up in Gwalior (from 25% to 61%). The introduction of \nsewerage surcharges and solid-waste management fees are still pending, as are revisions in \nthe property tax rates and assets valuation. The current FIAP implementation status implies \npolitical unwillingness to charge, and consumers\u2019 unwillingness to pay, until there are visible \nimprovements in urban services. \n \n5.  Rescheduling the Financial Improvement Action Plan. The implementation schedule \nof the FIAP was rescheduled to synchronize with the progress of physical investment and the \nreform agenda under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), in order to \nimplement the FIAP with the full understanding of the people of the municipal corporations. The \nrescheduled FIAP is presented in Table A8.4. In 2008 and 2009, while there will be no major \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nIndia for the Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project. Manila (Appendixes \n12 and 13). \n2  The target tariff and property tax rates in the original FIAP were found to be adequate despite the project \ncost increase. This was because there was some reduction in operation and maintenance (O&M) costs through the \nmunicipal corporations\u2019 effort in minimizing the energy costs. \n ", "48   Appendix 8 \ntariff increases, the tariff collection efficiency levels will be brought back to the 2005 level in \nIndore and Jabalpur. From 2010, while reducing the nonrevenue water and unaccounted-for \nwater, there will be substantial increases in collection efficiency and recovery of operation and \nmaintenance costs. Such increase will be made possible as (i) there will be visible improvement \nin urban services, and (ii) each municipal corporation will operate a new revenue management \nsystem, being developed under the Government of the United Kingdom\u2019s bilateral assistance.3 \nWhile the final target will be delayed by 1 year, there is no change in the final targets for the \nuser charges of various services from the original FIAP. The rescheduled FIAP represents \naverage  values  and  increase  in  rates.  This  will  be  translated  into  actual  tariff  table  by \nrestructuring tariffs as volumetric tariffs and incorporating equity consideration, such as lifeline \ntariffs. \n \nTable A8.1: Changes in Subproject Cost \n(Rs million) \n  Original  Bid Prices and  Variation \nVariation \nItem  Estimatesa Revised Estimatesa (%) \nBhopal         \nWater Supply    678.8    719.4    40.6    6 \nSewerage and Sanitationb   501.8    823.5    321.7    64 \nSolid Waste Managementb   124.5    37.2    (87.3)    (70) \nGwalior         \nWater Supply     767.5    995.6    228.1    30 \nSewerage, Drainage, and Sanitationb   739.6    325.3    (414.3)    (56) \nSolid Waste Managementb   77.8    1.9    (75.9)    (97) \nIndore         \nWater Supply  4,357.0    6,075.0    1,718.0    39 \nSewerage and Sanitationb   668.3    105.3    (563.0)    (84) \nSolid waste Management    139.1    153.1    14.0    10 \nJabalpur         \nWater Supply    932.0    1,868.3    936.3  100 \nSewerage, Drainage, and Sanitation    933.6    843.9    (89.7)    (10) \nSolid Waste Management    88.3    88.1    (0.2)    0 \na  Figures include contingencies and tax. For the cost\u2013benefit analysis, the estimated amount of tax was \nreduced from the figures. \nb  Due to shortage of the loan proceeds but urgent needs for the proposed urban infrastructure, some portions \nof works were fully financed by respective municipal corporations using their own sources and the Government of \nIndia\u2019s special funds. For the cost benefit analysis, however, the investment costs of the urban infrastructure fully \nfinanced by municipal corporations were incorporated. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the project management unit data. \n \n6.  Change in the Project Cost. The project cost in Indian rupee terms increased by Rs1.2 \nbillion (or by 8.8%) from Rs14 billion to Rs15 billion. The major cause of the increase in the \nproject cost was price escalation in civil works (11.5%). In an urban sector project, civil works \ngenerally require steel (for reinforced concrete and large pipes), cement (for construction and \npipes), plastic products (for pipes), and fuel (for operation of heavy machinery and freight). All \nmaterials experienced price escalation, yet the extent of increase varies from one material to \n                                                 \n3 Madhya Pradesh Urban Service for the Poor (MPUSP) is funded through a \u00a341 million grant from the Government \nof the United Kingdom for 5 years from 2006 to 2011. The ultimate objective of the MPUSP is increasing the urban \nlocal bodies\u2019 (ULB) capacity to deliver better services for the poor, through (i) setting up a participatory procedure \nfor improving slum communities, (ii) increasing the engineering capacity of the ULBs to design and implement slum \nimprovement activities, and (iii) strengthening the ULBs' financial capacity to invest more into slum improvement \nactivities and maintain urban services by enhancing the revenue through accounting reforms. The accounting \nreform will develop an accounting system which contains a revenue module linked with household data and a \ngeographic information system. This will help increase collection efficiency of user charges and taxes. \n ", "  Appendix 8  49\nanother. While the change in the overall works cost was about 11.5%, some contract works \nexperienced bigger price changes than others, as each work contract has different material \nrequirements. As such, the impact of price escalation varies from one contract to another. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  price  escalation.  Table  A8.1 \nsummarizes the changes in subproject costs. \n \n7.  Financial Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis. This financial analysis reassessed the sustainability \nof all revenue-generating subprojects, based on the revised cost estimates and the contract \nprices, and rescheduled FIAP in accordance with the Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects, ADB 2005.4 Financial analysis was conducted on a with-projects and without-projects \nbasis by estimating incremental costs and revenues over a 25-year period. The life of the newly \ncreated water infrastructure is 40 years. The base case compared the estimated financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) with the relevant weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to \ndetermine the financial viability of the revenue-generating subprojects. \n \n8.  Weighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital.  The  WACC  calculation  reflects  the  fund  flow \narrangement between the Government of India and the government of Madhya Pradesh.

Table A8.3 shows the summary \nresults of the financial analysis. \n \n10.  The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) in the base case are estimated at 3.0%\u2013\n12.9% for water supply subprojects, at 3.1%\u20134.7% for the sewerage subproject, and 6.4%\u2013\n18.5% for solid-waste management subprojects. The FIRRs are lower than the WACC for the \nwater supply subproject in Indore and sewerage subprojects in Bhopal and Indore. These \nsubprojects had comparatively lower FIRRs in the original financial analysis.  \n \n11.  The low FIRR for the water supply subproject in Indore is due to the higher cost of \ninvestment and operation associated with its hilly geography around the water source. The \noriginal design of the subproject was, however, the only least-cost option to supply water to \nIndore, and there were enormous social and political risks with the \"do-nothing option\". As such, \nthe government of Madhya Pradesh has provided the Indore municipal corporations with grants \nto offset a portion of the cost of investment. This reduced the WACC to approximately 3.1%. \nThe FIRR of the water supply subproject in Indore (3.5%) compares favorably with the revised \nWACC. Despite the low level of the FIRR, however, the water supply subproject in Indore will \ngenerate adequate revenue to sustain O&M. \n \n12.  For the sewerage subprojects in Bhopal and Indore with the low FIRR (3.4% in Bhopal \nand 3.5% in Indore), on the other hand, the revenue from the proposed tariffs are not sufficient \nto recover both capital and O&M cost, because (i) the investment cost is high due to deeper \nexcavation than water supply works, and (ii) there is a social and political inhibition to set \nsewerage  tariffs  higher  than  water  supply  tariffs.  Combined  FIRRs  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage are, however, all above the WACC. Despite the low level of the FIRR, the sewerage \nsubprojects in Bhopal and Indore will generate adequate revenue to sustain O&M. \n \n13.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the financial sustainability \nto changes in project parameters. The results indicate that the financial internal rates of return in \nall sectors are most sensitive to reduction in the incremental revenue. This suggests that, in \norder to realize higher financial returns, (i) the planned coverage of services needs to be \nachieved, and (ii) the rescheduled indicative FIAP needs to be implemented on time. \n \nTable A8.3: Revised Financial Internal Rate of Return \nItem  Bhopal  Gwalior  Indorea Jabalpur \nWater Supply         \nBase case         \nFIRR (%)    9.9    12.9    3.5  8.8 \nNPV (Rs million)    1,559.5    1,191.3    288.4  1,119.8 \nCapital cost increase by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    9.6    11.8    2.8  7.9 \nSwitching value (%)    296.0    115.0    51.0  96.0 \nO&M costs increased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    9.6    12.7    2.4  8.5 \nSwitching value (%)    308.0    593.0    31.0  286.0 \nIncremental revenue decreased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    8.6    11.5    1.8  7.5 \nSwitching value (%)    75.0    93.0    20.0  71.0 \n1-year delay in service         \nFIRR (%)    8.5    11.2    2.3  7.6 \nSewerage         \nBase case         \nFIRR (%)    3.4    3.8    3.5  4.7 \nNPV (Rs million)    (35.9)    (4.4)    33.8  88.7 \n ", "  Appendix 8  51\nItem  Bhopal  Gwalior  Indorea Jabalpur \nCapital cost increase by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    2.8    3.1    2.9  4.0 \nSwitching value (%)    54.0    56.0    56.0  67.0 \nO&M costs increased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    3.1    3.3    3.1  4.6 \nSwitching value (%)    94.0    80.0    77.0  323.0 \nIncremental revenue decreased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    2.5    2.7    2.6  3.9 \nSwitching value (%)    38.0    36.0    36.0  61.0 \n1-year delay in service         \nFIRR (%)    2.8    3.0    2.8  4.1 \nWater Supply and Sewerage         \nBase case         \nFIRR (%)    8.5    9.6    3.5  8.8 \nNPV (Rs million)    1,648.5    1,173.1    322.1  1,119.8 \nCapital cost increase by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    8.0    8.6    2.8  7.9 \nSwitching value (%)    182.0    103.0    51.0  96.0 \nO&M costs increased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    8.1    9.3    2.5  8.5 \nSwitching value (%)    252.0    313.0    33.0  286.0 \nIncremental revenue decreased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    7.3    8.3    1.9  7.5 \nSwitching value (%)    70.0    75.0    21.0  71.0 \n1- year delay in service         \nFIRR (%)    7.3    8.3    2.4  7.6 \nSolid Waste Management         \nBase case         \nFIRR (%)    6.4    7.7    18.5  8.7 \nNPV (Rs million)    26.9    35.0    266.3  33.5 \nCapital cost increase by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    4.5    6.2    16.7  7.1 \nSwitching value (%)    33.0    53.0    105.0  53.0 \nO&M costs increased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    4.5    6.3    17.3    6.8 \nSwitching value (%)    34.0    55.0    148.0    46.0 \nIncremental revenue decreased by 10%         \nFIRR (%)    2.0    4.8    15.3    4.7 \nSwitching value (%)    15.0    27.0    5.0    22.0 \n1- year delay in service         \nFIRR (%)    3.6    5.5    14.2    5.7 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, NRW = nonrevenue water, O&M = operation and \nmaintenance. \na  The government of Madhya Pradesh has provided the Indore municipal corporations with grants to offset a \nportion of the cost of investment.

Background. An economic analysis of the Urban Water Supply and Environmental \nImprovement in Madhya Pradesh Project was carried out to confirm economic viability during \nthe loan appraisal, and reported in the report and recommendation of the President in 2003.1 \nThe proposed supplementary loan is to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation and \nprice escalation, and there is no variation in the project scope and the benefit levels. Therefore, \nthe result of the original economic analysis remains the same, except for the economic cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis. This revisited economic analysis focuses on economic cost\u2013benefit analysis, \nusing the same approach as was used in the original economic analysis. \n \n2.  Change in the Project Cost. The project cost in Indian rupee terms increased by Rs1.2 \nbillion (or by 8.8%) from Rs14 billion to Rs15 billion. The major cause of the increase in the \nproject cost was price escalation in civil works (11.5%). In an urban sector project, civil works \ngenerally require steel (for reinforced concrete and large pipes), cement (for construction and \npipes), plastic products (for pipes), and fuel (for operation of heavy machinery and freight). All \nmaterials experienced price escalation, yet the extent of increase varies from one material to \nanother. While the change in the overall works cost was about 11.5%, some contract works \nexperienced  bigger  price  changes  than  others.  Each  work  contract  has  different  material \nrequirements. As such, the impact of price escalation varies from one contract to another. \nAppendix  3  provides  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  impact  of  price  escalation.

Manila (Appendix 11). \n ", "54   Appendix 9 \n \n3.  Economic Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis. In order to assess the economic efficiency of project \ninvestments, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) in 25 years has been estimated. The \nshadow exchange rate factor2 was updated, but shadow wage rate3 used in the original \neconomic analysis was applied. \n \n4.  Economic Costs. There are two types of costs: (i) capital investment,4 and (ii) operation \nand maintenance. The economic cost of the investment is converted from the financial cost. The \noperation and maintenance cost includes updated energy cost, chemicals, salaries, and repair \nand maintenance. \n \n5.  Economic Benefits. Economic benefit of water supply subprojects consist of (i) savings \naccrued by replacing existing water sources with piped household connections,5 and (ii) value of \nwater which consumers are willing to pay6 for additional consumption as a result of greater \navailability of water. The benefits of improved sewerage and sanitation are primarily public \nhealth and environmental improvement. As these benefits are reflected in the willingness to pay, \nthe economic benefit of sewerage and sanitation subprojects are valued using the willingness to \npay of residential households and businesses.7 Similarly, the economic benefits of solid waste \nmanagement projects were estimated using the willingness to pay of residential households and \nbusinesses.8 The willing to pay figures used in the revised analysis are the same as those in the \noriginal economic analysis in 2003 due to lack of updated data, and therefore the analysis is a \nconservative estimate. \n \n6.  Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital. Given the complexity of estimating country-\nspecific  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  a  discount  rate  of  12%  in  constant \neconomic prices is generally used as a proxy for EOCC in the economic analysis of ADB-\nfinanced projects.9 The benefit is measured by willingness to pay in the original analysis. The \nlevel of benefit is most likely underestimated, because the respondents of the willingness to pay \nsurvey might not aware of the all kinds of potential benefit, and therefore were not able to reflect \nthe value of all benefits but only the perceived immediate benefit. As significant unquantifiable \nnet benefits are believed to be likely, all EIRRs are likely to be substantially underestimated. In \n                                                 \n2  The standard conversion factor used was 0.85, which was equal to the shadow exchange rate factor of 1.17. No \nbackground information was provided in the original economic analysis worksheets. The revised shadow exchange \nrate factor using the external trade data was 1.06. \n3  The shadow wage rates were 0.75 for skilled labor and 0.98 for unskilled labor. No background information was \nprovided in the original economic analysis worksheets. \n4  For large urban infrastructure, 40 years of life was assumed and the residual values were taken into consideration \nin the 25th year. For equipment and landfill sites, 10 years of life is assumed, and the same amount of the cost is \nincurred every 10 years during the analysis period. \n5  The resource cost saving was estimated at Rs22.6 per cubic meter in the original economic analysis in 2003 \nbased on the findings from the project preparatory technical assistance. \n6  Willingness to pay was estimated through a survey during the project preparatory technical assistance. According \nto the original economic analysis, the value was underestimated by the respondents of the survey, since the \nincremental benefit of providing enough water to avoid a water crisis and ensure economic survival was much higher \nthan was reflected by the simple willingness to pay revealed by individual households. \n7  The willingness to pay of a residential household is Rs76 per month in Bhopal, Rs61 in Gwalior, Rs69 in Indore, \nand Rs61 Jabalpur; the willingness to pay of a business is Rs238 per month in Bhopal, Rs126 in Gwalior, Rs273 in \nIndore, and Rs85 in Jabalpur.  \n8  The willingness to pay of a residential household is Rs16 per month in Bhopal, Rs11 in Gwalior, Rs17 in Indore, \nand Rs13 in Jabalpur; and the willingness to pay of a business is Rs71 per month in Bhopal, Rs31 in Gwalior, Rs42 \nin Indore, and Rs52 in Jabalpur. \n9   ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 9  55\ncase of the water supply subproject in Indore (EIRR of 10%),10 not only will there be substantial \nunderestimation of the EIRR, but also, a \"do-nothing option\" will cause increasing economic \ncost of water supply shortage.11 Considering the enormous social and political risks of the do-\nnothing option in Indore, and lack of alternative approaches to the problems, there are few \nequivalent potential investment activities for the given capital. \n \n7.  Conclusion. As Table A9.2 shows, all subprojects are economically viable, in spite of \nthe cost increase, with the estimated EIRR values exceeding the EOCC in all cases. The EIRR \nof most of the subprojects are lower than the original estimates. However, some subprojects are \nhigher than in the original economic analysis because the detail engineering design\u2019s cost \nestimates of some subprojects became less than the feasibility study estimates as the result of \nefforts of the municipal corporations, and the operation and maintenance cost became less than \nwhat was originally envisaged. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the \neconomic results to changes in project parameters. The results indicate that the EIRRs are \nsensitive to a 1-year delay in realization of the economic benefits in some subprojects and \nreduction in beneficiary levels in other subprojects. This suggests that, in order to realize higher \neconomic benefits, (i) timely completion of works and smooth transition to operation are crucial, \nand (ii) the planned coverage of services needs to be achieved. \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002.
