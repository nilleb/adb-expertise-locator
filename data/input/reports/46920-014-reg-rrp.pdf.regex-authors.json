THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nSupply Chain Finance Program of up to $200,000,000\u2014or its equivalent in local currency \nacceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2014under  which  guarantees  to  and  debt \nfinancing through partner financial institutions (PFIs) would be extended to provide working \ncapital to developing member country (DMC) companies.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Availability of reliable financial services to facilitate trade plays a vital role in trade-driven \neconomic growth and poverty alleviation. Two such services are trade finance and supply chain \nfinance (SCF). To respond to the high but unmet demand for these services, ADB established \nthe Trade Finance Program2 (TFP), which provides guarantees and loans to banks to facilitate \ncross-border trade, and is now seeking to set up a program that would supply guarantees and \nfunding for domestic and international SCF transactions. The program aims to broaden access \nto  working  capital for DMC  companies,  and thereby facilitate  business  expansion  and  job \ncreation, the ultimate drivers of economic growth and poverty alleviation. \n \n3.  There are three primary participants in a supply chain of producing and distributing \ngoods: (i) an \u2015anchor\u2016, which may act as either a buyer or a seller of manufactured goods and is \ntypically a large corporate entity; (ii) a supplier, which produces and ships manufactured goods \nto  the  anchor;  and (iii)  a  distributor,  which  buys  manufactured goods from  the  anchor for \nonselling to retailers.  Under the program, it is anticipated that most (but not all) anchors will be \ndomiciled in a developed country and that most suppliers and distributors will be small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) located in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n4.  There are three main SCF products: (i) post-shipment or post-acceptance finance, in \nwhich  the  supplier  ships  goods  that  are  accepted  by  the  corporate  anchor,  who  in  turn \nacknowledges its obligation to pay by a specific date, at which point a financial institution pays \nthe supplier, followed by direct payment by the anchor to the financial institution on the specified \nfuture date; (ii) pre-shipment or pre-acceptance finance, where financing is provided before \ngoods are accepted by the anchor, and in some cases even before shipment takes place; and \n(iii) distributor finance, where financing for downstream distributors is provided to cover the \nbusiness cycle, or the time it takes the distributor to sell and be paid for goods purchased from \nan anchor. The following diagram illustrates a basic supply chain. A description of each product \nand attendant risk parameters is in Supply Chain Finance Products and Their Risk Parameters.3 \nAlso see Diagram of Post-Shipment or Post-Acceptance Supply Chain Finance Program on how \npost-shipment or post-acceptance SCF works.4 \n \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2012.

Unlike the advanced \u2015just-in-time\u2016 efficiencies obtained in the physical supply chain from \n1990-2012, the financial supply chain still is primarily a manual, non-integrated, and inefficient \nprocess. Under the current system, cash flow for working capital is trapped in the supply chain, \ninhibiting the ability of DMC companies to expand and create more jobs. For example, having to \nwait 30\u2013180 days post-shipment for payment may mean having to shut down operations and \ndelaying the processing (or acquisition) of other contracts in the meantime.  Receiving cash flow \neven just 30 days earlier could make a substantial difference\u2014DMC companies would have a \nsteady  flow  of  working  capital  to  maintain  production  capacity,  retain  staff,  and  ultimately \nexpand operations and employ more people. \n \n6.  This suboptimal financial supply chain has been exacerbated by the ongoing global \neconomic downturn. Tighter credit conditions have resulted in anchors putting more and more \npressure on suppliers to extend payment terms and distributors to shorten payment terms, \nwhich in turn has made business expansion exceedingly difficult or impossible. Razor-thin \nmargins  also make  it  harder  to  accommodate further  requests to  extend  payment terms.5  \nWithout  better  access  to  working  capital,  suppliers  and  buyers  are  at  risk  of  losing  trade \ncontracts, and generally have less cash flow available to expand operations and create jobs.  \n \n7.  The program aims to offer an efficient means of managing financial supply chains that \nwould improve access to affordable working capital, and in some cases provide access to \nfinance for companies in DMCs that would otherwise not be considered \u2015bankable\u2016. One of the \nkey features of the program, at least as it relates to post-shipment or post-acceptance finance, \nis that trade receivables are discounted based on the anchor\u2019s credit rating, as opposed to the \nsupplier\u2019s. For this reason, the program can provide DMC suppliers with a cheaper source of \nworking capital, and earlier than would otherwise be the case. \n \n8.  SCF is a relatively new trade service and few providers of such services are in the \nmarket. The scarcity of market participants is further compounded by the limited scope of their \nSCF  programs,  mainly  due  to  (i)  tight  capital  positions\u2014the  result  of  deleveraging,  more \nstringent regulatory requirements, and higher capital requirements for banks; (ii) slow uptake of \nthe  new  approach  to  assessing  risk,  which  focuses  on  the  strength  of  a  supply  chain \n                                                \n5  Demica. 2009. Strengthening the Links: Supply Chain Finance. London. (April). ", "  3 \nrelationship (i.e., supplier\u2013anchor, anchor\u2013distributor) rather than financials and collateral; and \n(iii) high costs of developing information technology (IT) infrastructure to support SCF services. \n \n9.  The program aims to boost PFIs\u2019 capital and risk-bearing capacity, thereby furthering \ntheir ability to be more active in providing SCF to suppliers and distributors in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The \nprogram would provide additional resources for SCF to support DMC companies. The TFP is \nincreasingly called on to provide more support to fill widening financing gaps. To support job \ncreation in DMCs and, ultimately, sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in DMCs, \nit is important that ADB now lend its capacity to filling market gaps for SCF. The program will \nenable ADB to unlock financial resources caught in the supply chain. These resources will \nsupport domestic and cross-border transactions for the benefit of private sector development, \nSMEs, and job creation. \n \nB.  Program Description \n10.  This will be ADB\u2019s first SCF program. It entails the provision of guarantees to and debt \nfinancing (both without a government guarantee) through PFIs to support payments throughout \nthe supply chain, and will (i) enable companies traditionally not deemed bankable to receive \nfinance, (ii) improve cash flow to enable growth and job creation, and (iii) encourage more \nfinancial institutions to develop and broaden SCF. \n \n11.  ADB will provide partial guarantees to and debt financing through PFIs that offer SCF to \nsuppliers and distributors in ADB's DMCs of up to $200,000,000 at any time. Such financing \nsupport will be on a rolling basis. Guarantees would be provided to PFIs and cover the risk of \nnonpayment by an obligor, which may be a supplier, a distributor, or an anchor. Therefore, \nunder these guarantees, ADB\u2019s payment obligations will arise upon nonpayment of the supplier, \nanchor, or distributor obligation. Under the proposed debt-financing arrangements, ADB will \nadvance short-term loans through PFIs to DMC suppliers and distributors. These loans will be \nmatched in equal or greater amounts by the PFI to the same borrower. A payment default to the \nPFI would give rise to a pass-through nonpayment of ADB\u2019s debt service. ADB would rely on \nthe  recovery  process  of  the  PFI  for  recourse  against  any  defaulting  party.  Any  amounts \nrecovered would be shared on a pro rata basis. In contrast to the TFP, ADB will not take credit \nrisk on the PFI, but on the parties to the underlying supply transactions. \n \n12.  Different  FIs  have  different  SCF  product  capabilities,  largely  distinguished  by  an \nindividual FI\u2019s risk appetite, presence in DMCs, and monitoring capabilities. ADB will select \nsuitable PFIs and determine which SCF products would be appropriate for ADB participation \nwith a particular PFI. Assessment of an individual PFI\u2019s suitability per SCF product will largely \nbe based on its alignment with eligibility criteria for SCF products provided in Supply Chain \nFinance Products and Their Risk Parameters (footnote 3) and on the PFI\u2019s capability to assess \nand monitor transactions under a particular SCF product portfolio. The scope of the program\u2019s \nengagement with a PFI will be tailored to that PFI\u2019s capabilities. \n \n13.  The program will be regional and aims to encompass as many DMCs as possible, \nincluding those benefiting from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. However, it should \nbe noted that most SCF flows occur in the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Sri \nLanka, and Viet Nam. While ADB will make every effort to diversify its geographic exposure and \nsupport, the program will nonetheless be linked to where PFIs have SCF exposure. \n \n14.  A related technical assistance (TA) to the program may be proposed to develop ADF \nDMC markets for more SCF engagement. DMC companies have limited familiarity with SCF \n ", "4    \nand its IT requirements, and an SCF TA targeted to ADF DMC companies may be important to \nenable geographic diversification of the program. Rather than implementing related TA at this \npoint, it would be more prudent to do so after some experience in operating the program, which \nwill allow better tailoring and targeting of any TA. \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n15.  A survey of over 20 banks and due diligence for this program confirmed unmet demand \nfor SCF and requests for ADB partnership to help fill the gap. There are no specific figures \nquantifying the gap, but the anecdotal evidence is compelling.  Requests from potential PFIs \nexceed the proposed $200,000,000 program amount by more than three times. \n \n16.  The program will further ADB\u2019s ability to support private sector growth, especially among \nDMC companies and more particularly SMEs. ADB has made substantial progress in supporting \ntrade through the TFP, but this is limited to assuming bank risk for cross-border transactions. \nThe program will complement the TFP by assuming nonbank commercial risks for both cross-\nborder and domestic transactions.6 \n \n17.  Strategically, the two programs are an excellent fit, being complementary but distinct. \nADB has no experience in SCF and, while it is an excellent strategic and \u2015developmental\u2016 \ncomplement to the TFP, SCF risk is considerably different. ADB does not yet have the expertise \nor human resources to provide the significant TA and monitoring that would be required to \nsupport the start-up of a commercial bank\u2019s SCF program. Therefore, it is proposed that ADB \nenter this market prudently, extending its involvement over time as its knowledge, expertise, and \nexperience in SCF become substantial. Furthermore, it is proposed that the program initially \nprovide support through PFIs that already have well-established SCF portfolios. ADB should try \nto start with the post-acceptance SCF product before moving into other products. Moreover, the \nprogram would benefit from the experience and relationships that ADB developed through the \nTFP, and SCF partnerships should be structured along similar lines. \n \n18.  During the program, ADB will evaluate whether changes to the structure and other \nparameters should be contemplated to ensure maximum development impact and success. \nComplementary TA will also be considered during the review, if not sooner. \n  \nD.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n19.  ADB will seek to include in the program as many PFIs as practicable. Prospective PFIs \nwill be evaluated based on high standards of corporate governance and integrity, management \ncaliber, financial soundness, and operational capability. ADB will take into consideration the \nquality of the prospective PFI\u2019s existing SCF portfolio as well as its procedures for assessing \nand mitigating risk (including environmental and social risk) and such policies and procedures \nas pertain to due diligence and evaluation of suppliers, anchors, and distributors. \n \n20.  While ADB will not assume credit risk on PFIs, it will assume some operational risk on \nPFIs and will therefore consider their overall credit standing, which takes account of operational \nand due diligence capabilities. As such, ADB will target PFIs with international or local ratings of \n                                                \n6  Comparison Between Trade Finance Program and Supply Chain Finance Program (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) ", "  5 \nA\u2013 or better.7 Eligible PFIs will be approved by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee, which will take \ninto consideration all parameters mentioned above. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n \n21.  Under the program, ADB will provide guarantees to and debt financing through PFIs that \noffer  SCF  to  suppliers  and  distributors  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  It  is  proposed  that  the  program \nterminate after 5 years and that, in any case, all ADB\u2019s obligations and liabilities under the \nprogram be discharged by 31 August 2018. Financing of all forms under the program will not  \nexceed $200,000,000 at any time and will be provided on a rolling basis. PFIs will assume at \nleast an equal amount of risk to ADB under the program. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will administer the program along the lines that are \nalready familiar under the TFP. PFIs will be required to provide ADB with regular, at least \nquarterly, information about its SCF portfolio, including beneficiaries, country exposures and \nconcentrations, as well as reporting on any delinquent payments. PFIs will also be required to \nprovide ADB with statistics to assess the development impact. ADB will review this information \nand monitor the program continuously. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  Value proposition and imperative. SCF is a unique and important vehicle through \nwhich to support DMC companies, and holds potential for significant development impact. SCF \novercomes the two greatest impediments to financial support for DMC companies, including \nSMEs: weak financials and lack of collateral. Unlike standard risk assessments that focus on \ncredit assessment and collateral, SCF risk assessment focuses on the strength, longevity, and \n\u2015stickiness\u2016  (mutual  dependence)  of  relationships  in  a  supply  chain.  It  is  the  relationship \nbetween  an  anchor  and  a  supplier  (usually  a  DMC  SME)  that  is  of  primary  concern,  not \nfinancials and collateral. SCF represents a somewhat revolutionary paradigm through which \nADB can support SMEs not normally considered \u2015bankable\u2016. \n \n24.  Another major value of SCF is that it provides the cash flow required for companies to \ngrow and create more jobs. Suppliers may have enough working capital to produce goods for \none or two shipments, but then need to scale down operations until they receive payment from \nan anchor, typically between 30 and 180 days after shipment. SCF provides cash to suppliers \nearlier, allowing them to fill multiple contracts at the same time and thereby enabling them to \ngrow  their  business,  which  requires  more  staff.  As  such,  SCF  can  become  an  important \nmechanism to underpin economic growth and job creation. \n \n25.  Capital resources are tight for many financial institutions, resulting in fewer financial \nresources to support DMC companies, especially SMEs. Less leverage (which is the \u2015new \nnormal\u2016), more stringent regulatory requirements, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and \npressure to hold more capital are all contributing to these conditions. When capital is tight, \nfinancial institutions focus on core products for core clients (not DMC companies and SMEs) in \nprimary markets (which most DMCs are not). It is here that the program will provide additional \n                                                \n7  Financial, including nonbank, institutions that are rated below A\u2013 may still be eligible if they broadly meet ADB\u2019s \nother requirements as a potential PFI. If no international or local rating is available, ADB may assign one. \n ", "6    \nsupport to DMC companies. PFIs will use ADB resources to leverage their own to support more \nSCF activity in DMCs. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s strong credit standing\u2014AAA-rated guarantees lower \nthe financial institutions' risk-weighted assets against capital requirements\u2014makes it a highly \ndesirable  partner  for  financial  institutions  with  SCF  skills  and  existing  portfolios,  and  high \ndemand for the program is anticipated. The TFP is increasingly called on to provide more \nsupport to fill widening gaps. Likewise, ADB could lend its capacity to support supply chain \nfinancing, a new area with significant potential to support economic growth and jobs in DMCs. \n \n26.  Value added. Capital alleviation and risk sharing from ADB under the program will boost \nthe risk-bearing capacity of PFIs and make more funds available for SCF, to the benefit of more \nDMC companies, particularly SMEs. To ensure additionality, the potential PFIs that ADB has so \nfar approached have indicated their willingness (as a condition for participating in the program) \nto agree to an SCF baseline with targeted annual increases in the number of DMC companies \nthat will access SCF. ADB will thus ensure that (i) the program serves to benefit parties that \nwould otherwise not be part of a PFI\u2019s standard SCF portfolio, and (ii) the PFIs themselves \ncommit to a formal policy of expanding their SCF portfolios. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n27.  The program entails the provision of guarantees and debt financing through PFIs to \nsupport payments throughout the supply chain, and thus will assume risk on anchors, DMC \nsuppliers, and DMC distributors. In all cases under the program, a PFI\u2019s risk will be at least \nequal to ADB\u2019s. \n \n28.  SCF is a relatively low-risk way to support SMEs and other DMC companies. There are \nthree primary reasons for this:  (i) Unlike conventional risk assessments focused on financials \nand collateral, which provide a narrow and relatively limited or isolated assessment of risk, SCF \ntakes a \u2015holistic\u2016 approach, providing a broader perspective on the history and future of a DMC \ncompany\u2019s (SME\u2019s) ability to perform and meet obligations based on its continuing performance \nin supplying to anchors. (ii) Unlike financial statement analysis (which reports after the fact), \nSCF risk monitoring can be pre-emptive. Quarterly and annual discussions with suppliers and \nanchors can inform a PFI of warning signs, such as an anticipated slow-down in orders or \nvarious performance issues. Traditional risk assessments focused on statements would not \nrecognize these issues until it might be too late to exit or restructure. (iii) In the case of \ndistributor finance, the anchor and the PFI agree to a \u2015stop supply\u2016 clause; this gives the PFI the \nright to stop an anchor from selling goods to a distributor in the event of nonpayment and \nprovides a substantial disincentive to avoid meeting obligations, since distributors would go out \nof business without supply from the anchor. \n \n29.  The degree of risk under an SCF transaction depends on when support is provided in \nthe  supply  chain.  For  example,  if  a  financial  institution  provides  post-shipment  and  post-\nacceptance finance, its risk on the supplier is negligible. If, however, it extends financing before \nshipment, it assumes both a supplier and an anchor risk. \n \n30.  The list of risks associated with each SCF product, and eligibility criteria that will broadly \nbe required for ADB support, is in Supply Chain Finance Products and Their Risk Parameters \n(footnote 3). \n \n31.  PFIs will be responsible for recoveries under any defaults. All recoveries will be shared \nwith ADB on a pro-rata basis. ", "  7 \n \n32.  Program Risks contains a detailed list of risks.8 \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n33.  The ultimate development impact of the program will be broader access to SCF, in that \nthe number of DMC companies with access to supply chain financing increases by at least 25% \nby 2020, compared with the 2012 industry baseline, which is expected to serve as a catalyst for \ntrade-related economic growth in developing Asia. \n \n2.  Outcome \n34.  The outcome of the program will be a broadening of PFIs\u2019 SCF portfolios with the \nprovision of up to $500,000,000 (ADB\u2019s participation: $200,000,000) in SCF on a rolling basis to \nDMC companies between 2013 and 2018. \n \n3.  Outputs \n 35.  The key output will be the establishment of ADB\u2019s SCF program for the purpose of \nimproving  DMC  companies'  access  to  working  capital.  Related  output  indicators  include \nenrollment  of four  PFIs  by  2015,  and  a  15% increase  in the number  of  DMC  companies \nsupported by PFI supply chain financing by 2017. The potential PFIs that ADB has thus far \napproached have indicated their willingness (as a condition of participating in the program) to \nagree to an SCF baseline with targeted annual increases in the number of DMC companies that \nwill access supply chain financing. Baseline and target figures will be finalized when signing the \nagreements with PFIs. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n36.  Under  Strategy  2020,  ADB  will  strengthen  its  support  to  the  finance  sector,  both \nregionally and nationally, by helping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products \nand services, and by promoting inclusive growth.9 Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to \nassist in channeling the region's savings into the most productive investments, and to build the \ncapacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The  proposed \ninvestment  supports  institutional  development  and  helps  deepen  the  finance  sector  by \nexpanding financial resources to support SMEs, economic growth, and job creation. It will also \nhave a demonstration effect on non-partner financial institutions that are not yet providing SCF. \n   \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n37.  Supporting finance sector development is a key focus of development assistance for \nADB, in line with the tenets detailed in its strategies for private sector development10 and poverty \n                                                \n8  Program Risks (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n9  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n10 ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n ", "8    \nreduction.11. The latter states that ADB seeks to promote \u2015sound and efficient banking systems \nand  capital  markets,\u2016  since  these  are seen  as  \u2015indispensable for  macroeconomic stability, \nmobilizing savings, and ensuring the availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement \nfor pro-poor growth\u2016 (footnote 11). The Private Sector Development Strategy refers specifically \nto ADB's role in strengthening the finance sector for the benefit of DMCs. Thus, this program is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s overall finance sector strategy, as it will assist the development of a \ncritical component of the sector\u2019s much-needed support for SMEs in DMCs. \n \n38.  The program will be aligned with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, especially for \nfinancial inclusion,12 and enable ADB to provide support to SMEs not traditionally considered \n\u2015bankable\u2016.  While the TFP fills a market gap, its reach is limited to supporting transactions that \ninvolve bank risk. The program, which assumes nonbank risk, will complement the TFP by \nrounding off ADB\u2019s range of products in support of DMC companies' domestic and cross-border \ntransactions. The program also exemplifies ADB\u2019s holistic approach to creating private sector \neconomic  growth  and  job  creation.  ADB  will  leverage  off  its  success  in  structuring  and \nimplementing the TFP to apply lessons learned to the program. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n39.  The proposed investment is classified as FI (treated as category C) for environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The program will involve primarily guarantees and debt financing of small loans for \ntransactions in a supply chain each with insignificant environmental impact. The project team \nwill review prospective PFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems. It is recognized \nthat certain industry sectors such as garments, which may be supported under the program, \nmay pose heightened environmental risks. ADB will ensure during due diligence that such risks \nare properly assessed and managed by potential PFIs. The project team will also review and \nassess potential gender benefits of the program, which could be quite positive and relevant, \nespecially as the garment sector is likely to feature prominently in the program. Furthermore, the \nfeasibility of prospective PFIs' mechanisms to monitor compliance with national labor laws and \ninternationally recognized labor standards will be an important consideration when selecting \nPFIs.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  Each PFI would be advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice in \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  financing  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n41.  The proposed program is within the country, industry, group, and single investment \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2004.

Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),13 the government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance will be obtained from any \ngovernment within whose territory financing under the program will be provided.

RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed Supply Chain Finance Program of up to $200,000,000 \n(or its equivalent in local currency acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB)), would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of Asian Development Bank and recommend that the \nBoard  approve  the  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n18 October 2012 \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1966.
