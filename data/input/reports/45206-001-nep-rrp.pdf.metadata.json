This will contribute significantly \nto  improving  implementation  performance  of  the  ensuing  projects  by  reducing  the  gap  from \nproject  approval  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \ncommencement  of  improvement  works,  helping  to  achieve  the  intended  outcomes  efficiently \nand realizing their impact and benefits quickly.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNepal,  largely  an  agrarian  economy,  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  climate  and \navailability  of  natural  resources  including  water.3  While  water  resources  face  additional \ndemands  with  the  increasing  amount  of  water  required  for  energy  and  urban  use  to  support \ncontinuing economic growth, irrigation still accounts for 87% of water use and water remains the \nmost critical input for food security. Most opportunities to improve agricultural production  and, \nthus,  reduce  poverty  and  food  deficiencies  depend  on  improved  infrastructure  for  water \nresources,  improved  management  of  the  infrastructure,  improved  water  use  efficiency,  and \nprotection  of  crops  and  infrastructure  from  water-induced  disasters  such  as  floods,  landslides, \nand land erosion. \n \nClimate change threatens to reduce the effectiveness of development initiatives across \n4. \nNepal. In some regions, increasing drought will impair food security and affect the availability of \nwater resources; while in others, increases in the intensity of rains will cause increased flooding \nand landslide risks threatening human security, water supplies, and infrastructure. In the hill and \nmountain regions in particular (accounting for two-thirds of the land area), reduced food security \nresults in the increasing use of more and more marginal land for food production. This, in turn, \nresults in increasing environmental instability in the fragile mountain ecological system through \naccelerated soil erosion and increased runoff during the monsoon season. On the other hand, \naccess  to  water  for  irrigation  allows  intensive  food  crop  cultivation  on  higher  quality,  more \nproductive  land,  thus  increasing  overall  food  production  and  forestalling  environmental \ndegradation of less-productive marginal areas. The preparation of readily implementable water \nresource projects to address these issues is thus crucial for the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus and \nfor climate-resilient food security and environmental sustainability. \n \n5. \nThe  provision  of  adequate  water  through  supplementary  irrigation  can  double  or  triple \ncrop  yields  in  the  monsoon  season,  and  dry  season  irrigation  can  produce  crops  when  none \ncould be grown before. The combination of effective and efficient land and water use can thus \nhave  a  major  impact  on  food  security  and  environmental  stability.  To  this  effect,  since  the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The facility was prepared without project preparatory technical assistance. In 2010, ADB approved a similar project \npreparatory facility for the transport sector. ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Grant to Nepal for the Transport Project Preparatory Facility. Manila. \n\n3  Government of Nepal, Ministry of the Environment. 2010. National Adaptation Programme for Action. Kathmandu. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nimproved  system  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M), \n\n1980s, Nepal has significantly increased rural livelihoods through investment in water resource \ninfrastructure,  improved  agriculture  technology  and  extension  services,  and  enhanced  rural \naccess. However, at present, only 38% of the irrigated area is provided with irrigation water on a \nyear-round basis and not all of this is used efficiently. On the other hand, during years of intense \nrainfall, both crops and infrastructure are likely to be damaged by catastrophic floods and fertile \nsoils can be washed away. As a consequence, almost half of the districts, particularly from the \nhill  and  mountains  of  the  far-western,  mid-western,  and  eastern  development  regions,  are  still \nfood deficient. \n \n6. \nNepal\u2019s  population  continues  to  grow  and,  with  the  current  growth  rate,  is  expected  to \nreach 38 million (from about 24 million) by 2025. This means that, for the country to remain food \nsufficient  and  avoid  serious  environmental  degradation  as  a  result  of  unstable  cultivation \npractices,  agricultural  production  will  have  to  continue  growing,  particularly  in  irrigated  areas. \nIndeed,  the  provision  of  year-round  irrigation,  both  as  supplementary  irrigation  during  the \nmonsoon season and full irrigation during the dry season, is crucial to achieve the full potential \nof  the  agriculture  resources,  ensure  the  efficient  use  of  land  and  water,  and  prevent  food \ninsecurity and further environmental deterioration. Further, with irrigation, the risk of crop failure \nis mitigated and farmers are provided with an incentive to invest in more productive farming and \nhigh-value  crops,  thus  increasing  the  efficient  and  effective  use  of  land  and  water  resources. \nHowever,  the  provision  of  physical  infrastructure  on  its  own  is  not  enough  to  ensure  efficient \nland  and  water  use.  For  irrigation  to  have  its  full  potential  impact,  irrigation  facilities  must  be \ncomplemented  with  improved  water  distribution  and  management,  strengthened  water  user \nassociations, \nfarming \ntechnologies  and  marketing,  and  increased  protection  from  catastrophic  floods  during  the \nmonsoon season. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  2005  National  Water  Plan  (NWP)4  aims  to  increase  the  area  of \n7. \nirrigable land provided with irrigation facilities from the current 65% to 97% by 2027, an increase \nin year-round irrigation coverage from the current 38% of irrigated area to 67%, and an average \ncropping intensity increase within year-round irrigated areas from the current 140% to 193%. It \nalso  aims  to  put  in  place  infrastructure  to  mitigate  predictable  water-induced  disasters  in  \n20  districts  and  to  establish  functional  water-induced  disaster  warning  systems  throughout \nNepal  by  2017.  An  important  facet  of  the  NWP  is  its  emphasis  on  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement, which is recognized as a key principle governing water and energy development. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Nepal5  proposes  that  ADB  and  the \n8. \ngovernment  explore  interventions  to  improve  food  security  including  supporting  greater \navailability  of  water  and  year-round  irrigation  to  help  mitigate  recent  erratic  rainfall  patterns.  It \nnotes  that  ADB  will  (i)  introduce  disaster  screening  into  its  operations  in  Nepal  to  ensure  that \nnew  investments  factor  in  disaster  risks,  and  maximize  mitigation  measures;  (ii)  assist  the \ngovernment in strengthening the capacity of agencies for managing disaster risks; and (iii) help \nthe  government  implement  ongoing  flood  damage  rehabilitation.  The  agriculture  and  natural \nresources  sector  road  map  for  the  CPS  further  notes  that  improved  access  to  year-round \nirrigation  would  enable  crop  diversification  and  higher  cropping  intensity,  thereby  helping  to \nreduce food security concerns. \n \n9. \nThe  facility  will  address  several  factors  constraining  efficiently  upgrading  existing \ninfrastructure for water resources, expanding coverage to new areas, and enhancing prevention \n\nimproved \n\n                                                 \n4  Government of Nepal. 2005.

These include the outdated Irrigation Master Plan (IMP),6 difficulty in \nidentifying  projects  for  funding  without  well-defined  priorities,  and  lengthy  time  needed  to  start \nup and implement projects after their approval. For example, the Community-Managed Irrigated \nAgriculture  Sector  Project7  had  a  very  slow  start;  physical  improvement  works  on  irrigation \nsystems commenced 3 years after approval.8 The facility is designed to overcome this type of \nimplementation delay for future projects. It will also address the need, identified in the NWP and \nthe  CPS,  to  pay  greater  attention  to  climate-induced  disasters,  especially  in  the  context  of \nNepal\u2019s vulnerability to climate change. In this context, the design of individual projects and their \ncomponents as well as the selection of subprojects will be based partly on the need to take into \naccount and mitigate the likely impacts of climate change. \n \n10. \nThe facility conforms to recommendations made in the recent sector assistance program \nevaluation  in  Nepal,  which  recommends  an  increased  strategic  focus  in  supporting  the \nagriculture and natural resources sector by increasing investment in rural infrastructure such as \nirrigation,  rural  roads,  and  markets.9  The  facility  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Plan  for \nSustainable  Food  Security  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,10  which  recommends  enhancing  ADB\u2019s \nmultisector food security engagement with improved water productivity and increased resilience \nagainst natural disasters (flood and drought risk management) as major contributors; and Water \nOperational  Plan,11  which  aims  to  improve  efficient  use  of  water  and  enhance  agricultural \nproductivity. By producing more food with less water and preventing water-induced damage and \ndisasters to productive land, infrastructure, and property, the facility will be fully consistent with \nthe  priorities  of  the  government  and  ADB  to  enhance  climate  resilience,  ensure  food  security, \npromote environmental sustainability, and promote inclusive economic growth. \n \nliaison,  cooperation,  and  synergies  with  other \n11. \ndevelopment  partners,12  in  particular  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  Nepal  Risk  Reduction \nConsortium,13  on  water-induced  disaster  prevention.

To speed up implementation of the facility, the government has asked ADB to help with \nconsultant  recruitment  up  to  the  point  of  contract  negotiation  for  three  packages:  (i)  facility \n                                                 \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  preparation  of  the  Mid-Hills  Irrigation  Efficiency \nImprovement  Project,  and  (iii)  water-induced  hazard  mapping  and  preparation  of  the  Water- \nInduced Disaster Prevention Project. The facility management consultants will support DOI with \nrecruiting the remaining two consulting service packages. All procurement will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  on  a  90:10  ratio18  in  line \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe projects to be prepared under the facility will be subject to full technical assessment. \n25. \nThis  will  include  the  availability  and  quality  of  surface  water  or  groundwater  for  irrigation;  the \nappropriate design of water control structures including designs for flood resistance and climate \nchange  adaptation;  the  use  of  easily  obtained  construction  materials;  the  level  of  O&M \nresponsibility  devolved  to  water  users;  construction  quality  assurance;  linkage  to  agriculture \nintensification,  diversification,  and  commercialization  activities;  and  incorporation  of  effective \ndesign innovations. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nAll ensuing projects to be prepared by the facility will be assessed for their economic and \nfinancial viability as well as sustainability, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects,19 assessing the economic life of the schemes and identifying the economic \nbenefits  of  each  investment  scheme  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  situations.  The \nfinancial  analysis  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB,20  calculating  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  overall  investment  and  establishing  financial  viability  by \ncomparing  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  with  the  cost  of  capital,  taking  into  account \nfinancial costs and benefits. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  were  undertaken  for \nDOI. No substantive risks are identified. DOI has implemented numerous development partner-\nassisted  projects  including  the  prior  Community-Managed  Irrigated  Agriculture  Sector  Project \nand has the organizational structure, skills, financial management, and procurement system to \nimplement the facility. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith MOI, DOI, and DWIDP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  18).  In  the  interest  of  transparency  and  equal  opportunity,  all \nrequirements for consulting services and goods procurement will be published on the MOI and \nDOI  websites,  and  an  FMU  officer  will  be  delegated  to  be  the  contact  point  for  queries  and \n\n                                                 \n18 A 90:10 ratio is necessary due to the importance of ensuring high-quality preparation of the ensuing projects and \n\n19 ADB. 1997.

The projects \nto be prepared by the facility are expected to have major positive impacts on poverty reduction, \ngender  equality,  and  social  inclusiveness.  These  will  be  achieved  through  increases  in \nagricultural production, which will enhance food security in deficit areas, generate employment, \npromote  equal  opportunity  and  wages,  and  increase  rural  incomes.  Awareness  and  training \nsessions will enhance the participation of farmers (including women and marginalized farmers) \nand  increase  their  capacity  in  operation  and  management  of  irrigation  schemes.  A  change  to \nhigher  value  crops  will  increase  income  and  employment  opportunities,  while  increased \nproduction overall will generate employment through processing and marketing activities, many \nof which are traditionally undertaken by women. \n \n30. \nFollow-on  projects  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998)  and  ADB's  Handbook  on  Social  Analysis.21  Gender,  consultation  and \nparticipation,  labor,  and  other  social  risks  relating  to  follow-on  projects  will  be  assessed,  and \nmitigation  plans  will  be  prepared  to  address  those  issues  during  project  preparation.  A  GESI \naction framework was prepared to ensure GESI responsiveness in ensuing projects. It is to be \napplied  as  a  guideline  in  the  development  of  a  GESI  action  plan  during  project  preparation.22 \nBased  on  the  guideline,  gender  and  social  analysis  will  be  undertaken  for  ensuing  projects  to \ndetermine how women and traditionally excluded groups will be impacted by the projects. \n \nE. \n \nSince  the  facility  mainly  entails  studies  and  the  preparation  of  candidate  projects  for \n31. \nfunding  as  well  as  some  capacity-building  activities,  and  will  not  involve  any  physical \nimplementation,  the  safeguard  categories  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples  are  all  \u201cC.\u201d  In  general,  most  of  the  ensuing  projects  are  not  anticipated  to \nentail any significant environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples issues. Most \nof  the  investments  in  water  resource  management  are  likely  to  entail  the  upgrading  and \nimproved  usage  of  existing  infrastructure  or  environmental  improvements  through  flood \nprotection  and  water-induced  disaster  risk-reduction  measures.  Nonetheless,  a  full  review  and \nassessment  of  safeguard  issues  along  with  the  preparation  of  mitigation  measures  will  be \nincluded  in  each  of  the  preparatory  studies,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and government guidelines, regulations, and policies. \n \nOne  positive  aspect  of  the  facility\u2019s  capacity-building  activities  is  that  it  will  include \n32. \nupgrading  DOI\u2019s  Environment  Section  to  a  social  and  environment  section  and  establishing  a \nsocial  and  environment  desk  within  DWIDP.  Training  in  safeguard  measures  for  staff  of  MOI, \nDOI, and DWIDP will strengthen safeguard concerns in project preparation and implementation. \n \n33. \nTo  ensure  environmental  and  social  safeguards  of  ensuing projects,  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and  indigenous  peoples  planning \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1994.

Subprojects  with \ncategory A impacts in terms of the environment, resettlement, or indigenous peoples will not be \nincluded in the scope of any projects prepared under the facility. \n \nF. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.
