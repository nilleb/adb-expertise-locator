I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Water Resources Project Preparatory Facility.1 \n \n2.  The  facility  will  support  the  Government  of  Nepal\u2019s  efforts  to  ensure  that  critically \nimportant  water  resource  projects  are  implemented  efficiently  by  advancing  preparatory \nactivities in a systematic manner, through planning and appraising high-priority projects for \npotential funding by the government and development partners. This will contribute significantly \nto improving implementation performance of the ensuing projects by reducing the gap from \nproject  approval  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \ncommencement of improvement works, helping to achieve the intended outcomes efficiently \nand realizing their impact and benefits quickly.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal,  largely  an  agrarian  economy,  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  climate  and \navailability  of  natural  resources  including  water.3  While  water  resources  face  additional \ndemands with the increasing amount of water required for energy and urban use to support \ncontinuing economic growth, irrigation still accounts for 87% of water use and water remains the \nmost critical input for food security. Most opportunities to improve agricultural production  and, \nthus,  reduce  poverty  and  food  deficiencies  depend  on  improved  infrastructure  for  water \nresources, improved management of the infrastructure, improved water use efficiency, and \nprotection of crops and infrastructure from water-induced disasters such as floods, landslides, \nand land erosion. \n \n4.  Climate change threatens to reduce the effectiveness of development initiatives across \nNepal. In some regions, increasing drought will impair food security and affect the availability of \nwater resources; while in others, increases in the intensity of rains will cause increased flooding \nand landslide risks threatening human security, water supplies, and infrastructure. In the hill and \nmountain regions in particular (accounting for two-thirds of the land area), reduced food security \nresults in the increasing use of more and more marginal land for food production. This, in turn, \nresults in increasing environmental instability in the fragile mountain ecological system through \naccelerated soil erosion and increased runoff during the monsoon season. On the other hand, \naccess to water for irrigation allows intensive food crop cultivation on higher quality, more \nproductive  land,  thus  increasing  overall  food  production  and  forestalling  environmental \ndegradation of less-productive marginal areas. The preparation of readily implementable water \nresource projects to address these issues is thus crucial for the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus and \nfor climate-resilient food security and environmental sustainability. \n \n5.  The provision of adequate water through supplementary irrigation can double or triple \ncrop yields in the monsoon season, and dry season irrigation can produce crops when none \ncould be grown before. The combination of effective and efficient land and water use can thus \nhave a major impact on food security and environmental stability. To this effect, since the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The facility was prepared without project preparatory technical assistance. In 2010, ADB approved a similar project \npreparatory facility for the transport sector. ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Grant to Nepal for the Transport Project Preparatory Facility. Manila. \n3 Government of Nepal, Ministry of the Environment. 2010. National Adaptation Programme for Action. Kathmandu. ", "2 \n1980s, Nepal has significantly increased rural livelihoods through investment in water resource \ninfrastructure, improved agriculture technology and extension services, and enhanced rural \naccess. However, at present, only 38% of the irrigated area is provided with irrigation water on a \nyear-round basis and not all of this is used efficiently. On the other hand, during years of intense \nrainfall, both crops and infrastructure are likely to be damaged by catastrophic floods and fertile \nsoils can be washed away. As a consequence, almost half of the districts, particularly from the \nhill and mountains of the far-western, mid-western, and eastern development regions, are still \nfood deficient. \n \n6.  Nepal\u2019s population continues to grow and, with the current growth rate, is expected to \nreach 38 million (from about 24 million) by 2025. This means that, for the country to remain food \nsufficient  and  avoid  serious  environmental  degradation  as  a  result  of  unstable  cultivation \npractices, agricultural production will have to continue growing, particularly in irrigated areas. \nIndeed,  the  provision  of  year-round  irrigation,  both  as  supplementary  irrigation  during  the \nmonsoon season and full irrigation during the dry season, is crucial to achieve the full potential \nof the agriculture resources, ensure the efficient use of land and water, and prevent food \ninsecurity and further environmental deterioration. Further, with irrigation, the risk of crop failure \nis mitigated and farmers are provided with an incentive to invest in more productive farming and \nhigh-value crops, thus increasing the efficient and effective use of land and water resources. \nHowever, the provision of physical infrastructure on its own is not enough to ensure efficient \nland and water use. For irrigation to have its full potential impact, irrigation facilities must be \ncomplemented with improved water distribution and management, strengthened water user \nassociations,  improved  system  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  improved  farming \ntechnologies  and  marketing,  and  increased  protection  from  catastrophic  floods  during  the \nmonsoon season. \n \n7.  The  government\u2019s  2005  National  Water  Plan  (NWP)4  aims  to  increase  the  area  of \nirrigable land provided with irrigation facilities from the current 65% to 97% by 2027, an increase \nin year-round irrigation coverage from the current 38% of irrigated area to 67%, and an average \ncropping intensity increase within year-round irrigated areas from the current 140% to 193%. It \nalso  aims  to  put  in  place  infrastructure  to  mitigate  predictable  water-induced  disasters  in  \n20  districts  and  to  establish  functional  water-induced  disaster  warning  systems  throughout \nNepal by 2017. An important facet of the NWP is its emphasis on integrated water resources \nmanagement, which is recognized as a key principle governing water and energy development. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Nepal5  proposes  that  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  explore  interventions  to  improve  food  security  including  supporting  greater \navailability of water and year-round irrigation to help mitigate recent erratic rainfall patterns. It \nnotes that ADB will (i) introduce disaster screening into its operations in Nepal to ensure that \nnew investments factor in disaster risks, and maximize mitigation measures; (ii) assist the \ngovernment in strengthening the capacity of agencies for managing disaster risks; and (iii) help \nthe government implement ongoing flood damage rehabilitation. The agriculture and natural \nresources sector road map for the CPS further notes that improved access to year-round \nirrigation would enable crop diversification and higher cropping intensity, thereby helping to \nreduce food security concerns. \n \n9.  The  facility  will  address  several  factors  constraining  efficiently  upgrading  existing \ninfrastructure for water resources, expanding coverage to new areas, and enhancing prevention \n                                                 \n4  Government of Nepal. 2005.

These include the outdated Irrigation Master Plan (IMP),6 difficulty in \nidentifying projects for funding without well-defined priorities, and lengthy time needed to start \nup and implement projects after their approval. For example, the Community-Managed Irrigated \nAgriculture Sector Project7 had a very slow start; physical improvement works on irrigation \nsystems commenced 3 years after approval.8 The facility is designed to overcome this type of \nimplementation delay for future projects. It will also address the need, identified in the NWP and \nthe CPS, to pay greater attention to climate-induced disasters, especially in the context of \nNepal\u2019s vulnerability to climate change. In this context, the design of individual projects and their \ncomponents as well as the selection of subprojects will be based partly on the need to take into \naccount and mitigate the likely impacts of climate change. \n \n10.  The facility conforms to recommendations made in the recent sector assistance program \nevaluation  in  Nepal,  which  recommends  an  increased  strategic  focus  in  supporting  the \nagriculture and natural resources sector by increasing investment in rural infrastructure such as \nirrigation, rural roads, and markets.9 The facility is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nSustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific,10 which recommends enhancing ADB\u2019s \nmultisector food security engagement with improved water productivity and increased resilience \nagainst natural disasters (flood and drought risk management) as major contributors; and Water \nOperational  Plan,11  which  aims  to  improve  efficient  use  of  water  and  enhance  agricultural \nproductivity. By producing more food with less water and preventing water-induced damage and \ndisasters to productive land, infrastructure, and property, the facility will be fully consistent with \nthe priorities of the government and ADB to enhance climate resilience, ensure food security, \npromote environmental sustainability, and promote inclusive economic growth. \n \n11.  The  facility  will  actively  pursue  liaison,  cooperation,  and  synergies  with  other \ndevelopment  partners,12  in  particular  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  Nepal  Risk  Reduction \nConsortium,13  on  water-induced  disaster  prevention.  ADB  missions  have  met  development \npartners that are active in promoting water use efficiency and preventing water-related disasters \nin Nepal. The project design has benefited from development partner experience and lessons \nfrom similar projects. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  more  water-efficient  and  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  food \nproduction system. The outcome will be improved readiness of water resource management \nprojects for implementation. \n \n                                                 \n6 Government of Nepal. 1990.

Outputs \n13.  The outputs will be (i) detailed feasibility studies for high-priority water resource projects; \n(ii) improved environmental, social, and technical capacity of the Department of Irrigation (DOI) \nand the Department of Water-Induced Disaster Prevention (DWIDP); (iii) updated IMP;14 and  \n(iv) efficient facility management. The outputs will be delivered through four components. \n \n1.  Detailed Feasibility Studies \n14.  The facility will aim to prepare detailed feasibility studies for three projects15 for potential \nfinancing by ADB and other development partners: \n \n(i)  Mid-Hills  Irrigation  Efficiency  Improvement  Project16  to  upgrade  inefficient \nirrigation schemes to fully functional status; build up farmer water user groups \nthrough appropriate community organization and training for sustained O&M; and \nprovide  training  and  support  for  enhanced  agricultural  production,  improved \nmarketing, and value addition on the improved schemes; \n(ii)  Water-Induced Disaster Prevention Project in the Naryani river basin, based on \nwater-induced  hazard  mapping,  to  prevent  and  alleviate  risks  to  human \nsettlements and damage to productive agricultural land by flood, sedimentation, \nriverbank erosion, and landslides; it will include funding for water-induced hazard \nmapping for the rest of Nepal as required by the NWP; and \n(iii)  Terai  Irrigation  Efficiency  Improvement  Project  to  rehabilitate  and  restore \nschemes to full productive capacity and develop groundwater irrigation using \ndeep and shallow tubewells. \n \n15.  Projects  will  be  prepared  to  the  detailed  feasibility  stage,  including  technical  study; \nsafeguard screening and plan preparation; gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) analysis, \nand GESI action plan preparation; and economic and financial analyses of at least 30% of the \nsubprojects for project readiness, thereby advancing activities that would normally occupy the \nfirst 1\u20132 start-up years of project implementation. Specific climate change adaptation measures \nwill be considered in the design of each project. Prior to and during these activities, extensive \nand intensive consultations will be held with potential beneficiaries and measures taken to \nstrengthen water user associations in preparation for physical implementation subproject works. \n \n2.  Improved  Department  of  Irrigation  and  Department  of  Water-Induced \nDisaster Prevention  \n16.  The facility will enhance the capacity of DOI and DWIDP staff through formal and on-the-\njob training (including participation in project preparation). It will strengthen and upgrade DOI\u2019s \nEnvironment  Section  as  a  social  and  environment  section  and  establish  a  social  and \nenvironment desk within DWIDP, providing (i) clear terms of reference for the section and desk, \n(ii) environmental and social safeguard guidelines on safeguard planning and implementation, \nand (iii) GESI guidelines for planning and implementation.

The facility will also conduct a comprehensive assessment of the institutional capacity of \nDOI and DWIDP and prepare a needs assessment report, including capacity development plan, \nstaffing, and budget. Based on the needs assessment, DOI and DWIDP staff will be trained in \nnew and innovative technology, information science, and management. To complement their \nrole in mapping water-induced hazards and other related activities, training will be provided for \nDWIDP and DOI staff in remote sensing, geographic information system mapping, disaster \npreparedness planning, and information sharing. \n \n3.  Updated Irrigation Master Plan  \n18.  The facility will support updating of the IMP to reflect changes in land use, water use, \nagricultural technology, irrigation, and water resource policy and legislation, and develop an \ninventory of high-priority irrigation infrastructure investment needs to guide the government and \ndevelopment  partners  in  identifying  and  prioritizing  future  investments  in  this  important \nsubsector.  The  development  partners  active  in  promoting  the  water\u2013food\u2013energy  nexus  in \nNepal will set up an advisory group to work with the government on updating the IMP. \n \n4.  Efficient Facility Management \n19.  A facility management unit (FMU) will be set up with qualified staff within DOI.

The facility (comprising the preparation of investment projects, updating of the IMP, and \ncapacity building) is not expected to have any negative poverty or social impacts. The projects \nto be prepared by the facility are expected to have major positive impacts on poverty reduction, \ngender  equality,  and  social  inclusiveness.  These  will  be  achieved  through  increases  in \nagricultural production, which will enhance food security in deficit areas, generate employment, \npromote equal opportunity and wages, and increase rural incomes. Awareness and training \nsessions will enhance the participation of farmers (including women and marginalized farmers) \nand increase their capacity in operation and management of irrigation schemes. A change to \nhigher  value  crops  will  increase  income  and  employment  opportunities,  while  increased \nproduction overall will generate employment through processing and marketing activities, many \nof which are traditionally undertaken by women. \n \n30.  Follow-on projects will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment  (1998)  and  ADB's  Handbook  on  Social  Analysis.21  Gender,  consultation  and \nparticipation, labor, and other social risks relating to follow-on projects will be assessed, and \nmitigation plans will be prepared to address those issues during project preparation. A GESI \naction framework was prepared to ensure GESI responsiveness in ensuing projects. It is to be \napplied as a guideline in the development of a GESI action plan during project preparation.22 \nBased on the guideline, gender and social analysis will be undertaken for ensuing projects to \ndetermine how women and traditionally excluded groups will be impacted by the projects. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Since the facility mainly entails studies and the preparation of candidate projects for \nfunding  as  well  as  some  capacity-building  activities,  and  will  not  involve  any  physical \nimplementation, the safeguard categories for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples are all \u201cC.\u201d In general, most of the ensuing projects are not anticipated to \nentail any significant environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples issues. Most \nof  the  investments  in  water  resource  management  are  likely  to  entail  the  upgrading  and \nimproved  usage  of  existing  infrastructure  or  environmental  improvements  through  flood \nprotection and water-induced disaster risk-reduction measures. Nonetheless, a full review and \nassessment of safeguard issues along with the preparation of mitigation measures will be \nincluded  in  each  of  the  preparatory  studies,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and government guidelines, regulations, and policies. \n \n32.  One  positive  aspect  of  the  facility\u2019s  capacity-building  activities  is  that  it  will  include \nupgrading DOI\u2019s Environment Section to a social and environment section and establishing a \nsocial and environment desk within DWIDP. Training in safeguard measures for staff of MOI, \nDOI, and DWIDP will strengthen safeguard concerns in project preparation and implementation. \n \n33.  To ensure environmental and social safeguards of ensuing projects, the environmental \nassessment and review framework, resettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1994.

Subprojects with \ncategory A impacts in terms of the environment, resettlement, or indigenous peoples will not be \nincluded in the scope of any projects prepared under the facility. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The integrated benefits \nand impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the potential costs from risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nNatural disasters and  Disaster and climate change risk screening was conducted to assess the exposure \nclimate change  of the Water Resources Project Preparatory Facility to climate-induced risk and \nnatural disasters. \nWater-induced hazard mapping to be undertaken under the facility will identify areas \nof major river basins most prone to natural disasters and negative impacts of climate \nchange. \nThe projects to be prepared under the facility will help farmers adapt to long periods \nof drought through improved irrigation and water use efficiency in subproject areas. \nThe  social  mobilization  and  capacity  development  program  under  the  ensuing \nprojects will help farmers and DOI and DWIDP staff better understand the impacts \nof climate change, and identify adaptation and mitigation measures. \nDelays to the start-up  The establishment of the FMU will be accelerated through the use of advance \nof facility  procurement and retroactive financing for office equipment, vehicles, and consulting \nimplementation  services. \nThe government has included the facility in the budget for fiscal year 2013. \nDelays in consultant  The facility design entails strong ADB involvement in the recruitment of the first \nrecruitment and poor  three of five packages of consulting services. \nquality of consulting  Management and capacity-building supports are provided to the FMU to assist in \nservices provided  recruiting the other two packages and in supervising consulting service inputs and \nmonitoring the output. \nFull safeguards and gender equality and social inclusion frameworks were prepared \nso that consultants have a precise guide to follow while preparing safeguard and \ngender aspects of the ensuring projects and of the updated Irrigation Master Plan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOI = Department of Irrigation, DWIDP = Department of Water-Induced Disaster \nPrevention, FMU = facility management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.
