I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Sector Development Program.1   \n \n2.  The proposed program will assist the Government of Cambodia to meet the objectives of \nthe Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III,2 and its \nNational  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2014\u201320183 through  (i)  increased  access  to  TVET \nprograms, particularly for women and the poor; (ii) improved quality and relevance of the TVET \nsystem;  (iii)  increased  involvement  of  employers  in  TVET  delivery;  and  (iv)  strengthened \ngovernance and management of the TVET system. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product grew by more than 7.0% per year from FY2011 to \nFY2013, despite the 2009 global financial crisis. It is projected to grow by 7.0% in FY2014 and \n7.3% in FY2015.4 The poverty headcount decreased from 47.8% in 2007 to 19.8% in 2011. \nHowever, approximately 75% of Cambodians live on less than $3 a day and are vulnerable. \nAgriculture  remains  vital  to  employment,  particularly  for  women;  however,  its  share  of \nemployment declined from 59% in 2007 to 54% in 2010.5 Foreign direct investment has played \nan increasingly important role in industrial development, creating new investments in automotive \nparts,  electronics,  and  the  agro-industry.  Domestic  consumption,  exports,  and  investment, \nespecially foreign investment, are projected to drive growth in the medium term. However, \ninvestors  indicate  that  an  inadequately  skilled  workforce  is  a  serious  constraint  to  doing \nbusiness in Cambodia.6 Progress in improving the country\u2019s skills base has been slow. From \n2004 to 2010, increases in school enrollment rates reduced the share of the labor force without \nany formal education by 6%. However, in 2011/12, the proportion of working-age women (15 \nyears or older) who had completed at least secondary education (25.8%) was below that of \nmales (38.6%), indicating gender inequality in access to education and training.7 \n \n4.  The Government of Cambodia emphasizes the role of skills development to reduce \npoverty  and  promote  inclusive  growth  as  part  of  its  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  Phase  III  (footnote  2)  and  its  National  Strategic \nDevelopment Plan, 2014\u20132018 (footnote 3). A recent study conducted in collaboration with \nCambodia\u2019s National Employment Agency forecasts an average of 1 million new jobs created \nannually from 2012\u20132015.8 While low-skilled occupations are forecast to be in highest demand \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   Government of Cambodia. 2013.

The government identifies the application of technology and business \nmanagement skills as the main drivers of development for all sectors. The government sees \npotential for attracting foreign direct investment in light engineering and related industries and \ntherefore prioritizes middle-level skills development in auto mechanics and electrical works \n(footnote 3). To support the growth of industry in Cambodia, a skilled manufacturing workforce \nmust  be  developed.  The  draft  TVET  strategic  plan,  2014\u20132018,  under  preparation  by  the \nMinistry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT), will guide TVET sector development to meet \nexisting and emerging labor market needs. \n \n5.  Issues in the technical and vocational education and training system. The formal \nTVET system under the MLVT remains in its infancy, and gaps in TVET access, quality, and \ninstitutional  capacity  constrain  Cambodia\u2019s  workforce  development.  Progression  to  formal \nTVET, which requires grade 9 completion, is less than 1% of secondary enrollments.9 Bridging \nprograms providing out-of-school youth a second chance to complete secondary education and \npursue TVET are very limited. Further, formal TVET is mainly offered in urban areas. Financial \nbarriers  such  as  course  fees  constrain  participation  and  completion  of  formal  TVET. \nParticipation of female students and those living in remote regions is deterred by the lack of \nhousing and limited part-time programs.   \n \n6.  Some public TVET institutions offer certificate and diploma level courses, but only in a \nlimited  number  of  fields.10 The  MLVT  will  establish  regional  training  centers  (RTCs)  in  five \nprovinces to scale up provincial training centers (PTCs) to offer certificate level courses. There are \nvery few private sector TVET providers at the certificate and diploma levels. Most public TVET \ninstitutions lack adequate, industry-relevant equipment and training facilities, and the quality of \nTVET  instructors  is  low.  The  formal  TVET  system  emphasizes  theoretical  knowledge  with \nlimited  practical  application.  The  Cambodia  Qualifications  Framework  (CQF)  was  recently \nformulated to enable uniform certification processes among public and private TVET providers, \nacross ministries, and between the nonformal and formal TVET systems. The voucher skills \ntraining program (VSTP) expanded under the ongoing Strengthening Technical and Vocational \nEducation and Training Project11 and the skills bridging program (SBP) initiated under the \nPiloting the Post-Harvest Technology and Skills Bridging Program for Rural Poor12 (funded by a \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant)  provide  opportunities  for  demand-driven  skills \ndevelopment. However, skills standards and standard training curricula are not applied to either \nprogram,  which  limits  opportunities  for  trainees  to  accumulate  skills  and  undertake  further \ntraining in the formal TVET sector.  \n \n7.  While the National Training Board (NTB) stipulates that TVET be demand driven, there \nis  limited  use  of  systematic  labor  market  information  or  employer  surveys  to  identify  skill \nshortages  to  inform  TVET  course  offerings.13 Strengthening  capacity  for  managing  and \ncoordinating TVET and involving the NTB in policy formulation and implementation are ongoing \n                                                \n9  Annually, 230,000 students drop out before grade 9, and 100,000 school dropouts enter the labor market. In \nSY2009\u20132010, secondary enrollment was 908,698 and formal TVET enrollment was 746.   \n10 Certificate and diploma level refers to middle-level skills development (levels 2\u20134 of the Cambodian Qualifications \nFramework).  \n11 ADB. 2009.

Weak management and coordination, inadequate financing, and lack of labor market \ndata  have  led  to  weak  TVET  program  development,  management,  and  supervision. \nCollaboration with the private sector in TVET policy and program development is nascent, and \ngenerally limited to the development of skills standards and curricula. \n \n8.  Sector  development  program  approach.  The  government  has  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) support for the three policy themes in the draft TVET strategic plan, \n2014\u20132018: (i) equitable access to TVET, (ii) enhanced quality and relevance of TVET, and (iii) \nstrengthened  governance  and  management  of  TVET.  The  sector  development  program \nmodality will provide policy-based program support to help finance reforms that seek to make \nthe TVET system more relevant to the needs of the labor market. ADB\u2019s proposed country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia prioritizes development of the TVET sector.14 \n \n9.  Building  on  achievements  of  past  ADB  support.  The program is the first sector \ndevelopment  program  focused  on  TVET.  It  follows  earlier  education  sector  development \nprograms in Cambodia that supported the expansion of basic education and the nonformal \nTVET system (footnote 11). The program builds on the ongoing Strengthening Technical and \nVocational Education and Training Project15 to continue the development of a formal TVET \nsystem by (i) strengthening RTCs to deliver middle-level skills training; (ii) implementing a \ncompetency-based  curriculum,  including  assessment;  (iii)  establishing  sector  skills  councils \nbased on the initial industry advisory groups formed; and (iv) enhancing the VSTP to better \nserve the majority of the Cambodian labor force who are employed in low-skilled agricultural \njobs and/or in the informal sector. The program also builds on the Piloting the Post-Harvest \nTraining and Skills Bridging Program for Rural Poor by enhancing the SBP to better serve out-\nof-school youth to enter formal TVET (footnote 12). \n \n10.  Lessons. Program design has been informed by a number of lessons from previous ADB \nTVET assistance:  (i) systemic reforms need to be prioritized in terms of timeframe and capacity \nof  the  executing  agency;  (ii)  TVET  strategies  need  to  be  formulated  alongside  secondary \neducation development given the large proportion of low-skilled workers requiring secondary \neducation; (iii) capacity building for institutional finance and business planning is essential to \naddress financial sustainability of costs for infrastructure maintenance, training programs, and \npro-poor subsidies; and (iv) long-term interventions, which allow for evolution in program focus \n(e.g., from access to quality and relevance), are more likely to be sustained.  \n \n11.  Innovative  features.  The  program  includes  several  key  innovative  features.  Policy \nactions and project interventions will develop an assessment system for the recognition of prior \nlearning and current competencies (RPLCC) acquired through nonformal or formal training, or \nthrough  work  and  life  experience.  Flexibility  in  the  recognition  of  skills  and  knowledge \nacquisition  will  enable  increased  access  to  TVET  programs.  The  program  also  includes \ninnovative strategies for private sector and employer engagement in TVET sector development, \nsuch as (i) development of centers of excellence (COEs) that teach a single technical subject in \nthe priority sectors of construction, auto mechanics, electrical works, and manufacturing; and (ii) \nan apprenticeship program to provide industry experience to TVET instructors.  \n \n                                                \n14 ADB.

Development partner coordination. Development partners significantly contributing to \nTVET in Cambodia include ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.16 The TVET \ncoordination working group, chaired by the MLVT\u2019s directorate general of TVET (DGTVET), was \nestablished  in  2013  to  promote  policy  dialogue  and  coordinate  support  in  developing  and \nimplementing the MLVT\u2019s TVET strategic plan. The TVET coordination working group, which \nconsists of representatives from development partners (ADB, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and others) and the Cambodian Federation of Employers and Business Associations, \nwas consulted during program design. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the program will be increased employability of TVET-certified workers. \nThe outcome of the program will be an accessible, demand-driven TVET system responsive to \ncontinuing and emerging labor market demands. The program is nationwide in scope, reaching \npoor and disadvantaged youth living in the poorest communes.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The  program  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  increased  access  to  TVET  programs, \nparticularly for women and the poor; (ii) improved quality and relevance of the TVET system; (iii) \nincreased involvement of employers in TVET delivery; and (iv) strengthened governance and \nmanagement of the TVET system. Project interventions and policy actions are closely aligned. \n \n15.  Output 1: Increased access to technical and vocational education and training \nprograms.  The  program  will  support  a  sub-decree,  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister,  to \nimplement  the  CQF  for  the  development  of  flexible  pathways  between  different  levels  of \nqualifications,  leading  Cambodians  to  access  education  and  training  opportunities  towards \nlifelong learning and facilitating regional mobilization of Cambodia\u2019s skilled workforce. Access to \nTVET  programs  will  be  increased  through  the  following  policy  actions:  (i)  introduction  of \nvocational skills certification (VSC) at CQF level 1 as an alternative entry pathway into the \nformal TVET system; and (ii) assessment policy and certification policy defining the process for \nRPLCC to allow more qualified Cambodians to enter the formal TVET system.  \n \n16.  The project will (i) support the development of qualification requirements for piloting the \nVSC with existing nonformal TVET courses in auto mechanics, construction, and information \nand communication technology and/or business offered by public TVET institutions; (ii) train 80 \nstaff from the DGTVET, public TVET institutions, and managers of assessment centers to \nimplement RPLCC; (iii) train 200 assessors (10% female) from  public TVET institutions to \nconduct  competency  assessments  required  for  RPLCC;  and  (iv)  support  piloting  RPLCC, \nincluding  competency  assessments,  for  150  young  adults  (10%  female)  enrolled  in  TVET \ncourses in auto mechanics, construction, and information and communication technology and/or \nbusiness. RPLCC will be rolled out to assess around 900 Cambodians (70% from the poorest \ncommunes and 30% identified as disadvantaged) for competency in the above sectors over a \nperiod of 2 years. The project will also support 4,000 poor and disadvantaged youth (30% \nwomen) with stipends for middle-level training. Three female dormitories will be built at PTCs. \nCareer mentorship programs will be piloted in these dormitories.17 Project interventions will \nsupport the development of a social marketing campaign to improve the public perception of \nTVET and vocationally oriented occupations, particularly among women and the disadvantaged. \n                                                \n16 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Pilot will include outsourcing dormitory management and operation and delivery of the career mentorship program.  \n ", "5 \n \n17.  Output 2: Improved quality and relevance of technical and vocational education \nand training system. The program will support a Prakas (i.e., proclamation),18 issued by the \nMLVT, for the registration of TVET institutions to ensure compliance with quality standards. To \noperationalize the registration system, the project will introduce a quality assurance system for \npublic TVET institutions in Cambodia. The program will also support a national TVET policy to \nguide  the  development  of  high-quality,  skilled,  and  capable  human  resources  under  the \ndecentralized  TVET  system  to  promote  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development \nthrough innovation and partnerships with key stakeholders, including the private sector.  \n \n18.  The project will implement the national TVET policy through (i) the establishment of a \ncompetency-based  assessment  and  certification  system  including  the  VSC,  and  (ii)  the \nintroduction of competency-based TVET instructor training at the National Technical Training \nInstitute. An instructor apprenticeship program will be developed to allow instructors from public \nTVET  institutions  to  gain  industry  experience.  Approximately  600  TVET  instructors  will  be \ntrained. Using competency-based training, the project will enhance the quality and relevance of \nthe VSTP and SBP by (i) forming stronger linkages to the labor market, (ii) alignment with the \nCQF, and (iii) integration of gender inclusive principles in program design. Approximately 35,000 \ntrainees (60% female) will be supported through the VSTP.19 The existing SBP will be improved \nto  include  a  gender-inclusive  learning  module  on  career  opportunities  following  vocational \ntraining.20 The project will also (i) target about 6,400 trainees (approximately 50% female) to \nenroll in the SBP; (ii) finance the construction of one classroom building and nine workshops, \nincluding equipment; and (iii) finance rehabilitation of the DGTVET building. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Increased  involvement  of  employers  in  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training delivery.  For greater involvement of employers in TVET delivery, the \nprogram will support issuance of a circular on \u201cPromoting High Quality and Effective Technical \nand Vocational Education and Training,\u201d signed by the Prime Minister, which will facilitate \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  to  ensure  that  access  to  TVET  is  equitable,  responsive  to  the \ndemands of the labor market, leads to increased productivity, and contributes to economic \ndevelopment. The program will support an NTB-approved policy to reform internship programs \noffered by public TVET institutions and to engage the private sector in TVET dialogue.  \n \n20.  The project will establish sector skills councils composed of industry associations and \nlarge  employers  representing  four  priority  sectors:  construction,  auto  mechanics,  electrical \nworks, and manufacturing. Sector skills councils will be engaged to support the development of \nCOEs in priority sectors, as well as to establish  (i) sector-specific soft skills training programs in \ncooperation with COEs, and (ii) an apprenticeship program for TVET instructors in cooperation \nwith the National Technical Training Institute. The project will also support the reform of the \ninternship program in cooperation with industry liaison units and COEs. A total of 200 trainees \n(20% female) will receive stipends for internships associated with training at CQF levels 2 to 4. \n \n21.  Output  4:  Strengthened  governance  and  management  of  the  technical  and \nvocational  education  and  training  system.  To  facilitate  the  management  of  the  TVET \nsystem,21 the program will support a Prakas, issued by the MLVT, authorizing specific public \nTVET institutions to offer fee-based courses to generate revenue from students and employers \n                                                \n18 A Prakas or proclamation is a ministerial or interministerial decision signed by the relevant Minister/s. \n19 The VSTP will promote gender equity through identification of skills needs and training programs for women.  \n20 SBP training packages will be outsourced to qualified nongovernment organization TVET providers. \n21 A capacity development technical assistance project is proposed to strengthen the capacity of DGTVET in sector \nplanning, budgeting, and the development of the national TVET policy and gender policy. This will further support \nstrengthened governance and management. The technical assistance will be processed separately. \n ", "6 \n \nwho finance employees\u2019 training. The program will also support a sub-decree, signed by the \nPrime Minister, to direct the collection and dissemination of labor market information to inform \ntraining programs. The project will build the capacity of public TVET institution directors in \nplanning, budgeting, program implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. It will also finance \nstart-up costs for public TVET institutions to deliver courses at CQF levels 2 to 4 in construction, \nauto mechanics, and information and communication technology and/or business. Each RTC \nwill implement up to 90 courses for approximately 2,700 trainees. Capacity of the 26 PTCs will \nbe strengthened to deliver CQF level 2 training programs in the above sectors. PTCs will deliver \naround 234 courses for approximately 7,000 participants.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  Program  financing  is  estimated  to  cost  $32.6  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  The \ngovernment has requested a policy-based loan and a project loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources.22  \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan  \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n  Special Funds resources (policy-based loan)  7.0  21.5 \nAsian Development Bank     \n      Special Funds resources (project loan)  23.0  70.5 \nGovernment of Cambodiaa  2.6  8.0 \nTotal  32.6  100.0 \na Includes government cash contribution of $2.43 million and in-kind government contribution of $0.17 million.     \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n23.  Policy-based  loan  financing  plan.  To  support  the  foreseen  direct  and  indirect \nadjustment costs of reforms, the government has requested a policy-based loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to $7 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a \n24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft policy-based loan agreement. The policy-based loan amount was determined based on \n(i) adjustment costs in preparing, implementing, and monitoring the proposed policy actions; (ii) \nMLVT capacity development; and (iii) the relative importance ascribed by the government to \nTVET sector development. The policy-based loan will be released in two equal tranches, in \naccordance with provisions set out in ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements for Program Loans: tranche 1 in the amount of $3.5 million will be released by loan \neffectiveness, and tranche 2 in the amount of $3.5 million will be released by the end of 2017.23 \n \n24.  Project loan investment plan. The project is estimated to cost $25.6 million equivalent. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $23.0 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project (Table 2). The loan will have a 32-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  project  loan  agreement.  Interest  during  implementation,  recurrent  costs,  local \ntransportation, and insurance costs will be covered under the project loan. The government \ncontribution of $2.6 million will cover supplementary salaries for counterpart staff, taxes and \nduties, civil works, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n                                                \n22 Additional financing from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement is possible at a later time.  \n23 ADB. 1998.

The  SDR \n4,533,000 policy-based loan will be disbursed in two tranches, in accordance \n                                                \n24  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998): (i) tranche 1 [SDR2,266,500] by loan \neffectiveness, and (ii) tranche 2 [SDR2,266,500] by end of 2017. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants qualification selection, DGTVET = directorate general of technical \nand vocational education and training, ICB = international competitive bidding, MLVT = Ministry of Labour and \nVocational Training, NCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The  program\u2019s  direct  economic  benefits  flow  from  the  increased  number  of  TVET-\ncertified  workers  and  the  improved  labor  market  outcomes  from  more  relevant  TVET \nprograms.25 The direct beneficiaries of the project will be the more than 40,000 trainees who \nbenefit  from  interventions  aimed  at  increasing  access  to,  and  improving  the  quality  and \nrelevance  of, formal TVET  in  Cambodia.  Five  main  categories  of  beneficiaries  have  been \nidentified: (i) recipients of the stipends for training at CQF levels 2 to 4, (ii) recipients of stipends \nfor internships, (iii) trainees of the enhanced VSTP, (iv) trainees of the enhanced SBP, and (v) \ntrainees of public TVET institutions receiving support to deliver courses at CQF levels 2 to 4. \nUtilization rates are likely to be high because priority skills areas under the project were selected \nbased on an assessment of labor market supply and demand.    \n \n27.  Based on conservative assumptions, skills development may increase monthly wages by \n18% to 127%, depending on the level of training. Assuming 56% of beneficiaries receive training \nunder the project and utilize their newfound skills and knowledge in the labor market for up to 10 \nyears,  average  annual  earnings  could  increase  by  approximately  $6.0  million  per  year. \nEstimating these benefits over 20 years and using the total project cost of $23.6 million plus an \nannual recurrent cost of $0.1 million yields an economic internal rate of return of 24.0%. \n \n28.  Financial sustainability. The MLVT recurrent budget increased from $13.1 million in \n2009 to $26.9 million in 2013, while the DGTVET recurrent budget tripled from $5.4 million to \n$16.6 million over the same period. Increases in the DGTVET program-based budget can \nsustain key project interventions. Recurrent expenditures (e.g., additional operating costs of \nPTCs and RTCs and equipment maintenance costs) can be absorbed by additional revenues \nfrom government funding. The average incremental recurrent cost under the project is $0.5 \nmillion per year. The annual government contribution is 16% of the DGTVET recurrent budget. \nThe government\u2019s annual commitment to the project is deemed affordable. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  Financial management systems are sound, and the MLVT has experience in managing \nADB disbursements. While the MLVT has the capacity to implement the program, it will face \nchallenges in planning and budgeting within a decentralized TVET system. Considerable work \nremains on setting specific targets and indicators for rolling 3-year periods and continuously \nmonitoring progress against targets related to specific TVET programs. Capacity building for \nfinancial management is critical to the sustained delivery of TVET. Governance challenges \nrelate to (i) financial accountability within a decentralized TVET system, (ii) budget flow, (iii) \ncapacity for budget allocation, and (iv) lack of monitoring and evaluation of program progress \n                                                \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nand budget impact. There is a need for clarity on budgets, fund flows, and expenditures at the \nprovincial and regional levels, and at public TVET institutions. Such information would inform \ncost norms and unit costs to facilitate accurate budget planning and resource utilization.  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MLVT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  Poverty.  The  program  prioritizes  skills  development  among  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged.26 Increased  access  to  TVET  will  lift  labor  productivity  and  lead  to  higher \nincomes, thus reducing poverty. Policy actions under the program will ensure equitable access \nto formal TVET through the introduction of the VSC and more qualified Cambodians entering \nformal TVET programs through the RPLCC process. Project interventions will provide stipends \nfor disadvantaged youth and women to attend formal TVET programs. Training proposals for \nstipends from public TVET institutions will include beneficiaries from poor households identified \nby the Ministry of Planning\u2019s Identification of Poor Households Program (IDPoor). Given that a \nlarge proportion of the labor force remains employed in the agricultural sector, the project will \nenhance the VSTP. The SBP will be enhanced to reflect competency-based training principles \nto support the entry of out-of-school youth into formal TVET. Social marketing of TVET will build \nawareness of TVET and employment opportunities among poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n32.  Gender. The program is categorized as gender equity theme.27 It will increase female \nenrollment, retention and completion of formal TVET, and enhance workplace readiness. The \ngender action plan ensures that (i) 30% of those receiving stipends for training at CQF levels 2 \nto 4 are female, (ii) 20% of females receiving stipends for training at CQF levels 2 to 4 are \nenrolled in nontraditional areas, (iii) 120 women enrolled in training programs at CQF levels 2 to \n4 and living in dormitories receive monthly career mentoring, (iv) 40% of the 200 Cambodian \nyouths participating in the competency assessment pilot program are female, and (v) 30% of the \napproximately 9,000 students trained at CQF levels 1 to 4 by RTCs and PTCs are female.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nC for involuntary resettlement and B for indigenous peoples. Civil works will involve small-scale \nconstruction, including three women\u2019s dormitories, one classroom building, and nine workshops. \nAll construction will be within existing TVET facilities on government-owned land. The MLVT will \nprovide ADB with an involuntary resettlement screening for subprojects involving construction to \nensure compliance with ADB safeguard policies. The program is expected to have beneficial \nimpacts on indigenous peoples in border provinces. An indigenous peoples plan has been \ndeveloped to improve the distribution of benefits to indigenous peoples.28 \n \n34.  Environment.  The program is classified category B for environment. Environmental \nimpacts are limited to the construction phase. An initial environmental examination,29 which sets \nout mitigation and monitoring measures, has been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. \n                                                \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  While  government  is  committed  to  improving  financial  management  for  TVET \ndevelopment, a number of TVET sector financial management issues are assessed as high \nwithout mitigation, including the lack of TVET recurrent budget, and the level of resources \nrequired  to  implement  the  draft  TVET  strategic  plan,  2014\u20132018.  Policy  dialogue  will  be \npromoted with the MLVT and the Ministry of Economy and Finance on these issues. Other high \nrisks include (i) significant off-budget funding, and (ii) weak financial management capacity \namong public TVET institutions. A proposed technical assistance will support DGTVET capacity \ndevelopment for sector planning and budgeting. Provincial level risks will be mitigated through \ncapacity development of administrators of public TVET institutions. A potential corruption issue \ninvolving unclear roles and responsibilities of provincial level TVET authorities was assessed as \na high risk without mitigation. Policy dialogue will be promoted with the MLVT and the National \nCommittee for Subnational Democratic Development to define the roles and responsibilities of \nthe Provincial Training Board in the development of the formal TVET system. The overall risk is \nmedium  with  mitigation  measures.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n36.  The government and the MLVT have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. The government and the MLVT have agreed with ADB on certain program \ncovenants, which are set forth in the program and project loan agreements. The loan will not be \ndeclared effective until the government, through the MLVT, has fulfilled all conditions for the \nrelease of the first tranche as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the policy-based loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4,533,000 to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Technical and Vocational Education and Training \nSector Development Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with
