The fund is envisaged to invest in environmental finance in Asia. The fund \nwill use a unique platform that combines private sector investment expertise with development \nfinance  institutions  to  provide  equity,  debt,  and  grant  facilities  to  climate-  and  environment-\nrelated  sectors  in  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). ADB will invest up to 25% in the general partner of the fund, provide extensive services \nunder a service agreement to assist the fund manager in day-to-day operations, and invest as a \nlimited partner in the fund.1  \n \n3. \nInvestment identification. The fund\u2019s concept was initially driven by the interest of a set \nof  large  institutional  investors,  who  view  climate  change  challenges  in  Asia  as  a  compelling \ninvestment  opportunity.  On  four  occasions  during  2007\u20132009,  the  Prince  of  Wales  convened \nsome  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  public  pension  funds,  which  collectively  represent  approximately  \n$3 trillion of assets, with key experts to discuss and develop investment strategies for tackling \nclimate change risks. Inspired by existing and possible models, these investors approached the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  then  ADB  to \ncollaborate  with  them  to  design  an  innovative,  commercially  viable  vehicle  for  climate  and \nenvironmental finance investment in developing Asia.2  \n \n4. \n \nB. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nGeography. The fund will invest in ADB\u2019s DMCs.

Policymakers include \nthe  International  Investors  Group  on  Climate  Change,  the  UNEP  Finance  Initiative,  the  Global  Leadership  for \nClimate  Action,  and  the  Group  of  8  (G8).

ADB will hold up to 25% of the equity shares \nof the general partner. The general partner will delegate responsibility for day-to-day operations \nand  management  of  the  fund  to  the  fund  manager,  as  is  customary.3  The  fund  manager  will \nenter into a service agreement with ADB, pursuant to which ADB will perform certain services \nfor the fund manager. ADB will share day-to-day fund management work and, in consideration \nof the services performed for the fund manager, ADB will be paid a service fee. \n \n9. \n \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \n10. \n \n11. \n \n12. \n \nD. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.   \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n13.  \n \n14. \nADB  investment  history.  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  practice  has  committed  more  than  \n$919  million  to  61  private  equity  fund  investments  in  Asia.  As  of  30  September  2011,  active \ninvestments (vintage years 2001\u20132008) had generated a net return of 9.73% and a multiple of \n1.3  times.  ADB  has  been  making  investments  in  low-carbon  and  resource-efficiency  sectors \nsince 2003, and had committed over $144 million to ten funds as of 30 September 2011. ADB \nfund  investments  that  are  consistent  with  the  fund\u2019s  strategy  have  generated  an  aggregate \nunderlying fund net return of 9.0% as of 30 September 2011. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n15. \nADB will provide (i) a proposed equity investment of up to the lesser of $1,000,000 and \n25%  of  the  shares  in  a  company  to  act  as  the  general  partner  of  the  Climate  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Fund; (ii) a proposed equity investment of up to the lesser of $1,000,000 and 25% \nof the shares in a company to act as the special limited partner of the fund; and (iii) a proposed \nequity investment as a limited partner in the fund of up to the balance of $100 million less the \namounts  contributed  under  items  (i)  and  (ii).  ADB  will  also  contribute  human  resources  to the \nfund  under  the  terms  of  a  service  agreement  to  be  entered  into  between  it  and  the  fund \nmanager.  Each  of  the  investee  companies  (i.e  the  general  partner  and  the  special  limited \npartner  entities)  will  be  formed  after  the  date  of  finalization  of  fund  documentation.  The \nremainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n \n\n                                                           \n3  All of the management and other fees relating to the fund will be paid to the fund manager. \n\n\f3 \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n16.  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nIn keeping  with  its  stake  in  the general  partner  and  to help ensure the fund\u2019s  success, \n17. \nADB  will  take  an  active  role  in  fund  management  with  the  involvement  of  core  and  extended \nteams of ADB staff. At the outset, PSOD will dedicate some of its own staff to the fund initiative; \nadditional staff may be deployed over time as the fund\u2019s investments expand. ADB expects to \nemploy additional staff with funds generated by the management fee it receives via the service \nagreement.4  The remainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive \ninformation. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nThe  fund  initiative  is  designed  around  the  concept  of  a  partnership  between  a  private \nsector fund manager and a public sector development bank, working in concert to execute the \nfund\u2019s  mandate.  The  remainder  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially \nsensitive information.   \n \n19. \n \n20. \n \n21. \n \n22. \n \nD. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nRisks \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n23. \n \n24. \nPipeline.  A  second  risk relates  to deal  flow,  and  whether  the  fund can  develop  a  deal \npipeline of the scale needed to support the fund\u2019s investments. The remainder of this paragraph \nhas been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.     \n \n25. \nExecution  and  resource  allocation.  Risk  is  associated  with  the  ability  to  execute the \nfund\u2019s  mandate  (i.e.,  source,  make,  and  exit  investments;  and  generate  returns  for  the  fund). \nThe remainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n26. \nLimit to liability. The general partner will be a limited liability company, and accordingly, \nits  shareholders  will  have  the  general  protection  provided  by  law  in  respect  of  limited  liability \ncompanies.  ADB  will  ascertain  that  in  the  jurisdiction  of  establishment  of  the  fund  and  the \ngeneral  partner  (which  jurisdiction  must  be  satisfactory  to  ADB)  no  special  or  potentially \nunlimited liability arises as the result of ADB being an investor in the general partner and, at the \nsame time, a limited partner.  \n \n27. \n \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.    \n\n                                                           \n4  Implementation  Arrangements  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  provides  further \n\ninformation on the funding arrangements.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutputs and outcome. The key output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of \n28. \nthe  fund.  The  outcome  will  be  an  increased  number  of  profitable,  well-governed,  and \nenvironmentally  responsible  investee  companies  and  funds  in  environmental  finance.  The \nremainder of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n29. \n \nB. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due \n\n30. \nto \ncommercially sensitive information.  As such, they are aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which \nseeks  to reduce  poverty  and  improve  living  conditions  and quality  of  life  by scaling  up  private \nsector  development  and  supporting  environmentally  sustainable  models  through  projects  that \naim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change impacts.5   \n  \n31. \nConsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  climate  change  priorities.  ADB  recently  emphasized  the \nimportance of technology transfer and diffusion, one of the identified key \"building blocks\" under \ninternational climate change negotiations, to help address  energy security and climate change \nin  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  President's  advisory  group  on  climate  change  and  sustainable \ndevelopment  has  strongly  backed  these  efforts.  The  advisory  group  also  emphasized  ADB's \npotential  catalytic  role  and  urged  ADB  to  help  the  region  to  move  \"from  the  abstract  to  the \nconcrete\"  and from  incubation  to  impact.  The  remainder  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted \ndue to commercially sensitive information.   \n \n32. \n \n33. \nConsistency  with  the  energy  sector  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  2009  Energy  Policy  seeks  to \nfacilitate a transition to a low-carbon economy and universal access to energy as an important \nstep toward achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. The objective of the policy is to \nhelp  the  DMCs  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  for  inclusive  growth  in  a \nsocially,  economically,  and  environmentally  sustainable  way.  To  achieve  these  goals,  policy \nimplementation will be based in part on private sector participation to improve energy efficiency \nthrough competition and an increase in investable resources in the DMCs, which is necessary to \nbuild and sustain low-carbon infrastructure. \n \n34. \nConsistency  with  previous  operations.  ADB  recently  invested  in  eight  clean  energy \nfunds.  The  remainder  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation. \n \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n35. \n\nThe  investment  is  classified  under  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \n\n                                                           \n5  ADB.  2008.

The fund \nwill  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  are  in  compliance  with  applicable  national  laws \nand  regulations;  apply  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  including  the  prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list;  and  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  to  manage  the  impacts  and  risks  adequately.7  Gender  aspects  of  the \ninvestment  and  the  fund\u2019s  compliance  with  core  labor  standards  were  considered  and  agreed \nactions will be monitored during implementation. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \n36. \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n37. \nThe  proposed  transaction,  once  approved  and  signed,  will  increase  ADB's  projected \nnonsovereign  exposure  as  of  31  December  2012  to  $6.02  billion.  Additionally,  the  proposed \ntransaction  will  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  to  the  PRC  to  $1.42  billion  or  24%  of  total \nnonsovereign  exposure,  increase  exposure  to  India  to  $881.7  million  or  15%  of  total \nnonsovereign  exposure,  and  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  to  private  equity  funds  to  $744 \nmillion or 12% of total nonsovereign exposure. The proposed transaction is within the medium-\nterm, country, industry, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. However, the \nproposed  aggregate  capital  contribution  exceeds  the  $75  million  single  obligor  limit  for  equity \ninvestments. This sentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. In this \nrespect, a waiver of the applicable policy is sought.8 \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank,9 each country \n38. \nwhere the fund invests will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment  in  the  fund.
