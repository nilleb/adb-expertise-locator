The  country\u2019s  economic  growth  reached  7%  or  more  each \nyear from 2011 to 2015.1 Official figures show that poverty in Cambodia has fallen dramatically, \nfrom 47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.2 However, the legacy of the civil conflict that devastated \nthe national infrastructure remains. For instance, access to electricity in Cambodia is among the \nlowest in Southeast Asia, despite the rapid economic development. The electrification rate has \nrisen  from  20.3%  in  2007  to  55.0%  in  2015,  but  is  still  not  comparable  with  regional  peers.3 \nConsumers  suffer  from  insufficient,  unreliable,  and  expensive  power  because  of  the  country\u2019s \nreliance  on  diesel  and  energy  imports  as  well  as  fragmented  grids.  On  the  other  hand, \nCambodia\u2019s  energy  demand  is  growing  faster  than  economic  growth  as  a  result  of  increasing \nforeign  investment,  a  shift  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing  and  service  industries,  and  an \nincrease  in  connected  households.  Power  consumption  is  forecast  to  grow  at  9.4%  per  year \nuntil 2020, which will require more than a 50% increase in energy output to keep pace with the \ndemand in growth. Without adequate and reliable supply of electricity at a competitive cost, the \nenergy  deficit  will  be  a  major  obstacle  for  industries  and  a  key  hindrance  to  sustainable  and \ninclusive economic growth. \n \n3. \nSolar is a promising renewable energy resource in Cambodia. The country has abundant \nsupply, with average solar irradiation of 5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter (m2) per day. \nThe  technical  potential  for  solar  power  is  8,100  megawatts  (MW)  and  energy  output  of \n14,781 gigawatt-hours  per  year. 4  However,  solar  energy  is  yet  to  be  utilized  at  scale  in \nCambodia. There are no utility-scale solar power plants, and solar accounts for less than 0.1% \nof  the  energy  mix.  This  is  primarily  because  solar  was  previously  prohibitively  expensive,  and \nCambodia could not afford subsidized feed-in tariffs or other forms of subsidy present in higher-\nincome  countries.  The  high  financing  cost  and  scarcity  of  long-term  commercial  financing \nexacerbated the issue. Secondly, solar and renewable energy were not part of the government\u2019s \nprimary  agenda  for  energy  sector  planning.  The  main  priority  has  been  to  develop  baseload \nplants such as large hydropower and coal projects, and to extend and connect the fragmented \ngrids to establish a national network. \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2016. Basic Statistics 2016. Manila. \n3  Electricity Authority of Cambodia estimates. \n4  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. 2010. The Current Status of Renewable Energy, \n\nEnergy Efficiency Development in Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n\n\f2 \n\nHowever, the landscape is changing, and Cambodia is entering a new era of unlocking \n4. \nits  solar  potential.  With  the  rapid  cost  reduction  in  solar  panels,  and  the  high  cost  of  existing \nenergy  sources  such  as  diesel  and  energy  imports,  solar  power  in  Cambodia  is  reaching  grid \nparity  where  solar  power  can  be generated  at  a  cost  lower  than the country\u2019s  average  cost  of \nproduction and retail tariffs. Once projects achieve grid parity, solar can be sustainable without \nsubsidies,  thereby  satisfying  the  government\u2019s  principle  of  no  subsidy.  The  government  also \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  solar  energy  development  from  energy  shortages  during  the \ncountry\u2019s  dry  season.  An  increasing  number  of  hydropower  plants  accounts  for  45%  of  total \ndomestic energy generation, and these are increasingly vulnerable during times of low rainfall. \nSolar energy is predictable in the dry season when generation from hydropower is constrained, \nand  therefore  complementary  to  hydropower  facilities.  In  June  2016,  the  Government  of \nCambodia received approval from the multi-donor Climate Investment Funds for an investment \nplan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income Countries Program. The program \ninvestment plan in Cambodia includes $21.3 million for solar energy development to accelerate \nsolar power through both the public and private sectors.5 \n \nSvay Rieng Province is located in the southeast of Cambodia, bordering Viet Nam. The \n5. \nprovince  has  special  economic  zones,  with  growing  economic  activities  from  industries,  which \ncreate  over  25,000  jobs.  The  peak  load  in  the  province  has  been  rapidly  increasing from  only \n8.6 MW in 2010 to 14.4 MW in 2015, and is estimated to grow to 23.7 MW by 2020 and 37.1 \nMW by 2024.6 However, the region has not been connected to the national grid to date, and its \nenergy solely depends on import from Viet Nam. The capacity of the substation in Viet Nam is \nonly  40  MW,  which  also  serves  domestic  supply,  so  the  energy  supply  to  Cambodia  is \ninsufficient and unstable. The province faces acute shortage of energy, especially during the dry \nseason.  Unless  generation  capacity  is  added  with  stable  energy  supply,  industrial  activities  in \nthe  special  economic  zones  will  be  hampered  and  residents  in  the  area  will  suffer  from  load \nshedding.  \n \nIn  response  to  the  energy  shortage,  the  government  decided  to  build  a  10  MW  solar \n6. \nplant, the first utility-scale solar plant in the country, by leveraging the abundant solar resource \nin the area. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) tendered out the plant as a private sector \nindependent  power  producer (IPP)  project  in February  2016.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  was  engaged  early  in  the  bidding  process  to  ensure  that  bidders  had  the \nopportunity  to  optimize  their  proposals  by  leveraging  the  involvement  of  international  financial \ninstitutions,  like  ADB,  in  the  nascent  financial  environment  of  Cambodia,  where  commercial \nlong-term  funding  is  still  extremely  scarce  and  perceived  political  risk  is  high.  The  transparent \nbidding  process  resulted  in  a  competitive  and  sustainable  tariff,  and  Sunseap  Group,  the \nwinning bidder, expressed a strong interest in ADB financial assistance. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n7. \nThe  project  is  the  first  utility-scale  solar  power  plant  in  Cambodia,  and  the  first \ncompetitively tendered renewable energy IPP project in the country. It is a build\u2013own\u2013operate, \npublic\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  transaction  for  a  10  MW  solar  power  plant  to  be  located  in \nBavet city in Svay Rieng Province, about 150 kilometers (km) from the capital Phnom Penh. The \nproject  company  has  entered  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  Electricit\u00e9  du \nCambodge (EDC), a state-owned utility. The project will construct a 5.5 km transmission line to \n\n                                                \n5  Government  of  Cambodia.  2016.

Ltd. (Sunseap Asset), a \nspecial-purpose project company incorporated in Cambodia. It will be 51% owned by Sunseap \nInternational  Pte.  Ltd.  (Sunseap  International),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Sunseap  Group \nPte.  Ltd.  (Sunseap  Group),  a  pioneering  and  leading  solar  energy  system  developer  in \nSingapore;  and  49%  by  SchneiTec  Co.  Ltd.  (SchneiTec),  a  Cambodian  solar  developer  and \nmajor distributor of Schneider solar products in Cambodia. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n9. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  increase  the  electricity  supply  to  meet  the  demand,  address \nthe  problem  of  imbalance of  electricity  supply  between the  dry  and wet  seasons,  and  improve \nthe  reliability  and  stability  of  Cambodia\u2019s  power  supply.  It  will  also  contribute  to  more \nelectrification of villages and households. As the first competitive tender for a renewable energy \nIPP and as the first utility-scale solar project in Cambodia, the project  will mark a milestone in \nterms of transparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and clean energy. \n \n10. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  renewable  energy  capacity  and  sustainable \nprovision  of  competitively  priced,  reliable  electricity  by  the  private  sector.  The  much-needed \nadditional  capacity  will  come  from  solar  energy,  which  contributes  to  a  reduction  in  carbon \ndioxide emissions. \n \n11. \nOutputs. The output will be the successful installation of a 10 MW solar power plant and \ngeneration of local employment. The project will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign power generation \nproject in Cambodia. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nConsistency with  ADB  strategy  and country  strategy. The project is consistent with \n12. \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  inclusive  growth  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment  as  two  of  the  four  strategic  priorities  to  sharpen  the  focus  of  ADB  operations.7 \nCapitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  core  strength  of  financing  infrastructure  development,  the  review  sets \nforth that ADB will continue to help expand the supply of energy, promote energy efficiency, and \nsupport  clean  energy.  It  aims  to  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  financing \ninfrastructure development by supporting PPPs. The project is also fully in line with the review\u2019s \nemphasis  on  strengthening  private  sector  operations  in  Asian  Development  Fund  recipient \ncountries,  and  expanding  connectivity.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia, which calls for environmentally sustainable growth, through \nthe use of environment and climate-friendly technologies.8 \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nConsistency  with  the  sector  strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes investments \n13. \nin energy efficiency, renewable energy projects, private sector participation, and wider access to \nenergy.9 It  will  move  ADB  toward  its  target  of  investing  $3  billion  a  year  in  clean  energy  to \naccelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  energy \npolicy  also  supports  PPP  models  that  enable  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  to  help \nachieve efficiencies and reduce reliance on public sector funds. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\n14. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements  The project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, and turnkey EPC \n\nThe project was developed as a private sector independent power producer project, \nand awarded a PPA through an international, least-cost, competitive bidding process \nled by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. \nProject development, construction, and operation will be managed by the borrower, a \nspecial-purpose company incorporated in Cambodia.

There will be subcomponents, including solar panel supply, inverter \nsupply, and civil works subcontracts. \nSchneiTec will be the EPC contractor to wrap the subcomponents. The supplier of the \nphotovoltaic panels will be Canadian Solar, and the inverters will be Schneider. The \ncivil works will be minor and undertaken by local subcontractors. The sponsors will \nextend the completion guarantee in the case of cost overrun or nonperformance by \nthe EPC contractor. \n \n\nO&M requirements for solar farms are straightforward, comprising electrical works, \ncleaning of solar modules, regular inspections, minor repairs, measurements, data \nverification, reporting, and site security. Either SchneiTec or the O&M entity to be \nestablished by the sponsors will undertake the O&M services, and Sunseap has O&M \nexperience as the operator of various solar projects in Singapore. \nEDC is supporting revenue offtake. EDC is a fully state-owned enterprise that has \ngenerated EBITDA of over $100 million since 2013. It has a no-subsidy principle to \nensure its supply cost is lower than the retail tariffs it charges end users, and it has a \nreliable record as an offtaker.  \nThe borrower will report on key performance indicators, including the outcome and \noutputs indicators identified in the design and monitoring framework. \n\nOperations arrangements \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nSupplier and/or contractor \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nRelevant parties \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nEBITDA  =  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization;  EDC  =  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge; \nEPC = engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  kWh  =  kilowatt-hour;  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance; \nPPA = power purchase agreement. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Sunseap Group Pte.

ADB\u2019s \nearly  engagement  in  the  project  and  ability  to  catalyze  long-term  loans  from  an \ninternational commercial bank are important factors in encouraging much-needed \ninvestment and replicating the successful experience. \nADB\u2019s assistance will help support generating indigenous power at a competitive \ncost,  which  offers  an  alternative  to  coal-fired  generation.  Cofinancing  of  the \nconcessional  loan  from  the  CFPS  will  add  financial  viability  and  demonstrative \ncapacity to the landmark solar project and contribute to the objective of the fund \nto  showcase  private  sector-led  clean  energy  development  in  less-developed \ncountries. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRisks \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n17. \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. An initial environmental and social \nexamination (IESE) has been prepared for the project. The IESE includes an environmental and \nsocial  management  plan,  which  the  borrower  will  implement  to  address  the  impacts  and  risks \nassociated  with  the  project.  The  project  site  is  far  from  environment-sensitive  areas  and  is \nlargely surrounded by rice fields. Construction-related impacts such as an increase in dust and \nnoise  levels,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks,  are  expected.  These \nimpacts  are  not  expected  to  be  significant,  given  the  short  duration  of  the  construction  phase \nand  the  availability  of  readily  implementable  mitigation  measures.  A  construction  health  and \n\n \nC. \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nsafety  plan  will  also  be  prepared  and  implemented.  During  operation,  minimal  volume  of \nunderground  water  will  be  used  to  clean  the  panels.  Damaged  panels  will  be  properly  stored \nand packaged for disposal.  \n \nThe  project  has  not  required  involuntary  resettlement;  and  no  distinct  and  vulnerable \n18. \nindigenous peoples groups in the area have the potential to be directly or indirectly affected by \nthe  project.  All  land  required  for  the  project  site  has  been  purchased  from  27  sellers  through \nnegotiated  settlement  on  a  willing-buyer  willing-seller  basis.
