Its nine provinces and two specially administered \nmunicipalities  account  for  more  than  40%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  population,  40%  of  its  freshwater \nresources,  and  about  45%  of  its  economic  output. While  the  YREB,  particularly  in  the  eastern \ndelta area, has benefited from extensive development since the late 1980s, economic growth in \nthe middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin lags behind that of the coastal areas \nand is below its potential. These parts of the YREB still face significant development challenges, \nincluding slow economic diversification. The YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic \nachievement and environmental quality. \n \n4. \nChongqing covers a land area of 82,400 square kilometers and has a population of more \nthan 30 million, of which about 11 million are rural residents. Although Chongqing\u2019s per capita \ngross domestic product (GDP) was slightly above the national average in 2017, it was about half \nto two-thirds that of the YREB eastern delta area.2 Chongqing was developed as one of the main \nindustrial bases of the inland PRC. About 44% of Chongqing\u2019s GDP is derived from the secondary \nindustry, and the share of heavy industries (such as iron and steel, automotive, manufacturing, \nconstruction,  and  chemical  industries)  in  the  economy  is  high.3 Its  resource-based,  inefficient \neconomy is impacting the environment. Chongqing\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP \nwere estimated to be 7.8 tons, compared with Shanghai\u2019s 4.0 tons or Beijing\u2019s 3.5 tons.4 \n \nChongqing\u2019s per capita disposable income for both urban and rural residents was below \n5. \nthe  national  average  in 2017.5 The  gap  in  income  growth  and  industrial development  between \nChongqing and the PRC\u2019s eastern coastal cities led to a massive population out-migration from \nChongqing and caused severe social and economic problems; given the scarcity of matching local \n\n \n\n1  The lower reaches include provinces or municipalities of Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; the middle reaches \ninclude Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi; and the upper reaches include Chongqing, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n2  Government of the PRC, National Bureau of Statistics. 2018. China Statistical Yearbook 2018. Beijing. The per capita \nGDP  of  Chongqing  in  2017  was  CNY63,442,  compared  with  the  national  average  (CNY59,660),  Shanghai\u2019s \n(CNY126,634),  Jiangsu\u2019s  (CNY107,150),  and  Zhejiang\u2019s  (CNY92,057).  Within  Chongqing,  urban\u2013rural  disparities \nexist and the per capita GDPs of 25 of the municipality\u2019s 38 districts and counties were below the national average. \n\n3  Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG). 2018. Chongqing Statistical Yearbook 2018. Chongqing. \n4  World Bank. 2019. Chongqing 2035: Spatial and Economic Transformation for a Global City\u2013Overview. Washington, \n\n5  Footnote 2. The per capita disposable income of Chongqing in 2017 was CNY24,153, compared with the national \naverage of CNY25,974. In 2017, the per capita disposable income of urban residents was CNY32,193 in Chongqing \nand CNY36,396 in the PRC, and that of rural residents was CNY12,638 in Chongqing and CNY13,432 in the PRC. \n\nDC. \n\n \n\n\fjobs in Chongqing, about 4.82 million people from Chongqing left their hometowns and families \nto  seek  work  in  the  coastal  cities  or  outside  of  Chongqing  in  2017.6 The  Chongqing  Municipal \nGovernment (CMG) is under immense pressure and has issued policies and directives to support \nthe  migrant  workers  to  return  to  their  hometown  in  Chongqing  for  employment  and \nentrepreneurship. However, the support mechanisms are still at the pilot stage and Chongqing \nlacks  the  capacity  in  facilitating  the  integration  of  returning  migrants  into  the  labor  market  and \nenhancing their access to public and social services. \n \nChongqing maintained more than 10% economic growth since 2002; however, it slowed \n6. \nto  9.3%  in  2017  and  further  to  6.5%  in  2018  because  of  the  decline  in  the  manufacturing  and \nconstruction industries and insufficient capacity and human capital needed to transform from a \ntraditional  to  an  innovative  economy.  The  CMG  prioritizes  innovation  in  promoting  sustainable \ndevelopment  to  shift  from  heavily  polluting  industries  to  innovation-driven  industries  across  all \neconomic sectors.7 It aims to (i) develop intelligent and big data-related industries as the core for \ninnovation-driven development; (ii) promote key emerging industries such as digital information, \nintelligent manufacturing, and alternative energy; and (iii) modernize traditional pillar industries \nand service industries. However, the skills mismatch between the local human resource supply \nand  industry\u2019s  demand  prevails  because  of  a  lack  of  relevant  education  and  training.  Among \nuniversity or college graduates from Chongqing, only about 65% find employment in Chongqing, \nwith the others mainly finding jobs in the eastern PRC. The economy and industries of Chongqing \nhave been developing through imitation or replication, but the intelligent industry has no model to \nimitate. Chongqing\u2019s innovation level was ranked 19th among 20 major PRC cities.8 \n \n7. \nChongqing  has  steadily  expanded  access  to  higher  education,  which  helps  lay  an \nessential  human  resource  foundation  for  the  development  of  the  YREB\u2019s  upper  reaches. \nHowever, Chongqing\u2019s higher education institutions (HEIs) still face financial challenges; human \nresource  challenges;  and  modern  teaching  and  learning  challenges,  including  the  need  for \nfacilities to introduce and deliver new programs and courses aligned to evolving skills demands \nin the local economy.9 Challenges faced by HEIs that need to be urgently addressed include the \nfollowing:  (i)  outdated  curricula  that  are  not  responsive  to  emerging  industrial  demands; \n(ii) teachers\u2019  lack  of  technical  knowledge,  especially  in  the field  of  emerging  technologies,  and \ntheir lack of hands-on expertise and experience needed to teach more efficiently; (iii) the absence \nof effective institution\u2013industry partnerships; (iv) the lack of modern interdisciplinary programs to \ncultivate  and  nurture  students\u2019  creativity,  especially  in  innovation  and  entrepreneurship;  and \n(v) the  lack  of  facilities  needed  to  train  or  retrain  new  skills  and  to  introduce  innovations  to \nstudents,  local  skilled  workers,  farmers,  and  returning  migrant  workers.  Local  skilled  workers, \nfarmers, and returning migrant workers, in particular, need to continuously update their knowledge \nand  gain  new  skills  to  integrate  modern  technologies  in  their  jobs  to  improve  their  livelihood. \nEducation programs take many years to have an impact; there is, therefore, an urgent need to \ninvest now. \n\n \n\n6  The PRC had a large migrant worker population of 171.85 million in 2017. In the middle and upper reaches of the \nYREB, about 22% of the 389 million total population, or about 86 million laborers, left their hometowns and families \nto seek work in the coastal cities. \n\n7  CMG. 2016. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan Outline for Chongqing\u2019s Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020. \n\n8  Evaluation of China Innovation Cities Research Group. 2016. Report on Evaluation of China Innovation Cities, 2016\u2013\n\nChongqing. \n\n2017. Beijing (in Chinese). \n\n9  As of 2018, Chongqing had 65 regular HEIs. Of these, 25 were academic-track HEIs, including application-oriented \nHEIs  such  as  Chongqing  University  of  Science  and  Technology  (CUST)  and  Chongqing  University  of  Education \n(CUE); and 40 were tertiary technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, including Chongqing \nVocational Institute of Engineering (CVIE) (a national demonstration institution) and Chongqing Sanxia Vocational \nCollege (CSVC) (the only tertiary TVET institution specializing in agriculture in the YREB). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fIndustries are striving to shift to less-polluting and efficient operations through research \n8. \nand development (R&D). However, despite high returns, there is underinvestment in long-term, \nhigh-risk R&D activities because of limited private financial resources. Public investment in R&D \nis  a  crucial  catalyst  to  boosting  private  R&D  activities,  innovations,  long-term  productivity,  and \neconomic growth. Chongqing aims to create an enabling and inclusive economic environment by \nproviding public services assistance at an early stage for R&D and start-ups. Chongqing lacks \nthe  capacity  to  support  business  incubation;  institution\u2013industry  partnerships;  mentorships  for \nentrepreneurs  and  job  seekers,  including  returning  migrant  workers;  intermediary  services  on \nlegal, finance, or intellectual property; and spaces for networking and collaboration. \n \n9. \nWomen made up 48.6% of the total population in Chongqing in 2017. Female students\u2019 \nrepresentation  varies  from  16%  to  70%  in  the  project  HEIs. 10  Education  patterns  remain \nsegregated  along  gender  lines,  with  women  underrepresented  in  engineering,  information \ntechnology, and science and technology studies at all educational levels and in the workforce. \nThe  female  entrepreneurs  in  the  economic  and  technological  development  areas  (ETDAs)  in \nChangshou District and Dianjiang County account for only about 3% of all entrepreneurs in the \nETDAs  in  Changshou  and  Dianjiang.  HEIs\u2019  female  teachers  and  students  lack knowledge  and \nskills in innovation and entrepreneurship as well as the confidence to start their own businesses. \nThe  employment  rate  of  returning  migrants  who  are  female  is  about  20%  lower  than  that  of \nreturning  male  migrants.  Training  programs,  networks,  and  support  targeting  women  are \ninsufficient.  There  is  a  gender  imbalance  in  labor  division\u2014even  when  women  start  their  own \nbusinesses, they are primarily responsible for child and elderly care and housework. \n \n10. \nChongqing lacks capacity to help create an enabling \u201cinnovation ecosystem\u201d where HEIs \n(teachers,  students,  researchers,  administrators,  and  managers);  enterprises  (entrepreneurs, \nengineers,  skilled  workers,  returning  migrant  workers);  intermediary  services  (business \nincubators; and professionals on legal, tax, finance, and intellectual property); and government \n(officials, policy makers, advisors) are interconnected and transfer knowledge, ideas, human and \nfinancial capital, and policies to provide an enabling environment for innovation and create jobs \nand benefits for both men and women. People need spaces that facilitate capacity building and \nnetworking to generate new ideas to start businesses. Chongqing also needs to build institutional \ncapacity to manage the planned interdisciplinary capacity building activities. \n \n11. \nStrategic  fit.  The  PRC  formulated  the  YREB  development  plan,  which  (i)  stipulates \ninclusive  green  development  to  shift  from  a  traditional  subsector  approach  to  a  crosscutting \nintegrated  approach  leading  to  a  sustainable  development model;  (ii)  solves  the  challenges  of \nrapid  urbanization;  and  (iii)  serves  as  a  guide  to  socioeconomic  development. 11  The  plan \nenvisages the establishment of an innovative and modern industrial system in the YREB, making \nthe YREB a strategic economic region for national economic and social development by 2030. \nThe PRC also issued the YREB innovation-driven industrial transformation and upgrading plan in \n2016, which identifies obsolete industries and economic activities to be upgraded and diversified \nby YREB cities through entrepreneurial and innovative approaches.12 In this context, the Asian \n\n \n\n10 Project HEIs are selected universities and tertiary technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, \nwhich are Chongqing Jiaotong University (CJU), CSVC, CUE, CUST, and CVIE. The ratio of female students and \nteachers in the project HEIs: 16% and 32% in CJU; 42% and 30% in CSVC; 70% and 56% in CUE; 38% and 40% in \nCUST; and 30% and 40% in CVIE, respectively. \n\n11 Government of the PRC. 2016.

Innovation is one of the key aspects for cities\u2019 \nincreased  competitiveness  and  economic  upgrading  and  growth,  and  cities  are  considered  to  be  the  hubs  for \nproducing innovation. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Government of the PRC have agreed to adopt a framework \napproach  to  strategically  program  ADB\u2019s  lending  support  for  development  initiatives  in  the \nYREB.13 To  promote  sustainable  development  in  the  upper  and  middle  reaches  of  the  YREB, \nADB  has  worked  in  partnership  with  the  central  and  local  governments  under  the  framework \napproach  to  explore  high-quality  development  models  for  replication.  Through  technical \nassistance projects for the YREB, ADB and the government identified two locations in the upper \nreaches  of  the  YREB\u2014Chongqing  and  Ziyang  municipalities\u2014as  suitable  candidates  for  the \npartnership. 14  These  two  municipalities  are  of  different  scales  and  stages  of  development, \nshowcasing the problems that many cities in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are faced \nwith in their economic transition to a high-quality, more inclusive development path. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with five out of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  by  enhancing  (i)  human  development  and  social  inclusion,  (ii)  gender  equality, \n(iii) greenhouse gas emissions reduction, (iv) public service provision, and (v) governance and \ninstitutional capacity for service delivery.15 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s (i) education sector \noperations  plan  by  strengthening  quality,  inclusiveness,  and relevant  skills  in  higher  education \nand contributing to filling labor market gaps; (ii) country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020 by supporting skills development and education; and (iii) country operations business plan \nfor the PRC, 2019\u20132021, which refers to ADB\u2019s contribution to human development to promote \ninnovation  and  improve service  delivery,  and  to create  an  enabling  environment for  innovation \nand  new  industries  to  support  the  green  transformation  of  the  local  economy. 16 The  project \nsupports the achievement of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals by supporting \n(i)  inclusive  and  quality  education;  (ii)  sustained,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  economic  growth; \n(iii) inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering of innovation; and (iv) empowerment \nof women.17 \n \nLessons.  Key  lessons  from  education  projects  in  the  PRC 18  include  (i) the  need  to \n13. \nestablish  a  supportive  environment  for  promoting  institution\u2013industry  cooperation, 19  and \n(ii) promotion  of  sustained  ownership  and  leadership  of  schools  and  institutions  for  smooth \nimplementation  of  activities  and  ensuring  sustainability.  Lessons  from  past  and  ongoing  ADB \nprojects in Chongqing include (i) working with the experienced Chongqing project management \noffice  (CPMO)  at  the  municipal  level  to  coordinate  implementing  agencies,  and  (ii)  delegating \n\n \nof  China. \n\n13 ADB. \n\nPeople\u2019s  Republic \n\nProjects. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/50343-001/main.

The project will have the following outcome: \nemployment opportunities and people\u2019s capacity for innovation in Chongqing strengthened.20\n\nThe project will work with seven subprojects managed by seven implementing agencies \n15.\nin Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem to pilot interventions.21 To support Chongqing\u2019s innovation-\ndriven  economic  transformation,  by  2027  the  project  will  enable  8,000  graduates,  including  at \nleast 25% women, to gain employment within Chongqing in strategic emerging industries, and at \nleast  600  skilled  technicians,  including  at  least  25%  women,  working  in  enterprises  and  R&D \ninstitutions  in  Changshou  and  Dianjiang  ETDAs  to  gain  improved  skills  on  entrepreneurship. \nInclusiveness is the main feature of the project, as it considers vulnerable groups in society that \nare most affected in Chongqing\u2019s economic transformation, including unskilled workers, returning \nmigrants,  farmers,  and  women.  The  project\u2019s  activities  for  these  groups  demonstrate  the  key \nfeatures of an inclusive innovation ecosystem model. The project will contribute significantly to \ninstitutional strengthening and project sustainability.\n\nOutput  1:  Relevance  and  quality  of  higher  education  and  vocational  training \n16.\nstrengthened.  The  project  will  educate  female  and  male  professionals  by  2026  to  have \ninnovation-oriented skills and mind-sets, and promote entrepreneurial culture in project HEIs. Five \nsubprojects  with  five  HEIs\u2014Chongqing  Jiaotong  University  (CJU),  Chongqing  University  of \nEducation (CUE), Chongqing University of Science and Technology (CUST), Chongqing Sanxia \nVocational  College  (CSVC),  and  Chongqing  Vocational  Institute  of  Engineering  (CVIE)\u2014will \ndeliver output 1 through capacity development activities and provision of equipment and facilities \nto support the activities. Capacity development activities under the five subprojects will include\n(i) developing  or  updating  courses  that  address  the  emerging  needs  for  \u201cgreen  skills\u201d  and\napplication of cutting-edge technologies to educate at least 30,000 students;22 (ii) developing the\nabilities  of  at  least  1,000  teachers,  including  women,  to reform teaching  resources  and  deliver\nnew courses to cultivate student\u2019s industry-relevant and innovation-oriented skills; (iii) reforming\neducation to build innovative and entrepreneurial skills by creating interdisciplinary collaboration\nmechanisms within HEIs and with industries, and by encouraging students, including women, to\nparticipate  in  skills  contests;  (iv) providing  lifelong  learning  opportunities to meet  the  skills  and\nknowledge  needs  for  at  least  60,000  local  skilled  workers  and  farmers,  including  women;  and\n(v) conducting programs such as knowledge exchanges and study visits.

The  project  will  work  with  two  subprojects\u2014one  in  Changshou  (under  the \nmanagement  of  the  Changshou  EDTA)  and  one  in  Dianjiang  (under  the  management  of  the \nDianjiang  ETDA)\u2014to  deliver  output  2  by  2026  through  capacity  development  activities  and \nprovision  of  equipment  and  facilities  to  support  the  activities.  The  project  will  support \n(i) diversifying  and  modernizing  Chongqing\u2019s  economy  into  a  sustainable  and  innovative  one; \n(ii) creating job opportunities for women and men by offering demonstration testbeds to develop \nnew  sustainable  and  competitive  industries,  business  incubation  platforms,  and  intermediary \nservices to transform ideas into products; and (iii) supporting local workers and returning migrants\u2019 \nneeds  for  skills  development  and  support.  The  subprojects\u2019  capacity  development  activities \ninclude (i) development of two one-stop stations offering public services relating to business start-\nups, job opportunities, and social services (including for women); (ii) development and provision \nof at least eight training programs and mentorships to small- and medium-sized enterprises and \nfemale and male R&D personnel on innovation and entrepreneurship; and (iii) development and \nprovision of training and mentorships to returning migrants, including at least 200 women, on skills \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship. To support the capacity development activities, the project \nwill provide (i) equipment and facilities that will be used for R&D as well as for cooperation and \ncollaboration to operationalize new research ideas into practice; and (ii) social and public service \nareas (e.g., one-stop stations and a daycare center for children) that support the needs of workers, \nentrepreneurs, and women. The facilities will be open to the public regularly to be demonstrated \nas green and inclusive innovation hubs. \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Institutional and project management capacity enhanced. The project will \nprovide support by 2026 to the institutional and capacity development of the CMG, CPMO, local \ngovernments,  and  implementing  agencies,  including  women,  to  (i)  perform  high-quality  project \nmanagement,  monitoring,  and  reporting  activities  following  ADB  procedures  and  guidelines; \n(ii) ensure  the  quality  of  facilities\u2019  design,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance; \n(iii) enhance  project  management  knowledge  and  skills  on  innovation  and  entrepreneurial \nactivities in HEIs and ETDAs by participating in training and domestic and overseas study visits; \nand (iv) pilot green and human-centered facilities on HEI campuses and in ETDAs. \n \nC. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  initial  proposal  for  industrial  transformation  has  been  a  conventional \n19. \nconstruction-based  approach.  ADB  had  numerous  consultations  with  the  CMG  and  local \ngovernments to encourage them to think differently to tackle their development needs, helping \nthem recognize the potential for improving their capacity in promoting relevant economic sectors \nin  Chongqing  and  the  YREB. 24  ADB\u2019s  involvement  changed  stakeholders\u2019  mind-set  and \nintroduced concepts of an innovation ecosystem and innovation and entrepreneurship education \nbased on best practice learned during the project preparation. The Government of the PRC and \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n23 A  \u201cliving  laboratory\u201d  is  a  place  where  students  and  faculty  come  together  to  generate  new  ideas  for  green  and \nsustainable  development.  The  facility  itself  demonstrates  its  green  performance  by  displaying  its  environmental \nperformance; and students, faculty, and visitors creates the space. The living laboratory is an emerging concept, \nwhich universities in the United States and Europe adopt, followed by the developing member countries including \nthe PRC. L. Verhoef and M. Bossert. 2019. The University as a Living Lab for Sustainability: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide \nand Handbook. Delft and Stuttgart: Delft University of Technology, Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik Stuttgart. \n\n24 ADB, with support from Cities Development Initiative for Asia, organized a knowledge workshop in May 2018 with \ninternational  and  national  experts,  which  concluded  that  human  capital  development  is  the  key  to  achieving \nChongqing\u2019s green transformation goals. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fthe CMG have issued various policies and guidelines for industrial transformation and innovation, \nbut  their  implementation  has  been  a  challenge  because  of  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the \nconcept. Without the ADB project, different players in Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem would \nnot have the opportunity to work collaboratively across industries and sectors, which is necessary \nto catalyze inclusive green industrial transformation. \n \n20. \nThe programs and courses to be developed and introduced at the project HEIs will focus \nmostly  on  emerging  engineering  and  technology  fields  that  contribute  to  green  industrial \ntransformation such as smart agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing; intelligent transportation \nusing alternative energy sources; and safety education that will help reduce industrial pollution \nand workplace-related accidents. HEIs will adopt advanced equipment in their new education and \ntraining  programs,  including  big  data,  virtual  reality,  automatic  control,  and  three-dimensional \nprinting.  New  courses  to  be  introduced  will  adopt  interdisciplinary  mechanisms  by  integrating \neducation for innovation through close partnerships between institutions and industries. \n \n21. \nFrom  the  early  project  preparation,  ADB  assessed  the  project\u2019s  social  inclusiveness. \nChongqing\u2019s unique socioeconomic situation requires support for returning migrant workers and \ntheir  families,  existing  workers  and  farmers,  and  women.  Through  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the \nproject design, the project became socially inclusive by extending support to various underserved \nplayers in Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem. This includes (i) supporting capacities of teachers \nto  educate  students  to  address  social  issues;  (ii)  providing  lifelong  learning  opportunities  to \nprovide local workers, farmers, and returning migrants with new skills or bring their existing skills \nup to date; (iii) reducing out-migration and revitalizing areas in industrial decline; (iv) encouraging \nfemale students, workers, and teachers to participate in emerging industries and entrepreneurial \nactivities; and (v) providing support to meet the needs of women, men, children, and families. \n \n22. \nIt  is  essential  that  the  project  facilities  are  not  only  designed  but  also  constructed, \noperated, and maintained to ensure their environmental performance. With ADB\u2019s intervention, \nthe project design will consider resource efficiency and environmental protection, buildings\u2019 life \ncycle,  human-centered  design,  and  integration  of  technology.  Facilities  will  apply  building \ninformation modeling and adopt intelligent systems to monitor, manage, and display the project \nfacilities\u2019  performance.25 The  human-centered  design  promotes  a  healthy  environment,  reflects \nwomen\u2019s  needs,  and  encourages  networking  among  people  to  exchange  ideas  that  promote \ninnovation. The project will provide support throughout the design, construction, and operation \nand maintenance stages to ensure quality. \n \nKnowledge  sharing.  During  project  implementation,  various  available  knowledge \n23. \nplatforms will be utilized to disseminate the knowledge and good practices gained from the project \nwithin the PRC and with Asia and the Pacific. A portion of the courses developed under the project \nwill be made available online for sharing with other HEIs nationally and interested institutions in \nother  developing  member  countries  of  ADB.  The  implementing  agencies  agreed  to  open  the \nproject  facilities  to  the  public  regularly  to  demonstrate  and  let  people  experience  the  (i)  living \nlaboratories for education for sustainable development, and (ii) green innovation hubs. \n\n \n\n25 Building information modeling (BIM) is a process that enables integration of a built environment project on multiple \ndimensions,  including  spatial,  cost,  sequencing,  and  life  cycle  information  and  collaboration  among  developers, \ndesigners, contractors, fabricators, and operators. This increases the efficiency and sustainability of projects. The \nPRC has issued guiding opinions to promote the use of BIM to modernize and transform the construction industry, \nbut BIM\u2019s application beyond the spatial design needs further development.

The  project  design  complies  with  the  PRC\u2019s  guidelines  and  local \nregulations and considers resource efficiency and environmental protection, buildings\u2019 life cycle, \nhuman-centered  design,  and  integration  of  technology.  The  recommended  technologies  are \ninexpensive and suitable for Chongqing\u2019s climate. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment \nfound  that  subproject  sites  would  have  medium  risk  to  climate  change  impact,  and  the \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nimplementing agencies will ensure that the detailed project designs incorporate the adjustments \nto engineering designs derived from assessment results as proactive adaptation measures. Anti-\nflooding  designs  and  evacuation  devices  are the  principal  measurements to  mitigate  predicted \nclimate events. All project facilities shall achieve the PRC energy efficiency standards. The project \nwill save 6,425 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year compared with the baseline scenario. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic.  The  economic  analysis  indicated  that  all  the  subprojects  are  economically \n30. \nviable, each with a positive economic net present value, and with economic internal rates of return \nabove  the  minimum  required  threshold  for  ADB  social  sector  projects  of  9%. 28  The  overall \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is estimated at 11.6%. The economic benefits from \nthe  project  will  mainly  flow  from  the  (i)  additional  job  opportunities  in  research  institutions  and \nenterprises, (ii) increased productivity in the project ETDAs, and (iii) increased numbers of HEI \ngraduates  who  will  secure  a  job  sooner.29 Additional  revenue  will  be  generated  from  the  new \nfacilities,  and  resource  cost  savings  are  expected  because  of  the  project\u2019s  high-quality  green \ndesign and implementation mechanisms. Cost savings on industrial accidents averted are also \nexpected from the project. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the economic viability of the project \nand its subprojects is robust to negative scenarios examined, such as delayed benefit accrual, \nbenefit reduction, and increased recurrent costs. \n \n31. \nFinancial.  Financial  analysis  was  conducted  to establish  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability \nand sustainability.30 For the revenue-generating subprojects, the financial internal rate of return \nwas  compared  to  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  to  assess  viability.  The  Changshou \nsubproject is financially viable with a financial internal rate of return of 3.4%, which exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.0%. The Dianjiang subproject and all HEI subprojects31 are \nfinancially sustainable because the projected revenue exceeds the incremental cost. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  financial  sustainability  analysis  shows  that  the  fiscal  burden  of  the  subprojects  in \nrelation  to  the  respective  government  budget  is  negligible.  This  suggests  that  the  financial \nrequirements of the subprojects are affordable for their respective implementing agencies and are \nfinancially sustainable. The CMG has assured ADB that it will provide the necessary counterpart \nfunding to cover the project\u2019s operation and maintenance costs and debt service repayments, in \ncase any of the institutions fail to fulfill their financing requirements. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment confirmed that the CMG \nand  the  seven  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to \nimplement  the  project.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate,  mainly  because  of \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  disbursement \nrequirements and procedures. The risks will be mitigated by the early engagement of a financial \nmanagement consultant and the provision of training.

Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The  full  economic  benefits  of  the  project  are  expected  to  be  significantly  higher,  as  the  analysis  excludes  some \nindirect economic and ecological benefits that are not easily quantifiable, such as quality improvements, production \ncost reductions, reduced skill search costs, improved innovation capacity, and improved working conditions. \n\n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Subprojects of CJU, CSVC, CUE, CUST, and CVIE. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nwith the CMG is described in the PAM (footnote 26) and will be closely monitored during project \nimplementation. \n \n34. \nProcurement. Value for money will be achieved through contract packaging, selection of \nprocurement method and bidding procedure, and proposed advance procurement arrangement; \nthese  were  the  result  of  a  strategic  procurement  planning  exercise  that  took  into  account  the \nstrategic project priorities, risks and opportunities, operating conditions of the borrowers, and the \nmarket conditions. The overall procurement risk is medium. Measures to mitigate the risks are in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted. 33 No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified. \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  CMG,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nE. \n \n36. \nA total 311,924 people will benefit from the project, comprising 151,522 direct beneficiaries \n(42% women and 3% poor) and 160,402 indirect beneficiaries (51% women and 3% poor). The \nproject will (i) improve students\u2019 capacity and employability in the labor market through access to \nquality teaching, practices, and a better learning environment in the HEIs; (ii) address supply and \ndemand  gaps  in  education  and  emerging  business  sectors;  (iii)  enhance  teachers\u2019  capacity  to \nintegrate an innovative and entrepreneurial approach into their teaching; (iv) facilitate returning \nmigrants\u2019  reintegration  into  the  labor  market  and  enhance  their  access  to  public  and  social \nservices;  (v) establish  a  support  system  for  children  in  difficult  situations,  including  migrant \nworkers\u2019  left-behind  children,  through  relevant field  research, teachers\u2019 capacity  enhancement, \nand social work service development; and (vi) make the project area economically vibrant through \nthe  promotion  of  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  and  close  cooperation  among  HEIs, \nenterprises,  and  ETDAs.  The  project  is  estimated  to  create  about  5,050  jobs  during  the \nconstruction and operation phases for local people, including 4,820 skilled jobs (27% women) and \n230 non-skilled jobs (48% women). A social and gender action plan (SGAP) was prepared and \nits implementation will be monitored.34 \n \n37. \nThe project is categorized gender equity theme and will significantly benefit women\u2014who \nare disadvantaged in the labor market\u2014mainly because of imbalanced gender labor division in \nthe household. It will directly address women\u2019s skills development and employment by narrowing \ngender  disparities  through  access  to  social  services,  economic  and  financial  resources,  and \nopportunities. The project will benefit and empower women by enhancing women\u2019s skills to make \nthem more competitive in the labor market, encouraging their participation in economic activities \noutside the home, and supporting them in organizing their children\u2019s care and education in newly \nestablished daycare centers. In the project HEIs, female teachers and students will benefit from \nthe  improved  teaching\u2013learning  facilities,  new  training  opportunities,  and  capacity  building  on \ninnovation and entrepreneurship. The project will provide training programs for women; establish \nwomen\u2019s  associations  to  facilitate  communication  relating  to  innovation  policies  and  support \nprograms; and create employment opportunities for returning migrants and local people, including \nwomen with lower education and skills but with a high burden in looking after their family. \n\n \n\n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2003.

An  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  were  prepared  for  the  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  Potential  environmental  impacts  include \n(i) dust, noise, soil runoff, and tree cutting during construction; (ii) temporary traffic disturbances \nbecause of transportation of construction materials; (iii) risks to community and workers\u2019 health \nand  safety  during  construction;  and  (iv)  wastewater  and  solid  waste  generated  during  the \nconstruction and operation. The EMP defines mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and \ninstitutional responsibilities to ensure proper environmental management throughout construction \nand operation. The environmental management capabilities of the executing and implementing \nagencies were strengthened through on-the-job training and will be further enhanced by capacity \ndevelopment  proposed  under  the  project.  Potential  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  were \nconsulted and their concerns have been incorporated in the project design and will be addressed \nthrough  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  CPMO  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism.  The  executing  agency  will  submit  semiannual  internal  environmental  monitoring \nreports  to  ADB.  An  external  monitor  will  also  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  the \nexecuting agency and ADB. \n \n42. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  will  implement  seven  subprojects \nwith five HEIs and two ETDAs, and involve 409.9 mu of land acquisition and 10,500 square meters \nof house demolition.36 Five of the seven subprojects have completed their land acquisition, and \ntheir  due  diligence  confirmed  that  there  are  no  past  or  present  concerns  and  outstanding \ngrievances  on  involuntary  resettlement.37 The  subproject  at  CUE  will  not  result  in  resettlement \n\n \n\n35 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n36 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n37 These five subprojects (at Changshou, CJU, CSVC, CUST, and CVIE) involved land acquisition of 339.4 mu and \n\nhouse demolition of 10,500 square meters. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fimpacts.  The  Dianjiang  subproject  will  acquire  70.5  mu  of  rural  collective  lands  and  affect \n111 households  with  511  persons,  but  will  not  involve  demolition  of  houses,  shops,  and \ninstitutions. Income loss impacts have been assessed as less than 10% for 110 of the 111 affected \nhouseholds.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  Dianjiang  subproject,  and  key \ninformation  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  due  diligence  report  were  disclosed  to  the  affected \npersons. During implementation, training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement will be provided to \nthe CPMO and implementing agencies. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, \nand an external agency will be engaged for semiannual resettlement monitoring. \n \n43. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project locations do not have a concentration of \nethnic minority people.38 In the project\u2019s five HEIs, about 5%\u20139% of students are ethnic minorities, \nof  which  about  60%\u201390%  are  Tujia  and  Miao  people  from  Chongqing  who  speak  Chongqing \ndialect and are socioeconomically mainstreamed with the Han people. No adverse impact by the \nproject on ethnic minorities is envisaged. \n \nG. \n \n44. \nThere are no high or substantial risks to this project. The overall risk assessment of the \nproject is moderate, and the benefits and impact are expected to outweigh the costs. The risks, \nwhich  are rated  either moderate  or  low,  and  the mitigation measures  are  described  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 32). \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe  government  and  CMG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n45. \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.

Although  the  project  aims  to \nempower women and female students, changing mind-sets needs time. Achieving the same percentage of female \nstudents (as male students) who are trained to get jobs in strategic emerging industries is still challenging, as the \nproject cannot force women or female students to take certain jobs, or employers to employ women. However, the \nproject will significantly contribute to an increase in the number of women entering into strategic emerging industries. \ne  At  the  early  stage  of  project implementation,  the  executing  and  implementing agencies, supported  by  the project \n\nmanagement consultants, will develop detailed definition and methodologies to measure performance. \n\nf  The female baseline ratios are proxies estimated through consultations with the CPMO and implementing agencies. \n\nExact baselines will be obtained at the early stage of the implementation. \n\ng  Gender-inclusive facilities are facilities that consider the specific needs of women and men, e.g., adequate lighting \n\nfor safety, separate toilet facilities (with disabled-friendly features), and children\u2019s daycare centers. \n\nContribution to the Asian Development Bank Results Framework: \nRFI  A:  Jobs  generated.
