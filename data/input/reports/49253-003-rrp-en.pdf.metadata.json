The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  the  Power  Sector  Reform  and  Sustainability  Support \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the TA.  \n \n2. \nThe project will (i) help Uzbekistan address the widening electricity demand\u2013supply gap \nby installing additional 900 megawatt (MW) generation capacity in a least-cost and most efficient \nmanner  through  combined  cycle  gas  turbine  units  (CCGT)  at  the  existing  Talimarjan  thermal \npower plant (TPP); and (ii) complement and deepen ongoing sector reforms, strengthen financial \nmanagement  practices,  and  improve  the  corporate  governance  of  Uzbekenergo,  the  largest \npower utility of Uzbekistan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nOver the past decade, the Uzbekistan economy grew robustly at an average rate of 8%, \n3. \nlifting a significant number of people out of poverty.1 The energy sector underpins Uzbekistan\u2019s \nsustained growth, contributing to 10% of its gross domestic product and a quarter of its exports. \nHowever, Uzbekistan is also one of the most energy-intensive economies in the world. Its aging \nand dilapidated Soviet era energy and industrial infrastructure is a major factor for the prevailing \npoor  energy  efficiency.  Lack  of  adequate  investments  in  new  power  plants  is  inhibiting  the \nretirement  of  old  and  inefficient  power  plants  (para.  4).  Uzbekistan  has  adopted  an  ambitious \nprogram to pursue an industrialized, upper middle-income country status by 2030 (Vision 2030).2 \nEnergy sector modernization and reforms are the centerpiece of this vision.   \n \n4. \nUzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbon resources with large proven reserves of about 1.8 trillion \ncubic meter of natural gas, 600 million barrels of oil, and 3 billion tons of coal. The primary energy \nconsumption of Uzbekistan is dominated by natural gas, which provides 82% of its energy mix.3 \nUzbekistan is the eighth largest producer of natural gas in the world. In 2016, it produced more \nthan 62 billion cubic meters of natural gas, of which 20% was exported.4 Natural gas is also the \ndominating fuel in the country\u2019s electricity generation mix, contributing 85% of the total electricity \nproduced in 2016 (59 terawatt-hours [TWh]).5 The installed generation capacity in the country is \n13.4 gigawatts, of which more than 11 gigawatts is fueled by natural gas TPPs. However, more \nthan 40% of this capacity is in 40\u201350 years old plants, which are in poor condition and require \nurgent replacement and/or major rehabilitation.  \n\n                                                \n1   Based on yearly Basic Statistics (ADB), the portion of population below the national poverty line has declined steadily \n\nfrom 27.5% in 2002 to 12.8% in 2015.   \n\n2  Government of Uzbekistan. 2015. Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No UP-4707 dated 4 March \n2015 on the Program of Measures to Promote Structural Reforms, Modernization and Diversification of Production \nin  2015\u20132019.  Tashkent;  and  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.  Decree  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan No UP-4947 dated 7 February 2017 on the Strategy of Actions on Further Development of Uzbekistan. \nTashkent. \n\n3   Oil (10%), hydropower (5%), and coal (3%) are other primary energy sources in the energy mix.  \n4   Based on estimates in the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2017.  \n5   Total electricity generation was 47.2 TWh in 2003 and 51.1 TWh in 2010. \n\n \n\n\fThe weighted average thermal efficiency of its gas-based thermal power generation \n5. \nfleet  is  33%,  and  some  plants  have  efficiencies  as  low  as  23%,6 compared  with  modern \nCCGTs  with  thermal  efficiencies  of  53%\u201360%. 7  Uzbekistan  has  more  than  230,000 \nkilometers  of  transmission  and  distribution  lines  with  an  average  age  of  30  years. \nTransmission and distribution losses are high at more than 20%.   \n \n6. \n Aging infrastructure and insufficient investments have increasingly resulted in unreliable \npower supply in recent years. The World Bank estimates the electricity supply\u2013demand gap at \n2,085 gigawatt-hours in 2016, and to reach 14,624 gigawatt-hours by 2020 if required investments \nare not made. Blackouts are still occasional for  4\u20136 hours a day during winter when electricity \ndemand is highest in both rural areas and big cities. Hardest hit are the socially vulnerable people \nin  the  southern  and  western  regions  of  Uzbekistan.  Schools  and  hospitals  are  unable  to  fully \noperate in late autumn and winter because of the lack of reliable electricity, putting education and \nhealth care systems at risk. Power shortages are often considered high risk for doing business in \na country where investor interest is eroding.  \n \nUzbekistan is strategically located for power trade with neighboring countries and is the \n7. \nlargest  power  exporter  to  Afghanistan,  supplying  35%  of  its  electricity  demand in 2015.8 In the \ninterconnected and coordinated power system of the Soviet era, Uzbekistan was expected to use \nits fossil fuel generation to make up for autumn and winter power shortages in hydropower-rich \ncountries  such  as  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan.  Improving  efficient  power  generation \ncapacity in Uzbekistan can increase power trade with neighboring countries, improving electricity \nsupply security across Central Asia.   \n \nIn coordination with development partners, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \n8. \nsupporting Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector through a two-pronged strategy of (i) investing in critical \nenergy infrastructure to modernize and upgrade the system and (ii) leveraging incremental sector \nreforms and governance improvement.9 In April 2010, ADB approved the first energy project in \nUzbekistan,  which  included  the  installation  of  900  MW  CCGT  units  at  the  Talimarjan  TPP  in \nsouthern Uzbekistan.10 In August 2017, CCGT units designed to generate 6.5 TWh of electricity \nannually were successfully put into operation, alleviating some of the existing electricity shortages \n(para. 5).11 The reform elements under the Talimarjan Power Project included the introduction of \nfinancial reporting following International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at Uzbekenergo \n(footnote 10), a vertically integrated stated-owned enterprises (SOE) for thermal power generation \nincluding Talimarjan TPP, transmission and distribution. This helped Uzbekenergo generate its \nfirst IFRS consolidated financial statements for FY2015 and adopt external audits based on the \nInternational  Standards  on  Auditing  starting  FY2011,  contributing  to  improved  accountability, \ntransparency, and good governance.12  \n\n                                                \n6  World Bank. 2013. Uzbekistan Energy/Power Sector Issues Note. Washington, DC. \n7   Substituting  old  plants  with  modern  CCGTs  would  allow  the  country  to  produce  an  additional  40%\u201345%  of  total \ngeneration  from  the  existing  capacity.  The  weighted  average  thermal  efficiency  means  an  average  of  thermal \nefficiency resulting from the multiplication of capacity of each power plant by its efficiency.  \n\n8  Uzbekistan export to Afghanistan in 2016 was about 1,500 GWh or less than 3% of the total electricity produced. \n9   The World Bank is supporting transmission system upgrade and industrial energy efficiency improvements.  \n10  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  and \nAdministration of Loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Talimarjan Power Project. Manila. The proposed project \nis  the  fifth  energy  project  in  Uzbekistan.  ADB  assistance  is  ongoing  for  all  aspects  of  energy  including  power \ngeneration, transmission modernization, and advanced metering project in distribution side. \n\n11  After initial delays in finalizing the turnkey contract for the CCGT units, a complex and high-value procurement, the \n\n12 The submitted IFRS consolidated financial statements for FY2015 are unaudited. An international firm of auditors is \n\nproject was implemented smoothly.    \n\ncurrently performing the audit. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  is  committed  to  reforms  and  liberalization.  In  September  2017,  it \n9. \nannounced  the  bold  and  much-needed  policy  action  to  unify  its  foreign  exchange  regime  and \nallow the sum (Uzbekistan currency) to float against foreign currencies. While this policy action is \nexpected  to  reap  important  medium-  to  long-term  economic  benefits,  it  has  caused  a  sharp \ndepreciation of the local currency by about 90% against the US dollar in the short term. 13  This \nhas led to a deterioration of Uzbekenergo\u2019s debt\u2013equity ratio because of the utility\u2019s exposure to \nforeign currency debts. In response, Uzbekenergo proactively launched a time-bound financial \nrecovery  action  plan  prioritizing  the  following  measures:  (i)  revenue  increase  through \ndevelopment and implementation of tariff methodology, (ii) corporate restructuring and divestment \nof noncore assets, and (iii) improvement of operating efficiency and IFRS-compliant classification \nand impairment provisions on account receivables and payables.14  \n \nThe  project  will  install  an  additional  900  MW  CCGT  capacity  at  the  Talimarjan  TPP  to \n10. \ndirectly address the issues discussed in paras. 4\u20136 and help the government initiative to retire \n3.4 gigawatts of old generation capacity. It will also support the government\u2019s sector reforms and \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial recovery action plan through (i) developing a power sector master plan \nto  rationalize  long-term  investments;  (ii)  preparing  a  tariff  reform  road  map  to  increase \nUzbekenergo\u2019s revenue to the level of full cost recovery including pass-through of costs arising \nfrom external factors such as foreign exchange rate risks, and fuel prices; (iii) introducing IFRS to \na key power generation subsidiary of Uzbekenergo, which will be replicated in other subsidiaries \nand  pave  the  way  for  corporatization  of  generation  companies;  and  (iv)  supporting  the \ndevelopment of a detailed implementation plan for Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial recovery action plan. \nThese reform actions will complement the budget support program requested by the government \nto cushion the impact of foreign exchange reform.  \n \n11. \nThe project is aligned with the government\u2019s strategic emphasis on the energy efficiency \nenhancement and reliable power supply to support its vision for an upper middle-income country \nby  2030  (footnote  2).  It  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for \nUzbekistan  as a  priority project  and  is also well  aligned with the  Country  Partnership Strategy \n(2012\u20132016) for Uzbekistan\u2019s priority to support for energy efficiency to generate power surpluses \nto expand energy export to Afghanistan and other energy-deficient countries in the region. The \nproject also directly supports the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC) \nenergy  strategy,  which  prioritizes  energy  security,  and  reliable  and  more  affordable  energy \nservices in the region through balanced  development  of  region\u2019s  energy  sources and stronger \nintegration  of  energy  markets. 15 The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  supporting \nimproved  energy  security  and  reduced  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  through  the  energy \nefficiency  improvement,  which  will  contribute  Uzbekistan\u2019s  nationally  determined  contributions \nunder the Paris Agreement of reducing carbon intensity by 10% by 2030 from its 2010 level.  \n \nB. \n \n12. \n(footnote 2). The outcome will be efficiency and reliability of power supply improved.16  \n\nThe project impact will be reliable energy supply increased and energy intensity reduced \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n13 As of 1 September 2017, the exchange rate of 1 Uzbekistan Sum was $0.00024, which became $0.000123 on 7 \n\nSeptember 2017 after foreign exchange unification.     \n\n14 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

Output 1 will expand \nTalimarjan TPP capacity by an additional 900 MW through the installation of two 450 MW CCGT \nunits in combined heat and power mode.17 The combined heat and power feature will supplement \nthe heat supply to nearby Nuriston town to meet its growing heat demand for household and rural \nsmall businesses, obviating the need for additional heat-only boilers. The addition will increase \nthe aggregate capacity of Talimarjan TPP to 2,600 MW and improve its average thermal efficiency \nfrom 48% to 52%.18  \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Uzbekenergo financial operation and performance improved. Output 2 will \naddress challenges constraining Uzbekenergo\u2019s capacity to generate adequate cash for capital \ninvestments.  Attached  TA  (para.  20)  will  directly  contribute  to  output  2  by  undertaking  critical \nanalytical work to prepare a sound basis for the next generation of reforms. In particular, the TA \nwill undertake (a) the development of a power sector master plan; (b) tariff reform roadmap (para. \n10);  and  (c)  associated  capacity  building  to  support  and  deepen  sector  reforms,  strengthen \nfinancial management practices, and improve corporate governance of Uzbekenergo. TA outputs \nwill be firmed up after extensive stakeholder consultations. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Institutional capacity enhanced. Output 3 will strengthen the capacity for the \noperation and maintenance of the plant, and provide technical support for the timely and adequate \nmaintenance  of  gas  turbines.  Under  the  project,  an  operational  plan  for  the  community  social \ncenter will be developed and implemented to strengthen ongoing gender mainstreaming activities. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $1,048 million (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost \n$2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  Uzbekenergo  is  the  executing  agency  and  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. ADB will oversee TA activities. The TA will be implemented over 15 months with \nestimated commencement in January 2018 and completion in March 2019.22 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n21. \nThe  project  will  be  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Talimarjan  TPP  within  the  power \ncomplex and will not require any additional land acquisition. The power complex was originally \ndesigned to accommodate 3,200 MW capacity with sufficient supporting infrastructure including \nfuel supply, cooling water systems, and power evacuation. It includes 800 MW gas-fired steam-\ncycle units (commissioned by Uzbekenergo in 2004) and 900 MW CCGT units (financed by ADB \nin  2010).  The  power  from  the  project  will  be  evacuated  through  the  existing  500-kilovolt \ntransmission lines. Natural gas is supplied by Uzbekneftegas, a state-owned gas company, from \nthe  Shuritan  gas  field,  which  is  located  30  kilometers  away  from  the  power  complex. \nUzbekneftegas confirmed that an additional 4.4 million cubic meters per day will be provided via \nthe  existing  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  to  support  the  new  unit.  Cooling  water  requirement  is \n\n                                                \n22  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nsupplied from the Karshi main canal with water sourced primarily from the Amu Darya River with \nback-up supply from Talimarjan reservoir. \n \n22. \nThe project will use commercially available and well-proven gas turbine technology and \nCCGT units with a thermal efficiency of 58% or higher and a capacity of 850\u2013950 MW. The project \nconfiguration includes two gas turbines, two heat-recovery steam generators, one or two steam \nturbines, and supporting facilities. The combined heat and power feature provides an alternative \nsupply to the existing heat boilers as required during the winter heating months. This provides a \nflexible, reliable, and highly efficient way of providing heat to the aging heat supply boilers. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.3%, \n23. \nexceeding  the  benchmark  9%  discount  rate.  The financial  analysis  of  the  project  provides  the \nfinancial internal rate of return of 6.3%, which compares favorably with the weighted average cost \nof capital of 1.7%. Financial viability is gauged by comparing the revenue and cost streams of \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  project.  The  result  of  a  sensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  the \nproject\u2019s  economic  and financial  viability  is  robust  even  under  unfavorable circumstances. The \nfinancial internal rate of return is based on assumptions of increases in end-user tariffs and fuel \nprices, which are estimated based on historical trends in tariff adjustments from 2010 to 2017. In \ncase of insufficient tariff increase, the government has assured that it will provide debt servicing \nand operation coverage to Uzbekenergo. \n \n24. \nThe sharp depreciation of local currency and its impacts on Uzbekenergo\u2019s debt\u2013equity \nratio (para. 9) has resulted in a breach of financial covenants of the ongoing ADB loan for the \nTalimarjan Power Project (footnote 10). Uzbekenergo has developed a robust financial recovery \naction  plan  to  urgently  address  this  and  is  committed  to  complementary  reforms.  The  timely \nimplementation of this action plan is crucial to keep the ongoing reforms on track and pave the \nway for the next generation of reforms. In the interim, it is imperative that Uzbekenergo is allowed \na grace period and suitably adjusted financial covenants to maximize the results of the action plan. \nAccordingly, the project includes more realistic financial covenants as an interim measure and \nseeks  timely  implementation  of  the  action  plan  through  appropriately  formulated  covenants. \nOutput  2  analytical  work  will  complement  the  action  plan  and  help  guide  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 further assistance in key areas to ensure timely implementation as well as \na successful outcome from the action plan.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nSector governance. The power sector is under the direct supervision of the cabinet of \nministers and is managed by Uzbekenergo. The energy policy and the long-term investment plan \nare prepared by the cabinet in coordination with ministries and government agencies. The long-\nterm  investment  plan  (2011\u20132015)  was  updated  annually  and  a  new  plan  for  2015\u20132019  was \nannounced in March 2015. The Ministry of Finance sets the tariff for utility costs. Licenses are \nissued  by  the  State  Inspection  on  Supervision  for  the  Power  Industry  under  the  cabinet. \nInstitutional capacity development activities for Uzbekenergo, such as strengthening safeguard \nassessment,  bringing in modern  and  transparent  performance  assessment,  and upgrading the \nmanagement information system, are under way with ADB support.  \n \n26. \nFinancial management. With insufficient capacity for transparent financial disclosures, \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk is high. Uzbekenergo was able to prepare its first IFRS-\nbased  consolidated  accounts  for  FY2015  only  in  2017  because  of  the  complexity  of  its \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nsubsidiaries\u2019  accounts  and  limited  accounting  skills.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  insufficient  capacity  to \ngenerate its IFRS-based financial statements on a timely basis has resulted in a substantial delay \nin carrying out the entity\u2019s audit. These capacity issues have also resulted in non-compliance with \nsubmission of audited financial statements for the past 2 years under ongoing ADB loans.  The \ngovernment  committed  to  improve  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  management  capacity  including  corporate \ngovernance,  financial  and  management  reporting,  audit,  and  performance  management \nframeworks.  Attached TA  will  help  Uzbekenergo  enhance the  capacity  of  accounting  staff  and \nautomate account consolidation and the management reporting process. Loan covenants have \nbeen included to recruit sufficient qualified financial management accounting staff.    \n \n27. \nProcurement  capacity.  Although  Uzbekenergo  has  procurement  experience  in  similar \nprojects, the inherent procurement risks are high because of the technical complexity and contract \nvalues. An international firm will be hired as project management and supervision consultant to \nassist  in  the  bidding  process  and  contract  management.  The  government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedure is undergoing reform to improve the efficiency and transparency of the procurement \nprocess.  Under  the  reform,  Uzbekenergo  will  establish  an  interagency  tender  committee \ncomprising representatives from government agencies and design institutes.  \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project\u2019s  targeting  classification  is  general  intervention.  The  increased  reliability  of \n29. \npower supply and stable access to grid-connected electricity would indirectly benefit all segments \nof the population, including poor people. Adequate and reliable electricity supply will improve daily \nlife and enable increased economic activity.  \n  \n30. \nThe  project  is  assigned  some  gender  elements.  It  will  strengthen  gender-inclusive \ngovernance and management of the community social center (built as part of the gender action \nplan  under  the  Talimarjan  Power  Project)  through  an  operational  plan  that  aims  to  empower \nwomen. The direct employment of women will be encouraged to maintain the momentum. A social \nand gender specialist in the project management unit will provide support.   \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \nEnvironment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was \n32. \ndisclosed  in  June  2017  in  both  English  and  Russian  languages.  Public  consultation  was \nconducted  in  November  2016,  January  2017,  and  September  2017  for  the  two  nearest \ncommunities (Nuriston and Mekhnatabad) at the scoping stage and twice on the draft EIA report. \nAll  issues  raised  during  the  consultation  were  adequately  addressed  in  the  final  EIA.  The  EIA \nincludes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  due  diligence  assessment  with  a \ncorrective action plan for existing facilities. The EIA report identified potential impacts that would \nbe generated from the project, and proposed an adequate EMP consisting of mitigation measures, \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n23  ADB.

The EMP will form part of the \nbidding documents.  \n \n33. \nSome project impacts are expected during both construction and operation phases in the \nalready  disturbed  environment  of  the  Talimarjan  power  complex.  The  main  concerns  include \n(i) cumulative impact from the new CCGT units on air quality and noise level at the project site \nand  in  the  residential  areas  of  Nuriston  and  Mekhnatabad;  (ii)  the  discharge  of  heated  water, \nwastewater from the sewer and chemical treatment plant, solid waste, and construction waste; \nand (iii) occupational safety. With the adopted emission control technology of CCGT units and \ngas fuel quality, air quality dispersion modelling has confirmed that nitrogen oxides emission will \ncomply  with  the  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines  of  the  International  Finance \nCorporation,  while  sulfur  dioxide  and  particulate  matter  2.5  will  be  negligible.  Noise  generated \nfrom  the  project  will  be within the World  Health Organization  standards. The  project  will  use  a \nhybrid combination of once-through cooling and recirculation cooling using cooling towers. The \nrecirculation  cooling  mode  will  ensure  sufficient  flows  in  the  cooling  canal  and  limit  the \ntemperature  increase  caused  by  the  discharged  water  within  3\u00b0C  (in  compliance  with  the \nEnvironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Guidelines).  Social  and  fish  surveys  confirmed  insignificant \nrisk to human health and economic activities as the water in the canal downstream is used only \nfor  irrigation.  A  health  impact  assessment  was  conducted  to  establish  a  baseline  for  future \nmonitoring and to ensure that the project has no adverse impact on the human health. \n \n34. \nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  EMP  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  national  environmental  regulations.  A \nnational environmental consultant will supplement and strengthen PMU safeguard staff capacity. \nEnvironmental  specialists  of  the  project  implementation  consultant  will  help  the  PMU  in \noverseeing  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  corrective  action  plan.  The  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contract will include costs for implementing mitigation measures; \nthe  consulting  services  of  the  project  implementation  consultant  will  include  costs  for \nenvironmental instrumental monitoring and supervision; and the PMU budget will include costs \nfor  environmental  consultant  support  and  capacity  building.  Independent  monitoring  will  be \narranged with the local environmental authority and will be covered under the PMU budget. The \nproject will use the grievance redress mechanism in place for Talimarjan Power Project to handle \nboth  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  (footnote  10).  Uzbekenergo  will  use  its  own \nresources to implement the corrective action plan. \n  \n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Social  due  diligence  suggests  that  no  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  to  be  expected,  because  construction  work  will  take \nplace within the boundaries of existing Talimarjan power complex.  \n \n36. \ndefined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \nF. \n \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The integrated benefits and impacts of \nthe project are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).

Uzbekenergo will recruit experienced \nprocurement specialists for the project management unit. The \ninstitutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be \ninvolved in procurement to avoid delays in the contract registration.  \nA financial recovery action plan will improve financial sustainability. \nPerformance benchmarks will be monitored as part of the financial \ncovenants in the loan agreement. The government confirmed tariff \nincrease at a rate above the inflation rate to subsidize Uzbekenergo.    \nSufficient and qualified financial management and accounting staff will \nbe recruited and retained.   \nA capacity development program will hire consultants to help \nUzbekenergo establish a robust accounting policy and upgrade of \naccounting and reporting systems. \nTraining for operation and maintenance will be included in the turnkey \ncontract. Scheduled technical services will be included in the project \nscope to ensure adequate maintenance. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n38. \nThe government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  Uzbekenergo \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. \n \n39.    As  a  condition  for  withdrawal  from  the  loan  account  for  any  project  expense  item,  a \nsubsidiary  loan agreement for the relending  of the ADB  loan to Uzbekenergo shall  have been \nsigned and become effective in accordance with the terms. In addition, no withdrawal will be made \nfrom the loan account for purposes of the turnkey contract until Uzbekenergo has furnished to \nADB its audited annual consolidated financial statements for the financial years 2015 and 2016 \nprepared in accordance with IFRS. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$450,000,000 to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan for the  Power  Generation  Efficiency  Improvement \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n21 November 2017\n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nReliable energy supply increased and energy intensity reduced (Decrees of the President of the Republic \nof Uzbekistan)a  \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nEfficiency and \nreliability of power \nsupply improved \n\nOutputs \n1.Talimarjan TPP \ncapacity \nincreased \n\n2.Uzbekenergo \nfinancial \noperation and \nperformance \nimproved  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \na.
