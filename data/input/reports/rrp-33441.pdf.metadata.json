It will\naddress  acid  rain  and  air  pollution  problems  in  the  part  of  the\nYangtze  River  Valley  that  lies  within  Anhui  Province.  In  2000,  the\ntotal  population  of  the  project  area  was  about  17  million.  The\nProject  will  support  policy  reforms  and  institutional  strengthening\nrequired  to  control  acid  rain  and  improve  the  environment.  The\ninvestments  will  (i)  promote  cleaner  production,  energy  efficiency,\nand  waste  minimization  in  six  industrial  enterprises;  (ii)  include\nrain  damage\nthree  environmental \nrehabilitation  subprojects  in  two  ecologically  protected  areas;  and\n(iii)  strengthen  environmental  management  in  institutions  and\nmonitoring agencies in the project area and subproject enterprises.\n\nimprovement  and  acid \n\nCategory B. Sensitive. The summary initial environmental\nexamination was circulated to the Board on 1 August 2001.\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  reduce  acid  rain  in  Anhui,  a  relatively\npoor province with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at\n72 percent of the national average. The air quality in the Yangtze\nRiver  Valley  has  deteriorated  considerably  to  harmful  levels.\nWithout  intervention,  air  quality  will  further  deteriorate  and  acid\nrain frequency will increase, with serious negative implications for\npublic  health  and  economic  development.  The  Anhui  provincial\ngovernment  (APG)  is  implementing  an  acid  rain  control  plan  to\naddress  these  concerns.  APG  has  demonstrated  a  strong  sense\nof  ownership  of  the  Project  by  identifying  subprojects  with\nadequate provision for local currency financing.\n\nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  overall  exposure  to  air  pollution  and\nacid rain of people living and working in the project area, resulting\nin substantial health benefits. Reduced acid rain will also improve\nagricultural and forestry productivity, improve water quality, reduce\nmaterial  damage,  and  enhance  environmental  quality  while\nensuring sustainability of ecologically unique protected areas.\n\nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  provincial  acid  rain  control\nstrategy, and is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy to clean\nup the environment by improving air and water quality in the acid\nrain  control  zone  of  the  PRC.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the\nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  strategy  to  support  measures\nfor environmental improvement and natural resource management\nin  the  PRC.  It  will  be  the  eighth  environmental  improvement\nproject  supported  by  ADB,  and  the  first  to  focus  on  acid  rain\ncontrol.  The  Project  will  also  be \nfirst  environmental\nimprovement project to focus solely on secondary cities.\n\nthe \n\n\fObjective and Scope\n\niii\n\nThe objective of the Project is to control acid rain and improve the\nenvironment  in  the  Yangtze  River  Valley  in  Anhui  Province.  The\nProject  will  promote  cleaner  production,  reduce  waste,  improve\nenergy  efficiency, enhance environmental quality, and strengthen\ninstitutions for environmental management.\n\nThe  Project  has  three  main  components:  (i)  six  subprojects\npromoting  cleaner  production  (CP)  undertaken  by  industrial\nenterprises;  (ii)  three  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain\ndamage  rehabilitation  (EI-ARD)  subprojects  in  two  ecologically\nprotected  areas;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of  provincial\nand  local  environmental  agencies,  and  subproject  enterprises.\nThe six CP subprojects will entail investments to reduce SO2 and\nother gases causing acid rain through CP, and will reduce waste,\nadvance technology, and improve energy efficiency. The three EI-\nARD  subprojects  will  improve  environmental  management  and\nrehabilitate  acid  rain  damage  in  ecologically  rich  protected  areas\nat  Huangshan  and  Jiuhua  mountains.  Institutional  strengthening\nwill focus on improving the policy framework for reducing SO2 and\nother gases causing acid rain, and human resource development\nimproving  environmental\nfor \nmanagement and monitoring.\n\nimplementing  measures  and \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $325  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $147  million  (45  percent)\nand a local currency cost of $178 million equivalent (55 percent).\n\nADB will provide a loan of $147 million to finance the entire foreign\nexchange cost of the Project. The local currency financing of $178\nmillion  equivalent  will  be  arranged  through  domestic  borrowing\n($69.2  million  equivalent),  enterprise  contribution  ($98.2  million\nequivalent),  and  budgetary  allocation \nfrom  provincial  and\nmunicipality governments ($10.6 million equivalent).\n\nA loan of $147 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be\nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will\nhave a 20-year term, including a grace period of 4 years; an interest\nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending\nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  and  a\nfront-end  fee  of  1.0  percent.  The  Borrower  will  make  the  loan\nproceeds available to APG for relending to subproject enterprises\nthrough  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  with  the  same  terms  and\nconditions  as  for  EI-ARD  subproject  enterprises,  and  with  an\namortization period of 14 years including a 4-year grace period for\nCP  subproject  enterprises.  Relending  terms  for  the  institutional\nthe  respective\nstrengthening  component  will  be  similar \nfor  APG\u2019s\n  Lending \nsubproject  enterprises\u2019 \ninstitutional  strengthening  component  will  be  similar  to  the  loan\nrepayment.  The  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks\nwill be borne by the subproject enterprises.\n\nto \nterms \n\nterms. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2006\n\n\fExecuting Agency\n\nImplementation\nArrangement\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\niv\n\nAPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  supervising  overall  subproject\nimplementation  and  coordinating  policy  and  institutional  measures\nto  support  the  Project.

Industrial production and power generation are the two main sources of air pollution. The\neffects  of  air  pollution  on  people  include  various  types  of  respiratory  and  heart  diseases  that\nprimarily affect children, the elderly, and other disadvantaged groups, with the poor suffering the\nmost. Among the negative impacts of acid rain are deterioration of human health, reduction of\nagricultural  and  forestry  production,  poor  water  quality,  destruction  of  biologically  important\necosystems, and damage to cultural and historical structures. The Government has formulated\na  comprehensive  plan  to  overcome  environmental  degradation  and  urban  pollution  associated\nwith  the  acid  rain  problem.  The  plan  targets  the  urban  industry,  energy  production,  and\nresidential  sectors  that  currently  use  coal  as  the  dominant  energy  source  and  are  therefore\nresponsible for much of the air pollution. The deterioration of environmental quality due to acid\nrain is particularly acute in the Yangtze River Valley within Anhui Province which is a poor inland\nprovince  in  the  central  part  of  the  PRC.  Benefits  from  reduced  acid  rain  are  nonexcludable  in\ncharacter and will accrue to all people living in the project area.\n\nIn June 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance1 (TA) to\n3.\nexplore  the  need  for  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  control  acid  rain  and  improve  the\nenvironment in the Yangtze River Valley in Anhui Province (Map 1). Project preparation studies\nwere completed in April 2001 and an ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in April 2001. A\nConsultation  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  May  2001  to  review  enterprise  restructuring  status,\ninstitutional strengthening, and the viability of enterprises for the proposed investments. At the\nrequest  of  the  Government,  an  Appraisal  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  July  2001  to  further\nevaluate  the  Project  and  to  hold  policy  dialogue.2  The  linkages  of  policies,  institutional\nframework,  physical  investments,  and  objectives  of  the  Project  are  described  in  the  project\nframework (Appendix 1). The Project\u2019s thematic classification is environmental protection.\n\nA. \n\nEnvironment Sector\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAcid rain can be a local as well as a transboundary problem occurring as far as 1,000\n4.\nkilometers  (km)  from  the  pollution  source.  It  can  result  in  acidification  of  soil  and  water  and\nreduce  forests\u2019  vulnerability  to  fire.  Soil  acidification  damages  agriculture  and  forestry,  and\nincreased  acidity  adversely  affects  the  ecology  in  water  bodies.  Such  damages  were  first\nreported  in  northern  Europe  and  North  America  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  Forest  damage  in\n\n                  \n\n2000.\n\n1 TA.  3462-PRC: Acid Rain Control and Environmental Improvement Project,  for  $964,000,  approved  on  27  June\n\n2 The  Mission  comprised  P.  Abeygunawardena,  Senior  Economist  for  Environment,  Mission  Leader;  C.S.  Chin,\nSenior Portfolio Management Specialist; X. Ma, Economist (Environment); N.T. Anvaripour, Financial Management\nSpecialist; O. Tiwana, Counsel; A. Hirano, Energy Specialist (Financial) ; and N. Sakata, Intern. The Mission was\nassisted by A. Huq, Senior Project Engineer  from ADB Headquarters.\n\n\f2\n\nnorthern Europe was caused mainly by sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission from the United Kingdom\nand  East  Germany.3  Similarly,  SO2  emissions  from  the  United  States  caused  damage  in\nCanada. Acid rain is also emerging as a major concern in Asia. However, most Asian countries\nhave not taken adequate control measures.\n\n5.\nOver  the  past  two  decades,  the  PRC  has  made  major  progress  in  moving  from  a\nplanned  system  to  a  market-based  economy.  As  with  other  aspects  of  economic  and  social\ndevelopment,  there  have  been  substantial  changes  in  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  agenda.\nRegulatory  and  institutional  capacities  have  been  strengthened,  policies  supporting  energy\nefficiency  and  clean  energy  have  been  adopted,  and  increased  information  dissemination  has\nimproved environmental awareness. From 1990 to 2000, PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrew by about 9.2 percent annually. One of the costs of the country\u2019s rapid economic expansion\nis a worsening of environmental quality, including increased levels of acid rain. According to the\nState Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), acid rain currently falls over 30 percent\nof the nation\u2019s territory or 2.87 million km2 (Map 2). The economy\u2019s continued reliance on coal\nsuggests that efforts to mitigate acid deposition causing emissions should be intensified to cope\nwith the projected increase in the demand for energy.\n\nIt  is  estimated  that  the  PRC  generates  about  90  percent  of  all  SO2  emission  in  East\n6.\nAsia.4  In  2000,  about  20  million  tons  of  SO2  was  discharged  from  PRC  sources  into  the\natmosphere. SO2 from coal burning is the major cause of acid rain.5 The combustion of coal for\nindustrial purposes, energy production, and residential and commercial applications is the major\nreason for emission of gases causing acid rain.6 About 40 percent of total SO2 emissions come\nfrom industrial sources, 41 percent from power generation, and 19 percent from residential and\ncommercial sources. The adverse impacts of acid rain are serious and reducing acid rain needs\nurgent  attention.  Nationwide,  the  annual  economic  losses  caused  by  outdoor  air  pollution  was\nestimated  at  $41  billion  (based  on  1995  data),  of  which  $14  billion  was  attributed  to  acid  rain\n(about  2  percent  of  GDP).  Selection  of  a  strategy  for  acid  rain  control  should  favor  options\noffering  the  biggest  difference  between  marginal  benefits  and  marginal  control  costs.  Large\ninvestments, together with a more stringent regulatory and monitoring framework, are required\nto  address  PRC\u2019s  acid  rain  problem.  In  this  regard,    the  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (10FYP)  has\nemphasized  the  need  for  allocating  1.3  percent  of  GDP  for  environmental  improvement,\nprimarily for pollution control (see para 18).\n\n7.\nEconomic  and  social  indicators  place  Anhui  in  the  bottom  third  of  PRC\u2019s  provinces\ndespite the high economic growth achieved from the 1980s to the late 1990s. This growth was\nachieved by developing a large number of heavy industries, most of which utilize outdated and\ninefficient technology and equipment. Rapid urbanization and increases in motor vehicles have\nalso contributed to the worsening air quality in cities. All these have resulted in high levels of air\nemissions,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste,  causing  high  levels  of  pollution  and  acid  rain.    The\nproblems  are  exacerbated  by  nonuse  of  market-based  instruments  (MBIs)  to  provide  financial\n\n                  \n\n3  Twenty-one  European  nations  met  in  1985  to  discuss  measures  to  prevent  acid  rain  damage,  and  agreements\nreached  are  recorded  in  the  Helsinki  Protocol.  Further,  Canada  and  the  United  States  agreed  in  1991  to  take\nmutual responsibility for establishing common goals for reducing gas emissions that caused acid rain.\n\n4 Considering the continental wind stream, SO2 generated in the PRC affects neighboring countries like Japan and\nthe Republic of Korea. According to the Japanese Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, more than\n20 percent of total sulfur compounds in Japan is  traced to sources in the PRC. More than 40 percent of SO2 in\nFukuoka is estimated to originate in PRC sources.\n\n5  In the PRC, the effective contribution of SO2 and NOx to acid rain is estimated at 85 and 15 percent, respectively.\n6  SO2 emission and consequent acid rain generated by industries have more localized impacts than that associated\nwith power generation. Power generation uses more pollution control devices, lower-sulfur coal, and taller stacks\nthat result in more diffused impacts.\n\n\f3\n\nincentives for environment-friendly behavior, and lack of pollution control equipment and other\nmeasures to reduce or eliminate small sources of air pollution.\n\nThe portion of the Yangtze River Valley7 located in southern Anhui Province is subject to\n8.\nheavy  environmental  pollution  (Map  1).  The  ambient  levels  of  air  pollution  in  the  area,\nparticularly  SO2  and  total  suspended  particulate  (TSP)  levels,  increased  from  the  early  1980s\nthrough the mid-1990s. Energy consumption, which is anticipated to grow at 3 percent per year,\nwill result in significant increases in air pollution loads by the year 2010 if effective measures to\nmeet  the  problem  are  not  implemented.  The  project  area  has  a  population  of  over  17  million,\nwith 80 percent classified as rural residents, and covers about 25 percent of the total land area\nof  the  province.  Although  agriculture  has  experienced  robust  growth  (7  percent  per  annum  in\n1991-1999), the industry sector has been growing more rapidly (19.3 percent per annum). About\n102,000 urban residents and 408,000 rural residents in the project area have per capita annual\nincomes  of  less  than  Y3,000  and  Y1,000,  respectively.  Environmental  degradation  has\nincreased the vulnerability of poor and low-income households in the project area.\n\n1.\n\nAcid Rain Control\n\n9.\nWithin  Anhui,  the  Huai  River  and  Chao  Lake  have  received  national  attention  due  to\nenvironmental concerns. The Huai River, Chao Lake, and a portion of the acid rain control zone\nalong  the  Yangtze  River  Valley  (in  Anhui)  are  part  of  the  national  environmental  protection\nprogram  established  in  1998.  Due  to  its  subtropical  climate  and  geographic  diversity,  Anhui\nprovince is ecologically rich. The province also has a long-standing and strong cultural heritage.\nMotivated by those factors and serious environmental damage to the fragile ecosystems due to\nheavy industrial pollution, the province has pioneered in taking various initiatives to clean up the\nenvironment.8  The  province  also  developed  a  well-thought-out  acid  rain  control  plan.  In  1997,\nthe  State  Council  designated  five  prefectures  (Chaohu,  Tongling,  Wuhu,  Maanshan,  and\nXuanzhou)  as  the  acid  rain  control  zone  of  Anhui  Province.  The  zone  was  extended  to  cover\necologically sensitive Huangshan in 1998 (Map 2). The State Council requires these prefectures\nto remedy damage caused by acid rain.\n\n10.\nDuring  9FYP  period  (1996-2000),  Anhui\u2019s  environment  objectives  were  to  (i) bring\nenvironmental pollution under control, (ii) improve the quality of the environment in major cities,\n(iii) reduce degradation of natural-ecological systems, and (iv) integrate environmental planning\nwith  economic  and  social  development  efforts.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Government\nstrengthened  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  effective  environmental\nmanagement.  The 10FYP (2001-2005) further promotes the objectives of sustainable economic\nand  social  development,  while  targeting  environmental  quality  improvements.    In  the\nenvironment  sector  the  emphasis  is  on    (i)  reducing  the  total  pollution  loads  to  achieve  the\ndesignated  ambient  air  and  water  quality  standards,  (ii) continuing  environmental  quality\nimprovements in the cities, (iii) reversing the degradation of ecologically sensitive areas, and (iv)\ncontrolling and reducing environmental and ecological damage caused by acid rain.\n\n11.\nThe average annual environment investment in Anhui was about $1.6 billion during the\n9FYP period, about 0.95 percent of the provincial GDP. In the 10FYP, a 20 percent reduction of\n\n                  \n\n7 It  provides  water  for  about  11  million  residents;  492  major  industrial  enterprises,  each  with  annual  output  values\nexceeding Y5 million; 1.8 million hectares of agricultural land; and an extensive fishing and aquaculture industry.\n8 ADB  assistance  for  the  cleanup  of  Chao  Lake  under  Loans  1490  and  1491-PRC:Anhui  Environmental\nImprovement Project, for $112 million and $28 million, respectively, approved on 26 November 2996 has greatly\nsupported  these  efforts  by  reducing  over  half  of  wastewater  discharged  to  Chao  Lake  through  wastewater\ntreatment activities.\n\n\f4\n\nSO2  from  the  2000  level  is  mandated  for  the  acid  rain  control  zone.  Studies  financed  by  ADB\nshow that acid rain damage in the area along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are more\nserious than in other parts of the PRC.9 A centerpiece of the Anhui Province 10FYP is the SO2\nand  Acid  Rain  Control  Program,  with  emphasis  on  restricting  the  mining  of  high-sulfur  coal,\nintroducing  clean  coal  technologies,  and  expanding  urban  gas  supply  and  district  heating\nsystems (Appendix 2).\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Legislation and Regulations\n\n12.\nIn the PRC, most environmental protection policies are implemented at the subnational\nlevel within the framework of national legislation, regulations, and standards.  The provincial and\nmunicipal  governments,  through  their  respective  environment  protection  bureaus  (EPBs),  are\nresponsible  for  implementing  national  policies  and  are  authorized  to  act  in  the  absence  of\nnational  standards.  Where  warranted  by  local  conditions,  provincial  EPBs  may  impose  more\nstringent  standards  than  those  required  by  the  national  Government.  In  general,  Anhui  has\nadopted national standards for air, water, and solid waste management.\n\n13. With assistance from ADB and other aid agencies, the Government has issued a series\nof  laws  on  the  use  of  natural  resources  and  has  instituted  a  system  of  monitoring,  recording,\nand reporting the discharge of pollutants.10 During the 1990s, the major laws on prevention and\ncontrol  of  air,  water,  and  solid  waste  pollution  were  all  updated.    The  Air  Pollution  Prevention\nand Control Law was amended in 1995 and again in early 2000. The current law allows more\nflexibility  in  meeting  air  quality  objectives,  and  has  more  definitive  provisions  for  enforcement.\nSupported  by  the  2000  amendment  to  the  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Law,  the\nGovernment,  in  its  10FYP  will  enforce  a  cap  on  SO2  emission  levels.  The  cap  is  a  necessary\nfirst step in applying MBIs for environmental management such as emission permit trading. With\nrespect to SO2 and acid rain control, the law emphasizes a number of measures for improving\ncoal  quality:  (i) new  high-sulfur  coal  mines  (1.5 percent  or  higher  sulfur)  must  install  coal\nwashing  facilities;  (ii) existing  high-sulfur  coal  mines  must  install  washing  equipment  within\ndesignated time limits; (iii) coal with sulfur content over 3 percent will neither be produced nor\nused; and (iv) in designated areas in important cities, highly polluting fuels, including high-sulfur\ncoal, are to be phased out.\n\n14.\nThe Anhui Environment Protection Bureau (AEPB) was established in 1993 as an official\nagency  to  manage  environmental  matters  in  the  province.  Several  important  environment-\nrelated  legislation  and  regulations  have  been  passed.11  During  the  1990s,  provincial  priorities\nwere in the water sector, with ADB loan and TA subprojects focusing on pollution problems in\nthe Huai River and Chao Lake basin.12  Beginning in the late 1990s, more attention was directed\nto  air  pollution  and  acid  rain  challenges.  Anhui  has  implemented  most  national  policies,\n\n                  \n\n9 TA  5528-REG: Acid Rain and Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in Asia,  for  $450,000,  approved  on  16 April\n1993;  and  TA  5585-REG:  Acid Rain and Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in Asia Phase II,  for  $600,000,\napproved on 7 May 1997.\n\n10 TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.\n11 The  environmental  regulations  include  (i) Potable  Water  Source  Protection  of  Dongpu  Reservoir,  Hefei  City,\nDecember  1987;  (ii) Chao  Lake  Water  Resources  Protection,  January  1988;  (iii)  Technical  Management  of\nEnvironmental  Protection  Organizations  in  Anhui  Province,  November  1989;  (iv)  Fishery  Act  By-laws  for  Anhui\nProvince, August 1989; (v) Water Pollution Discharge Permits in Hefei City, October 1990; (vi) Sewage Discharge\nPermits in Hefei City, November 1990; (vii) Natural Forestry and Wildlife Protection Focus in Anhui Province, May\n1990;  (viii)  State  Forestry  Implementation  Procedures  in  Anhui  Province,  October  1990;  and  (ix)  Integrated\nStandards for Wastewater Discharge in Anhui Province, April 1993.\n\n12 TA 2693-PRC: Formulation of an Integrated Management Plan for Chao Lake Basin, for $800,000, approved on 26\n\nNovember 1996.

Cities in\nthe  project  area  are  required  to  relocate  heavy  industries  into  zones  designated  by  law.\nEmission  permits  are  now  used  to  regulate  air  emissions  under  the  total  emission  control\npolicy.14\n\n3. \n\nStandards and Incentives\n\nNational  standards  have  been  developed  for  emissions  and  ambient  concentrations  of\n15.\npollutants. Ambient standards have been established for (i) air quality (three grades designated\nfor natural resource protection, urban, and industrial areas); (ii) environmental quality of surface\nwater; (iii) environmental noise in urban areas; (iv) fisheries water quality; and (v) marine water\nquality.  PRC standards are generally similar to international norms.  Emissions standards have\nalso been established for industrial waste gases (e.g., SO2, NOX, TSP, and carbon monoxide),\nwastewater, and solid waste.  These standards are updated periodically in response to health,\ntechnological,  and  legal  developments.  ADB  has  provided  assistance  for  formulating,  refining,\nand improving environmental standards and enforcement policies.15\n\n16.\nAnhui  is  following  the  central  Government\u2019s  environmental  management  framework,\nadopting  both  command-and-control  and  incentive  methods  to  reach  its  environmental  goals.\nCommand-and-control approaches include mandatory environmental impact assessment (ElA),\nland  use  management,  emission  controls  and  enforcement  at  enterprises  that  do  not  meet\nnational  standards,  emission  permits,  closure  of  small-scale  highly  polluting  industries,\ncentralized treatment of wastes, and total emissions control. Emission monitoring is conducted\nmainly by enterprises, with periodic compliance monitoring performed by EPBs. Environmental\nmonitoring stations operated by EPBs conduct ambient air quality monitoring.\n\n17.\nEconomic  incentive  approaches  include  the  pollution  levy  system,  tradable  permits,\ntaxes  on  polluting  inputs,  and  tax  rebates  administered  at  the  municipal  level.  Levies  have\ntraditionally been collected only for the pollutant that most exceeds the corresponding emission\nstandard; the levies need to be modified to reflect environmental costs through charges on the\ntotal  amount  of  emissions.  The  levies  also  need  to  be  increased  to  make  them  more  of  an\nincentive for industries to make the necessary investments to reduce pollution. The existing SO2\ntax,  based  on  total  amount  of  emissions,  is  collected  in  designated  SO2  and  acid  rain  control\nzones. Funds from pollution levies will continue to be rebated to enterprises for improving their\npollution control facilities.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Plans and Policies\n\n1.\n\nNational Acid Rain Control Strategy\n\n18.\nThe  Government  is  making  significant  efforts  to  clean  up  the  urban  environment  and\ncontrol  industrial  pollution.  Investment  in  environmental  improvement  projects  increased  from\n\n                  \n\n13 Key provincial regulations and related documents include Circular on Levy of SO2 Pollution Charges in Acid Rain\nControl Zones (1998), Circular on Distribution of State Council Reply and Zoning Option of Acid Rain Control and\nSO2 Pollution Control (1998), Circular on Distribution of SEPA: Circular on Implementation of SO2 Levy Standards\n(2000), the draft Integrated Program of Treatment and Control of SO2 Pollution in Acid Rain Control Zones of Anhui\nProvince 1999), and the draft Tenth Five-Year Environmental Protection Plan (2000).\n\n14 TA 3121-PRC: Improving Environmental Management in Suzhou Creek, for $840,000, approved on 29 June 1999;\n\nTA  3325-PRC: Shanxi Air Quality Improvement Project, for $700,000, approved on  29 November 1999.\n\n15 TA 2505-PRC: Strengthening Environmental Standards and Environmental Policies, for $600,000, approved on 22\n\nDecember 1995.\n\n\f6\n\n0.67  percent  of  the  gross  national  product  (GNP)  during  the  7FYP  (1986\u20131990)  period  to\napproximately  0.93  percent  of  GDP  during  the  9FYP  period.  This  level  of  commitment  is\nexpected  to  increase  to  approximately  1.3  percent  of  GDP  or  about  $85  billion  during  10FYP.\nThe Government has increased attention to controlling acid rain damage through reduced SO2\nemission. The 1995 Amendment of Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law provides the legal\nbasis  for  acid  rain  prevention  and  control  in  the  PRC.  The  law  introduced  the  concept  of  SO2\nand acid rain control zones (Map 2). In 1998 the State Council approved the demarcation of the\ntwo  control  zones  as  proposed  by  SEPA.  The  two  zones  generate  60  percent  of  PRC\u2019s  SO2\nemissions.  They  are  important  to  the  national  economy  considering  their  concentrated\npopulation and industrial output. The Guidance on the Development of the Tenth Five-Year Plan\nof PRC, which was approved by the People\u2019s Congress in March 2001, sets up the goal of SO2\nemission reduction. By the end of 2005, SO2 emissions in the acid rain control zone should be\nreduced by 20 percent from the emission level in 2000 (see para 20).\n\n19.\nTo  implement  the  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Law,  the  revised  emission\nstandards require that power plants located in the two control zones must meet both emission\nconcentration  limits  and  mandated  total  emission  levels.  In  addition,  SO2  emission  standards\nare issued for boilers, coking ovens, and cement plants. Taxing SO2 emissions is an important\ninstrument adopted by the Government for acid rain control. In 1998, SEPA, issued the Notice\non Extending Areas for Trial Implementation of SO2 Emission Levy in the two control zones.\n\n20.\nTo reach the goal of the 10FYP for SO2 reduction and acid rain control, the Government\nwill emphasize the following strategies during the 10FYP period: (i) control SO2 emission from\ncoal  burning  by  limiting  the  production  and  use  of  high-sulfur  coal,  promoting  steam  coal\nwashing, accelerating desulfurization in power plants, and controlling SO2 emissions from other\ncoal-firing sources such as industrial boilers and kilns; (ii) promote clean energy utilization and\nimprove the energy mix by increasing the use of gas and electricity and reducing the use of high\npollution  fuels  in  cities,  promoting  renewable  energy,  and  adjusting  the  spatial  layout  of  SO2\nemission  sources;  and  (iii) strengthening  management  and  monitoring  by  practicing  regional\ntotal  SO2  emission  control,  implementing  emission  permits/license  systems  on  key  SO2\nemission  sources,  implementing  SO2  emission  permit  trading  system,  strengthening  the  SO2\nlevy system by raising charges, and establishing a national acid rain monitoring network.\n\n2.\n\nProvincial Acid Rain Control Plan\n\n21. Within  the  national  policy  framework,  the  Anhui  provincial  10FYP  has  set  goals  for  air\nquality improvement: (i) reduce SO2 emission by 20 percent in six cities located in the acid rain\ncontrol zone; (ii) meet SO2 and NO2 ambient air quality standards (Class II) in all cities; (iii) meet\nTSP ambient air quality standard (Class II) in Hefei and Huaibei, and (iv) meet TSP ambient air\nquality  standard  (Class  III)  in  all  other  cities.16  Acid  rain  control  in  the  Yangtze  River  Valley  is\none  of  eight  priority  issues  in  environmental  management  to  be  addressed  during  the  10FYP\nperiod.  The  strategies  to  achieve  these  targets  will  include  (i)  stricter  enforcement  of\n\n16 National standards are as follows (annual daily average concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter):\n\n                  \n\nTSP\nSO2\nNitrogen oxide\nCarbon dioxide\n\nClass I\n80\n20\n50\n4,000\n\nClass II\n200\n60\n50\n4,000\n\nClass III\n300\n100\n100\n6,000\n\n\f7\n\nenvironmental  and  pollution  standards;  (ii)  energy  supply  management  (mainly  cleaner  coal\ntechnology and boiler modernization); and (iii) industrial source control (via cleaner technology\nupgrades in large enterprises and, where necessary, stack emissions controls).\n\nSpecifically,  the  provincial  10FYP  envisages  that  SO2  emissions  will  be  reduced  in  the\n22.\nproject area from the current level of about 143,000 tons per year (t/yr) to 114,400 t/yr, which is\nequivalent to 20 percent reduction over the 10FYP period. The measures envisaged to achieve\nthis  goal  include  (i) controlling  acid  rain  and  air  pollution  through  CP,  industrial  structure\nadjustment,  and  relocating  industries;  (ii)  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  promoting  clean\nenergy in power generation; (iii) increasing electricity and gas use in urban centers; (iv) closing\nsmall,  heavily  polluting  enterprises;  (v)  strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity,  especially\nenvironmental  monitoring  and  enforcement;  (vi)  promoting  MBIs;  and  (vii)  promoting  public\neducation and participation. If the 10FYP projects are all implemented, acid rain frequency and\nseverity should be substantially reduced by 2005. Under the provincial SO2 and acid rain control\nstrategy, Anhui provincial government (APG) plans to improve pollution control for over 25 of the\nlargest  polluting  industries  in  the  project  area.  Full  implementation  of  the  SO2  and  acid  rain\ncontrol strategy will require over $650 million during 2001-2005.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\nSeveral key agencies at the national level, are active in environmental policy making and\n23.\nimplementation.  The  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  Protection  Commission  of  the\nNational  People\u2019s  Congress  is  the  major  decision-making  and  policy  formulation  body.  SEPA,\nelevated  to  ministerial  status  in  1998,  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  national\nenvironmental  policy.  The  State  Council  issues  periodic  decisions  for  enforcement  of  specific\nnational  environmental  objectives.  The  environmental  offices \nin  other  ministries,  and\ncoordination  among  the  agencies,  need  to  be  improved  to  achieve  an  integrated  national\nenvironment policy.\n\n24. \nNationwide,  a  five-level  administration  system  for  environmental  protection  and\nenvironmental  management  covers  all  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and  municipalities.\nEPBs have been established at the provincial, municipal, county, and township levels. EPBs are\nImplementing\nassisted  by  environmental \nenvironmental  policies  and  regulations  and  formulating  measures  to  improve  the  local\nenvironment are the responsibility of the provinces and municipalities. SEPA regularly collects\ninformation  from  EPBs  to  establish  a  nationwide  profile  of  environmental  data  and  to  identify\nenvironmental  trends  that  could  call  for  increased  mitigation  efforts.  SEPA  also  publishes\nnational statistics on key environmental indicators and trends.\n\ninstitutes  and  monitoring  centers. \n\nresearch \n\n25.\nAnhui  has  developed  an  environmental  management  organization  at  three  levels,  with\nan  administrative  organization  similar  to  the  central  Government.  The  local  governments  are\nresponsible for environmental quality within their jurisdictions. The Provincial People's Congress\nis responsible for promulgating provincial environmental laws and regulations, according to the\nnational requirements or making them more stringent; taking note of environmental issues and\nconcerns  raised  by  the  public;  and  keeping  the  provincial  government  informed  of  public\nconcerns.  The  Anhui  provincial  EPB  is  headed  by  a  vice-governor  in  charge  of  environment\nprotection; other members are the director of AEPB; and the director or deputy director of the\nAnhui  Provincial  Planning  Commission  (APPC),  Provincial  Trade  and  Economic  Commission,\nProvincial  Construction  Commission,  Anhui  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (APFB),  and  related\n\n\f8\n\ngovernment  agencies.  Each  city  or  county  has  an  EPB.17  The  total  number  of  staff  working  in\nAEPB  and  the  municipal  and  county  EPBs  was  4,104  by  the  end  of  2000,  of  which  266  staff\nwork  for  AEPB;  the  remaining  3,838  work  for  the  city,  county,  and  township  environmental\nagencies.  Of  the  total  4,104  staff,  464  people  are  engaged  in  environmental  management,\n1,351 are involved in monitoring, 106 work in research institutes, 39 are in information centers,\n978 are in pollution levy fees collection and the rest are engaged in various other functions.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nThe  World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  the  United  Nations\n26.\nDevelopment  Programme,  and  ADB  have  provided  major  external  assistance \nthe\nenvironment  sector  of  the  PRC.    Most  of  the  $5.2  billion  (1992-2000)  World  Bank  assistance\nhas focused on urban environmental improvement in areas such as water supply and sanitation,\nclean  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  and  air  pollution  control.  The  World  Bank  Group  also\nfinanced a multiyear program that included sector studies, institutional strengthening, and loan\nsupport  for  environmental  protection  investments,  primarily  at  the  provincial  and  municipal\nlevels.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  policy  dialogue  emphasizes  environmental  strategies  such  as  MBIs,\nand  promotion  of  diverse  environmental  investments  (air  pollution  control,  water,  and  natural\nresource  and  management).  By  end-2000,  ADB  had  provided  over  $2.4  billion  to  support\nimproved  management  of  environment  and  natural  resources  (about  $2.1  billion  for  control  of\nindustrial and urban pollution and $0.3 billion for natural resources management). Total lending\nfor environment-related projects represents approximately 25 percent of total ADB lending to the\nPRC.18\n\nto \n\nAn  ongoing  World  Bank-supported  Enterprise  Reform  Project  aims  to  learn  from\n27.\ninnovative  methods  for  the  reform  of  PRC\u2019s  state-owned  enterprise  sector  and  help  deepen\nenterprise  reform.  The  enterprise  reform  measures  under  this  project  address  (i)  corporate\nrestructuring  and  transformation  of  large  and  medium-size  enterprises,  (ii)  management\ndevelopment,  (iii)  retraining  and  reemployment  of  laid-off  state  enterprise  employees,  and  (iv)\ndevelopment of private small and medium-size enterprises. The project is being implemented in\nthe  municipalities  of  Changsha,  Shenyang,  Wuhan,  and  Wuhu.  The  assessment  of  the  pilot\nexperience will be disseminated beyond the pilot municipalities. It is anticipated that the proven\nsuccessful measures for enterprise reforms will be replicated by other enterprises.\n\n28.\nThe  UNDP  has  financed  studies  on  marine  pollution  monitoring,  and  coal  preparation,\nand  \u2013through  the  Global  Environment  Facility\u2013studies  relating  to  the  development  of  coal  bed\nmethane resources and their impact on climate change, and for outlining issues and options in\ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  control.

The  loan  projects  addressing  environmental  problems  in\nseveral  major  cities  have  been  generally  successful.20  The  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and\nenvironmental  issues  has  proven  to  be  successful.    It  was  found  that  in  these  operations,\nsavings in energy and other financial costs associated with environmental pollution can be large\nenough to repay the loans. The December 2000 Country Portfolio Review Mission endorsed the\nfindings.  However, it identified the following issues in project implementation: (i) delay in project\ncommencement;  (ii)  change  in  project  scope  and  delay  in  project  completion;  (iii)  delay  in\nprocurement,  contract  awards,  particularly  in  civil  works;  and  (iv) nonadherence  to  policy\nrevision and financial covenants.\n\n30.\nThe  implementation  of  about  25  environmental  improvement  and  energy  efficiency\nsubprojects supported by ADB loans21 was examined during project processing. ADB-financed\nphysical  facilities  are  generally  completed  in  accordance  with  design  specifications.  Project\ncompletion  was  mostly  on  schedule;  some  subprojects  were  completed  ahead  of  schedule.\nThese  achievements  are  attributed  to  strong  project  implementation  capability.  The  strong\nsense  of  ownership  and  experienced  technical  team  further  contributed  to  successful\ncompletion of projects. Environmental improvement and energy conservation objectives set out\nduring appraisal were substantially met.\n\n31.\nThe  review,  however,  identified  several  emerging  concerns.  Timely  availability  of\ndomestic  resources  is  a  constraint  in  some  projects  involving  enterprises.  This  is  partly  an\noutcome  of  the  financial  sector  reforms  introduced  since  the  mid-1990s  under  which\ngovernment  agencies  can  no  longer  direct  banks  to  support  priority  projects.

The disposal and treatment of hazardous wastes and the relocation\nand renovation of chemical plant components were cancelled.\n(iv)  Loan  1490-PRC:  Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater Treatment,  for  $28\nmillion, approved on 26 November 1996.\n(v) Loan 1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Industrial Pollution Abatement, for  $112 million,\napproved on 26 November 1996\n(vi) Loan 1543-PRC: Xi'an-Xianyang-Tongchuan Environment Improvement Project, for $156 million, approved on\n24  September  1997,  are  proceeding  well  except  for  the  two  cogeneration  components  in  Xianyang  and\nTongchuan.\n\n21  Qingdao  Environment  Improvement  (Loan  1207-PRC);  Fertilizer  Industry  Restructuring  (Loan  1248-PRC);\nTangshan and Chengde Environment Improvement (Loan 1270-PRC); Beijing Environmental Improvement (Loan\n1336-PRC);  Second Industrial Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement  (Loan  1436-PRC);  and  Xian-\nXianyang-Tongchuan Environment Improvement (Loan 1543-PRC).\n\n\f10\n\nof disclosure, is generally weak and needs strengthening. The two ongoing Anhui environmental\nimprovement  projects  are  being  implemented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  All  subprojects  were\ncompleted  within  the  appraisal  cost  estimates  and  implementation  schedule,  except  that  the\nHefei Iron and Steel subproject was delayed by one year because of a shortfall in counterpart\nfunding.  The  completed  facilities  are  performing  as  envisaged,  and  energy  efficiency  and\nenvironmental improvement have largely been realized.\n\n32.\nLower  market  prices  that  prevailed  for  most  of  the  public  utility  type  projects  (such  as\ndistrict  heating,  gas,  and  wastewater  treatment)  encourraged  shift  to  environment  friendly\nenergy  use  that  produced  substantial  environmental  benefits.  For  some  utility  enterprises,\nGovernment  subsidies  including loan repayments are crucial for survival. External intervention\nin  price  determination,  and  availability  of  cheaper  substitutes  in  the  increasingly  competitive\nmarkets  have  adversely  impinged  on  the  financial  viability  of  some  subprojects.  Industrial\nsubprojects  have  performed  relatively  better  though  their  financial  performance  has  been\ngenerally lower than projected. Financial performance in some industrial enterprises has been\nunfavorable due to their inability to respond to changing market conditions. This inability will be\neven  more  critical  since  PRC\u2019s  membership  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  will  increase\ncompetition by connecting domestic and global markets.\n\n33.\nLack  of  exposure  to  modern  management  techniques  and  limited  research  and\ndevelopment could adversely affect the future prospects of these enterprises. While ADB loan\nfunds  for  human  resource  development  were  provided  in  all  past  projects,  these  funds  were\nintended  for  international  training  on  technical  matters  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)\nactivities.  Most  enterprises  opted  to  use  only  part  of  the  allocated  loan  funds  to  finance\ninternational  training  of  their  O&M  staff.  The  enterprises  did  not  fully  recognize  the  need  to\nadopt  modern  management  techniques  and  were  reluctant  to  spend  scarce  foreign  exchange\nfor  management  training.  These  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  during  project  design\nthrough  various  human  resource  development  activities  in  the  institutional  strengthening\ncomponent.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  is  designed  to  assist  in  (i)  improving  the\n34.\nefficiency  of  the  economy,  (ii)  promoting  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  poorer  interior\nprovinces,  and  (iii) improve  environmental  and  natural  resource  management. \nthe\nenvironment  sector,  the  strategy  focuses  on  (i) strengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory\nfor  sustainable  environmental  management;  (ii)  supporting  capacity-building\nframework \nprograms  for  EIA  monitoring  and  enforcement;  (iii) supporting  the  use  of  economic  measures\n(taxes,  charges,  and  fees),  supply-side  measures  (integrated  resource  planning  and  fuel\nswitching), and other measures (waste minimization and recycling) to ensure sustainable use of\nnatural  resources;  and  (iv) promoting  the  use  of  cleaner  process  technologies  for  industrial\nproduction and clean energy technologies for power generation. The Project, with its emphasis\non  improving  environmental  quality,  is  fully  in  accord  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  operational\nstrategy to support environmentally sustainable economic growth.\n\nIn \n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1. \n\nAcid Rain Control\n\n35.\nThe Government has recognized acid rain as a major threat to the economic and social\nwell-being  of  a  vast  proportion  of  the  country.  In  1998,  the  Government  through  SEPA\n\n\f11\n\ndesignated  two  control  zones,  one  for  acid  rain  control  and  the  other  for  SO2  control.  ADB\nprovided  TAs  to  study  the  regional  dimensions  of  the  acid  rain  problem  (footnote  9).  The\nGovernment  is  aware  that  the  two  control  zone  programs  have  several  weaknesses.  The\nunderstanding  of  source-receptor  relationships  (impact  reduction  vs.  emission  reduction)  and\ncost-effectiveness in selecting abatement measures need to be improved. The threshold sulfur\ncontent  value  for  the  coal  consumed  by  power  plants  needs  to  be  tightened.  Among  other\nweaknesses are (i) inconsistent or counterproductive economic and environmental policies; (ii)\ninadequate  institutional  capacity,  especially  for  monitoring  and  enforcement;  (iii)  lack  of\ntechnical know-how and inadequate management and technical capability, particularly for small\nand  medium-size  enterprises;  and  (iv) inadequate  economic  incentive  for  polluting  sources  to\nadopt cleaner production processes. These need attention to achieve the 10FYP\u2019s objective of\n20 percent SO2 reduction in the two control zones.\n\n36.\nThe  major  programs  developed  for  acid  rain  control  include  provincial  and  sector  SO2\nreduction  plans;  promotion  of  clean  energy  and  CP;  closure  of  small  high-sulfur  coal  mines,\nsmall  power  generation  units,  small  cement  and  small  glass  plants;  and  controlling  major\npolluting  sources.  Often,  SO2  reduction  is  linked  with  greenhouse  gas  (GHG),  such  as  CO2\n,levels. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a flexible tool that is prescribed under the\nKyoto  protocol  to  reduce  GHG  emissions.  CDM  will  allow  emission  reduction  credit  to  be\ngenerated  through  projects  such  as  for  cleaner  energy  and  energy  efficiency  in  developing\ncountries. The PRC has a large potential to use CDM. ADB is pursuing this potential through its\npolicy dialogue under a TA.22\n\n37.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  a  comprehensive  approach  instead  of  ad  hoc\nmeasures  should  be  adopted  for  acid  rain  control.  In  line  with  these  developments,  APG  is\nimplementing a comprehensive acid rain control plan in a phased manner, initially in the project\narea  and  existing  acid  rain  and  SO2  control  zones,  and  later  the  entire  province.  APG  will\nstrengthen environmental management decision-making systems, monitoring and enforcement\nbacked by incentive measures to reduce acid rain and environmental pollution. Activities related\nto  policy  dialogue  include  (i)  implementation  of  the  provincial  SO2  and  acid  rain  control  plan;\n(ii) promotion  of  CP;  (iii) introduction  of  MBIs \nimproved\nenvironmental management; (iv) promotion of cleaner energy source and energy efficiency; (v)\nsupport  for  environmental  investments  in  small-  and  medium-scale  industries;  (vi)  closure  of\ninefficient  and  polluting  small-scale,  loss-incurring  industrial  enterprises;  and  (vi)  recylcing  of\nproject funds for acid rain control (para 61).\n\nfor  air  pollution  control  and \n\n2.\n\nEnterprise Restructuring\n\n38.\nOver  the  past  decade,  autonomy  in  economic  management  has  gradually  increased\nthrough  the  introduction  of  market  forces,  competition,  and  opening  of  the  economy  to\ninternational  trade  and  investment.    With  legislation  such  as  the  Company  Law  in  1994,  the\n1999  Accounting  Act,  and  the  1999  Securities  Law,  more  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)\nbegan  to  corporatize  by  creating  either  limited-liability  companies  (LLCs)  or  limited-liability\nshareholding companies (LLSCs), with the State remaining as the major owner. This new legal\nframework  allowed  the  companies  registered  as  LLSCs  to  offer  their  shares  to  the  public\nthrough  the  Shanghai  Stock  Exchange  or  the  Shenzhen  Stock  Exchange.  The  introduction  of\ncorporatization and the shareholding system is helping to improve corporate governance in the\nday-to-day management of enterprises by separating the owner and management functions of\nthe  State.  The  enterprises  were  to  divest  the  previously  noncore  businesses  and  their  social\n\n22 TA  5297-REG:  Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Greenhouse Gas Abatement,  for\n\n                  \n\n$5,000,000, approved on 4 January 2001.\n\n\f12\n\nfunctions  (e.g.,  medical  care,  housing,  canteens,  child-care  centers,  and  schools)  to  create\nleaner  enterprises.  If  properly  restructured  to  operate  in  a  modern  corporate  form,  the\nenterprises  will  benefit  from  the  newly  introduced  reforms  such  as  competition  in  product\nmarkets, capital markets, and labor and managerial markets.\n\n39.\nInitially pilot tested, enterprise reform has now become a mainstream economic activity\n(Appendix  3).  In  Anhui  Province,  the  Provincial  Economic  and  Trade  Commission  considered\n145 of 210 larger enterprises to have completed the formal phase of reform as of March 2001.23\nThirty-eight  additional  large  enterprises  are  expected  to  complete  the  process  by  the  end  of\n2001. The reformed companies have adopted either a simple LLC, or LLSC with domestic listing\nof shares in some cases. Enterprise reform was an important feature of Loans 1490/1491 that\nprovided for investment activities accompanied by reform of four industrial enterprises and two\nmunicipal wastewater treatment utilities.24  With one exception (Hefei Iron and Steel Company),\nthese reform measures have been fully met to date and the reforms are proceeding well.25\n\n40.\nThe  Government  and  APG  recognize  that  enterprise  governance  is  essential  for  the\nviability  and  sustainability  of  environmental  improvement.  Hence,  the  enterprises  will  pursue\nrestructuring  to  achieve  higher  levels  of  corporate  governance.  A  substantial  portion  of  the\nproposed  ADB  assistance  will  be  used  for  restructuring.  The  policy  dialogue  led  to  the\nestablishment  of  Wuhu  Hengchang  Copper  Refinery  Company  (WHC)  as  a  new  LLC  in  June\n2001.  All  enterprises  have  reached  different  stages  of  enterprise  reform.    It  was  agreed  that\neach CP enterprise will prepare a time-bound action plan for future restructuring and conversion\nto  a  LLSC.  The  enterprise  restructuring  strategies  for  all  enterprises  will  cover  four  key  areas:\n(i) business  strategy  plans,  (ii) corporate  governance,  (iii)  accounting  and  financial  reporting,\nand  (iv) information  technology  upgrade.  As  part  of  the  policy  dialogue,  the  following  was\nagreed  upon:  (i) diversification  of  the  board  of  directors  for  each  enterprise;  (ii)  adoption  of\ninternational  accounting  standards  as  of  31  December  2003;  (iii)  constitution  of  audit,\nperformance evaluation, and risk management committees; (iv) appointment of internal auditors,\nfinancial controllers, and external auditors; and (v) use of competitive bidding for procurement.\nFurther, most enterprises will take steps to separate their noncore businesses such as schools,\nhospitals, and hotels from their main activities. Separating noncore activities will be completed\nbefore loan disbursements.\n\n41.\nTraditional management practices and unwillingness to face social problems associated\nwith enterprise reforms, particularly in laying off redundant workers, are some of the reasons for\nslow  progress  in  enterprise  restructuring.  During  policy  dialogue,  APG  agreed  to  continue  to\nrestructure  subproject  enterprises,  promote  corporate  governance,  and  strengthen  their\nmanagement capabilities to face market competition in the future. The remaining challenges for\nenterprise  restructuring  include  (i) diversifying  the  shareholding  system  to  reduce  the  State\u2019s\nshare and bring new investors with capital, management know-how, technology, and access to\nwider  markets;  (ii)  strengthening  the  corporate  governance  structure  by  empowering  board\nmembers;  (iii) improving  management  practices  through  a  proper  performance  evaluation,\n\n                  \n\n23 The World Bank is currently implementing an enterprise reform and restructuring project in the area. The objective\nis to learn from innovative methods for the reform of state-owned enterprises.  The project is addressing enterprise\nreform  measures  for  the  following:  (i)  corporate  restructuring  and  transformation  of  medium-size  enterprises,\n(ii) management  development,  and  (iii)  retraining  and  reemployment  of  laid-off  state  enterprise  employees.  The\ndevelopment  of  private  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  is  also  a  priority.  Lessons  learned  have  been\nconsidered in designing the Project.\n\n24 TA 2670-PRC: Strengthening of Enterprise Reform in Anhui Province, for $600,000, approved on 25 October 1996.\n25 Of the four subproject enterprises under Loan 1491-PRC: Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Industrial\nPollution Abatement (footnote  20),  only  one  has  not  made  adequate  progress  on  enterprise  reform  because  the\nenterprise has not demonstrated three consecutive years of profit.\n\n\f13\n\ninformation, and incentive system; and (iv) training the board, management, and employees to\nimplement  restructuring  (operational,  organizational,  labor,  and  financial)  while  measuring  the\nresults in terms of increases in factor productivity, profitability, and in rate of return on capital.\n\n3. \n\nPromotion of Cleaner Production\n\n42.\nThe  Government's  10FYP  on  environmental  protection  prioritizes  CP  as  a  mechanism\nfor  pursuing  sustainable  development  especially  in  the  industry  and  energy  sectors.  The\nGovernment  is  shifting  its  pollution  abatement  efforts  from  \u201cend-of-pipe  control\u201d  toward\nprevention at source. MBIs are considered as a major means to achieve the objective. ADB is\nplaying  a  major  role  in  helping  introduce  CP  through  a  TA  cluster  with  six  subprojects.  26\nSubproject  1  developed  a  policy  package  for  promoting  CP,  while  subproject  2  and  3  are\nassisting  the  Government  in  establishing  a  national  network  for  CP  technology  transfer  and\ndrafting the CP law. The draft will be submitted to the National People's Congress at the end of\n2001. The law will provide a legal basis for promoting CP. The other three subprojects (4, 5 and\n6)  will  assist  in  developing  CP  technology,  environmental  management  in  CP  and  financing\nmechanism  for  CP  in  town  and  village  enterprises.  ADB  has  also  provided  assistance  in\nestablishing successful CP transfer centers,27 which have spread to two provinces under the TA\ncluster.\n\nInvestments  promoting  CP  initiated  under  the  Project  are  a  result  of  these  policy\n43.\ndevelopments.  ADB  will  continue  to  pursue  dialogue  for  introducing  and  mainstreaming\nenvironmental  audits,  encouraging  the  adoption  of  best-available  technology,  and  promoting\nenvironmental awareness and environment-friendly behavior among consumers and producers.\nAPG  recognizes  that  further  investments  are  required  on  the  use  of  cleaner  fuel,  improved\nenergy  efficiency,  and  promotion  of  CP  technologies.  In  this  regard,  APG  is  pursuing  various\noptions  including  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  that  will  expand  investments  through  an\nacid rain control fund for promoting CP technologies.\n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n44.\nMost  enterprises  in  Anhui  lack  knowledge  of  and  expertise  in  modern  enterprise\nmanagement. Some management staff benefited from mini-master\u2019s in business administration\n(MBA) or executive education training offered at local universities; more managers could benefit\nfrom  similar  training.  The  research  and  development  capabilities  of  enterprises  need  to  be\nstrengthened to promote efficiency improvement programs and be better attuned with state-of-\nthe-art  technical  innovations.  During  project  processing,  the  importance  of  allocating  sufficient\nloan funds for developing human resources and to enable them to adopt modern management\nprograms  and  practices  was  stressed.  Each  subproject  includes  management  training\nprograms,  organizational  restructuring  plans,  and  enterprise  governance  procedures  in  their\nstrategic  restructuring  plans.  Each  subproject  will  allocate  a  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  for\nupgrading  the  management  information  system  along  with  other  institutional  strengthening\nactivities.  Further,  appropriate  human  resource  development  activities  will  be  undertaken  for\noverall project management. An important capacity-building component of the Project relates to\nthe purchase of equipment and human resource development to establish an environmental and\nacid rain monitoring network in the project area.\n\n26  TA  3079-PRC: Promotion of Cleaner Technology (Cluster),  for  $3.5  million,  approved  on  29  September  1998,  is\n\n27 TA 2434-PRC: Establishing a Center for Transfer of Environmentally Sound Technology, for $550,000, approved\n\n                  \n\nADB\u2019s first TA  cluster.\n\non 31 October 1995.\n\n\f14\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n45.\nThe Project is designed to reduce acid rain in Anhui, a relatively poor province with a per\ncapita GDP that is only 72 percent of the national average. The air quality in the Yangtze River\nValley has deteriorated to harmful levels. Without intervention, air quality will further deteriorate\nand  acid  rain  frequency  will  increase,  with  serious  negative  implications  for  public  health  and\neconomic  development.  APG  is  implementing  an  acid  rain  control  plan  to  address  these\nconcerns.  APG  has  demonstrated  strong  sense  of  ownership  of  the  Project  by  identifying\nsubprojects  with  adequate  provision  for  local  currency  financing.  A  cause-effect  and  project\nobjective tree analysis is found in Appendix 4.\n\n46.\nThe  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  provincial  acid  rain  control  strategy,  and  is\nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  clean  up  the  environment  by  improving  air  and\nwater  quality  in  the  acid  rain  control  zone  of  the  PRC.  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  to\nsupport  measures  for  environmental  improvement  and  natural  resource  management  in  the\nPRC. The Project, if approved, will be the eighth environmental improvement project supported\nby  ADB  in  the  PRC  and  the  first  to  focus  on  acid  rain  control.  It  will  also  be  the  first\nenvironmental  improvement  project  to  be  implemented  solely  in  secondary  cities  (Guichi,\nHuangshan, Tongling, and Wuhu).\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n47.\nThe main objective of the Project is to improve the ambient air quality and reduce acid\nrain to improve the environment in the Yangtze River Valley in Anhui Province. The Project will\npromote  CP,  reduce  waste,  improve  energy  efficiency,  improve  the  environment  in  ecological\nsites,  and  support  institutional  strengthening  for  environmental  management  and  enterprise\ngovernance.\n\n48.\nThe Project has three main components: (i) six CP promotion subprojects undertaken by\nindustrial enterprises, (ii) three environmental improvement and acid rain damage rehabilitation\n(EI-ARD)  subprojects  in  ecologically  protected  areas  (Huangshan  and  Jiuhua  mountains),  and\n(iii)  one  institutional  strengthening  component  to  be  undertaken  by  provincial  and  local\nenvironmental agencies and subproject enterprises. The subprojects will reduce SO2 and other\ngases causing acid rain through the use of CP technology, improved energy efficiency, reduced\nwaste,  and  technology  advancements;  and  will  improve  environmental  management  and\nrehabilitate acid rain damage.\n\nAs  part  of  the  ADB-funded  project  preparatory  TA,  all  subprojects  proposed  under  the\n49.\nacid rain control plan were reviewed and a shortlist of subprojects was established. Shortlisting\nwas  based  on  willingness  to  make  investments  in  acid  rain  control  and  environmental\nimprovement  activities,  relative  contribution  to  SO2  emission  reduction  and  environmental\nimprovement, and location and managerial advantages. In the second stage, a comprehensive\nenterprise-level  assessment  of  the  subprojects\u2019  ability  to  perform  using  market-based\napproaches  under  enterprise  reform  and  macroeconomic  uncertainties  was  undertaken.  Many\nfactors\u2014financial,  environmental,  and  cost-effectiveness\u2014were  considered  in  the  evaluation.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  followed  a  rigorous  evaluation  process,  which  examined  financial,\neconomic and social aspects, including counterpart funding availability, enterprise viability and\nsustainability,  and  enterprise  management  capabilities.  The  six  industrial  enterprises  for\n\n\f15\n\npromoting CP were selected based on the results of this overall assessment. Three ecological\nsubprojects  at  two  sites  for  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain  damage  rehabilitation\nwere  selected  based  on  their  ecological  importance,  unique  biodiversity,  and  national  and\ninternational significance.\n\n1.\n\nCleaner Production Enterprises\n\nThe  six  CP  subprojects  will  entail  investments  to  reduce  SO2  and  other  gases  causing\n50.\nacid  rain  through  CP,  reduced  waste,  technology  advancements,  and  improved  energy\nefficiency. \n\n51.\nAnhui  Tongdu  Copper  Limited  Company  (ATC).  The  subproject  will  upgrade  the\nsmelter/blast  furnace  system  for  producing  blister  copper  (65,000  t/yr),  electrolytic  copper\n(15,000  t/yr),  and  associated  by-products;  and  install  a  double  conversion  and  double\nabsorption process to replace the current single conversion and single absorption process. This\nwill result in a 38 percent (14,890 t/yr) reduction in SO2 emission in Tongling city.\n\n52.\nChizhou  Non-Ferrous  Metals  Group  Company  (CNM).  The  subproject  will  upgrade\nthe  main  process  line  for  producing  electrolytic  copper  (20,000  t/yr  with  a  more  efficient\ntechnology),  capture  SO2  emissions  for  conversion  to  high-quality  sulfuric  acid,  and  relocate\nprocess  lines  away  from  a  residential  area  and  toward  a  new  industrial  zone.  CNM\u2019s  SO2\nemissions (6,291 t/yr) account for about 61 percent of the total SO2 emission (10,313 t/yr) in the\ncity of Chizou. The subproject will reduce SO2 by 59 percent (6,040 t/yr) and eliminate the threat\nposed by toxic metal emission.\n\n53. Wuhu  Feiying  Wood  Chemicals  Limited  Company  (WFW).  The  subproject  will\nrelocate  the  chemical  plant  from  a  residential  area  to  the  Wuhu  Industrial  Development  Zone;\neliminate current high pollution processes and products, and use state-of-the-art CP technology\nto  produce  three  industrial  chemicals  (paraformaldehyde,  formaldehyde,  and  acrylic  impact\nmodifiers).  WFW  is  the  largest  source  of  water  pollution  and  the  third  largest  source  of  air\npollution in Wuhu City. Its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and SO2 discharge account for 14\npercent and 6 percent, respectively, of the total in Wuhu City. The subproject will reduce SO2 by\n6 percent (1,372 t/yr) and eliminate the largest pollution threat to municipal drinking water.\n\n54. Wuhu  Hengchang  Copper  Refinery  Company  (WHC).  The  subproject  will  introduce\npyro-smelting  furnaces  and  establish  a  state-of-the-art  refinery  furnace  and  automatic  copper\ncasting system; replace the blast furnaces with an advanced oxygen-enhanced anode furnace;\nand add auxiliary systems for producing electrolytic copper (75,000 t/yr) and commercial copper\nproducts  (35,000  t/yr),  polished  copper  bars  (21,000  t/yr),  copper  sheets,  and  600  km/yr\ntelecommunication  cables).  WHC  is  the  third  largest  SO2  source  in  Wuhu,  accounting  for  15\npercent (3,308 t/yr) of the total SO2 emissions in the city. The subproject will reduce SO2 by 9\npercent (1,952 t/yr). Acidic wastewater discharges are 1.5 million t/yr.\n\n55. Wuhu  Shanjiang  Chemicals  Limited  Company  (WSC).  The  subproject  will  upgrade\nthe caustic soda production line from the diaphragm process (35,000 t/yr) to the ion-membrane\nprocess (30,000 t/yr); construct a cogeneration station to supply electricity and process heat in\nthe  Wuhu  Industrial  Development  Zone  and  replace  29  small  boilers;  and  relocate  dyestuff\nprocessing to reduce water pollution. WSC is a large emitter of SO2, accounting for 22 percent\n(4,981  t/yr)  of  total  emission.  The  subproject  will  reduce  SO2  by  20  percent  (4,533  t/yr)  in  the\ncity.  It is also the fourth largest water pollution source in the city.\n\n\f16\n\n56. Wuhu  Zhengxing  Materials  Limited  Company  (WZM).  The  subproject  will  demolish\nthe current steel making system to eliminate air pollution and high energy consumption (annual\ncapacity of 400,000 t pig iron, 600,000 t sintered ore, and 175,000 t coke); modify the current\niron  making  system,  use  iron  produced  to  make  ductile  iron  pipe  and  fittings;  expand  the\ncogeneration system to fully use the combustible gas from the iron furnace and coking process;\nand construct a system for treating wastewater and processing water for reuse. It is the second\nlargest SO2 emission source in Wuhu and accounts for 18 percent  (4,104 t/yr) of the total SO2\nemissions  in  the  city.  In  addition,  WZM  discharges  6.39 million  t/yr  of  wastewater  into  the\nupstream  of  the  drinking  water  source  of  Wuhu  City  including  89 t/yr  of  phenol  and  8.6  t/yr  of\ncyanide.  The  subproject  reduce  SO2  by  11  percent  (2,545  t/yr),  and  eliminate  phenol  and\ncyanide discharges and improve energy efficiency and water quality.\n\n2.\n\nEI-ARD Entities\n\n57.\nEnvironmental  improvement  and  rehabilitation  of  acid  rain  damage  in  the  Huangshan\necological site will be undertaken by the Huangshan Electric Company (HEC) and Huangshan\nWater  Company  (HWC).  The  Jiuhua  Tourism  Group  Company  (JTC)  will  be  responsible  for\nenvironmental  improvement  work  in  Jiuhua  ecological  site.  Rehabilitation  work  for  acid  rain\ndamage including improvement in electricity supply, water supply, sewage treatment, forest fire\nprotection  in  protected  areas,  and  solid  waste  management  to  reduce  impacts  of  local  air\nemissions,  will  be  the  main  focus.  Improvements  in  environmental  monitoring  systems  to\ndocument acid rain impacts will also be undertaken at the two sites.\n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n58.\nInstitutional strengthening will benefit APG and the subproject enterprises. First, at APG-\nlevel activities will focus on institutional strengthening of the project management office (PMO),\nAEPB,  APFB,  APPC,  and  their  municipality-level  counterparts  and  all  subproject  enterprises.\nThe second task includes capacity building for improved operations management systems and\nprovision  of  training  for  human  resource  development  at  the  enterprise  level  (Appendix  5).  At\nthe  subproject  enterprise  level  there  will  be  two  main  activities:  (i)  introduce  and  improve\nemerging  corporate  governance  by  creating  diversity  in  the  board  of  directors  and  appointing\ncross-industrial and cross-regional members; and (ii) strengthen overall financial and operations\nmanagement,  as  well  as  financial  reporting  systems  of  subproject  enterprises.    At  the  APG\nlevel,  there  will  be  four  main  tasks:  (i) strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the  PMO  in  project\nadministration;  (ii)  assist  APG  in  understanding  ADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures  and  reporting,\ninternational specifications, and tendering procedures including contracting, quality control, and\nproject performance monitoring system; (iii) strengthen environmental policy-making capabilities\nof  APPC;  (iv)  improve  financial  management  skill  at  APFB;  (v)  improve  environmental\nmonitoring  capabilities;  and  (vi)  strengthen  public  health  and  environmental  awareness\nprograms in AEPB, and other relevant organizations.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  $325  million  equivalent  including  taxes,  physical  and  price\n59.\ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. Foreign exchange costs are\nestimated  at  $147  million  (45  percent)  and  local  currency  costs  at  $178  million  equivalent\n(55 percent).  A  summary  is  given  in  Tables  1  and  2,  with  details  in  Appendix  6.  About  79\npercent  of  the  project  cost  is  for  CP,  16  percent  for  EI-ARD,  and  5  percent  for  institutional\nstrengthening.\n\n\f17\n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost\n($ million)\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nComponent\nA.

The  ADB  loan  in  US  dollars  will\n61.\ncome from ADB's ordinary capital resources and will carry an interest rate to be determined in\naccordance with ADB's LIBOR-based loan facility, a 1 percent front-end fee charged upon loan\neffectiveness,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.  The  Borrower  will  make\nthe  loan  proceeds  available  to  APG  for  relending  to  the  subproject  enterprises  through\nsubsidiary loan agreements. The loan for six CP enterprises will have a repayment period of 14\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years  and  for  EI-ARD  subproject  enterprises  with  an\namortization  period  of  20  years  including  a  4-year  grace  period.  Relending  for  the  institutional\nstrengthening component will be similar to the respective subproject enterprises\u2019 terms. Lending\nterms for APG\u2019s institutional strengthening component will be similar to those for the loans. The\nsubproject  enterprises  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies  for  their  respective  subprojects.  The\nforeign exchange  and interest  rate variation risks will be borne by the implementing agencies.\nThe  loan  proceeds  for  institutional  strengthening  will  be  made  available  to  PMO  through\nbudgetary  allocations.  All  subprojects  will  generate  sufficient  cash  to  buy  the  required  foreign\nexchange  currencies  to  service  the  loan.  The  project  implementation  agencies  (PIAs)  will  be\nprovided  with  necessary  foreign  exchange  for  ADB  debt  service  and  the  PIAs  will  bear  the\nforeign  exchange  risk.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  repayment  of  loan  proceeds\nwill  be  utilized  by  APG  for  financing  other  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain  control\nprojects. APG will keep ADB informed of the progress of utilizing such funds.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management Office\n\nThe  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  has  been  established  for  the  Project.  APG,\n62.\nthrough the PMO, will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. The PMO is headed by a\ndirector  and  comprises  senior  representatives  from  APFB,  AEPB,  and  APPC.  The  PMO's\nresponsibilities include (i) supervision, overall coordination, macrolevel project management and\nmonitoring including implementing policy reforms and other institutional measures; (ii) preparing\nthe annual budget and monitoring the use of loan proceeds; (iii) project-wide quality control and\nassurance; (iv) preparing procurement-related documents, bid evaluation and recommendations\nfor contract awards; reporting progress to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), relevant government\n\n\f19\n\nagencies,  and  ADB;  (v)  cost  management,  assessing  project  impact  and  environmental\nimprovement; (vi) supporting interagency coordination and procurement; (vii) facilitating training\nand  human  resource  development;  and  (viii) ensuring  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and\nreporting requirements.  The personnel skills mix of the PMO will need to be adjusted from time\nto time to reflect the needs of the various phases of project implementation.\n\n2.\n\nProject Implementation Office\n\nits  director  and  staffed  by  adequate  personnel \n\nThe  six  CP  enterprises  and  the  three  EI-ARD  enterprises  will  be  the  PIAs  of  their\n63.\nrespective  subprojects.  Each  subproject  has  established  a  project  implementation  office  (PIO)\nheaded  by \nto  supervise  day-to-day\nimplementation of the subproject. The PIOs will be responsible for administrative, financial, and\ntechnical  supervision  of  the  subprojects  and  their  implementation.  The  PIOs  will  manage  (i)\nregular  implementation  of  their  components,  engagement  of  consultants,  and selection  of\ncontractors; (ii) facilitate ADB\u2019s approval for procurement and related documents; (iii) evaluate\nbids  and  recommend  award  of  contracts;  (iv)  prepare  and  submit  quarterly  reports  on  the\nsubprojects,  and  audited  financial  statements  of  the  enterprise  to  ADB;  (v)  procure  equipment\nand  materials  financed  under  local  currency  funds;  (vi)  manage  and  report  on  the  human\nresource  development  programs;  (vii)  supervise  civil  works,  installation,  and  commissioning  of\nthe subproject facilities; and (viii) liaise with concerned Government agencies as required.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation\n\n64.\nThe Project will be implemented over four years starting in January 2002 (Appendix 7).\nPreparatory  work  began  in  May  2001  with  the  drafting  of  bidding  documents  that  will  be\ncompleted by early 2002. Procurement, construction, and installation work will take about three\nyears, while commissioning will take about 9-12 months. The subprojects will be completed by\nDecember 2005 and the loan will be closed in June 2006. International firms will be engaged to\n(i)  supervise  detailed  engineering  design  that  will  be  carried  out  by  local  design  institutes,  (ii)\nsupply  key  engineering  process  and  equipment,  (iii)  supervise  equipment  installation  and\ncommissioning  to  be  carried  out  by  local  construction  companies  or  the  workforce  of  the\nsubprojects, and (iv) arrange for international training. The engineering contractors will also be\nresponsible for securing process performance guarantees.\n\n65.\nThe  designs  for  the  subprojects  will  include  performance  specifications,  requirements,\nand  criteria.  The  engineering  contractors  will  supervise  the  preparation  of  detailed  designs  of\nthe processes and related equipment.  This will help ensure that the designs, performance, and\nrelated  guarantees  are  the  responsibility  of  a  single  supplier.  Similarly,  each  engineering\ncontractor as part of the bid will provide specialized technical support during installation, start-\nup, and commissioning.  The equipment and processes will be tested during commissioning to\nensure that performance criteria have been met, and the supplier will resolve any problems.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nAPG  will  engage  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  according  to  ADB's\n66.\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  two  purposes:  (i)\ninstitutional strengthening, and (ii) project implementation. Institutional strengthening will require\n30  person-months  of \ninternational  and  30  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Project\nimplementation  will  require  10  person-months  of  international  and  10  of  domestic  consulting\nservices.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  institutional  strengthening  and\nproject  implementation  are  in  Appendix  8.  The  work  for  institutional  strengthening  includes\n\n\f20\n\nfinancial  management, \n\ntechnology\npromotion  of  corporate  governance, \ndevelopment,  and  demand  and  market  analysis.  Required  work  for  project  implementation\nincludes (i) reviewing the adequacy of the preliminary design, (ii) checking the specifications of\nequipment  and  materials,  (iii)  ensuring  quality  control,  and  (iv)  ensuring  incorporation  of\ninternational  codes  and  standards.  The  required  expertise  includes  design  engineering,  bid\npreparation  and  evaluation,  technology  assessment,  enterprise  restructuring,  cost  accounting,\nfinancial management, and information technology systems development.\n\ninformation \n\nUsing  their  own  funds,  the  enterprises  will  have  engaged  the  services  of  local  design\n67.\ninstitutes to provide consulting services relating to preliminary design and detailed engineering\nwork. These institutes are major organizations in their respective fields and are experienced in\nengineering and construction of chemical and industrial plants and protected area management\nsystems.  They  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  previous  experience  and  satisfactory\nperformance  in  similar  projects,  and  capability  to  provide  the  required  services.  These\ninstitutions  will  (i)  prepare  preliminary  designs  of  the  respective  subprojects;  (ii) prepare  basic\nspecifications  of  equipment  and  materials,  and  bid  documents;  (iii)  assist  the  enterprises  in\ntechnical  bid  evaluation;  (iv)  prepare  detailed  design  under  the  supervision  of  the  engineering\ncontractors; (v) assist the enterprises and the engineering contractors in supervising equipment\ninstallation and construction of the facilities provided under the subprojects; and (vi) assist the\nenterprises  and  engineering  contractors  in  commissioning  the  facilities  and  performing\nguarantee tests.  These consultants will engaged using procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\n5.\n\nProcurement\n\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following  ADB's  Guidelines for\n68.\nProcurement. In  accordance  with  government  policy,  each  PIA  will  engage  a  procurement\nagency or agencies for assistance in procurement-related matters. The equipment and services\nfinanced from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured through international competitive\nbidding  (ICB)  or  international  shopping  (IS)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent\nof  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  based  on  ICB  procedures.  Those  valued  at  less  than\n$500,000 will be awarded on IS procedures. Equipment packages with estimated values below\n$100,000  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase.  Civil  works  which  are  located  in  scattered\nand  isolated  locations  and  are  unlikely  to  attract  any  foreign  bidders  will  be  procured  through\nlocal competitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. To facilitate project\nimplementation,  advance  procurement  action  was  approved \ninternational\nengineering  contractors  and  acquiring  process  licenses  and  critical  equipment.  A  list  of  the\ntentative procurement packages is in Appendix 9.\n\nfor  engaging \n\n6.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n69.\nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the\nneed  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of\nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  or\ncorruption  is  discovered.  ADB\u2019s  program  for  the  PRC  includes  assistance  to  the  Government\nthat will improve governance and provide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the\nlonger  term.  In  1998,  ADB  approved  assistance  to  the  Government  to  develop  detailed\n\n\f21\n\nguidelines for selecting and engaging consultants,28 which increase transparency, take account\nof  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  and  provide  for  equal  opportunity  competition.\nThe  resulting  draft  guidelines  were  well  received  by  the  Government.  ADB  is  providing\nassistance to strengthen the Government\u2019s auditing system to conform with the requirements of\nthe  Audit  Law  and,  as  far  as  practicable,  international  auditing  standards  by  (i)  formulating\ngovernment  auditing  standards  and  procedures,  and  (ii)  designing  and  implementing  an  audit\ntraining  program  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and\nprocedures  by  government  auditors.29  This  work  will  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to\ndetect  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB  has  also  provided  assistance  for  establishing  national\nprocurement regulations, implementing the Tendering and Bidding Law and related regulations,\nand  formulating  the  Government  Procurement  Law.30  These  laws  and  regulations  will  help\nensure  transparency  in  the  procurement  process  and  reduce  corruption.  In  line  with  these\nnational developments, the PMO and subproject enterprises have established an anticorruption\nsystem by preparing specific programs and targets, agreeing to establish an internal audit unit,\nand organizing training and workshops.\n\n7.\n\nDisbursement\n\n70.\nProceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard disbursement\nprocedures.  To  facilitate  disbursement  related  to  numerous  small  expenditures  involved  in\nimplementing the subprojects, an imprest account will be established after loan effectiveness in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Appropriate withdrawal applications and\ndocumentation  for  liquidation  of  advance  expenditures  will  support  disbursements  from  the\nimprest  account.  Such  documentation  will  show,  among  other  things,  that  (i)  goods  imported\nwere produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, and (ii) only eligible items were\nimported or purchased locally. The initial amount deposited in the imprest account will be up to\n$1.4 million. Liquidation of expenditures will be supported with full documentation. Statement of\nexpenditures may be used for reimbursement procedures and for liquidating expenditures from\nthe imprest account valued at $100,000 equivalent or less.\n\n8.\n\nHuman Resource Development\n\nThe management and staff of the enterprises will be trained in functional areas such as\n71.\nsubproject  management,  environmental  protection  and  pollution  control,  environmental\nmonitoring.  About  500  staff  will  receive  substantial  in-country  and  international  training  in  the\nrelevant  managerial  skills,  accounting,  information  technology,  technical  processes,  quality\ncontrol,  automation,  plant  operation,  energy  management,  environmental  protection,  and\npollution  control  monitoring.    The  enterprises  will  prepare  a  training  program  and  submit  it  to\nADB  for  approval  after  procurement  has  been  completed  and  the  training  arrangements  with\nengineering  contractors  have  been  made,  but  not  later  than  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness.\nThe  PIAs  will  ensure  that  the  recipients  of  international  training  financed  under  the  Project\ncontinue their services with their respective subprojects for at least one year after training. The\ntraining programs will focus on accounts and financial reporting, enterprise management, sales\nand marketing, product development, market research, and similar areas. Key executives of the\nagencies will be exposed to updated management tools and techniques to be able to respond to\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1998.\n\n28  TA  3138-PRC:  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Engagement  of  Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\n\n29 TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n30 TA 3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations, for $565,000, approved\non 14 June 2000; TA 3631-PRC: Formulation of the Government Procurement Law, for $525,000, approved on 20\nFebruary  2001;  TA  2845-PRC:  Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector,  for\n$565,000, approved on 20 August 1997.\n\n\f22\n\nthe  rapidly  changing  demands  of  the  marketplace.  Provision  has  been  made  for  computer-\nbased training and acquiring appropriate software.\n\n9.\n\nProgress Review\n\n72.\nThe  Project  will  be  supervised  through  regular  ADB  missions.  ADB  will  also  monitor\nimplementation of all project components through the quarterly progress reports. Starting from\nthe  first  quarter  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  enterprises  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  one  month\nafter  the  completion  of  each  quarter,  quarterly  progress  reports  on  implementation  of  the\nsubprojects.  The  reports  will  indicate  (i)  the  financial  status  of  the  subprojects;  (ii)  progress\nmade and problems encountered by the PIAs during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or\nproposed to remedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan\nreforms  and  environmental  mitigation  and  control;\ncovenants, \n(v) socioeconomic  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  mitigation  measures\nparticularly labor retrenchment and resettlement; and (vi) a proposed program of activities and\nexpected  progress  of  subproject  implementation  during  the  following  quarter.  The  EA  and  the\nPIAs, through the PMO, will furnish ADB with completion reports within six months after the loan\nclosure.    The  implementation  completion  report  will  review  the  planned  objectives  and  the\nachievements of the Project, including costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of\nall parties associated with project execution.\n\nincluding  enterprise \n\n73.\nDuring  implementation,  project  performance,  including  the  achievement  of  project\noutputs  and  attainment  of  development  and  environment  improvement  objectives,  will  be\nmonitored  through  the  use  of  annual  monitoring  reports  prepared  by  PMO.    The  first  annual\nmonitoring report will be submitted by December 2003, and the last by December 2005 or at a\nlater date  depending on  actual project completion.  In addition to the normal periodic reviews,\nADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  two  years  after  implementation\nbegins.  This  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation\nretrenchment,\nland  acquisition, \narrangements,  enterprise \nconsultation  with  affected  persons,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the\nagenda for policy reforms and capacity-building measures.\n\nresettlement, \n\nreform, \n\nlabor \n\n10.\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n74.\nTo  assess  the  contribution  of  the  subprojects  to  environmental  improvement,  APG  will\nprovide an annual project performance report to ADB for five consecutive years after the project\nfacilities are commissioned. The first such report will be submitted within six months after loan\nclosure.  The  report  will  be  based  on  individual  project  performance  reports  prepared  by  each\nPIA, which will assess the actual environmental improvements achieved as compared with the\ntargets.  The  assessments  will  measure  parameters  such  as  improvement  in  operational\nefficiency,  managerial  strength,  and  reduction  in  material  and  energy  consumption  and  air\npollution,  all  against  baseline  data.  The  report  will  assess  the  achievement  in  each  enterprise\nagainst the PRC's emissions and air quality standards. The report will include a summary of the\nreduction  in  the  emissions  attributable  to  the  Project,  and  a  summary  of  the  status  of  Anhui\u2019s\nenvironmental protection plan.\n\n75.\nSocioeconomic  changes  that  are  likely  to  occur  among  the  beneficiary  population  as  a\nresult of the Project will be monitored by APG in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Project\nPerformance Management System.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  APG,  through\nindividual  reports  prepared  by  the  PIAs  will  provide  ADB  with  a  report  on  benchmark\ninformation.  The  benchmark  information  will  contain  relevant  baseline  information  on  income\n\n\f23\n\nand  expenditure  patterns,  relevant  indicators  pertaining  to  health,  agriculture,  forestry,\nemployment, and perceived improvements in the environment. The information will come from\nsurveys  and  data  from  primary  and  secondary  sources.  Repeat  sample  surveys  will  be\nconducted  during  project  implementation  and  upon  project  completion  to  measure  these\nimpacts.  With  this  information,  APG  will  prepare  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  poverty\nreduction impacts of the Project and submit it to ADB within six months after loan closure. APG\nwill  also  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impacts  on  retrenched  workers  and  persons  affected  by\nresettlement and land acquisition as outlined in the labor retrenchment and resettlement plans.\nSpecial attention will be given to the socioeconomic conditions (including income, employment,\nhealth, and education) of affected persons dissagregated by gender. The data will be part of all\nreports that APG will submit to ADB.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1.\n\nOrganization and Management\n\nAPG will be the EA for the Project. The Project will be coordinated through the existing\n76.\nADB  PMO,  which  has  performed  satisfactorily  for  the  ongoing  Loans  1490/91  (footnote  18):\nAnhui  Environmental  Improvement  Project  for  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Industrial\nPollution  Abatement.  To  ensure  strong  coordination,  a  steering  committee  under  the  direct\nsupervision of the provincial vice-governor has been established. The PMO will function as the\nsecretariat  to  the  EA  and  steering  committee,  and  will  maintain  records  of  discussions,\ndecisions  made,  and  actions  taken,  in  addition  to  implementing  the  institutional  strengthening\ncomponent.\n\n77.\nThe  six  CP  and  the  three  EI-ARD  enterprises  will  be  the  PIAs  for  their  respective\nsubprojects, with responsibility for day-to-day implementation of activities. The PMO will be the\nPIA  for  institutional  strengthening  of  government  agencies.  All  PIAs  enterprise  have  begun\nrestructuring  in  varying  degrees.  Differences  exist  among  the  PIAs  enterprise  in  the  extent  of\nthe  formal  reform  path  traveled,  as  well  as  the  speed  of  the  emergence  of  a  market-based\ncorporate  culture,  and  adoption  of  modern  management  practices.  ATC,  one  of  six  PIAs\nenterprise,  has  adopted  a  corporate  form  of  LLSC  with  shares  listed  on  the  Shenzhen  Stock\nExchange. It employs 2,664 workers and is one of the largest enterprises in Tongling County.\nThe other five PIAs have established LLCs with the goal of converting to LLSCs in the future.\nCNM  and  WHC  currently  employ  1,594  and  4,000  people,  respectively.  Three  of  six  PIAs,\nnamely,  ATC,  CNM,  and  WHC,  are  part  of  group  company  structures.  The  majority  of  the\nshares of both ATC and WHC belong to a group company, while CNM is a group company in\nitself.  WFW  and  WSC  employ  346  and  1,080  people  respectively.  They  are  located  in  Wuhu\nCity Economic and Technology Development Zone. WZM has a workforce of 4,247. The three\nEI-ARDE enterprises\u2014HEC, HWC, and JTC\u2014are operating as 100 percent state-owned LLCs.\nJTC is a state-owned LLC that employs 512 people.\n\n2.\n\nPast Performance and Financial Projections\n\nSome  common  characteristics  of  CP  enterprises  are  (i)  low  profitability  and  liquidity,\n78.\n(ii) high  level  of  inventory  and  receivables,  (iii)  high  level  of  short-term  debts,  and  (iv)  lack  of\nknowledge of and expertise in modern enterprise management. Five of the six CP enterprises\nhave  recorded  generally  poor  financial  performance  in  the  past  few  years.  The  physical\nconditions  of  existing  machinery  and  equipment  are  poor,  technology  used  is  obsolete,  and\nenterprises  have  not  been  operating  at  full  capacity.    Material  wastage  has  been  high  and\nenergy  efficiency  has  been  low.  Managerial  weaknesses  along  with  obsolete  technology,\n\n\f24\n\nequipment, and other obstacles have resulted in high production costs, low sales, and low profit\nmargins for these enterprises.\n\n79.\nTo ensure financial viability, all six enterprises will undertake measures to improve their\noperational  and  organizational  structures,  as  agreed  upon  during  the  policy  dialogue  during\nproject  processing.  The  measures  are  included  in  the  restructuring  action  plans  of  the\nenterprises:  equity  infusion;  separation  of  noncore  activities;  preventing  income  transfer  to\nrelated  companies;  reducing  inventory,  accounts  receivable,  and  accounts  payable  turnover\ndays;  debt  repayment;  and  establishment  of  different  control  mechanisms  at  the  management\nlevel.  To  this  end,  the  subproject  enterprises  have  agreed  to  give  priority  to  developing  the\nmanagement  by  training  the  board  members  and  management  to  carry  out  the  appropriate\nrestructuring  effort.  Details  on  enterprise  reforms  and  restructuring  activities  are  given  in\nAppendix  3.  This  restructuring,  combined  with  the  reduced  operating  costs  resulting  from  the\ninvestment under the Project, will help make enterprises sustainable.\n\n80.\nAs a result of enterprise restructuring and project investments, the financial performance\nof the six CP enterprises is expected to recover during the next five years. It is then expected to\nprogressively improve as production levels and sales volumes increase and unit production cost\ndecreases  with  the  start  of  the  operations  of  the  subprojects.  To  ensure  their  overall  financial\nsoundness, each enterprise will maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of not more than 70:30, a current\nratio of not less than 1.0, and a debt-service ratio of not less than 1.0 from the effective date of\nthe loan agreement up to the first principal repayment date and not less than 1.3 thereafter. To\nensure that all CP enterprises can meet these requirements, shareholders of four of the six CP\nenterprises will provide the following equity infusions: WHC, Y150 million; WFW, Y100 million;\nWSC, Y147 million; and WZM, Y227 million. Part of these equity infusions will pay for the long-\nterm debts for WHC (Y70 million) and WZM (Y6 million). For CNM, Y25 million additional cash\nwill be obtained by selling the present site and using the proceeds for debt payment. CNM will\ntransfer Y10 million debt to the Kewei Non-ferrous Metal Company since this debt was originally\ntaken  for  this  subsidiary.    Based  on  these  conditions  and  requirements,  financial  projections\nwere made up to 2010. Table 4 summarizes the key financial indicators in 2010 compared with\nthose in 2000.\n\nTable 4: Financial Indicators of Subproject Enterprises, 2000 and 2010\n\nEnter-\nprise\n\nGross\nMargin\n\nOperating\nMargin\n\nCurrent\nRatio\n\nDebt-to\n-Equity\nRatio\n\nDebt Service\nCoverage\nRatio\n\nGross\nMargin\n\nOperating\nMargin\n\nCurrent\nRatio\n\nDebt-to-\nEquity\nRatio\n\nDebt Service\nCoverage\nRatio\n\n19.7\nATC\nCNM\n9.3\nWFW 10.3\n8.4\nWHC\n13.7\nWSC\n12.0\nWZM\n10.2\nHEC\n23.8\nHWC\n55.6\nJTC\n\n14.3\n6.3\n2.8\n5.5\n3.6\n1.1\n(1.7)\n(19.2)\n25.7\n\n23:77\n63:37\n15:85\n64:36\n49:51\n30:70\n30:70\n25:75\n17:83\n\n7.2\n2.5\n74.0\n1.5\n3.6\n1.7\n2.5\n1.0\n10.9\n\n17.8\n12.8\n22.0\n13.5\n38.6\n13.3\n25.3\n56.3\n48.1\n\n12.8\n10.5\n19.7\n11.0\n32.8\n7.8\n18.6\n48.8\n27.5\n\n2000\n\n2.3\n1.0\n3.2\n0.9\n2.1\n0.9\n1.3\n1.5\n1.4\n\n2010\n\n5.4\n5.3\n4.0\n6.3\n11.7\n1.7\n2.9\n7.7\n5.1\n\n7:93\n11:89\n21:79\n11:89\n15:85\n14:86\n33:67\n30:70\n21:79\n\n3.8\n3.3\n2.3\n5.0\n3.5\n2.1\n1.3\n1.3\n3.5\n\nCurrent  ratio  =  current  assets/current  liabilities;  debt  service  coverage  ratio  =  net  cash  flow  operations/debt  service\nrepayments; debt: equity ratio = (short term debt +  current portion of long term debt + long term debt/total equity); gross\nmargin % sales = gross margin/net sales; operating margin % sales = operating profit /net sales.\n\nJTC, one of three EI-ARD enterprises, recorded good financial performance in the past\n81.\nfew  years.  The  two  other  EI-ARD  subproject  enterprises\u2013HEC  and  HWC\u2013recorded  losses.\nElectricity,  water,  and  wastewater  tariffs  and  entrance  fees  for  HEC,  HWC,  and  JTC  were\n\n\f25\n\nprojected  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  operating  and  maintenance  costs,  interest\ncharges, and depreciation related to the subproject facilities by the first year of operation. Both\nHWC and JTC will apply a one-time connection fee for new water customers. The water tariffs\nfor HWC will increase by 3 percent per annum based on revenue requirements between 2002\nand 2010. In the case of JTC, revenues from water tariffs and other charges were forecast to\nincrease  by  6  percent.    The  wastewater  tariffs  for  JTC  and  HWC  are  based  on  80  percent  of\nmetered  water  consumption.  The  number  of  visitors  for  JTC  was  projected  to  increase  by  3\npercent  annually  between  2001  and  2010.  Revenues  from  visitors  will  cover  the  cost  of\noperations.\n\n82.\nThe  financial  projections  for  the  EI-ARD  enterprises  show  that  they  can  generate\nadequate  revenues  to  cover  operating  costs  and  debt  service  obligations.  The  realization  of\nprojected  revenues  for  HEC  and  HWC  subprojects  depend  on  raising  the  tariffs  and  equity\ninfusions.  HEC  and  HWC  will  provide  additional  equity  infusions,  Y47  million  and  Y70  million,\nrespectively, during the construction period. During the policy dialogue, it was agreed that HTC\nwill  provide  Y154.5  million  funds  to  HEC  (Y62.5  million)  and  HWC  (Y92  million)  from  2006  to\n2010. With the tariff adjustments and equity infusions, all three EI-ARD projects will be able to\nmaintain  debt-service  coverage  ratios  above  1.3  from  1  January  2006  onwards  (Table  4  and\nAppendix 10).\n\nTo  monitor  the  overall  financial  soundness  of  the  enterprises,  each  enterprise  will\n83.\nprepare annual financial statements consisting of income statements, sources and application of\nfunds, and balance sheets. Each enterprise will have financial statements audited in accordance\nwith internationally accepted auditing standards by external auditors acceptable to ADB, and will\nsubmit  to  ADB  not  later  than  six  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of\nfinancial  statements,  audited  accounts,  and  auditor\u2019s  report  in  English.  During  processing,\nADB\u2019s guidelines for preparing and submitting audited financial statements and accounts were\nexplained to the PIAs, and timely submission of audited financial statements and accounts and\nsanctions  for  failure  to  do  so  were  emphasized.  In  particular,  the  following  consequences  for\nnoncompliance  were  highlighted:  (i)  suspension  of  disbursements,  new  contract  awards  and\nimprest  account  replenishments  if  compliance  is  delayed  by  more  than  6  months;  and  (ii)\nsuspension of the loan if compliance is delayed by more than 12 months.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n84.\nThe Project will yield large environmental benefits, but some of the subprojects will have\nnegative  impacts.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  classified  as  environment-sensitive  category  B.  An\ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Project  and  IEE  for  each  subproject  have  been\nprepared.  A  summary  IEE  highlighting  the  main  findings  and  mitigation  measures  and  the\nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  were  circulated  to  the  Board  on  1  August\n2001. Appendix 11 shows the major environmental benefits associated with the Project.\n\nThe Project will reduce acid rain, improve environmental quality, and abate pollution in\n85.\nthe workplace through CP promotion, improved energy efficiency, and waste minimization. The\ntotal  amount  of  SO2  reduction  due  to  the  Project  is  about  31,332  t/yr  (44  percent  reduction  in\nurban  areas).  The  Project  will  also  reduce  coal  consumption  by  162,457  t/yr.  Wastewater\ntreated will be 15 million tons per year including a reduction in COD by 2,472 t/yr. SO2 reduction\nin  Chizhou,  Tongling,  and  Wuhu  cities  with  the  Project  will  be  59  percent,  38  percent,  and  46\npercent, respectively. While there is little quantitative study on the correlation between air quality\n\n\f26\n\nand health damage for workers, morbidity and mortality from lung cancer and other respiratory\ndiseases are higher than the national averages for workers in these enterprises and residents\nliving in the vicinity. Reduced acid rain and improved environmental quality will reduce damage\nto  infrastructure  and  ecosystems,  improve  human  health,  and  boost  agricultural  and  forestry\nproductivity.  Abatement  of  pollution  in  the  workplace  will  reduce  damage  to  workers\u2019  health,\nimprove  working  conditions,  and  enhance  labor  productivity.  The  Project  will  also  support\nenvironmental  improvement  activities,  including  rehabilitating  damage  due  to  acid  rain  in\necologically  protected  areas.  Investments  on  the  institutional  strengthening  component  will\nlocal\nthe  capacity \nenhance \nenvironmental agencies.\n\nthe  environment  and  monitor  provincial  and \n\nto  manage \n\n86.\nAdverse environmental impacts from each subproject will be minimized by selecting the\ntechnology  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  environmental  assessment\nreports.  Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  those  related  to  air  pollution,\ndegradation of water quality,  noise pollution, solid waste, and effects on plants and wildlife. In\neach case, the impact and the receptors (affected people, ecosystems) were studied. Wherever\nadverse impacts were identified, mitigation measures were specified. APG has assured that the\nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEEs/EIAs  and  the  summary  IEE  will  be\nincorporated  in  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  stages  of  the  Project.  Environmental\nmeasures,  on  which  action  needs  to  be  taken  by  contractors,  will  be  incorporated  in  the\ncontracts  for  civil  works.  During  the  construction  period,  PMO/APG  through  their  PIOs  in  the\ncities will supervise and monitor contractor compliance with the requirements for environmental\nprotection, and implementation of the environmental management and monitoring plan by PIAs.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n87.\nA  social  assessment  and  poverty  impact  analysis  were  undertaken  in  the  project  area\nduring  project  preparation.  Beneficiary  and  stakeholder  participation  was  sought  through\nappropriate  participatory  approaches.  Results  indicate  that  the  Project  will  have  significant\npositive social benefits for the target population. The local communities give high priority to the\nProject.  A  special  study  to  address  gender  concerns  related  to  environmental  awareness  was\nundertaken.31  Overall,  the  Project  requires  the  permanent  acquisition  of  about  20.3 hectares\n(ha).  This  includes  8  ha  and  8.5  ha  to  relocate  Wuhu  Feiying  Wood  Chemicals  and  Chizhou\nNon-Ferrous  Metals  respectively,  to  an  industrial  zone.  The  16.5  ha  in  the  industrial  zone  is\nvacant and does not need to be resettled. The remainder (3.8 ha) will be acquired by the Jiuhua\nsubproject  for  water  supply,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  treatment.  Land  acquisition  in  Jiuhua\nwill  affect  23  households  farming  1.3  ha  of  paddy.  The  affected  households  will  be  relocated,\ngiven  cash  compensation,  and  provided  livelihood  support  according  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  PRC\u2019s  Land  Administration  Law,  1998.  A  summary  of  the  short\nresettlement plan is in Appendix 12.\n\nAlthough \n\nthe  Project  will  generate  direct, \n\n88.\ntemporary  employment\nopportunities, it can also result in some loss of employment due to enterprise restructuring. For\nexample,  enterprise  restructuring  in  ATC,  CNM,  WFW,  WSC,  WZM,  and  JTC  is  expected  to\ninvolve the retrenchment of about 840 workers. Of these, about 800 will be redeployed and the\nrest will be given early retirement benefits consisting of 80 percent of their current salary for five\nyears. PIAs will prepare labor retrenchment plans for affected persons. Each plan will include\n\nindirect,  and \n\n                  \n\n31 The special study was undertaken as part of TA 5889-REG: Gender and Development, for $850,000, approved on\n23  December  1999.  Relevant  findings  regarding  the  need  for  environmental  awareness  campaigns  for  indoor\npollution and the need to monitor impacts on women have been incorporated in the project design.\n\n\f27\n\nmechanisms  for  redeployment  and  early  retirement.  It  will  also  have  special  sections  dealing\nwith (i) low-income persons with alternative livelihood options, and (ii) women workers.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\nFinancial analysis was conducted on an incremental basis in constant 2001 prices using\n89.\na 20-year economic life for the subprojects. The values of all inputs and outputs were based on\nprevailing  market  prices.  With-subproject  and  without-subproject  financial  projections  were\nprepared for each industrial enterprise. The differences between the two projections were used\nto determine the subproject\u2019s financial viability.\n\n90.\nFor  the  six  CP  subprojects,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  ranges  from  6.3\npercent  to  13.6  percent,  all  of  which  exceed  the  respective  real  weighted  average  costs  of\ncapital  (WACC)  (Appendix  13).  Sensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  the  FIRRs  are  generally\nadequate, although certain adverse scenarios cause the FIRRs to be lower than WACCs (Table\n5).  There  are  sensitivities  particularly  to  changes  in  output  price.  However,  conservative\nassumptions  on  capacity  utilization  and  output  prices  were  used  in  the  base  case  (Appendix\n13). In some cases, the rate of capacity utilization assumed was only 60-70 percent.  The FIRRs\nfor  the  three  EI-ARD  subprojects  range  from  7.3  to  10.0  percent.  The  potential  risk  and\nmitigation measures related to the financial performance of subprojects were discussed during\npolicy dialogue.\n\nTable 5: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n(percent)\n\nCase\n\nVariation\n\nATC\n\nCNM\n\nWFW\n\nWHC\n\nWSC\n\nWZM\n\nHEC\n\nHWC\n\nJTC\n\n6.3\n5.4\n2.7\n3.7\n5.3\n\n13.6\n12.4\n7.3\n8.9\n11.8\n\n7.7\n6.7\n4.1\n5.6\n6.4\n\n9.1\n8.0\n4.8\n6.1\n4.9\n\n10.6\n9.3\n8.8\n10.1\n8.8\n\n9.8\n8.7\n    3.5\n4.9\n8.4\n\n10.0\n8.7\n6.9\n9.8\n8.8\n\n9.2\n7.8\n8.7\n9.2\n8.4\n\n7.3\n6.1\n4.6\n7.2\n6.4\n\nBase Case\nCapital Cost\nOutput Price\nInput Price\nOne-Year Delay\nWeighted Average Cost of\nCapital (Real Terms)\n\n+10%\n-10%\n+10%\n\n4.4\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, ATC = Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company, CNM = Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals Group\nCompany, WFW = Wuhu Feiying Wood Chemicals Limited Company, WHC = Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Company, WSC =\nWuhu  Shanjiang  Chemicals  Limited  Company,  WZM  =  Wuhu  Zhengxing  Materials  Limited  Company,  HEC  =  Huangshan  Electric\nCompany, HWC = Huangshan Water Company, JTC = Jiuhua Tourism Group Company\n\n6.0\n\n4.6\n\n5.1\n\n4.9\n\n5.0\n\n4.4\n\n5.5\n\n5.1\n\n91.\nThe economic analysis of the subprojects was carried out on an incremental basis. The\nquantifiable  economic  benefits  attributable  to  the  six  CP  subprojects  include  (i) energy\nconservation  through  the  adoption  of  CP  technology;  (ii)  enhanced  efficiency  and  cost-\neffectiveness of production through operational modifications; and (iii) improved product quality\nwith introduction of CP technology, process improvements, and raw materials substitution. The\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculations  do  not  include  quantified  environmental\nbenefits.  The  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  20.4  percent.  The  EIRRs  for  CP  subproject\ninvestments  range  from  14.2  to  27.5  percent.  The  EIRRs  for  the  three  EI-ARD  subproject\ninvestments range from 19.7 to 23.9 percent. These figures are summarized in Table 6; details\nare in Appendix 14. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for increased capital cost, increased\noperation  and  maintenance  cost,  decreased  benefits,  and  construction  delay.  The  analysis\nshows that the Project is resilient under adverse conditions. Using the Monte Carlo simulation\n\n\f28\n\ntechniques, the risk analysis showed that the probability of the EIRR being below 12 percent is\nalmost zero.\n\nTable 6: EIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n(percent)\n\nVariation ATC\n14.3\n+10% 13.1\n+10% 11.1\n-10%   9.5\n13.8\n10.0\n\nCase\nBase\n1.

Acute  symptoms  of  particulate\nand  SO2  pollution  include  restricted  activity,  respiratory  illnesses,  and  exacerbation  of  asthma\nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic particulate and SO2 pollution is associated\nwith  bronchitis,  chronic  cough,  respiratory  illness,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  and\naggravated  asthma,  decreased  longevity,  and  lung  cancer.  Children,  the  elderly,  and  persons\nwith  asthma  and  cardiovascular  disease  are  most  susceptible  to  SO2  exposure.32  The  Project\nwill substantially reduce the emissions of toxic gases and other airborne particulate associated\nwith acid rain, wastewater, and other hazardous wastes. There are many other benefits, such as\nreductions  in  release  of  arsenic,  lead,  nickel,  copper,  formaldehyde,  methanol,  cyanide,  and\ncarbon  monoxide.  In  addition,  there  will  be  reductions  to  the  contaminant  load  of  the  Yangtze\nRiver and its tributaries. The resultant improvement in air and ambient water quality will improve\npublic health. Ancillary benefits of the improved technological process include improvements in\nthe  urban  water  supply  that  will  benefit  public  health  and  reduce  the  costs  of  urban  water\ntreatment.\n\n93.\nSince the Project area lies in a river valley, environmental improvement will benefit the\nlocal  population  directly.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  benefits  have  been  quantified.  The  main\nquantifiable  environmental  benefits  are  those  associated  with  the  significant  reductions  in\nemissions  (SO2,  TSP,  and  NOX)  causing  acid  rain  and  reductions  in  industrial  wastewater\ndischarges;  improvements  in  air  quality  at  the  facilities  due  to  CP  technology  and  process\nchanges; and global or transboundary benefits from reduced emissions of CO2. The Project can\ngenerate  the  following  benefits:  (i)  reduced  mortality  in  sensitive  populations  (asthmatics  and\nothers  with  preexisting  respiratory  diseases);  (ii)  reduced  morbidity  among  all  residents  (with\ncorresponding  increases  in  productivity  and  reduced  expenditure  on  both  medical  care  and\nmitigation);  (iii) increased  opportunity  for  outdoor  activities  that  are  sensitive  to  ambient  air\nquality  (recreation  and  some  productive  enterprises);  and  (iv)  greater  potential  to  attract  clean\n\n                  \n\n32  A  Beijing  study  showed  that  mortality  rate  increased  by  11  percent  for  every  doubling  in  SO2  concentration.  A\nsimilar  study  in  Shenyang  concluded  that  for  every  100  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  increase  in  SO2,  mortality\nincreased  by  2.4 percent.  NO2  in  the  air  forms  nitrogenated  organic  compounds,  which  have  been  shown  to  be\nmutagenic and carcinogenic. NO2 suppresses the immune system.\n\n\f29\n\nindustries into the area (tourism as well as knowledge-based industries), thereby enhancing the\ncities\u2019 development potential.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Impacts\n\n94.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  residents  through  improved  health\u2014lower  number  of  restricted\nactivity  days,  reduced  medical  expenses,  and  lower  mortality\u2014which  have  higher  impacts  on\nthe  poor  because  they  have  higher  health  costs  relative  to  their  income.  An  estimated  1.65\nmillion33  people  will  experience  improved  health  from  the  Project.  Children,  the  elderly,  and\nthose with asthma and cardiovascular diseases will have the highest health benefit due to their\nsusceptibility to air pollution. Health benefits accruing to the 9,700 enterprise workers, of whom\n10  percent  are  classified  as  unskilled  and  receive  low  incomes,  will  also  be  higher  due  to  the\npoor environmental working conditions currently existing in the enterprises.\n\n95.\nGender  assessment  shows  that  the  Project  will  have  beneficial  impacts  on  women.  A\npublic awareness campaign will specifically target women in creating environmental awareness.\nEnterprises have indicated that at least 30 percent of new staff positions will be for women. The\nProject will ensure that women are adequately represented in the various capacity building and\ntraining programs. The Project will also result in increased agricultural and forestry productivity,\nsectors that constitute the main source of income for the rural poor. Awareness that air pollution\nis  a  major  problem  that  results  in  poor  resource  productivity  is  high.    Medical  expenses  for\npollution-  related  diseases,  and  household-based  preventive  measures  and  repairs  to  avert\nadverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  rising.  However,  there  is  limited  knowledge  of  acid\nrain,  and  this  results  in  a  relatively  low  willingness  to  pay.  This  points  to  the  need  for  raising\nenvironmental awareness to improve the absorptive capacity of the target population.\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts\n\nReduced acid rain and environmental improvement will benefit all persons in the project\n96.\narea regardless of income levels. Acid rain reduction and environmental improvement are quasi-\npublic goods in the sense that beneficiaries will not be charged fees, nor do they need to invest\nin infrastructure to receive benefits (as in the case of utilities). In this respect, the Project allows\nthe poor to derive the same benefits as for the non-poor, if not higher. The Project will contribute\nto  poverty  reduction  through  (i)  health  benefits  from  air  pollution  reduction  and  environmental\nimprovement  for  the  poor  residing  near  the  enterprises,  and  health  benefits  from  improved\nworking  conditions  for  enterprise  workers;  (ii)  increased  incomes  from  higher  agricultural  and\nforestry  productivity  due  to  reduced  acid  rain;  and  (iii)  added  employment  opportunities.\nPotential benefits for enterprise workers are greatly improved working conditions. Of the 9,700\nenterprise workers directly affected by the CP subproject investments, over 1,000 are unskilled\nand  receive  low  income.  Water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  will  provide  clean  drinking\nwater  to  12,000  rural  persons  that  currently  have  no  access  to  piped  water,  and  remove  the\nthreat to main water intakes of Wuhu City\u2014which serves 180,000 persons. Promoting economic\ngrowth  through  investment  on  CP,  technology  transfer,  and  environmental  cleanup  will  further\ncontribute to poverty reduction.\n\n97.\nThe  Project  will  improve  crop  and  forestry  productivity  for  a  good  proportion  of  the\nproject area\u2019s agricultural population that number more than 13 million, of whom 408,000 have\nannual  incomes  of  less  than  Y1,000  per  capita.  Improved  agricultural  and  forestry  productivity\nwill help the rural poor generate more income. A significant number of the beneficiaries are from\n\n33 Based on the derivation of underlying receptor populations for regional damage areas (within 80 km).\n\n                  \n\n\f30\n\nlow-income households, and the Project will have positive impacts on poor individuals because\nlabor (influenced by health) and agricultural productivity are their most important resources. The\nProject  will  result  in  full-time  employment  for  400  within  the  subprojects;  full-time  employment\nfor 2,500 in related industries; and temporary construction employment of 7,000 person-years.\nOf the temporary employment, 70 percent will be for unskilled workers. These jobs can provide\nsupplementary income for the poor.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\n98.\nThe  main  risks  include  (i)  failure  on  the  part  of  APG  and  the  subproject  enterprises  to\ncontinue to implement environmental improvement and enterprise restructuring measures; and\n(ii) timely  availability  of  domestic  counterpart  funding.  The  risk  from  item  (i)  will  depend  on\nAPG\u2019s and subproject enterprises\u2019 continuing implementation of policy and institutional reforms\nwith  respect  to  environmental  improvement,  and  undertaking  required  enterprise  restructuring\nprocesses.  Addressing  the  potential  risks  associated  with  (i)  was  a  major  element  of  ADB\u2019s\npolicy  dialogue  during  project  processing.  Although  APG  and  subproject  enterprises  have\nshown strong commitment to continue implementation of these measures, there may be delays\nin implementation.  The delay could be due to several factors such as lack of resources, laws,\nimplementation  capabilities,  or  technical  expertise.  These  factors  were  carefully  assessed\nduring  project  processing,  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  including  suitable  legal\ncovenants were incorporated in the project design. Previous experience in similar ADB projects\nin  Anhui  Province  shows  that  ADB\u2019s  continued  dialogue  and  persuasion  can  reduce  this  risk\nsubstantially.  ADB  will  continue  to  discuss  policy  concerns  and  action  required  during  project\nimplementation. There will be review missions and consulting services to advise APG on project\ninstitutional  strengthening  aspects  during  project\nimplementation,  policy \nimplementation. Institutional strengthening measures built into the project design are related to\nmanagement expertise, training, financial autonomy, and other corporate governance issues to\nhelp the subproject enterprises address these issues. These measures will minimize the risk.\n\nissues,  and \n\n99.\nTimely  availability  of  domestic  resources  has  been  a  constraint  in  some  subprojects  in\nprevious  ADB-supported  projects  involving  enterprises.  The  difficulty  reflects  a  tightening  of\ncommercial  bank  credit  resulting  from  ongoing  reforms  that  call  for  lending  based  solely  on\ncommercial  considerations.  Each  enterprise  has  provided  firm  cofinancing  commitments\n(domestic loans, equity contribution, and other financing sources) for the relevant subprojects to\nADB\u2019s satisfaction. Further specific assurances that have been included require APG to provide\nadequate local currency funding to make up for any shortfall in cofinancing, without causing any\ndelay in loan disbursement and project implementation. Each subproject will be required to have\nin  place  satisfactory  cofinancing  or  alternative  arrangements  for  agreed-upon  amounts  as  a\ncondition for disbursing loan funds.\n\n100. Even if the subprojects are well-managed and market pricing is maintained, weaknesses\nin  the  management  and  governance  of  the  subproject  enterprises  may  create  inefficiencies.\nDuring  policy  dialogue,  these  risks  were  discussed,  and  it  was  agreed  that  enterprise\ngovernance would be given high priority in subproject management. This risk will be minimized\nthrough (i) the provision of management training, (ii) increased management independence, (iii)\nintroduction of better incentive systems, and (iv) increased managerial accountability. Variations\nin market-determined pricing for inputs and outputs, and frequent movements in market demand\nare  also  major  commercial  risks  associated  with  the  Project.  As  reflected  in  some  adverse\nscenarios  in  the  financial  analysis,  the  recalculated  FIRRs  can  go  below  the  WACCs  of  some\nsubprojects.    Such  a  risk  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  subproject  enterprises  and\nmitigation  measures  were  discussed  in  detail  during  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue.  The  measures\n\n\f31\n\ninclude both short- and long-term strategies. The short-term strategies include (i) reducing the\ninventory  period  to  improve  liquidity,  (ii)  strengthening  marketing  activities  to  increase  sales\nvolume, (iii) improving operation and maintenance to reduce cost of sales, (iv) timely transport\nof  inputs  and  outputs,  and  (v) purchasing  insurance  policies  to  cover  price  fluctuations.  The\nlong-term  strategies  include  (i) purchasing  derivative  instruments  including  forward  contracts,\noption  contracts,  and  cap  and  floor  agreements,  where  applicable;  (ii)  long-term  raw  material\nsupply  contracts  for  stable  supply;  and  (iii)  long-term  sales  and  purchase  with  agreed-upon\npricing  formulas.  Cash  deficiency  supports  will  also  be  available  from  parent  companies  or\nstakeholders.\n\n101. Cost  overruns  and  delays  in  implementation  also  constitute  a  potential  risk  for  the\nsubprojects.  To  minimize  these  risks,  the  project  design  incorporated  appropriate  precautions\nand  strategies  such  as  (i)  ensuring  enterprise  competitiveness  in  the  PRC's  increasingly\nliberalized policy regime and market economy; (ii)  restructuring existing enterprises to ensure a\nsound  financial  status;  (iii)  using  technically  and  commercially  proven  technology;  (iv)  using\ninternationally  reputable  and  reliable  contractors  and  suppliers;  (v)  making  lump-sum  turnkey\ncontracts,  where  applicable;  (vi)  obtaining  performance  guarantees  from  contractors  and\nsuppliers;  (vii)  obtaining  process  guarantees  from  licensers,  where  applicable;  (viii)  stipulating\nliquidity damage provision in contracts; (ix) strengthening enterprise management systems and\ninformation technology (IT) approaches; and (x) purchasing various insurance policies such as\nbusiness interruption insurance.\n\n102. Another potential performance risk is that targeted environmental improvements may not\nbe  achieved  because  of  lack  of  experience  in  the  revised  plant  design,  and  proper  operation\nand management. To minimize this risk, an institutional strengthening component is included in\nthe  Project.  The  use  of  internationally  experienced  consulting  firms  will  assure  the  smooth\nimplementation  of  the  institutional  strengthening  component.  The  PlAs  and  their  design\nconsultants will develop the performance specifications and criteria. The technical specifications\nfor  the  major  processes  and  equipment  will  be  prepared  by  the  prequalified  bidders  and\nincorporated  in  ICB  packages  for  compliance  by  the  manufacturers.  In  this  manner,  a  single\nparty/manufacturer/ supplier will be responsible for the performance, design, and guarantees of\nthe  processes  and  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  product.  These  strategies  will  reduce  the\npotential risk to acceptable levels.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  APG  have  confirmed  the  following  understanding,  in  addition  to\n\n103.\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n104.\n\nThe Government will ensure that\n\n(i)\n\nAPG,  through  AEPB,  will    (a)  obtain  approval  for  the  Anhui  Acid  Rain  Control\nAction Plan (ARCAP) within six months from the date of loan effectiveness; and\nincluding\n(b) undertake \nachievement  of  the  targets  for  SO2  emissions  and  acid  rain  control  detailed\ntherein.

Despite\nthese  programs,  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions  remain  high  and  acid  rain  is  frequent.  In\nresponse to this issue, the province has prepared the Anhui Acid Rain Control Region 10th Five\nYear Plan for SO2 Pollution Control.\n\nlimiting \n\n2.\nThe  plan  covers  six  cities:  Chaohu,  Huangshan,  Maanshan,  Tongling,  Wuhu,  and\nXuancheng for the period 2001-2005. The main objective is to reduce SO2 concentrations in the\nsix cities and to reach Class II ambient air levels. Projections show that during the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan (10FYP) period, the increase in SO2 emissions will be about 29,000 tons if no control\nis practiced. The increase will primarily be from the increased consumption of coal for fuel. The\n10FYP\u2019s  goal  is  a  20  percent  reduction  of  SO2  from  the  2000  levels  in  the  acid  rain  and  SO2\ncontrol zone. This highlights the importance of the plan in meeting the 10FYP objectives. Table\nA2.1 gives the main components of the plan.\n\nTable A2.1: Integrated Prevention and Control Plan on SO2 and Acid Rain\n\nMain Component\n\n1. Control SO2 emissions from \n\nindustrial enterprises\n\nItems\n\ni. Restrict SO2 emissions from industrial sources\nii. Restrict SO2 emission from thermal power plants\niii. Promote cleaner production to control SO2 pollution\niv. Limit SO2 emission from industrial stoves and kilns\nv. Reduce SO2 emissions in 13 key industrial enterprises\n\n2. Reduce sulfur content in coal \n\ni. Restrict high sulfur coal mining\n\nmines\n\n3. Strengthen urban energy \ninfrastructure construction\n\ni. Rationalize urban energy infrastructure distribution\nii. Improve energy use in Huangshan\n\n4. Supervision, management, and \n\ni. Coordinate provincial and local environment protection bureau \n\ninsurance measures\n\n(EPB)  planning\n\n5. Strengthen economic policies\n\n6. Strengthen scientific research \nmonitoring, supervision. and \nmanagement\n\nii. Ensure compliance with standards\niii. Strictly review new projects\n\nIntroduce SO2 levy system in the six cities\n\ni.\nii. Pilot application of emissions trading\n\ni. Establish air pollution, and acid rain monitoring network\nii. Support environment research programs\n\n3.\nThe  plan  lists  21  projects  with  a  total  investment  of  Y5.4  billion  ($650  million).  These\nprojects can reduce SO2 emission by 58,500 tons per year, which is over 90 percent of potential\nSO2 reduction in the six cities.

To\navoid  conflict  of  interest,  the  representative  will  be  selected  from  a  financial  institution  (excluding\nprovincial or national finance bureaus), which is not a lender to the enterprise. The board members\nwill be trained to understand not only, the company\u2019s financial results but also outside benchmarks.\nTo comply with the Company Law, all enterprises will appoint a member who will represent company\nworkers on the board. Currently, workers are not represented on the boards of enterprises.\n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nWithin \n\nis  ample  opportunity \n\nthe  marketing  and  sales  departments \n\nthe  existing  organizational  structure,  both \n\n2.\nfinancial  and  marketing/sales\ndepartments  are  weak  in  all  industrial  enterprises.    Some  financial  departments  have  accountants\ntotally  dependent  on  manual  counting  practices  and  without  the  benefit  of  information  technology.\nThere \ntheir\nprofessionalism.  Some  enterprises  do  not  have  human  resources  departments.  None  of  the  six\ncleaner production (CP) enterprises has research and development (R&D) divisions. As a result of\nthe policy dialogue, it was agreed that each enterprise will provide an action plan that details future\nsteps  for  organizational  restructuring  by  the  end  of  six  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The\nenterprise restructuring strategies for all enterprises will cover four key areas: (i) business strategy\nplans,  (ii)  corporate  governance,  (iii)  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  (iv) information\ntechnology upgrade. Twinning arrangements with domestic and international companies operating in\nthe same industry will play an important role in helping these enterprises absorb capability and keep\nup with the pace of recent technological developments.\n\nto  upgrade \n\n3.\nAll CP enterprises have a performance evaluation system, but none of the enterprises have\nset up a compensation committee among the board members to determine the level of performance-\nbased bonuses. The nonexistence of a well-designed performance information system prevents the\nmanagement from objectively calculating and allocating performance incentives to employees. The\npolicy  dialogue  resulted  in  the  agreement  that  each  enterprise  will  establish  a  performance\nevaluation committee and performance information system that will enable management to rely on\nincentives to improve performance, and productivity and profitability.\n\nB.\n\nFinancial Restructuring and Governance Improvements\n\n4.\nFinancial  restructuring  will  be  applied  through  workout,  distress  mergers/acquisitions  and\nbankruptcies, strategic investors; focusing enterprises on their core competencies through disposal\nof  nonviable  operations,  excess  assets  as  well  as  grouping  and  consolidation  of  sub-scale\noperations;  governance \nthrough  modified  governance  arrangements  and\ndiversification; and other transformation of ownership changes. The Project will bring together debtor\nenterprises,  their  owners,  and  their  creditors  in  planning  and  agreeing  on  voluntary  financial\nworkouts.    This  will  also  provide  valuable  insights  for  broader  programs  of  corporate  workout\ninvolving the resolution of nonperforming bank loans.\n\nimprovements \n\nIt  was  agreed  that  to  ensure  overall  financial  soundness,  each  enterprise  will  maintain  a\n5.\ndebt-to-equity ratio of not more than 70:30, a current ratio of not less than 1.0, and a debt-service\nratio of not less than 1.0 from the effective date of loan agreement up to the first principal repayment\ndate  and  not  less  than  1.3  thereafter.    All  CP  enterprises  have  agreed  to  comply  with  these\nrequirements. To ensure that all CP enterprises can meet these requirements, shareholders of the\nfollowing  CP  enterprises  will  provide  equity  infusion  as  agreed  upon  during  policy  dialogue  with\nADB:  Wuhu  Hengchang  Copper  Refinery  Company  (WHC),  Y150  million;  Wuhu  Feiying  Wood\nChemicals  Limited  Company  (WFW),  Y100  million;  Wuhu  Shanjiang  Chemicals  Limited  Company\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\n(WSC), Y147 million; and Wuhu Zhengxing Materials Company Limited (WZM), Y227 million. WHC\nand  WZM  will  pay  their  long-term  debt  after  equity  infusion  of  Y70  million  and  Y6  million,\nrespectively.  Chizhou  Non-Ferrous  Metals  Group  Company  (CNM)  will  obtain  Y25  million  cash\nthrough  the  sale  of  the  present  site  and  the  receipts  will  be  used  for  debt  payment.  It  was  also\nagreed that CNM will transfer its Y10 million debt to Kewei Non-Ferrous Metal Company since this\ndebt was originally taken for this subsidiary.\n\n6.\nAnhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company (ATC) is a major shareholder in several joint-stock\ncompanies.  As  a  result  of  the  policy  dialogue  it  was  agreed  that  ATC  will  decrease  its  majority\nownership  in  these  entities  to  less  than  50  percent.  Jiuhua  Tourism  Group  Company  (JTC)  has\ncontracted its noncore businesses to Jiuhua Tourism Development Shareholding Company (JTDSC)\nwhere  JTC  holds  75  percent.  During  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  JTC  agreed  to  decrease  its\nownership in JTDSC to less than 50 percent. Diversification of the shareholding system is necessary\nto  bring  in  new  investors  with  capital,  management  know-how,  technology,  and  access  to  wider\nmarkets, while the state\u2019s share is reduced. The gradual reduction of the state\u2019s share in enterprises\nwas also discussed and Government\u2019s agreement was obtained during the policy dialogue. As result\nof  the  policy  dialogue,  WFW,  WZM,  and  ATC  agreed  that  separation  of  noncore  activities  will  be\ncompleted  prior  to  loan  disbursements.    WHC  was  a  division  of  Wuhu  Hengxin  Copper  limited\nliability  company  (LLC),  which  has  numerous  subcompanies  and  noncore  activities.  The  policy\ndialogue led to the establishment of WHC as a new limited-liability company in June 2001.\n\nAdoption of prudent and more transparent management and reporting practices is necessary\n7.\nto  accurately  assess  the  future  financial  performance  of  enterprises.  The  Project  will  acquire\nadvisers  to  assess  the  needs  of  enterprises  for  efficient  and  transparent  management  reporting.\nBest practices will be reviewed to set up modern reporting techniques for these industries, not only\nthrough suitable software, but also with the purchase of appropriate hardware. The enterprises are\nurgently  in  need  of  computerization  and  proper  training.  Since  all  enterprises  aim  to  become  a\npublicly listed company in the future, Anhui provincial government (APG) and the enterprises agreed\nto  adopt  international  accounting  standards  by  31  December  2003.    It  was  also  agreed  that  all\nenterprises  will  develop  company  procedures  and  policies  for  credit  and  collection,  purchasing,\nhuman resources, sales, and marketing.\n\n8.\nAll  enterprises  are  required  to  improve  working  capital  requirements  such  as  inventory\nturnover  from  221  days  to  60  days,  accounts  receivable  turnover  from  124  days  to  30  days  and\naccounts  payable  from  165  days  to  30  days.    To  ensure  management  control  of  the  activities  of\nenterprises, it was agreed during the policy dialogue that an audit committee and a risk management\ncommittee will be established and internal auditors, financial controllers, and external auditors will be\nappointed. The accounting system must also be acceptable to ADB.\n\nC.\n\nManagement Development\n\nTo meet the requirements, it was agreed during the policy dialogue that all enterprises must\n9.\ngive priority to management development. Training the board, management, and the employees to\ncarry  out  the  right  restructuring  efforts  is  a  must.  Workshops,  mentoring  programs,  study  tour\nprograms, twinning arrangements, and mini-master in business administrations (MBAs) are activities\nthat  can  be  undertaken  for  management  development.

Projected  revenues  were  determined  by  multiplying  the  total  volume  of  production,\ntaking into account their anticipated capacity utilization on the basis of current performance by the\nanticipated  constant  unit  price.  The  Project  is  not  supporting  capacity  expansion  in  any  CP\nsubproject.  However,  certain  subprojects  are  implementing  minor  modifications  to  improve\nefficiencies  in  production.  Such  modifications  are  considered  in  the  projected  financial  statements\nand  in  the  financial  analysis.  Product  prices  are  based  on  end-2000  prices,  adjusted  to  reflect\nconservative  market  conditions.  Some  adjustment  in  intermediate  and  finished  products  from  the\nintroduction of cleaner technologies will result in some additional production (e.g., SO2 conversion to\nsulfuric acid) while substantially reducing emissions.\n\n2.\n\nCost of Sale\n\n2.\nCost of sales for the CP subproject enterprises comprises raw material costs, utilities, direct\nlabor, depreciation, and other factory overhead. The cost of raw materials and utilities are based on\ninput  quantities  required  for  each  unit  of  output.  Except  for  electricity,  other  variable  costs  are\nprojected to increase in line with output prices. Direct labor, depreciation, and other factory overhead\ncosts  are  allocated  to  products  based  on  percentage  of  sales.  Real  growth  rates  of  wages  and\nsalaries  are  expected  to  be  in  line  with  those  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The\ndepreciation rate is estimated at 5 percent annually, calculated on a declining balance basis, while\nother production costs are projected in accordance with the raw material costs. Operating expenses\ninclude  administrative  salaries  and  pensions,  indirect  depreciation,  amortization  of  intangible  and\ndeferred assets, marketing, and administrative costs. Marketing expenses are projected at 1 percent\nof  sales.  Interest  on  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  is  calculated  at  London  interbank\noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  rates  with  a  0.75  percent  commitment  charge  and  1  percent  front-end\nfee. The local loan rate is 6.2 percent. Taxes, other than value-added taxes (VAT) at 17 percent and\nincome  taxes,  are  the  education  surcharge  and  construction  tax,  calculated  as  3  and  7  percent  of\nincremental VAT, respectively.  The income tax is calculated at 33 percent.\n\n3.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n3.\nThe  future  average  working  capital  requirements  were  estimated  with  reference  to  each\nenterprise\u2019s  past  working  capital  requirements.  Fixed  assets  and  investments  are  recorded  in  the\nbalance  sheet at  their historical costs. For the CP subproject enterprises, an average depreciation\nrate  of  5  percent  per  annum  was  applied  to  this  average  fixed  asset  balance  to  derive  annual\ndepreciation.  Long-term  debt  is  based  on  the  actual  balances  as  of  31  December  2000,  with\nadditional long-term debt added as required for the Project. Capital expenditures represent planned\nexpenditures  to  be  incurred  by  the  enterprises  for  the  Project.  The  financing  plan  for  each  of  the\nenterprises as components of the Project is presented in Table A10.7.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10.7: Financing Plan (Y million)\n\nItem\nEquity\nDebt\n\nADB\nOther\n\nTotal\n\nATC\n180.1\n425.8\n215.8\n210.0\n605.9\n\nCNM\n72.2\n125.3\n90.9\n34.4\n197.5\n\nWFW\n105.6\n205.2\n160.2\n45.0\n310.8\n\nWHC\n108.2\n180.6\n150.6\n30.0\n288.8\n\nWSC\n110.0\n295.0\n201.7\n93.3\n40.5\n\nWZW\n163.1\n245.6\n187.6\n58.0\n408.7\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ATC  =  Anhui  Tongdu  Copper  Limited  Co.,  CNM =  Chizhou  Non-\nFerrous  Metals  Group  Co.,  WFW  =  Wuhu  Feiying  Wood  Chemicals  Limited  Co.,  WHC  =  Wuhu\nHengchang  Copper  Refinery  Co.,  WSC =  Wuhu  Shanjiang  Chemicals  Limited  Co.,  WZM  =  Wuhu\nZhengxing Materials Limited Co.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironmental Improvement and Acid Rain Damage Rehabilitation (EI-ARD) Subprojects\n\n1.\n\nIncome Statement\n\n4.\nThe  past  and  projected  financial  performance  of  the  EI-ARD  subprojects  are  presented  in\nTables  A10.8-A10.10.  Tourism  is  expected  to  increase  by  3  percent  per  year  in  the  Jiuhua  and\nHuangshan  sites  from  2006  until  2010  due  to  increased  capabilities  to  manage  more  visitors.  The\nthree EI-ARD subprojects will raise revenues to support the investment by charging tariffs for water\nusage, sewage treatment, solid waste disposal, and/or electricity supply. All subprojects will be the\nsole  suppliers  of  water,  sewage,  and  solid  waste  services  for  the  ecological  areas.  Revenues  will\nincrease  as  EI-ARD  subprojects  serve  more  visitors.  The  annual  increase  is  set  at  a  conservative\nlevel compared with the subprojects\u2019 five-year plan.\n\n2.\n\nCost of Sale\n\n5.\nCost  of  sales  for  subproject  operations  include  variable  processing  costs,  direct  labor,  and\ndepreciation.  Operating  expenses  include  administrative  salaries  and  pensions,  marketing  and\nadministrative costs. Interest on the ADB loan and other loans was treated in the same manner as in\nthe  EI-ARD  enterprises.  The  education  surcharge  and  construction  tax  are  calculated  as  a\npercentage of incremental VAT. Income tax is calculated at 33 percent of taxable income. VAT has\nno effect on the income of the Huangshan Tourist Company since all collections pass through the\nGovernment.\n\n3.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nWorking  capital  requirements  are  estimated  with  reference  to  their  past  levels,  increases\n6.\nrelated to the additional sales volume derived from the Project, and efficiency improvement expected\nand  required  by  ADB.  The  depreciation  rate  is  estimated  at  5  percent,  calculated  on  a  declining\nbasis. Capital expenditures represent the planned expenditures to be incurred by the subprojects for\nthe  Project.  The  financing  plan  for  each  of  the  subprojects  as  components  of  the  Project  is\npresented in Table A10.11.\n\nTable A10.11: Financing Plan (Y million)\n\nItem\nEquity\nDebt\n     ADB\n     Other\nTotal\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  HEC  =  Huangshan  Electric  Co.,  HWC = Huangshang  Water  Co.,\nJTC = Jiuhua Tourism Group Co.\n\nJTC\n40.8\n132.2\n82.2\n50.0\n173.0\n\nHEC\n38.4\n66.5\n48.5\n18.0\n104.9\n\nHWC\n57.7\n99.7\n72.7\n27.0\n157.4\n\n\fItem\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\nTable A10.1: Anhui Tongdu Copper Ltd.

12\n\nA.\n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\nOverall  the  Project  requires  the  permanent  acquisition  of  about  20.3 hectares  (ha)  of\n1.\nwhich 16.5 ha is in industrial zones and will not be resettled. The Jiuhua subproject will acquire\nthe remainder (3.8 ha) for water supply, wastewater, and solid waste treatment. This will affect\n23  households  of  87  persons  farming  1.3  ha  of  paddy  owned  by  Kecun  village.  The  village\ncollective has allocated land use to households under long-term contracts. It is responsible for\nrevising land-use contracts in the case of land acquisition.\n\nB.\n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress Participation\n\n2.\nPublic  consultation  and  information  dissemination  have  been  conducted  since  August\n1999 in line with the Chizhou government\u2019s plan to develop Kecun district.1 For the 23 affected\nfarming  households,  average  monthly  income  is  less  than  Y700  per  month.  On  average,  the\nland being requisitioned represents only 21 percent of total land farmed by the 23 households.\nThe village committee in coordination with the Jiuhua Shan Management Committee, the Jiuhua\nTown Government, and the Jiuhua Shan Land Administration Sector will address any appeals of\naffected persons.\n\nC.\n\nCompensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration\n\n3.\nWith counterpart funds, the enterprise will provide compensation to the village committee\nin accordance with national and regional laws and regulation:2 Y100,000/mu3 and Y3,000/mu for\nstanding  crop.  JTC  will  give  the  compensation  directly  to  the  affected  persons.  The  JTC\nenterprise will give priority to displaced farmers when hiring new employees for its expansion.\nFurther, the village committee is organizing training programs with support from the enterprise\nfor alternative forms of livelihood based on the development plans for Kecun.\n\nD.\n\nResettlement Financing, Implementation, and Monitoring\n\nPlanning,  implementation,  inspection,  and  assessment  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the\n4.\nvillage  committee,  in  coordination  with  the  enterprise.  Local  committees  and  groups  will  also\ndisseminate  information  and  conduct  public  discussions  for  affected  persons  to  facilitate\nresettlement. Budget sourced from counterpart funding is estimated at Y2.55 million.\n\n5.\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  based  on  the  Government-approved  land  acquisition\nand resettlement plans submitted by the subprojects. At the beginning of 2002, a monitoring and\nevaluation committee including, legal experts, and representatives of community organizations\nwill  be  formed.  Affected  persons  will  be  invited  to  attend  public  meetings  to  discuss  issues\nregarding the resettlement.\n\n                                                          \n1  Consultations  were  conducted  by  the  Kecun  village  committee  (composed  of  representatives  from  several  village\nteams  selected  by  the  village  congress),  the  Kecun  Development  Office,  and  Jiuhua  Tourism  Group  Company\n(JTC). A socioeconomic survey was conducted for farmers to be affected to provide information on the likely effects\nof land acquisition in terms of lost land, assets, and livelihood.\n2 Land Administration Law of PRC  1986,  amended  in  1998,  and Implementation Rules of the Land Administration\n\nLaw of PRC, Anhui Province.\n\n3 15 mu = 1 hectare.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe financial analysis of the cleaner production (CP) subprojects was carried out on an\n1.\nincremental  basis  (with  and  without  the  Project)  using  constant  prices  in  2001  yuan  (Y).  The\nproposed subprojects are assumed to begin operation in 2006. In addition to reducing pollution,\nthe  subprojects  will  generate  energy  and  material  costs  savings  as  well  as  improvement  in\ncapacity utilization. Capacity utilization with the Project in years 1, 2, and 3 onward are 75, 85,\nand 90 percent for Anhui Tongdu Copper Limited Company (ATC), Chizhou Non-Ferrous Metals\nGroup Company (CNM), and Wuhu Hengchang Copper Refinery Copmany (WHC); 60, 80, and\n90  percent  for  Wuhu  Zhengxing  Materials  Limited  Company  (WZM);  90,  90,  90  percent  for\nWuhu  Shanjiang  Chemicals  Limited  Company  (WSC);  and  70,  80,  and  90  percent  for  Wuhu\nFeiying  Wood  Chemicals  Limited  Company  (WFW).  Project  cost  estimates  were  converted  to\nreal  terms  by  removing  the  effects  of  inflation  and  devaluation  of  the  yuan.  Physical\ncontingencies are 5 percent of capital costs for all the subprojects.\n\nB.\n\nCleaner Production Subprojects\n\n2.\nElectrolytic  copper  prices  are  based  on  international  prices  as  quoted  on  the  London\nMetal Exchange (LME). There is a small premium in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) due\nto the country\u2019s supply and demand situation. Copper prices are volatile and have ranged from\nY13,545 to Y15,247 per ton in 2001. Since 1997, copper prices have ranged from Y11,243 to\nY16,647 per ton. The price of the company\u2019s copper raw materials also moves closely with the\nLME.  The  projections  for  ATC  assume  a  selling  price  of  Y15,339  per  ton.  ATC  will  realize\nincremental  production  efficiency  from  the  subproject  due  to  the  installation  of  top-blown\nsubmerged  lance  smelting  and  a  rotary  anode  furnace.  The  equipment  will  also  give  the\ncompany  more  capability  to  process  lower-grade  raw  materials.  In  addition,  ATC  will  realize\nenergy cost savings of 12 percent per ton.\n\n3.\nCNM  will  realize  improved  efficiency  from  the  subproject  because  the  installed\nequipment will allow it to process lower-grade local ore and reduce its dependence on imported\nore.  Other  process  improvements  will  allow  the  company  to  realize  2  percent  savings  in  the\namount of raw material required and an 8 percent reduction in energy costs.\n\nWHC  will  benefit  from  increased  capability  to  utilize  lower-grade  raw  materials.  The\n\n4.\nsubproject will also generate energy savings, reducing the energy cost per ton by 54 percent.\n\n5.\nWZM will close down its steel making production line. WZM has used an average selling\nprice of Y3,400 per ton for ductile pipe. Current prices are Y4,800 and are expected to increase\ndue  to  strong  demand.  The  price  projection  for  pig  iron  is  Y1,000  per  ton  compared  with  the\ncurrent price of Y1,150. In recent years, the price of pig iron has ranged from Y900 per ton to\nY1,000  per  ton.  The  project  will  benefit  WZM  as  the  company  will  replace  an  aging  highly\npolluting rolling mill with ductile pipe equipment. Ductile pipe has higher margins and a stronger\ndemand outlook.\n\n6.\nSelling prices for WSC\u2019s primary products have been depressed in recent years. In 2001\nthey have all experienced increases and forecasts are for moderate increases due to demand\nstrength in the PRC. The subproject will benefit in terms of the financial performance of WSC by\nallowing  its  full  capacity  utilization  because  it  will  produce  higher  quality  I-membrane  caustic\nsoda,  improve  its  recovery  of  liquid  chlorine,  and  produce  more  due  to  fewer  pollution\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nconstraints. In addition, WCS will  realize energy savings of 33 percent for those products and\ngenerate excess steam to sell for heat to nearby consumers.\n\nC.\n\nEnvironmental Improvement Subprojects\n\n7.\nHuangshan Water Company (HWC) will generate incremental revenues from the project\nthrough increased capacity for water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste disposal while\nHuangshan  Electric  Company  (HEC)  will  generate  incremental  revenues  from  the  project\nthrough  increased  electricity  sales.  All  tariffs  will  be  increased  at  3  percent  per  annum  until\n2010. The Project will provide infrastructure that is necessary for the scenic area to continue to\ngrow  and  manage  more  visitors.  Jiuhua  Tourism  Group  Company  (JTC)  will  generate\nincremental revenues from the project through water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste\ndisposal tariffs. The revenues will be increased at 6 percent per year until 2010.\n\nD.\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe  FIRRs  for  the  six  CP  subprojects  and  the  three  environmental  improvement  and\n8.\nacid  rain  damage  rehabilitation  (EI-ARD)  subprojects  are  given  in  Tables  A13.1-A13.9.\nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  subprojects  can

Economic\nreturns are calculated over a 20-year period corresponding to the economic life of the subproject\ninvestments.  For  the  major  traded  inputs  and  outputs,  the  economic  resource  flows  were\nestimated in border prices using the domestic currency as numeraire. Traded goods valued at the\nborder  price  level  were  revalued  to  the  domestic  price  level  through  the  shadow  exchange  rate\nfactor (SERF) of 1.11 equal to the inverse of the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 that has\nbeen  used  in  other  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  projects  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\n(PRC).  For  nontraded  items,  the  resource  flows  were  estimated  from  financial  prices  using\nconversion factors and shadow prices. The economic analysis was conducted in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Costs\n\n2.\nData  for  capital  costs  was  taken  from  the  financial  analysis  adjusted  using  relevant\nconversion factors, expressed in constant prices. In calculating economic capital costs, all duties,\nsubsidies,  taxes,  and  resource  transfers  were  excluded.  Only  real  resource  claims  were\nconsidered in calculating incremental working capital. The price of electricity was set equal to an\nupdated  estimate  of  the  long-run  marginal  cost  of  production,  generation,  and  distribution  of\nelectricity in the PRC.1  The economic price of water was calculated by adapting a local survey\nmeasure of willingness to pay (WTP) for each cubic meter (m3) of water.  The economic price of\nwater was equated with an income-adjusted updated household WTP value (Y/m3) for the control\nand cleanup of wastewater discharges in Hefei (capital of Anhui). The nontraded labor inputs are\nadjusted by the SCFs of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 for skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled labor, respectively.\nA  weighted  (by  number  of  staff)  average  conversion  factor  was  applied  to  the  wage  and  salary\nlevels in the financial model. This labor conversion factor averaged between 0.80 and 0.82. Major\nraw material inputs were adjusted by conversion factors reflecting border price equivalent values\nand shadow prices.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nThe  incremental  economic  benefits  from  the  six  cleaner  production  (CP)  subproject\n3.\ninvestments  are  derived  from  the  increased  value  of  output  (reflecting  increased  value  of\nconsumption  to  society),  foreign  exchange  savings,  production  efficiencies  involving  energy\nconservation, and the use of solid waste by-products as raw material inputs.  A key efficiency and\nenvironmental improvement feature of most of the subprojects is mining the waste stream (solid\nand liquid) for valuable raw material inputs.  This waste stream utilization results in value-added\neconomic  activity.  Because  the  main  plant  outputs  from  the  subproject  investments  are\nincremental,  the  shadow  price  applied  was  based  on  the  financial  market  price  inclusive  of  the\ndomestic consumption tax less subsidies to the buyer. Electrolytic copper is an output in several\nof the subproject investments. Since refined copper consumption exceeds production in the PRC,\nthe  economic  price  for  electrolytic  copper  was  calculated  as  the  border  price  equivalent  value\nadjusted  by  the  SERF.2  Several  of  the  subproject  investments  are  expected  to  result  in  energy\nsavings that are equivalent to a given amount of tons per year of standard coal equivalent.  These\nsavings  were  monetized  by  applying  the  economic  value  of  coal  to  the  annual  standard  coal\nequivalent  volumes  (in  tons)  expected  to  be  saved.    The  economic  price  of  coal  was  a  border\nprice  equivalent  value.    Economic  prices  for  the  solid  waste  by-product  materials  were\ndetermined from local market prices adjusted by conversion factor reflecting their shadow prices.\n\n                                                          \n1 World Bank, 1997. Clear Water Blue Skies: China\u2019s Environment in the New Century (p. 52) and updated by applying\n\ncost escalation factor derived from the urban consumer price index in the country economic review.\n\n2 World Bank, April 2000. Global Commodity Markets, page 69.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nC.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis\n\n4.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 20.4 percent (Table\nA14.1).  The  EIRRs  for  the  CP  subproject  investments  range  from  14.2  to  27.5  percent  (Table\n14.2-14.7).  The  EIRRs  for  the  three  environmental  improvement  and  acid  rain  damage\nrehabilitation subprojects range from 19.7 to 23.9 percent (Table 14.8-14.10). These values are\ngreater  than  the  12  percent  discount  rate,  which  represents  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of\ncapital.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  subprojects  continue  to  be  viable  under  the  most\nplausible  of  risk-related  scenarios.  Subproject  EIRRs  are  most  sensitive  or  responsive  to\nreductions  in  benefits  as  opposed  to  increases  in  costs  or  project  implementation  delays.  The\nanalysis  also  suggests  that  the  economic  feasibility  of  the  project  can  withstand  a  number  of\nadverse risk conditions.\n\nTable A14.1: Economic Analysis (Y\u2019000)\n\nYear\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\nCapital\nCosts\n(281,023)\n(610,085)\n(759,509)\n(435,956)\n(16,807)\n(16,807)\n(14,307)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n(11,807)\n203,430\n\nO&M\nCosts\n(3,318)\n(5,979)\n(5,707)\n(163,745)\n(703,809)\n(10,14,241)\n(1,199,412)\n(1,175,636)\n(1,176,638)\n(1,177,729)\n(1,178,717)\n(1,179,784)\n(1,180,936)\n(1,182,181)\n(1,183,525)\n(1,184,976)\n(1,186,544)\n(1,188,237)\n(1,190,066)\n(1,192,040)\n(914,569)\n\nOther Incremental\nSocial Costs\n(19,860)\n(20,058)\n(30,757)\n(31,061)\n(31,366)\n(31,671)\n(31,978)\n(32,286)\n(32,595)\n(32,933)\n(34,130)\n(35,381)\n(36,691)\n(38,062)\n(39,496)\n(40,998)\n(42,570)\n(44,215)\n(45,939)\n(47,743)\n(49,633)\n\nEconomic\nBenefits\n(236,261)\n(338,810)\n(471,780)\n(157,662)\n815,393\n1,500,786\n1,924,180\n2,121,105\n2,387,476\n2,568,953\n2,837,514\n3,009,565\n3,071,811\n3,131,568\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n3,188,934\n\n9,632,034\n\nNet Economic\nBenefits\n(540,462)\n(974,746)\n(1,267,753)\n(788,423)\n63,410\n438,066\n678,483\n901,345\n1,166,436\n1,346,483\n1,612,860\n1,782,593\n1,842,377\n1,899,518\n1,954,106\n1,951,153\n1,948,013\n1,944,674\n1,941,123\n1,937,343\n2,428,163\n\n2,714,953\n20.4%\n\nNPV@12\nEIRR\n\n(1,594,934)\n\n(4,961,626)\n\nD. \n\nRisk Analysis\n\nTo  complement  this  deterministic  analysis,  risk  analyses  was  undertaken  using  a\n5.\nprobabilistic  approach  to  the  perceived  risk  factors  that  affect  project  viability.  Four  broad\ncategories of risk were considered: (i) benefit reduction, (ii) capital cost increase, (iii) operational\nand  maintenance  cost  increase,  and  (iv)  commencement  delay.  Risk  analysis  was  carried  out\nusing  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  technique.  Results  from  3,000  simulations  show  that  the\nexpected EIRR for the Project, based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations is\n19.9 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.1 percent), about 2 percent lower than the base case\nEIRR (without considering project risks). The probability for the EIRR to fall below the considered\ndiscount rate of 12 percent is almost zero.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nTable A14.2: ATC Economic Analysis (Y'000)\n\nTable A14.3: CNM
