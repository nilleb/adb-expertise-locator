A summary initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  the \nBoard on 4 February 2004. \n\nThe proposed Roads for Rural Development Project (Project) will \naddress  accessibility  to  poor,  rural  districts  in  the  Lao  PDR \nthrough improvement of the transport network. The Project will (i) \nrehabilitate about 292 kilometers (km) of selected roads to remote \nrural  regions,  (ii)  provide  supplementary \nfor  road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  execute  a  project  for  improvement  of  road \nsafety, and (iv) provide a study of tariffs and policies for transport \nservices to promote increased efficiency in road transportation.  \n\nfunding \n\nThe  areas  served  by  the  rural  roads  proposed  for  upgrading  are \namong  the  poorest  in  the  Lao  PDR  in  terms  of  access  to  health \ncare,  education,  and  other  services.  Each  road  selected  will \nimprove  access  to  one  of  the  priority  47  poorest  districts  in  the \ncountry.  Most  of  the  local  populations  in  the  project  area  have \nhigh levels of disease, malnutrition, and illiteracy. Few areas have \naccess  to  safe  water,  sanitation,  and  electricity.  The  Project  will \nrelieve the isolation of these areas by reducing cost and time for \ntravel,  and  eliminating  the  disruption  of  traffic  during  the  wet \nseason.  That  will  enable  continuous \ntrade  and  economic \nexchange, and nondisrupted access to schools, medical facilities, \nand  other  social  and  civil  services.  The  Project  components  are \nconsistent with  the  priorities  agreed  to  in  the  Government  of  Lao \nPDR\u2019s  National  Poverty  Eradication  Program, \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Medium-Term  Transport  Strategy  for \nthe  Lao  PDR,  and  the  draft  Northern  Region  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Strategy  currently  under  preparation  through  an \nADB technical assistance (TA). \n\nThe  overall  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  the  rural  poor \nbetter  access  to  markets,  employment,  and  social  facilities  and \nthus, to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. \n\nObjective\n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe cost is estimated at $39.2 million \n\n\fiv\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation\nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nADB will provide a loan of $17.7 million equivalent from its special \nAsian Development Funds (ADF) resources. The Government will \nfinance  part  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  about  $8.2  million \nequivalent.  The  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  will \ncofinance $6.0 million to finance the Pakxane - Thasi road portion \nof the civil works construction. The Nordic Development Fund will \nprovide  $7.3  million  of  cofinancing  to  finance  part  of  the  cost  of \nconsulting  services  under  the  Project  (Package  1:  Construction \nSupervision, Project Preparation Services and Social Action Plan;\nand Package 3: Road Safety Program).\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR12,148,000 ($17.7 million equivalent) will be made  \nfrom ADF resources. The ADF loan will be denominated in special \ndrawing  rights,  and  will have  a  32-year  term,  including  an 8-year \ngrace period, with an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod, then 1.5% afterward.   \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\n7.5 years \n\n31 December 2011 \n\nMinistry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction \n(MCTPC)\n\nThe  project  will  be  implemented  by  the  Department  of  Roads \n(DOR)  under  MCTPC.  DOR  has  extensive  experience \nin \nimplementing  projects  funded  by  external  agencies.  The  Project \nwill be managed by a project management unit headed by a full-\ntime  manager  who  is  accountable  to  the  DOR  director  general. \nThe  project  manager  will  be  directly  responsible  for  project \nsupervision.  \n\nProcurement of all civil works in the contract will be in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Bidding  will  be  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and  the  contractor \nwill be selected from prequalified bidders. Contracts for civil works \nvalued  at  less  than  $1  million,  and  all  periodic  maintenance \ncontracts,  will  be  procured  by \nlocal  competitive  bidding \nprocedures using the Government\u2019s standard bidding documents, \nwhich  ADB  has  reviewed  and  accepted  for  other  projects. \nAdvanced action for procurement of civil works was approved on \n27 October 2003. \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries\n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nv\n\nAbout  188  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about \n1,589  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  required  to \nassist  in  (i)  construction  supervision,  including  implementation  of \nthe  community  safeguards,  resettlement,  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plans,  and  the  environment  management  program; \n(ii)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii)  project \npreparation  services,  including  preparation  of  feasibility  studies, \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plans, and detailed \nimpact \nengineering  designs;  (iv)  social  and  environmental \nadministration;  (v)  developing  and  implementing  a  road  safety \nprogram;  (vi)  implementation  of  a  social  action  plan  for  local \nresource  management,  nonformal  education, \nroad  safety \nawareness, and prevention programs for HIV/AIDS1 and sexually \ntransmitted  diseases;  and \nfor \nenvironmental/social staff. \n\n(vii)  graduate  education \n\nProject benefits are directly related to traffic. Such benefits include \n(i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  savings  in  freight  and \npassenger  time,  and  (iii)  benefits  from  traffic  generated  by \nreduced  costs,  and  improved  accessibility,  of  transport.  An \nestimate  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  prepared,  based \non  assessment  of  the  direct  benefits  and  costs.  The  Project's \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  17.1%. \nIndirect benefits were not included in the quantitative assessment \nof  benefits,  so  the  EIRR  can  be  regarded  as  a  conservative \nestimate of economic and development impacts. \n\nNet  economic  benefits  have  been  distributed  among  key \nstakeholders,  including  poor  and  non-poor  end  users.  The  poor \nare  estimated  to  comprise  60%  of  the  project  beneficiaries.  The \nPoverty Impact Ratio is estimated at 0.82.\n\nThe main risks associated with the Project during construction are \n(i)  delayed  or  inadequate  execution  of  mitigating  measures, \nespecially resettlement; (ii) suboptimal performance of contractors \nand supervision; (iii) delays in procurement and local counterpart \nfunding;  and  (iv)  environmental  degradation  due  to  insufficient \ncleanup and mitigation by contractors. After construction, the main \nrisks  associated  with  the  Project  are:  (i)  lower  traffic  levels  than \nexpected;  (ii)  inadequate  passing  of  savings  in  vehicle  operation \ncosts  to  users  of  public  transport;  (iii)  increased  traffic  accidents \nand  fatalities;  and  (iv)  insufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance. \nOther  concerns  are  risks  of  increased  illegal  logging,  increased \nendangerment  of  wildlife \nillegal \nthrough \ntrafficking  of  women  and  children,  and  increased  land  grabbing. \nThe  interventions  and  mitigating  measures  that  form  part  of  the \nProject should adequately alleviate these concerns.  \n\nillegal  gathering, \n\n                                                \n1 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\fvii\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  (i)  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (the  Lao  PDR)  for  the  Roads  for  Rural \nDevelopment  Project;  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) of a loan to be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) \nfor the Project. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nThe landlocked Lao PDR is poor, mountainous, and sparsely populated. Most of the poor \nlive in rural areas with limited access. Road access is a key condition that underlies the potential \nfor poverty reduction in the Lao PDR, both in terms of ability and cost effectiveness of targeting \nservices  to  the  poor,  as  well  as  the  benefits  in  poverty  reduction  that  result  from  economic \ngrowth.  Improved  road  access  will  remove  cost  barriers  in  the  provision  of  social  services  and \nenhance the ability of the poor to benefit from overall economic growth. Thus, poverty reduction \nthrough  improved  accessibility  can  be  both  direct  and  indirect,  with  multisectoral  implications, \nespecially in education and health. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analyses \n\n3.\nThe  Road  Network.  Transport  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  almost  exclusively  by  road.  Roads \ncarry  about  70%  of  freight  and  90%  of  passenger  traffic,  and  are  a  key  element  of  the  basic \ninfrastructure  supporting  national  and  international  trade.  Density  of  the  road  network  is  low: \nabout 0.14 km/sq km. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is improving, \nbut 4 of the 18 provincial capitals remain without all-weather links. Only 14% of the road network \nis paved, including about half of the national road system. The other roads have gravel or earth \nsurfaces. Much of the local network is impassable during the wet season. Traffic is generally low \non national and provincial roads throughout the Lao PDR. The road network is a major asset for \nany  country.  Ensuring  that  the  value  of  roads  is  not  lost  requires  timely  and  effective \nmaintenance,  based  on  a  strategy  that  targets  the  road  network  as  a  whole.  That  strategy  is \nbased  on  information  on  the  condition  of  individual  roads.  To  meet  this  objective,  the \nGovernment  established  a  Road  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF)  in  2001  to  provide  sustainable, \ndomestic funding for maintenance of the national road network, and eventually, all Lao roads. An \nanalysis of the road subsector is given in Appendix 1. \n\nTransport  Services.  Transport  services,  for  both  freight  and  passengers,  are  available \n4.\nover the entire road network, although quality and frequency reflect the quality and remoteness \nof access roads. The extent to which benefits of road improvement are transferred to end-users \nis determined by the availability and competition of transport services. Private operators provide \nmost  transport  services,  which  are  mainly  regulated  by  the  provincial  transport  associations. \nThese  associations  act  as  regulatory  bodies  for  outreach,  routing,  and  frequency  of  services. \nThe  transport  associations,  although  private  in  principle,  report  to  provincial  departments  of \ncommunication, transport, post, and construction (DCTPC). The provincial governor is the tariff \nregulator and approves tariffs along the routes yearly, based on diesel costs, road quality, and \nother  costs  of  vehicle  maintenance.  Findings  suggest  that  the  initial  benefits  to  end  users  of \nimproved road access is significant where accessibility has been severely restricted; benefits of \ntransport availability increase with all-weather accessibility. But the transfer of vehicle costs and \ntime  savings  from  providers  to  end  consumers  is  less  obvious  for  improved  road  sections  that \nwere  previously  accessible  but  are now  improved.  The  extent  to  which  regulations  in  transport \nservices reduce net benefits to end users of services in the Lao PDR is not clear. \n\n\f2\n\n5.\nRoad  Safety.  Road  accident  fatalities  in  the  Lao  PDR  rose  245%  from  1991  to  1999. \nRoad  accidents  increased  176%.  Road  fatalities  are  the  highest  among  Southeast  Asian \ncountries: almost 20 persons per 10,000 vehicles. The potential for even greater accident rates \nis  high,  considering  the  increase  in  vehicles,  the  growing  population,  and  increased  vehicle \nspeeds  from  improvements  to  the  road  network.  A  national  road  safety  strategy  has  been \nprepared, but implementation has not started.    \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6.\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy. The Government has given high priority to improvement of \nthe road transport system, mainly to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus \nto deficit areas, (ii) flow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing \nand export of cash crops and other produce, and (iv) participation in regional and international \ntrade. The targets for physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the national road \nnetwork,  (ii)  improving  the  provincial  road  network,  (iii)  upgrading  transit  routes,  and  (iv) \nestablishing a sustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \nAll-weather  access  is  being  provided  to  16  of  the  Government's  list  of  the  46  poorest  districts \nunder  current  or  committed  ADB  projects,  including  Loan  1533-LAO(SF):  Xieng  Khuang  Road \nImprovement,  and  Loan  1795-LAO(SF):  Rural  Access  Roads.  MCTPC  is  addressing  the \nimprovement of access to the districts that lack year-round road access, and provision of road \naccess to areas that that lack it entirely, under an ongoing plan as part of the National Poverty \nEradication Program (NPEP). \n\nADB Strategy. The ADB strategy for the road subsector in the Lao PDR1 proposes that \n7.\nADB\u2019s  main  development  focus  for  the  medium  term  be  to  induce  rural  development  through \nincreasing  access  of  rural  areas  to  markets.  Priority  is  to  be  on  providing  access  to  provinces \nwith poor connections to the main network, and to completing \u201cmissing links\u201d in the road network. \nThese  priorities  are  consistent  with  those  proposed  in  the  Government  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  NPEP, \nprepared  in  2003,  and  the  draft  Northern  Region  Infrastructure  Development  Strategy  being \nprepared under an ADB technical assistance (TA).2 The Lao PDR faces a number of transport-\nrelated challenges that can be broadly subdivided into four major groups: (i) the need to develop \nreliable  road  access  throughout  the  country,  to  promote  economic  development,  poverty \nreduction,  and  cohesion;  (ii)  the  need  to  improve  road  management,  especially  road \nmaintenance and its funding, to secure existing and future road assets; (iii) the need to reduce \nthe  high  and  growing  rates  of  road  accidents,  with  their  rapidly  growing  economic  and  social \ncosts; and (iv) the provision of efficient transport services. \n\n8.\nExternal  Assistance  to  the  Road  Subsector.  ADB  has  been  a  major  contributor  to \ndevelopment  of  the  road  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  by  providing  11  loans  amounting  to  $319.0 \nmillion and 30 TA grants totaling $13.8 million. ADB\u2019s assistance to the sector represents 36% of \nthe $727.0 million of assistance by multilateral and bilateral organizations. Most of the external \nfinancing  has  been  directed  to  national  and  provincial  roads,  as  well  as  to  bridges  over  the \nMekong River (Appendix 2).\n\n9.\nLessons  Learned.  The  Project  includes  components  that  address  issues  of  transport \nservices  and  land  tenure.  These  two  issues  were  highlighted  during  an  Operations  Evaluation \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2001.

The transport services study will address means by which benefits are passed on to \nroad  users,  particularly  the  poor.  Measures  to  address  land  tenure  have  been  included  to \nsupport the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction. \n\n10. \nEarlier projects were affected by delays in consultant recruitment, in field surveys, and in \ndetailed  engineering  design.  These  start-up  delays  were  largely  overcome  in  later  projects \nthrough  advance  action  and  inclusion  of  detailed  engineering  design  components  in  the \npreceding  projects.  Experience  gained  from  the  bidding  processes  in  earlier  projects  has \nprovided  a  better  understanding  of  unit  rates  for  materials,  human  resource  needs  and \ncapabilities, and equipment productivity for road construction and maintenance in the Lao PDR. \nADB  has  assisted  in  improvement  of  standardization  of  documentation  and  procurement \nprocesses.4 Failure to submit audited financial statements on a timely basis has been a problem \nin the past. This is being addressed through an action plan, and development of technical skills \nin  the  National  Audit  Office,  both  financed  by  ADB.  The  experience  and  capacity  of  the  Lao \nconstruction industry has steadily increased. In 2002 a joint venture consisting of only Lao firms \nwas  awarded  one  of  four  civil  works  contracts  bid  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  under  Loan  1795-LAO(SF).  Another  Lao  firm  was  a  partner,  winning  a  second \ncontract, in the joint venture. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  induce  economic  development  and  social  integration,  and \n11. \nthereby to reduce poverty, through the connection of all district and provincial centers in the Lao \nPDR, both to each other and to the Lao national economy. This network of all-weather roads is \nto be well maintained and is to support efficient transport services. The purpose of the Project is \nto increase access to adequate, reliable, affordable, and safe all-year road transport in remote \nrural  regions.  This  goal  is  consistent  with  priorities  set  out  in  NPEP,  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term \nTransport  Strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  (footnote  1),  and  the  draft  Northern  Region  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Strategy, currently being prepared under an ADB TA (footnote 2). \n\n12. \nEconomic  growth  has  had  significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction  in  the  Lao  PDR.  But \nmost  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas,5  so  poverty  reduction  requires  that  investments  be \ngeographically  focused  to  poor  areas  with  the  potential  for  trade  and  economic  growth.  A  key \ndeterminant  of  rural  poverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  rice  insufficiency.6  A  lack  of  sufficient  rice  is \nlargely caused by reliance on subsistence agriculture, external shocks, and a lack of access to \nmarkets. \n\nThe development objective of the Project is to reduce poverty and facilitate economic and \n13. \nsocial development by increasing access to adequate, reliable, affordable, and safe all-year road \ntransport  in  remote  rural  regions  where  accessibility  is  poor.  In  this  respect,  the  Project  will  (i) \nrehabilitate  selected  roads  to  remote  rural  regions,  (ii)  provide  funding  for  supplementary  road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  execute  a  road  safety  improvement  project;  and  (iv)  initiate  a  transport \n\n                                                \n3   ADB. 2002.

All \nproposed  roads  either  pass  through  or  connect  to  one  of  the  47  poorest  districts  identified  in \nNPEP  where  connections  to  these  districts  were  given  priority.  Roads  for  the  Project  were \nidentified  through  an  initial  screening  based  on  provincial  priorities,  poverty  indicators,  and \nlinkages  to  the  national  road  network.  This  initial  screening  was  further  refined  using  a  multi-\ncriteria analysis that took into account traffic; impact on poverty; agricultural potential; linkages to \nthe national network, external trade, and other development projects; social and environmental \nsensitivity;  and  gender  issues.  The  final  selection  was  confirmed  during  project  preparation. \nImprovement of the five roads selected for this component will be implemented in three phases. \nIn the first phase, the Xaisetha-Sanxai road, in Attapeu Province, and the Pakxane-Thasi road, \nin Borikhamxay Province, will be upgraded. Detailed design and implementation documentation \nwill be prepared for the Pakton-Ban Vang road in Vientiane Province, and the Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroad  in  Sayabury  Province.  Implementation  documentation  will  include resettlement  and  ethnic \nminorities plans, as appropriate, and bidding documents. In the second phase, the Pakton-Ban \nVang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads will be upgraded. Work during project preparation showed that \nupgrading  of  the  Sayabury-Hongsa  road  in  Sayabury  Province  was  viable,  but  at  the  time  of \nproject  appraisal  insufficient  funds  were  available  to  be  applied  to  the  upgrading  of  the  entire \nroad. Therefore, it is proposed that once civil works contracts for the above two second phase \nroads have been awarded, the remaining project funds be applied to the Sayabury-Hongsa road. \nAn economically viable extent of work, based on available funds, will be determined. This will be \nthe  basis  for  preparing  detailed  designs  and  implementation  documentation,  as  for  the  phase-\ntwo  roads.  In  the  third  phase,  the  Sayabury-Hongsa  road  will  be  upgraded.  Appendix  4  gives \ndetailed descriptions of the civil works for each road. The Xaisetha-Sanxai road will pass through \nan  area  contaminated  with  unexploded  ordinance  (UXO).  The  Project  includes  UXO  clearance \nalong the road as part of the civil works. \n\n15. \nThe  rural  development  roads  component  also  includes  the  establishment  of  forest \nproduct  control  and  vehicle  weigh  stations  at  locations  to  be  determined  during  project \nimplementation.  The  type  of  equipment  to  be  procured  and  the  locations  of  the  vehicle  weigh \nstations  will  be  consistent  with  work  being  done  through  the  Heavy  Transport  Management \nProgram (HTMP), funded by the World Bank. Where appropriate, the establishment of a single \nfacility to handle both control of forest products and vehicle weights will be considered. \n\n16. \nThe rural development roads component includes measures for environmental mitigation \nand  a  monitoring  program,  both  during  and  after  construction,  as  agreed  in  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  and  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE). \nMitigation and monitoring costs are included in the cost estimate for civil works and consulting \nservices. The civil works contract documents include provisions for penalties if a contractor fails \nto comply with specified measures for environmental mitigation. A copy of the SIEE is available \non request (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n\n\f5\n\n2. \n\nPeriodic Maintenance  \n\n17. \nThe  Project  will  include  funding  for  the  RMF  to  help  address  funding  deficits  until \ndomestic funds can meet the requirements of a sustainable network. Financial projections for the \nRMF  are  shown  in  Appendix  5.  The  financing  will  be  applied  to  periodic  maintenance  of \nsubprojects  identified  by  the  RMF\u2019s  road  maintenance  management  system.  ADB  will  approve \ncontracts based on evaluations prepared using standard RMF procedures that were accepted on \nprevious projects.\n\n3. \n\nProject Preparation Services \n\n18. \nProject  Preparation  Services  will  include  consulting  services  for  (i)  preparation  and \ndetailed  implementation  documentation  for  the  Paxton-Ban  Vang  and  Hongsa-Thaxoan  roads; \n(ii) revisions to documentation for the Sayabury-Hongsa road, as necessary to take account of \navailable funding; (iii) preparing detailed implementation documentation for future subprojects for \ntransport  network  improvement  projects;  and  (iv)  a  tariff  study  to  determine  the  viability  and \naffordability of transport services. \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety Program \n\nThe  Project  will  include  consulting  services  to  help  the  Lao  PDR  establish  a  viable \n19. \ncapacity  to  address  road  safety  issues.  These  funds  will  be  used  to  (i)  start  implementation  of \nthe  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  through  the  detailed  action  plan  prepared  under  ADB\u2019s \nAssociation of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) Road Safety TA,7 (ii) help the Government establish \na  national  road  safety  council  to  coordinate  all  road  safety  issues;  (iii)  develop  mechanisms  to \nadminister road safety activities, including sustainable funding and partnerships with the private \nsector;  (iv)  disseminate  educational  and  advisory  materials  on  road  safety,  especially  to  the \nprovinces;8 (v) establish a road accident database that all road safety agencies can access; (vi) \nestablish  demonstration  projects  on  identification,  analysis  and  elimination  or  alleviation  of \naccident blackspots; (vii) develop capabilities in emergency services and incident response; (viii) \nprovide  enforcement  equipment;  (ix)  provision  of  driver  training  and  vehicle  inspection;  and  (x) \nidentify road safety issues that impact specifically on the poor. \n\n5. \n\nTransport Services \n\n20. \nA  diagnostic  study  is  needed  to  clarify  effects  of  the  existing  regulatory  framework  on \ndelivery of transport services. This study may then be used to develop interventions to address \nspecific  issues.  These  needs  are  being  addressed  through  (i)  a  proposal  to  the  Public-Private \nInfrastructure  Advisory  Facility  to  fund  a  diagnostic  study  to  help  the  Government  assess \nregulations and the institutional framework, and determine implications for service delivery and \ntariffs; and (ii) including in the project consulting services on transport sector tariff and regulatory \nissues to help implement recommendations of the diagnostic study. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe  resettlement  component  will  finance  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  for  all \nfull \n\nthe  rural  development  roads  component.  During  project  preparation, \n\n21. \nroads  under \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2002. Road Safety in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Manila. \n8   This will build on work being undertaken by Handicap International in Vientiane. \n\n\f6\n\nresettlement  plans  for  the  Pakxane-Ban  Thasi  (Borikhamxay  Province),  Xaisetha-Sanxai \n(Attapeu Province), and Sayabury-Hongsa (Sayabury Province) roads were prepared to comply \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A \nGuide to Good Practice. A resettlement framework was also prepared for the remaining project \nroads.  Under  phase  1  of  the  Project  (i)  resettlement  plans  for  the  Pakxane-Ban  Thasi  and \nXaisetha-Sanxai roads will be implemented; (ii) a full resettlement plan will be prepared for the \nPakton-Ban  Vang  road;  and  (iii)  a  short  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  the  Hongsa-\nThaxoan  road,  as  work  will  be  limited,  other  than  replacement  of  a  temporary  bridge. \nResettlement plans for the Pakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads will be (i) based on the \nresettlement  framework  and  detailed  designs  to  be  prepared  under  this  phase,  (ii)  prepared  to \ncomply  with  ADB  policy,  and  (iii)  submitted  for  ADB  approval  before  implementation.  Under \nphase  two of  the  Project  (i)  resettlement  plans  for  the  Pakton-Ban  Vang  and  Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroads will be implemented; and (ii) the resettlement plan for the Sayabury-Hongsa road will be \nupdated, if necessary, to be consistent with any changes required to the scope of work for this \nroad. The resettlement plan for the Sayabury-Hongsa road will be implemented in phase three.  \n\nBased on the three resettlement plans prepared during project preparation, work on the \n22. \nPakxane-Ban Thasi, Xaisetha-Sanxai, and Sayabury-Hongsa roads will require land acquisition \nof 4.08 hectares (ha), comprising 2.32 ha of rice paddy land and 1.76 ha of homestead land, and \nwill affect 328 households. The Project will affect 117 houses, 2 village offices, 37 small shops, \nand 45 rice bins. All of these will be relocated within the same villages. Also, 76 trees must be \ncleared from construction corridors. Resettlement has been planned in accordance with the draft \nNational Policy and Decree on Resettlement and Compensation, implementing regulations, and \ntechnical guidelines.9\n\n23. \nA  high  proportion  of  ethnic  minority  groups  live  along  the  Sayabury-Hongsa  and \nXaisetha-Sanxai roads, so special attention was given to identifying and addressing their special \nneeds.  The  resettlement  plans  for  these  two  roads  each  include  community  development  plan \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  plans  are  called \ncommunity  development  plans  because  ethnic  minority  households  are  often  integrated  with \nnon-minority populations. The Resettlement Plan for Pakxane-Thasi includes a special action to \nhelp villages in non-timber forest product management. This special action will be implemented \nas  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  Social  Action  Plan  (para.  27.)  Special  attention  has  been  given  to \nidentifying  and  addressing  the  needs  of  all  disadvantaged  groups,  including  the  landless,  the \npoor, \nthe \nresettlement  and  community  development  plans  and  framework.  The  full  resettlement  and \ncommunity  development  plans,  and  the  resettlement  framework,  are  available  on  request \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \n\nthe  disabled.  Appendix  6  summarizes \n\nfemale-headed  households,  and \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nSocial Action Plan \n\n24. \nThe  Project  will  have  social  impacts.  Thus,  it  will  include  a  Social  Action  Plan  to \nimplement social safeguard requirements of the Lao PDR and ADB. This component comprises \ncommunity  development  plans  for  ethnic  minorities  on  two  roads  and  a  resource  management \nplan for non-timber forest products for one road. For all roads there will be a program to secure \nland  tenure,  a  community  road  safety  awareness  program,  and  programs  for  awareness  and \n\n                                                \n9    Prepared  under  ADB  Loan  1867-LAO  (SF),  Environment  and  Social  Program,  approved  October  2001  for  $20 \nmillion. The cabinet approved the Decree on Resettlement and Compensation on 25 December 2003. The Prime \nMinister\u2019s office has approved the Decree in principle, and plans to issue it in July 2004. Thereafter, the Science, \nTechnology, and Environment Agency will issue implementing regulations and technical guidelines and MCTPC will \nissue a notification of adoption of these regulations and guidelines. \n\n\f7\n\nprevention of HIV/AIDs10 and human trafficking. Measures for inclusion in the Social Action Plan \nhave  been  developed  as  stand-alone  initiatives,  but  take  into  account  other  activities  in  the \nproject  area.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  includes  a  copy  of  the  Social  Action  Plan. \nSupplementary Appendix B includes the community development plans. \n\n25. \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) determined that road improvements \nwill  make  the  mainly  ethnic  minority  communities  along  the  Xaisetha-Sanxai  and  Sayabury-\nHongsa roads vulnerable because of their low numbers and low literacy rates. Thus, the Project \nincludes ethnic minority development plans as required by ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\nThe ethnic minority plans are called community development plans because the ethnic minority \nfamilies are integrated with the non-minority population. Community development plans have been \nprepared  for  both  the  Xaisetha-Sanxai  and  Sayabury-Hongsa  roads,  where  two-thirds  of  the \npopulations are of various ethnic minorities. A policy framework has also been prepared to guide \npreparation  of  a  community  development  plan  for  the  Pakton-Ban  Vang  and  Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroads.  All  communities  along  all  project  roads  will  benefit  from  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms for HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and traffic safety. \n\na. \n\nNonformal Education: Ethnic Minority Development \n\n26. \nA  nonformal  educational  program  for  ethnic  minority  villages  along  the Xaisetha-Sanxai \nand  Sayabury-Hongsa  roads  will  be  financed.  Similar  components  will  be  included  for  the \nPakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads if similar needs are identified during the detailed \ndesign under phase 1. This project component will work with the provincial and district nonformal \neducation  departments  and  other  donors  to  support  basic  training  in  literacy,  numeracy  (the \ncapacity  for  quantative  thought  and  expression),  and  Lao  language  fluency.  The  program  will \ncover  both  adolescents\u2014with  special  emphasis  on  girls\u2014and  adults  who  have  had  no  formal \neducation.  The  objective  is  to  increase  development  and  enterprise  opportunities,  and \nconfidence.  The  program  will  include  (i)  training  of  nonformal  educators  who  will  reside  in  the \nvillages, then shift to a \u201cuser pays\u201d system for their services after 2 years; (ii) basic educational \nmaterials/equipment;  and  (iii)  training,  particularly  for  women,  in  literacy  and  numeracy, \nbusiness, savings and credit systems, bookkeeping, and other income-generating activities. \n\nb. \n\nLocal  Resource  Management:  Non-Timber  Forest  Product  Resource \nManagement Plan  \n\n27. \nThe  PPTA  determined  that  the  Ban  Kin  Yong  and  Ban  Thasi  communities  at  the  Thasi \nend of the Pakxane-Thasi road harvest non-timber forest products (NTFPs), and that outsiders \nalso harvest or buy NTFPs in the area. Road improvements will threaten the NTFP resources, so \nthe resettlement plan for the Pakxane-Thasi road includes a plan to enable the two communities \nto  sustainably  manage  those  resources.  This  component  will  help  the  provincial  and  district \nauthorities  design  and  implement  the  resource  management  plan.  The  Borikhan  District \nauthorities  have  acknowledged  the  need  for  such  a  program,  which  would  complement  similar \nwork  being  done  elsewhere  in  the  district  by  the  Lux  Development  and  Wildlife  Conservation \nSociety.\n\nc. \n\nLocal Resources Management: Securing Land Tenure \n\n28. \nThe  improved  roads  are  expected  to  increased  demand  for  land,  with  corresponding \neffects  on  land  prices,  in  the  project  impact  area.  The  poor  can  benefit  from  price  increases  if \n\n                                                \n10 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\f8\n\nland tenure is secure. But if land tenure is insecure, the poor will potentially be subject to land \ngrabbing for the potential value of the land and its resources. If land grabbing occurs, many of \nthe  development  impacts  may  not  accrue  to  the  poor,  especially  to  poor  farmers.  The \nDepartment  of  Lands  (DOL)  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  the  mandate  to  carry  out  the \ndesign and supervision of national programs of land registration and titling through offices of the \nprovincial services. But five years after the first phase of the Land Titling Project, only 100,000 \nland titles have been issued nationwide, out of a total of 1.6 million land parcels.11 Phase two will \nextend to urban areas in five other provinces.12 The Department of Forestry, under the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  is  responsible  for  implementing  land  use  planning  and  land \nallocation in rural areas. Temporary land use certificates have been issued to more than 330,000 \nhouseholds through the district agriculture and forestry offices and district administration offices. \nDOL is responsible for registration of these rights. Most people who live along project roads have \nland use rights certificates (Form 01) issued by district authorities. This is basically a declaration \nand  acknowledgement  of  occupancy  and  rights  to  use  the  land.  The  rights  can  be  sold  or \nbequeathed,  but  not  mortgaged.  The  responsibility  of  paying  taxes  comes  with  the  land  use \nrights certificates. At a minimum, the Project will facilitate provision of land use rights certificates \nto all households that do not yet have them, and who want to pay taxes and receive education \nand information on land rights. Also, MCTPC has formally requested the Government to expedite \nland titling along the project roads. \n\nd. \n\nCommunity Road Safety Awareness Program \n\n29. \nThe  community  road  safety  awareness  program  will  increase  awareness  about  traffic \nsafety,  improve  the  safety  of  children,  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  involving  pedestrians, \nchildren, animals, and drivers. The component will consist of (i) enforcement of safety standards \nduring  construction,  (ii)  installation  of  signs  warning  drivers  to  slow  down  in  settled  areas,  (iii) \nestablishment  and  enforcement  of  speed  limits,  (iv)  road  safety  education  for  children,  and  (v) \nconstruction  of  roadside  fences  to  prevent  livestock  and  small  children  from  stepping  onto  the \nroadways.\n\ne. \n\nAwareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  Sexually  Transmitted \nDiseases, and Drug Use \n\n30. \nThe  program  for  awareness  and  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted  diseases \n(STDs),  and  drug  use  will  be  designed  and  implemented  through  the  National  Committee  for \nControl of AIDS and the provincial committees for AIDS control. An international expert with local \nexperience  will  coordinate  the  program,  which  will  target  project  communities,  construction \nworkers, civil servants, and mobile populations. The program will include (i) a baseline survey on \nHIV/AIDS,  STDs,  and  village  populations;  (ii)  formation  of  village  monitoring  groups;  (iii) \npreventive  education  and  awareness  through  peer  education  and  training  of  trainers;  (iv) \nbehavior,  communication,  and  change  awareness,  including  preparation  of  information, \neducation, and communication materials; and (v) STD services/counseling and voluntary testing, \nand the promotion and distribution of condoms. \n\n                                                \n11  The Land Titling Project, approved February 1996 for $29 million and financed by the World Bank and the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID), was for land titling in urban areas of Vientiane Prefecture, and the \nprovinces  of  Champasack,  Luang  Prabang,  Savannakhet,  Vientiane.  The  project  will  be  expanded  to  other \nprovinces, including Borikhamxay. \n\n12  The Second Land Titling Project, approved by World Bank October 2003 for $14.82 million, was to provide 200,000 \nland  titles  in  urban,  peri-urban,  and  lowland  agricultural  areas  in  five  provinces,  and  to  continue  titling  and \nregistration in urban and peri-urban and lowland agricultural areas in provinces already covered. \n\n\f9\n\nf. \n\nTrafficking  of  Women  and  Children  Awareness  and  Prevention \nProgram\n\n31. \nThe  project  component  on  trafficking  of  women  and  children  will  finance  an  education \nprogram  to  raise  awareness  of  the  dangers  of  trafficking  and  to  promote  safe  migration \npractices. The program, which will target construction workers, women, community elders, and \ncommunity  youth,  will  be  designed  and  implemented  through  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social \nWelfare,  in  coordination  with  ongoing  and  planned  programs  of  ADB,13  the  Government, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  agencies  with  expertise  in  human  trafficking  in  the \nLao  PDR  such  as  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  International \nLabour  Organization.  The  program  will  include  (i)  identification  of  mobile  and  vulnerable \npopulations,  (ii)  increased  awareness  of  current  trafficking,  and  provision  of  safe  migration \ninformation  for  those  newly  arriving  to,  or  considering  leaving,  the  communities,  and  assuring \ntheir  incorporation  into  community  and  social  mobilization  activities;  (iii)  capacity  building  with \ngovernment  departments  involved  in  programs  to  deliver  social  protection  programs  about \ndangers of trafficking for this highly vulnerable target group; (iv) ensuring that contractors follow \nlabor  standards  during  construction;  and  (v)  ensuring  the  enforcement  of  requirements  in  civil \nworks  contracts  on  behavior  of  construction  workers  toward  commercial  sex  workers,  and \nreporting sexually abused children to local authorities. \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Social and Environmental Management  \n\n32.  MCTPC will adopt the national implementing regulations and technical guidelines for the \nnew  Decree  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  during  the  third  quarter  of  2004.  The  Decree \nwas prepared with ADB assistance under Loan 1867-LAO(SF) Environment and Social Program.\nThrough this loan, ADB supports the policy reform agenda of the Government of the Lao PDR \nfor  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards.  As  a  continuation  of  ongoing \nsupport under ADB TAs, it is proposed that the Project include funding (i) for consulting services \nto  provide  capacity  building  for  the  Social  and  Environmental  Division  of  the  Department  of \nRoads, (ii) to assist in implementation of the new regulations, and (iii) for graduate education for \ntwo staff of the Social and Environment Division. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n33. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $39.2 million equivalent, including physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest charges during construction (Table 1). The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $27.6 million, about 70% of total cost. The local currency cost is \nestimated at $11.6 million, about 30% of total cost.  Appendix 7 gives detailed cost estimates. \n\n                                                \n13  Proposed  regional  and  technical  assistance    (RETA)  on  Prevention  of  Trafficking  of  Girls  and  Women  and  Safe \nMigration for Women in the Greater Mekong Subregion, to be financed by Poverty Reduction Fund, 2004 pipeline, \nwith Loan 1989-LAO (ADB. 1989.

The  ADF  loan  will  be  denominated  in  special \ndrawing  rights,  and  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  an  8-year  grace  period,  with  a  1% \nyearly interest rate during the grace period and 1.5% afterward. The ADB loan will finance about \n58% of the foreign exchange costs, and about 14% of the local currency costs. The Government \nwill  finance  about  71%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  approximately  $8.2  million  equivalent,  and \nabout 21% of total costs from its own internal sources. The Lao PDR will be the Borrower. The \nBorrower will make the loan proceeds available to the Executing Agency (EA) through budgetary \nallocations. The OPEC Fund will cofinance $6.0 million of foreign exchange costs (about 22% of \nthe total) of civil works construction for the Pakxane-Thasi Road. The Nordic Development Fund \n(NDF) will provide $7.3 million14 to cofinance part of the cost of the consulting services under the \nProject  (Package  1:  Construction  Supervision,  Project  Preparation  Services  and  Social  Action \n\n                                                \n14 Financing from NDF will be on a tied basis. \n\n\f11\n\nPlan,  and  Package  3:  Road  Safety  Program).  NDF  will  finance  about  20%  of  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  and  about  16%  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  proportion  of  local  currency \ncosts to be financed under the ADB loan is justified by the nature of the Project and current fiscal \nconditions  in  the  Lao  PDR.  OPEC  Fund  financing  will  be  as  joint  cofinancing,  administered  by \nADB.  NDF  financing  will  be  made  available  as  parallel  financing.  Table  2  gives  the  Project \nfinancing plan. Appendix 7 gives financing details for each project component. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign\nExchange\n16.1\n\nLocal\nCurrency \n1.6\n\n6.0\n5.5\n0.0\n\n27.6\n\n0.0\n1.8\n8.2\n\n11.6\n\nTotal Cost  Percentage\n\n17.7\n\n6.0\n7.3\n8.2\n\n39.2\n\n45\n\n15\n19\n21\n\n100\n\nSource\n\nADB\nCofinancing \n\nOPEC Fund \nNDF\nGovernment \n\nTotal\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund = OPEC Fund for International Development, NDF = Nordic \nDevelopment Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n35.  MCTPC  will  be  the  EA  and  DOR,  the  Implementing  Agency.  DOR  has  extensive \nexperience  in  implementing  externally  funded  projects.  Management  will  be  by  a  project \nmanagement  unit  headed  by  a  project  manager.  At  appraisal,  MCTPC  confirmed  the  full-time \nappointment of the project manger, who will be directly responsible for project supervision and is \naccountable to the DOR director general. DCTPCs in each province where a project component \nwill  be  implemented  will  provide  counterparts  to  help  the  project  management  unit.  The  team \nleader  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  the  engineer\u2019s  representative  for  the \ncivil works, and will support the project management unit. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n36. \nThe Project will be implemented over about 7.5 years, including preconstruction activities \nthat  have  commenced  under  advance  procurement  action.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2011. Appendix 8 shows the indicative implementation schedule.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n37. \nProcurement of all civil works contracts will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Bidding will follow international competitive bidding procedures. The contractor will \nbe selected from prequalified bidders. Bidding for civil works contracts of $1 million or more will \nbe  by  prequalified  bidders,  and  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nContracts for civil works of less than $1 million, and all periodic maintenance contracts, will be \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures. The Government\u2019s standard bidding documents, if \nacceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  used.  ADB  has  reviewed  and  accepted  these  documents  for  other \n\n\f12\n\nprojects.  Appendix  9  lists  contract  packages  and  modes  of  procurement.  Advance  action  for \nprocurement of civil works has been approved. \n\n38. \nEquipment  for  vehicle  weigh  stations  will  be  procured  under  the  Project  through  direct \npurchase. These procedures are justified given (i) the low value of the contract, about $100,000; \nand (ii) the need for consistency with equipment bought under other contracts.  \n\n39. \nThe identification, administration, and supervision of periodic maintenance contracts will \nfollow RMF procedures that are acceptable to ADB. Local state-owned contractors that bid must \nbe legally and financially independent, and must operate under commercial laws. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n40. \nAbout 188 person-months of international consultants and about 1,589 person-months of \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  required  to  assist  in  (i) construction  supervision,  including \nimplementation of the community safeguards, development of plans for resettlement and ethnic \nminority  development,  and  the  environment  management  program;  (ii) project  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii)  project  preparation  services,  including  preparation  of  feasibility \nstudies,  plans  for  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development,  and  detailed  engineering \ndesigns; (iv) management of social and environmental impacts; (v) developing and implementing \na  road  safety  program;  (vi)  implementation  of  a  social  action  plan  for  local  resource \nmanagement,  nonformal  education,  road  safety  awareness,  and  developing  awareness  and \nprevention programs for HIV/AIDS, STDs, and human trafficking; and (vii) graduate education for \nenvironmental/social  staff.  Appendix  9  lists  contract  packages  and  modes  of  recruitment. \nAppendix  10  gives  outline  terms  of  reference.  The  consultants  are  to  be  recruited  as  an \nassociation  of  international  and  domestic  firms  or  individuals,  as  appropriate,  engaged  by  the \nGovernment. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants  or,  for  NDF-funded  services,  in  accordance  with  NDF  recruitment  guidelines. \nServices  have  been  divided  into  the  following  four  packages:  (i)  construction  supervision, \nprojection preparation, and social action plans. Recruitment for this package of services will be \nbased  on  NDF  guidelines;  (ii)  strengthening  of  social  and  environmental  management.\nRecruitment  for  this  package  will  be  based  on  procedures  for  the  recruitment  of  individual \nconsultants  following  ADB  guidelines;  (iii)  the  Road  Safety  Program.  Recruitment  for  this \npackage  of  services  will  be  based  on  NDF  guidelines;  and  (iv)  graduate  education  for \nenvironmental/social  staff. Recruitment  for  this  package  will  be  based  on  direct  selection \nfollowing ADB guidelines, the services will comprise of appropriate courses from an established \ninstitution  of  higher  education.  Direct  selection is  justified  because  the course  content  must  be \nappropriate  for  needs  of  staff  from  the  DOR  Environmental  and  Social  Division.  MCTPC  will \nevaluate  available  courses,  then  submit  recommendations  for  selected  courses  for  ADB \napproval before recruitment.\n\n41. \nAfter  discussions  among  MCTPC,  NDF,  and  ADB,  assurances  were  made  regarding \narrangements  for  the  recruitment  and  supervision  of  the  NDF-funded  consultants.  Consultant \nrecruitment  through  NDF-financed  packages  will  begin  upon  approval  of  the  NDF  loan. \nAllowance for this was made in the project implementation schedule. \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n42. \nLoan disbursements for all contracts for consulting services and civil works that were bid \nunder  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  through  direct  payment  procedures \n\n\f13\n\ndefined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Disbursements for local competitive bidding for \ncivil  works  contracts  and  for  incremental  expenditures  will  be  through  an  imprest  account \nestablished for the Project. To expedite flows of funds, statements of expenditure will be used for \nall payments of less than $100,000. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n43. \nThe  EA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to  document  goods  and  services \nfinanced  from  loan  proceeds,  financial  resources  received,  project  expenditures,  audit  of \nresettlement expenditures, and use of local funds. Within 9 months of the close of the fiscal year, \nMCTPC will submit to ADB audited annual project accounts that describe, in detail, the sources \nof  funds  and  expenditures  made.  An  auditor  who  is  acceptable  to  ADB  must  audit  the  annual \nproject accounts. ADB must approve the auditor\u2019s terms of reference before work begins. Audit \nresults will be submitted to ADB annually. \n\n44.  MCTPC  will  prepare  and  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the  Project\u2019s  physical \nprogress,  procurement  and  contractual  status,  and  implementation  highlights.  The  progress \nreports  should  include  summaries  of  project  accounts,  including  details  on  the  latest  project \nexpenditures and contract amounts. The reports will include an evaluation of progress in project \nimplementation.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  MCTPC  will  furnish  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  covering  details  of  the  project  implementation,  costs,  and  benefit  monitoring \nand evaluation indicators. \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n45. \nThe  EA,  with  consultant\u2019s  assistance,  will  establish  systematic  performance  monitoring \nand  analysis  throughout  the  Project\u2019s  life  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance \nManagement  System  Handbook,  which  will  be  integrated  with  the  existing  management \ninformation system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and conduct sample surveys to \nestablish  baseline  data  for  subsequent  monitoring  of  performance,  and  will  generate  base  line \ndata  on  pre-project  social  and  economic  living  conditions  for  direct  project  beneficiaries.  A \nsecond survey, to measure impacts, will be implemented on project completion. A third survey, \nto measure subsequent impacts, will be conducted no later than 2 years after project completion. \nThe  baseline  and  impact  surveys  will  include  control  areas  and  assessment  of  all  project \ninterventions, including resettlement and other safeguard interventions that affect the livelihood \nof  project  beneficiaries.  Also,  a  set  of  indicators  will  be  developed  to  assess  how  improved \naccessibility  affects  the  area.  Indicators  will  reflect  transport  costs,  tariffs,  and  mobility.  District \nindicators will include multisectoral indicators such as agricultural productivity, economic activity, \nand  indicators  of  health  and  education  indicators.  Development  impacts  on  the  poor,  from \nimproved road access, will receive particular attention. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n46. \nBesides regular ADB reviews, there will be a midterm review of project implementation in \nthe  third  year.  This  review  will  involve  representatives  of  ADB,  the  Government,  and \ncofinanciers. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful \nproject implementation and achievement of objectives. \n\n\f14\n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n47. \nThe Project will promote economic growth and social development in rural areas where \naccess  is  severely  constrained  by  establishing  efficient  all-weather  road  access  to  the  Sanxai \narea  in  Attapeu  Province,  the  Thasi  area  in  Borikhamxay  Province,  the  Ban  Vang  area  in \nVientiane Province, and the Hongsa-Thaxoang area in Sayabury Province. Project benefits will \nbe directly related to traffic, including (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in costs of \nfreight and passenger time, and (iii) induced benefits from traffic generated by the reduction in \ntransport  costs  and  improvement  of  accessibility.  Based  on  assessment  of  the  direct  benefits \nand costs, an estimate of the Project\u2019s economic viability was prepared. It indicates the Project's \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  17.1%.  The  benefit  and  cost  analysis  also  showed \nthat  the  Hongsa-Ngeun  road,  one  of  six  roads  examined  for  inclusion,  was  not  economically \nviable, so it was excluded. The Sayabury-Hongsa road is marginally economically viable, but the \nextent of rehabilitated is subject to budget availability and the economic viability of rehabilitating \nits various subsections. Indirect benefits from generated traffic include producer surplus benefits \nand additional income and employment in other sectors due to increased agricultural activity and \nincome. These benefits were not included in the quantitative assessment of benefits. Therefore, \nthe EIRR can be regarded as a conservative estimate of economic and development impacts. \n\n48.  Work has been undertaken to examine the distributional impacts of the project roads. Net \neconomic benefits have been distributed among key stakeholders, including poor and non-poor \nend users. The poor are estimated to comprise 60% of the project beneficiaries, and the poverty \nimpact  ratio  (PIR)  is  estimated  at  0.82.  This  shows  that  the  requirements  have  been  met  for \nclassification as a core poverty intervention based on (i) most beneficiaries are below the poverty \nline and (ii) the poor will reap most of the benefits. The distribution analysis further shows that \nthe  extent  of  transmission  of  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  to  end  users  impacts  the  PIR \nsignificantly. But risk analysis indicates more than an 80% chance that the project PIR will be at \nleast  0.50.  Appendix  11  summarizes  economic  analyses  for  the  Project.  Supplementary \nAppendix D describes the analyses in more detail.  \n\n2. \n\nEthnic Minority and Other Vulnerable Groups  \n\nThe Project will increase the benefits accruing to vulnerable ethnic minority communities \n49. \non  two  roads  from  economic  and  other  opportunities  that  road  improvements  will  bring  by \nimproving literacy, numeracy, and small business skills through a nonformal education program. \nThe  Project  will  also provide  the  opportunity  for  the  two  vulnerable  communities  to  sustainably \nmanage  their  nontimber  forest  product  resources,  and  to  protect  them  from  exploitation  due  to \nincreased access. The Project will also enable those villages to maintain or preferably, improve \ntheir  household  and  community  sources  of  income  and  livelihood.  All  people  along  the  road, \nincluding ethnic minorities, will benefit from land use rights certificates. \n\nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n50. \nPoverty in the project areas ranges from more than 87% to about 7%. The project roads \nconnect  rice-deficit  areas,  with  high  poverty  and  vulnerability,  with  rice-surplus  areas,  where \n\n\f15\n\npoverty  is  substantially  lower  and  welfare,  generally  higher.  Relationships  of  rice  deficits,  low \naccessibility,  and  poverty  are  visible  along  the  project  roads.  Differences  in  prices,  reflecting \ndifferences in market access, are significant among road segments. Prices of inputs and outputs, \nand  of  food,  are  expected  to  decrease.  This  will  encourage  agriculture  beyond  subsistence \nproduction,  and  improve  livelihoods  of  marginal  farmers  who  are  now  unable,  or  face \ndisincentives, to invest to improve productivity. Food prices for the landless poor will decrease, \nand increased local production and inflow of food will reduce their vulnerability. This impact could \nbe the single most important factor in reducing food poverty15 in access-deprived communities. \n\n51. \nOpportunities for nonfarm employment are expected to increase, both through improved \nmobility  of  local  people,  and  better  investment  opportunities  because  of  better  market  access. \nThis will, in turn, reduce dependence on subsistence farming, and resulting vulnerability. Another \nkey  impact  identified  is  through  better  access  to  medical  facilities  and  services.  The  access-\ndeprived communities now have no access to medical services for several months of the year. \nFurthermore,  improved  road  access  will  greatly  enhance  the  public  sector\u2019s  ability  to  provide \nthese  services  efficiently.  Appendix  12  summarizes  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategies.\n\n52. \nThe impact on poverty was quantified by examining the share of total net benefits to the \npoor (Appendix 11, Supplementary Appendix D). A distribution analysis suggests that economic \nbenefits generated by the proposed project will be strongly pro-poor. Four subprojects have PIRs \nfrom  0.54  to  0.82,  implying  that  they  disproportionately  benefit  the  poor.  The  fifth  subproject \n(where  a  PIR  cannot  be  computed  for  technical  reasons)  generates  pro-poor  growth  in  the \nstrictest sense, such as the redistribution of resources from rich to poor. Overall, the Project has \na 0.82 PIR. The high PIR reflects a high incidence of poverty among direct beneficiaries and a \nsubstantial net transfer of resources from the overall economy to the project area. An important \nunderlying assumption is that project benefits, mostly savings in vehicle operating costs and time \nsavings for travelers, are substantially transferred to end users. Here it has been assumed that \ntwo thirds of savings in vehicle operating costs are transmitted into lower transport charges for \nend users. Sensitivity analysis shows that this proportion can be reduced to about 35%, before \nthe PIR falls below 0.50.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n53. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  Category  B  (sensitive),  as  defined  in  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy.  Project  work  is  mostly  to  improve  existing  accesses,  but  short  lengths  of \nnew road will be built to either bypass towns or to avoid steep gradients. No project roads pass \nthrough  \u201cNational  Biodiversity  Conservation  Areas,\u201d  but  one  road  passes  through  an  area \nclassified as a \u201cDistrict Biodiversity Conservation Area\u201d that could be considered environmentally \nsensitive.  The  Project  will  have  short-term  and  manageable  environmental  impacts,  mainly \nrelated  to  construction.  The  Project  also  includes  construction  of  facilities  for  forest  product \ncontrol, for each project road. The Project also includes a capacity building component that will \nstrengthen  DOR\u2019s  Social  and  Environment  Division  in  managing  social  and  environmental \nimpacts  of  road  projects.  Adverse  impacts  from  the  Project  will  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation of construction environmental  management plans (EMPs) that will be prepared \nbased  on  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  program  prescribed  in  the  Project\u2019s  initial \nenvironmental examination. Under the Project, EMPs will be prepared for the Pakton-Ban Vang \nand  Hongsa-Thaxoan  roads,  taking  into  account  potential  impacts  identified  through  design \nwork.  A  construction  EMP  will  be  prepared,  and  will  address  specific  requirements  for  each \n\n                                                \n15 The food poverty line represents the lower poverty line (e.g., \u201cthe poorest of the poor\u201d).  \n\n\f16\n\nproject  road.  DOR\u2019s  Social  and  Environmental  Division  will  ensure  timely  address  of  these \nimpacts.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  includes  the  Project\u2019s  SIEE,  which  was  circulated  to  the \nBoard  on  4  February  2004  to  meet  its  requirement  of  circulation  at  least  120  days  before \nconsideration of a loan.   \n\n54.  MCTPC  has  obtained  approval  from  the  Attapeu  provincial  government  to  upgrade  the \nXaisetha-Sanxai  road.  The  approval  was  issued  under  regulations  governing  the  management \nand administration of the Phou Kathong District Biodiversity Conservation Area. \n\n3. \n\nResettlement  \n\n55. \nThe Project will cause significant involuntary resettlement, including relocation of houses \nand loss of agricultural and homestead land (para. 21). Land acquisition has been minimized by \nconstruction  of  a  bypass  in  Bolikham  on  the  Pakxane-Thasi  road,  and  by  minimizing  the \nconstruction  corridors.  Adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the Lao PDR \nGovernment\u2019s  Decree  on  Resettlement  and  Compensation.  The  objective  is  to  improve  or  at \nleast restore current living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels of affected \npeople. Special assistance will be given to help the poorest and most vulnerable people improve \ntheir socioeconomic status. \n\n4. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDs  and  other  STDs \nbecause  of  the  influx  of  construction  workers  and  increased  communication.  This  potential  will \nbe  mitigated  or  minimized  through  a  program  to  increase  awareness  and  provide  preventive \nmeasures for the local communities, mobile populations, and construction workers. \n\n5. \n\nTrafficking of Women and Children  \n\n57. \nBetter  roads  facilitate  movement  away  from  communities  that  offer  few  employment  or \nlivelihood options. Such migration can be positive, if the process is safe. But such migration can \nalso cause exploitation by human traffickers. The construction phase will bring large numbers of \ntemporary laborers and with them, increased demand for sex workers, introduction of new ideas, \nand  employment  opportunities.  Efforts  to  raise  awareness  of  the  dangers  of  trafficking,  and \nproviding safe migration services, will help prevent negative effects from increased mobility from \nareas  with  improved  roads  and  from  the  influx  of  outside  laborers.  The  Projects  includes  no \ninternational border crossings.\n\n6. \n\nTraffic Safety  \n\n58. \nRoad improvements will increase the potential for traffic accidents because of increased \ntraffic volumes and higher speed. The roads are currently an integral part of village communities; \nchildren  play  in  the  road,  and  animals  and  pedestrians  amble  across  them.  The  potential  for \nincreased  accidents  will  be  mitigated  by  erection  of  bamboo  fences  along  village  household \nproperties,  introduction  of  traffic  safety  measures,  and  community  road  safety  and  awareness \nprograms.\n\n\f17\n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n59. \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  during  construction  are  (i)  delayed  or \ninadequate  execution  of  mitigating  measures,  especially  for  resettlement;  (ii)  delayed  or  poor \nperformance  of  contractors  and  supervisors;  (iii)  delayed  funding  for  procurement  and  local \ncounterparts;  and  (iv)  environmental  degradation  due  to  insufficient  cleanup  and  mitigation  by \nthe  contractors.  After  construction,  the  main  risks  are  (i)  lower-than-expected  traffic,  (ii) \ninadequate  transfer  of  savings  in  vehicle  operation  costs  to  users  of  public  transport,  (iii) \nincreased  traffic  accidents  and  fatalities,  and  (iv)  insufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance. \nLesser risks are failure of transport provision and failure of agricultural development because of \nunrelated  constraints.  Neither  risk  is  considered  likely  to  materialize,  given  the  findings  of  the \npreparatory TA and previous project experience. Other concerns are the risks of increased illegal \nlogging, increased illegal wildlife endangerment and/or gathering, illegal trafficking of women and \nchildren  across  borders,  and  increased  land  grabbing  due  to  insecure  land  tenure  by  persons \nwith  land  near  the  rehabilitated  roads.  The  Project\u2019s  interventions  and  mitigating  measures \nshould adequately alleviate these concerns. Considering the Project\u2019s high economic return, the \nbenefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n60.\nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents: \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\nConsulting Services Cofinanced by the Nordic Development Fund \n\nThe scope of services for the recruitment of consultants for the Project will be on \nthe basis of terms of reference mutually agreed to by ADB, the Government and \nthe  NDF.  Substantive  changes  to  these  terms  will  be  implemented  only  with  the \nagreement of these agencies. \n\nMCTPC  will  ensure  the  timely  recruitment  of  consultants  under  NDF  funding  so \nthat  their  services  are  available  at  the  times  and  places  agreed  in  the  project \nimplementation schedule. For both Package 1, \u201cConstruction Supervision, Project \nPreparation,  and  Social  Action  Plan,\u201d  and  Package  3,  \u201cRoad  Safety  Program,\u201d \nrecruitment  shall  be  completed  and  a  contract  signed  within  12  months  of  the \nLoan Agreement. \n\nDuring  recruitment  for  each  consulting  services  package,  MCTPC  will  provide \nADB  with  copies  of  the  same  documents  submitted  to  NDF  for  approval,  for \nreview by ADB on a no-objections basis.  \n\nSocial and Resettlement \n\nAny update of a Resettlement Plan (RP) will be prepared in full consultation with \naffected persons and disclosed to the affected persons prior to submitting to ADB.  \nAn  updated  RP  is  required  before  the  implementation  of  an  RP  can  commence. \nFor  an  updated  RP,  the  Government  will  undertake  a  detailed  measurement \nsurvey  and  derive  updated  compensation  unit  rates  for  all  categories  of  losses \nand allowances. The Government will provide to ADB a final database of affected \n\n\f18\n\npersons,  a  summary  of  the  updated  detailed  measurement  survey  data,  and \nreplacement cost tables for each road. An updated RP must include any revisions \nto  the  entitlement  matrix,  these  revisions  are  limited  to  (a)  inclusion  of  new \nentitlements  to  address  impacts  not  previously  recognized,  or  (b)  changes  of \nmode of payment from cash to in-kind. In no case will a reduction in the monetary \nvalue  of  any  allowance  be  allowed  regardless  of  whether  payment  is  made  in \ncash or in-kind. Compensation for lost assets will be based on replacement cost. \nAn  updated  RP,  incorporating  the  above,  will  be  submitted  for  approval  by  the \nADB. The approved updated RPs will be implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nIf  significant  realignment  of  any  part  of  a  road  is  required  that  will  involve \nresettlement or land acquisition after an updated RP is approved, the Government \nwill  revise  and  update  the  RP.  The  updated  RP  must  be  submitted  for  ADB \napproval  before  any  land  acquisition  activities  begin.  Realignment  is  considered \nsignificant  when  the  road  alignment  is  moved  entirely  outside  the  construction \ncorridor  of  the  previous  design  over  a  distance  of  more  than  100  meters.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  the  RP  for  each  road  is  revised  and  updated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.\n\nIf \nthe  Hongsa-Thaxoang  and  Pakton-Ban  Vang  subprojects  will  cause \nresettlement impacts, the Government will prepare an RP for each subproject and \nsubmit  for  ADB  approval.  The  RPs  will  be  prepared  after  completion  of  detailed \ndesign  but  before  land  acquisition  begins.  These  RPs  will  include  detailed \nmeasurement  surveys,  compensation  unit  rates  for  all  categories  of  losses  and \nallowances, and a final database of affected persons. \n\nContractors  will  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  the  same \ntypes  of  work.  Child  labor  is  not  permitted  on  any  of  the  Project\u2019s  construction \nactivities or camps. \n\nThe  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to  implement  all  RPs  and \ncommunity development plans for each road, and the social action plan, to ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction,  including  full  implementation  of  specific  provisions  for  ethnic \nminorities, and provision of adequate counterpart funding to cover actual costs. \n\nProvisions  will  be  made  in  civil  works  contracts  for  contractors  to  assist  the \nGovernment in preparation of land for use as resettlement sites or for agriculture, \nand provision of materials to be given to affected people as set out in the updated \nRP.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  affected  people  are  informed  of  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities. \n\nThe Government will ensure that civil works contractors will not be issued notices \nof possession of site for any section of a road to begin construction work unless \nthe Government has (a) satisfactorily completed, in accordance with the approved \nRP,  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites;  and  (b)  ensured  that \nrehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is free of \nencumbrances.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n\f19\n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(ii) \n\n4. \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe  Borrower  shall  have  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  contractors  prepare  detailed \nconstruction  environmental  management  plans  (CEMPs)  for  each  project  road. \nThe  Borrower  shall  ensure  that  CEMPs  will  (a)  be  based  on  recommendations \nfrom  the  Project  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  (b)  follow  requirements \nunder the ADB\u2019s environmental policies, and (c) be submitted to ADB and MCTCP \nfor approval.\n\nThe  Borrower  shall  (a)  prepare  the  Project  Environmental  Management  Plans \n(PEMPs)  to  monitor  the  contractors\u2019  implementation  of  CEMPs;  (b)  ensure  that \nspecific  provisions  are \nimplementation,  and \nmonitoring of CEMPs, in civil works contracts, and PEMPs, in consulting services \ncontracts,  together  with  budget  allowances  for  these  provisions;  and  (c)  ensure \nthat  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  in  the  IEE  will  be  adequately \nimplemented by the contractors. \n\nthe  preparation, \n\nincluded \n\nfor \n\nThe  Borrower  shall  ensure \nthat  construction  and  project  environmental \nimplementation  plans  are  adequately  monitored,  with  regular  reporting  to  the \nBorrower\u2019s environmental regulatory authority and ADB. \n\nOther \n\nAxle Load and Forestry Checkpoints. Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, \nthe Government will propose details of checkpoints to control movement of forest \nproducts,  endangered  species,  and  rare  wildlife;  and  the  overloading  of  trucks.  \nCheckpoints for each project road will be fully operational before its civil works are \ncompleted.  The  Government  will  provide  annual  reports  on  the  status  of  load \nenforcement  measures  and  incidence  of  vehicle  overloading,  beginning  1  year \nafter establishment of the first checkpoint on any project road. \n\nOperation  and  Maintenance.  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  Project  roads  through  proper  technical  supervision  and \nadequate allocation of funds. The completed Project roads will be maintained to a \nstandard  consistent  what  was  adopted  for  the  Lao  PDR  national  road  network \nunder the Road Maintenance Fund. \n\nSocial  Action  Plan.    The  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to \nimplement, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, the social action plan developed and approved \nfor  the  Project.  A  community  participatory  approach,  using  committees,  will  be \nused.  The  Government  will  promote  the  representation  and  full  participation  of \nwomen through committee membership. \n\nHealth Risks. The Government will ensure that all civil works contracts include a \nline item for contracting a qualified NGO to conduct an information and education \ncampaign on HIV/AIDS and other STDs, and on trafficking in women and children. \nThe  targets  will  be  construction  workers  and  communities  along  the  roads.

Based  on  the  5-year  development  plan,  the \nprovinces  prepare  and  submit  annual  implementation  plans  for  transport  projects  to  MCTPC, \nwhich then submits the plans to the Committee for Planning and Cooperation for approval. \n\n2. \nThe  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  in  MCTPC  is  responsible  for  the  administration, \nplanning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  national  roads.  DOR  monitors  maintenance \nprograms  for  national  roads  and  assists  the  provinces  with  implementation  and  monitoring  of \nroad  improvement  and  maintenance  programs  for  the  local  road  network.  The  actual \nresponsibility for execution of all routine and periodic maintenance is delegated to the provincial \nDepartments of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPCs), which also cover \ndistrict  and  community  roads,  and  access  roads.  DCTPCs  are  the  provincial  arms  of  MCTPC, \nand  are  responsible  both  to  Government  through  the  MCTPC  and  to  the  provincial \nadministrations. Staff of DCTPCs are appointed partly by MCTPC, and partly by the provinces.  \nWithin the road sector, the DCTPC responsibilities include maintenance of national roads within \neach  province,  and  full  responsibility  for  construction,  improvement,  and  maintenance  of  the \nlocal road networks (provincial, district, and community roads). Each province has an average of \n75 DCTPC staff.  \n\n3. \nAs  of  June  2003,  DOR  has  90  permanent  staff;  72  are  professional  staff  and  18, \ntechnical  or  administrative.  But  another  41  staff  are  assigned  to  externally  financed  projects, \nbringing to total to 131.  \n\n2. \n\nRoad Network \n\n4. \nTransport in the Lao PDR is almost exclusively road-based. Roads, a key element of the \nbasic  infrastructure,  carrying  about  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  freight  and  90%  of  passenger  traffic. \nThus,  roads  are  the  main  enabling  environment  to  support  regional  and  international  trade. \nDespite  many  advances  in  its  national  network,  the  Lao  PDR  continues  to  lag  behind  its \nneighbors  in  road  infrastructure  and  the  estimated  national  road  network  density  is  extremely \nlow:  about  0.14  kilometers(km)/square  km.  The  Lao  PDR  has  a  road  network  of  about  32,600 \nkm;  national  roads  comprise  22%;  provincial  roads,  28%;  urban  roads,  4%;  and  district  or \ncommunity roads, 46%. Only 14% of the total road network is paved; the other roads have gravel \nor  earth  surfaces.  Many  of  the  local  roads  are mere  tracks  and  are  impassable  during  the  wet \nseason. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is improving. But 4 of the 18 \nprovincial  capitals  remain  without  sealed,  all-weather  road  links.  Rehabilitation  of  some  roads \nincluded in the official national road network is still in the planning stage. The rehabilitation and \nimprovement  of  the  roads  forming  the  core  arterial  network  have  been  completed,  or  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  with  assistance  from  external  financing  agencies,  by  2005.  National \nRoad (NR) 3, linking Thailand to China via the Lao PDR, is to be completed by 2007.  \n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n3. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Traffic \n\n \n\n5. \nTable A1.1 describes the registered vehicle fleet, including Government vehicles, \nfor  1995\u20132001.  The  annual  growth  rate  averages  about  12%;  the  highest  growth  rate  is  in \nmotorcycles.  The  traffic  level  is  generally  low  on  national  and  provincial  roads  throughout  the \nLao PDR. Except areas around Vientiane and Savannakhet, traffic levels on the national network \nare lower than 1,000 average annual daily traffic (AADT), and on most sections, less than 500 \nAADT. Traffic on provincial roads is generally below 100 AADT.   \n\nTable A1.1: Registered Vehicle Fleet \n(no.)\n\nYear Motorcycles  Three Wheelers  Cars  Pickups  Jeeps  Buses  Large Buses  Trucks \n\nTotal \n\n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \nSource: Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction.\n\n104,879 \n120,373 \n132,552 \n141,678 \n143,846 \n146,507 \n168,379 \n\n9,855\n10,650 \n11,671 \n12,707 \n13,764 \n14,294 \n17,581 \n\n2,103\n2,440\n2,743\n3,173\n3,828\n3,980\n4,355\n\n7,588\n7,801\n8,061\n8,290\n8,461\n8,789\n9,428\n\n3,833\n4,163\n4,215\n4,235\n4,235\n4,235\n4,405\n\n962\n1,080\n1,223\n1,405\n1,630\n1,863\n2,603\n\n1,673\n1,673\n1,694\n1,720\n1,760\n1,790\n1,899\n\n7,714\n8,122\n8,468\n8,861\n9,517\n9,982\n11,841 \n\n138,607 \n156,302 \n170,627 \n182,069 \n187,041 \n191,440 \n220,491 \n\n4. \n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n\n6. \nRoad  expenditures  are  financed  from  general  budgetary  allocations,  and  foreign  loans \nand  grants.  Maintenance  is  funded  through  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF).  Road  sector \nrevenues consist of sales and import duties on vehicles, spare parts, tires, and automotive fuel \nproducts,  as  well  as  annual  fees  for  vehicle  licenses,  registration,  inspection,  and  drivers \nlicenses.  RMF  is  also  generated  from  a  fuel  levy,  heavy  vehicle  surcharge,  tolls,  international \ntransit fees, overloading fines, and other road-user charges. \n\n7. \nIn  current  kip  terms,  annual  road  sector  expenditures  have  generally  been  stable,  both \nfor  construction  and  maintenance,  in  recent  years.  Table  A1.2  shows  the  MCTPC  budget  and \nexpenditures for roads for FY2000\u201301 and FY2001\u201302, and the budget for FY2002\u201303. \n\nTable A1.2: MCTPC Budget and Expenditures \n(KN)\n\n200\u201301 \n\n2001\u201302 \n\n2002-03 \n\nItem \n\nTotal Annual \nBudget \n\nTotal Annual \nExpenditure \n\nTotal Annual \nBudget \n\nTotal Annual \nExpenditure \n\nTotal Annual \nBudget \n\nLocal Budget \n\n66,663 \n\n67,867 \n\n73,734 \n\n62,368 \n\n68,090 \n\nForeign \nBudget \nTotal \nMCTPC  = Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction \nSource: MCTPC. \n\n548,478 \n615,141 \n\n359,721 \n427,588 \n\n272,783 \n346,517 \n\n398,454 \n460,822 \n\n \n\n336,618 \n404,709 \n\n8. \nThe  corresponding  revenues  and  expenditure  of  the  RMF  in  its  first  year  of  operation \n(FY2001\u201303),  and  the  plan  for  FY2002\u201303  are  shown  in  Tables  A1.3  and  A1.4.

More  than  20  different  tax \n9.\nrates,  depending  on  vehicle  type,  engine  size,  gross  vehicle  weight,  and  number  of  seats,  are \napplied  on  the  total  2001  fleet  of  about  220,500  vehicles.  But  much  of  the  fleet  is  government \nvehicles,  which  are  exempt  from  taxes.  Various  other  annual  charges  also  exist,  such  as \ntemporary registration charges for foreign-registered vehicles, first-time registration charges (by \na particular owner), and miscellaneous charges such as for changing a vehicle\u2019s color, and loss \nof registration documents. There are also one-time fees for the issue of driver\u2019s licenses.  But all \nthose fees combined comprise only a minor revenue source. \n\n5. \n\nMaintenance \n\n10. \nThe  Government  established  the  RMF  in  2001  as  a  means  of  providing  sustainable, \ndomestic  funding  for  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network  and,  eventually,  all  roads.  The \nRMF1 is based on the principles of: (i) Funding. Road user fees are to contribute to the cost of \nmaintaining the national road network, with 10% of RMF revenues initially going to local roads, \nand  the  RMF  progressively  contributing  to  the  full  cost  of  maintaining  all  roads;  (ii) \nIndependence. An RMF board under MCTPC, which includes private sector representation, is \nto supervise, direct, and make recommendations on matters related to the overall management \nand  financing  of  road  maintenance;  (iii)  Revenues. Revenues  are  to  be  derived  from  user \ncharges,  primarily  a  fuel  levy  on  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel,  heavy  vehicle  surcharges,  tolls,  and \ninternational  transit  charges.  The  fuel  levy  will  be  adjusted  annually,  collected  independently, \nand deposited directly to the RMF; (iv) Application. The priority is to be routine maintenance; (v) \nAdministration. RMF is a separate account, operated and managed by the RMF board, and is \nnot  part  of  the  Government's  general  revenue;  (vi)  Allocation. Allocation  for  network \nmaintenance  is  to  be  based  on  needs,  functional  classification,  and  economic  considerations; \nand  (vii)  Auditing  and  reporting.  Accounts  are  subject  to  annual  audits,  by  independent \nauditors, in compliance with Government regulations.  \n\n11. \nThe  initial  charge  for  the  fuel  levy  is  $0.01/liter,  with  an  annual  increase  of  50%  from \n2002 to 2004, and 27% afterward. The annual heavy vehicle surcharges range from $25 for 2- to \n\n                                                \n1   Decree 09/PM establishing the RMF was enacted by Government in January 2001. \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n4-ton trucks to $55 for trucks of 7 tons and heavier; and $15 for 12- to 24-seater buses and  $40 \nfor buses of 42 seats or more. In effect, the RMF treats roads much like other utilities such as \ntelecommunications,  electricity,  and  water  supply.    Road  users  pay  an  access  charge  through \nthe annual license fee, then pay according to road use through levies on items such as on fuel, \ntolls, and overloading fines. FY2001\u201302 was the RMF\u2019s first operating period. \n\n12. \nThe  Road  Maintenance  Project  (RMP),  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  is  a  major  step \ntoward  developing  sustainable  mechanisms  to  manage  and  finance  all  national,  provincial, \ndistrict,  and  rural  roads.  Its  main  objective  is  the  sustainable  preservation  of  road  assets. \nFinancial projections for the RMF are shown in Appendix 5. \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n13. \nThe  Department  of  Planning  and  Budget  handles  accounting  and  financial  matters  of \nMCTPC,  with  all  transactions,  regardless  of  source,  passing  through  the  Department  of  Roads \n(DOR). DOR is MCTPC\u2019s largest office, accounting for 90% of the MCTPC budget and most of \nits foreign-aided projects. The DOR Disbursement Division handles the financial monitoring and \naccounting of projects. \n\nFunctional,  reliable,  and  efficient \n\n14. \nfor  effective \nadministration  and  internal  control.  Financial  and  accounting  systems  in  MCTPC  and  the \nDCTPCs  are  being  improved  continuously  to  provide  functional  and  reliable  reporting  and \naccounting of budget expenditure.  \n\nfinancial  systems  are  essential \n\nDOR  has  adopted  the  financial  management  system  developed  under  the  first  Lao-\n15. \nSwedish Road Sector Project (LSRSP-I) in order to meet the long-term objective of establishing \na  uniform  financial  and  accounting  system  that  includes  all  funding  sources  and  consolidates \nDCTPC  accounting  in  MCTPC.  The  system  covers  fund  disbursement  and  authorization, \nbudgeting  and  reporting,  and  accounting  and  auditing.  It  complies  with  generally  accepted \naccounting  principles,  and  Government  and  MCTPC  regulations  and  procedures.  The  World \nBank has also accepted the system for its projects. Recommended improvements in the system \ninclude: (i) inclusion of a uniform chart of accounts and account structure; (ii) accounting based \non the double-entry principle, and recording of transactions in journals and general ledgers; (iii) \nrecording of all transactions in one program; (iv) establishment of an accounting unit in the DOR \nDisbursement  Division  with  formal  responsibility  for  all  departmental  accounting  requirements; \n(v) coordination and consolidation of DCTPC budgets in MCTPC; (vi) inclusion of foreign-funded \nroad  projects  in  DOR  and  DCTPC  accounting  procedures;  (vii)  MCTPC  and  DCTPC \nmanagement  of  their  own  bank  accounts,  impress  accounts,  and  certify  payments  without \nMinistry  of  Finance  approval  for  foreign-funded  projects.  Table  A1.5  gives  the  status  of  these \nimprovements. \n\n16. \nThe MCTPC initiatives are recognized as complementary to the support given, through a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project2  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  the \nGovernment strengthen accounting systems at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and in some other \nline  ministries.  The  TA  for  accounting  is  expected  to  use  the  same  software  package  as \nMCTPC\u2019s financial management system.\n\n                                                \n2 ADB. 1999.

Under  the  World  Bank  RMP, \nMCTPC  is  implementing  a  Heavy  Transport  Management  Program  (HTMP),  whose  main \nactivities  comprise  review  of  existing  regulations,  enforcing  regulations,  providing  equipment \n(weigh  scales),  setting  up  about  30  weigh  stations,  and  training  and  supporting  a  public \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 1 \n\ninformation  campaign.  The  HTMP  is  complemented  by  earlier  and  ongoing  ADB  project \ncomponents  under  the  Xieng  Khouang  Road  Improvement  and  East-West  Corridor  projects  to \nestablish weigh stations, and supply their equipment. \n\n8. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n18. \nFatalities  through  road  accidents  rose  by  245%  from  1991  to  1999.  Road  accidents \nthemselves  increased  by  176%  during  the  same  period.  Road  fatalities  are  now  the  highest  in \nSoutheast  Asia,  at  almost  20  persons  per  10,000  vehicles.  The  figure  is  growing  and  the \npotential  for  even  greater  accident  rates  is  high,  with  the  current  rate  of  increase  in  vehicles, \ngrowing population, and improved road networks. (DOT\u2019s current target is to reduce the fatality \nrate  to  10  persons  per  10,000  vehicles.)  A  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  has  been  prepared \nthat  is  built around  five  elements  (i)  education, (ii)  enforcement,  (iii)  technical  environment,  (iv) \ncoordination, and (v) research and evaluation. The strategy\u2019s key issues are (i) improved driving \nskills,  (ii)  use  of  crash  helmets  for  motorcycle  drivers,  (iii)  improved  night  visibility  for \nmotorcyclists and cyclists, (iv) drunk driving, (v) speeding, (vi) traffic management, signing and \ndelineation of roads, and (vii) use of seat belts. The Strategy, which is awaiting final approval of \nthe  Prime  Minister,  envisages  implementation  through  a  national  road  safety  council  under \nMCTPC,  and  forging  of  a  road  safety  partnership  among  the  Traffic  Police  Department,  the \nDepartment  of  Transport,  and  the  Department  of  Education.  International  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  such  as  Handicap  International  support  efforts  to  create  a  network  to \nincrease awareness of road safety issues and to address the trauma of road accidents. \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Priorities for the Road Sector  \n\n19. \nThe  Government  has  given  high  priority  to  improvement  of  the  road  transport  system, \nmainly to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas, (ii) flow of \nconsumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and export of cash crops \nand other produce, and (iv) participation in regional and international trade.Targets for physical \ninfrastructure development include (i) completing the national road network, including road links \nwith Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet Nam, as well as road and bridge links \nwith  Thailand;  (ii)  improving  the  provincial  road network;  (iii)  upgrading  transit  routes  to  central \nViet  Nam  in  order  to  facilitate  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  international  trade  through  its  ports;  and  (iv) \nestablishing a sustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \nInfrastructure  development,  particularly  roads,  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  regional \ncooperation initiatives being developed under the ADB Greater Mekong Subregion initiative, as \nthe Lao PDR is located centrally among Cambodia, the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. All-weather access roads are being provided to 16 of the Government's \nlist of the 46 poorest districts through current or committed ADB projects including Xieng Khuang \nRoad  Improvement,  Rural  Access  Roads,  and  Roads  for  Rural  Development.  MCTPC  is \naddressing the issue of  districts that do not have year-round road access, or no access at any \ntime, through an ongoing plan as part of the National Poverty Eradication Programme. \n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Roads Sector  \n\n20. \nADB has been a major contributor to development of the road sector in the Lao PDR by \nproviding  11  loans  amounting  to  $319.0  million  and  30  TA  grants  totaling  $13.8  million.  ADB \nassistance to the sector represents 36% of the total assistance of $727.0 million by multilateral \nand bilateral organizations. Appendix 2 lists major externally financed projects. \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n27\n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\np\nx\nE\n\n

4 \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ROAD IMPROVEMENT \n\n1. \nA detailed description of road improvement works to be undertaken follows. This work will \nbe  undertaken  over  three  phases,  based  on  the  present  status  of  preparation  roads  will  be \nallocated to each phase on the basis of: \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\nPhase 1 Roads. Improvements to roads previously studied under Loan 1533, for which \ndetailed designs and contract documents are available; \n\nPhase  2  Roads.  Improvements  to  roads  for  which  favorable  rates  of  return  have  been \nidentified,  but  that  require  further  preparation  before  contracts  can  be  launched.  The \nscope of work outlined here for these roads is an outline description that may be changed \nafter more detailed design work; and \n\nPhase 3 Roads. During project preparation analyses showed that full upgrade is viable, \nand  full  documentation  for  implementation  has  been  prepared  on  this  basis,  but  the \nextent of work needs to be adjusted to reflect available funding. Once available funds are \nconfirmed, the implementation documentation will be revised appropriately. \n\nA. \n\nPhase 1 Roads \n\n1. \n\nPakxane-Thasi, Provincial Road 700, Borikhamxay Province \n\nAbout 78.3 kilometers (km) of existing gravel and earth road will be upgraded to either full \n2. \ngravel  or  paved  standard.  This  will  start  at  the  junction  of  the  project  road  with  Road  13  near \nPakxane.  This  is  km  0  for  the  Pakxane-Thasi  project,  which  ends  at  the  junction  with  Road  1 \nnear Thasi.  \n\n3. \nFrom km 0 to the district center of Borikhan at km 22.7, the existing gravel road will be \nupgraded to paved standard, comprising two 3.0-meter (m) wide lanes with paved shoulders 1.0-\nm wide, increased to 1.5-m wide through settlements. The terrain on this section is gently rolling, \nand its horizontal and vertical alignment will generally be followed with only minor improvements, \ngenerally contained within the right-of-way of the existing roads. The exception is the final 500 m \nwithin the settlement of Ban Vathad, where the road becomes urban in character, with housing \nand commercial development close to the road edge. Here the cross section will be modified to \nsuit the available corridor width, but the scope will also include a 1-km bypass on a more direct \nalignment  that  will  be  built  to  the  same  standard  as  the  rest  of  the  road  from  Pakxane.  Three \nsingle-span bailey bridges (a total span of 57 m) will be dismantled and replaced with beam and \nconcrete  slab  structures.  Pavement  construction  will  consist  of  200-millimeter  (mm)  crushed \naggregate  base  course  on  125-mm  aggregate  sub-base.  The  pavement  will  be  sealed  with \ndouble-surface  dressing,  and  shoulders  with  single-surface  dressing.  Design  speed  is  100 \nkilometers per hour (kph) in rural areas and 40 kph in urban areas. \n\nBetween Borikhan and the settlement of Ban Khen Yong at km 61.6, the existing gravel \n4. \nroad is to be widened to a 7.5-m formation width. The terrain varies from mountainous, where an \nescarpment is crossed just north of Borikhan, to gently rolling over most of the remaining route, \nalthough  there  are  steep  approaches  to  some  river  crossings.  The  existing  alignment  is  of \nsufficient standard to be followed over most of the route, with only minor adjustments to improve \nvisibility and the approaches to structures sites. Shallow embankments are to be built over low-\nlying sections. The road is to be upgraded to a sealed standard with two 2.75-m wide lanes and \n\n\fAppendix 4\n\n33\n\n1.0-m  shoulders.  A  175-mm  thick  crushed  aggregate  base  course  on  100-mm  aggregate  sub-\nbase  is  to  be  used.  Double-surface  dressing  will  be  applied  to  the  carriageway,  and  single-\nsurface dressing to the paved shoulders. Six existing bailey bridges, with a total span of 120 m, \nare  to  be  dismantled  and  replaced  with  either  bridges  (pre-stressed  beam  and  reinforced \nconcrete slab construction), or lower-level submersible crossings in reinforced concrete. Design \nspeed for this section varies from 40 to 60 kph, depending on terrain. \n\n5. \nA 100-m, four-span bridge is to be built across the Nam Xan river at km 61.3, with piers \nand  abutments  designed  to  carry  a  6-m  wide  concrete  deck.  But  bailey  bridge  sections  will  be \nrecycled from other bridge sites and used to build a single-lane deck as an interim measure until \ntraffic growth warrants upgrading to full-width concrete. \n\nFrom  Ban  Khen  Yong  to  Thasi,  the  road  enters  mountainous  terrain,  on  the  flanks  of \n6. \nsteep  hills  adjacent  to  the  Nam  Xan  River.  The  existing  narrow  track  is  to  be  widened  to \naccommodate a 3.5-m single lane paved road with 0.5-m shoulders. Passing places are to be at \n500- and 1,000-m intervals. A new alignment is to be cut over the last 3.0 km to avoid multiple \ncrossings  of  the  Nam  Mang  River.  Pavement  construction  will  be  150-mm  crushed  aggregate \nbase  on  150-mm  aggregate  sub-base.  All  paving  will  be  double-surface  dressing  with  single-\nsurface dressing applied to shoulders where slopes exceed 10%. One bridge (25-m span) and \none submersible crossing (12-m span) are to be built on this section, along with numerous box \nand pipe culverts. Design speed for this section is 40 kph. \n\n7. \nAll existing pipe culverts are to be replaced, or extended, with a total length of 2,934 m of \nnew  1.0-m  diameter  concrete  culverting.  Twenty-seven  concrete  box  culverts  of  up  to  3-m \nindividual span are to be built. Materials are to be sourced from previously identified borrow pits, \nand from river deposits. \n\n2. \n\nXaisetha-Sanxai Provincial Road 970, Attapeu Province  \n\n8. \nAbout  57  km  of  road  are  to  be  constructed,  either  by  upgrading  existing  earth/gravel \nroads and tracks, or by building new alignments in mountainous terrain. The project will start at \nthe turnoff to Ban Paam on Road 18B, about 3 km east of Xaisetha (which is about 10 km east \nof Attapeu). \n\n9. \nFrom km 0 to Ban Paam at km 16.6 the road traverses a flat plain and is to be widened \nand raised on shallow embankment to accommodate a new carriageway comprising two 2.75-m \nwide lanes with 1.0-m wide shoulders. The existing alignment is to be followed with only minor \nmodifications that can be accommodated within the designated road reserve. Shoulders are to \nbe  paved  through  two  small  settlements  and  through  Ban  Paam  itself.  One  bridge  and  one \nsubmersible crossing are to be built before the road reaches Ban Paam. Crossing of the Nam Pa \nRiver, at km 15.7, will be by a three-span bridge about 48 m long. Pavement construction will be \n150-mm  crushed  aggregate  base  course  on  150-mm  aggregate  sub-base  with  double-surface \ntreatment on the carriageway and single-surface treatment on paved sections of shoulder. The \ndesign speed is 80 kph on the rural parts of the section, and 40 kph within Ban Paam. \n\n10. \nFrom  km  16.6,  the  road  enters  mountainous  terrain  where  an  existing  3-m  wide \nearth/gravel track continues to about km 33. From there, an alternative alignment is to be located \nso that the climb to the plateau, about  600 m, can be at about 12% gradients. The contractor will \ndesign this section during execution of the works. About 3 km of new alignment is expected to be \nrequired.  The  existing  track  will  then  be  rejoined  at  about  km  43  (measured  on  the  new \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nalignment),  then  followed  along  an  undulating  ridge  to  the  village  of  Ban  Chauleunxai.  Two \nsettlements will be bypassed on the ridge, one to limit intrusion. \n\n11. \nThe  road  cross-section  from  km  16.6  onwards  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  vertical \nalignment  and  topography.  Where  slopes  exceed  5%,  the  road  will  be  constructed  to  3.5-m \nsingle-lane paved standard with 0.5-m wide shoulders. Shoulders will be sealed where gradients \nexceed 10%. Flatter sections will be constructed to 5.5-m wide gravel standard. It is anticipated \nthat about 22 km will be paved, and 18.5 km graveled. Passing places will be provided at 500 to \n1,000 m intervals on the 3.5-m wide paved sections. Pavement construction will consist of 150-\nmm  crushed  aggregate  base  course  on  150-mm  aggregate  sub-base.  Five  bridges  and \nsubmersible  crossings  will  be  constructed  with  a  combined  span  of  180  m.  The  submersible \ncrossing at km 28.4 has a span of 42 m. Structures will be single-lane width.  \n\n12. \nEarthworks beyond km 16.6 will be kept to a minimum by following existing road levels \nwherever possible. New alignments will be benched in, cut on the steep slopes with due regard \nfor slope stability. All new alignment construction will be paved to 3.5-m width. \n\n13. \nThe  area  is  one  of  the  most  highly  contaminated  by  unexploded  ordnance  in  the  Lao \nPDR,  so  extensive  clearance  may  be  necessary,  particularly  on  sections  of  new  alignment. \nSurveys will be undertaken to determine the extent of clearance necessary. \n\nAn  estimated  1,950  m  of  concrete  pipe  culverts  will  be  required,  along  with  nine  box \n\n14. \nculverts.\n\n15. \n\nDesign speed for the mountainous section is 40 kph. \n\nB. \n\nPhase 2 Roads \n\n1. \n\nPakton-Ban Vang, National Road 11, Vientiane Municipality and Province \n\n16. \nAbout  42  km  of  road  are  to  be  built,  of  which  23.9  km  will  be  new  construction.  The \nproject  begins  at  the  Nam  Sang  bridge  at  km  55.1  on  Road  11.  New  construction  is  required \nbetween the settlement of Ban Houayhang at km 68.1 and Ban Nam Hi at km 92.0. \n\n17. \nFrom the bridge the existing track, 3\u20134 m wide, is to be widened to accommodate a 5.5-\nm  wide  gravel  pavement  as  far  as  the  village  of  Ban  Houayhang  at  km  68.1.  Other \nimprovements to this section are to repair the decks of three existing bailey bridges (a total span \nof 39 m) and to install two more bailey bridges (a total span of 55 m) at km 61.6 and km 65.8. A \nfree-draining capping layer is to be placed on sections where water from springs seeps into the \nsubgrade.  For  erosion  protection,  rock-filled  gabion  baskets  are  to  be  installed  on  vulnerable \nsections where the bank of the Mekong River is unstable. Numerous pipe culverts and two box \nculverts are also to be constructed on this section. \n\n18. \nFrom Ban Houayhang the existing narrow walking track enters mainly rolling terrain with \noccasional steep sections, and is to be followed for most of the route to Ban Nam Hi at km 92. \nThe  new  road  will  be  benched  into  the  hill  flanks  or  built  close  to  the  bank  of  the  Mekong  on \nformations wide enough to accommodate a 5.5-m wide gravel pavement. Extensive earthworks \nwill  be  required,  including  rock  blasting  between  km  88.6  and  km  90.1  to  achieve  direct \nalignment and avoid a steep detour in the walking route. Bailey bridges are to be constructed at \nkm 73.6 (25-m span), km 84.4 (20-m span), and km 91.3 (30-m span). The total span is to be 75 \nm.  Five  box  culverts  and  a  number  of  1-m  diameter  pipe  culverts  are  also  to  be  built.  It  is \n\n\fAppendix 4\n\n35\n\nassumed that old bailey bridge decking will be available for new bridges. Erosion protection is to \nbe through gabion and slope revetment. \n\n19. \nIn Ban Nam Hi, a 5-m wide gravel track requires reshaping and regraveling as far as the \njunction  with  the  Hin  Hoep  road  at  km  95.8,  a  distance  of  about  3.8  km.  The  road  from  the \njunction at km 95.8 to Ban Vang at km 98.8 is in good condition, and requires no improvement. \n\n20. \n\nDesign speed for the road is 40 kph. \n\n2. \n\nHongsa-Thaxoang Road, Sayabury Province \n\n21. \nThe  25-km  Hongsa-Thaxoang  district  road  links  Hongsa  with  the  Mekong  River  at \nThaxoang  village.  The  road  begins  in  the  center  of  Hongsa  and  ends  at  the  river  bank  in \nThaxoang.  The  current  alignment  is  adequate,  and  will  need  only  minor  widening  to  improve \nvisibility  over  a  few  short  stretches.  The  proposed  work  includes  complete  regraveling  of  the \nroute, construction of some additional culverts, and construction of a low embankment over the \nfirst 4 km across the Hongsa plain. A 50-m, three-span concrete bridge is to be constructed over \nthe  Nam  Ken  River  near  where  the  road  begins.  The  bridge  is  to  be  6  m  wide,  including \nwalkways,  and  will  be  constructed  of  simply  supported,  prestressed  beams  of  reinforced \nconcrete  deck.

RMP-1 is coordinated with technical support \nto  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction  (MTCPT)  from  the \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) under the second Lao-Swedish Road Sector \nProject  (LSRSP-2).  ADB  had  previously  allocated  $2  million  to  the  funding  of  maintenance \nthrough RMF under Loan 1795-LAO.\n\n2. \nA  joint  World  Bank  and  Sida  mid-term  review  mission  visited  Laos  to  review  RMP-1  in \nOctober  2003.  The  mission  concluded  that  the  Project\u2014and  thus,  the  RMF\u2014was  developing \nsatisfactorily.  The  Project  was  meeting  its  development  objectives,  and  most  key  performance \nindicators  (KPIs)  had  been  met  for  this  stage.  The  review  mission  noted  that  three  trigger  KPI \ntargets  had  been  met,  so  appraisal for  phase  2  of  the  RMP  could  begin.  Most  remaining  KPIs \nhad met their targets, and the others were expected to meet targets, but with some delay. KPIs \nthat had already been met included: lengths of national and local roads subject to periodic and \nroutine maintenance; percentages of vehicles overloaded on national roads; review of the third \nmaintenance  program  (MP-3)  by  the  Road  Fund  Advisory  Board  (RMFAB);  publication  of \nRMFAB accounts and audit; production of performance monitoring reports; and establishment of \nvillage maintenance committees. KPIs that had been partially met include a 50% yearly increase \nin fuel levy  (one increase has been authorized, but a second is now overdue); prioritization of \nthe road maintenance program, using the road management system that has been established, \nand is now being tested through the RMP; operation of the monitoring and evaluation system for \nlocal roads (whose recent use is now being reviewed); and preparation of a national strategy for \ndevelopment of domestic contracting and consulting.  \n\n3. \nRMF was set up as a second-generation road fund that will collect road user charges to \nfinance  routine  and  periodic  road  maintenance.  Sources  of  income  are  road  tolls  on  selected \nroads  and  bridges,  overloading  fines,  an  annual  surcharge  on  the  registration  fee  for  heavy \nvehicles, international transit fees for trucks, and a fuel levy. The road tolls, the overloading fines \nand the fuel levy became effective in 2002. The fuel levy will be the main source of income. It \nwas  introduced  at  a  level  of  40  KN/  liter  (about  $0.04/liter),  and  is  set  to  increase  gradually  to \nabout  $0.4/liter  in  2010.  The  RMF  is  expected  to  be  fully  funded  from  road  user  charges  by \naround 2014 to 2015. In the interim, the shortfall will be partially covered by credit from the World \nBank\u2019s International Development Association, supplemented by allocations from other donors, \nand from the general budget.

It will involve \n328 affected persons (APs),2 including 201 affected structures (117 houses, 2 village offices, 37 \nsmall shops, and 45 rice bins). All are to be relocated within the same villages. Also, 76 trees are \nto be cleared from the construction corridors. Table A6.1 summarizes impacts for phase 1 and 3. \nImpacts arising from phase 2 roads will be determined under the Project after detailed design. \n\nTable A6.1: Loss of Land, Structures, and Trees \n\nRoad(a)\n\nBorikhamxay \nAttapeu\nSayabury \nProject\n\nLand \nArea \n(ha)\n\n15.26\n31.63\n18.19\n65.08\n\nPlot\n(no.)\n\n93\n114\n115\n322\n\nLand Acquisition \nAgricultural \nLand \n\nArea  \n(ha)\n\n0.71\n1.07\n0.54\n2.32\n\nPlots\n(no.)\n14\n30\n17\n61\n\nAffected Persons (APs) \n\nHomestead \n\nType of Impacts per APs \n\nArea  \n(ha)\n0.55\n0.56\n0.65\n1.76\n\nPlots\n(no.)\n79\n84\n98\n261\n\nTotal \nAPsb\n\n127\n84\n117\n328\n\nLand \nOnly \n55\n43\n27\n125\n\nLand with \nStructuresc\n\n63\n41\n90\n194\n\nTrees \nOnly \n9\n0\n0\n9\n\nAP = affected Person \n a  Resettlement  and  Community  Development  Plans  for  the  Hongsa-Thaxoang  road,  Sayabury  Province,  and  the \nPakton-Ban  Vang    road,  Vientiane  Province,  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework. \nDetailed designs  will be prepared and submitted to the  Asian Development Bank for approval under  phase 1 and \nwill be implemented under phase 2 before civil works begin.  \n\nb All  APs  in  Borikhamxay  and  Attapeu  are  affected  households,  while  APs  in  Sayabury  include  114  households,  1 \n\nschool, and 2 village offices.  c An AP may lose more than one structure (e.g. house, shop, rice bin).\n\nSource: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project \n\nThe  Project  has  minimized  resettlement  effects,  reducing  the  number  of  affected \n2. \nhouseholds, by bypassing Borikhan town on the Borikhamxay road. The Project is expected to \ncontinue to make every effort possible to reduce resettlement. Detailed designs of the phase 1 \nand  3  roads  have  already  been  done.  The  construction  supervision  consultants  will  review  the \ndesigns, and changes will be made, if necessary. Based on the final design, the Department of \nRoads  (DOR),  together  with  the  APs,  resettlement  consultants,  and  resettlement  committees, \nwill conduct a census, detailed measurement surveys (DMS), and surveys of replacement costs. \nThe final AP database, DMS summary, and table of replacement costs will be submitted to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for approval before any implementation begins. \n\nB. \n\nScope of the Resettlement and Community Development Plans and Framework  \n\n As part of project preparation, a social analysis was carried out along each of the phase \n3. \n1  and  3  roads.  A  census  and  inventory  of  lost  assets  were  conducted  for  all  households \npotentially  affected  by  loss  of  homestead  land  and  dwellings  within  15-meter  (m)  wide \nconstruction  corridors.  Based  on  the  information  collected  for  this  Right-of-Way,  three \nresettlement  and  community  development  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  Project  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \ndetermined that the mainly ethnic minority communities along the Attapeu and Sayabury roads \n                                                \n1 The phase 1 roads are Pakxane-Ban Thasi in Borikhamxay Province and Xaisetha-Sanxai in Attapeu Province. The \n\nphase 3 road is Sayabury-Hongsa in Sayabury Province. \n\n2 Affected Persons includes affected persons, households, firms, and public and private institutions. \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n39\n\nwill  be  vulnerable  as  a  result  of  the  road  improvements  because  of  their  low  literacy  and \nnumeracy levels. This triggered the need for ethnic minority development plans, as required by \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  But  because  the  ethnic  minority  families  are  integrated \nwith  the  non-minority  population,  the  term  \u201ccommunity  development  plan\u201d  has  been  used  to \nreplace  \u201cethnic  minority  development  plan.\u201d  The  community  plan  has  been  combined  with  the \nresettlement  plans.  A  resettlement  and  community  development  framework  has  also  been \nprepared  to  guide  in  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  planning  and  implementation  for  the \nother  two  subproject  roads  under  phase  2:  Hongsa-Thaxoang  in  Sayabury  Province,  and \nPakton-Ban  Vang  in  Vientiane  Province.  The  detailed  design  and  resettlement  and  community \ndevelopment plans of the latter roads will be done under the project. These will be prepared in \naccordance with the framework and submitted to ADB for approval before implementation. \n\nC. \n\nResettlement Policy Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n\n4. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  were  developed  according  to  laws  of  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (the  Lao  PDR)  and  ADB  policy,  mainly  (i)  the  Lao  Constitution \n(1991), (ii) the Land Law (1997),3 (iii) the draft National Policy and Decree for Resettlement & \nCompensation that was prepared under ADB\u2019s environment and social program loan,4 (iv) ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and (v) Government-approved resettlement plans for \nother ADB and World Bank projects. Provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement and \ncommunity  development  plans  for  the  Project  will  supersede  provisions  of  decrees  currently  in \nforce in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  \n\n5. \nThe project entitlements have been designed to provide compensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation  for  lost  assets,  and  to  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  categories  of \naffected people. That includes both those who are directly and indirectly affected, and both title \nholders  and  non-holders.  The  entitlement  matrix  for  the  Project  (Table  A6.2)  summarizes  the \nmain types of losses and the support entitled for each. Replacement costs and rates have been \nestablished in consultation with village administrations along each route. These rates have been \nused as the basis for estimates of resettlement costs. Final rates will be determined during the \nDMS and replacement cost surveys.  \n\nD. \n\nEthnic Minorities and Vulnerable Groups \n\n6. \nThe  social analysis  shows  high  proportions  of  ethnic  minority  groups  along  the Attapeu \nand  Sayabury  roads.  Special  attention  has  been  given  to  identifying  and  addressing  special \nneeds of these groups. These needs have been addressed in the community development plans \nthrough a nonformal education program to improve literacy, numeracy, and marketing skills. The \nBorikhamxay Resettlement Plan includes special action to assist villages with non-timber forest \nproduct (NTFP). Such action includes management to protect their livelihoods from exploitation \ndue  to  increased  access  both  to  the  NTFPs  and  to  their  markets  as  a  result  of  road \nimprovements.  \n\nE. \n\nResettlement Strategy and Income Restoration  \n\n7. \nLand  acquisition  impacts  and  rehabilitation  measures  have  been  assessed  at  an \nindividual and community level. During the detailed design, every effort will be made to reduce \nthe  need  for  relocation.  The  Project  will  assist  affected  households  and  villages,  through \n                                                \n3 The National Assembly passed the revised Land Law in October 2003, but it had not been translated, nor had the \n\nimplementing regulations been issued, at the time this report was prepared. \n\n4   Loan 1867-LAO (SF): Environment and Social Program, approved 6 December 2001. \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 6 \n\ncommunity mobilizers, to fence roadsides to prevent children and livestock from wandering onto \nthe  roads,  fence  vegetable  gardens,  expand  rice  paddy  land,  and  establish  fishponds.  The \nProject  will  help  households  that  must  move  by  leveling  land  that  the  village  administrations \nidentify  for  homestead  land  plots  and  livestock  pens.  Affected  persons  will  also  be  assisted  in \nrelocating  households  through  house  dismantling  and  rebuilding.  The Project  will also  facilitate \nthe issuance of land use rights certificates, and create awareness of land use rights in all project \nvillages.\n\nTypes of Losses \n\nLoss of Land \n(homestead ,orchard or \ngarden, agricultural, \ncommercial)\n\nLoss of Structures\n(residential and \ncommercial structures, \nrice bins, simple shops)   \n\nLoss of Standing \nCrops, Trees, and \nFruits \n\nTransition Subsistence \nAllowance (food \nsupport) \n\nMaterials Transport \nAllowance \nRepair Allowance \n\nLoss of Workday \nIncome Allowance \n\nAgricultural Extension \nAssistance\nSpecial Assistance to \nVulnerable Groups \n\nTable A6.2 Summary Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlements \n\na)  Permanent loss of land.

There is a shortage of \npaddy rice land in the villages along the road, but most communities have sufficient non-paddy \nland, so the Project will assist villages prepare paddy land by clearing and by providing \u201cfood-for-\nwork.\u201d  In  consultation  with  villages,  the  Project  will  dig  fishponds  at  appropriate  locations  in \nvillages along the road. Assistance in agricultural extension will be provided to severely affected \nfarmers  to  increase  productivity  on  remaining  and  new  land.  Affected  small  businesses  will  be \nhelped to move back from the road and still carry out their businesses\u2014but with better income \npotential.  Under  the  community  development  plans,  Attapeu  and  Sayabury  villages  will  be \nassisted  in  improvement  of  literacy,  numeracy,  and  marketing/small  business  skills.  The  NTFP \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n41\n\nmanagement  program \ncommunities\u2019 NTFP resources.\n\nfor  Borikhamxay  will  promote  sustainable  management  of \n\nthe \n\nF. \n\nParticipatory Process, Grievance Mechanisms, and Disclosure \n\n9. \nConsultation  has  been  extensive  since  the  preliminary  surveys  in  2000.  Social  and \nresettlement  surveys  undertaken  for  the  PPTA  have  continued  this  dialogue  with  affected \ncommunities. Although awareness of, and support for, the Project is high, a process must also \nbe  established  to  deal  with  issues  and  concerns  that  arise  during  project  implementation.  \nResettlement planning and implementation will follow a participatory approach, using facilitators \nto  mobilize  the  affected  communities  to  participate  in  alignment  selection,  inventory  of  losses, \nvalidation of compensation rates and entitlements, delivery of entitlements, monitoring of impacts \nand benefits, and design and participation in a grievance mechanism. The Project will also fund \na  social  action  plan  to  link  a  number  of  integrated  aspects  such  as  resettlement,  community \ndevelopment, awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS  and human trafficking, traffic safety, and \nawareness of land use rights. Design and implementation of the social action plan will also follow \na participatory approach. \n\n5\n\n10. \nKey  information  on  the  resettlement  and  community  development  plans,  including \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  options,  has  been  disseminated  to  affected  communities \nthrough  a  resettlement  information  brochure,  in  Lao,  language  in  accessible  places.  The  plans \nhave been uploaded on ADB\u2019s website.   \n\nG. \n\nInstitutional  Arrangements  and  Monitoring  of  Implementation  and  Impacts  of \nResettlement Plans \n\n11. \nThe  Social  and  Environment  Division  (SED)  of  DOR\u2019s  Planning  and  Technical  Division \nwill  provide  overall  guidance  and  technical  support  to  the  provincial  and  district  resettlement \ncommittees.  SED  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project  and  through  other  ADB  technical \nassistance  (TA).   One  international  resettlement  specialist  will  provide  overall  guidance.  Three \ndomestic  resettlement  specialists  and  three  community  mobilizers  will  provide  full-time \nassistance during the resettlement planning and implementation phase. Provincial, district, and \nvillage resettlement committees will be established. Village resettlement committees will actively \nparticipate in design and implementation of the resettlement and community development plans. \n\n6\n\n12.  Mechanisms  for  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  will  be  identified  and  set  in  place \nthrough  the  resettlement  management  system.  This  will  consist  of  internal  monitoring  by  the \nEA\u2019s  SED,  together  with  resettlement  specialists  from  the  construction  supervision  consultant. \nThe  construction  supervision  consultants  will  also  monitor  poverty  reduction,  including  in  all \nseverely affected households in their target groups.   \n\nH. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n13. \nThe  cost  of  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  five  resettlement  and  community \ndevelopment  plans  is  estimated  at  $200,000.  All  costs  will  be  updated  after  completion  of  the \ncensus,  detailed  measurement  survey,  and  application  of  final  compensation  rates.  The \ncompensation  rates  are  to  be  updated  to  ensure  they  are  equivalent  to  replacement  cost  at \ncurrent market value at the time of compensation. \n                                                \n5  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n6  Before  project  implementation,  the  social  safeguard  and  environmental  management  capacity  of  SED  will  be \n\nstrengthened through ADB TA 3557 and Loan 1989: Northern Economic Corridor Project. \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 7\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n ($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nProject Cost \nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\nFinancing Source \n\nLAO \n\nADB  NDF OPEC\n\nA.

Supplementary Appendix D \n\n1. \ndocuments the underlying analysis, with fully specified data and assumptions. \n\n2. \nThe benefit and cost analysis of the proposed Roads for Rural Development Project was \nprepared using on the road economic decision (RED)1 model, which was adjusted for conditions \nin the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR). The economic evaluation was made by \ncomparing the \u201cwith\u201d and the \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. The analysis is based on the direct benefits \narising  from  savings  in  transport  and  road  maintenance  costs  due  to  the  Project.  The  Project \nwas evaluated through to 2027, allowing a 3-year construction period starting in 2005, followed \nby a benefit period of 20 years. The analysis incorporates future routine, recurrent, and periodic \nmaintenance costs of the project roads. \n\nB. \n\nCurrent and Forecast Traffic Volumes  \n\n3. \nCurrent  traffic  volumes  were  determined  from  classified  traffic  counts  on  each  of  the \nmotorable project roads. Each traffic count was carried out for 12 hours on 3 consecutive days in \nNovember  2002.  Normal  traffic  growth  was  estimated  using  the  growth  rates  that  had  been \nadopted  in  an  earlier  study  of  the  project  roads,  with  no  differentiation  among  vehicle  types  or \nregions of the country. The rates used were 10% per year for the first half of the 20-year benefit \nperiod, and 8% per year afterward. These values are commensurate with recently experienced \ngrowth in road traffic and in vehicle registrations in the Lao PDR, and with the projected growth \nof  population  and  gross  domestic  product.  Divertible  traffic  was  identified  in  two  places:  (i)  on \nroad  section  1.01  (Sayabury\u2013Ban  Natak);  and  (ii)  on  road  section  6.02  (Houayla\u2013Ban  Vang). \nGenerated  traffic  was  estimated  for  each  road  section  and  vehicle  type  by  applying  a  price-\nelasticity  of  0.5  to  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC)  estimated  by  RED.  Suppressed \ntraffic  was  estimated  for  two  cases:  road  sections  that  are  inaccessible  for  motorized  traffic \nthroughout the year (Xaisetha\u2013Ban Paam and Ban Paam\u2013Sanxai), and (ii) road sections that are \nseasonally inaccessible for vehicles. On roads that are inaccessible for motor traffic throughout \nthe year, suppressed traffic was estimated by a simple gravitation model using 1991 data from \nthe National Transport Study (NTS), which is the latest comprehensive analysis available. NTS \ndata  were  updated  to  present  traffic  levels.  For  seasonally  impassible  roads,  daily  suppressed \ntraffic during the wet season was estimated at the average annul daily traffic (AADT) when the \nroad is accessible. \n\nC. \n\nConstruction Standards and Project Costs \n\nBased  on  results  of  engineering  analyses  of  two  or  three  construction  alternatives  for \n4. \neach  road  section,  an  economic  assessment  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  preferred \nconstruction standard for each road section. The cost of civil works was verified on the basis of \ncontracts awarded to improve Road 9, and other recent contracts for similar road works in the \nLao  PDR.  Investment  costs  include  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  road \nand bridge construction, engineering supervision, project management, social and environmental \n\n                                                \n1  The Roads Economic Decision (RED) Model is an implementation of the Highway Design and Maintenance Model \n(HDM-3)  in  Excel  spreadsheet  format.  RED  was  developed  under  the  African  Road  Management  Initiative  with \nsupport from the World Bank, which also maintains the model. The purpose was to provide a tool for evaluation of \nlow-traffic roads, such as those considered in this project. \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nmitigation,  and  the  clearance  of  unexploded  ordnance.  Financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic border prices. \n\nD. \n\nCosts, Benefits, and Distribution Effects \n\n5.       The traffic-related benefit streams are estimated as follows: (i) normal traffic benefits are \ncalculated  by  applying  the  difference  between  the  road  user  cost  in  the  \u201cwith\u201d  case  and  the \n\u201cwithout\u201d  case  to  the  forecast  \u2018normal\u2019  traffic;  (ii)  diverted  traffic  benefits  are  calculated  by \napplying the difference in cost of traveling on the old route and the new shorter route to forecast \n\u2018diverted\u2019 traffic; (iii) benefits from generated traffic are calculated by applying half the savings in \nroad user cost for normal traffic to forecast \u2018generated\u2019 traffic; and (iv) suppressed traffic benefits \nare calculated by applying half the difference between the potential user benefits when the road \nis accessible and inaccessible to forecast \u2018suppressed\u2019 traffic. Suppressed traffic benefits arise \nwhen a road, which is not open to motorized traffic either permanently or seasonally, is improved \nto  year-round  access.  Benefits  from  normal,  diverted,  and  generated  traffic  arise  with \nimprovement  of  a  road  that  is  already  accessible  year-round.  The  two  benefit  streams  are \nmutually exclusive. That is handled by apportioning the two benefit streams in accordance with \nthe  extent  of  inaccessibility  in  time.  Road  user  costs  were  estimated  using  RED\u2019s  VOC \nestimation module,2 and are based on collected information on the cost of relevant cost items. \n\nThe  economic  evaluation  discounts  the  stream  of  benefits  and  costs  over  a  23-year \n6. \nevaluation  period  from  2004  until  20  years  after  completion  of  road  works.  As  a  result  of  the \nanalysis, one road under review (Hongsa-Ngeun) was excluded as not economically viable. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the viable project is 17.1%. The Project generates a \npoverty impact ratio (PIR) of 0.82, reflecting the combined impact of two factors: (i) the Project \nentails a substantial net transfer of resources from the economy at large to the project area, and \n(ii) the incidence of poverty in the project area is more than twice the national average. \n\nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n7. \nSensitivity of the EIRR of the proposed project roads has been analyzed with respect to \nchanges in the following benefit and cost streams: (i) completion delayed by 2 years,3 (ii) 20% \nincreased  construction  costs,  (iii)  20%4  reduced  road  user  benefits,  (iv)  2%  reduced  traffic \ngrowth  rates,  and  (v)  the  benefit  period  reduced  to  8  years  because  of  insufficient  or  no  road \nmaintenance5 (Table A11). The tests reflect identified project risks. \n\nInsufficient road maintenance has the greatest impact, reducing the EIRR of the Project \n8. \nto  8.8%,  thus  rendering  the  proposed  project  unviable.  Only  two  components,  roads  5  and  6, \nremain  viable.  When  benefits  are  lost  due  to:  (i) delayed  completion  by  2  years,  (ii) lower  than \nforeseen future traffic growth, and (iii) lower than foreseen VOC savings, this reduces the EIRR \nby  3.8%,  3.3%,  and  2.7%  respectively.  Overall,  the  proposed  project  remains  viable  in  these \n\n                                                \n2   RED uses the HDM-3 estimation methodology without modification. \n3   The value reflects recent ADB experiences in neighboring Viet Nam, where the average loan extension in 2002 was \n23  months  (Source:  ADB.  2003.  Annual  Report  on  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Portfolio  Performance  for  the \nPeriod Ending 31 December 2002. Manila.). Similar delays have been experienced in the Lao PDR, due typically to \nlate or inadequate resettlement (which delays the start of construction) and poor contractor progress. Both risks are \nidentified in the project framework. \n\n4   Reduced  user  benefits  arise  when  the  quality  of  road  work  is  inferior,  thus  increasing  VOC  after  rehabilitation. \n\nInferior performance and supervision of contractors is identified as a risk in the project framework. \n\n5   Insufficient road maintenance will lead to premature loss of the road and results in a reduction in benefit period from \nthe normal 20 years to, typically, 8\u201310 years. Insufficient road maintenance is identified as a significant risk in the \nproject framework. \n\n\fAppendix 11\n\n53\n\ncases, except for the Sayabury-Hongsa road component. Increased construction costs have the \nleast impact, reducing the EIRR by 2.3%. \n\nTable A11: Sensitivity Analysis of the Proposed Project \n(EIRR)\n\nSayabur\ny-\nHongsa \n\n12.0%\n\n10.1%\n\nParameter \n\nPakxane-\nBan Thasi \n\nXaisetha-\nSansai \n\nHongsa-\nThaxong \n\nPakton-\nBan Vang \n\nAll Viable \nRoads \n\nBase Case \nConstruction and maintenance \ncost +20% \nVehicle operating cost savings:  \u2013\n20%\nTraffic growth rate:  \n\u20132% Points \nProject completion delayed by 2 \nyears \nProject Roads are not maintained\n\n17.3%\n\n15.0%\n\n17.0%\n\n14.8%\n\n29.2%\n\n25.9%\n\n24.8%\n\n21.7%\n\n17.1%\n\n14.9%\n\n9.8%\n\n14.5%\n\n14.3%\n\n25.2%\n\n21.0%\n\n14.4%\n\n9.0%\n\n14.0%\n\n13.7%\n\n25.1%\n\n20.8%\n\n13.8%\n\n9.3%\n\n1.1%\n\n13.4%\n\n13.2%\n\n9.0%\n\n8.5%\n\n21.9%\n\n24.5%\n\n18.6%\n\n20.3%\n\n13.3%\n\n8.8%\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n\n  Source: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project.\n\n9. \nSwitching values for the sensitivity parameters have been estimated as: construction and \nmaintenance  costs,  54.8%  higher  than  expected;  realized  traffic  growth,  3.1%  lower  than \npredicted; VOC savings, 34.5% lower than predicted; and completion delayed by about 3 years. \nRisk  analysis,   which  measures  the  impact  of  simultaneous  variation  of  the  sensitivity \nparameters, shows 85% probability that the EIRR is at least 12%. \n\n6\n\n10. \nThe PIR has been similarly tested except that an additional variable was included:  the \ndegree of transfer of VOC savings from transport providers to the end users of road transport.7\nReduced  transfer  of  VOC  savings  to  transport  users  reduces  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nimpact.\n\nThe  analysis  shows  that  the  PIR  in  general  is  inversely  correlated  to  the  sensitivity \n11. \nparameters tested in the benefit-cost analysis. That reflects that total net benefits in these cases \nare reduced proportionally more than benefits received by the poor. The only exception is failure \nto  maintain  the  roads,  which  reduces  the  PIR  moderately,  from  0.82  to  0.77.  But  the  PIR  is \nsensitive to variations in the foreseen degree of transfer of benefits to end-users. The sensitivity \nanalysis shows that reducing the degree of transfer from 67% (of full transfer) to 50% reduces \nthe  PIR  to  0.65.  The  switching  value  where  the  PIR  falls  below  0.50  is  35.3%  of  full  benefit \ntransfer. The risk analysis shows 81% probability that the PIR is at least 0.50. \n\n                                                \n6  The sensitivity of the Project\u2019s EIRR and PIR to concurrent variations in forecasting assumptions is assessed using \nstochastic risk analysis with respect to variations in: (i) construction costs (95% confidence interval: +20% to -20%). \n(ii) VOC (95% confidence interval: +20% to -20%). (iii) Traffic growth rates (95% confidence interval: +2% to -2%). \n(iv) delay in construction (95% confidence interval: 0\u20134 years delay, 50% chance that the Project will be completed \non time) and (v) maintenance of the roads (20% risk that the roads are not maintained). The PIR was also tested \nagainst variation in the share of VOC benefits transferred to users (95% confidence interval: +30% to -30%). The \nresults are based on 5,000 random simulations. \n\n7  The  degree  of  transfer  affects  the  distribution  of  benefits,  but  not  the  level  of  net  benefits  and  is,  therefore,  not \n\nrelevant for the benefit-cost analysis. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY (SPRSS) FORM \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao PDR:\nThe poor in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR) are heavily burdened by lack of access to goods and \nlabor markets and social services. Access deprivation results in high transportation costs that reduce the mobility of \npeople and goods produced by the poor. Access deprivation also results in reduced or lack of access to consumer \ngoods, social services, information, and market and livelihood opportunities for labor, with consequent implications for \nincome and socioeconomic welfare. Poor households in areas with limited access are often unable to overcome the \ncost barriers of mobility. This results in high levels of subsistence, with high vulnerability to external shocks and food \nshortages.\n\nPoor rural access to the rest of the economy implies that overall economic growth has limited impact on the rural poor. \nThe result is increased inequalities between rural and urban areas. The Lao PDR achieved remarkable reductions in \npoverty during the 1990s, much of it resulting from economic growth. But remote and access-deprived provinces \nexperienced significant less poverty reduction, and poverty incidence even increased in some areas. For instance, \nBorikhamxay Province, which is part of the Project, experienced a 15% increase of poverty, while poverty in the \neconomy as a whole declined by more than 6%.          \n\nThe road sector plays a key role in improving accessibility in a land-locked economy such as the Lao PDR. Improved \naccessibility implies that mobility of people, goods, and services increase, and will affect prices. But the extent of \nincrease in mobility will largely depend on policies of transport services, including outreach and tariffs, and the demand \nand affordability of such services.   \n\nWhile road accessibility will inevitably improve access to social services, including health and education, by shortening \nthe time and cost of traveling, the provision of services will also become more cost-effective with improved accessibility. \nTherefore, while impacts of improved accessibility will take place, the extent of impacts will depend on government \npolicies and the ability of the Government to provide these services. Data also suggest that all-weather village \naccessibility determines overall welfare and poverty at the village level. On the national level, per capita expenditures \nwere found to be 46% higher for villages with all-weather access vs those with no access, and 21% higher than in \nvillages that have only dry season access.    \n\nRoad access is a key underlying condition for poverty reduction in the Lao PDR, both in terms of ability and cost \neffectiveness of targeting services to the poor, and in poverty reduction benefits that result from economic growth. Most \nof the poor live in rural areas with limited access. Improved road access will remove cost barriers in the provision of \nsocial services and enhance the ability of the poor to benefit from overall economic growth. Thus, the impacts of \nimproved accessibility on poverty reduction can be both direct and indirect, with multisectoral implications, especially \nwith respect to education and health.   \n\nIncreased road access also integrates the project areas into the larger context of the economy. Integration promotes \neconomic growth for the overall economy by allowing those areas to contribute to the economy, and vice versa. \nIntegration also enables the population to better benefit from economic growth.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nMethodology \n\n \n \n\nPoverty Classification: \nCore Poverty Intervention \n\nA detailed socioeconomic and poverty study was carried out for the three first subprojects, a summary is in Table \nA12.1. A rapid rural assessment was conducted for the remaining two subprojects. The poverty profile is based on the \nlatest available poverty data, for 2003, at the district level from the National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP) and \nthe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 (LECS2) carried out in 1997\u201398. Because poverty may vary within a \ndistrict, field surveys were carried out areas within the subproject zones of influence (ZOIs). A ZOI was defined as \nvillages within a radius of 12 km that are accessible from the road subproject. \n\n\fAppendix 12\n\n55\n\nTable A12.1:  Poverty Profile  \n(%, based on head count) \n\nSubproject \n\nProvincial Poverty \nIncidence  \n\nDistrict Poverty \nIncidence  \n\nPakxane-Ban Thasi \n\nBorikhamxay \n\n25.8\n\nPoor as a Share of \nServed Populationa\n81.8\n\nSayabury-Hongsa \n\nSayabury \n\nXaisetha-Sanxai \n\nAttapeu\n\nHongsa-Thaxoang \nPakton-Ban Vang \n\nSayabury \nVientiane \nProvince \nVientiane \nMunicipality \n\nPakxane \nBorikhan \nSayabury \nHongsa \nXaisetha \nSanxai \nHongsa \nXanakham \n\n21.2 \n\n45.3\n\n21.2\n24.3\n\n12.2\n\nSangthong \n\n7.3\n73.0\n31.9\n44.6\n63.4\n96.8\n44.6\n41.1\n\n73.0\n\n43.9\n\n86.8\n\n51.6\n51.7\n\na Weighted average of population Zone of Influence. \nSources:  Laos  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  2  (1997\u201398);  data  from  a  2003  survey  for  the  National  Poverty \nEradication Program; and Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project. \n\nProject Weighted Average \n\n60.4\n\nThe poverty impact assessment was carried out by examining differences between good road access and poor access \nalong the subproject roads.

These indicators, together with the \npoverty profiles, give a fairly good indication of the magnitude of impacts and the channels through which impacts may \ntake place. The directions of expected impacts are presented on a poverty impact matrix in Supplementary Appendix E. \nThe impact assessment identified risks that may reduce the full potential for poverty reduction that would otherwise be \nexpected. The impact assessment focused on the change in terms of trade between input and output prices that occurs \nas a result of providing all-weather access to villages, the inflow and outflow of \u201cnew\u201d goods that would not be available, \nor would be of limited availability, in a poor access situation, and on the change in the availability of transport services \nand on tariff reduction as a result of reduced costs for transport service providers. The key risk to achieving the full \npotential for poverty reduction was identified as affordability of transport services by the poor.     \n\nThe poverty classification of the project was based on the overall population weighted head count poverty profile of \nproject beneficiaries in the ZOI of the sub-projects. That profile shows that 60.4% of the population in the subproject \nZOIs are poor\u2014the basis for the Project's classification as core poverty invention. The classification is confirmed by the \npoverty impact ratio (PIR) calculation, which indicates that the poor will receive 82% of all project benefits. The PIR \nassessment was done on a subproject basis, and for the project as a whole. The distributional analysis of net project \nbenefits and PIR is reported in Appendix 11, and described further in Supplementary Appendix D. The poverty impact \nmatrix containing poverty impacts and assumptions is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile \n\nPoverty incidence varies widely within provinces in the Lao PDR. Poverty in the project provinces varies largely with \naccessibility to provincial towns, social services, and markets. Poverty in villages along the subproject roads also differs \nmarkedly with accessibility. The overall share of poor beneficiaries in the direct project area ZOI is estimated at \n60.4%\u2014 substantially higher than the national poverty incidence of 38.6%.  \n\nThe ethnic and gender composition of the population within the ZOI is in Table A12.2. About 45% of the project \nbeneficiaries belong to groups that have assimilated traditional Lao cultural and social customs. Fewer than 1% practice \ntraditional indigenous customs. Of the beneficiaries, 80% are Buddhist, 15% are animist, and 5% are Christian. About \n30% of the poor are ethnic minorities. The gender profile is about 50-50, but the rate of female-headed poor households \nis low\u2014only 1%. The population is young, with more than 60% younger than age 25. The dependency ratio for poor \nhouseholds is 1.16 vs for less-poor households. \n\nMost villages within the subprojects\u2019 ZOI lack all-weather access to medical health care facilities. This can be \ndevastating because the most common diseases (malaria, diarrhea, fever, and influenza) occur during the rainy \nseason, when road access is limited. Adult literacy is generally low for both men (54%) and women (50%), with \nsignificant differences between poor and non-poor households. Most villages have primary schools, but have limited \naccess to education beyond primary education.     \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.2: Socioeconomic Profile \n\nSubproject \n\nPakxane-Ban \n\nThasi \nSayabury-\nHongsa\nXaisetha-\nSanxai \nHongsa-\n\nThaxoang \nPakton-Ban \nVang\n\nEthnic Minority  \n(%)\nLao \nTheung \n18.0\n\nLao \nSoung\n28.0\n\nLao \nLoum\n55.0\n\nWomen \n(%)\n\nFemale-\nHeaded \nHouseholds\n(%)\n\nAccess to Social Services along \nthe Roada\nPrimary \nSchool \n1\n\nHealth \nFacility \n2\n\nSecondary \nSchool \n\n2\n\n48.5\n\n31.0\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n50.0\n\n69.0\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n12.0\n\n0.0\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n48.2\n\n50.2\n\n50.8\n\n48.4\n\n50.3\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.7\n\nn.a.\n\nn.a.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\na 1 = all-weather access, 2 = access during dry season,  for most villages in the Zone of Influence. \nn.a. = data not available \nSource: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project. \n\nAbout two-thirds of the households market produce such as vegetables, livestock, non-timber forest products, and \nhandicrafts. The remaining third are subsistence households. The level of marketing depends on household \nsocioeconomic conditions, including land holdings, ability to afford marketing and transport services, and availability of \ntransport services. Only 13% of the poor market produce vs 36% of better-off households. The poor tend to market in \nthe local village or sell to traders because of high transportation costs. The better-off households market directly to \ndistrict primary and provincial tertiary markets. Welfare at the village level is directly related to the level of marketing of\ngoods. Villages with limited access tend to have higher subsistence and poverty levels.   \n\nMarketing of agricultural produce is a determinant of subsistence and vulnerability to food deficits for households. Poor \nhouseholds tend to have rice deficits from 2 to 6 months per year, with an average deficiency of about 41 kg per \ncapita/year, while better-off households have surpluses of rice to market. Poor households suffer from a vicious circle \nbecause of poor access, poor availability, and high cost of transport services. First, the poor must overcome food \nshortages at higher prices in the local village markets. Second, inputs to promote agricultural productivity are either not \navailable or available only at high prices, which discourages measures to enhance productivity.  \n\nPoverty and Development Impact \n\nImproving access will reduce vulnerability to food shortages by facilitating the flow of goods from surplus to deficit \nareas. Road access is critically important for villages and districts to cope with rice deficits. Table A12.3 shows the \npotential for reducing rice deficits along three project roads that would link rice-deficit areas with surplus areas. Poor \nroad access is closely linked with rice deficits, higher poverty levels, and higher food prices for consumers, especially \nfor the poor. At the same time, poor producers receive lower prices for their produce in areas with poor access. This \nrelative price distortion is due to high transactions costs for areas in relative isolation. High transaction costs are \ndetermined by transportation costs and monopoly traders. Because the poor market through traders, they are especially \naffected by the poor road access. Thus, the subprojects would be expected to have significant impact on the ability of \npoor villages to cope with rice and food shortages, and reduce the cost of coping strategies.     \n\nWith improved roads, transportation costs will be reduced. Price data for poor and good roads suggest that poor \nconsumers will benefit through lower consumer prices and poor producers will benefit through higher producer prices. \nBut the extent to which the poor will benefit will depend on the availability and competition among transport providers \nand traders. Other factors that may influence the relative price change may include education and ethnicity, because \nthese factors may influence the bargaining powers of the end consumer and producers. With increased competition \namong traders, however, the influence of cultural factors on bargaining power tends to decrease.  \n\nPoor road access is strongly correlated with lower education levels and low access to health facilities and services. All-\nweather access means that the village population would be able to travel to district centers for health care year-round. \nFurthermore, health care and education services tend to expand and improve as villages become accessible.  This \nwould be expected to improve welfare and reduce treatment costs, especially for the poor since they are more \nvulnerable to diseases and to the cost of transportation to medical facilities. \n\n\fAppendix 12\n\n57\n\nDistrict/Province \n\nSurplus/Deficit \n\nTable A12.3: Rice Production \n\n(tons per capita) \n\nSayabury \nKhop\nHongsa \nXianghon \n  Sayabury Province \nPakxane \nBorikhan \n  Borikhamxay Province \nXaisetha \nSanxai \n  Attapeu Province \n\n(tons)\n(5,790)\n19\n787\n2,307\n(23,542) \n23,674 \n(1,452)\n9,258\n2,085\n(3,428)\n6,712\n\n(0.085)\n0.001\n0.027\n0.078\n(0.070)\n1.235\n(0.050)\n0.054\n0.063\n(0.500)\n0.067\n\n  Source: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project. \n\nImproved access will lead to improved access to labor markets and employment opportunities. This will allow \nhouseholds to diversify risk away from agricultural and subsistence dependence. Access to labor markets is particularly \nimportant for the poor, because labor is their most important asset. Better access would inevitably lead to labor \nmigration and increased remittances from outside the villages. Remittances are important for households to cope with \nfood shortages and avoid poverty. An additional impact of improved road access is the impact on land prices. The \nextent that the poor can benefit from increased land prices depends on their ex ante price affordability of landholdings. \nIf land tenure is insecure, or if the poor are landless, the price effect may impact negatively on the poor. The poor have \nsignificantly less landholding than the non-poor, so the poor are expected to, at best, benefit from an increase in land \nprices, but less than the non-poor.    \n\nAffordability of Transportation \n\nThe ability of the poor to meet capital costs of ownership of transportation vehicles is restricted by limited cash income. \nSome poor own bicycles suitable for shorter trips, but no ownership of motorized transport by poor was found in the \nproject areas. Buses and pickup van services are provided by private transport operators along the project roads. Tuk-\ntuk1 services exist mainly in district and semiurban centers. On the supply side, the availability and cost of these \nservices differ significantly between areas with \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d road access. For many areas, transport services are \ninfrequent, and limited to the dry season. Two key factors determine the frequency of transport: demand: income; and \ncost to providers. But transport services are also heavily regulated by the transport associations, who determine the \nroutes and frequency of services; and by local provincial authorities, who set tariffs.  On the demand side, travel \nfrequency and distance for end consumers are determined by their socioeconomic conditions and by tariffs. Table \nA12.4 has tariff impact analyses for the three subprojects. After the road improvement, tariffs assume that the resulting \ncost savings are passed on to end consumers. Table A12.4 suggests that tariffs are closely related to accessibility. The \nexisting situation implies a 48% difference in tariffs between rainy and dry seasons. This difference is expected to \nvanish, making rainy season access significantly more affordable. The forecast impact is a 67% reduction in tariffs \nduring the rainy season, and a 50% reduction in the dry season. The expected tariff reductions will result in significantly \nincreased affordability and induced demand because of increased accessibility and incomes, even for the poor. But the \nextent of the tariff reduction and consequent price reductions for local consumers and producers will depend on \ncompetition among transport service operators and traders, and on regulations. The extent of this impact is not known, \nbut will be monitored.   \n\nTable 12.4: Expected Tariff Changes\n\nRoad\n\nAverage Tariff  \n(kip/km)\n\nExisting \n\n Pakxane-Ban Thasi \n\nSayabury-Hongsa \n Xaisetha-Sanxai \n\nRainy \n320\n\n1,087\n333\n\nDry \n200\n\n537\nn.a.\n\nAfter \nImprovement \n185\n\n182\n200\n\nn.a. not available \nSource: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project. \n\n                                                \n1 Locally constructed small taxis based on extended motorcycles \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nRoad Safety and Poverty\n\nImproved roads are often a mixed blessing for the poor. Although road access is critically important for access to health\ncare, the increased traffic volume resulting from road improvement also means increased need for health care\u2014\nbecause of injuries from traffic accidents. These adverse impacts tend to disproportionately impact on the poor. The\npoor are affected directly, as the most vulnerable vehicle and road users, and indirectly, in terms of health service \nneeds that traffic injuries impose, but that cannot be met, and in terms of the impact on gross domestic product (GDP). \nThe impact of a traffic injury on a member of a poor household can be devastating in terms of health costs and loss of \nincome and livelihood activities. Within poor families, the main providers and children going to school often face a \nhigher probability of traffic injury than other family members, because they use roads more. Poor traffic safety\nmeasures protecting the poor means lost opportunities for poverty reduction. Little has been done to examine the \nimpact of road safety issues on poverty, so a study will be conducted, as part of capacity building, to specifically\naddress the vulnerability of the poor to traffic accidents, and to examine the social and economic costs of poor traffic \nsafety to the poor. The project also includes specific measures to address road safety issues along the project roads. \n\nC.  Participation Process\n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?\nAnalysis has been prepared in terms of project beneficiaries. This is presented in the Poverty Profile above, and in the\nbenefit distribution analysis under the economic analysis in Appendix 11.\n\n  Yes \n\n   No\n\nIs there a participation strategy?\nA community education campaign will be prepared and implemented to consolidate all project activities of information,\nconsultation, participation, and education and awareness activities. Community mobilizers will facilitate the participation\nof project communities. A road safety awareness program, targeted at villagers living along the roads, will be prepared\nand implemented under the Project. The program includes stakeholders from different central government departments,\nlocal authorities, and villages.\n\n   Yes\n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development\n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:\nThe gender profile is about 50: 50, but the rate of female-headed households is low; about 1% of poor households are\nheaded by females. The construction phase of the Project will bring an influx of temporary laborers with impacts on \nexisting communities, including increased demand for commercial sex workers, and introduction of new ideas, as well\nas employment and business opportunities. Better roads facilitate movement from communities that offer few\nemployment or livelihood options. This can be a positive gain, if the migration process is safe. But such migration often\nends in exploitive circumstances in the hands of human traffickers. The worst forms of trafficking in the region is the \nillegal movement of women and children for exploitation in sectors such as commercial sex and child labor of all forms.\nThe low status of women increases their vulnerability as targets of traffickers, and limits their options as survivors\nseeking a new life. Efforts to increase awareness of the dangers of trafficking, and provision of safe migration services,\nwill help prevent negative outcomes from increased mobility from areas with improved roads.\n\nWomen and girls, particularly in the poorest ethnic minority communities, need improved literacy, numeracy, Lao\nlanguage fluency, and market skills to benefit from the development potential brought by the road improvements. Also, \nemployment in the formal sector builds status and confidence of young women, who can then better resist the coercion \nand deception of traffickers. The increased risk of HIV/AIDS2 will be mitigated through an awareness and prevention\nprogram. The nonformal education program for the Xaisetha-Sanxai roads, the Sayabury-Hongsa roads, and the \nPakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads, if required and initiated, will specifically target women and girls. \nVulnerable women heads of households will be provided special assistance during implementation of the resettlement\nplan. A gender strategy has been prepared for the Project to address the risks of increased HIV/AIDs and trafficking, \nand to enhance women\u2019s abilities to benefit from the development potential brought by the road improvements.

A resettlement \nframework has been prepared for the Pakton-Ban Vang and\nHongsa-Thaxoan roads.\n\nAffordability will increase because improved access will enhance\ncash income and employment opportunities. Information suggests\nthat availability of transport services and traders will increase as a \nresult of road improvement, and that tariffs will be reduced by as \nmuch as 67%. But the extent of tariff reductions for transport\nservices will depend on competition among transport service\noperators. Tariffs will be closely monitored as part of the project\nperformance monitoring system.\nEnhanced access is expected to induce labor migration. The\nimpact will be mainly positive for households.\n\nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People was initiated because 75% of \nthe populations along the Xaisetha-Sanxai and Sayabury-Hongsa\nroads belong to ethnic minorities who may be vulnerable to\nchanges that the road improvements cause. Because the \ncommunities are made up of both ethnic minority and majority\npeoples, a community development plan was prepared to meet\nthe requirements of an ethnic minority development plan for the\ntwo roads. The small number of ethnic minorities along the \nPakxane-Thasi road will not be disproportionately vulnerable\nbecause of their ethnicity and cultures, and therefore, do not\ntrigger the ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy. A resettlement and \ncommunity development framework has been prepared for the \nPakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads.\nRoad Safety: A study of impacts of road safety on the poor, plus a \nroad safety program, including village awareness and training\nprograms, will be implemented. Fencing is included in the\nresettlement plan.\n\nHIV/AIDS and SDT: An HIV/AIDS and STD awareness and\nprevention program is needed to mitigate risks from the influx of\nconstruction workers and increased mobility as a result of road \nimprovements. Issues identified and strategies are being\nprepared. Detailed designs are to be done in conjunction with\nimplementation.\n\nTrafficking of Women and Children: A program for awareness\nand prevention of trafficking, and promotion of safe migration, is \nplanned to prevent negative outcomes from increased mobility\nfrom areas with improved roads.\n\nLand Tenure: Households along the project roads need land titles \nin the names of both husband and wife for tenure security, and\nawareness of their rights. Issues identified and strategies to \naddress them are being prepared. Detailed designs will be \ninitiated in conjunction with implementation.\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,\nSTD = Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 May 2004) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "kip (KN) \n", "\u2013\n", "=\n=\n", "KN1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0001\nKN10,468\n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "AADT\nADB\nADF\nAP\nASEAN\nAusAid\nCEMP\nDCPTC\n", "DMS\nDOL\nDOR\nEA\nEIRR\nEMP\nHIV/AIDS\n", "HTMP\nIEE\nKPI\nLao PDR \nLCB\nLECS\nLSRSP\nMCTPC\nMOF\nNDF\nNGO\nNPEP\nNTFP\nOPEC Fund \nPIR\nPPMS\nPPTA\nPRC\nRED\nRMF\nRMP\nRP\nSED\nSida\nSIEE\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "average annual daily traffic \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \naffected person \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nConstruction Environmental Management Plan \nProvincial Departments of Communications, Transport, Post, \nand Construction \ndetailed measurement survey \nDepartment of Lands \nDepartment of Roads \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return  \nEnvironmental Management Plan \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome\nHeavy Transport Management Program \ninitial environmental examination \nkey performance indicator \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nlocal competitive bidding \nLaos Expenditure and Consumption Survey \nLao Swedish Road Sector Project \nMinistry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction \nMinistry of Finance \nNordic Development Fund \nnongovernment organization \nNational Poverty Eradication Program \nnon timber forest products \nOPEC Fund for International Development \npoverty impact ratio \nproject performance management system \nProject Preparation Technical Assistance \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nRoads Economic Decision Model \nRoad Maintenance Fund \nRoad Maintenance Project \nResettlement Plant \nSocial and Environmental Division \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency \nsummary initial environmental examination \n", "SPRSS\nSTD\nTA\nUXO \nZOI\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nsexually transmitted disease \ntechnical assistance \nunexploded ordinance \nzone of influence \n", "NOTE\n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
