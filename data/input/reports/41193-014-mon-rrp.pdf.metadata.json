Due to the large land area, \nlow  population  density,  and  severe  weather  conditions  during  winter,  surface  transportation  in \nMongolia  is  difficult.  Paved  roads  account  for  just  over  5%  of  the  total  road  network  with  the \nmajority of roads only dirt tracks. The route of the proposed western regional road corridor, which \nis  part  of  Asian  Highway  4  and  is  designated  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC)  Corridor  4a,  runs  north\u2013south  from  Mongolia\u2019s  border  with  the  Russian  Federation  at \nUlaanbayshint to its border with the PRC at Yarant, a total distance of about 743 kilometers (km). \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  development  of  111 km  of  the  corridor \nthrough the Western Regional Road Corridor Development Project\u2013Phase I (phase I).3\n The PRC \nis financing 145 km of the corridor, while the Government of Mongolia is developing 194 km. The \nremaining 293 km of road is proposed to be developed under the investment program. \n \nMongolia\u2019s  western  region  suffers  from  slow  development  because  of  its  remoteness \n4. \nfrom the country\u2019s political and economic centers and its inadequate transport network. Roads \nto  and  within  the  region  are  mostly  unpaved  and  impose  heavy  travel  costs  on  residents  and \nvisitors. As a result, the region lacks adequate access to jobs, markets, and social services, and \nis  significantly  poorer  than  other  parts  of  Mongolia.  Gross  domestic  product  per  capita  in  the \nwestern  region  is  only  75%  of  the  national  average.  The  poverty  incidence  was  48%  in  2008, \ncompared with the national average of 34%. Due to their proximity to the PRC and the Russian \nFederation,  Bayan-Olgiy  and  Khovd  provinces  import  about  75%  of  their  energy,  food, \nconsumer goods, and construction materials from the two countries. \n \n5. \nLack of paved roads results in high transport costs and long travel times. The investment \nprogram is the government\u2019s top priority road investment after the ADB-financed Regional Road \nDevelopment Project.4\n A functioning paved road network will help Mongolia to  link together its \nlarge  and  poorly  connected  territory  to  promote  social  and  economic  development.  While  the \nwestern  region  is  sparsely  populated,  it  is  home  to  185,000  people,  who  currently  have  no \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

The regional road corridor runs \nnorth\u2013south from the border with the Russian Federation at Altanbulag, through the national capital Ulaanbaatar, to \nthe border with the PRC at Zamyn-Uud.  \n\n\fpaved road access to regional cities and towns. The investment program will provide a vital link \nto  economic  opportunities  and  social  services,  reduce  the  high  costs  of  imports,  and  improve \nthe competitiveness of the region\u2019s export products. \n \nCross-border  transport.  Mongolia\u2019s western  regional road  corridor can also serve  as a \n6. \ndirect and convenient transit route between the Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous  Region of the PRC \nand  the  Russian  Federation,  reducing  transport  costs  and  facilitating  trade,  tourism,  and  other \neconomic  activities.  Rising  incomes  will  increase  the  demand  for  imports  from  neighboring \ncountries, which are now constrained due to extremely high transport costs. Efficient cross-border \ntransport will be essential for the western regional road to deliver the envisioned benefits. ADB is \nassisting  the  PRC  to  improve  cross-border  transport  in  the  region  through  the  Xinjiang  Altay \nUrban  Infrastructure  and  Environment  Improvement  Project, 6\n which  includes  infrastructure \nimprovements at the Takeshiken land port on the PRC side of the border near Yarant. \n \n7. \nTrade  and  regional  transport  is  hindered  by  the  lack  of  cross-border  transport \nagreements.  Mongolia  has  an  existing  cross-border  transport  agreement  with  the  Russian \nFederation  allowing  reciprocal  access  to  each  country\u2019s  vehicles.  In  practice,  Russian  trucks \nrarely  travel  south  of  Olgiy  due  to  the  poor  road  conditions.  On  the  PRC  side,  Mongolian \nvehicles generally cannot travel past Takeshiken, near the border, and vehicles from the PRC \ncan  only  travel  to  designated  locations  in  Mongolia;  usually  to  deliver  materials  for  road \nconstruction.  No  trilateral  transit  system  covers  movements  between  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and \nthe Russian Federation. Given the importance of transit agreements to Mongolia, a component \non  a  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan  was  included  under  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment  Project,  which  is  now  under  implementation  (footnote  4).  Further  support  for \ntransport and trade facilitation is being provided through regional TA.7\n \n \n8. \nLessons  from  prior  road  projects. Road projects in Mongolia have experienced cost \noverruns  and  delays  in  implementation.  Cost  overruns  were  primarily  the  result  of  large \nworldwide commodity price increases during 2007\u20132008, and the lack of recent bid prices upon \nwhich  to  base  road  construction  cost  estimates.  The  Regional  Road  Development  Project \nrequired  supplementary  financing  in  2008  to  cover  cost  overruns. 8\n The  phase  I  project  has \nlikewise  experienced  cost  increases  for  which  the  government  has  requested  additional \nfinancing  (para.  13).  ADB  has  taken  steps  to  prevent  cost  overruns  under  the  proposed \ninvestment program through extensive due diligence on the detailed design and cost estimates. \nAll  estimates  are  now  based  on  recent  bid  prices  from  the  phase  I  project.  In  addition,  the \nrevised cost estimates incorporate large contingencies to account for potential inflation impacts.  \n \n9. \nPast implementation delays were caused by problems with (i) preparing bid documents, \n(ii) evaluating  bids,  (iii)  preparing  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  (iv) preparing  acceptable \nwithdrawal  applications.  ADB  intends  to  address  the  implementation  problems  with  a  multi-\nfaceted  capacity  development  effort  that  will  provide  international  consultancy  support  to  the \ngovernment  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs).  This  will  directly  assist  with,  and  provide \non-the-job  training  in,  every  aspect  of  procurement,  project  management,  and  implementation \nfor the duration of the first tranche implementation period. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2011.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Supplementary \n\nLoan and Grant to Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fJustification for financing modality. The investment program represents an expansion \n10. \nof over 20% of the entire paved road network in Mongolia, which will require a medium- to long-\nterm commitment by ADB to assist the government in completing the road corridor. The cost of \ncompleting  the  remaining  sections  of  the  western  regional  road  is  estimated  at  $262 million, \nwhich  is  significantly  more  than  ADB  has  been  able  to  provide  under  a  single  loan  to  the \ntransport  sector  in  Mongolia.9 At  the  same  time,  the  full  benefits  of  the  road\u2014particularly  for \nlong-distance and transit traffic and to spur new economic development opportunities\u2014will only \nbe realized once the road corridor is complete. The MFF modality allows ADB to include the full \nscope of the road under the investment program and align its financing with the government\u2019s \nability to implement the investment program. The MFF will allow the government to proceed as \nquickly  as  its  expanding  access  to  ADB  and  other  resources 10\n and  implementation  progress \npermit. \n \n11. \nPolicy framework and road map. To play its part in the rapid expansion of Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport network, the road subsector needs capacity development and modernization. ADB has \nhad  extensive  dialogue  with  the  government  to  formulate  a  sector  road  map  and  capacity \ndevelopment  strategy. 11  This  road  map  establishes  medium-  and  long-term  performance \nobjectives  for  the  road  subsector  and  draws  up  a  series  of  targets  and  actions  to  be \nimplemented.  To  support  the  implementation  of  priority  reforms  and  build  capacity,  ADB  has \napproved capacity development TA to be implemented in parallel with the proposed MFF. 12\n The \nTA  will  assist  the  government  to  implement  the  initial  phase  of  the  road  map.  Road  map \nimplementation targets are incorporated as government undertakings for the MFF. \n \nStrategic  context.  The  investment  program  addresses  ADB\u2019s  strategic  goals 13 in  the \n12. \ntransport  sector  to  (i)  foster  regional  integration  by  reducing  transport  and  logistics  costs; \n(ii) improve  sector  institutions,  management,  human  capacity,  and  asset  sustainability;  and \n(iii) develop and improve regional and international transport corridors, including the completion \nof  corridor  4a  in  the  CAREC  transport  program.  The  investment  program  objectives  are  fully \nconsistent with the strategic goals articulated in the country partnership strategy.14\n \n \n13. \nInvestment  program.  The  physical  elements  of  the  investment  program  include \n(i) completing  the  western  regional  road,  which  has  long  been  part  of  Mongolia\u2019s  national \ndevelopment  strategy,  (ii)  linking  small  villages  and  towns  to  the  main  corridor  to  spread  the \nbenefits of the investment to regional population centers, and (iii) establishing road maintenance \ncenters  to  improve  asset  management  and  sustainability.  Nonphysical  components  include \ncapacity development in the road subsector, support for local contractors, extensive on-the-job \ntraining in project management and implementation, and sector reform initiatives adopted in the \nroad map and implemented through coordination and performance links between the MFF and \n\n                                                 \n9  The country operations business plan reports that transport sector lending is expected to average about $38 million \n\nper year during 2010\u20132012, representing nearly 60% of all ADB lending to Mongolia. \n\n10 Mongolia received ADB Board approval on 16 August 2011 to access ordinary capital resources under the ADB\u2019s \n\nGraduation Policy. \n\n11 ADB.  2010.

The  link  between  the  MFF  physical  investments  and  the  sector  road  map \nimplementation will provide strong incentives for sector development and reform. \n \n14. \nAdditional  financing. The phase I project now under implementation has experienced \ncost overruns as a result of price escalation, leaving one section of the road without sufficient \nfinancing. The government has requested additional financing for that section, through tranche 1 \nof the proposed MFF. The request meets ADB\u2019s requirements for additional financing15 through \nan  MFF. 16\n Therefore,  tranche  1  of  the  proposed  investment  program  includes  additional \nfinancing  to  complete  the  phase  I  project.  The  remaining  sections  of  the  phase  I  project  are \nproceeding satisfactorily. The road section receiving supplementary financing will be completed \nwithin 3 years of the grant closing date for phase I. The investment program remains consistent \nwith the phase I project\u2019s development objectives. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  inclusive  economic  growth  promoted  by \nenhanced  local  and  regional  connectivity  in  the  remote  western  region  of  Mongolia.  The \noutcome will be improved transport accessibility within the project area and between countries. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nProject  1.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  1  will  be  (i) 103.3  km  of  paved  road \nconstructed between Baga Ulaan Davaa and Mankhan, (ii) one maintenance center established \nand  equipped,  (iii)  20  km  of  local  access  road  constructed  between  district  centers  and  the \nwestern  regional  road,  and  (iv)  capacity  development  for  maintenance  planning,  and  works, \nprocurement, and project management. \n \n17. \nProject  2.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  2  are  expected  to  be  (i)  103.9  km  of \npaved  road  constructed  between  Khovd  provincial  center  and  Khashaatiin  Davaa,  (ii)  one \nmaintenance  center  established  and  equipped,  (iii)  two  bridges  and  10  km  of  local  road \nrehabilitated in Khovd provincial center, between the western regional road and the airport, and \n(iv) additional and ongoing support for capacity development and reform in the road subsector, \nwhich will be identified in the TA (footnote 12). \n \n18. \nProject  3. Outputs to be financed under project 3 are expected to be (i) 44 km of road \nbetween  Khashaatiin  Davaa  and  Buraatiin  Davaa,  16  km  of  paved  road  constructed  between \nBuraatiin Davaa and Tolbo District, and 25.8 km of paved road constructed between Tsaganuur \nand Ulaanbayshint; (ii) one maintenance unit established and equipped; (iii) one bridge and 4.9 \nkm of local road rehabilitated in Olgiy provincial center, linking to the western regional road; and \n(iv) additional and ongoing support for capacity development and reform in the road subsector, \nwhich will be finalized during the implementation of the work under project 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 As required under the Operations Manual section on additional financing, the project remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound. ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5. Manila.  \n16 The Operations Manual section on the multitranche financing facility states that limited supplementary financing of \npurely price or financing arrangement changes may be made available in respect of prior ADB interventions in the \nsame  sector.  ADB.  2010.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  Operations  Manual.  OM  D14/OP.  Manila.  The \nrequirements  for  limited  supplementary  financing  through  an  MFF  are  addressed  in  the  Additional  Financing \nAssessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nD. \n \n19. \nPrevious  externally  financed  road  construction  projects,  including  those  supported  by \nADB, have relied on foreign contractors for civil works, limiting the development of the local road \ncontracting  industry.  A  viable  local  road  contracting  industry  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the \ncountry has the capacity to maintain the existing and planned roads, as well as to support new \nconstruction.  The  MFF  provides  an  opportunity  to  raise  the  capacity  and  quality  of  local  road \ncontractors so that they can produce an increasing share of road construction work and play a \nleading role in the ongoing maintenance of Mongolia\u2019s road assets. This will also ensure greater \neconomic spinoffs for Mongolia as a result of the investments in road construction. \n \n20. \nThrough  the  MFF,  ADB  will  prioritize  the  development  of  the  local  road  contracting \nindustry in two ways: (i) civil works contracts will be packaged such that local contractors will be \nable  to  compete  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures;  and  (ii)  by  making  future \ntranches  under  the  MFF  contingent  on  the  government  providing  adequate  budgets  for  road \nmaintenance  and  upon  demonstrated  performance  of  maintenance  work,  ADB  will  promote  a \nmore steady and expanding stream of work for local contractors. The parallel TA will reinforce \nthese efforts by supporting the development and implementation of asset management systems \nand procedures, and by supporting human resource development, research, and training. \n \nE. \n \n21. \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $262  million  equivalent.

It \nis understood that the provision of any such additional ADF financing will be accompanied by a \ncorresponding  reduction  of  the  available  OCR  financing  (and  vice-versa),  so  that  the  total \nfinancing provided by ADB will not exceed the aggregate amount of $170 million equivalent. Any \nadditional ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF resources from time \nto time, (ii) Mongolia\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable Graduation \nPolicy, 21 and  the  requirements  of  ADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  such  resources  to \nMongolia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance-based allocation of ADF \nresources.22\n \n\n The financing plan is in \n\nTable 2\n\n. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nSource \nInvestment Program \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \n \nTranche 1 \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund) \nGovernment \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n170.00 \n92.00 \n262.00 \n \n45.00 \n27.85 \n72.85 \n\n  Share of Total (%) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n64.90 \n35.10 \n100.00 \n \n61.77 \n38.23 \n100.00 \n\n23. \nThe  investment  program  will  be  implemented  over  8  years.

The carriageway is 7 meters wide with 1.5 meter gravel \nshoulders. The existing road to be upgraded under project 1 is entirely made up of dirt tracks. \nThe investment program does not have any unusual technical risks. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe investment program is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate \nof  return  of  11.0%,  and  a  net  present  value  of  $19.5  million  at  a  10%  discount  rate.  The \ninvestment program will cut user transport costs and time by nearly 50%, ensure all-year access \nfor small vehicles, and reduce travel hazards. The investment program will foster local economic \ngrowth and increase cross-border trade. \n \nIt is ADB\u2019s practice to consider projects with an  economic internal rate of return above \n26. \n10%,  to  be  economically  justified  when  they  generate  significant  unquantified  economic \nbenefits. 24\n For  the  investment  program,  these  benefits  include  (i)  increased  accessibility  to \neducation and health facilities for rural herders; (ii) easier mitigation and relief of weather-related \nemergencies in rural areas; and (iii) scale economies, stronger competition, and agglomeration \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

The investment program \nwill also promote poverty relief and improved equity, as (i) it will improve the farm-gate value of \nthe  meat,  wool,  and  dairy  products  sold  by  poor  herders;  (ii)  it  will  create  low-skilled  job \nopportunities  during  construction  and \nin  an  area  of  chronic \nunderemployment;  and  (iii) it  will  enhance  gender  equity  by  creating  new  opportunities  for \nwomen herders to generate income, by reducing the time they spend going to market and taking \nchildren  to schools  or hospitals.  The  investment  program  will  also  help  redistribute  Mongolia\u2019s \neconomic activity toward its poorest rural areas and foster national integration.  \n \n27. \nADB  is  implementing  several  social  development  projects  in  western  Mongolia,  which \nwill complement the investment program and help to spread the benefits of the western regional \nroad to the poor. These include the Education for the Poor\u2014Financial Crisis Response Project; \nEarly  Childhood  Education  for  Rural,  Nomadic,  and  Migrant  Children;  and  the  Food  and \nNutrition, Social Welfare Program and Project.25\n \n \n28. \nThe  investment  program  will  not  earn  any  direct  revenue.

Project 1 has been classified under involuntary resettlement category C \n32. \nbecause no impact on any individual, household, assets, or livelihood has been identified. The \nresettlement framework has been prepared as a precautionary measure;28\n it has been endorsed \nby the Ministry of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (MRTCUD), and \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2011. Subsequent  projects are expected to be \nclassified under involuntary resettlement category C. \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Project  1  has  been  classified  under  indigenous  peoples \ncategory C  because  the  local  people  are  Mongols  and  are  not  vulnerable  on  the  basis  of \nethnicity. Subsequent projects may be classified under indigenous peoples category B because \nof  the  presence  of  Kazakhs  and  other  ethnic  groups.
