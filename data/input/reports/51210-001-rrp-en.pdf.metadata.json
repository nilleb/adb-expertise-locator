I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loan \nof up to $100,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent to Ostro Kutch Wind Private Limited (OKWPL), \nfor the Kutch Wind Project in India. \n \n2.  The 250 megawatts (MW) wind project is located at taluka Bhuj and Anjar, in the district \nof Kutch in the state of Gujarat. The project involves the installation of 125 V-110 Vestas turbines \nof 2 MW of wind capacity each. OKWPL has signed four power purchase agreements (PPAs) \nwith PTC India Limited (PTC) for the sale of 250 MW wind power produced by the project. \nFacilitating the delivery of the country\u2019s first wind auctioned project, the project demonstrates the \ncommercial viability of competitively bid wind projects and encourages long term private sector \nfinancing in this sector. The project will also help reduce the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels \nand promote renewable energy development. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n3.  In 2015, the Government of India set an ambitious target of achieving 175 gigawatts (GW) \nof renewable energy capacity by 2022\u2014100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, and 15 GW from \nother sources. In pursuit of that target, India added 11 GW of renewable energy capacity in \nFY2017, taking the total to 57 GW as of 31 March 2017. Of that total, wind contributed 5.4 GW \nand solar 5.6 GW.1 Historically, allocation of solar power projects in India has been through \nreverse bidding mechanism,2 which has resulted in the tariff falling to \u20b92.44 per kilowatt-hour in \n2017, from \u20b912.16 per unit in 2011. However, the allocation of wind power projects was made \nunder the feed-in tariff policy. In June 2016, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy launched \nthe country\u2019s first wind energy auction to set up 1,050 MW of wind power projects to be connected \nto the national grid and to be managed by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited that serves as \nthe central transmission utility (CTU). The auction aimed to procure the supply of wind power at \na  price  achieved  through  transparent  bidding  procedures  and  to  help  meet  the  nonsolar \nrenewable purchase obligations for states with poor wind resources.  \n \n4.  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy designated the Solar Energy Corporation of \nIndia (SECI) as the implementing agency for the auction. OKWPL won 250 MW of capacity under \nthe scheme and has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the debt financing of \nthe project. Ostro Energy Private Limited (OEPL), a renewable energy independent power \nproducer in India, currently owns 100% of the shares in OKWPL, the project company. As of July \n2017, OEPL has an operating wind power capacity of 648 MW spread across four states: Andhra \nPradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. http://mnre.gov.in; Government of India, Ministry of \nPower, Central Electricity Authority. http://cea.nic.in \n2  Reverse bidding is a mechanism where the upper tariff cap is set and projects are awarded to bidders quoting the \nlowest bid price. ", "2 \n2.   Project Design \n5.  The project is being developed on a build\u2013own\u2013operate basis and is required to be \ncommissioned within 18 months from the date of issue of the letter of award. SECI issued the \nletter of award on 5 April 2017. PTC is appointed as the intermediary to carry out the purchase \nand sale of wind power procured under the auction. OKWPL was selected as one of the winning \nbidders and has signed four PPAs on substantially the same terms for the sale of 250 MW, in \naggregate, at a fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per unit with PTC as the counterparty.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n6.  The government founded PTC in 1999 to promote power trading in India. Since then, PTC \nhas grown to be the largest player in the power trading market. PTC signs PPAs with power \nproject developers and, in turn, signs power sale agreements with  offtakers, acting as an \nintermediary  between  the  generators  and  consumers.  PTC  mitigates  counterparty  risk  by \ndiversifying its customer base across multiple states and through recourse to various payment \nsecurity mechanisms. In FY2017, PTC traded 48.32 billion units through both long-term and short-\nterm contracts and reported revenues of \u20b9140 billion with net profit of \u20b92.91 billion. As of 31 March \n2017, PTC had total assets worth \u20b966 billion and a net worth of \u20b930.7 billion on a stand-alone \nbasis. PTC has two subsidiaries, PTC Energy Ltd (PEL) and PTC India Financial Services Limited \n(PFS). PEL undertakes development of wind power projects and has a total operating capacity of \n288.8 MW. PFS is registered as a nonbank finance company with the Reserve Bank of India and \nprovides  financing  to  infrastructure  projects.  All  the  liabilities  of  PEL  and  PFS  are  on  a \nnonrecourse basis, and PTC does not have any ongoing obligations toward these two companies. \nPTC does not have any long-term credit rating. However, it has the highest short-term rating of \nA1+ by CRISIL. \n \n7.   For the proposed project, OKWPL has entered into a term sheet with the intention of \nentering  into  a  date-certain,  fixed-price  turnkey  engineering  procurement  and  construction \narrangement with Vestas Wind Technology India Private Limited (Vestas India), a leading supplier \nof wind turbines in India. The term sheet covers key elements of the engineering, procurement, \nand construction strategy arrangements, including land and site development, installation and \ncommissioning,  wind  turbine  supply,  and  power  evacuation.  Tractebel  Engineering  Private \nLimited is appointed as the lender\u2019s independent engineer (LIE) and 3Tier R&D India Private \nLimited is appointed as the lender\u2019s wind resource assessment advisor. The LIE has reviewed \nthe term sheet and has confirmed that the terms are satisfactory and in line with the industry \nnorms. According to the engineering, procurement, and construction term sheet, any failure to \ncommission the project as per timelines results in liquidated damages payable by Vestas India to \ncompensate OKWPL for damages, and are sized to include the penalty charged by SECI.   \n \n8.  Vestas India has significant experience in India, with over 3 GW of installed capacity in \nIndia alone. Vestas Wind Systems A/S (Vestas), which has 83 GW of installed capacity across \n75 different countries, owns Vestas India. Vestas is listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen exchange. \nIt has a market capitalization of DKr130.8 billion ($20.66 billion)3 as on 12 August 2017. In 2016, \nVestas reported annual revenues of \u20ac10.2 billion ($12.06 billion) and net profit of \u20ac965 million \n($1.1 billion). Vestas has \u20ac9.9 billion ($11.7 billion) in total assets for 2016. \n \n9.  The project is located at taluka Bhuj and Anjar, in the district of Kutch in the State of \nGujarat. The project involves installation of 125 V-110 Vestas turbines of 2 MW of wind capacity \n                                                \n3  Using an exchange rate of DKr1 = $0.16. ", "  3 \neach. The project will be connected to the CTU at Bachau substation via a 62-kilometer, 220-\nkilovolt transmission line. A total of 1 hectare of land is required for each wind turbine location. \nOKWPL has confirmed that all of the land for the wind turbines is government-owned revenue \nland, which will be leased and/or allotted to OKWPL. \n \n3.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) diversified energy mix in \nIndia by adding renewable energy capacity, helping the country reduce its dependence on fossil \nfuels; and (ii) the promotion of cost-competitive, convenient, safe, and reliable new and renewable \nenergy supply options, which can be achieved through greater private sector participation.  \n \n13.  Outcome. The project will help increase delivery of clean power sustainably produced by \nthe private sector. It will generate 762 GW-hours of clean energy per annum and help avoid \n669,036 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from 2020. \n \n14.   Outputs. The outputs will be (i) wind power production capacity increased by October \n2018, and (ii) growth of local economy supported. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project\u2019s development \nsupports infrastructure and environment, two of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas, as per its \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020.4 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018-2022 for India is \nbased on three developmental pillars: (i) boosting economic competitiveness to create more and \nbetter jobs, (ii) inclusive provision of infrastructure networks and services, and (iii) addressing \nclimate change and increasing climate resilience.5 This project paticularly supports pillar (iii). \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy,6 which prioritizes support for renewable energy development. In September \n2015,7 ADB announced that it would double its annual climate financings to $6 billion by 2020. Of \nthis $6 billion, $4 billion is for mitigation which includes scaling up support for renewable energy. \nThe project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s previous operations in the energy sector in Gujarat. In \n2013, ADB provided a $100 million loan to strengthen the transmission network in Gujarat.8  \n \n17.  Lessons from previous operations. The annual reviews of the previous renewable \nenergy projects in India financed by ADB emphasized the financial and execution strengths of the \nsponsor for the successful implementation of each project.

Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The key policies that govern renewable energy in India are (i) the Electricity Act 2003, \nwhich establishes the overall framework for the power sector; (ii) the National \nElectricity Policy of 2005, a requirement under the Electricity Act that directs the \ncentral government to establish a guideline for power development, in consultation \nwith key stakeholders; and (iii) the Tariff Policy 2006, which prescribes key rates, \nratios, and other factors to ensure the viability and efficiency of power projects. Key \nstakeholders who manage these policies include central and state government \nbodies,  such  as  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission and  the state \nelectricity regulatory commissions. \nManagement  The team consists of experts with vast experience in the renewable energy segment. \nThe senior management team is headed by Ranjit Gupta, CEO of Ostro Energy \nPrivate Limited, and previously the founding CEO of Indiabulls Power in 2007.  \nImplementation period  December 2017 \u2013 October 2018 \nConstruction arrangements    \nType of arrangement   The project will be implemented through a lump-sum turnkey arrangement. The \n  contracts are expected to include the standard clauses on termination and liquidated \ndamages, which are sized to account for the charges and penalties that may result \nfrom delays in implementation. The level of the liquidated damages has been vetted \nby the lender\u2019s independent engineer and confirmed to be in line with industry \npractice. \n    Contractor  Vestas Wind Technology India Private Limited is the engineering, procurement and \nconstruction contractor for the project and responsible for delivering the project within \nthe time schedule and at a fixed price. \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  OKWPL has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with PTC India Limited at \na fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per unit.  \nOperation and maintenance  OKWPL is expected to enter into a comprehensive operation and maintenance \ncontract with Vestas Wind Technology India Private Limited.  \n    Performance monitoring  Key  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  will  be \nreported by OKWPL and monitored by the Asian Development Bank. \nCEO = chief executive officer and OKWPL = Ostro Kutch Wind Private Limited. \nSource: Ostro Kutch Wind Private Limited.  \n \n                                                \n9  Details of Implementation Arrangements are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.

ADB will provide up to $100 million, in Indian rupee equivalent, as limited-recourse project \nfinance loan to OKWPL for the development of the 250 MW Kutch Wind Project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  The project was awarded through the country\u2019s first wind auction at a price that now makes \nwind energy competitive with other sources of power in India (para. 3). The objective behind the \nauction was to help states with low wind resources meet their nonsolar renewable purchase \nobligation at a competitive price. ADB\u2019s assistance in the form of a long-term loan will significantly \nimprove project financials. This will have a signaling effect by affirming the commercial viability of \ncompetitively  bid  wind  projects  as  well  as  the  significant  technological  improvements  and \ninnovations in the wind power industry, which justify lower tariffs for cost recovery. It will also \nalleviate industry concerns about the commercial viability of such projects without any subsidy \nand incentives. \n \nC.  Risks  \n24.  Revenue and resource. The lender\u2019s wind resource assessment advisor has conducted \nan independent wind resource assessment10 to verify the resource and energy estimation. \nConservative P90 assumptions11 are used in the financial projections as the base case. Gujarat \nwas the first Indian state to install a wind project in 1986. The wind resource consultant has over \n29 years of proprietary data to estimate the wind resource conditions. The quality of the estimates \nhas improved over the years thanks to an increase in the number of data points. In addition, the \nhigher hub heights, increase in rotor diameter, and improvement in technology allow turbines to \noperate in low wind conditions compared with other 2 MW-rated wind turbine generators, yielding \na better output. In case the PPAs are terminated before its tenor, OKWPL will have the option to \nsell power in the spot market, since the project is connected to the CTU. \n \n25.  Offtaker. OKWPL has signed four 25-year PPAs with PTC at a fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per \nunit for its entire capacity which materially mitigates revenue risk. The offtaker, PTC, has an \nacceptable  balance  sheet  and  the  highest  short-term  rating  of  A1+  by  CRISIL,  which \ndemonstrates adequate financial capacity. PTC has a good payment track record and its LOCs \nhave never been drawn. PTC, unlike state electricity distribution companies, has a diverse pool \nof revenues. It has already entered into contractual arrangements for the sale of the entire \ncapacity made available under the auction scheme.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n                                                \n10  Wind resource assessment is the process to estimate the future energy production of a wind farm. \n11   Probability of exceedance of 90%. In other words, the wind estimates are expected to be exceeded 90% of the time. \n ", "6 \n26.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n27.   Evacuation. One of the key risks that renewable energy projects encounter is curtailment \nor back-down by grid operators. The project will be connected to the CTU, and since renewable \nenergy projects have a must-run status under the grid code, this risk is largely mitigated.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n28.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. An independent consultant prepared the initial environmental examination \n(IEE), which has identified potential environmental and social impacts and suggested effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for any adverse impacts resulting from \nthe project\u2019s operations. The institutional capacity and commitment of OKWPL to manage the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed to be adequate. The International Finance \nCorporation, an existing lender to some of OKWPL\u2019s projects, has helped the company put in \nplace an environmental and social management system that is also compliant with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. \n \n33.   The IEE has assessed the potential environmental and social impacts of the project \nacross its complete life cycle. The siting of the turbines will be done away from sensitive \nenvironments and social receptors to avoid impacts associated with shadow flicker, noise, blade \nthrow, and other safety risks. A total of 168 potential locations have been identified for the \ninstallation of the wind turbine generators (WTGs). Of these, only 125 will be required. WTG \nlocations that are close to sensitive environmental or social receptors will be left out of the final \nselection. All the WTGs should be located on government-owned revenue lands, which will be \nallotted to the project. The IEE has assessed and documented that the land is free from \nencumbrances and that no physical or economic displacement issues are involved in the transfer \nof these lands. Other project subcomponents like the transmission line and the access roads will \nbe located on a mix of government and private lands. While government lands will be transferred \nto the project, private lands will be directly purchased through negotiated one-time settlements \nwith individual landowners under a willing seller\u2013willing buyer arrangement. The environmental \nand social management system of the company includes a framework for documenting land \npurchases through negotiated settlements. An independent audit of the land purchase process ", "  7 \nwill be done to validate the fairness of the negotiation and settlement process and conformance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34.  The construction-phase impacts are mostly linked to activities such as vegetation clearing, \naccess roads, transportation and delivery of equipment, excavation and the laying of foundations, \nand  installation of wind turbines. Mitigation measures for impacts associated  with noise, air \npollution, waste management, occupational and community health and safety, and traffic are clearly \ndelineated in the IEE. No wildlife or bird sanctuary or national parks are present within 50 kilometers \nof the proposed project site. Significant impacts or threats to avifauna are not envisaged as a result \nof setting up the WTGs. The IEE has proposed design measures such as painting the tip of blades \nand installing flash lamps on WTGs to prevent collision risks. Operational-phase bird and bat \nmonitoring will be carried out and mitigation measures implemented in the event of any future \nimpacts on avifauna. No known migratory flyways coincide with the project area. Noise and \nshadow flicker impacts associated with the project were assessed to be low and will be managed \nthrough siting of the turbine locations and implementation of mitigation measures proposed in the \nenvironmental and social management plan. The project and its activities will not result in impacts \non indigenous peoples. No lands owned, used, occupied, or claimed as ancestral domain by \nscheduled tribes12 is being used for the development of the project. \n \n35.  OKWPL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.13 OKWPL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with \nsuch laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.14  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n36.  OKWPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
