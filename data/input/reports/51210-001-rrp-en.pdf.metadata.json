The project involves the installation of 125 V-110 Vestas turbines \nof  2  MW of  wind  capacity  each. OKWPL  has  signed four  power  purchase agreements  (PPAs) \nwith  PTC  India  Limited  (PTC)  for  the  sale  of  250  MW  wind  power  produced  by  the  project. \nFacilitating the delivery of the country\u2019s first wind auctioned project, the project demonstrates the \ncommercial viability of competitively bid wind projects and encourages long term private sector \nfinancing in this sector. The project will also help reduce the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels \nand promote renewable energy development. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n3. \nIn 2015, the Government of India set an ambitious target of achieving 175 gigawatts (GW) \nof renewable energy capacity by 2022\u2014100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, and 15 GW from \nother  sources.  In  pursuit  of  that  target,  India  added  11  GW  of  renewable  energy  capacity  in \nFY2017, taking the total to 57 GW as of 31 March 2017. Of that total, wind contributed 5.4 GW \nand  solar  5.6  GW.1 Historically,  allocation  of  solar  power  projects  in  India  has  been  through \nreverse bidding mechanism,2 which has resulted in the tariff falling to  \u20b92.44  per  kilowatt-hour  in \n2017, from \u20b912.16 per unit in 2011. However, the allocation of wind power projects  was made \nunder the feed-in tariff policy. In June 2016, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy launched \nthe country\u2019s first wind energy auction to set up 1,050 MW of wind power projects to be connected \nto the national grid and to be managed by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited that serves as \nthe central transmission utility (CTU). The auction aimed to procure the supply of wind power at \na  price  achieved  through  transparent  bidding  procedures  and  to  help  meet  the  nonsolar \nrenewable purchase obligations for states with poor wind resources.  \n \n4. \nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy designated the Solar Energy Corporation of \nIndia (SECI) as the implementing agency for the auction. OKWPL won 250 MW of capacity under \nthe scheme and has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the debt financing of \nthe  project.  Ostro  Energy  Private  Limited  (OEPL),  a  renewable  energy  independent  power \nproducer in India, currently owns 100% of the shares in OKWPL, the project company. As of July \n2017, OEPL has an operating wind power capacity of 648 MW spread across four states: Andhra \nPradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Government of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  http://mnre.gov.in; Government of India, Ministry of \n\nPower, Central Electricity Authority. http://cea.nic.in \n\n2   Reverse bidding is a mechanism where the upper tariff cap is set and projects are awarded to bidders quoting the \n\nlowest bid price. \n\n\f2 \n\n2. \n\n Project Design \n\n5. \nThe  project  is  being  developed  on  a  build\u2013own\u2013operate  basis  and  is  required  to  be \ncommissioned within 18 months from the date of issue of the letter of award. SECI issued the \nletter of award on 5 April 2017. PTC is appointed as the intermediary to carry out the purchase \nand sale of wind power procured under the auction. OKWPL was selected as one of the winning \nbidders and has signed four PPAs on substantially the same terms for the sale of 250  MW, in \naggregate, at a fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per unit with PTC as the counterparty.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n6. \nThe government founded PTC in 1999 to promote power trading in India. Since then, PTC \nhas  grown  to  be  the  largest  player  in  the  power  trading  market.  PTC  signs  PPAs  with  power \nproject  developers  and,  in  turn,  signs  power  sale  agreements  with  offtakers,  acting  as  an \nintermediary  between  the  generators  and  consumers.  PTC  mitigates  counterparty  risk  by \ndiversifying its customer base  across multiple states and through recourse to various payment \nsecurity mechanisms. In FY2017, PTC traded 48.32 billion units through both long-term and short-\nterm contracts and reported revenues of \u20b9140 billion with net profit of \u20b92.91 billion. As of 31 March \n2017, PTC had total assets worth \u20b966 billion and a net worth of \u20b930.7 billion on a stand-alone \nbasis. PTC has two subsidiaries, PTC Energy Ltd (PEL) and PTC India Financial Services Limited \n(PFS). PEL undertakes development of wind power projects and has a total operating capacity of \n288.8 MW. PFS is registered as a nonbank finance company with the Reserve Bank of India and \nprovides  financing  to  infrastructure  projects.  All  the  liabilities  of  PEL  and  PFS  are  on  a \nnonrecourse basis, and PTC does not have any ongoing obligations toward these two companies. \nPTC does not have any long-term credit rating. However, it has the highest short-term rating of \nA1+ by CRISIL. \n \n7. \n For  the  proposed  project,  OKWPL  has  entered  into  a  term  sheet  with  the  intention  of \nentering  into  a  date-certain,  fixed-price  turnkey  engineering  procurement  and  construction \narrangement with Vestas Wind Technology India Private Limited (Vestas India), a leading supplier \nof wind turbines in India. The term sheet covers key elements of the engineering, procurement, \nand  construction  strategy  arrangements,  including  land  and  site  development,  installation  and \ncommissioning,  wind  turbine  supply,  and  power  evacuation.  Tractebel  Engineering  Private \nLimited  is  appointed  as  the  lender\u2019s  independent  engineer  (LIE)  and  3Tier  R&D  India  Private \nLimited is appointed as the lender\u2019s wind resource assessment advisor. The LIE has reviewed \nthe  term  sheet  and  has  confirmed  that  the  terms  are  satisfactory  and  in  line  with  the  industry \nnorms.  According to the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction term sheet,  any failure  to \ncommission the project as per timelines results in liquidated damages payable by Vestas India to \ncompensate OKWPL for damages, and are sized to include the penalty charged by SECI.   \n \nVestas India has significant experience in India, with over 3 GW of installed capacity in \n8. \nIndia alone. Vestas Wind Systems A/S (Vestas), which has 83 GW of installed capacity across \n75 different countries, owns Vestas India. Vestas is listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen exchange. \nIt has a market capitalization of DKr130.8 billion ($20.66 billion)3 as on 12 August 2017. In 2016, \nVestas reported  annual revenues  of  \u20ac10.2  billion  ($12.06  billion)  and  net  profit  of  \u20ac965 million \n($1.1 billion). Vestas has \u20ac9.9 billion ($11.7 billion) in total assets for 2016. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  located  at  taluka  Bhuj  and  Anjar,  in  the  district  of  Kutch  in  the  State  of \nGujarat. The project involves installation of 125 V-110 Vestas turbines of 2 MW of wind capacity \n\n                                                \n3   Using an exchange rate of DKr1 = $0.16. \n\n\feach. The  project  will  be  connected  to the  CTU at  Bachau substation  via  a  62-kilometer,  220-\nkilovolt transmission line. A total of 1 hectare of land is required for each wind turbine location. \nOKWPL has confirmed that all of the land for the wind turbines is government-owned revenue \nland, which will be leased and/or allotted to OKWPL. \n \n\n3 \n\n3. \n\nBorrower and Sponsor \n\nConfidential information deleted.. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n12. \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impacts:  (i)  diversified  energy  mix  in \nIndia by adding renewable energy capacity, helping the country reduce its dependence on fossil \nfuels; and (ii) the promotion of cost-competitive, convenient, safe, and reliable new and renewable \nenergy supply options, which can be achieved through greater private sector participation.  \n \n13. \nOutcome. The project will help increase delivery of clean power sustainably produced by \nthe  private  sector.  It  will  generate  762  GW-hours  of  clean  energy  per  annum  and  help  avoid \n669,036 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from 2020. \n \n14. \n2018, and (ii) growth of local economy supported. \n \nC. \n\n Outputs. The outputs will be (i) wind power production capacity increased by October \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n15. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project\u2019s  development \nsupports  infrastructure  and  environment,  two  of  ADB\u2019s  five  core  operational  areas,  as  per  its \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.4 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2018-2022  for  India  is \nbased on three developmental pillars: (i) boosting economic competitiveness to create more and \nbetter  jobs,  (ii)  inclusive  provision  of  infrastructure  networks  and  services,  and  (iii)  addressing \nclimate change and increasing climate resilience.5 This project paticularly supports pillar (iii). \n \n16. \nConsistency with sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy,6 which prioritizes support for renewable energy development. In September \n2015,7 ADB announced that it would double its annual climate financings to $6 billion by 2020. Of \nthis $6 billion, $4 billion is for mitigation which includes scaling up support for renewable energy. \nThe project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s previous operations in the energy sector in Gujarat. In \n2013, ADB provided a $100 million loan to strengthen the transmission network in Gujarat.8  \n \n17. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.

Other important lessons from the earlier \ntransactions in the renewable energy segment include the need to focus on (i) risks associated \nwith  land  acquisition  and  acquisition  of  rights-of-way,  (ii)  adequate  power  evacuation \ninfrastructure, and (iii) receivables and payment delays with offtakers. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe key policies that govern renewable energy in India are (i) the Electricity Act 2003, \nwhich  establishes  the  overall  framework  for  the  power  sector;  (ii)  the  National \nElectricity  Policy  of  2005,  a  requirement  under  the  Electricity  Act  that  directs  the \ncentral government to establish a guideline for power development, in consultation \nwith  key  stakeholders; and  (iii)  the  Tariff  Policy  2006,  which  prescribes key  rates, \nratios, and other factors to ensure the viability and efficiency of power projects. Key \nstakeholders  who  manage  these  policies  include  central  and  state  government \nbodies,  such  as  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  and  the  state \nelectricity regulatory commissions. \nThe team consists of experts with vast experience in the renewable energy segment. \nThe  senior  management  team  is  headed  by  Ranjit  Gupta,  CEO  of  Ostro  Energy \nPrivate Limited, and previously the founding CEO of Indiabulls Power in 2007.  \nDecember 2017 \u2013 October 2018 \n \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  through  a  lump-sum  turnkey  arrangement.  The \ncontracts are expected to include the standard clauses on termination and liquidated \ndamages, which are sized to account for the charges and penalties that may result \nfrom delays in implementation. The level of the liquidated damages has been vetted \nby  the  lender\u2019s  independent  engineer  and  confirmed  to  be  in  line  with  industry \npractice. \nVestas Wind Technology India Private Limited is the engineering, procurement and \nconstruction contractor for the project and responsible for delivering the project within \nthe time schedule and at a fixed price. \n  \nOKWPL has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with PTC India Limited at \na fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per unit.  \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements  \n\nType of arrangement  \n \n\n    Contractor \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and maintenance  OKWPL  is  expected  to  enter  into  a  comprehensive  operation  and  maintenance \n\n    Performance monitoring \n\ncontract with Vestas Wind Technology India Private Limited.  \nKey  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  will  be \nreported by OKWPL and monitored by the Asian Development Bank. \n\nCEO = chief executive officer and OKWPL = Ostro Kutch Wind Private Limited. \nSource: Ostro Kutch Wind Private Limited.  \n \n\n                                                \n9  Details of Implementation Arrangements are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n\f \n\n21. \n \n\nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n Confidential information deleted. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n5 \n\n ADB will provide up to $100 million, in Indian rupee equivalent, as limited-recourse project \n\n22. \nfinance loan to OKWPL for the development of the 250 MW Kutch Wind Project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n   \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \nThe project was awarded through the country\u2019s first wind auction at a price that now makes \nwind energy competitive with other sources of power in India (para. 3). The objective behind the \nauction  was  to  help  states  with  low  wind  resources  meet  their  nonsolar  renewable  purchase \nobligation at a competitive price. ADB\u2019s assistance in the form of a long-term loan will significantly \nimprove project financials. This will have a signaling effect by affirming the commercial viability of \ncompetitively  bid  wind  projects  as  well  as  the  significant  technological  improvements  and \ninnovations  in  the  wind  power  industry,  which  justify  lower  tariffs  for  cost  recovery.  It  will  also \nalleviate industry concerns about the commercial viability of such projects without any subsidy \nand incentives. \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n24. \nRevenue and resource. The lender\u2019s wind resource assessment advisor has conducted \nan  independent  wind  resource  assessment 10  to  verify  the  resource  and  energy  estimation. \nConservative P90 assumptions11 are used in the financial projections as the base case. Gujarat \nwas the first Indian state to install a wind project in 1986. The wind resource consultant has over \n29 years of proprietary data to estimate the wind resource conditions. The quality of the estimates \nhas improved over the years thanks to an increase in the number of data points. In addition, the \nhigher hub heights, increase in rotor diameter, and improvement in technology allow turbines to \noperate in low wind conditions compared with other 2 MW-rated wind turbine generators, yielding \na better output. In case the PPAs are terminated before its tenor, OKWPL will have the option to \nsell power in the spot market, since the project is connected to the CTU. \n \n25. \nOfftaker. OKWPL has signed four 25-year PPAs with PTC at a fixed tariff of \u20b93.46 per \nunit  for  its  entire  capacity  which  materially  mitigates  revenue  risk.  The  offtaker,  PTC,  has  an \nacceptable  balance  sheet  and  the  highest  short-term  rating  of  A1+  by  CRISIL,  which \ndemonstrates adequate financial capacity. PTC has a good payment track record and its LOCs \nhave never been drawn. PTC, unlike state electricity distribution companies, has a diverse pool \nof  revenues.  It  has  already  entered  into  contractual  arrangements  for  the  sale  of  the  entire \ncapacity made available under the auction scheme.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n\n                                                \n10   Wind resource assessment is the process to estimate the future energy production of a wind farm. \n11    Probability of exceedance of 90%. In other words, the wind estimates are expected to be exceeded 90% of the time. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n Confidential information deleted. \n\n26. \n \n27. \n Evacuation. One of the key risks that renewable energy projects encounter is curtailment \nor back-down by grid operators. The project will be connected to the CTU, and since renewable \nenergy projects have a must-run status under the grid code, this risk is largely mitigated.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n Construction.  Vestas  India  is  expected  to  sign  fixed-price  and  date-certain  turnkey \ncontracts. This is expected to largely mitigate construction risk.

An independent consultant prepared the initial environmental examination \n(IEE),  which  has  identified  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and suggested  effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for any adverse impacts resulting from \nthe  project\u2019s  operations.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  OKWPL to manage  the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed to be adequate. The International Finance \nCorporation,  an  existing lender  to  some of OKWPL\u2019s  projects,  has  helped the  company  put  in \nplace  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  that  is  also  compliant  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. \n \n33. \n The  IEE  has  assessed  the  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project \nacross  its  complete  life  cycle.  The  siting  of  the  turbines  will  be  done  away  from  sensitive \nenvironments and social receptors to avoid impacts associated with shadow flicker, noise, blade \nthrow,  and  other  safety  risks.  A  total  of  168  potential  locations  have  been  identified  for  the \ninstallation  of  the  wind  turbine  generators  (WTGs).  Of  these,  only  125  will  be  required.  WTG \nlocations that are close to sensitive environmental or social receptors will be left out of the final \nselection. All the WTGs should be located on government-owned revenue lands, which will be \nallotted  to  the  project.  The  IEE  has  assessed  and  documented  that  the  land  is  free  from \nencumbrances and that no physical or economic displacement issues are involved in the transfer \nof these lands. Other project subcomponents like the transmission line and the access roads will \nbe located on a mix of government and private lands. While government lands will be transferred \nto the project, private lands will be directly purchased through negotiated one-time settlements \nwith individual landowners under a willing seller\u2013willing buyer arrangement. The environmental \nand  social  management  system  of  the  company  includes  a  framework  for  documenting  land \npurchases through negotiated settlements. An independent audit of the land purchase process \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nwill be done to validate the fairness of the negotiation and settlement process and conformance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34. \nThe construction-phase impacts are mostly linked to activities such as vegetation clearing, \naccess roads, transportation and delivery of equipment, excavation and the laying of foundations, \nand  installation  of  wind  turbines.  Mitigation  measures  for  impacts  associated  with  noise,  air \npollution, waste management, occupational and community health and safety, and traffic are clearly \ndelineated in the IEE. No wildlife or bird sanctuary or national parks are present within 50 kilometers \nof the proposed project site. Significant impacts or threats to avifauna are not envisaged as a result \nof setting up the WTGs. The IEE has proposed design measures such as painting the tip of blades \nand  installing  flash  lamps  on  WTGs  to  prevent  collision  risks.  Operational-phase  bird  and  bat \nmonitoring will  be  carried  out  and  mitigation  measures implemented  in  the  event  of  any future \nimpacts  on  avifauna.  No  known  migratory  flyways  coincide  with  the  project  area.  Noise  and \nshadow flicker impacts associated with the project were assessed to be low and will be managed \nthrough siting of the turbine locations and implementation of mitigation measures proposed in the \nenvironmental and social management plan. The project and its activities will not result in impacts \non  indigenous  peoples.  No  lands  owned,  used,  occupied,  or  claimed  as  ancestral  domain  by \nscheduled tribes12 is being used for the development of the project. \n \n35. \nOKWPL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.13 OKWPL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with \nsuch  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.14  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n36. \nOKWPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n37. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),15 \n38. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  OKWPL.
