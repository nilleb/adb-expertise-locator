In  2010,  natural  gas  exports  totaled  about  $3.5  billion,  accounting  for \n29% of total exports of goods and services and 10% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.1 \nThe Government of Uzbekistan has sought to develop new gas resources to replace its existing \nfields,  where  production  is  declining,  and  to  meet  expected  increased  demand  from  the \ndomestic  market  and  the  expanding  export  market.  The  government  plans  to  develop  new \nproduction and modernization projects valued at a total of $19.4 billion for oil and gas from 2011 \nto  2015,  of  which  85%  is  expected  to  be  funded  by  foreign  direct  investment  and  external \nloans.2  \n \nThe Uzbekistan gas subsector is state-controlled and managed through Uzbekneftegaz, \n3. \na national holding company.3 Uzbekneftegaz\u2019s financial resources are not considered adequate \nto meet the significant investment required to fund the growth of the Uzbekistan gas subsector \nand its capacity to develop more technically challenging gas fields may be limited. In recognition \nof  these  constraints,  the  government  has  encouraged  major  foreign  oil  and  gas  operators  to \npartner  with  Uzbekneftegaz  and  bring  in  much-needed  external  capital  and  expertise  to  meet \nthe development targets of the gas subsector. \n \nKandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady fields are two large gas fields in the Bukhara\u2013Khiva region \n4. \nin  the  southwestern  part  of  central  Uzbekistan.  Lukoil  Group  (Lukoil),  a  major  international  oil \nand  gas  operator,  is  developing  the  two  fields  under  a  production  sharing  agreement  (PSA). \nNatural gas in these fields has a high sulfur content, which requires a sophisticated drilling and \ndesulfurization  process.  Lukoil  will  be  bringing  in  state-of-the-art  technology  to  these  fields  to \nrealize environment-friendly and economically efficient gas production. \n \n5. \nLukoil first discussed the project with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2007. \nLukoil  invited  ADB  to  lead  the  transaction  and  mobilize  the  cofinancing  and  political  risk \ninsurance, as no commercial bank has ever lent money to any major gas project in Uzbekistan. \nThe proposed project is thus seen as trailblazing, with much wider ramifications for energy and \ninfrastructure  development  and  financing  in  Uzbekistan.  To  facilitate  the  participation  of  ADB \nand commercial banks , the government committed to allowing the sponsor to publicly disclose \npayments  made  by  it  under  the  PSA  to  the  government  for  the  life  of  the  ADB  loan  (ongoing \n\n                                                \n1   Economic Intelligence Unit. 2011. Country Report Uzbekistan. London.  \n2   Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan. 2010. On Priority Directions for Industrial Development \n\nof Uzbekistan for 2011\u20132015. Tashkent (PP-1442). \n\n3   Uzbekneftegaz, established in accordance with the edict of the President of Uzbekistan in 1998, is a state-owned \n\ncompany involved in all oil and gas businesses in Uzbekistan.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ndisclosure by the sponsors will be an ongoing condition of the ADB loan). This disclosure will be \nmade on an annual basis in English and Uzbek.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe development and production of Kandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady gas fields is governed \nby  a  PSA  signed  in  June  2004  between  the  government  and  a  consortium  of  investors \ncomprising LOU and Uzbekneftegaz. The PSA defines the rights and obligations of the various \nparties.  LOU  is  solely  responsible  for  the  funding,  development,  and  operation  of  the  two  gas \nfields. The cash flows of the Kandym and Khauzak\u2013Shady gas fields will be segregated.  \n \n7. \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan and the PRG-covered commercial loan will only be used \nto  finance  the  Kandym  gas  field,  which  is  in  its  development  stage.  The  ADB  loan  and  PRG-\ncovered  commercial  loan  will  be  repaid  only  from  the  cash  flows  of  Khauzak\u2013Shady  gas  field \nwhich is a producing field (gas production started in 2007). The cash flows of Khauzak- Shady \nare considered adequate to service the ADB loan and PRG.  \n \n8. \nconstruction  of  \n production  wells,  gas  collection  clusters,  a  gas-processing  plant,  ancillary  infrastructure,  and \nother  associated  facilities.  Khauzak\u2013Shady  gas  production  started  in  November  2007.  LOU \nplans to expand production capacity of Khauzak\u2013Shady field. \n \n9. \nThe  raw  gas  extracted  from  the  fields  is  transported  through  a  pipeline  to  a  gas \nprocessing  plant  (GPP)  where  the  gas  is  treated  to  remove  sulfur  and  condensates.  The  gas \nfrom  Kandym  will  be  processed  at  a  Lukoil-owned  GPP  that  is  currently  under  construction, \nwhile Khauzak\u2013Shady gas is processed by a government-owned GPP located in Mubarek. The \nprocessed  gas  is  then  transported  through  government-owned  trunk  pipelines  to  the  Uzbek \nborder  with Kazakhstan where the  gas  is  sold  to  an  offtaker  (currently  Gazprom  Export  of  the \nRussian Federation).  \n \n\nfield  development  program  will \n\nThe  Kandym \n\ncomprise \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\nBorrower. The borrower is LOU, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands and \n10. \nan  indirectly,  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Lukoil.  LOU  has  formed  two  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries\u2014Lukoil Uzbekistan Operating Company (LUOC) to operate the assets of the PSA, \nand Lukoil Overseas Supply and Trading to market the gas under the PSA.  \n \n11. \nLukoil.  Lukoil  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  vertically  integrated  oil  and  gas  companies \nactive  in  exploration  and  production  of  oil  and  gas,  production  of  petroleum  products  and \npetrochemicals,  and  marketing  of  these  products.  Most  of  the  group's  exploration  and \nproduction  has  been  based  in  the  Russian  Federation,  but  it  has  expanded  to  international \nmarkets  in  Africa,  Central  Asia,  and  Iraq.  Lukoil  owns  modern  refineries,  and  gas  processing \nand  petrochemical  plants  located  in  the  Russian Federation  and  eastern  and  western  Europe; \nits  products  are  marketed  in  the  Russian  Federation,  eastern  and  western  Europe,  and  the \nUnited States. The parent company of Lukoil (OAO Lukoil) is a publicly listed company on the \nLondon  Stock  Exchange  and  has  long-term  investment  grade  ratings  from  Moody\u2019s  (Baa2: \nstable) and Standard & Poor\u2019s (BBB\u2013: stable) as of the end of June 2011.  \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n\f3 \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n12. \nThe successful development of Kandym field, a major gas field, will lead to the following \nbeyond-project development impacts. First, the overall Uzbekistan gas subsector will expand by \nencouraging  foreign  operators  to  develop  similar  gas  reserves  and  will  bring  in  much-needed \ntechnical knowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. Second, the increase in gas \nproduction will lead to an increase in natural gas exports (one of the most important sources of \nexport  revenue  for  the  country)  and  opens  the  possibility  of  development  of  the  downstream \npetrochemical subsector in Uzbekistan, which uses natural gas as its feedstock. An increase of \ngas resources will also make it viable for Uzbekistan to diversify its export market eastward to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)\u2014a  pipeline  is  already  in  place.  Third,  the  successful \nexperience  of  foreign  commercial  banks  financing  a  large  project  in  Uzbekistan  (a  first  in  the \nUzbekistan market) is expected to bring in new money from international commercial banks and \nforeign investors. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n13. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  successful  production  of  natural  gas  in  Kandym  with  first \nproduction estimated in 2015, with a peak of 8.1 bcm achieved by 2018. The gas produced will \nlead  to  increased  export  revenues  for  Uzbekistan  and  improved  governance  through  the \ndisclosure of payments from the project to the government. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  development  of  an  environmentally  safe,4 technically  sound, \n14. \nand financially sustainable Kandym field;  (ii) successful mobilization of large-scale cofinancing \nfrom  foreign  commercial  banks  and  (iii) increased  local  employment  generation  in  a  relatively \npoor rural area in the Bukhara\u2013Khiva region. The project will meet 80% of its employment needs \nlocally with an expected local employment generation of over 7,000 people. The project area is \na  region  with  high  unemployment,  increasing  migration  movements,  and  low  education  and \nmedical service. One way of improving the socioeconomic environment of the Bukhara region is \nto  attract  external  investment  to  provide  employment  opportunities  to  the  local  population. \nEmployment generated by the project will create a large number of opportunities for the citizens \nof Bukhara region and other neighboring provinces. \n \nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020  \n\nStrategy  2020  identifies  the  energy  sector  as  a  core  operations  sector. 5\n\n \n15. \n Catalyzing \ninvestments by increasing private sector participation in ADB's developing member countries is \none  of  the  five  strategic  drivers  of  change.  The  project  contributes  to  environmentally \nsustainable growth by enhancing efficient natural resource management in Uzbekistan through \ncapacity  development,  technology  deployment,  and  introduction  of  international  safeguard \nstandards  and  best  operating  practices.  The  project  has  the  potential  to  contribute  to  the \npromotion  of  regional  integration  between  the  PRC,  Kazakhstan,  and  Uzbekistan  via  potential \n\n                                                \n4   The project will employ sophisticated desulfurization technology, which will lead to production of natural gas  from \n\nthe high-sulfur gas fields in an environmentally safe manner. \n\n5  ADB.  2008.

By supporting the project, which \nis sponsored by a private foreign company (Lukoil), ADB will catalyze foreign direct investment \ninto the country in a sector with significant export potential.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy \n\n \n17. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with the  ADB  Energy  Policy,  which provides  for  assistance to \ngas  field  development,  and  transportation  and  distribution  of  gas;  encourages  private  sector \ninvestment; and promotes effective regional cooperation to strengthen energy security.7  \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan  \n\nThe development of the gas fields requires continuous capital expenditure, as new wells \n18. \nmust be drilled to maintain production to compensate for depleted wells. Kandym field will have \na field life extending for the next two decades.  \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n19. \nKhauzak\u2013Shady  is  a  producing  field.  The  bulk  of  the  capital  expenditure  required  for \nKhauzak\u2013Shady to meet the necessary production volumes are to be made during 2011\u20132013. \nThe project cost estimates are presented in Table 1.

The rest of \nthe capital expenditure for Kandym over the life of the ADB loan is to be covered by project cash \nflows and Lukoil contributions. The Islamic Development Bank will provide $100 million and the \ncommercial lenders will provide $100 million loan for the Khauzak\u2013Shady field. The $100 million \nIslamic  Development  Bank  loan  and  the  $100  million  commercial  loan  are  expected  to  be \nutilized  for  Khauzak\u2013Shady  field  but  would  have  the  flexibility,  if  required,  to  be  used  for \nKandym  field.

The ADB loan will have a maximum term of up to 8 years, including a grace period \nof  18  months  and  will  be  repaid  quarterly.  The  ADB  loan  will  carry  an  interest  rate  as  well  as \nother fees to be approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee.  \n \n25. \nThe  proposed  PRG  of  up  to  $200  million  principal,  plus  interest  and  PRG  fees,  to \ncommercial  lenders  will  cover  a  loan  from  commercial  lenders  to  the  borrower  to  finance \ndevelopment  of  Kandym gas field. The  PRG  will  have a tenor  of  up  to  7  years  and  match  the \ntenor  of  the  loan  from  commercial  lenders.  Under  the  PRG,  ADB  will  assume  the  risks  of \ncurrency  inconvertibility,  nontransferability  of  funds,  war,  terrorism  and  political  violence,  and \nbreach of contract (arbitration award default and denial of recourse) on the guaranteed portion \nof  the  commercial  lenders\u2019  loan.  The  guaranteed  lenders  are  expected  to  comprise  BNP \nParibas,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Corporate  and  Investment  Bank,  Korea  Development  Bank,  and \nUniCredit Bank. They are eligible under applicable ADB policies as they relate to beneficiaries \nof credit enhancement products. The PRG will carry a guarantee fee as well as other fees and \nterms  to  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  investment  committee.  ADB\u2019s  maximum  aggregate  liability \nunder  the  PRG  will  be  up  to  $225  million.8 A  portion  of  the  PRG  may  be  syndicated  through \nreinsurance contracts to counterparties that are eligible under existing ADB policies. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n26. \n\nADB assistance adds value in the following ways:  \n(i) \n\nThe ADB loan will play a leading catalytic role as it facilitates, for the first time in \nUzbekistan,  the  raising  of  large-scale,  long-term,  commercial  financing  from \ninternational  commercial  banks.  The  successful  financing  of  the  project  will \nprompt  future  raising  of  much-needed  commercial  capital  for  the  general \ndevelopment of the gas subsector and other infrastructure projects in Uzbekistan.  \nThe  ADB  PRG  is  essential  for  the  raising  of  cofinancing  as  it  (along  with  the \nMIGA guarantee) covers the political risks that commercial lenders are currently \nnot  willing  to  directly  absorb.  The  PRG  extended  by  ADB  allows  the  project  to \nraise cost-effective commercial cofinancing.  \nADB\u2019s presence in the transaction reduces the overall political risk of the project, \nwhich provides reassurance to the foreign sponsor.  \nThe  participation  of  ADB  has  been  instrumental  in  the  public  disclosure  of \npayments received by the government under the PSA for the life of the ADB loan. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                \n8   The maximum aggregate liability is the maximum amount of principal plus interest and PRG fees that ADB can be \nheld liable for under the PRG should a guaranteed event occur and ADB exercises its right to pay the lenders the \nguaranteed portion of principal and interest on scheduled payment dates. \n\n\f7 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThis  is  considered  to  be  an  important  step  forward  by  the  government  in \npromoting  transparency  for the  project;  overall  it  sends  a very  positive signal to \nthe market.  \nThe introduction of ADB\u2019s environment and social safeguards will improve overall \nsoundness of the project.  \nThe project will be the first  private sector infrastructure project financed by  ADB \nin Uzbekistan and broadens ADB\u2019s relationship with the country. The project also \nstrengthens  ADB\u2019s  relationship  with  key  development  partners\u2014the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank and MIGA. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\nThe  transaction  follows  a  reserve-based  lending  structure  for  upstream  gas  financing, \n\n27. \nwhich is common in the project financing markets.  \n \n28. \nOfftake risk. The gas produced from Khauzak\u2013Shady field is currently sold to Gazprom \nExport  (wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Russian  gas  company,  JSC  Gazprom)  through \nUztransgaz at the gas sale delivery point at the Kazakhstan\u2013Uzbekistan border. The project is \nexposed to market risk since gas volume and price are not underpinned by a long-term offtake \ncontract.  The  term  of  the  gas  sale  contract  has  historically  been  limited  to  1  year  but  so  far, \nrenewed every year. The gas sale price is the standard market price received for all gas sales \nfrom  Uzbekistan  to  the  Russian  Federation.  The  gas  sale  price  is  in  US  dollars  based  on  a \nformula linked to European gas prices. LOU is negotiating for a longer-term sales contract with \nGazprom and is considering potential sales to the PRC.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n29.  Political, legal, and regulatory risk. The transaction is exposed to Uzbek political, legal, \nand regulatory risk. These risks are perceived to be high in Uzbekistan. Foreign investment and \nproject  financing  is  a  relatively  new  area  in  Uzbekistan  with  very  few  precedents  and  the \ngovernment  is  unfamiliar  with  it.  The  country's  legal  and  regulatory  structure  as  well  as \nenforceability of security arrangements remains untested. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n30.  Development  and  operations  risk.  Lukoil  has  experience  in  the  development  and \noperation of gas fields in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, with extensive experience in \nthe  Russian  Federation.  Specifically  LOU  over  the  past  seven  years  has  demonstrated  a \nsuccessful  track  record  in  operating  and  developing  gas  fields  under  the  PSA  in  Uzbekistan. \nThe  lenders\u2019  debt  service  will  be  paid  from  the  cash  flows  of  the  Khauzak\u2013Shady  field,  which \nhas been producing gas since 2007. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nReservoir  risk.  The  independent  gas  reserves  report  of  Miller  and  Lents  and  the \n31. \nlenders\u2019 technical bank9 has verified the adequacy of proven gas reserves. The fact that lenders\u2019 \ndebt service will be paid from the cash flows of the Khauzak\u2013Shady field (a producing field) also \nmitigates the reservoir risk.  \n  \n\n                                                \n9 Technical bank is the bank which is advising the consortium of lenders on technical matters like gas reservoir. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGas processing and transportation risk. The gas produced at Khauzak\u2013Shady field is \n32. \nprocessed at Mubarek GPP, a government-owned plant. The GPP has been operating for over \n30  years  and  in 1996  enhanced  its  annual  processing  capacity  to  30  bcm. The  Mubarek GPP \nhas  been  running  successfully  and  processes  about  50%  of  all  the  natural  gas  in  Uzbekistan; \nwith  Khauzak\u2013Shady  field  accounting  for  10%  of  its  total  capacity,  it  has  capacity  to  absorb \nincreased production from Khauzak\u2013Shady field. The pipeline-quality gas that emerges from the \nMubarek  GPP  is  transported  to  the  Kazakhstan\u2013Uzbekistan  border  through  the  Central  Asia\u2013\nCenter  pipeline  with  a  capacity  of  50  bcm.  The  pipeline  is  owned  by  Uztransgaz,  the  national \npipeline company, and has been running well with ample capacity to absorb any new potential \ngas  production.  Another  option  in  the  future  is  to  ship  the  gas  using  the  Central  Asia\u2013PRC \npipeline. The PSA guarantees the priority right of LOU to process raw gas from Khauzak\u2013Shady \nfield at the Mubarek GPP and guarantees unrestricted access to the system of trunk and local \ngas pipelines in Uzbekistan.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nCash  flow  risk. The lenders\u2019 base case scenario, which is more conservative than the \n33. \nsponsor\u2019s  base  case  scenario,  shows  that  cash  flows  are  robust  enough  to  allow  the  full  debt \namount.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguard and Social Dimensions  \n\nThe  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  A,  involuntary  resettlement \n34. \ncategory B, and indigenous peoples category C under the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project have been identified and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment.  All  prior  land  acquisitions  were \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  as  documented  in  the  ADB \nsocial  safeguards  compliance  audit  report. 10 The  final  alignment  of  the  project  railway,  gas \npipelines,  field  access  roads,  and  transmission  line  have  not  yet  been  prepared;  thus,  a \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.11 These  areas  are \nsparsely populated and the landscape is vast and mostly uninhabited arid desert land; therefore, \nland  acquisition  for  these  facilities  is  expected  to  have  limited  or  no  impact.  The  institutional \ncapacity  and  commitment  of  LOU  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are \ndeemed  adequate.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  were \nconducted  in  accordance  with ADB  requirements. The  draft  environmental  impact  assessment \nwas made publicly available in June 2010 and the revised assessment was posted on the ADB \nwebsite in May 2011 in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement.12 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n35. \nThe  borrower  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  and  its  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  relating  to  the  combating  of \nmoney  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.    ADB  will  ensure  that  the  project \n\n                                                \n10 Social Safeguards Compliance Audit Report  (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  ADB. 2010.
