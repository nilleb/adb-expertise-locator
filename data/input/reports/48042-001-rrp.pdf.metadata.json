If the Board approves the proposed grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant \nto be provided by the EU. \n \n2. \nThe proposed project will increase agricultural productivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin \nthrough improving access to and use of water at farm, scheme, and river levels.2 It will support \nthe government\u2019s strategy, which aims to increase per capita income and reduce poverty among \nrural  and  pastoral  communities.  The  project  will  also  improve food  security,  substitute  imports \nfor  wheat,  improve  self-sufficiency,  and  increase  exports  of  high-value  products  such  as  fruit \nand  nuts.  The  project  will  also  create  more  economic  opportunities  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment, particularly for input suppliers and processors of agricultural produce. The project \nis  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  Afghanistan,  2016\u20132018  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSector  issues.  Afghanistan  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  the  world.  The \npoverty head count rate is 39% and 33% of the population is food insecure.4 The average gross \ndomestic product per capita during 2011\u20132015 was $634, making Afghanistan to rank 168th out \nof  183  countries  reviewed  by  the  World  Bank.5 Agriculture  is  Afghanistan\u2019s  major  source  of \nlivelihood,  employs  79%  of  the  national  workforce,  and  is  a  significant  source  of  national \nincome.  Agriculture  contributes  significantly  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product,  although \nthis has decreased from 38% in 2002 to 22% in 2014.6 The country's major staple crop is wheat, \nrepresenting  60%  of  Afghans\u2019  daily  dietary  intake. With total  production  of  5.37  million  tons  in \n2015,  Afghanistan  relies  on  import  to meet  its  requirement  with  import  dependency  of  16%  of \ntotal  food  demand  and  the  average  2011\u20132015  level  of  dependency  is  growing  at  11%  per \nannum.  Food  insecurity  is  prevalent  throughout  the  country,  but  most  critical  in  the  northern \nprovinces of Badakhshan and Bamyan, where the food insecurity index is as high as 73%.7 \n \nAfghanistan  is  a  dry  country  with  low  precipitation  as  snow  falls  in  winter,  while  crops \n4. \nrequire water in the summer. Limited access to irrigation water is a key constraint to agricultural \nproductivity,  besides  low-quality  inputs  and  traditional  agricultural  practices.  While  the  vast \nmajority of Afghans depend on agriculture for living, only 12% (or 64.4 million hectares [ha]) of \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  EU  provided and  administered  project  preparatory  technical assistance for the  feasibility study for the  Panj\u2013\n\nAmu River Basin Project. \n\n3   ADB. 2015.

FAOSTAT. http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E  (accessed on \n\n(accessed on 30 June 2016). \n\n10 May 2016). \n\n7  Central Intelligence Agency. 2014. World Factbook, 2014\u201315 (52nd edition). Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe country\u2019s terrain is arable. The rain-fed area is currently 3.7 million ha and the irrigated area \nis 3.8 million ha, each representing about 5% to 6% of the total arable land. Of the total irrigated \narea,  around  2.2  million  ha  are  single  or  double  cropped,  with  the  balance  of  1.6  million  ha \nbeing irrigated if and when water is available, at intervals of 2 to 6 years. \n \n5. \nSporadic irrigation has been the primary cause for crop yields below the world average. \nFor  example,  the  average  wheat  yield  was  2  tons/ha  in  2013  (world  average  is  3.27  tons/ha) \nand the average rice yield was 2.5 tons/ha in 2013 (world average is 4.5 tons/ha) (footnote 6). \nIrrigated  crop  yields  are  significantly  greater  than  rain-fed  yields.  For  example,  the  irrigated \nwheat yield is 2.5 times that of rain-fed. With irrigated areas producing 69% of the total wheat \noutput,  irrigation  water  is  a  critical  high-value  factor  for  yield  improvement.  While  water  is \navailable,  improving  access  to  irrigation  on  existing  irrigation  systems  faces  two  critical \nconstraints:  (i)  the  inequitable  distribution  of  water  both  between  and  within  schemes,  and  (ii) \nthe dilapidated and inefficient state of irrigation infrastructure. \n \n6. \nClimate  change  impacts.  Afghanistan  is  considered  highly  vulnerable  to  the  adverse \neffects of climate change.8 Current models indicate significant warming across all regions of the \ncountry  and  a  decrease  in  precipitation,  particularly  spring  rainfall. 9 The  anticipated  rise  in \naverage  temperatures  may  result  in  higher  frequency  of  floods  and  droughts.  Improving  the \nirrigation  infrastructure  proposed  under  the  project\u2014to  protect  irrigation  schemes  from  flood \nevents and to improve water distribution to downstream users, particularly in dry years, as well \nas watershed management\u2014will address key climate change adaptation needs identified in the \nIntended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  submitted  to  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change.10 \n \n7. \nPanj\u2013Amu  Basin  overview.  The  Panj\u2013Amu  Basin  is  located  in  the  northeast  of  the \ncountry, on the border with Tajikistan, covering the provinces of Badakhshan, Baghlan, Kunduz, \nTakhar, and part of Bamyan. It is part of the Amu River Basin, parts of which lie in Afghanistan \n(30%),  Kyrgyzstan  (2%),  Tajikistan  (61%),  Turkmenistan  (1%),  and  Uzbekistan  (6%).  It  is  the \nsecond-largest of Afghanistan's five basins, covering 14% of the land area of Afghanistan. It has \nthe highest mean annual surface water flow of all basins (22 billion cubic meters or 39% of the \nnational  total)  and  the  highest  precipitation  (393  millimeters/year).11 With  a  population  of  4.2 \nmillion (15% of total), per capita water availability is the highest of all five basins, at 7,412 cubic \nmeters  per  year,  well  above  the  water  stress  threshold.  In  spite  of  this,  water  is  not  always \navailable  in  the  right  place at  the  right time  (i.e.,  in the  tail  ends of  canals  and in downstream \nschemes  in  the  summer)  due  to  inadequate  water  distribution  structures  and  water  allocation \nregimes. While agriculture is  by far the main water  user  in the  basin  (over  98%  of  water  use), \nthe  basin  has  the  lowest  irrigated  land  area  of  all  basins  with  0.45  million  ha  under  irrigation, \naccounting for 12% total 3.80 million ha of irrigated land countrywide. Of this, only 0.18 million \nha is intensively irrigated while the remaining is irrigated only if and when water is available.12 \nThe basin is the largest wheat producer of all basins, with over 1.28 million tons (of which one \nmillion ton in irrigated area) and the largest rice producer with 263,000 tons produced in 2015. \n\n                                                \n8  Rated as extreme in the Verisk Maplecroft Climate Change Vulnerability Index 2015. \n9  M.

Rome. \n\n \n\n\fThe basin also has significant potential for crop diversification, with a number of fruits, perennial \ncrops, and vegetables already grown in the area. As such, irrigation development is a key factor \nfor  the  basin  to  maintain  its  leading  position  in  the  production  of  staple  food  and  its \ndiversification into higher-value crops. \n \n8. \nOpportunities.  Improving  water  availability  for  irrigated  agriculture,  particularly  to \ndownstream  and  tail-end  areas  through  improved  water  distribution,  will  have  a  significant \nimpact  on  agricultural  productivity,  increasing  yields  of  wheat  and  rice,  in  particular,  which  will \nresult in improved food security, reduced poverty, and import substitution (saving scarce foreign \nexchange).  Improved  water  availability  will  also  increase  crop  diversification  into  higher-value \ncrops,  including  vegetables,  fruits,  and  nuts,  which  make  up  52%  of  total  national  agricultural \nexports  of  $720  million.  When  compared  with  total  imports  of  $7.96  billion,  this  is  a  narrow \nexport base, which can be improved with project interventions. \n\n \nGovernment's  sector  strategy.  The  strategic  framework,  approved  in  2006,13 guides \n9. \nthe  water  sector  operation.  The  policy  indicates  that  (i)  communities  are  responsible  for  the \nplanning  and management  of  basin water resources,  supported  by  the Ministry  of  Energy  and \nWater (MEW); (ii) water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) have a key role in rehabilitating small and \nmedium  irrigation  schemes;  and  (iii)  user-pay  principle  enables  cost  recovery.  To  support  this \npolicy,  in  2009,  a  revised  water  law  was  enacted,  which  stipulates  that  (i)  the  river  basin \nmanagement  approach  for  water  resources  planning  would  be  followed,  led  by  MEW  through \nthe  establishment  of  sub-basin  agencies  (SBAs)  and  river  basin  agencies  (RBAs);  (ii)  service \nproviders (including WUAs) can charge for water delivery; and (iii) ownership and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of schemes will be handed over to WUAs and irrigation associations. The \nNational Water  and  Natural  Resources  Development  Program  (NWNRDP)14 approved  in  2010 \nacts  as  the  government\u2019s  sector  development  plan.  The  key  implementing  agencies  of \nNWNRDP  are  MEW  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  and  Irrigation  (MAIL).  The \nprogram targets improved irrigation for 300,000 ha; establishing and strengthening SBAs, RBAs, \ncouncils,  and  WUAs;  and  restoring  28,000  ha  of  rangeland  through  community  management. \nThe  National  Irrigation  Program,  2016\u2013202515 builds  on  the  NWNRDP  and,  with  a  budget  of \n$1.5 billion, aims to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat through (i) improved irrigation services; (ii) \nenhanced  extension  services;  and  (iii)  improved  on-farm  water  management,  operation,  and \nmaintenance. \n\n \n10. \nNWNRDP  implementation  results  as  of  2015  suggest  that  the  2006  policy  framework \nand the 2009 revised water law are appropriate for sector needs, but can be improved further by \nclarifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  MEW  and  MAIL,  and  ensuring  the  long-term \nsustainability of infrastructure through regular maintenance. The proposed project supports this \nthrough the establishment and strengthening of WUAs, and development of O&M policy (para. \n32).  NWNRDP  results  also  confirm  the  adequate  institutional  capacity  of  the  implementing \nagencies (MEW and MAIL), which are also the implementing agencies of the project. MEW and \nMAIL  have  implemented  a  number  of  sector  projects  of  similar  nature.  The  project  will \nprovide additional  capacity  building  in  procurement  and  financial  management,  environmental \nimpact assessment, and social analysis in accordance with ADB procedures.  \n \n\n                                                \n13 Government of Afghanistan. 2006.

The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB's  water \noperational  plan,  2011\u20132020; 17  and  operational  plan  for  agriculture  and  natural  resources, \n2015\u20132020.18 \n\n \n12. \nThe  project  reflects  lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  development  partner-funded \nwater  sector  projects  in  support  of  the  government\u2019s  sector  policies  and  strategies.  Key \ninitiatives include the ADB-financed Water Resources Development Investment Program, 2009\u2013\n2018;  Panj\u2013Amu  River  Basin  Program,  2009\u20132016,  financed  by  the  EU;  Irrigation  and \nWatershed  Management  Program,  2012\u20132017,  financed  by  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development;  and  World  Bank-financed  Emergency  Irrigation  Rehabilitation \nProgram,  2004\u20132011;  Technical  Assistance  for  Water  Sector  Capacity  Building,  2009\u20132011; \nIrrigation Restoration and Development Project, 2011\u20132017; and On-Farm Water Management \nProject,  2011\u20132016.19 Key  lessons  call  for  the  need  to  (i)  increase  government  ownership,  (ii) \navoid setting up parallel management structures, (iii)  set up realistic implementation plans, (iv)  \nkeep  interventions  simple  yet  effective,  and  (v)  embed  community-based  water  management \nwithin  schemes  for  effective  water  distribution  and  long-term  O&M.20 The  project  follows  the \nfragile and conflict-affected states approach in that it includes (i) sector financing, which allows \nflexibility  in  subproject  selection  and  implementation  given  security  concerns;  (ii)  streamlined \nproject management office structure, which helps long-term programmatic sector interventions; \nand  (iii)  community  participation  in  procurement  and  involvement  of  local  elders  throughout \nsubproject  cycles,  which  minimizes  interruptions  of  works  contracts.  The  project  readiness  is \nenhanced  by  the  use  of  advance  contracting  and  financing  of  taxes  and  duties  on  eligible \nproject expenditures.21 \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impacts of the project will be aligned with increased per capita income and reduced \npoverty  among  rural  and  pastoral  communities.22 The  outcome  will  be  increased  agricultural \nproductivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nOutput  1:  Water  allocation  and  availability  improved.  This  output  will  include  the \nfollowing  activities:  (i)  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  head  works  and  main  canals  in  21  priority \nirrigation  schemes  covering  estimated  total  command  area  of  74,500  ha  in  the  three  northern \nprovinces  of  Badakhshan,  Kunduz,  and  Takhar; 23  (ii)  establishing  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  approximately  112  WUAs  to  operate  and  maintain  conveyance  infrastructure  in \nthese schemes; 24 and (iii) enhancing the capacity of MEW, RBAs, and SBAs for effective water \nallocation  between  schemes  to  benefit  downstream  users.

To make infrastructure last its \neconomic life, a number of design measures are included in the project. First, gated headworks \nwill  protect  other  infrastructure  in  schemes  by  reducing  flood  damage  from  future  climate \nchange  and  variability.  Second,  for  headworks  and  main  canals,  O&M  will  be  delegated  to \nWUAs  and,  where  such  works  are  outside  WUAs\u2019  scope,  SBAs  will  be  responsible  for  O&M. \nThird,  for  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  infrastructure,  O&M  will  be  delegated  to  irrigation \nassociations. 27 Fourth,  watersheds  adjacent  to  schemes  will  be  rehabilitated  and  protected, \nreducing runoff, thus decreasing siltation of irrigation canals and lowering the risk of damage to \ninfrastructure  by flash flooding.  Fifth,  improved water  distribution  within and between schemes \nwill be ensured through the better functioning of WUAs and irrigation associations for equitable \nwater distribution within schemes (particularly middle and tail reaches receiving fair shares). The \nRBAs  and  SBAs  working  with  the  WUAs  will  ensure  that  water  is  distributed  fairly  between \nschemes. In so doing, downstream schemes will also experience benefits even if they receive \nno  direct  project  investment.  Finally,  training farmers  on  improved  on-farm  water  management \nand agronomic techniques (such as land leveling, bed and furrow irrigation, and intercropping) \nwill  also  help  leverage  infrastructure  investment  by  ensuring  that  irrigation  water  is  used \nefficiently.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n22. \nThe project will benefit approximately 55,000 farming households (over 400,000 people). \nProject  benefits  are  multifaceted.  First,  farm  household  income  is  expected  to  increase  as  a \nresult of increased cropping intensities, higher crop yields, and crop diversification. The analysis \nof  three  representative subprojects  indicates that  incremental  household incomes will  have an \naverage  increase  of  $123  (for  head  reach)  and  $615  (for  tail  reach)  per  annum.  Second, \nincremental crop labor will create an equivalent of 8,994 full-time rural jobs per annum valued at \n$8.7 million, and project construction works are expected to generate an equivalent of 1,700 full-\ntime  rural  jobs  for  6  years  with  an  estimated  value  of  $1.6  million.  Most  of  this  labor  income \ngoes to local workers drawn from poor households, which may or may not have land within the \nproject  command  area.  Third,  more  economic  opportunities  will  be  created  for  downstream \n(input  suppliers)  and  upstream  (processors  of  and  market  intermediaries  for  agricultural \nproducts) industries in the agricultural supply chain. \n \n\n                                                \n27 Irrigation  management  and  transfer  to  SBAs,  WUAs,  and  irrigation  associations  will  be  effected  through  written \n\nagreements. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe calculated economic internal rates of return for all three representative subprojects \n23. \nare greater than the opportunity cost of capital of 12% in both the base case and the sensitivity \ncases; 18% for Laqi, 23% for Sharawan, and 24% for Seyaab. These representative economic \nindicators  suggest  that,  overall,  the  project  is  economically  viable.  However,  it  is  important  to \nnote  that  the  rates  of  returns  are  highly  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  project  benefits  and  it  is \nimperative that (i) the overall project and subprojects should be implemented as scheduled, (ii) \nagricultural  extension  support  be  financed  under  output  2  in  parallel  with  the  civil  works \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  project  costs  be  utilized  within  the  range  of  estimated  bills  of \nquantities.28 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nAssessments  have  identified  risks related  to  the country's  public financial  management \n24. \nsystem  in  the  areas  of  internal  control,  procurement  management,  financial  reporting,  and \nexternal  auditing.29 Action  plans  have  been  agreed  with  MEW  and  MAIL  to  strengthen  their \nfinancial  management  and  procurement.  The  project  management  offices  in  MEW  and  MAIL, \nimplementing ongoing ADB- and World Bank-financed projects, have adequate experience and \nwill  be  able  to  effectively  implement  the  project  once  incremental  staff  are  recruited.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to MOF, MEW, and MAIL. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nPoverty. The project will benefit low-income and marginal smallholders (with household \nlandholding of 1.0\u20132.0 ha). The target provinces have some of the highest food insecurity levels \nin  the  country:  73.0%  for  Badakhshan,  34.8%  for  Takhar,  and  27.5%  for  Kunduz.  Project \ninterventions will increase production of wheat by 23,000 tons per year, significantly improving \nthe food security of project beneficiaries. The production of rice will also increase by 25,000 tons \nper  year.  Incremental  household  income  and  jobs  created  during  project  implementation  will \nsignificantly contribute to local poverty reduction.  \n\n \n26. \n Social  and  gender.    The  project  is  categorized  as  some  gender  benefit.  Gender \nactivities  will  be  mainstreamed  in  the  project.  It  will  directly  benefit  farmers,  including  poor \nhouseholds,  through  increases  in  agricultural  production  and  farm  incomes.  More  equitable \nwater  distribution  within  and  between  schemes  will  reduce  conflict  over  water  and  reduce \nincome inequality. In setting up WUAs and irrigation associations, water users will be briefed on \nthe importance of female participation. Natural resource management plans for watersheds will \nbe  prepared  with  due  regard  for  the  role  of  women  related  to  income-generating  activities. \nTraining  for  women  will  be  conducted  by  female  trainers  to  ensure  willingness  to  participate. \nThe  project  will  ease  women\u2019s  water-fetching  and  laundry  chores  with  water  access  points \ninstalled  along  canals.  In  addition,  structures  such  as  offtakes  will  be  adapted  as  footbridges \nalong the canals to facilitate movement of humans and farm produce.30 \n\n                                                \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan;  and  Procurement  Capacity  Assessment:  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nWater;  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Irrigation,  and  Livestock  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and review  framework  and \ninitial environmental examinations for three representative subprojects were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  in  July  2016.  Site-specific  environmental  impacts  may  occur  in  each  of  these \nsubprojects  during  the  construction  phase.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  and \nwill  be  implemented  through  environmental  management  plans.  ADB  conducted  public \nconsultations  for  the  representative  subprojects  in  February  2016.  The  review  framework \nensures  project  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  by  specifying  the \nenvironmental safeguards procedures required for subprojects prepared during implementation. \nEach  subproject  will  be  screened  for  environmental  classification.  Subprojects  classified \ncategory  A  will  not  be  financed.  Category  B  subprojects  will  require  an  initial  environmental \nexamination, including an environmental management plan, and incorporation of environmental \nmanagement  plan  measures  into  civil  works  contracts.  Category  C  subprojects  will  require \nsummaries  of  environmental  implications  in  their  feasibility  studies.  Adequate  resources  have \nbeen  allocated  for  environmental  safeguards  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting.31 \n \n28. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Afghanistan is inhabited by ethnic groups across its \n34  provinces.  None  of  these  groups  are  considered  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). A land acquisition and resettlement framework \nfor the entire project has been prepared to guide the preparation of subproject land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plans  (LARPs).  Subprojects  classified  category  A  will  not  be  financed.  Draft \nLARPs for three representative subprojects have been prepared, which will be updated once the \ndetailed  designs  have  been  completed.  The  three  draft  LARPs  confirm  that  there  is  no  land \nacquisition  requirement  and  no  physical  displacement.  The  only  resettlement  issues  are  the \nremoval  of  an  estimated  201  trees,  mostly  non-fruit  variety.  Right-of-way  is  a  new  concept  in \nAfghanistan and these trees are apparently grown on the public right-of-way, although privately \nused  by  the  users.  The  current  security  situation  did  not  allow  for  a  detailed  socioeconomic \nsurvey, but will be carried out for updating the draft LARPs. Appropriate mitigation measures for \ncompensation have been proposed in the entitlement matrix of the LARPs. The land acquisition \nand resettlement framework and the LARPs were disclosed on the ADB website in July 2016.32 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nOverall  project  risk  is  assessed  as  medium.
