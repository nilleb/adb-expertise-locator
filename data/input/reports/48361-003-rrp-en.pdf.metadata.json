It supports government efforts to \nimprove (i) its fiscal position by adopting prudent policies and better public financial management \n(PFM); and (ii) the business climate by continuing policy, regulatory, and public enterprise reforms. \nSubprogram 3 is the final subprogram, and builds on progress under two earlier subprograms of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners approved in fiscal year (FY) \n2016 and FY2017. 1 The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priority of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  constraints.  Tonga  faces  challenges  to  macroeconomic  resilience \nbecause  of  geographic  disadvantages,  exposure  to  shocks,  and  internal  bottlenecks.  The \npopulation of 108,000 is dispersed across 36 of Tonga\u2019s 172 islands, with about a quarter of the \npopulation  based  in  the  capital,  Nuku\u2019alofa.  Small  size  and  remoteness  increase  the  cost  of \nproviding services, limit competitiveness, and reduce economies of scale. Institutional capacity is \na  challenge,  with  a  small  cadre  of  qualified  public  servants  implementing  several  government \nfunctions.  Legislative,  cultural,  and  social  barriers  limit  women\u2019s  labor  force  participation  and \neconomic empowerment. \n \nAlthough the fiscal position has improved since the global economic crisis, Tonga remains \n4. \nheavily  dependent  on  external  assistance.3 Frequent  external  shocks  such  as  substantial  crop \nand infrastructure damage from Cyclone Ian in 2014, Cyclone Winston in 2016, and Cyclone Gita \nin  2018  jeopardize  fiscal  sustainability.  Procurement  and  financial  management  capacity  and \nsystems are improving, but need further strengthening. Tonga\u2019s business environment is stronger \nthan that of most Pacific developing countries,4 but the private sector faces several constraints \n(footnote 3) and foreign investment is about 2%\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP). While the \ncommercial  returns  of  Tonga\u2019s  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  portfolio  have  improved  since \nFY2009,  performance  is  still  volatile  and  can  be  further  improved  through  reforms  to  the \ngovernance and ownership structure of individual SOEs.5 \n \n5. \nRecent  macroeconomic  performance.  Economic  growth,  which  is  highly  volatile,  is \ndriven largely by the public sector. Tonga\u2019s GDP grew 1.9% on average during FY2009\u2013FY2018, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business \nPlan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2019\u20132021. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. \nManila.

In FY2018, Cyclone Gita caused \ndamages  of  about  $164.3  million  (36%  of  GDP),  and  the  economy  is  estimated  to  have \nexpanded  by  only  0.4%.  Recovery  and  reconstruction  are  expected  to  drive  growth  during \nFY2019\u2013FY2021, with the economy projected to grow at an annual average rate of about 2.0%. \n \n6. \nTonga\u2019s  fiscal  stance  has  generally  been  prudent,  helped  by  increasing  grants.  Public \nexpenditure  prioritization  and  strong  domestic  revenue  performance  saw  the  overall  deficit \n(including grants) shrink from 1.3% of GDP in FY2013 to a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY2017 \n(Table  1).  Higher  tax  rates  on  petroleum  products  and  unhealthy  foods  (partly  offset  by  tax \nreductions on healthy alternatives) contributed to domestic revenue, and the tax\u2013GDP ratio rose \nfrom  17.0%  in  FY2013  to  21.1%  in  FY2018.  Public  expenditure  also  increased  from  26.5%  of \nGDP  in  FY2013  to  42.8%  in  FY2018,  in  response  to  reconstruction  needs  following  periodic \ncyclones;  investments  in  key  maritime,  transport,  and  energy  infrastructure;  and  increases  in \nwages for civil servants amid frequent pressure for pay increases and cost-of-living adjustments.6 \n \n7. \nDespite  reconstruction  needs  after  Cyclone  Gita,  delays  in  scaling  up  public  spending \nresulted  in  a  fiscal  surplus  of  1.6%  of  GDP  in  FY2018.  The  government  exercised  control  on \ncapital spending by freezing various sports- and leisure-related investments. Small fiscal deficits \nare  projected  during  FY2019\u2013FY2021  as  capital  expenditure  resulting  from  reconstruction \nincreases. A new remuneration structure introduced in FY2017 is expected to stabilize longer-\nterm wage growth, after an initial cost of transitioning to the new structure in FY2018\u2013FY2019.  \n \n\n   ($ million) \n\nCurrent expenditure \n     of which: wages and salaries \n\nFY2016 \n40.6 \n30.4 \n20.6 \n10.2 \n41.1 \n31.8 \n12.1 \n9.3 \n(0.4) \n(1.6) \n(10.6) \n(42.8) \n43.7 \n403.7 \n\nFY2018e \n44.4 \n29.7 \n21.1 \n14.7 \n42.8 \n33.2 \n12.1 \n9.6 \n1.6 \n7.2 \n(13.1) \n(59.0) \n41.8 \n450.2 \n\nFY2019p \n51.9 \n29.9 \n22.9 \n22.0 \n53.0 \n36.3 \n13.1 \n16.7 \n(1.2) \n(5.6) \n(23.2) \n(107.6) \n40.9 \n463.8 \n\nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2016\u2013FY2021 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nFY2017 \n42.5 \n29.3 \n21.0 \n13.2 \n40.4 \n29.9 \n11.3 \n10.5 \n2.1 \n9.5 \n(11.1) \n(50.2) \n39.5 \n452.0 \n\nItem \nTotal revenue and grants \nTotal revenue \n \n     of which: tax revenue \n \n \nGrants \nTotal expenditure \n \n \n       Capital expenditure \nOverall balance, including grants \n \nOverall balance, excluding grants \n \nExternal debt \nGDP ($ million, current prices) \n( ) = negative, e = estimates, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Government of Tonga, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. \n \n8. \nTonga\u2019s medium-term external debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to remain stable, although its \nexternal debt distress rating changed from moderate to high risk in 2017 as the debt sustainability \nanalysis  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  incorporated  the  effects  of  potential  natural \ndisasters  into  the  methodology.7 The  government  has  successfully  avoided  non-concessional \nexternal borrowing consistent with its debt strategy adopted under subprogram 1,8 and external \ndebt is well below 50% of GDP, which is the threshold established under subprogram 2.

In 2018, ADB and the World Bank moved to 100% grants for \nTonga, which helps mitigate fiscal risks.9 The recent 5-year extension of the grace period on two \nexternal loans has also reduced medium-term fiscal pressures.10  \n \n9. \nRecent political developments. Tonga underwent political changes after the approval of \nsubprogram 2 in FY2017. In August 2017, the King dissolved the Parliament more than a year \nbefore  the  end  of  its  term.  In the  November  2017  national  elections,  the  incumbent  party  was \nreturned  to  power  with  an  expanded  majority  in  Parliament.  These  developments  were \naccompanied by several changes in the administration, including at the ministerial level.  \n \n10. \nADB contributions. ADB has supported government reforms through budget support and \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve Tonga\u2019s fiscal performance and business environment. ADB \ndisbursed  budget  support  for  Tonga  in  FY2010,  FY2014,  FY2016,  and  FY2017  to  address \ndevelopment  financing  needs  and  provide  incentives  for  implementation.  Earlier  policy-based \noperations  backed  the  government\u2019s  tax  mobilization  measures,  which  led  to  rapid  domestic \nrevenue  growth  (para.  6).  Reforms  have  addressed  civil  service  performance  management, \nintroduced a new debt management law and transparent fiscal targets to support medium-term \nfiscal  sustainability,  implemented  a  procurement  tracking  database,  and  supported  better \nprocedures to follow up on audit recommendations (including preparing new biannual reports on \naudit  recommendations  and  actions).  Advisory  services  provided  by  ADB  through  the  Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative11 helped the government strengthen corporate governance \npractices, improve the SOE monitoring framework, implement skills-based SOE director selection, \ncommercialize  selected  SOEs,  and  approve  a  foreign  investment  bill  (footnote 8).  Progressive \nimplementation of reforms has improved the performance of the SOE portfolio.12 \n \nLessons learned. Subprogram 3 reflects several lessons from previous budget support \n11. \noperations,  including  that  (i)  budget  support  can  achieve  results  if  there  is  strong  government \nownership; (ii) a programmatic engagement backed by sustained policy dialogue is an important \nmeans to advance policy reforms; (iii) close coordination with development partners is critical to \nprogress reforms in sectors where ADB has limited engagement; and (iv) TA support, coordinated \nacross development partners and provided parallel to budget support programs, can help push \nthe  reform  agenda.  Another  key  lesson  is  that  a  3-year  program  can  involve  significant \nimplementation challenges, given high rates of turnover (both within the civil service and at the \nministerial level) and Tonga\u2019s exposure to disruptive external shocks. These challenges became \nevident  in  the  current  program,  originally  expected  to  be  implemented  over  FY2016\u2013FY2018, \nunder which reform priorities were initially established with the authorities in 2015. Since then, a \nchange  in  administration  in  2017,  followed  by  a  major  natural  disaster  in  2018,  have  affected \nprogress  in  some  reform  areas.  Subprogram  3  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  flexibility  in \nadjusting  the  reforms  to  ensure  that  policy  actions  remain  relevant  and  informed  by  the  latest \nevidence and conditions. \n\n                                                \n9  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants is determined by its risk of debt distress. Since Tonga is at \n\nhigh risk of debt distress, it is eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants.  \n\n10 The two loans from the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, signed in FY2009 and FY2010, are valued at $70 million and \n$45 million. Instead of FY2019\u2013FY2024 and FY2020\u2013FY2025, the principal repayment periods for each loan will now \nbe FY2024\u2013FY2029 and FY2025\u2013FY2030 respectively. \n\n11 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase III. Manila. \n12 Following a decrease in the return on equity of Tonga\u2019s SOE portfolio from about 5.6% in FY2006 to 0.1% in FY2009, \nADB-supported measures helped increase the return to 4.0% in FY2016, based on latest available data (footnote 5). \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nB. \n \n12. \nGovernment  reforms.  Tonga  has  adopted  a  vision  for  \u201ca  more  progressive  Tonga \nsupporting a higher quality of life for all,\u201d following the Tonga Strategic Development Framework \n(TSDF),  2015\u20132025. 13 This  vision  is  translated  into  five  pillars:  economic  institutions,  social \ninstitutions,  political  institutions,  infrastructure  and  technology,  and  environment.  The  TSDF \nemphasizes sustainability, good governance, shared prosperity, and gender equality. \n \nPartner  coordination.  Since  2011,  the  government  has  prioritized  and  sequenced \n13. \nreforms  through  the  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM)  process,  which  brings  together  key \nministries and development partners to map out critical constraints, design policy and TA solutions, \nmonitor  reform  implementation,  and  mobilize  financial  assistance.14 ADB,  the  governments  of \nAustralia and  New  Zealand, the  European  Union,  and the World  Bank  coordinate  their  budget \nsupport and/or TA operations through the JPRM process. The IMF has provided an assessment \nletter for the grant.15 \n \nProgrammatic approach. ADB\u2019s Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program supports \n14. \ngovernment reforms through three subprograms, originally envisaged for FY2016\u2013FY2018.16 The \nprogrammatic design allows for reform sequencing across multiple areas to account for Tonga\u2019s \nlimited implementation capacity, while providing flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities \nand  constraints.  ADB  developed  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  in  consultation  with  the \ngovernment  and  other  development  partners,  and  in  alignment  with  national  priorities.  All  the \npolicy actions set out under subprograms 1 and 2 were completed in FY2016 and FY2017,17 and \nsupported reforms focused on fiscal consolidation, PFM, and improving the business environment. \n \n15. \nFollowing Cyclone Gita, which hit Tonga on 12\u201313 February 2018, the government\u2019s focus \nshifted to response, recovery, and reconstruction. To meet the government\u2019s revised priorities in \nthe  aftermath  of  the  cyclone,  ADB  disbursed  $6.0  million  in  disaster-contingent  financing  on \n16 February  2018  from  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program. 18 On  22  February,  ADB \nprovided an additional $1 million under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund for humanitarian \nrelief  efforts.  Subsequently,  in  June  2018,  ADB  approved  a  $6.8  million  grant  for  the \nreconstruction and upgrade of electricity network infrastructure damaged by the cyclone.19 \n \n16. \nAlthough the reform momentum was interrupted in FY2018, continuation of the program \nis appropriate given the progress achieved under the first two subprograms, the need to focus on \nimplementation, the new government\u2019s commitment to the JPRM, and the importance of budget \nsupport.  Under  subprogram  2,  nine  indicative  triggers  for  subprogram  3  were  identified \n(footnote 17), in line with government priorities and capacity.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loans, \n\nPolicy-Based Grants, and Technical Assistance Grant for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program. Manila. \n\n19 ADB. 2018. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Kingdom \n\nof Tonga for the Cyclone Gita Recovery Project. Manila. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\non the evolution of reform priorities and context led to some changes during the preparation of \nsubprogram 3. Two indicative triggers were dropped from subprogram 3 as they are only feasible \nin the medium term because of delays arising from exogenous factors and issues around partner \nTA  mobilization.20 A  new  indicative  trigger  was  added,  reflecting  revised  priorities.  Eight  prior \nactions were finalized for subprogram 3. The program will close on 30 June 2019. \n \n17. \nProgram  description.  The  program  aligns  with  the  following  TSDF  impacts:  (i)  more \ninclusive and sustainable growth and development; (ii) a more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic \nknowledge-based economy; and (iii) more responsive good governance (footnote 13). The effect \nof the reforms will be an improved fiscal position and business environment in Tonga. Eight prior \nactions under three reform areas have been completed under subprogram 3 (Appendix 4). ADB \nhas added value through TA support for five prior actions, as outlined below. \n \n18. \nReform area 1: Fiscal resilience. Policy actions completed under subprograms 1 and 2 \nincluded measures to strengthen tax revenue mobilization (primarily taxes on unhealthy foods) \nand develop a fiscal strategy with medium-term targets for debt, revenue, and public service wage \naffordability. The government conducted a civil service remuneration review under subprogram 1. \nBased on this review, under subprogram 2, the government introduced a new public service salary \nstructure with a revised pay scale for fair and appropriate remuneration, along with a performance \nmanagement system (PMS) for competitive and fair performance assessments as a basis for in-\ngrade pay progression rather than automatic increments for public officials starting in 2018. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTax administration. Since 80% of Tonga\u2019s tax revenues come from consumption \nand  trade  taxes,  maximizing  the  efficiency  of  tax  and  customs  administration  is \ncrucial. As a subprogram 3 prior action, the cabinet approved a revised revenue \nservices administration bill that introduces additional avenues for revenue recovery \nand  sets  updated  and  graduated  penalties  to  incentivize  compliance. 21  The \nlegislation  obligates  taxpayers  to  apply  for  a  tax  identification  number,  which  is \nexpected  to  improve  compliance  management.  As  another  subprogram  3  prior \naction, the cabinet approved a new customs bill that ensures that national rules \nare  consistent  with  key  international  standards  (including  the  Revised  Kyoto \nConvention  and  World  Customs  Organization  recommended  practices)  and \nimproves  customs  administration.  The  reforms  will  standardize  and  simplify \ndeclaration  procedures  and  supporting  documentation,  clarify  principles  for \ncustoms  valuation  of  imported  goods,  and  enhance  the  predictability  and \ntransparency of customs actions. They will also reduce documentary compliance \ncosts by facilitating the online access and lodgment of documents, payments, and \ncustoms  clearance.  These  bills  will  be  implemented  following  Parliamentary \napproval expected in 2019, and implementation regulations are under preparation. \nCivil service reforms. The public sector wage bill, about 56% of FY2018 domestic \nrevenue, remains a major fiscal challenge. To continue reforms in this area, the \ngovernment requested an assessment of PMS implementation introduced under \nsubprogram 2.  A review  was undertaken  through  ADB TA.22 While commending \nthe Public Service Commission for undertaking potentially contentious reforms in \na  very  competent  manner,  the  review  made  17  recommendations  to  strengthen \n\n                                                \n20 Indicative Triggers and Policy Actions Accomplished for Subprogram 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2) summarizes the changes in the policy actions for subprogram 3. \n\n21 Penalties related to tax administration (i.e., registration, late lodgment and payment, false or misleading statements, \nand dishonored checks) and tax offences (i.e., failure to maintain proper records, fraud, and obstruction) are clearly \ndefined, and graduated penalties (i.e., where the penalty increases, depending on the severity and/or length of time \nof the infraction) have been introduced for several offences to encourage compliance. \n22 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (Phase 2). Manila. \n\n \n\n\fand  streamline  the  PMS,  which  the  cabinet  considered  in  August  2018.  As  a \nsubprogram 3 prior action, the Public Service Commission implemented three key \nrecommendations:  (a)  realignment  of  the  PMS  year  to  de-link  it  from  the  peak \nperiods of activity in the budget cycle, ensuring that management and staff have \nsufficient  time  to  complete  the  performance  assessment  process  adequately; \n(b) provision of target performance rating distributions to ministries to reduce the \nneed  for  substantial  moderation  by  the  Oversight  Moderation  Committee  of \nperformance \nratings;  and \n(c) clarification of eligibility for performance rewards and procedures for managing \npoor performance. \n\nratings  heavily  skewed \n\nthe  highest \n\ntoward \n\n  \n19. \nReform  area  2:  An  inclusive,  modern,  and  accountable  state.  Policy  actions  under \nsubprogram  1  included  the  approval  of  new  public  procurement  regulations  and  PFM \nimprovements,  such  as  audit  follow-up  procedures  (footnote  8).  A  procurement  database \nintroduced under subprogram 2 established an institutional mechanism to enable the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) to maintain a detailed record of all procurements above the small item threshold \n(T$7,500) and to monitor key performance indicators on procurement, which can help the MOF \nidentify  bottlenecks  in  the  procurement  process.  An  independent  regulator  with  powers  to \nregulate communication services was also established under subprogram 1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfor  national  celebrations),  undermining \n\nFinancial management. As a subprogram 3 prior action, the MOF has removed \nthe noneconomic items from the economic segment of the chart of accounts (COA), \nwhich will improve the accuracy of budget reporting. A comprehensive economic \nsegment is critical to the government\u2019s reporting requirements\u2014classifying items \nas revenues, expenditures, assets, or liabilities, and assigning these into standard \ncategories such as salaries, goods and services, and capital investment. In Tonga, \nthe integrity of the economic segment had been compromised by the inclusion of \nnoneconomic  concepts,  e.g.,  items  related  to  projects,  programs,  funds,  or \nactivities  (such  as  spending \nthe \neffectiveness of budget controls and presenting risks of inaccurate or misclassified \ninformation.  The  IMF\u2019s  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  supported \nthe  removal  of  noneconomic  items  from  the  COA.  In  parallel,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  are  providing  TA  for  the  upgrade  of  Tonga\u2019s  financial \nmanagement information system (footnote 22), with the addition of new modules \nfor  aid  information,  project  management,  budget  preparation,  and  forecasting, \nwhich will be impacted by changes to the COA. Further revisions to the COA will \nbe  implemented  concurrently  with  the  finalization  of  the  financial  management \ninformation system upgrade in 2019 to ensure compatibility. \nLabor market regulations. A policy objective under the program is to improve the \nfunctioning of the labor market, which can in turn promote inclusive growth. Tonga \nlacked  labor  regulation  in  the  private  sector  to  ensure  many  standard  basic \nprotections,  including  rights  to  leave  from  work,  nondiscrimination,  and  fair \ndismissal.  The  absence  of  flexible  work  arrangements  and  maternity  leave \nentitlements affected women disproportionately. As a subprogram 3 prior action, \nthe  cabinet  approved  for  submission  to  Parliament  a  landmark  employment \nrelations bill (ERB), which will ensure basic labor protections and reduce gender \ndisparities at work. This legislation, prepared with assistance from the International \nLabour Organization, has been widely consulted with stakeholders over more than \nfive years. It reflects key issues and priorities from consultations with women and \nwomen\u2019s organizations and includes a new entitlement for maternity leave, as well \nas legislative backing for new fundamental rights such as equal pay for equal work, \nfreedom of association, and prohibition of forced labor. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fReform  area  3:  A  more  dynamic  and  inclusive  economy.  Business  environment \n20. \nreforms under subprograms 1 and 2 included public enterprise governance improvements, and \nsteps  toward  the  commercialization  of  Tonga  Water  Board,  Tonga  Cable  Limited,  and  Tonga \nCommunications Corporation. Under subprogram 2, the cabinet approved a foreign investment \nbill to attract foreign investment. Progressive implementation of government initiatives has helped \nincrease the profitability of the SOE portfolio (footnote 5). \n\n7 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nForeign  investment. The Foreign Investment  Act  was  passed  by  Parliament  in \n2019  after  extensive consultation, reflecting  work  ongoing  since  2013  with ADB \nsupport  (footnote  11).  Replacing  the  2002  Foreign  Investment  Act,  the  new  act \n(a) clarifies the definition of foreign investment, (b) provides clearer principles for \nreviewing reserved and restricted  activities, and (c) sets out a more transparent \nframework for screening foreign investment applications. As a subprogram 3 prior \naction,  the  cabinet  approved  revised foreign investment  regulations,23 subject to \nformal enactment of the 2019 Foreign Investment Act.24 The new regulations will \nhelp ensure that the foreign investment registration process is simpler, streamlined, \nand clearer about information requirements. \nPublic enterprises. Subprogram 3 continued successful reforms to improve the \nfinancial  viability  of  selected  SOEs.  Currently,  stevedoring  (cargo  handling) \nactivities at Nuku\u2019alofa port are fragmented, with three private stevedores aligned \nto  separate  shipping  lines  but  drawing  on  the  same  small  labor  pool,  providing \nship-to-shore  handling  of  cargo.  Ports  Authority  Tonga  (PAT)  provides  the \nremaining functions to facilitate container transport to the terminal gate. A review \nconducted  with  ADB  TA  (footnote 11)  noted  that  a  single  operator  providing \nseamless  cargo  handling  services  from  ship  to  terminal  gate  would  lead  to \nefficiency  gains  in  port  operations,  and  allow  greater  incentives  to  invest  in \nequipment  and staff.  As  a  subprogram  3  prior  action,  the  cabinet  approved  that \nPAT will issue a concession contract for all cargo handling activities at Nuku\u2019alofa \nport to be provided by a single private sector operator, with PAT acting as the port \nlandlord.  PAT  will  no  longer  incur  ongoing  operation  and  maintenance  costs \nassociated with cargo handling, while collecting a concession fee from the private \noperator. PAT will issue a competitive tender for a concession contract to provide \nstevedoring and  related services at the  port.  The  28  PAT  employees  potentially \naffected by the transition have been offered the option of employment with the new \nconcessionaire  or  a  redundancy  package,  limiting  employment  impacts.  The \nMinistry  of  Public  Enterprises,  with  ADB  support,  aims  to  sign  a  concession \nagreement with a private company in 2019. \nPrivate  sector  development.  As  a  subprogram  3  prior  action,  the  cabinet \napproved  a  private  sector  development  strategy, 25 setting  out  a  prioritized  and \nsequenced list of gender-sensitive reforms\u2014addressing the business environment, \nmarket competition, access to finance, targeted business development, and public \nenterprises. The strategy was prepared with ADB support (footnote 11), with input \nfrom  women  and  women\u2019s  organizations.  It  includes  recommendations  that \naddress the challenges faced by women, such as measures to improve access to \nfinance  and  financial  literacy;  support  tourism-related  industries,  which  are \ndominated by women; and create more employment opportunities for women by \n\n                                                \n23 Regulations include processes, templates, and instructions for (i) registration as a foreign investor; (ii) reissuance, \nreinstatement, or transfer of registration; (iii) submission of annual reports; and (iv) cessation of business activity. A \nlist of reserved and restricted activities is also part of the regulations. \n\n24 Enactment follows assent by the King of Tonga, which will formally bring the 2019 Foreign Investment Act into effect. \n25 This action was originally part of subprogram 1, but was postponed  because the limited development partner TA \n\nresources were re-prioritized to support other reforms.  \n\n \n\n\fcontracting out government services such as home health care. The strategy also \naddresses the needs of disabled and young people in training and employment. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \n21. \nReform  area  4:  Effective  response  to  disasters.  The  program  originally  included  a \nreform area for effective disaster response. Subprogram 1 supported a response plan to Cyclone \nWinston. This reform area was not part of subprograms 2 and 3, and ADB\u2019s support for disaster \nresilience reforms is provided outside of the program framework (footnote 18). \n  \nC. \n \n22. \nSubprogram  3  reforms  build  on  good  progress  under  the  two  earlier  subprograms  to \nstrengthen Tonga\u2019s macroeconomic resilience and ability to respond to economic shocks. Under \nreform  area  1  (para.  18),  more  efficient  customs  administration  and  indirect  tax  collection  will \nfurther  enhance  domestic  revenue  mobilization  (including  through  better  compliance),26 and  a \ndeclining wage bill in the medium term will improve the fiscal position. These reforms can help \nbuild fiscal space to respond to economic shocks and disasters, and promote long-term growth. \nEnvisaged  reform  impacts  also  include  allocative  efficiency  gains  from  the  rebalancing  of \nexpenditure  to  priority  areas.  Under  reform  area  2  (para.  19),  financial  management \nimprovements  will  help  the  government  to  monitor  budget  spending  and  strengthen  internal \ncontrols  more  systematically.  Under  reform  area  3  (para.  20),  clarity  about  foreign  investment \nregistration  requirements  will  reduce  uncertainty  about  application  review  and  screening, \nencouraging foreign investors. More efficient SOEs will lead to less demand for government fiscal \nsupport.  Implementation  of  the  private  sector  development  strategy  will  improve  the  business \nenvironment, which will help create more jobs and promote growth. \n  \nD. \n \n23. \nExcluding grants, the fiscal deficit in FY2019 is estimated to be $107.6 million (23.2% of \nGDP). FY2019 grants are estimated to total $102.0 million, of which $15.5 million is through the \nJPRM. Of this amount, ADB is expected to contribute $5.0 million. JPRM budget support grants \nalso include $2.2 million from the European Union, $2.8 million from the Government of Australia, \nand $5.5 million from the World Bank, as parallel collaborative partner financing not administered \nby ADB.27 JPRM budget support will finance 14.4% of the FY2019 projected fiscal deficit. \n \n24. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $5.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance subprogram 3. The grant proceeds \nwill support development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.28  \n \nE. \n \nThe existing institutional structure for aid management in Tonga will be used to implement \n25. \nand monitor the policy actions supported by the program. The MOF will be the executing agency. \nThe  government\u2019s  Budget  Support  Management  Committee,  which  leads  the  JPRM  process, \noversees  the  program.  Through  the  committee,  the  MOF  will  provide  overall  guidance  and \nassume responsibility for coordinating program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation as the \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n26 Reforms under the program helped raise the tax\u2013GDP ratio in Tonga to an estimated 21.1% in FY2018, higher than \n\nthe Pacific average of 18.1% (Table 1). \n\n27 The World Bank\u2019s policy matrix for its parallel Third Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, expected to be \napproved in May 2019, supports seven of the eight prior actions in ADB\u2019s subprogram 3 policy matrix. The action on \ncabinet approval of the private sector development strategy (para. 20) appears only in the ADB matrix. \n\n28 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nexecuting  agency.  The  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Economic  Development,  the  Ministry  of  Public \nEnterprises, the Ministry of Revenue and Customs, the Public Service Commission, and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Office  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  JPRM  process  will  continue  to  facilitate \nbroad  consultations  on  reform  priorities.  Government  authorities  have  consulted  on  individual \nreform  initiatives,  with  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  as  needed. 29  Subprogram  3  is \nimplemented from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2019, extended by a year because of external events \n(para. 11). The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, following \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n26. \nGovernance. Promoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is \nimplementing its PFM reform road map, FY2015\u2013FY2019, to close the gaps identified through \ntwo PFM assessments.30 Despite capacity limitations, the assessments indicate that, compared \nwith international best practice, Tonga\u2019s PFM system is mostly operating at average levels. The \ngovernment  has  the  ability  to  implement  its  budget  but  there  are  procurement,  accounting, \nfinancial  reporting,  and  auditing  weaknesses  (footnote  3).  This  program,  complemented  by \ndevelopment partner TA (para. 19 and footnote 8), addresses many of those weaknesses. Tonga \nhas  taken  steps  to  strengthen  anticorruption  measures,  including  by  creating  the  Parliament \nStanding Committee on Anti-Corruption in 2015. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the MOF and the government. \n \n27. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  public  sector  is  a  key  provider  of  services  to  low-income \nhouseholds, and reform area 1 will help ensure that the government has the fiscal resources to \nrespond to future economic shocks and natural disasters (which tend to have an adverse effect \non the poor) while maintaining critical public services. Reform area 2 will improve work conditions \nfor  all  employees,  to  the  extent  that  basic  labor  rights  are  protected  by  law  once  the  ERB  is \nenacted. The ERB provides the legal framework to establish minimum wages in the future, which \ncould  have  negative  employment  consequences.  However,  the  ERB  also  stipulates  that  any \nminimum  wage  must  be  endorsed  by  representatives  from  the  government,  employers\u2019 \norganizations,  workers\u2019  associations,  and  the  Forum  of  Directors  of  Education.  Given  such \nmitigating measures, the ERB is considered supportive of vulnerable groups by protecting basic \nlabor  rights  and  protections  that  are  already  standard  in  many  countries.  Reform  area  3  will \nimprove the environment for private sector activity, which will help create more jobs in Tonga. \n \n28. \nGender.  Subprogram  3  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  includes \nproactive  gender  actions  that  will  address  a  number  of  constraints  to  women\u2019s  labor  force \nparticipation and economic empowerment. The ERB (para. 19) addresses key legislative barriers \nto women\u2019s employment by providing new fundamental rights for women in the labor market. New \nprovisions for flexible work arrangements and maternity leave entitlements will support women\u2019s \nadvancement in the workplace; and ensure that women returning from maternity leave face no \nloss of wages, benefits, or seniority. In addition, legislation on freedom from discrimination and \nequal  remuneration  for  equal  work  will  help  to  address  wage  discrimination  and  sexual \nharassment in the workplace. The approval of the private sector development strategy (para. 20) \nwill  lead  to  concrete  steps  to  improve  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  private  sector,  including \nmeasures  to  improve  access  to  finance  and  financial  literacy;  employment  opportunities  for \n                                                \n29 Extensive consultations have been undertaken around foreign investment legislation, the ERB, and the private sector \n\ndevelopment strategy. \n\n30 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability. 2010.

Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  3  is \nclassified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed, and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n30. \nRisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.32 Development  partners  assess  that \nPFM  systems  can  support  mostly  reliable  services  for  budget  support.  Policy  reforms  and  TA \nsupport  address  remaining  fiduciary  risks  (para.  26).  The  program\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nHigh staff turnover aggravates existing capacity \nconstraints, which delays reform implementation \nand impedes policy reform coordination and \nformulation among key government agencies. \nExternal shocks undermine the fiscal position \nand growth, and divert political and \nadministrative attention and capacity away from \nreforms. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nReforms are prioritized and sequenced to avoid overburdening the \nsmall public administration and decision makers. Technical \nassistance will be mobilized by development partners on a needs \nbasis to supplement capacity. \nReforms that promote domestic revenue mobilization, lead to a \nlower wage bill, and enhance efficiency of public enterprises will \nhelp create fiscal space to respond to shocks. The government will \nseek development partner assistance in case of disasters. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n31. \nThe government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  grant  document.  The  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for \nsubprogram 3, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n32. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $5,000,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) for subprogram 3 of the Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program, \non terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 May 2019 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nMore inclusive and sustainable growth and development attained (Tonga Strategic Development \nFramework, 2015\u20132025)a \nA more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy promoted (Tonga Strategic \nDevelopment Framework, 2015\u20132025)a \nMore responsive good governance achieved (Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025)a \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators with  \nTargets and Baselines \n\nProgrammatic approach \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n\n \n\nRisks \n\n \n \na.

The JPRM is a living document that is updated based on government priorities and \nthe reform context. The JPRM guides the overall reforms undertaken by the government. Not all actions in the JPRM \nare prior policy actions for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s budget support operations. However, the policy actions in \nsubprogram 3 are a subset of the JPRM actions. \n\nc  The employment relations bill includes a new entitlement for maternity leave; provisions for equal pay for equal work, \nflexible  working,  freedom  of  association,  and  prohibition  of  forced  labor;  and  legislation  on  freedom  from \ndiscrimination and harassment in the workplace. \n\nd   The private sector development strategy includes recommendations to (i) review women\u2019s constraints to land tenure, \n(ii) improve women\u2019s access to finance and financial literacy programs, and (iii) increase employment opportunities \nfor women in the service industry. \n\ne  Development partners support several policy reforms across all three reform areas, which are necessary to reach \nthe outcome, as outlined in the JPRM (footnote 14 of the main text). Joint partner engagement in reform dialogue \nand technical assistance and advisory across all three outputs make it unfeasible to split outputs by partner. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s policy matrix for its parallel Third Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, which is expected \nto be approved in May 2019, supports seven of the eight prior actions in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s subprogram 3 \npolicy matrix. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=48361-003-2 \n\nGrant Agreement \nSector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management \nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \nDevelopment Coordination \nCountry Economic Indicators \nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \nList of Ineligible Items \n\n \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n \nSupplementary Documents \n10. \n11. \n12. \n\nOverview of Past and Planned Policy Reform Actions, 2009\u20132019 \nIndicative Triggers and Policy Actions Accomplished for Subprogram 3 \nJoint Policy Reform Matrix, FY2016\u2013FY2019 \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nReform area \n\nPolicy Objectives \n\nI. \n\nSUPPORTING FISCAL RESILIENCE \n\nFiscal strategy \n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nImprove fiscal \nsustainability and \nresilience, and public \nexpenditure \neffectiveness \n\nImprove tax \ncompliance, revenue \ncollection, and \nincentives for \nhealthier living \n\nRevenue \n \n\nPOLICY MATRIX \n\nAll actions for Subprograms 1, 2, and 3 are complete. \n\nSubprogram 1 \nActions Accomplished  \n(FY2016) \n\nSubprogram 2 \nActions Accomplished \n(FY2017) \n\nSubprogram 3 \nActions Accomplished  \n (FY2019) \n\n2.
