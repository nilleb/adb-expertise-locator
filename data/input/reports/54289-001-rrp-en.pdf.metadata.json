This program is critical because \nthe  Cook  Islands  faces  significant  declines  in  international  tourism  and  government  revenue \nbecause of COVID-19.  \n \n3. \n The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.3\n  It is also aligned with the Pacific Approach priorities of managing risks and building \nresilience by strengthening the health sector and social protection.4 The Cook Islands meets all \nthe access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criterion \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\n1.  Adverse \nimpact of \nexogenous \nshocks \n\n2.  Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\n3.  Pre-shock \nrecord of \ngenerally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nThe  Cook  Islands  is  one  of  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  most  tourism-dependent  countries,  with \nreceipts equivalent to 61.4% of GDP in FY2019. With the shutdown of international travel, \nGDP is estimated to have fallen 7.0% in FY2020, after 5.3% growth in FY2019. If borders \nwere to open to tourism in January 2021, the ADB anticipates that GDP will fall a further 15.4% \nin FY2021, with persistent and extreme risks. Tourism-related sectors account for about 2,730 \njobs (or 36.7% of the total workforce). Government revenue is estimated to fall 41% in FY2021 \ncompared to FY2019 levels. Combined with stimulus measures, ADB estimates a fiscal deficit \nof 33.1% of GDP in FY2021, which will exhaust accumulated fiscal reserves by the end of \n2021,  with  the  government  possibly  needing  to  undertake  fiscal  consolidation.  Of  the \npopulation,  8.4%  falls  below  the  basic  needs  poverty  line,  with  13.6%  categorized  as \nvulnerable.  The  crisis  is  expected  to  reverse  poverty  gains,  especially  if  job  losses  are \nrealized. \n\nThe ERP is a comprehensive government stimulus program, financed in two phases: (i) $28.0 \nmillion  (8.6%  of  GDP)  for  FY2020,  and  (ii)  $59.0  million  (20.9%  of  GDP)  for  FY2021.  It \nprovides support for the health system, payments for employment support, tax and credit relief \nfor businesses, free or subsidized re-training, cash support to poor and vulnerable households \nand those required to self-isolate, countercyclical private sector lending, and electricity tariff \ndiscounting. The COVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020, a time-bound (5 years) piece of \nlegislation, was passed to allow the government\u2019s credit initiatives within the ERP to proceed. \n\nPrior  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Cook  Islands  was  implementing  sound  economic \npolicies. Between FY2016 and FY2019, the fiscal surplus averaged 5.7% of GDP, and GDP \ngrowth averaged 6.7%. Fiscal surpluses enabled fiscal buffers: the Stabilisation Account of \nNZ$56.7 million (11.4% of FY2020 GDP prior to COVID-19) and the Loan Reserve Fund to \nsmooth debt servicing (NZ$21.4 million, about 2 years\u2019 worth of debt servicing). Government \nrevenue performed strongly following tax reforms in 2014, increasing from 39.1% of GDP in \nFY2016 to 41.0% in FY2019. Expenditure has been largely contained, averaging 37.5% of \nGDP over FY2016\u2013FY2019. Net debt fell from 26.4% of GDP in FY2016 to 16.9% in FY2020.a \n\n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

The Cook \nIslands  Emergency  Response  Plan  to  COVID-19  laid  out  a  pandemic  preparedness  and \nmanagement plan. MOH activated its Health Emergency Response system on 22 January \n2020, denying entry to travelers from affected countries, and the border was closed on 24 \nMarch. A mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions, and \nsocial distancing were enforced during a lockdown period. Widespread testing began in mid-\nMarch,  with  the  Cook  Islands  declaring  itself  COVID-19  free  on  16  April  2020.  Lockdown \nrestrictions were relaxed on 20 April, but border control measures were maintained because \nof the risk of COVID-19 community transmission in major tourist markets. MOH has indicated \nthat it will likely continue and expand the community-based health services that began during \nthe  COVID-19  response,  as  well  as  improvements  to  mental  health  services  and  possible \nlong-term reforms to eldercare and disability care. \n\nThe Cook Islands is a group C country and was not rated high risk of debt distress prior to the \npandemic,  but  it  suffers  similar  issues  to  other  Pacific  small  island  states  because  of  its \nvulnerability and narrow economic base. Following COVID-19, drawdowns of fiscal buffers \nwill be complemented by debt financing from ADB and AIIB (combined 14.2% of GDP) and \nwill  increase  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  from  16.9%  in  FY2020 to  a  peak  of  43.8% in  FY2021, \nabove the government debt ceiling of 35.0%. An ADB DSA assesses that under this program \nthe  Cook  Islands  is  in  a  sustainable  debt  position  over  the  medium  term,  with  net  debt \nreaching 35% in FY2024. \n\n6.  Coordination \nwith the IMF \n\nADB  undertook  a  macroeconomic  assessment  and  DSA  since  the  Cook  Islands  is  not  a \nmember of the IMF.

The Cook Islands consists of 15 islands with a land area of 67 \n4. \nsquare kilometers, spread across 2 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. Almost \n80% of the population of 17,434 in 2020 resides in Rarotonga. The shift in economic structure \ntoward tourism since the late 1990s has led to rapid development, with basic needs poverty falling \nfrom 28.4% in 2006 to 8.4% by 2016. The Cook Islands is one of the smallest and most remote \nnations in the Pacific Ocean, with high cost structures and limited natural resources. The economy \nremains  heavily  dependent  on  international  trade  (including  tourism);  and  future  growth  is \nhampered by disproportionately expensive public administration and infrastructure costs, a small \npopulation, and high exposure to disaster and climate risks. The Cook Islands is not a member of \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  or  the  World  Bank,  so  it  has  limited  access  to  external \nsupport.  \n \nPreemptive  health  response.  The  Cook  Islands  has  avoided  a  COVID-19  outbreak \n5. \nwithin  its  borders.  With  the  global  outbreak  of  the  pandemic,  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH) \nactivated the Health Emergency Response System in January 2020.5 Following the progressive \ntightening of controls, including ceasing domestic travel, the border was completely closed to non-\nresidents  on  24  March  (Table  1).  On  the  same  day,  a  mandatory  14-day  quarantine  was \n\n5 MOH is also referred to as Te Marae Ora. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nimplemented for incoming residents, schools were closed, and social distancing was enforced.6 \nWidespread testing began in mid-March, and the Cook Islands declared itself free of COVID-19 \non 16 April. Domestic controls have been relaxed, but the border remains closed.  \n \n6. \nVulnerable  health  system.  The  high  prevalence  of  hypertension,  diabetes,  and \ncardiovascular  diseases  in  the  Cook  Islands  makes  it  more  vulnerable  to  COVID-19.  The \nRarotonga Hospital, the nation\u2019s main health facility, has a capacity of about 170 beds, with 32 \nrepurposed  into  an  isolation  ward  for  potential  COVID-19  cases.  The  estimated  potential \nrequirement  for  hospital  beds  is  about  double  the  current  capacity,  and  there  are  only  three \nventilators.7 Hotels have been identified to provide screening and quarantine, and there is one \nGeneXpert  machine  for  processing  COVID-19  tests  (although  most  tests  are  sent  to  New \nZealand). Health care is publicly funded, with services provided for free or for nominal fees. The \nskilled  health  professionals  density  of  7.0  per  1,000  population  is  above  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal minimum threshold of 4.45 per 1,000 population, but it relies on rotational staff \nfrom New Zealand for acute care and surgical services. These services are presently on hold, \nadding  to  the  pressure  on  health  workers.  The  majority  of  the  health  care  workforce  has  had \nadditional training in pandemic response, but the high infection rate of COVID-19 could rapidly \ndeplete the workforce.  \n\n \n7. \nTourism  significantly  affected.  The  Cook  Islands  is  among  the  most  tourism-driven \neconomies  in  the  Pacific  region,  with  tourism  receipts  equivalent  to  61.4%  of  annual  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in FY2019. New Zealand is the primary tourism market, accounting for \n67%  of  FY2019  arrivals.  The  economy  enjoyed  sustained  growth  averaging  4.9%  of  GDP \nbetween FY2012 and FY2019 as visitor arrivals rose from 113,129 in 2011 to a peak of 171,550 \nin 2019. From July 2019 to February 2020, visitor arrivals were 5.3% higher than the same period \nin  the  previous  year.  However,  with  borders  closed  to  non-residents  since  March  2020,  visitor \narrivals  have  fallen  to  almost  zero.  The  Cook  Islands\u2019  economic  trajectory  is  tied  to  efforts  to \nreopen its border with New Zealand. With closed borders, the potential impacts on livelihoods and \nbusinesses are severe even with government stimulus; each month that the border is closed, the \neconomy is estimated to lose an additional 3% of its annual GDP.8 Since there is no central bank, \nthe banking sector relies on public sector liquidity, with a fiscal crisis likely to be exacerbated by \na  financial  crisis  if  public  reserves  are  depleted  before  economic  recovery  takes  hold.  Supply \ndisruptions have impacted imports, but local value chains are largely tied to tourism activity. \n \n8. \nUnprecedented  economic  losses.  ADB  estimates  that  GDP  fell  7.0%  in  FY2020 \nbecause of the impact of COVID-19 on visitor arrivals in the fourth quarter, a dramatic turnaround \nfrom the 4.5% growth projected in December 2019.9 Even if the border were to open to tourism \nin January 2021, ADB estimates that GDP would fall a further 15.4% in FY2021, despite extensive \ngovernment stimulus efforts. The decline would be the largest in Cook Islands\u2019 history, negatively \nimpacting employment, business viability, government finances, and social wellbeing.  \n \n9. \nPre-shock record of sound economic management. Over FY2016\u2013FY2019, the fiscal \nsurplus averaged 5.7% (Table 2). Revenue performed strongly, especially following tax reforms \nin 2014, with domestic revenue increasing from 39.1% of GDP in FY2016 to 41.0% of GDP in \n\n \n\n6  All  mass  gathering  events  were  cancelled,  including  church,  sports,  and  social  gatherings  outside  of  immediate \nhouseholds. To safely socially distance at shops, customer limits were recommended, and restrictions were placed \non children being in stores. \n\n7  Projections based on the Cook Islands\u2019 population of 17,434 with a 10% infection rate given current preparedness \n\nmeasures; 20% of those infected will require hospitalization, and 5% will be severe and require ventilators. \n\n8  ADB. 2020.

Expenditure has been largely contained, averaging 37.5% of GDP over FY2016\u2013FY2019. \nThe successive fiscal surpluses since FY2016 have enabled the creation of fiscal buffers in the \nStabilisation Account, which reached 11.4% of GDP in FY2020 prior to COVID-19, and the Loan \nReserve Fund (a sinking fund) of 4.3% of GDP to smooth debt servicing requirements and aid in \nbetter cash management. Debt financing is used predominantly for infrastructure investment, has \nbeen low and stable, and was 16.7% of GDP in FY2019 after accounting for prepayments.  \n \n\nTable 2: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n\nFY2018 \n8.9 \n0.1 \n \n44.8 \n43.0 \n27.2 \n15.8 \n1.8 \n43.4 \n31.3 \n13.8 \n12.2 \n1.4 \n(0.4) \n18.5 \n369.1 \n\nFY2017 \n6.8 \n(0.1) \n \n47.9 \n44.9 \n31.5 \n13.4 \n3.0 \n35.4 \n28.1 \n13.8 \n7.4 \n12.5 \n9.5 \n17.3 \n325.7 \n\nFY2016 \n6.0 \n(0.1) \n \n39.1 \n35.6 \n29.4 \n6.2 \n3.5 \n35.4 \n29.5 \n13.8 \n5.9 \n3.7 \n0.1 \n26.4 \n291.1 \n\nFY2020e \n(7.0) \n1.5 \n \n44.4 \n40.1 \n28.2 \n11.9 \n4.3 \n49.5 \n41.8 \n13.7 \n7.8 \n(5.1) \n(9.4) \n16.9 \n313.6 \n\nFY2021p \n(15.4) \n1.7 \n \n39.7 \n30.9 \n21.2 \n9.7 \n8.8 \n72.7 \n63.0 \n16.6 \n9.9 \n(33.1) \n(41.8) \n43.8 \n282.5 \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth (% change) \nInflation (% annual change) \nCentral government budget \nTotal revenue and grants  \n  Total revenue  \n    of which: tax revenue  \n  Nontax revenue \n  Grants  \nTotal expenditure \n  Current expenditure  \n    of which: wages and salaries \n  Capital expenditure \nFiscal balance \n  Excluding grants \nPublic net debt  \nNominal GDP ($ million, current prices) \n\nFY2019 \n5.3 \n0.8 \n \n41.0 \n39.6 \n29.5 \n10.1 \n1.4 \n35.9 \n29.2 \n11.0 \n6.7 \n5.1 \n3.7 \n16.7 \n359.2 \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources:  Cook  Islands  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  FY2020/2021  Budget,  Asian  Development \nOutlook database, and Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n10. \nSharp reversal of fiscal performance. The collapse of the tourism industry will have a \ndramatic impact on government tax collection (71.9% of total government revenue in FY2019). \nAfter falling to 28.2% of GDP in FY2020, tax receipts are estimated to decline to 21.2% of GDP \nin FY2021. Expenditure is expected to grow from 49.5% of GDP in FY2020 to 72.7% of GDP in \nFY2021  because  of the countercyclical  expenditure  program.  The fiscal deficit  of  $16.0 million \n(5.1% of GDP) in FY2020 was largely funded by government cash reserves, but the $93.4 million \ndeficit (33.1% of GDP) in FY2021 will require debt financing to avoid placing extreme pressure on \ngovernment cash reserves. The ADB anticipates the borrowing required to sharply increase public \nnet debt from the equivalent of 16.7% of GDP in FY2019 to 43.8% by the end of FY2021. \n \nPressure  on jobs  and household incomes.  The  latest  available  data shows tourism-\n11. \nrelated  sectors  accounted  for  2,729  jobs  in  2016  (36.7%  of  the  total  workforce),  representing \nabout  half  of  all  non-public  sector  employment,  including  informal  labor. 10 The  public  sector \naccounted for a further 26.5% of the workforce, with other retail services (17.0%) and construction, \nmanufacturing, and utilities (10.1%) making up most of the remainder. The Cook Islands has high \nformal employment, with only between 4.3% and 12.4% of the total workforce engaged in informal \nwork. Women comprise 60.5% of tourism-related jobs, and the sector accounts for 63.3% of all \njobs held by women. With tourism-related jobs at risk, there is a risk of substantial development \nprogress unwinding. The 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey estimates that 8.4% \nof the population falls below the basic needs poverty line, down from 28.4% in 2006. A further \n13.6% of the population was defined as vulnerable in 2016, falling from 40.0% in 2006.11 With \n\n10  Cook Islands Government. 2016. Cook Islands 2016 Census of Population and Housing. Rarotonga.  \n11  Food poverty is defined as not being able to reach 2,100 calories a day; basic needs poverty is defined as less than \n$1.90  per  day;  and  vulnerable  is  defined  as  income  within  20%  of  basic  needs  poverty.  Baseline  estimates  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nCOVID-19 likely to reduce incomes below the 2016 level, it is estimated that vulnerable persons \nwill  increase  to  above  15%  of  the  population  and  basic  needs  poverty  will  increase  to  9%  in \n2021.12 Job  losses  will  exacerbate these  effects, with  those  out  of  work  unlikely  to  meet  basic \nneeds, especially in Rarotonga where subsistence alternatives are not universally available. \n \nGender  equality  gains at risk.  In the  event  of COVID-19  infections,  women  are  at  an \n12. \nincreased risk of infection because of their role as frontline health workers and care givers. Indirect \nrisks include worsening health outcomes if essential services, such as maternal and reproductive \nhealth  and  noncommunicable  diseases,  are  de-prioritized.  Socioeconomic  impacts  for  women \ninclude increased poverty from loss of income. Women in the Cook Islands earn 8.0% less than \nmen, work more part-time, and carry more of the burden of unpaid care and household tasks. \nWomen represent 60.5% of the workers in tourism-related businesses. Data pre-pandemic shows \nthat around one-third of all households are headed by women; and that these households, have \nincomes around 18% lower on average than households headed by men. Households headed by \nelderly  women  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  low  income  and  social  isolation,  and  households \nheaded  by  women  face  increased  risk  of  poverty.  The  economic  pressures  of  COVID-19  will \nworsen this. Gender-based  violence  (GBV)  service  providers  have  experienced  an  increase  in \nthe  number  of  domestic  violence  cases  being  reported  since  the  onset  of  COVID-19. 13 The \ncollection and use of sex-disaggregated data are limited.  \n \nComprehensive countercyclical expenditure program. The ERP aims to mitigate the \n13. \nimpacts of COVID-19 on livelihoods and local businesses, including vulnerable households, in a \nway that does not undermine the government\u2019s ability to carry out further fiscal intervention.14 The \nERP is financed in two phases: (i) NZ$42.6 million ($28.0 million, 8.6% of GDP) for FY2020, and \n(ii) NZ$89.7 million ($59.0 million, 20.9% of GDP) for FY2021. The four themes of the ERP are (i) \nCOVID-19  medical  response  and  preparation  (paras.  14\u201315),  (ii)  lifeline  measures  to  support \nlivelihoods through support to households and businesses (paras. 16\u201321), (iii) recovery measures \nthat  can  help  kickstart  growth  (paras.  22\u201323),  and  (iv)  transformation  measures  to  help \nbusinesses (para. 23) (Table 3). \n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Cook Islands Government: COVID-19 Economic Response Plan \n\nCOVID-19 medical response and preparation \nLifeline: supporting livelihoods \nRecovery: kickstarting growth \nTransformation: moving to a smarter, greener economy \nTotal \n(Total in USD) \n\nFY2020 \n(NZ$ million) \n7.3 \n35.3 \n \n \n\n42.6 \n\nFY2021 \n(NZ$ million) \n3.9 \n63.4 \n19.0 \n3.0 \n89.7 \n\n($28.0 million) \n\n($59.0 million) \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, NZ = New Zealand, USD = United States dollar. \nSource: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \nCOVID-19 response and preparation. The government has taken steps to prepare for \n14. \nan outbreak. Frontline health workers, including 120 nurses (110 of whom are women), received \ntraining  on  personal  and  protective  equipment  (PPE),  and  additional  PPE  was  procured  with \ndevelopment  partners,  including  ADB.  Funding  was  allocated  to  converting  excess  hospital \ncapacity into a 32-bed isolation ward with a negative pressure room to cater for potential cases. \nThe  government  also  recognizes  the  indirect  impacts  of  COVID-19,  with  health  workers  and \n\n \n\ndefinitions from the Government of Cook Islands.

A \n24-hour mental health hotline was created alongside a similar service of the Ministry of Education \nfor students, teachers, and families. A network of people qualified to provide mental support also \nconducted  workshops  on  stress  and  anxiety  management,  reaching  up  to  1,300  participants. \nHowever, the sole clinical psychologist at the hospital is overwhelmed with 136 active patients.  \n \n15. \nProtecting non\u2013COVID-19 health care. Disability and eldercare and outpatient services \nhave  been  relocated  from  Rarotonga  Hospital  to  the  main  health  clinic  to  provide  physical \nseparation  from  where  possible  COVID-19  cases  would  be  treated.  Phone-based  health \nconsultations and 24-hour COVID-19 hotline were established. The puna system was activated \nto provide localized access to public health officials, vaccinations, and free general practitioner \nconsultations.16 Pharmaceutical  services  were  conducted  remotely,  with  the  punas  acting  as \ndistribution points to households at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., the elderly). \nMaternal health services have been maintained and made complimentary.17 \n \n16. \nSupporting livelihoods. To protect workers from being laid off, about NZ$30 million is \ntargeted to wage subsidies that allow businesses (including informal businesses) to use staff to \nmaintain  physical  assets  and  improve  the  ability  of  businesses  to  recover  once  tourism \nrecommences. The subsidy is directed to companies that demonstrate a 30% reduction in income \nbetween  March  and  June  2020  and  a  50%  reduction  between  July  and  December  2020.  The \npayments are capped, based on the minimum hourly wage.18 Available data show that about 50% \nof the wage subsidy recipients have been women, who account for 47.6% of the labor force, and \nthat the subsidy supports about 66% of total private sector labor (Table 4).  \n \n\nTable 4: Wage Subsidy Implementation (April\u2013June 2020) \nSubsidy paid \n(NZ$ million) \n3.7 \n3.5 \n3.0 \n\n \nWomen \n1,788 \n1,573 \n1,604 \nSource: The Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n\n \nBusinesses \n407 \n375 \n291 \n\n \nMonth \nApril \nMay \nJune \n\n \nMen \n1,826 \n1,631 \n1,649 \n\n \n \n17. \nTo support those who lose jobs, unemployment benefits were temporarily enacted from \nApril to December 2020. The benefit is open to those above the age of 16 (excluding students \nand  self-employed)  who  have  lost  employment  since  March  2020,  are  actively  seeking \nemployment,  are  ready and  able  to  work,  and  are  not  receiving  the  wage  subsidy  or  business \ngrant. Eligible recipients are paid NZ$266 per week for 4 weeks, with a possible extension of up \nto an additional 2 months at a reduced rate of NZ$150 if recipients can demonstrate a genuine \nattempt to find work and provide written proof of community service, volunteer work, or training \nundertaken. As of August, 138 beneficiaries had received the unemployment benefit; of these, \n58.0%  (80)  are  women  and  16.7%  (23)  are  migrant  workers.  Since  its  inception,  only  28 \n\n \n\n15 The term puna refers to the village system designed for mobilizing emergency response during and after cyclones. \n16  The puna system was developed in 2009 as part of the disaster management system. Rarotonga has 10 punas and \nthe outer islands have their own systems of community organization. The punas are community centers that have \nbeen set up and supported by volunteers from the area and include the secondment of public servants. General \npractitioner visits at the puna health centers are free during a daily 2-hour window or NZ$5 at the health clinic at \nTupapa. All general consultation services at the main hospital have ceased. \n\n17 Migrant workers used to be required to pay a fee.  \n18 Applications and payments are administered by the Cook Islands National Super Fund via an online portal adapted \nfor the purpose, and business eligibility is assessed by the Revenue Management Division of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Management (MFEM) each month. Payments are made electronically to the businesses, which are \nthen responsible for paying their staff as usual, with some additional requirements (e.g., businesses cannot reduce \nwork hours or force staff to utilize their leave entitlements). \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nbeneficiaries  have  applied  for  and  received  the  extension  beyond  the  first  month.19 The  low \nuptake in the unemployment payment is attributed to the wage subsidy effectively holding workers \nin their current positions at higher levels of payments.20 \n \n18. \nSocial assistance. Existing social welfare schemes have been supplemented to support \nlivelihoods.  A  NZ$400  payment  was  made  to  those  who  access  existing  support,  comprising \npensions for residents above the age of 60 (1,809 beneficiaries, 51.8% of whom are women), and \nto  infirm  and  destitute  people  and  caregivers  (362  beneficiaries,  60.2%  of  whom  are  women). \nFamilies can also apply for the Emergency Hardship Fund as a backstop. Applicant families are \nmeans-tested,  and  payments  can  be  taken  in  a  lump-sum  or  spread  across  2  months.21 The \nobligations  are  similar  to  the  unemployment  benefit  (para.  17),  but  they  allow  the  Ministry  of \nInternal  Affairs  more  discretion  in  allowing  for  special  circumstances  (e.g.,  when  someone  is \nphysically unable to work). The fund is available until December 2020.  \n \n19. \nDuring  the  initial  school  closure  period  in  April,  an  additional  NZ$100  was  given  to  the \nfamilies of every school-aged child, in addition to their regular NZ$50 fortnightly payment under \nthe  child  subsidy.  Non-recipients  of  the  existing  child  subsidy  (mainly  non-Cook  Islanders  and \nchildren of migrant workers) could apply for the NZ$100 payment through the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs. This benefit was intended to help families meet the educational requirements during the \nlockdown. A single round of payments targeted 4,742 children; of the payments, 4.4% (209) were \nmade to families of non-Cook Islanders and 47.8% (2,265) were made to the families of girls. \n \n20. \nInterest  relief.  To  remove  a  major  source  of  financial  stress  for  businesses  and \nhouseholds,  an  interest  relief  program  was  introduced  from  July  2020  to  June  2021  at  an \nestimated cost of NZ$14.2 million. The government will provide 70% of the interest cost on all \nexisting debt held in domestic banks, up to NZ$175,000 per business or individual, in the form of \na grant payment to the banks on behalf of the borrower. The program works with the loan deferral \nperiod being offered by the commercial banks and limits the amount of accumulated interest once \nthe  repayment  deferral  period  is  over.  The  payment  will  also  help  avoid  the  accumulation  of \nnonperforming debt in the local financial market.  \n \n21. \nEnsuring  business  continuity.  Businesses  and  sole  traders  (including  in  the  informal \nsector) that can show a 30% decline in revenue compared to pre-crisis levels were eligible for a \none-off payment in April depending on their level of turnover.22 The grants were delivered in April \nto 897 businesses, 314 of which were sole traders and 363 were small businesses in the lowest \nturnover category. A second round of grants for sole traders was issued in July. A collaborative \neffort from the Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement  (MFEM)  resulted  in  about  600  informal  businesses  and  sole  traders  being \nformalized since April to gain access to government support (including the wage subsidy). The \ngovernment  introduced  a  Business  Continuity  Credit  Facility  to  provide  businesses  with \nconcessional short-term liquidity during the downturn.23 Eligibility is based on the wage subsidy \n\n \n\n19 All recipients are required to sign up for the new online employment services portal provided by the government. \n20 Employment  Services  at  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  reported  that  about  200  jobs  have  been  listed  on  the \nhttps://www.employment.gov.ck/ website since its inception, with 40 vacancies posted as of 20 September 2020. \n21 Payments start at NZ$600 lump sum for an individual, with an extra NZ$100 per family member up to NZ$1,000. \n22 Sole traders were eligible for a grant of NZ$3,000, and businesses were eligible for grants of NZ$5,000, NZ$10,000 \nand NZ$15,000 where their respective turnover was under NZ$300,000, under NZ$5 million, or above. Applications \nwere made and assessed using the same process as the wage subsidy, and payments were made via the Cook \nIslands National Super Fund as soon as applications were approved. \n\n23 The facility is authorized under the emergency COVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020 and administered by the \nBank of the Cook Islands (BCI). The government provided the funding to BCI to prevent damage to BCI\u2019s balance \nsheet or risk profile. Loans are offered on a 4-year term and 2-year grace period at an interest rate of 3%, which is \nreduced to 1% if repaid in the first 12 months. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ncriteria,  with  loans  starting  at  NZ$12,500  plus  NZ$2,000  per  full-time  employee  (capped  at \nNZ$312,500). As of the start of September, about NZ$2 million had been disbursed through this \nfacility to 23 applicants and 60 applications were under review. \n \n22. \nRecovery: preserving and improving human capital. Measures have been introduced \nwith the aim of supporting eventual recovery. Businesses may access the wage subsidy (para. \n16)  by  placing  75%  of  their  staff  in  approved  training  initiatives.  The  training  subsidy  allows \nbusinesses  to  continue  to  access  the  wage  subsidy  payments  for  their  staff,  but  it  waives  the \nmonthly eligibility review requirement for up to 3 months and provides a cash grant to the business \nupon  course  completion. 24  The  Cook  Islands  Tertiary  Training  Institute  (under  Ministry  of \nEducation) and the University of the South Pacific provide confirmation of student enrollments. In \nconjunction with the training subsidy, the government arranged for free tertiary courses through \nthese  institutions.  Accredited  courses  are  being  offered  in  43  areas  including  trades  (building, \nelectrical, and plumbing), hospitality, and business, as well as a range of short courses. Courses \nare open to all residents and must commence before December 2020 with some courses being \ndelivered online. As of September, 2,200 course registrations had been received. \n \n23. \nRecovery  and  transformation:  support  for  investment.  The  government  has \nintroduced  initiatives  to  assist  businesses  in  maintaining  and  expanding  their  capital  stock  to \nsupport an economic recovery. These measures include accelerated depreciation until December \n2021.25 The  investment  initiatives  are  also  supported  by  the  Business  Growth  Loan  Program, \nwhich  guarantees  80%  of  loans  issued  under  the  program,  up  to  NZ$1  million  per  loan.  The \ncommercial banks run the program and offer loans at interest rates between 5% and 6% and a \nterm of 8 years. Businesses must (i) demonstrate pre-crisis viability; (ii) be up-to-date on loan, tax, \nand registry obligations; and (iii) not use the funds for shareholder payments, residential property, \nor debt refinancing. The government has also encouraged investment in agri-business by offering \na grant of up to NZ$50,000 and in information and communication technology by offering a grant \nof up to NZ$100,000 to incentivize diversification and innovation. \n \n24. \nOther measures. In addition to the ERP, grants to community organizations have been \nincreased for FY2021 by 25% (NZ$200,000) across 28 organizations. 26 Two-thirds of this new \nfunding will support 17 existing community organizations that provide community services to the \nelderly, infirm, people with disabilities, and domestic violence and women\u2019s organizations. Funds \nare committed for 3 years to provide budget certainty.  \n \n25. \nThe Cook Islands is heavily reliant on imported food, mainly from New Zealand. COVID-\n19-induced supply chain disruptions to air freight and cargo vessel volumes pose a risk to food \nsecurity. 27  Recognizing  this,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  introduced  an  immediate  recovery \npackage  to  secure  food  security  and  improve  nutrition  by  supporting  local  agriculture  and \nhousehold  production.  As  of  September,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  provided  394  households \n\n \n\n24 About 730 employees and 52 businesses are using the training subsidy in this way. The training subsidy program \nended in September 2020. Cash grants are related to the businesses\u2019 pre-crises turnover: NZ$3,000 for businesses \nwith  turnover  below  NZ$300,000;  NZ$6,000  for  businesses with  turnover  up  to  NZ$5  million;  and  NZ$10,000  for \nbusinesses with turnover above NZ$5 million. \n\n25 Accelerated  depreciation  would  be  at  the  rate  of  100%  depreciation  in  the  first  year  for  all  investments  below \nNZ$50,000; 25% depreciation on capital works and buildings; and 50% depreciation on sustainable and green capital \nassets. Sustainable and green assets are assessed by the existing Mana Tiaki eco-certification for tourism operators \nand the Green Panel for non-tourism operators. The Green Panel will use the criteria that assets should (i) minimize \ndamage  to  the environment  or  improve  environmental outcomes;  (ii) benefit or  not harm  the  social structure  and \nculture of the community where it is located; and (iii) be financially viable for the business concerned. \n\n26 Community  organizations  refer  to  nongovernment  groups  formally  registered  with  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs \n\ndelivering not-for-profit services to the Cook Islands community on both a voluntary and paid basis. \n\n27 Logistics Cluster.

ADB\u2019s CARES \nProgram  will  support  the  ERP  by  delivering  the  following  outputs:  (i)  the  health  care  system\u2019s \nCOVID-19  response  measures  strengthened,  (ii)  livelihoods  protected  by  compensating  for \neconomic  losses,  and  (iii)  economic  relief  for  affected  businesses  delivered.  The  program  will \ncontribute toward achieving an outcome where the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the Cook \nIslands\u2019 population  and businesses  are reduced to  alleviate the pressure  on the  government\u2019s \nfiscal position. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nADB\u2019s value addition. The program is part of wider ADB support covering the immediate \n27.\nresponse  to  COVID-19,  short-term  financing  needs,  and  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nsupport the government response. ADB provided support for the initial fiscal impacts of the crisis \nby  disbursing  $10.06  million  under  the  Cook  Islands  Disaster  Resilience  Program.28 The  Asia \nPacific Disaster Response Fund provided $1 million, and ADB TA provided a further $270,000 for \nPPE  and  essential  medical  equipment  to  respond  to  immediate  health  needs.29 The  CARES \nProgram contributes to the short-term financing need created by the ERP, particularly in FY2021. \nTo enable the lending and credit measures of the ERP to proceed, ADB TA supported the drafting \nof  the  COVID-19  (Economic  Response)  Act  2020.30 The  ADB  has  undertaken  a  rapid  social \nassessment to evaluate the potential impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups and the impacts \nof government income support.31 This supported the program by facilitating improved access to \ngender-disaggregated  data  and  guided  the  targeting  of  future  ADB  TA,  including  providing \ncapacity in gender and social assistance, budget planning, policy capacity, and data collection.32\n\nRegional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  CARES  Program  supports  Cook  Islands\u2019 \n28.\nregional cooperation and integration by providing support to tourism businesses (paras. 20\u201323) \nthat should  enable regional tourism to recover more  quickly, and support for the livelihoods  of \nmigrant workers (paras. 16\u201319). The ADB support should also be seen in the broader context of \nongoing and planned ADB operations that include the completion of the Manatua submarine cable, \nconnecting  the  Cook  Islands  to  global  telecommunications  infrastructure,  investments  in \nsanitation and renewable energy to safeguard the pristine environment, and planned upgrades to \nRarotonga airport.

It also highlights the \ncrucial role of development partner coordination for a comprehensive crisis response.  \n \nC. \n \nGovernment-led  coordination.  The  government,  through  its  oversight  committees, \n30. \nprovides  strategic  direction  and  coordination.  The  Government  of  New  Zealand  provided  an \nadditional  NZ$22 million  to  Cook  Islands to  support  ERP  phases I  and  II,  as  well  as  providing \nhygiene  packs  to  vulnerable  people  and  schools,  food  packs  to  the  elderly,  PPE  and  medical \nequipment  to  MOH.  The  New  Zealand  Ministry  of  Health  directly  supports  its  Cook  Islands \ncounterpart, including providing assistance to meet international standards on COVID-19 testing. \nThe  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  has  received  funds  and  donated  medical  supplies  and \nequipment from Australia, New Zealand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and ADB. The World \nHealth  Organization  has  provided  training  and  technical  guidance  on  critical  preparedness, \nreadiness, and response actions for COVID-19. The government is actively engaged in the Pacific \nHumanitarian Pathway to support a regional response to the crisis.34 \n \n31. \nADB has been closely coordinating with development partners, such as the Government \nof New Zealand, on economic assessments and supporting the government during the crisis. ADB \nhas  also  held  bilateral  meetings  with  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  (AIIB)  officials  on \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  issues  to  facilitate  parallel  AIIB  cofinancing  of  $20  million.  AIIB  will \nutilize some of the due diligence and documentation provided by ADB to progress their operation.  \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe  adverse  economic  and  fiscal  impacts  of  COVID-19  will  significantly  raise \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs. The financing needs of $16.0 million (equivalent to 5.1% of GDP) \nin FY2020 were met from cash reserves. An estimated $93.4 million (33.1%) is required in FY2021 \n(Table 5). This financing gap will be partially met with grants from New Zealand, ADB (from the \nDisaster  Response  Program  and  this  CPRO)  lending,  and  AIIB  lending,  with  the  government \nsupplementing these sources through use of cash reserves, which will come under pressure by \nthe end of FY2021.35 \n \n33. \nThe government has requested a loan of NZ$30,409,000 (equivalent to $20.0 million, as \nof 12 October 2020) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan \nwill have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. The average loan maturity, using annuity method based on 30% discount \nfactor,  is  7.82  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.

Manila. \n\nc  New Zealand grant funding of NZ$15 million ($9.9 million) in FY2021 relates to general budget support to assist the \n\nCook Islands Government\u2019s COVID-19 response. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and staff estimates. \n \n34. \nDebt  sustainability.  The  Cook  Islands\u2019  public  debt  is  almost  wholly  external,  with \ndomestic debt at only 1% of total public debt. External public debt net of the Loan Reserve Fund \nfell from 26.4% of GDP in FY2016 to 16.7% by FY2019. Accumulated fiscal surpluses resulted in \nan increase in the general reserve to the equivalent of 19.8% of GDP at the end of FY2019. This \nreduced  the  need  for  external  financing  in  the  immediate  response  to  the  COVID-19  crisis, \nalthough  the  heavy  economic  and  fiscal  impacts  of  COVID-19  will  require  debt  financing  from \nFY2021 onwards (with the general reserve exhausted), bringing net debt to an estimated 43.8% \nin FY2021. ADB\u2019s DSA shows that debt will maintain on a steady downward trend as the economy \nrecovers from the third quarter of 2021, even under conservative economic growth assumptions \nin  the  medium  term.  The  loan  is  also  not  seen  to  add  significantly  to  annual  debt  service \nobligations facing the government. Therefore, ADB\u2019s DSA concludes that the Cook Islands\u2019 public \ndebt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities will likely be contained over the medium term.36  \n \nE. \n \n35.  MFEM will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will oversee the implementation of ERP \nmeasures. MFEM will provide semiannual reporting to ADB to monitor the program outcomes and \nindicators, as specified in the design and monitoring framework, and social and gender monitoring \nmatrix.  The  implementing  agencies  include  MOH, the Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  and  the  local \nbanking institutions. MFEM has agreements with implementing agencies outlining relevant criteria \nfor  each  initiative,  funding  mechanism,  and  financial  reporting  requirement.  Although  the \ngovernment  faces  general  capacity  constraints,  the  program  risks  are  mitigated  because  the \ngovernment has successfully implemented ERP measures through existing systems.37 ADB will \nprovide  TA  resources  to  supplement  the  government\u2019s  capacity  in  monitoring  and  evaluating \nsocial  assistance  programs,  public  financial  management,  and  data  collection  (para.  27).  The \nprogram implementation period is from April 2020 to January 2021. The loan will be withdrawn to \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n36 Cook Islands: Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\na government account in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the loan and \ngrant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as \namended from time to time).38 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n36. \nGovernance. The Cook Islands has a strong history of sound fiscal management, with \nstrong fiscal  anchors  supporting  the  limited  use of  debt  and the  accumulation  of  fiscal  buffers. \nThe 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment noted the strength of the \nCook  Islands\u2019  budget  process  and  documentation,  financial  monitoring  and  reporting,  financial \nreconciliation,  transparency  in  the  tax  system,  and  public  access  to  information. 39  The \nassessment  also  noted  weaknesses  in  multiyear  budget  planning,  commitment  controls, \nmonitoring  fiscal  risks,  timely  audit  reports  and  procurement.  The  government  has  pursued \nreforms through its Public Financial Management road map for 2016\u20132020 supported by the IMF \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre.40 The following proven government systems are \nbeing  used  to  implement  the  ERP:  the  tax  system  for  income  assessments,  the  electronic \nsettlements between the Treasury and the Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund, existing \nonline platforms for business applications and payments, and the existing fortnightly social welfare \nsystem for additional cash payments. The areas of implementation outside existing government \nsystems,  such  as  concessional  lending  initiatives,  are  being  managed  on  a  commercial  basis \nthrough  domestic  banks  that  are  overseen  by  the  Financial  Services  Commission.  ADB  will \nprovide  further  implementation  support  (para.  27).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to the government and MFEM. \n \nPoverty. The rapid social assessment commissioned by ADB showed that COVID-19 has \n37. \nheightened  existing  social  inequities  in  the  Cook  Islands.  The  potential  disruption  of  social \nservices  and  increased  social  isolation  heightened  the  vulnerability  of  the  elderly  (15%  of  the \npopulation), people with disabilities (28% have at least one form of disability), and people with \npre-existing conditions (24% of the population). The assessment stated that the government has \neffectively  targeted  its  income  support  to  the  working  population  most  likely  to  become \nunemployed  and  to  those  receiving  social  welfare  payments  who  were  already  vulnerable. \nEmployment  measures  and  grant  support  for  sole  traders  are  open  to  informal  and  migrant \nworkers  (predominantly  women)  who  are  particularly  vulnerable  and  may  not  have  means  of \nsupport  during  the  business  downturn.  The  free  education  initiatives  will  support  the  ability  of \nformal and informal workers to improve lifetime incomes. Challenges remain for providing services \nto people with disabilities and those in the outer islands, which have much more limited access to \nhealth services and telecommunications, increasing their vulnerability to COVID-19 disruptions.  \n \n38. \nGender. The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The program ensures \nthat all women employers and employees have access to support, including (i) a wage subsidy \nfor all women in affected businesses, (ii) an unemployment benefit for all women at risk of losing \ntheir jobs, (iii) the assurance that all public servants (of which 55.8% are women) will continue to \nbe employed, (iv) the continuation of training opportunities being offered to women at similar rates \nto males, and (v) grant and credit assistance for women-owned businesses. Existing formal social \nprotection  measures  are  continuing,  including the  pension  scheme (51.8%  to  women)  and  the \ncaregivers\u2019, infirm, and destitute allowance (60.2% to women). The program has provided school \nclosure support payments, an electricity subsidy scheme that includes all households headed by \n\n \n\n38 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 IMF  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Center. 2015.

The  ADB  has  prepared  a \ngender monitoring matrix to support the implementation and monitoring of gender actions.41 \n\n39.\nSafeguards. No adverse environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples\nimpacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. Thus, the program\nis classified category C for environment, involuntary settlement, and indigenous peoples.\n\n40.\nRisks and mitigating measures.

Adverse impact of\n\nexogenous\nshocks\n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\nThe  Cook  Islands  is  one  of  the  most  tourism-dependent  countries  in  the  region,  with \ntourism receipts equivalent to 61.4% of GDP in 2019. With the shutdown of international \ntravel,  GDP  is  estimated  to  have  fallen  7.0%  in  FY2020,  down  from  5.3%  growth  in \nFY2019. If borders open to tourism in January 2021, then it is anticipated that GDP will fall \na further 15.4% in FY2021, with persistent and extreme risks to this outlook. These are \nthe  largest  economic  contractions  in  Cook  Islands  history  and  will  continue  to  have  a \nprofound  impact  on  unemployment,  business  viability,  government  finances,  and  Cook \nIslands society. The tourism-related sectors account for around 2,730 jobs (or 36.7% of \nthe total workforce) representing around half or all non-public sector employment\u2014these \njobs are at risk the longer the shutdown continues. The public sector is the other major \ncontributor  to  the  economy,  but  government  revenue  will  also  face  significant  declines, \nfalling  an  estimated  41%  in  FY2021  as  compared  to  FY2019  levels.  Combined  with \nstimulus measures, ADB estimates a fiscal deficit of 33.1% of GDP in FY2021 which will \nplace government cash reserves under increasing pressure, even with ADB support. The \nslow  anticipated  recovery  in  international  tourism  will  continue  to  weigh  on  revenue  in \nFY2022  and  beyond,  potentially  forcing  the  Government  to  undertake  significant \nexpenditure cuts. \n\n2. Countercyclical\ndevelopment\nexpenditures\n\nThe Economic Response Plan (ERP) is divided into two phases: (i) NZ$42.6 million ($28.0 \nmillion / 8.6% of GDP) for FY2020; and (ii) NZ$89.7 million ($59.0 million / 20.9% of GDP) \nfor FY2021. The ERP centers around four themes (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Cook Islands Government: COVID-19 Economic Response Plan \n\nCOVID-19 Medical Response and preparation \nLifeline \u2013 Supporting livelihoods \nRecovery \u2013 Kickstarting Growth \nTransformation \u2013 Moving to smarter greener economy \nTotal in NZD \n(Total in USD) \n\nFY2020\n(NZ$ m) \n7.3 \n35.3 \nN/A \nN/A \n42.6 \n(USD28m) \n\nFY2021\n(NZ$ m) \n3.9 \n63.4 \n19.0 \n3.0 \n89.7 \n(USD59m) \n\nThe ERP provides support the health system, payments for employment support, tax and \ncredit relief for businesses, free or subsidized re-training, personal income tax reductions, \ncash  support  to  vulnerable  households  and  those  required  to  self-isolate,  grants  to \nbusinesses and sole traders (including in the informal sector), and capital for private sector \nlending.  \n\nGovernment  support  measures  currently  benefit  82%  of  private  sector  employment. \nSupport for those outside the formal sector including the estimated 4.3% to 12.4% of the \ntotal workforce in the informal sector, is provided through additional cash transfers to all \nstate  pensions  (universal  coverage  above  age  60)  and  the  child  support  payments \n(universal on a per-child basis), cash grants for sole traders and a dedicated Emergency \nHardship Fund for those not covered through these payments or via formal employment \nsupport  mechanisms.  The  maintenance  of  government  employment  in  remote  islands \nsupports public sector workers. \n \n\nPrior  to the  COVID-19 pandemic,  the  Cook  Islands  was implementing  sound  economic \npolicies. The fiscal balance has averaged 5.7% of GDP and GDP growth has averaged \n6.7% between FY2016\u2013FY2019. Successive fiscal surpluses have enabled the creation \nof fiscal buffers (the Stabilisation Account: NZ$56.7 million, 11.4% of GDP prior to COVID-\n19 in FY2020) and a sinking fund to smooth debt servicing requirements and aid in better \ncash  management  (the  Loan  Reserve  Fund:  NZ$21.4  million,  4.3%  of  GDP;  around  2 \nyears-worth of debt servicing requirements in FY2020).  Revenue has performed strongly, \nespecially following tax reforms in 2014, with domestic revenue increasing from 39.1% of \nGDP  in  FY2016  to  41.0%  of GDP  in  FY2019.  Expenditure has  been largely  contained, \naveraging 37.5% of GDP in the FY2016\u201319 period. Public debt net of the Loan Reserve \n\n3.

Structural reforms \n(including health \nresponse) \n\nFund had fallen from 26.4% in FY2016 to 16.9% of GDP in FY2020.a Price growth has \nbeen contained, with inflation averaging 0.2% between FY2016\u2013FY2019. \n\nStrong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented \na  COVID-19  outbreak.  The  Cook  Islands  Emergency  Response  Plan  to  COVID-19 has \nlaid  out  a  pandemic  preparedness  and  management  plan,  including  tiered  systems  for \npandemic  response  and  management  and  widespread  testing.  The  Ministry  of  Health \n(MOH) activated its Health Emergency Response system on 22 January 2020, denying \nentry to travelers from affected countries later that month with the border closed on 24 \nMarch. Mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions and \nsocial distancing were enforced during the lockdown period.  Widespread testing began in \nmid-March,  with  the  Cook  Islands  declaring  itself  COVID-19  free  on  16  April  2020. \nLockdown restrictions were relaxed on 20 April. Community transmission of COVID-19 in \nNew  Zealand  on  11  August  2020  reinitiated  border  control  measures,  although  social \ndistancing measures were not reimposed. Domestic travel remains open. \n \nThe fiscal response and economic support measures have been integrated into, and have \naimed  to  strengthen,  existing  systems,  including  social  protections  and  public  health \nservices. The Economic Response Plan (ERP) represents approximately 29.5% of GDP \nacross FY2020 and FY2021 and aims to preserve the capacity of the economic sector in \norder to accelerate an eventual economic recovery. It does this by allowing businesses to \nremain operational  and preserve their  payroll  whilst  meeting  their debt  obligations.  The \nCOVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020 was passed to authorize and legislate policy \nresponses  where  needed,  particularly  those  measures  relating  to  credit  and  lending \ninitiatives. The Ministry of Health has indicated that it will likely continue and expand the \ncommunity-based health services commenced during the COVID-19 response, as well as \nimprovements  to  mental  health  services,  and  possible  long-term  reforms  to  elder  and \ndisability care. \n \nThe  Cook  Islands  has  been  a  vocal  and  proactive  partner  in  trying  to  establish  an \ninternational \u2018travel bubble\u2019 with its major tourist source market of New Zealand, but no \ntimeline has been set. \n\nThe Cook Islands is a group C country and not rated as a high risk of debt distress prior \nto the pandemic, but suffers similar issues to other Pacific small island states on account \nof  its  vulnerability  and  narrow  economic  base.  Following  the  pandemic,  drawdowns  of \nfiscal buffers will be complemented by an increase in debt financing from the ADB and \nparallel Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) operations (combined 14.2% of GDP) \nand will increase the debt-to-GDP ratio from 16.9% in FY2020 to 43.8% in FY2021, above \nthe government debt ceiling of 35%, although debt net of the Loan Reserve Fund will reach \nthis level by FY2024.b The Cook Islands does not have a central bank or direct access to \ndebt or bond markets. \n\n5.  Debt sustainability \n\n6.  Coordination with \n\nthe IMF \n\nThe ADB has undertaken a macroeconomic assessment and DSA as the Cook Islands is \nnot a member of the IMF. The AIIB has requested that the ADB assessment also be used \nto facilitate its operation. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund. \na  For the purposes of calculation, net debt is calculated as total outstanding public debt minus the funds already paid \n\ninto the Loan Reserve Fund. \n\nb  The  government  set  a  ceiling  at  35%  of  GDP  following  the  Manila  agreement  (1998) between  the  Cook  Islands, \nNauru,  New  Zealand  and  the  ADB  (the  major  creditors).
