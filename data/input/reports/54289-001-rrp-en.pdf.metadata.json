THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Cook Islands for the COVID-19 Active Response and Economic Support (CARES) Program \nunder the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The program is part of a coordinated package of Asian Development Bank (ADB) support \nto mitigate the severe socioeconomic and potential health impacts caused by the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic by supporting the government\u2019s Economic Response Plan (ERP).2 \nThe program will help the government combat the entry and spread of COVID-19 and provide \nassistance to vulnerable groups, households, and businesses. This program is critical because \nthe Cook Islands faces significant declines in international tourism and government revenue \nbecause of COVID-19.  \n \n3.   The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration.3 It is also aligned with the Pacific Approach priorities of managing risks and building \n \nresilience by strengthening the health sector and social protection.4 The Cook Islands meets all \nthe access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \n1.  Adverse  The Cook Islands is one of the Pacific region\u2019s most tourism-dependent countries, with \nimpact of  receipts equivalent to 61.4% of GDP in FY2019. With the shutdown of international travel, \nexogenous  GDP is estimated to have fallen 7.0% in FY2020, after 5.3% growth in FY2019. If borders \nshocks  were to open to tourism in January 2021, the ADB anticipates that GDP will fall a further 15.4% \nin FY2021, with persistent and extreme risks. Tourism-related sectors account for about 2,730 \njobs (or 36.7% of the total workforce). Government revenue is estimated to fall 41% in FY2021 \ncompared to FY2019 levels. Combined with stimulus measures, ADB estimates a fiscal deficit \nof 33.1% of GDP in FY2021, which will exhaust accumulated fiscal reserves by the end of \n2021, with the government possibly needing to undertake fiscal consolidation. Of the \npopulation, 8.4% falls below the basic needs poverty line, with 13.6% categorized as \nvulnerable. The crisis is expected to reverse poverty gains, especially if job losses are \nrealized. \n2.  Countercyclical  The ERP is a comprehensive government stimulus program, financed in two phases: (i) $28.0 \ndevelopment  million (8.6% of GDP) for FY2020, and (ii) $59.0 million (20.9% of GDP) for FY2021. It \nexpenditures  provides support for the health system, payments for employment support, tax and credit relief \nfor businesses, free or subsidized re-training, cash support to poor and vulnerable households \nand those required to self-isolate, countercyclical private sector lending, and electricity tariff \ndiscounting. The COVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020, a time-bound (5 years) piece of \nlegislation, was passed to allow the government\u2019s credit initiatives within the ERP to proceed. \n3.  Pre-shock  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cook Islands was implementing sound economic \nrecord of  policies. Between FY2016 and FY2019, the fiscal surplus averaged 5.7% of GDP, and GDP \ngenerally sound  growth averaged 6.7%. Fiscal surpluses enabled fiscal buffers: the Stabilisation Account of \nmacroeconomic  NZ$56.7 million (11.4% of FY2020 GDP prior to COVID-19) and the Loan Reserve Fund to \nmanagement  smooth debt servicing (NZ$21.4 million, about 2 years\u2019 worth of debt servicing). Government \nrevenue performed strongly following tax reforms in 2014, increasing from 39.1% of GDP in \nFY2016 to 41.0% in FY2019. Expenditure has been largely contained, averaging 37.5% of \nGDP over FY2016\u2013FY2019. Net debt fell from 26.4% of GDP in FY2016 to 16.9% in FY2020.a \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Structural  Early travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented a COVID-19 outbreak. The Cook \nreforms  Islands Emergency Response Plan to COVID-19 laid out a pandemic preparedness and \n(including  management plan. MOH activated its Health Emergency Response system on 22 January \nhealth  2020, denying entry to travelers from affected countries, and the border was closed on 24 \nresponse)  March. A mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions, and \nsocial distancing were enforced during a lockdown period. Widespread testing began in mid-\nMarch, with the Cook Islands declaring itself COVID-19 free on 16 April 2020. Lockdown \nrestrictions were relaxed on 20 April, but border control measures were maintained because \nof the risk of COVID-19 community transmission in major tourist markets. MOH has indicated \nthat it will likely continue and expand the community-based health services that began during \nthe COVID-19 response, as well as improvements to mental health services and possible \nlong-term reforms to eldercare and disability care. \n5.  Debt  The Cook Islands is a group C country and was not rated high risk of debt distress prior to the \nsustainability  pandemic, but it suffers similar issues to other Pacific small island states because of its \nvulnerability and narrow economic base. Following COVID-19, drawdowns of fiscal buffers \nwill be complemented by debt financing from ADB and AIIB (combined 14.2% of GDP) and \nwill increase the debt-to-GDP ratio from 16.9% in FY2020 to a peak of 43.8% in FY2021, \nabove the government debt ceiling of 35.0%. An ADB DSA assesses that under this program \nthe Cook Islands is in a sustainable debt position over the medium term, with net debt \nreaching 35% in FY2024. \n6.  Coordination  ADB undertook a macroeconomic assessment and DSA since the Cook Islands is not a \nwith the IMF  member of the IMF.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n4.  Development context. The Cook Islands consists of 15 islands with a land area of 67 \nsquare kilometers, spread across 2 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean. Almost \n80% of the population of 17,434 in 2020 resides in Rarotonga. The shift in economic structure \ntoward tourism since the late 1990s has led to rapid development, with basic needs poverty falling \nfrom 28.4% in 2006 to 8.4% by 2016. The Cook Islands is one of the smallest and most remote \nnations in the Pacific Ocean, with high cost structures and limited natural resources. The economy \nremains  heavily  dependent  on  international  trade  (including  tourism);  and  future  growth  is \nhampered by disproportionately expensive public administration and infrastructure costs, a small \npopulation, and high exposure to disaster and climate risks. The Cook Islands is not a member of \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank, so it has limited access to external \nsupport.  \n \n5.  Preemptive health response. The Cook Islands has avoided a COVID-19 outbreak \nwithin its borders. With the global outbreak of the pandemic, the Ministry of Health (MOH) \nactivated the Health Emergency Response System in January 2020.5 Following the progressive \ntightening of controls, including ceasing domestic travel, the border was completely closed to non-\nresidents on 24 March (Table 1). On the same day, a mandatory 14-day quarantine was \n \n5 MOH is also referred to as Te Marae Ora. ", "    3 \nimplemented for incoming residents, schools were closed, and social distancing was enforced.6 \nWidespread testing began in mid-March, and the Cook Islands declared itself free of COVID-19 \non 16 April. Domestic controls have been relaxed, but the border remains closed.  \n \n6.  Vulnerable  health  system.  The  high  prevalence  of  hypertension,  diabetes,  and \ncardiovascular  diseases  in  the  Cook  Islands  makes  it  more  vulnerable  to  COVID-19.  The \nRarotonga Hospital, the nation\u2019s main health facility, has a capacity of about 170 beds, with 32 \nrepurposed  into  an  isolation  ward  for  potential  COVID-19  cases.  The  estimated  potential \nrequirement for hospital beds is about double the current capacity, and there are only three \nventilators.7 Hotels have been identified to provide screening and quarantine, and there is one \nGeneXpert machine  for  processing  COVID-19 tests (although  most  tests  are  sent to  New \nZealand). Health care is publicly funded, with services provided for free or for nominal fees. The \nskilled  health  professionals  density  of  7.0  per  1,000  population  is  above  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal minimum threshold of 4.45 per 1,000 population, but it relies on rotational staff \nfrom New Zealand for acute care and surgical services. These services are presently on hold, \nadding to the pressure on health workers. The majority of the health care workforce has had \nadditional training in pandemic response, but the high infection rate of COVID-19 could rapidly \ndeplete the workforce.  \n \n7.  Tourism significantly affected. The Cook Islands is among the most tourism-driven \neconomies in the Pacific region, with tourism receipts equivalent to 61.4% of annual gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in FY2019. New Zealand is the primary tourism market, accounting for \n67% of FY2019 arrivals. The economy enjoyed sustained growth averaging 4.9% of GDP \nbetween FY2012 and FY2019 as visitor arrivals rose from 113,129 in 2011 to a peak of 171,550 \nin 2019. From July 2019 to February 2020, visitor arrivals were 5.3% higher than the same period \nin the previous year. However, with borders closed to non-residents since March 2020, visitor \narrivals have fallen to almost zero. The Cook Islands\u2019 economic trajectory is tied to efforts to \nreopen its border with New Zealand. With closed borders, the potential impacts on livelihoods and \nbusinesses are severe even with government stimulus; each month that the border is closed, the \neconomy is estimated to lose an additional 3% of its annual GDP.8 Since there is no central bank, \nthe banking sector relies on public sector liquidity, with a fiscal crisis likely to be exacerbated by \na financial crisis if public reserves are depleted before economic recovery takes hold. Supply \ndisruptions have impacted imports, but local value chains are largely tied to tourism activity. \n \n8.  Unprecedented  economic  losses.  ADB  estimates  that  GDP  fell  7.0%  in  FY2020 \nbecause of the impact of COVID-19 on visitor arrivals in the fourth quarter, a dramatic turnaround \nfrom the 4.5% growth projected in December 2019.9 Even if the border were to open to tourism \nin January 2021, ADB estimates that GDP would fall a further 15.4% in FY2021, despite extensive \ngovernment stimulus efforts. The decline would be the largest in Cook Islands\u2019 history, negatively \nimpacting employment, business viability, government finances, and social wellbeing.  \n \n9.  Pre-shock record of sound economic management. Over FY2016\u2013FY2019, the fiscal \nsurplus averaged 5.7% (Table 2). Revenue performed strongly, especially following tax reforms \nin 2014, with domestic revenue increasing from 39.1% of GDP in FY2016 to 41.0% of GDP in \n \n6  All mass gathering events were cancelled, including church, sports, and social gatherings outside of immediate \nhouseholds. To safely socially distance at shops, customer limits were recommended, and restrictions were placed \non children being in stores. \n7  Projections based on the Cook Islands\u2019 population of 17,434 with a 10% infection rate given current preparedness \nmeasures; 20% of those infected will require hospitalization, and 5% will be severe and require ventilators. \n8  ADB. 2020.

Expenditure has been largely contained, averaging 37.5% of GDP over FY2016\u2013FY2019. \nThe successive fiscal surpluses since FY2016 have enabled the creation of fiscal buffers in the \nStabilisation Account, which reached 11.4% of GDP in FY2020 prior to COVID-19, and the Loan \nReserve Fund (a sinking fund) of 4.3% of GDP to smooth debt servicing requirements and aid in \nbetter cash management. Debt financing is used predominantly for infrastructure investment, has \nbeen low and stable, and was 16.7% of GDP in FY2019 after accounting for prepayments.  \n \nTable 2: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019  FY2020e  FY2021p \nReal GDP growth (% change)  6.0  6.8  8.9  5.3  (7.0)  (15.4) \nInflation (% annual change)  (0.1)  (0.1)  0.1  0.8  1.5  1.7 \nCentral government budget             \nTotal revenue and grants   39.1  47.9  44.8  41.0  44.4  39.7 \n  Total revenue   35.6  44.9  43.0  39.6  40.1  30.9 \n    of which: tax revenue   29.4  31.5  27.2  29.5  28.2  21.2 \n  Nontax revenue  6.2  13.4  15.8  10.1  11.9  9.7 \n  Grants   3.5  3.0  1.8  1.4  4.3  8.8 \nTotal expenditure  35.4  35.4  43.4  35.9  49.5  72.7 \n  Current expenditure   29.5  28.1  31.3  29.2  41.8  63.0 \n    of which: wages and salaries  13.8  13.8  13.8  11.0  13.7  16.6 \n  Capital expenditure  5.9  7.4  12.2  6.7  7.8  9.9 \nFiscal balance  3.7  12.5  1.4  5.1  (5.1)  (33.1) \n  Excluding grants  0.1  9.5  (0.4)  3.7  (9.4)  (41.8) \nPublic net debt   26.4  17.3  18.5  16.7  16.9  43.8 \nNominal GDP ($ million, current prices)  291.1  325.7  369.1  359.2  313.6  282.5 \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management FY2020/2021 Budget, Asian Development \nOutlook database, and Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n10.  Sharp reversal of fiscal performance. The collapse of the tourism industry will have a \ndramatic impact on government tax collection (71.9% of total government revenue in FY2019). \nAfter falling to 28.2% of GDP in FY2020, tax receipts are estimated to decline to 21.2% of GDP \nin FY2021. Expenditure is expected to grow from 49.5% of GDP in FY2020 to 72.7% of GDP in \nFY2021 because of the countercyclical expenditure program. The fiscal deficit of $16.0 million \n(5.1% of GDP) in FY2020 was largely funded by government cash reserves, but the $93.4 million \ndeficit (33.1% of GDP) in FY2021 will require debt financing to avoid placing extreme pressure on \ngovernment cash reserves. The ADB anticipates the borrowing required to sharply increase public \nnet debt from the equivalent of 16.7% of GDP in FY2019 to 43.8% by the end of FY2021. \n \n11.  Pressure on jobs and household incomes. The latest available data shows tourism-\nrelated sectors accounted for 2,729 jobs in 2016 (36.7% of the total workforce), representing \nabout half of all non-public sector employment, including informal labor.10 The public sector \naccounted for a further 26.5% of the workforce, with other retail services (17.0%) and construction, \nmanufacturing, and utilities (10.1%) making up most of the remainder. The Cook Islands has high \nformal employment, with only between 4.3% and 12.4% of the total workforce engaged in informal \nwork. Women comprise 60.5% of tourism-related jobs, and the sector accounts for 63.3% of all \njobs held by women. With tourism-related jobs at risk, there is a risk of substantial development \nprogress unwinding. The 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey estimates that 8.4% \nof the population falls below the basic needs poverty line, down from 28.4% in 2006. A further \n13.6% of the population was defined as vulnerable in 2016, falling from 40.0% in 2006.11 With \n \n10  Cook Islands Government. 2016. Cook Islands 2016 Census of Population and Housing. Rarotonga.  \n11  Food poverty is defined as not being able to reach 2,100 calories a day; basic needs poverty is defined as less than \n$1.90 per day; and vulnerable is defined as income within 20% of basic needs poverty. Baseline estimates and \n ", "    5 \nCOVID-19 likely to reduce incomes below the 2016 level, it is estimated that vulnerable persons \nwill increase to above 15% of the population and basic needs poverty will increase to 9% in \n2021.12 Job losses will exacerbate these effects, with those out of work unlikely to meet basic \nneeds, especially in Rarotonga where subsistence alternatives are not universally available. \n \n12.  Gender equality gains at risk. In the event of COVID-19 infections, women are at an \nincreased risk of infection because of their role as frontline health workers and care givers. Indirect \nrisks include worsening health outcomes if essential services, such as maternal and reproductive \nhealth and noncommunicable diseases, are de-prioritized. Socioeconomic impacts for women \ninclude increased poverty from loss of income. Women in the Cook Islands earn 8.0% less than \nmen, work more part-time, and carry more of the burden of unpaid care and household tasks. \nWomen represent 60.5% of the workers in tourism-related businesses. Data pre-pandemic shows \nthat around one-third of all households are headed by women; and that these households, have \nincomes around 18% lower on average than households headed by men. Households headed by \nelderly women are particularly vulnerable to low income and social isolation, and households \nheaded by women face increased risk of poverty. The economic pressures of COVID-19 will \nworsen this. Gender-based violence (GBV) service providers have experienced an increase in \nthe number of domestic violence cases being reported since the onset of COVID-19.13 The \ncollection and use of sex-disaggregated data are limited.  \n \n13.  Comprehensive countercyclical expenditure program. The ERP aims to mitigate the \nimpacts of COVID-19 on livelihoods and local businesses, including vulnerable households, in a \nway that does not undermine the government\u2019s ability to carry out further fiscal intervention.14 The \nERP is financed in two phases: (i) NZ$42.6 million ($28.0 million, 8.6% of GDP) for FY2020, and \n(ii) NZ$89.7 million ($59.0 million, 20.9% of GDP) for FY2021. The four themes of the ERP are (i) \nCOVID-19 medical response and preparation (paras. 14\u201315), (ii) lifeline measures to support \nlivelihoods through support to households and businesses (paras. 16\u201321), (iii) recovery measures \nthat  can  help  kickstart  growth  (paras.  22\u201323),  and  (iv)  transformation  measures  to  help \nbusinesses (para. 23) (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Cook Islands Government: COVID-19 Economic Response Plan \n \nFY2020  FY2021 \n(NZ$ million)  (NZ$ million) \nCOVID-19 medical response and preparation  7.3  3.9 \nLifeline: supporting livelihoods  35 .3  63.4 \nRecovery: kickstarting growth    19.0 \nTransformation: moving to a smarter, greener economy  3.0 \nTotal  42.6  89.7 \n(Total in USD)  ($28.0 million)  ($59.0 million) \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, NZ = New Zealand, USD = United States dollar. \nSource: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \n14.  COVID-19 response and preparation. The government has taken steps to prepare for \nan outbreak. Frontline health workers, including 120 nurses (110 of whom are women), received \ntraining on personal and protective equipment (PPE), and additional PPE was procured with \ndevelopment partners, including ADB. Funding was allocated to converting excess hospital \ncapacity into a 32-bed isolation ward with a negative pressure room to cater for potential cases. \nThe government also recognizes the indirect impacts of COVID-19, with health workers and \n \ndefinitions from the Government of Cook Islands.

Rarotonga. \n12  ADB estimates based on the elasticity of poverty and hardship to changes in income over 2006\u20132016. \n13 Pre-COVID-19 data indicates that one in three women in the Cook Islands has experienced intimate partner violence \nin their lifetime.  \n14  Footnote 2. \n ", "6   \nvolunteers at the 10 Rarotonga punas15 being briefed on mental health and domestic violence. A \n24-hour mental health hotline was created alongside a similar service of the Ministry of Education \nfor students, teachers, and families. A network of people qualified to provide mental support also \nconducted workshops on stress and anxiety management, reaching up to 1,300 participants. \nHowever, the sole clinical psychologist at the hospital is overwhelmed with 136 active patients.  \n \n15.  Protecting non\u2013COVID-19 health care. Disability and eldercare and outpatient services \nhave been relocated from Rarotonga Hospital to the main health clinic to provide physical \nseparation  from  where  possible  COVID-19  cases  would  be  treated.  Phone-based  health \nconsultations and 24-hour COVID-19 hotline were established. The puna system was activated \nto provide localized access to public health officials, vaccinations, and free general practitioner \nconsultations.16 Pharmaceutical services were conducted remotely, with the punas acting as \ndistribution points to households at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., the elderly). \nMaternal health services have been maintained and made complimentary.17 \n \n16.  Supporting livelihoods. To protect workers from being laid off, about NZ$30 million is \ntargeted to wage subsidies that allow businesses (including informal businesses) to use staff to \nmaintain  physical  assets  and  improve  the  ability  of  businesses  to  recover  once  tourism \nrecommences. The subsidy is directed to companies that demonstrate a 30% reduction in income \nbetween March and June 2020 and a 50% reduction between July and December 2020. The \npayments are capped, based on the minimum hourly wage.18 Available data show that about 50% \nof the wage subsidy recipients have been women, who account for 47.6% of the labor force, and \nthat the subsidy supports about 66% of total private sector labor (Table 4).  \n \nTable 4: Wage Subsidy Implementation (April\u2013June 2020) \n        Subsidy paid \nMonth  Men  Women  Businesses  (NZ$ million) \nApril  1,826  1,788  407  3.7 \nMay  1,631  1,573  375  3.5 \nJune  1,649  1,604  291  3.0 \n  Source: The Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \n17.  To support those who lose jobs, unemployment benefits were temporarily enacted from \nApril to December 2020. The benefit is open to those above the age of 16 (excluding students \nand  self-employed)  who  have  lost  employment  since  March  2020,  are  actively  seeking \nemployment, are ready and able to work, and are not receiving the wage subsidy or business \ngrant. Eligible recipients are paid NZ$266 per week for 4 weeks, with a possible extension of up \nto an additional 2 months at a reduced rate of NZ$150 if recipients can demonstrate a genuine \nattempt to find work and provide written proof of community service, volunteer work, or training \nundertaken. As of August, 138 beneficiaries had received the unemployment benefit; of these, \n58.0%  (80)  are  women  and  16.7%  (23)  are migrant  workers.  Since  its  inception,  only  28 \n \n15 The term puna refers to the village system designed for mobilizing emergency response during and after cyclones. \n16  The puna system was developed in 2009 as part of the disaster management system. Rarotonga has 10 punas and \nthe outer islands have their own systems of community organization. The punas are community centers that have \nbeen set up and supported by volunteers from the area and include the secondment of public servants. General \npractitioner visits at the puna health centers are free during a daily 2-hour window or NZ$5 at the health clinic at \nTupapa. All general consultation services at the main hospital have ceased. \n17 Migrant workers used to be required to pay a fee.  \n18 Applications and payments are administered by the Cook Islands National Super Fund via an online portal adapted \nfor the purpose, and business eligibility is assessed by the Revenue Management Division of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Management (MFEM) each month. Payments are made electronically to the businesses, which are \nthen responsible for paying their staff as usual, with some additional requirements (e.g., businesses cannot reduce \nwork hours or force staff to utilize their leave entitlements). ", "    7 \nbeneficiaries have applied for and received the extension beyond the first month.19 The low \nuptake in the unemployment payment is attributed to the wage subsidy effectively holding workers \nin their current positions at higher levels of payments.20 \n \n18.  Social assistance. Existing social welfare schemes have been supplemented to support \nlivelihoods. A NZ$400 payment was made to those who access existing support, comprising \npensions for residents above the age of 60 (1,809 beneficiaries, 51.8% of whom are women), and \nto infirm and destitute people and caregivers (362 beneficiaries, 60.2% of whom are women). \nFamilies can also apply for the Emergency Hardship Fund as a backstop. Applicant families are \nmeans-tested, and payments can be taken in a lump-sum or spread across 2 months.21 The \nobligations are similar to the unemployment benefit (para. 17), but they allow the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs more discretion in allowing for special circumstances (e.g., when someone is \nphysically unable to work). The fund is available until December 2020.  \n \n19.  During the initial school closure period in April, an additional NZ$100 was given to the \nfamilies of every school-aged child, in addition to their regular NZ$50 fortnightly payment under \nthe child subsidy. Non-recipients of the existing child subsidy (mainly non-Cook Islanders and \nchildren of migrant workers) could apply for the NZ$100 payment through the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs. This benefit was intended to help families meet the educational requirements during the \nlockdown. A single round of payments targeted 4,742 children; of the payments, 4.4% (209) were \nmade to families of non-Cook Islanders and 47.8% (2,265) were made to the families of girls. \n \n20.  Interest  relief.  To  remove  a  major  source  of  financial  stress  for  businesses  and \nhouseholds, an interest relief program was introduced from July 2020 to June 2021 at an \nestimated cost of NZ$14.2 million. The government will provide 70% of the interest cost on all \nexisting debt held in domestic banks, up to NZ$175,000 per business or individual, in the form of \na grant payment to the banks on behalf of the borrower. The program works with the loan deferral \nperiod being offered by the commercial banks and limits the amount of accumulated interest once \nthe repayment deferral period is over. The payment will also help avoid the accumulation of \nnonperforming debt in the local financial market.  \n \n21.  Ensuring business continuity. Businesses and sole traders (including in the informal \nsector) that can show a 30% decline in revenue compared to pre-crisis levels were eligible for a \none-off payment in April depending on their level of turnover.22 The grants were delivered in April \nto 897 businesses, 314 of which were sole traders and 363 were small businesses in the lowest \nturnover category. A second round of grants for sole traders was issued in July. A collaborative \neffort from the Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement  (MFEM)  resulted  in  about  600  informal  businesses  and  sole  traders  being \nformalized since April to gain access to government support (including the wage subsidy). The \ngovernment  introduced  a  Business  Continuity  Credit  Facility  to  provide  businesses  with \nconcessional short-term liquidity during the downturn.23 Eligibility is based on the wage subsidy \n \n19 All recipients are required to sign up for the new online employment services portal provided by the government. \n20 Employment Services at the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that about 200 jobs have been listed on the \nhttps://www.employment.gov.ck/ website since its inception, with 40 vacancies posted as of 20 September 2020. \n21 Payments start at NZ$600 lump sum for an individual, with an extra NZ$100 per family member up to NZ$1,000. \n22 Sole traders were eligible for a grant of NZ$3,000, and businesses were eligible for grants of NZ$5,000, NZ$10,000 \nand NZ$15,000 where their respective turnover was under NZ$300,000, under NZ$5 million, or above. Applications \nwere made and assessed using the same process as the wage subsidy, and payments were made via the Cook \nIslands National Super Fund as soon as applications were approved. \n23 The facility is authorized under the emergency COVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020 and administered by the \nBank of the Cook Islands (BCI). The government provided the funding to BCI to prevent damage to BCI\u2019s balance \nsheet or risk profile. Loans are offered on a 4-year term and 2-year grace period at an interest rate of 3%, which is \nreduced to 1% if repaid in the first 12 months. \n ", "8   \ncriteria, with loans starting at NZ$12,500 plus NZ$2,000 per full-time employee (capped at \nNZ$312,500). As of the start of September, about NZ$2 million had been disbursed through this \nfacility to 23 applicants and 60 applications were under review. \n \n22.  Recovery: preserving and improving human capital. Measures have been introduced \nwith the aim of supporting eventual recovery. Businesses may access the wage subsidy (para. \n16) by placing 75% of their staff in approved training initiatives. The training subsidy allows \nbusinesses to continue to access the wage subsidy payments for their staff, but it waives the \nmonthly eligibility review requirement for up to 3 months and provides a cash grant to the business \nupon  course  completion.24 The  Cook  Islands  Tertiary  Training  Institute  (under  Ministry  of \nEducation) and the University of the South Pacific provide confirmation of student enrollments. In \nconjunction with the training subsidy, the government arranged for free tertiary courses through \nthese institutions. Accredited courses are being offered in 43 areas including trades (building, \nelectrical, and plumbing), hospitality, and business, as well as a range of short courses. Courses \nare open to all residents and must commence before December 2020 with some courses being \ndelivered online. As of September, 2,200 course registrations had been received. \n \n23.  Recovery  and  transformation:  support  for  investment.  The  government  has \nintroduced initiatives to assist businesses in maintaining and expanding their capital stock to \nsupport an economic recovery. These measures include accelerated depreciation until December \n2021.25 The investment initiatives are also supported by the Business Growth Loan Program, \nwhich guarantees 80% of loans issued under the program, up to NZ$1 million per loan. The \ncommercial banks run the program and offer loans at interest rates between 5% and 6% and a \nterm of 8 years. Businesses must (i) demonstrate pre-crisis viability; (ii) be up-to-date on loan, tax, \nand registry obligations; and (iii) not use the funds for shareholder payments, residential property, \nor debt refinancing. The government has also encouraged investment in agri-business by offering \na grant of up to NZ$50,000 and in information and communication technology by offering a grant \nof up to NZ$100,000 to incentivize diversification and innovation. \n \n24.  Other measures. In addition to the ERP, grants to community organizations have been \nincreased for FY2021 by 25% (NZ$200,000) across 28 organizations. 26 Two-thirds of this new \nfunding will support 17 existing community organizations that provide community services to the \nelderly, infirm, people with disabilities, and domestic violence and women\u2019s organizations. Funds \nare committed for 3 years to provide budget certainty.  \n \n25.  The Cook Islands is heavily reliant on imported food, mainly from New Zealand. COVID-\n19-induced supply chain disruptions to air freight and cargo vessel volumes pose a risk to food \nsecurity.27 Recognizing  this,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  introduced  an  immediate  recovery \npackage  to  secure  food  security  and  improve  nutrition  by  supporting  local  agriculture  and \nhousehold production. As of September, the Ministry of Agriculture provided 394 households \n \n24 About 730 employees and 52 businesses are using the training subsidy in this way. The training subsidy program \nended in September 2020. Cash grants are related to the businesses\u2019 pre-crises turnover: NZ$3,000 for businesses \nwith turnover below NZ$300,000; NZ$6,000 for businesses with turnover up to NZ$5 million; and NZ$10,000 for \nbusinesses with turnover above NZ$5 million. \n25 Accelerated depreciation would be at the rate of 100% depreciation in the first year for all investments below \nNZ$50,000; 25% depreciation on capital works and buildings; and 50% depreciation on sustainable and green capital \nassets. Sustainable and green assets are assessed by the existing Mana Tiaki eco-certification for tourism operators \nand the Green Panel for non-tourism operators. The Green Panel will use the criteria that assets should (i) minimize \ndamage to the environment or improve environmental outcomes; (ii) benefit or not harm the social structure and \nculture of the community where it is located; and (iii) be financially viable for the business concerned. \n26 Community organizations refer to nongovernment groups formally registered with the Ministry of Internal Affairs \ndelivering not-for-profit services to the Cook Islands community on both a voluntary and paid basis. \n27 Logistics Cluster.

Proposed Program, Impact, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition\n26. The aim of the Cook Islands ERP is to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on livelihoods \nand local businesses, including vulnerable households, in a way that does not undermine the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to undertake further fiscal intervention if needed (footnote 2). ADB\u2019s CARES \nProgram will support the ERP by delivering the following outputs: (i) the health care system\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response measures strengthened, (ii)  livelihoods  protected by compensating for \neconomic losses, and (iii) economic relief for affected businesses delivered. The program will \ncontribute toward achieving an outcome where the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the Cook \nIslands\u2019 population and businesses are reduced to alleviate the pressure on the government\u2019s \nfiscal position. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.\n27. ADB\u2019s value addition. The program is part of wider ADB support covering the immediate \nresponse to COVID-19, short-term financing needs, and ongoing technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport the government response. ADB provided support for the initial fiscal impacts of the crisis \nby disbursing $10.06 million under the Cook Islands Disaster Resilience Program.28 The Asia \nPacific Disaster Response Fund provided $1 million, and ADB TA provided a further $270,000 for \nPPE and essential medical equipment to respond to immediate health needs.29 The CARES \nProgram contributes to the short-term financing need created by the ERP, particularly in FY2021. \nTo enable the lending and credit measures of the ERP to proceed, ADB TA supported the drafting \nof the COVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020.30 The ADB has undertaken a rapid social \nassessment to evaluate the potential impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups and the impacts \nof government income support.31 This supported the program by facilitating improved access to \ngender-disaggregated data and guided the targeting of future ADB TA, including providing \ncapacity in gender and social assistance, budget planning, policy capacity, and data collection.32\n28. Regional cooperation and integration. The CARES Program supports Cook Islands\u2019 \nregional cooperation and integration by providing support to tourism businesses (paras. 20\u201323) \nthat should enable regional tourism to recover more quickly, and support for the livelihoods of \nmigrant workers (paras. 16\u201319). The ADB support should also be seen in the broader context of \nongoing and planned ADB operations that include the completion of the Manatua submarine cable, \nconnecting  the  Cook  Islands  to  global  telecommunications  infrastructure,  investments  in \nsanitation and renewable energy to safeguard the pristine environment, and planned upgrades to \nRarotonga airport. The Cook Islands is already engaged with New Zealand on the formation of \nsafe contained travel arrangements, with neighboring countries potentially following the Cook \nIslands\u2019 template. Cooperation with New Zealand border and health officials is well advanced.\n29. Lessons learned. The program applies lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in providing\n28 ADB. 2019.

", "10   \nCOVID-19  countercyclical  support,  as  well  as  from  support  during  the  2008\u20132009  global \neconomic crisis.33 These all demonstrate the critical need to support aggregate demand while \nprotecting the fiscal position through prioritized and well-targeted public expenditure programs. \nSupport in response to the global economic crisis showed the importance of complementary TA, \nparticularly to develop social protection programs for the most vulnerable. It also highlights the \ncrucial role of development partner coordination for a comprehensive crisis response.  \n \nC.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n30.  Government-led  coordination.  The  government,  through  its  oversight  committees, \nprovides strategic direction and coordination. The Government of New Zealand provided an \nadditional NZ$22 million to Cook Islands to support ERP phases I and II, as well as providing \nhygiene packs to vulnerable people and schools, food packs to the elderly, PPE and medical \nequipment to MOH. The New Zealand Ministry of Health directly supports its Cook Islands \ncounterpart, including providing assistance to meet international standards on COVID-19 testing. \nThe Government of the Cook Islands has received funds and donated medical supplies and \nequipment from Australia, New Zealand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and ADB. The World \nHealth Organization has provided training and technical guidance on critical preparedness, \nreadiness, and response actions for COVID-19. The government is actively engaged in the Pacific \nHumanitarian Pathway to support a regional response to the crisis.34 \n \n31.  ADB has been closely coordinating with development partners, such as the Government \nof New Zealand, on economic assessments and supporting the government during the crisis. ADB \nhas also held bilateral meetings with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) officials on \nmacroeconomic and fiscal issues to facilitate parallel AIIB cofinancing of $20 million. AIIB will \nutilize some of the due diligence and documentation provided by ADB to progress their operation.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability  \n \n32.  The  adverse  economic  and  fiscal  impacts  of  COVID-19  will  significantly  raise \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs. The financing needs of $16.0 million (equivalent to 5.1% of GDP) \nin FY2020 were met from cash reserves. An estimated $93.4 million (33.1%) is required in FY2021 \n(Table 5). This financing gap will be partially met with grants from New Zealand, ADB (from the \nDisaster Response Program and this CPRO) lending, and AIIB lending, with the government \nsupplementing these sources through use of cash reserves, which will come under pressure by \nthe end of FY2021.35 \n \n33.  The government has requested a loan of NZ$30,409,000 (equivalent to $20.0 million, as \nof 12 October 2020) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan \nwill have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. The average loan maturity, using annuity method based on 30% discount \nfactor, is 7.82 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.

Debt  sustainability.  The  Cook  Islands\u2019  public  debt  is  almost  wholly  external,  with \ndomestic debt at only 1% of total public debt. External public debt net of the Loan Reserve Fund \nfell from 26.4% of GDP in FY2016 to 16.7% by FY2019. Accumulated fiscal surpluses resulted in \nan increase in the general reserve to the equivalent of 19.8% of GDP at the end of FY2019. This \nreduced the need for external financing in the immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, \nalthough the heavy economic and fiscal impacts of COVID-19 will require debt financing from \nFY2021 onwards (with the general reserve exhausted), bringing net debt to an estimated 43.8% \nin FY2021. ADB\u2019s DSA shows that debt will maintain on a steady downward trend as the economy \nrecovers from the third quarter of 2021, even under conservative economic growth assumptions \nin the medium term. The loan is also not seen to add significantly to annual debt service \nobligations facing the government. Therefore, ADB\u2019s DSA concludes that the Cook Islands\u2019 public \ndebt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities will likely be contained over the medium term.36  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n35.  MFEM will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will oversee the implementation of ERP \nmeasures. MFEM will provide semiannual reporting to ADB to monitor the program outcomes and \nindicators, as specified in the design and monitoring framework, and social and gender monitoring \nmatrix. The implementing agencies include MOH, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the local \nbanking institutions. MFEM has agreements with implementing agencies outlining relevant criteria \nfor  each  initiative,  funding  mechanism,  and  financial  reporting  requirement.  Although  the \ngovernment faces general capacity constraints, the program risks are mitigated because the \ngovernment has successfully implemented ERP measures through existing systems.37 ADB will \nprovide TA resources to supplement the government\u2019s capacity in monitoring and evaluating \nsocial assistance programs, public financial management, and data collection (para. 27). The \nprogram implementation period is from April 2020 to January 2021.

The Cook Islands has a strong history of sound fiscal management, with \nstrong fiscal anchors supporting the limited use of debt and the accumulation of fiscal buffers. \nThe 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment noted the strength of the \nCook Islands\u2019 budget process and documentation, financial monitoring and reporting, financial \nreconciliation,  transparency  in  the  tax  system,  and  public  access  to  information. 39  The \nassessment  also  noted  weaknesses  in  multiyear  budget  planning,  commitment  controls, \nmonitoring fiscal risks, timely audit reports and procurement. The government has pursued \nreforms through its Public Financial Management road map for 2016\u20132020 supported by the IMF \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre.40 The following proven government systems are \nbeing used to implement the ERP: the tax system for income assessments, the electronic \nsettlements between the Treasury and the Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund, existing \nonline platforms for business applications and payments, and the existing fortnightly social welfare \nsystem for additional cash payments. The areas of implementation outside existing government \nsystems, such as concessional lending initiatives, are being managed on a commercial basis \nthrough domestic banks that are overseen by the Financial Services Commission. ADB will \nprovide  further  implementation  support  (para.  27).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to the government and MFEM. \n \n37.  Poverty. The rapid social assessment commissioned by ADB showed that COVID-19 has \nheightened existing social inequities in the Cook Islands. The potential disruption of social \nservices and increased social isolation heightened the vulnerability of the elderly (15% of the \npopulation), people with disabilities (28% have at least one form of disability), and people with \npre-existing conditions (24% of the population). The assessment stated that the government has \neffectively  targeted  its  income  support  to  the  working  population  most  likely  to  become \nunemployed and to those receiving social welfare payments who were already vulnerable. \nEmployment measures and grant support for sole traders are open to informal and migrant \nworkers (predominantly women) who are particularly vulnerable and may not have means of \nsupport during the business downturn. The free education initiatives will support the ability of \nformal and informal workers to improve lifetime incomes. Challenges remain for providing services \nto people with disabilities and those in the outer islands, which have much more limited access to \nhealth services and telecommunications, increasing their vulnerability to COVID-19 disruptions.  \n \n38.  Gender. The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The program ensures \nthat all women employers and employees have access to support, including (i) a wage subsidy \nfor all women in affected businesses, (ii) an unemployment benefit for all women at risk of losing \ntheir jobs, (iii) the assurance that all public servants (of which 55.8% are women) will continue to \nbe employed, (iv) the continuation of training opportunities being offered to women at similar rates \nto males, and (v) grant and credit assistance for women-owned businesses. Existing formal social \nprotection measures are continuing, including the pension scheme (51.8% to women) and the \ncaregivers\u2019, infirm, and destitute allowance (60.2% to women). The program has provided school \nclosure support payments, an electricity subsidy scheme that includes all households headed by \n \n38 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 IMF Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center. 2015.

Adverse impact of The Cook Islands is one of the most tourism-dependent countries in the region, with \nexogenous tourism receipts equivalent to 61.4% of GDP in 2019. With the shutdown of international \nshocks travel, GDP is estimated to have fallen 7.0% in FY2020, down from 5.3% growth in \nFY2019. If borders open to tourism in January 2021, then it is anticipated that GDP will fall \na further 15.4% in FY2021, with persistent and extreme risks to this outlook. These are \nthe largest economic contractions in Cook Islands history and will continue to have a \nprofound impact on unemployment, business viability, government finances, and Cook \nIslands society. The tourism-related sectors account for around 2,730 jobs (or 36.7% of \nthe total workforce) representing around half or all non-public sector employment\u2014these \njobs are at risk the longer the shutdown continues. The public sector is the other major \ncontributor to the economy, but government revenue will also face significant declines, \nfalling an estimated 41% in FY2021 as compared to FY2019 levels. Combined with \nstimulus measures, ADB estimates a fiscal deficit of 33.1% of GDP in FY2021 which will \nplace government cash reserves under increasing pressure, even with ADB support. The \nslow anticipated recovery in international tourism will continue to weigh on revenue in \nFY2022  and  beyond,  potentially  forcing  the  Government  to  undertake  significant \nexpenditure cuts. \n2. Countercyclical The Economic Response Plan (ERP) is divided into two phases: (i) NZ$42.6 million ($28.0 \ndevelopment million / 8.6% of GDP) for FY2020; and (ii) NZ$89.7 million ($59.0 million / 20.9% of GDP) \nexpenditures for FY2021. The ERP centers around four themes (Table 1). \nTable 1: Cook Islands Government: COVID-19 Economic Response Plan \nFY2020 FY2021\n(NZ$ m)  (NZ$ m) \nCOVID-19 Medical Response and preparation  7.3  3.9 \nLifeline \u2013 Supporting livelihoods  35.3  63.4 \nRecovery \u2013 Kickstarting Growth  N/A  19.0 \nTransformation \u2013 Moving to smarter greener economy  N/A  3.0 \nTotal in NZD  42.6  89.7 \n(Total in USD)  (USD28m)  (USD59m) \nThe ERP provides support the health system, payments for employment support, tax and \ncredit relief for businesses, free or subsidized re-training, personal income tax reductions, \ncash support to vulnerable households and those required to self-isolate, grants to \nbusinesses and sole traders (including in the informal sector), and capital for private sector \nlending.  \nGovernment support measures currently benefit 82% of private sector employment. \nSupport for those outside the formal sector including the estimated 4.3% to 12.4% of the \ntotal workforce in the informal sector, is provided through additional cash transfers to all \nstate pensions (universal coverage above age 60) and the child support payments \n(universal on a per-child basis), cash grants for sole traders and a dedicated Emergency \nHardship Fund for those not covered through these payments or via formal employment \nsupport mechanisms. The maintenance of government employment in remote islands \ns upports public sector workers. \n3. Pre-shock record Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cook Islands was implementing sound economic \nof generally sound policies. The fiscal balance has averaged 5.7% of GDP and GDP growth has averaged \nmacroeconomic 6.7% between FY2016\u2013FY2019. Successive fiscal surpluses have enabled the creation \nmanagement of fiscal buffers (the Stabilisation Account: NZ$56.7 million, 11.4% of GDP prior to COVID-\n19 in FY2020) and a sinking fund to smooth debt servicing requirements and aid in better \ncash management (the Loan Reserve Fund: NZ$21.4 million, 4.3% of GDP; around 2 \nyears-worth of debt servicing requirements in FY2020).  Revenue has performed strongly, \nespecially following tax reforms in 2014, with domestic revenue increasing from 39.1% of \nGDP in FY2016 to 41.0% of GDP in FY2019. Expenditure has been largely contained, \naveraging 37.5% of GDP in the FY2016\u201319 period. Public debt net of the Loan Reserve ", "22  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nFund had fallen from 26.4% in FY2016 to 16.9% of GDP in FY2020.a Price growth has \nbeen contained, with inflation averaging 0.2% between FY2016\u2013FY2019. \n4.  Structural reforms  Strong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented \n(including health  a COVID-19 outbreak. The Cook Islands Emergency Response Plan to COVID-19 has \nresponse)  laid out a pandemic preparedness and management plan, including tiered systems for \npandemic response and management and widespread testing. The Ministry of Health \n(MOH) activated its Health Emergency Response system on 22 January 2020, denying \nentry to travelers from affected countries later that month with the border closed on 24 \nMarch. Mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions and \nsocial distancing were enforced during the lockdown period.  Widespread testing began in \nmid-March, with the Cook Islands declaring itself COVID-19 free on 16 April 2020. \nLockdown restrictions were relaxed on 20 April. Community transmission of COVID-19 in \nNew Zealand on 11 August 2020 reinitiated border control measures, although social \ndistancing measures were not reimposed. Domestic travel remains open. \n \nThe fiscal response and economic support measures have been integrated into, and have \naimed to strengthen, existing systems, including social protections and public health \nservices. The Economic Response Plan (ERP) represents approximately 29.5% of GDP \nacross FY2020 and FY2021 and aims to preserve the capacity of the economic sector in \norder to accelerate an eventual economic recovery. It does this by allowing businesses to \nremain operational and preserve their payroll whilst meeting their debt obligations. The \nCOVID-19 (Economic Response) Act 2020 was passed to authorize and legislate policy \nresponses where needed, particularly those measures relating to credit and lending \ninitiatives. The Ministry of Health has indicated that it will likely continue and expand the \ncommunity-based health services commenced during the COVID-19 response, as well as \nimprovements to mental health services, and possible long-term reforms to elder and \ndisability care. \n \nThe Cook Islands has been a vocal and proactive partner in trying to establish an \ninternational \u2018travel bubble\u2019 with its major tourist source market of New Zealand, but no \ntimeline has been set. \n5.  Debt sustainability  The Cook Islands is a group C country and not rated as a high risk of debt distress prior \nto the pandemic, but suffers similar issues to other Pacific small island states on account \nof its vulnerability and narrow economic base. Following the pandemic, drawdowns of \nfiscal buffers will be complemented by an increase in debt financing from the ADB and \nparallel Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) operations (combined 14.2% of GDP) \nand will increase the debt-to-GDP ratio from 16.9% in FY2020 to 43.8% in FY2021, above \nthe government debt ceiling of 35%, although debt net of the Loan Reserve Fund will reach \nthis level by FY2024.b The Cook Islands does not have a central bank or direct access to \ndebt or bond markets. \n6.  Coordination with  The ADB has undertaken a macroeconomic assessment and DSA as the Cook Islands is \nthe IMF  not a member of the IMF. The AIIB has requested that the ADB assessment also be used \nto facilitate its operation. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund. \na  For the purposes of calculation, net debt is calculated as total outstanding public debt minus the funds already paid \ninto the Loan Reserve Fund. \nb  The government set a ceiling at 35% of GDP following the Manila agreement (1998) between the Cook Islands, \nNauru, New Zealand and the ADB (the major creditors).
