The  plant  will  use \ncirculating  fluidized  bed  (CFB)  combustion  boiler  technology\u2014a  more  environment-friendly \ntechnology\u2014and  provide  much-needed  base-load  power  to  the  Visayas  grid.  This  Project  will \nrepresent  the  first  collaboration  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Korean \nExport-Import Bank (KEXIM) under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2008 by the two \ninstitutions  as  part  of  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Financing  Initiative.  The  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nThe Visayas region in the Philippines\u2014an important center of industry, trade, education, \n2. \nand tourism for the country\u2014is facing an imminent power crisis. Intermittent blackouts now take \nplace  on  Cebu,  Panay,  and  Negros  islands  and  are  expected  to  become  more  frequent  until \nnew generation is brought on-line. Overreliance on the region's abundant geothermal resources \nand  low  tariffs,  which  were  not  allowed  to  rise  to  pay  for  new  capacity,  has  resulted  in \nunderinvestment in the region's power generation resources, particularly intermediate and base \nload.  As  a  result,  the  power  mix  in  the  Visayas  is  extremely  dichotomous,  with  71%  currently \ngenerated  from  geothermal  sources  and  22%  from  old,  very  inefficient,  and  less  environment-\nfriendly diesel power plants with variable costs for generation four or five times as high as the \nvariable  costs  of  geothermal.  Moreover,  tight  supply  conditions  are  an  obstacle  to  progress  in \nthe reform agenda for power of the Government of the Philippines (the Government) embodied \nin the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA). Specifically, implementation of the \nwholesale  electricity  spot  market  (WESM)  in  the  Visayas  grid  has  been  deferred  due  to  the \nassumption  that  spot  prices  would  be  excessively  high  if  the  supply\u2013demand  balance  is  not \nimproved prior to launch.  \n\nIn  November  2005,  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC)1  and  Power  Sector  Assets  and \n3. \nLiabilities  Management  Corporation  (PSALM) 2   conducted  an  open  and  competitive  public \nbidding  for  a  lease  covering  8.4  hectares  of  land  within  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant \nComplex.3 The primary bid document was a land lease agreement (LLA) requiring the winning \nbidder  to  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  a  base-load  merchant  power  plant  with  a  minimum \ncapacity of 100 MW on the leased land for a term of 25 years. KEPCO Philippines Holdings Inc. \n(KPHI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), the national \nelectric  utility  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  was  the  winning  bidder.  However,  SPC  Power \nCorporation (SPC) had been given the option to top the winning bid and it exercised its right to \ndo so. NPC, PSALM and SPC signed the LLA in December 2005. Subsequently, KPHI and SPC \n                                                 \n1   NPC,  a  state-owned  electricity  utility,  was  solely  responsible  for  electricity  generation  and  transmission  in  the \nPhilippines.  The  National  Transmission  Corporation  (TransCo)  was  formed  to  take  over  responsibility  of \ntransmission with the passage and implementation of the EPIRA. \n\n2   The EPIRA created PSALM to privatize certain generating assets of NPC.  \n3   The  complex  is  currently  operated  by  SPC  Power  Corporation  (previously  Salcon  Corporation)  under  a \nrehabilitation,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  agreement  with  NPC.  The  203.8  MW  complex  includes \nfour generating plants: 6 x 7.3 MW Cebu Diesel Plant I, 2 x 27.5 MW Land-Based Gas Turbines, the 50 MW Naga \nCoal-Fired Thermal Plant 1, and the 56.8 MW Naga Coal-Fired Thermal Plant 2. The agreement expires in 2012. \nThese  plants  are  quite  old  and  have  very  low  efficiencies.  In  2008,  NPC  announced  plans  to  either  \u201ctake  out  or \nrehabilitate\u201d the existing power plants after the agreement expires. \n\n\f2 \n\nformed  a  joint  venture  (60%/40%)  to  implement  the  Project,  and  the  LLA  was  assigned  to \nKSPC.  The  Project  was  granted  \"pioneer  status\"  and  given  an  array  of  investment  incentives, \nsuch as a 6-year income tax holiday starting from commercial operations and reduced tariffs for \nimported equipment. \n \n4. \nThe  first  unit  of  the  Project  was  originally  scheduled  to  begin  operation  in  December \n2008  and  the  second  unit  in  June  2009.  However,  construction  was  delayed  primarily  due  to \ndifficulties  KSPC  encountered  in  signing  power  sales  contracts  (PSCs)  with  local  distribution \nutilities. Most distribution utilities had PSCs with NPC, under which they were given NPC time-\nof-use rates that were very low compared with prices needed for cost recovery of a base-load \npower  plant.  Indeed,  the  rates  were  not  enough  for  NPC  to  cover  its  own  costs  of  providing \npower  from  its  geothermal  and  diesel  power  plants  and  its  power  purchase  agreements  with \nindependent  power  producers.  The  lack  of  PSCs  in  turn  meant  KSPC  had  difficulty  securing \ndebt financing for the Project. \n \n5. \nSeveral  developments  have  since  compelled  distribution  utilities  in  the  Visayas  to  sign \nPSCs with private generators. First, the supply shortage in the Visayas has become so critical \nthat virtually no reserves are available on the Visayas grid. Second, NPC is no longer signing \nnew PSCs, which means any distribution utility that anticipates load growth within its franchise \nwill  have  to  purchase  power  from  new  sources.  Third,  NPC  has  already  privatized  58%  of  its \ngenerating assets, and continues to sell its plants. Distribution utilities are therefore concerned \nthat  NPC  may  not  be  able  to  access  enough  power  to  meet  its  delivery  obligations  under  its \nPSCs. Finally, in February 2009 the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) approved raising the \ntime-of-use rates by 48% in the Visayas from P2.89/kilowatt-hour (kWh) to P4.27/kWh to more \naccurately reflect NPC's true cost of providing electricity.  \n \n6. \nWith  an  increasing  number  of  PSCs  signed  and  its  competitive  tender  for  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  services  completed,  KSPC  arranged  bridge  loans  with \nKEXIM and Korean Exchange Bank, and commenced construction on the Project in December \n2007.  KSPC  engaged  Sumitomo  Mitsui  Banking  Corporation  (SMBC)  as  lead  arranger  for  the \ncommercial  loan  syndication.  KEXIM  and  SMBC  began  due  diligence  on  the  Project  in  July \n2008.  KSPC  and  KEXIM  approached  ADB  for  assistance  in  December  2008.  ADB  joined  the \ndue  diligence  process  for  the  Project  in  late  January  and  obtained  concept  clearance  on  6 \nMarch 2009. \n \nA. \n\nSector Performance \n\n7. \nSince  1936,  NPC  has  been  the  state-owned  entity  responsible  for  generation  and \ntransmission of electricity in the Philippines under the development plans of the Department of \nEnergy  (DOE).  It  is  heavily  indebted  and  lacks  the  financial  and  technical  resources  to \nadequately invest in any new or even existing assets. Over the past decade, the Philippines has \ngradually  restructured  its  power  subsector  under  the  EPIRA,  which  outlines  comprehensive \nreforms  to  encourage  more  private  sector  investment  and  thus  relieve  the  Government\u2019s \nfinancial  burden  for  developing  the  national  power  system.  Such  measures  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  divert  its  scarce  financial  resources  to  much-needed  social  and  infrastructure \nprograms  that  are  more  focused  on  poverty  reduction.  Moreover,  greater  private  sector \ninvolvement  is  expected  to  improve  the  system's  efficiency  and  reliability,  as  well  as  increase \ncompetition.  This  would  result  in  more  affordable  electricity  tariffs  that  could  spur  economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty. \n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nThe EPIRA was designed to establish a model similar to that implemented in countries \n8. \nsuch as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. The main features include (i) a separate and \nprivately  operated  transmission  company,  (ii)  competing  generation  companies  bidding  into  a \nWESM,  (iii)  all  or  part  of  the  retail  market  open  to  competition,  and  (iv)  an  independent \nregulatory body. Appendix 2 contains a detailed description of the EPIRA and an update of its \nimplementation.  \n \n9. \nDue  to  the  country's  geographic  layout,  the  power  system  in  the  Philippines  is  divided \ninto  three  major  grids,  each  serving  one  of  the  country's  three  regions\u2014Luzon  (northern), \nVisayas  (central),  Mindanao  (south).  While  many  of  the  national  institutions  necessary  for \nreform have been established, the pace of implementation has varied across regions with Luzon \nleading  the  way.  The  following  particular  features  of  the  Visayas  grid  have  led  to  unique \nchallenges in implementation for the region. \n \n\n1. \n\nIndustry Structure \n\nGeneration.  In  2008,  approximately  71%  of  power  supplied  to  the  Visayas  grid  came \n10. \nfrom geothermal sources primarily from Leyte and Samar, 22% from diesel, and 6% from coal. \nCebu  currently  represents  about  46%  of  total  Visayas  demand;  but  with  only  25%  of  the  total \ncapacity it has the highest power deficit.  \n\n \n\n \nFuel Source \nCoal \nDiesel and Oil \nHydropower \nNatural Gas \nGeothermal \n \n\nTotal \n\nTable 1: Installed and Dependable Capacity, by Fuel Source, in the Visayas, 2008 \n \n\nInstalled Capacity \n\n  Dependable Capacity \n \n\nMW \n\n  Electricity Generation \n \n\nGWh \n\n% \n\nMW \n198 \n604 \n11 \n55 \n964 \n1,832 \n\n% \n\n11 \n33 \n1 \n3 \n53 \n100 \n\n155 \n419 \n10 \n48 \n861 \n1,493 \n\n% \n10 \n28 \n1 \n3 \n58 \n100 \n\n504 \n1,786 \n38 \n21 \n5,691 \n8,040 \n\n6 \n22 \n0 \n0 \n71 \n100 \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nNote: Figures may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics. \n \n11. \nPower generation in the Visayas by ownership is shown in Table 2. NPC controls about \n70%  of  generation  capacity  in  the  Visayas  through  outright  ownership  or  power  purchase \nagreements. Distribution utilities own almost all of the hydropower, and private companies own \nmost  of  the  diesel.  The  largest  private  generators  in  the  Visayas,  including  those  under \nindependent power producer arrangements, are Global Business Power Corp. (Global Power), \nSPC Corporation, and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy Development Corporation.4 The \n\n                                                 \n4   Global  Power  is  part  of  Metrobank  Group  and  owns  247  MW  of  installed  capacity.  It  is  also  part  owner  of  the  \n246  MW  Toledo  Expansion  Project  in  Cebu.  SPC  Corporation,  40%  owner  of  the  project  company,  owns  or \noperates 372 MW of generating capacity in the Visayas grid, 204 MW of which is under a rehabilitation, operation, \nmaintenance, and management agreement with NPC until 2012 and about 169 MW of which was recently won in a \nprivatization bid. Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) is 60% owned \nby  First  Gen,  a  Lopez  Group  company,  and  operates  659  MW  in  the  Visayas,  610  MW  of  which  is  the  Leyte  A \nGeothermal Plant, which has a power purchase agreements between NPC and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013\nEnergy Development Corporation that expires in 2021/2022. To ensure a competitive market, the EPIRA requires \nthat no one company, including its related entities, may own more than 30% of the installed generating capacity of \none grid or 25% of the total installed generating capacity nationwide.   \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n400 MW of Non-NPC dependable capacity includes 171 MW recently privatized under EPIRA's \nframework. Appendix 3 shows the ownership of each generation plant. \n \n\nTable 2: Installed Capacity and Generation in the Visayas by Ownership, 2008 \n\n \n \nOwnership \n\nNPC \nIPP with PPAs with NPC \nNon-NPC \n\nInstalled \nCapacity \n(MW) \n\n401 \n812 \n\n618 \n\n \n \n% \n\n22 \n45 \n\n34 \n\nDependable \nCapacity \n(MW) \n\n330 \n763 \n\n400 \n\n \n \n% \n\n22 \n51 \n\n27 \n\nTotal \n\n \nIPP  =  independent  power  producer,  MW  =  megawatt,  NPC  =  National  Power  Corporation, \nPPA = power purchase agreement. \nSource: Department of Energy, Power Statistics. \n\n1,493 \n\n1,832 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n \n12. \nThe WESM was launched in Luzon in 2006 and, year-to-date, an average of about 23% \nof power is being bought on it. In the Visayas, the WESM has been run on a trial basis since \nlate 2006, and ERC granted approval to launch it in 2008, but DOE delayed the official launch \ndue  to  the  tight  demand  and  supply  situation  in  the  Cebu,  Negros,  and  Panay  subgrid.  The \nshortage of supply cannot be readily rectified by transmission upgrades alone. The Visayas grid \ntherefore requires new generation, but private investors have been reluctant to build new plants \nwithout  a  functioning  spot  market,  government  guarantees,  or  long-term  power  purchase \nagreements.  Since  the  latter  two  options  run  counter  to  the  new  regime  that  policy  makers \nwould  like  to  implement,  extending  the  WESM  to  the  Visayas  is  essential  to  ensure  adequate \ngeneration to meet projected demand. Yet WESM implementation is likely to result in very high \nprices in the short term (which could be politically difficult) until, paradoxically, new generation \ncan be brought on-line to bring prices down. This impasse has been a barrier for several years \nto both implementation of sector reform and establishment of new generation capacity, leading \nto the power crisis in the Visayas today.  \n \nTo stabilize supply, in January 2009 DOE initiated implementation of the Visayas Supply \n13. \nAugmentation  Auction  Program,  to  be  administered  by  the  Philippine  Electricity  Market \nCorporation and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The auction program \nis a day-ahead market, which allows entities that have their own power supply to use their own \ngenerators and grid-connected customers to sell interruptible portions of their loads through an \nauction  process.  The  auction  program  is  a  form  of  demand  management  that  will  ease  the \nsupply  deficit  by  adding  as  much  as  137  MW  and  will  serve  as  an  interim  measure  until  the \nWESM  launch.  Generators  will  then  be  able  to  sell  power  to  the  WESM  as  well  as  through \nbilateral contracts with distribution utilities and progressively to large users and households after \nERC determines that all requirements have been met for \"open access\" (Appendix 2).  \n \n14. \nTransmission. NGCP is the private concessionaire charged with improving, expanding, \noperating,  and  maintaining  the  country's  transmission  system.  The  transmission  system  in  the \nVisayas is a long and narrow string of island grids covering Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Negros, Panay, \nand Samar, connected by submarine cables with limited capacity. While Leyte has a surplus of \ngeneration  available  given  its  rich  geothermal  resources,  constraints  on  transmission  capacity \nlimit  the  export  of  this  power  to  the  Cebu,  Negros,  and  Panay  subgrid.  Fortifying  submarine \ninterconnectors in the Visayas grid as the solution to the power crisis in the region is not viewed \nas  optimal  or  efficient  from  a  technical  or  economical  viewpoint,  because  it  is  very  costly  and \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nwould  not  substantially  improve  the  system's  reliability.  Thus,  DOE  advocates  building  more \ncapacity on each island as the best way to enhance the region's energy security (Appendix 3).  \n \n15. \nDistribution. The distribution of electricity remains a regulated activity under the EPIRA. \nDistribution utilities are given an exclusive franchise to operate in a particular geographic area. \nOf the 141 distribution utilities nationwide, 16 are private investor-owned utilities, 6 are owned \nby  local  government  units,  and  119  are  customer-owned  electric  cooperatives.  The  electric \ncooperatives are regulated by the National Electrification Administration (NEA); its mission is to \nexpand  rural  electrification;  provide  financial,  institutional  and  technical  support  to  the  electric \ncooperatives;  and  prepare  electric  cooperatives  to  operate  and  compete  in  a  deregulated \nenvironment.  \n \nAboitiz Power Corporation owns distribution utilities covering one third (about 350 MW) \n16. \nof the demand in the Visayas, including the Visayan Electric Company Inc., the second-largest \nprivately  owned  distribution  utility  in  the  Philippines.  Aboitiz  Power  Corporation  also  has \nsignificant equity interests in generation assets totaling 394 MW.5 Moreover, Vivant Corporation \nhas  interests  in  many  of  the  same  power  companies  as  Aboitiz  Power  Corporation,  including \nCebu  Energy  Development  Corporation,  Visayan  Electric  Company,  and  Cebu  Private  Power \nCorporation. Cross-ownership of generation and distribution in Luzon is often cited as a reason \nfor  high  electricity  prices  in  the  region.  By  providing  a  price  to  benchmark  power  rates,  the \nProject  is  viewed  as  an  important  check  on  the  possible  abuse  of  market  power  by  emerging \nvertically integrated utilities in the Visayas.  \n \n17. \nA  major  concern  in  the  reform  process  is  the  poor  financial  condition  of  many  electric \ncooperatives.  In  the  Philippines,  they  are  customer-owned,  nonprofit  organizations.  The  cost \nrecovery  mechanism  approved  for  them  is  based  on  cash  flow,  rather  than  the  performance-\nbased method approved for private investor-owned utilities, which considers depreciation and a \ncertain  return  on  assets.  The  rate  calculation  for  electric  cooperatives  provides  only  for \noperation  and  maintenance  expenditure  and  actual  debt service  requirements,  together  with a \n5% reinvestment surplus. Funds from this reinvestment account are for capital investment in the \nnetwork. However, historically the use of these funds has not been closely monitored, and some \nof the funds may have been diverted to cover increased operating expenses.  \n \n18. \nERC recognizes the flaws in the revenue-setting regime for electric cooperatives and will \napply  a  performance-based,  rate-setting  methodology  by  the  end  of  the  year.  In  addition,  to \naddress concerns about the solvency of electric cooperatives, PSALM assumed all outstanding \nobligations of electric cooperatives to NEA and other government agencies. NEA is authorized \nto guarantee the purchase of electricity by these electric cooperatives on the spot market. Also, \nNEA  now  offers  two  lending  windows  to  support  electric  cooperatives:  a  short-term  revolving \ncredit facility for shortfalls in monthly payments owed by electric cooperatives to power suppliers \nwith borrowed amounts due in 30 days, and a standby credit facility covering up to a 1 month \npayment with borrowed amounts due in 3 months.  \n \n19. \nAnother concern in the distribution sector is the distribution utilities' preparedness for the \nWESM and open access. The limited participation of electric cooperatives in the WESM relates \nto  practical  reasons.  Most  are  not  liquid  or  financially  viable  entities  and  have  historically \n                                                 \n5   These  include  50%  ownership  in  East  Asia  Utilities  Corporation,  which  operates  a  50  MW  bunker  C-fired  plant \nwithin  Mactan  Export  Processing  Zone  I;  60%  ownership  in  Cebu  Private  Power  Corporation,  which  operates  a  \n70 MW bunker C-fired plant in Cebu City; and 26% effective ownership in Cebu Energy Development Corporation, \nthe project company for the 264 MW Toledo Expansion Project. The EPIRA permits distribution utilities to source \n50% of their power from affiliated companies. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ninvested little in their nonpower infrastructure (in large part due to cash-flow constraints resulting \nfrom their regulatory framework). As such, many cooperatives are not able to meet the WESM\u2019s \nprudential or technical requirements. In addition, many cooperatives are more comfortable with \ntheir  long-established  custom  of  sourcing  directly  from  NPC  (rather  than  interacting  with  the \nWESM, which is seen as uncertain).  \n \nThe Government and international development agencies, including ADB,6 have offered \n20. \nseveral  assistance  programs  to  strengthen  the  management  and  technical  capabilities  of  the \nelectric cooperatives. NEA is also partnering with the WESM market operator to offer capacity \nbuilding  programs  to  the  cooperatives  to  develop  their  proficiency  to  participate  in  the  spot \nmarket and contract with power suppliers other than NPC. \n \n\n2. \n\nDemand-Supply Balance in the Visayas \n\n21. \nIn  2008,  the  Visayas  grid  had  1,493  MW  of  dependable  capacity  (about  11%  of  the \ncountry's total) of which only 1,125\u20131,277 MW were supplied to the grid at any one time. Peak \nload was estimated to be 1,176 MW.7 The grid has already reached the critical period, defined \nas the year when existing capacity cannot meet peak demand plus the reserve margin required \nby ERC.8 During 2007, 54% of days had yellow alerts and 5% red alerts, indicating that reserve \nshortages  were  forecast  even  with  the  dispatch  of  all  available  plants.  If  any  of  the  plants \nexperienced an unplanned shutdown, the entire Visayan grid would suffer power outages.  \n \n22. \nHistorically,  the  Visayas  relied  on  its  vast  geothermal  resources  for  its  power  needs, \nparticularly  for  base-load  power;  and  built  smaller  diesel  plants  on  each  island  for  peaking \npower. It has been a net exporter to Luzon until recently, but many years of below cost-recovery \ntariffs  led  to  underinvestment  in  intermediate  and  base-load  capacity.  When  geothermal \nresources  could  no  longer  fulfil  the  region's  rapidly  growing  demand  (about  6-9%  growth  per \nyear) new generation was not brought on-line in time. The region still has untapped geothermal \nresources,  but  existing  geothermal  plants  are  only  operating  at  a  fraction  of  their  rated \ncapacities9  and  new  geothermal  capacity  is  expected  to  come  on-line  very  slowly  relative  to \ndemand growth. Moreover, the geothermal resources are concentrated in Leyte and Samar, and \ntechnical constraints make evacuation of power from these areas difficult. \n \n23. \nTo meet the growing electricity demand in the area, the Visayas grid will require about \n869  MW  of  additional  capacity  through  to  2014.  However,  committed  projects  for  the  Visayas \ngrid, including this Project, offer a total of 320 MW. Indicative projects total 644 MW and include \nthe  announcement  by  Cebu  Energy  Development  Corporation 10   in  December  2007  of \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Rural  Electric  Cooperatives \n\n7   Registered capacities, dependable capacities, and peak demand may vary slightly throughout as several sources \n\n8   This is 23.4% for Luzon and the Visayas, comprising 2.8% load following and frequency regulation, 10.3% spinning \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\nprovide inconsistent information. \n\nreserve, and 10.3% back-up. \n\n9   Philippine  National  Oil  Company  commissioned  the  49  MW  Northern  Negros  Geothermal  Field  and  plant  in \nFebruary 2007. However, at present it is producing only 7MW due to a mineral blockage in the existing wells. The \nplant was shut down in May 2008 to clear the wells, which took about 9 months. After refurbishment, the plant is \nonly be able to produce 18 MW. Leyte A (590 MW) has been operating at about 88% capacity factor and recently \nhas been below its rated capacity due to a lack of steam. \n\n10  A  consortium  comprising  Global  Power  (footnote  8),  Formosa  Heavy  Industries  Corp.  of  Taiwan,  Aboitiz  Power \nCorp., and Vivant Power  Corp., is investing an estimated $450 million for the construction of a 246 MW (3 x 82) \ncoal-fired CFB facility. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nconstruction of a 246 MW (3 x 82) coal-fired power plant adjacent to an existing power plant in \nToledo, Cebu, with a target for completion of 2010.  \n \n \n24.  While  a  reserve  margin  of  about  25%  is  considered  appropriate  in  a  well-managed \nsystem  to  assure  continuous  supply,  experience  in  the  Philippines  suggests  that  a  higher \nmargin  is  needed.  This  is  particularly  applicable  in  the  Visayas  where  most  of  the  diesel \ngeneration  plants  are  very  old  and  the  region  does  not  have  a  strongly  meshed  transmission \nnetwork.  The  reserve  margin  in  2008  was  about  50%  on  an  installed  (or  nameplate)  capacity \nbasis. However, taking into account the derated capacities and availability of individual plants, \nthe  actual  reserve  margin  on  a  dependable  capacity  basis  was  closer  to  25%,  yet  power \noutages still occur in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid in particular. The power shortage in \nthe Visayas is projected to continue until 2011, when the Project and Global Power plants are \nexpected  to  come  on-line.  In  2011\u20132012,  a  slight  oversupply  is  projected.  However,  since  the \nProject is second in the merit order in terms of short-run marginal cost, it is expected to displace \nolder,  more  expensive  diesel  plants  and  be  fully  dispatched.  From  2013  onward,  demand \ngrowth will result in no oversupply. \n \nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n25. \nADB's  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Philippines  (2005\u20132007,  extended  to \n2010)11 was developed with significant input from the Government to highlight its priorities and \nkey  areas  for  partnership.  The  country  strategy  and  program  lists  inadequate  infrastructure, \nfiscal imbalance, and uncertain investment climate as binding constraints to more rapid poverty \nreduction.  The  Project  addresses  the  first  area  by  providing  much-needed  base-load  power \ncapacity.  It  addresses  the  second  area  by  not  putting  additional  strain  on  limited  government \nfinancial  resources  in  its  attempt  to  achieve  its  goals  in  infrastructure  investment.  The  Project \naddresses  the  third  area  by  introducing  an  international  sponsor  that  can  advocate  for  the \ndevelopment, integrity, and transparency of the reform process.  \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  also  advocates  more  cooperation  between  ADB\u2019s \n26. \npublic  and  private  sector  operations  to  enhance  investor  confidence  and  promote  private \ninvestment critical to offset fiscally constrained public investment. By supporting a private sector \ninvestor, the Project is a logical continuation of the initiatives of ADB's public and private sector \noperations (Southeast Asia Regional Department and Private Sector Operations Department) in \npower  subsector  development  and  reform  that  is  designed  to  promote  an  adequate,  well-\nregulated, and market-oriented power sector.  \n \nThe  Project  is  also  in-line  with  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan  for  the \n27. \nPhilippines,  2009\u20132010,  which  calls  for  interventions  to  support  critical  infrastructure  projects, \nincluding  power  generation,  and  cites  power  generation  as  a  specific  target  area  for  private \nsector operations. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan, Philippines 2009\u20132010. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n2. \n\nLong-Term Strategic Framework \n\nInfrastructure  is  a  core  area  under  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n28. \n(Strategy  2020). 12  Infrastructure  is  fundamental  to  achieving  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive \ngrowth, and Strategy 2020 recognizes that infrastructure gaps in the Philippines have held back \nindustrialization  and  job  creation.  As  part  of  its  work  in  infrastructure,  Strategy  2020  cites  that \nADB will \"help expand the supply of energy.\" The Project falls under this core area, and follows \nthis  particular  mandate.  In  addition,  the  Project  catalyzes  private  sector  engagement  in \ninfrastructure, and thereby utilizes one of the five drivers of change13 emphasized by Strategy \n2020. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnergy Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy 14   recognizes  that  coal-based  generation  will  grow  to  meet  the \n29. \nelectricity needs of the region. It states that ADB will encourage developing member countries to \nadopt  available  cleaner  technologies,  such  as  CFB,  and  assist  them  in  collaborating  with \ndeveloped countries on technology transfer. Under the policy, ADB may support subcritical coal \ntechnology  for  developing  member  countries  with  small-sized  grids  depending  on  oil-based \npower  supply  as  a  least-cost  option  to  diversify  fuel  sources  to  improve  system  reliability  and \nenergy security. The Project complies with ADB's Energy Policy along all of these dimensions. It \nwas developed based on the intent of the governments of the Philippines and Republic of Korea \nto  cooperate  in  activities  promoting  cleaner  power  generation  to  address  projected  power \nshortages  under  a  memorandum  of  understanding  signed  in  2004.  It  will  also  decrease \ndependency  on  expensive  and  inefficient  diesel  plants,  and  increase  reliability  of  the  Visayas \ntransmission system particularly in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n30. \nThe Project involves construction and operation of a 200 MW coal-fired power plant on \n100,000  square  meters  of  land  in  the  barangay  (district)  of  Colon,  in  the  city  of  Naga,  Cebu \nProvince,  about  20  km from  Cebu  City.  The  plant  consists  of  two  nominal  100  MW  units  (one \nunit can generate as much as 103 MW), each comprising a boiler, electrostatic precipitator for \nparticulate  matter  control,  steam  turbine  generator,  condenser,  and  circulating  water  system. \nThe  plant  will  use  CFB  boiler  technology,  known  as  \"cleaner  coal\"  technology  as  CFB  boilers \nare very low generators of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions.  \n \n31. \nThe  project  site  is  on  the  previous  ash  pond  disposal  area  of  the  existing  203.8  MW \nNaga Power Plant, which provides easy access to transmission lines and seawater for cooling \nand industrial use, as well as joint use of existing power plant infrastructure (access road, water \nintake  channel,  and  jetty  trestle).  The  plant  will  be  interconnected  to  the  Visayas  transmission \ngrid  through  a  new  138  kilovolt  substation  (the  New  Naga  Substation)  located  less  than  a \nkilometer  away.  KSPC  contracted  Doosan  Heavy  Industries  and  Construction  Co.,  Ltd.  (DHI) \nafter  a  competitive  bidding  process  for  plant  EPC.    DHI  will  supply  the  boilers,  which  will  be \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2008.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nFoster  Wheeler  \u201cCompact\u201d  CFB  combustion  boilers.  This  boiler  model  was  first  put  into \ncommercial operation in 1993. To date, more than 40 units are in operation including more than \n16  units  at  100  MW  and  larger,  which  burn  a  wide  variety  of  fuels.  Fuji  Electric  Systems  Co., \nLtd.  is  designing,  manufacturing  and  supplying  the  steam  turbine  generator.  It  is  a  major \nmanufacturer  of  turbine  generators  and  has  shipped  450  units  worldwide  since  1959,  totaling \nalmost 23,000 MW. Construction of the plant began in December 2007 with financing provided \nby  equity  and  bridge  loans.  As  of  May  2009,  55%  of  the  construction  milestones  were \ncompleted.  The  Project's  target  for  commercial  operation  is  February  2011  for  the  first  \n100 MW unit and May 2011 for the second 100 MW unit.  \n \n32. \nThe  Project's  feasibility  study  cited  a  preference  for  coal  as  the  fuel  source  because \nother  fuel  sources  were  deemed  either  not  easily  or  sufficiently  available  (hydro,  biomass, \ngeothermal,  natural  gas)  or  relatively  expensive  (solar,  wind,  oil).  The  configuration  of  two  \n100 MW units was deemed optimal due to the small size and projected demand of the Visayas \ngrid.15  Subcritical  technology  was  adopted  because  supercritical  is  technically  more  difficult  to \napply and not cost-effective for power plants below 500 MW. However, the use of CFB boilers \nallows the Project to utilize a wide range and lower cost fuel, and results in lower nitrogen oxide \nemissions and sulfur dioxide emissions. Appendix 3 contains further explanation of the Project's \nrationale for fuel source and technology. \n \nB. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n33. \nKSPC,  a  registered  Philippines  company,  is  60%  owned  by  KPHI  and  40%  owned  by \nSPC.  KPHI  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  KEPCO.  In  turn,  KPHI  owns  40%  of  SPC,  giving \nKEPCO  76%  effective  ownership  of  KSPC.  Both  KEPCO  and  SPC  have  a  long  history  of \noperating  power  plants  in  the  Philippines.  This  provides  added  comfort  not  only  with  technical \naspects of the plant's construction and operation, but also with the sponsors' ability to contribute \nto the reform process. \n \n34. \nKEPCO  is  the  Republic  of  Korea's  only  fully  integrated  electric  utility,  and  is  the \nmonopoly  operator  of  the  country's  power  transmission  and  distribution  system.  KEPCO \ngenerates  more  than  95%  of  the  electricity  consumed  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  through  \n68,000 MW of generation capacity operated by its six wholly owned generation companies, all \nseparately  corporatized  in  April  2001.  The  generation  sources  include  coal  (pulverized  and \nCFB),  gas  and  oil-fired  power  plants,  nuclear  power  plants,  and  hydroelectric  plants.  The \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  directly  and  indirectly,  owns  51%  of  KEPCO.  The \ncompany began its foreign expansion in the Philippines and has since implemented or is in the \nprocess  of  developing  projects  in  more  than  10  countries  including  Cambodia,  Indonesia, \nMongolia, and People\u2019s Republic of China. It will provide the primary technical, managerial, and \nfinancial support to the Project.  \n \n35. \nKEPCO  has  more  than  10  years  experience  with  power  projects  in  the  Philippines.  Its \nPhilippine operations, conducted through KPHI, provide approximately 16% of Luzon's installed \ngeneration  capacity  or  12%  of  the  Philippines'  installed  generation  capacity.  In  1995,  KEPCO \nwas  awarded  the  rehabilitation,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  contract  for  the  \n650 MW Malaya Thermal Power Plant in Rizal. Subsequently, a consortium led by KEPCO won \nthe  build-own-transfer  contract  for  the  construction  of  the  1,200  MW  Ilijan  Combined  Cycle \n\n                                                 \n15  The  largest  single  unit  in  the  Visayas  grid  is  77.5  MW.  For  a  grid  size  less  than  2,000  MW  and  with  the  peak \ndemand on any one island below 600 MW, an outage of a single unit above 100 MW would cause large disruptions \nto power supply and could damage the system. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPower Plant in Batangas. In June 2004, DOE and the Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry \nand  Energy  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  foster  cooperation  between  the \ntwo  countries  in  the  field  of  energy;  promote  the  development  of  environment-friendly  power \ngeneration through the use of cleaner technology; and assist the Philippines in addressing the \npower  supply  shortage  in  Cebu.  KEPCO's  participation  in  this  Project  represents  the  first \nundertaking under this memorandum of understanding. \n \n36. \nSPC was organized in 1994 after a consortium led by Salcon Holdings Philippines Inc. \nwas  awarded  a  rehabilitation,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  contract  for  NPC\u2019s \nNaga  Power  Plant  Complex.  In  2005,  KPHI  bought  Salcon's  shares  and  became  the  largest \nshareholder \nthe  \n146.5 MW Panay and 22 MW Bohol diesel power plants with its bid offer of $5.86 million.  \n \nC. \n\nIn  November  2008,  SPC  won \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\nfor  privatization  of \n\nin  SPC. \n\nthe  bid \n\n37. \nThe  Project  supports  sustainable  growth  in  the  Visayas  region  by  increasing  the \navailability of reliable and competitively priced power to help alleviate the current power supply \nshortage  without  additional  fiscal  burden  on  the  Government.  The  Project  will  revitalize \nimplementation  of  the  Government's  reform  agenda  for  the  power  subsector,  which  aims  to \nlower electricity costs over time by increasing competition and efficiency through private sector \ninvestment in the sector. The construction and operation of a plant by a large and experienced \nglobal  energy  provider  using  more  environment-friendly  technology  and  adhering  to  ADB \nsafeguards will result in the achievement of operating efficiencies that are consistent with global \nindustry  best  practices  and  more  environmentally  sound  power  generation.  Moreover,  it  will \nprovide  a  demonstration  effect  for  future  greenfield  power  plants  (particularly  coal-fired)  in  the \nPhilippines under the new regulatory environment. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n38. \nLand  Lease  Agreement. KSPC is the lessee under a 25-year lease of the project site, \nunder  which  it  has  an  obligation  to  build  a  new  power  plant  of  at  least  100  MW  capacity  by \nDecember 2011. KSPC has the option to extend the lease another 25 years. Upon expiration, \nall immovable assets become the property of NPC and PSALM. KSPC, NPC, PSALM, and SPC \nsigned a co-use agreement that addresses the joint use of certain existing infrastructure of the \npower plant site (access road, water intake channel, and the jetty trestle). The jetty and the jetty \nextension (a component of the Project) is located on foreshore land, which NPC will lease from \nthe  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources.  The  co-use  agreement  grants  KSPC \naccess to the foreshore area for use of the jetty. \n \nEngineering, Procurement, and Construction. The EPC contract was awarded to DHI \n39. \nthrough  a  qualified  bidding  process.  DHI  is  part  of  the  Doosan  group,  one  of  the  oldest  and \nlargest  conglomerates  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  specializing  in  infrastructure  support.  DHI  has \nbuilt  over  400  nuclear,  thermal,  and  combined  cycle  power  plants  around  the  world  since  its \nestablishment  in  1962.  For  the  Project,  DHI's  obligation  includes  constructing  and  testing  the \nplant and transmission line, and importing all required equipment.  \n \n40. \nOfftake Arrangements. KSPC's target is to contract 170 MW, or more than 91% of net \noutput. The contract period is 10 years starting from commercial operation date (COD). Under \nthe  PSCs,  the  buyer  will  pay  KSPC  for  a  minimum  number  of  kilowatt  hours  at  the  contract \nprice,  based  on  the  Project's  long-run  average  cost  adjusted  for  inflation,  the  dollar/peso \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nexchange  rate,  and  coal  prices.  The  PSCs  will  not  have  the  backing  of  any  government \nundertaking  since  the  EPIRA  prohibits  the  issuance  of  sovereign  guarantees  for  offtake \narrangements. The PSCs are similar and differ only in the contract quantities and capacity caps. \nERC  approved  the  initial  draft  of  the  PSCs,  and  is  expected  to  approve  amendments  to  the \nPSCs requested by lenders. \n \n41. \nKSPC  has  signed  nine  PSCs  for  a  total  contracted  capacity  of  171.1  MW.  The \ndistribution utilities are primarily in central Negros and Cebu provinces. In addition to the eight \nelectric  cooperatives,  KSPC  has  contracted  15  MW  with  Mactan  Electric  Company,  a  private \ninvestor-owned utility, and 37 MW with iN2Power, a newly formed wholesale power aggregator \nthat  combines  supply  from  generators  to  match  the  full  load  profile  (base  load,  intermediate, \npeak) of energy buyers. \n \n \n\nItem\nNEA rating \nCustomers (number)\nHousehold Level of Electrification\n\nTable 3: Data on Electric Cooperatives \n(figures for 2007 unless indicated otherwise) \n \nCENECO\n\nCEBECO II\n\nNOCECO\n\nCEBECO I\n\nA+\n108,801\n42%\n\nA+\n101,290\n57%\n\nA+\n156,317\n71%\n\nA+ (2004)\n118,861\n87%\n\nNORECO 1 NORECO II\nA+ (2006)\n104,323\n53%\n\nA+\n48,411\n31%\n\nVRESCO\n\nA+\n88,989\n46%\n\nOperating revenue (P million)\nOperating margin (P)\nNet margin (P)\nOperating margin 2006 (P)\nNet margin 2006 (P)\n\n536\n35,280,819\n7,176,756\n(31,983,386)\n(60,257,080)\n\n775\n17,277,722\n\n2,506\n76,290,057\n1,045,809 (41,111,512)\n35,561,697\n8,921,658\n(77,415,951)\n(9,835,314)\n\n782\n47,749,994\n7,149,974\n33,479,069\n14,674,362\n\n203\n(322,141)\n(8,125,393)\n(6,297,036)\n(7,214,706)\n\n931\n26,581,686\n\n686\n11,253,915\n908,575 (16,185,864)\n(2,922,924)\n713,285 (26,259,400)\n\n17,627,594\n\n7,000\n21,967\n32%\n3.85\n56%\n9%\n201\n\n553,771,302 150,003,728\n10,000\n31,210\n32%\n3.87\n55%\n11%\n338\n\n107,612,696 165,324,916\n12,000\n36,709\n33%\n3.77\n51%\n10%\n226\n\nActual kWh purchased\nKSPC volume from the project (kW)\nActual peak load (kW) \nKSPC volume % of peak load\nActual power supply cost\nLoad factor\nSystem loss \nNumber of employees\n(  )  =  negative,  kW  =  kilowatt,  kWh  =  kilowatt-hour,  CEBECO  I  =  Cebu  I  Electric  Cooperative  Inc.,  CEBECO  II  =  Cebu  II \nElectric  Cooperative  Inc.,  CENECO  =  Central  Negros  Electric  Cooperative,  Inc.,  NEA  =  National  Electrification \nAdministration,  NOCECO  =  Negros  Occidental  Electric  Cooperative  Inc.,  NORECO  I  =  Negros  Oriental  I  Electric \nCooperative  Inc.,  NORECO  II  =  Negros  Oriental  II  Electric  Cooperative  Inc.,  VRESCO  =  VMC  Rural  Electric  Service \nCooperative, Inc.  \nNote:  NEA  ratings  are  based  on  a  point  system  to  measure  an  electric  cooperative's  financial  viability  and  performance. \nAreas  of  consideration  include  payment  history  of  NEA  loans,  system  loss,  collection  efficiency,  payment  history  to \npower suppliers and TransCo or NGCP, nonpower cost, amount of energization, and financial results.

If  the  WESM  is  not  launched  by  the  Project's  COD,  KSPC  will  sell  any  excess \nand unnominated power through the Visayas Supply Augmentation Auction Program, to NGCP \nto  serve  as  ancillary  services,  or  on  an  ad-hoc  basis  to  large  customers  connected  directly  to \nthe grid. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nCoal  Supply.  Fuel  is  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal  supplied  to  the  Project  under  \n43. \ncoal  supply  contracts  with  two  Indonesian  coal  companies  selected  after  screening  potential \nsuppliers  and  several  rounds  of  negotiations.  KSPC  has  also  entered  into  backup coal  supply \narrangements with Philippine National Oil Company-Exploration Corporation. \n \n44. \nTransmission.  KSPC  and  NGCP  will  enter  into  a  transmission  service  agreement  for \nthe  transmission  of  electricity  generated  by  the  Project.  In  addition,  KSPC  is  obliged,  under \nmemorandum  of  understanding,  to  construct  and  cover  the  cost  of  the  transmission  line  to \nconnect the power plant to the new Naga Substation (0.7 km), and turn it over to TransCo upon \ncompletion. In turn, NGCP will provide engineering and right-of-way acquisition services for the \nassociated  line.  NGCP  will  build  a  new  Naga  substation  at  its  own  cost  to  enable  the  full \ndispatch of the Project's power. If the substation is not completed by the time the plant is ready \nfor commissioning, NGCP will implement a contingency plan and bear the costs for building a \ntemporary line to the old Naga Substation. \n \n45. \nOperation  and  Maintenance.  KSPC  will  contract  operation  and  maintenance  to  East-\nWest  Power,  one  of  KEPCO's  six  generation  companies.  East-West  Power  has  experienced \noperating  power  plants  overseas.  In  addition  to  daily  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  plant, \nEast-West  Power  will  be  responsible  for  security,  safety,  hiring  and  training  of  personnel, \nenvironmental  compliance,  procurement  of  consumables  and  spares,  and  major  maintenance. \nMajor  overhauls,  intermediate  overhauls,  and  preventive  maintenance  will  follow  an  alternate \ncycle between units to minimize plant outages and smooth maintenance expenditures.  \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n46. \nThe  emissions  guaranteed  in  the  EPC  contract  are  below  Philippine  standards  and \nWorld  Bank  guidelines  for  all  pollutants.  CFB  combustion  boilers  are  inherently  very  low \ngenerators  of  nitrous  oxide  emissions  due  to  their  low  combustion  temperature  and  staged \ncombustion, and are capable of removing up to 98% of sulfur dioxide emissions. \n\n \nTable 4: Comparison of Project Emission Requirements with World Bank and Philippine \nRequirements \n\nPollutant \n\nWorld Bank Standard a \n\nPhilippine Standardb   Project Requirement \n\nParticulate \nMatter \n\n50 mg/Nm3 \n\n0.2 tons/day/MWe  \n2,000 mg/Nm3 \n\nSO2 \n\nCO \n\n150 mg/Nm3 \n\n700 (245 ppm) \n\n40 mg/Nm3 (@ 12% CO 2 \ndry) \n\n200 ppm (@ 6% O2 dry) \n(approx. 572 mg/Nm3)  \n\n\u2014 \n\n500 mg/Nm3 \n\n320 ppm (@ 6% O2 dry) \n\nNOX \n\n750 mg/Nm3 \n\n150 ppm (@ 6% O2 dry) \n(approx. 308 mg/Nm3) \nCO = carbon monoxide, NOX  = nitrogen oxides, SO 2  = sulfur dioxide, mg/Nm3 = milligrams per normal cubic, \nMWe = megawatts of electrical output, ppm = parts per million. \na World Bank Group. 1998.

The  Philippines  nearly  doubled \nto  \n80.5 million tons in 2004 from 43.9 million tons in 1991. However, the Philippines' share of the \ntotal world emission of carbon dioxide remains small. The Philippines accounts for only 0.3% of \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions although it comprised 1.3% of the world's population in 2004. \n \n48. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  A  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The \nenvironmental impacts were assessed and the Government approved the environmental impact \nassessment  on  5  December  2005.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nprepared and, in accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), disclosed to the \npublic through the ADB website on 10 March 2009. \n \n49. \nThe environment management plan (EMP) is part of the Project\u2019s environmental impact \nassessment and outlines measures to be implemented during construction and operation of the \nProject to mitigate air pollution, noise, waste generation (liquid effluents, thermal pollution, and \nash),  water  quality  deterioration,  and  traffic.  The  EMP  also  outlines  a monitoring  program  that \nwill  involve  continuous  emissions  monitoring;  installation  of  equipment  to  monitor  wastewater \nquality;  and  ambient  air  quality  monitoring  systems  to  measure  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide, \nand  dust  content  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  plant.  Annual  environmental  audits  will  be \nundertaken  by  a  third  party  duly  accredited  by  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources.  A  multipartite  monitoring  team  was  established  comprising  contractors,  local \nconsultants, and officials of relevant government agencies and local government units that will \nbe  responsible  for  overseeing  monitoring  activities.  KSPC  has  allocated  funds  for  EMP \nimplementation.  Results  of  environmental  due  diligence  indicate  that  the  mitigating  measures \nidentified in the environmental impact assessment and EMP, including environmental monitoring \nduring construction, are being properly implemented with no adverse or detrimental effect on the \nenvironment.  The  construction  of  the  0.7  km  transmission  line  will  not  cause  any  significant \nenvironmental  impact  and  will  not  cross  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Ash  will  be \ndisposed  as  raw  material  for  cement  manufacturing  through  agreement  with  Cebu  Provincial \nGovernment  (CPG).  In  emergencies,  ash  will  be  transferred  from  the  silo  in  a  humidified  form \nand stored in the emergency ash pond on-site, lined with high density polyethylene (HDPE) to \nensure no ground seepage of the wet ash. In the event that alternative ash disposal is needed \nin  the  future,  any  proposed  site  will  be  required  to  meet  ADB's  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards requirements and approval. \n \nDue  diligence  of  the  Project's  environment-related  activities  confirms  that  the  Project \n50. \nmeets ADB's environmental requirements as well as national and local requirements. Site visits \nindicate  that  adequate  environment,  health,  and  safety  management  systems  are  in  place. \nImplementation  of  the  EMP  during  operation  should  ensure  that  any  adverse  or  significant \nimpacts will be adequately addressed. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nLabor,  Health,  and  Safety.  The  Project  will  provide  employment  opportunities  for \n51. \nqualified  local  residents,  and  contribute  directly  and  indirectly  to  business  opportunities  in  the \narea. Antipollution technology and devices will be installed to prevent air pollutants from going \ninto  nearby  communities.  KSPC  will  monitor  the  health  of  local  communities,  contribute  to  the \nimprovement of local health services and facilities, and conduct periodic medical missions that \nwill distribute free medicines. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. Due diligence was conducted on the \n52. \nNaga  land  (the  plant  site),  which  used  to  be  occupied  by  22  families  with  no  legal  title.  In \nOctober 2008, 17 families voluntarily relocated to a site provided by the Naga local government. \nKSPC  provided  financial  assistance  and  the  labor  force  needed  to  construct  homes  for  the \nrelocated  families.  KSPC  also  provided  basic  infrastructure  and  utilities  at  the  relocation  site, \nsuch  as  new  access  roads,  and  power  and  water  supplies.  The  remaining  5  families  claim  to \nhave  legal  titles  and  have  partially  encroached  on  the  leased  land.  While  awaiting  a  judicial \nresolution,  the  disputed  areas  have  been  fenced  off  from  the  rest  of  the  plant  site  and  the \nfamilies remain unaffected. Due diligence confirms that no other issues relate to those affected \nby  the  construction  of  the  KSPC  plant  on  the  Naga  land.  In  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  KSPC  will  comply  with  ADB's  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy.  \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  evacuate  power  to  a  138-kilovolt  transmission  line  requiring  land  and \nright-of-way acquisition; TransCo prepared a land acquisition and resettlement plan. The KSPC \ntransmission line (the project transmission line) extends 0.7 km and connects to the NGCP line. \nAcquisition of public and private land for the project transmission line will affect assets of people \nliving  close  to  the  project  site,  hence  the  overall  project  category  is  \"B\"  with  respect  to  ADB's \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  A  short  resettlement  plan  for  this  project  component \nwas  prepared  as  part  of  the  main  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  Activities  under  the \nshort resettlement plan will mitigate adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition, \nand establish an ongoing relationship with those affected throughout the life of the Project. \n \n54. \nCommunity  Engagement.  KSPC  implements  projects  and  activities  to  establish  a \nharmonious  relationship  with  the  host  community  through  its  social  development  plan  and  its \ncorporate  social  responsibility  policy.  The  social  development  plan  covers  KSPC  interventions \nand donations in areas such as health, sanitation, nutrition, and education to support programs \nby  the  local  government  unit  that  favor  various  project  stakeholders.  An  annual  budget  of \nP240,000  is  allocated  for  implementation.  The  recipients  of  KSPC's  community  programs  are \nresidents of Colon barangay and include the relocated families. Moreover, the local government \nunit  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project  through  additional  financial  resources  provided  by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code and Energy Regulations 1-94 from DOE. KSPC will \nassist the municipality in obtaining the funds provided by these codes. \n \n55. \nIndigenous People. No indigenous people live in Naga City. Most of the households in \nthe city classify themselves as Cebuano. No indigenous people will be affected by the Project; \nhence, the Project is categorized as C under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\nADB  will  provide  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $120,000,000  to  KSPC  without  government \n\n56. \nguarantee from ADB's ordinary capital resources.  \n \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nJustification \n\n57. \n \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n\n15 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nfor \n\nlists \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  much  needed  electricity  to  an  economically  promising \narea  of  the  Philippines  with  a  current  power  shortage,  and  will  thereby  support \nthe country\u2019s continued growth and contribute to reduced poverty in the region.  \nThe  Project  is  directly  in-line  with  the  Government's  road  map  for  the  energy \nsector under the Philippine Energy Plan for 2005\u20132014.16 By demonstrating that \na  greenfield  project  can  be  successfully  financed  and  operated  in  light  of \nimminent market-oriented sector reforms, the Project will provided much-needed \nsupport for the Government's reform agenda. By addressing the region's power \nsupply  shortage,  the  Project  will  catalyze  the  pace  of  reform  as  set  out  by  the \nEPIRA, which has stalled due to the assumption that launching the WESM during \na shortage would result in politically untenable spot prices. \nThe Project will have a demonstration effect for future private sector investments \nin  greenfield  coal-fired  power  generation  under  the  new  regulatory  regime.  The \nProject,  through  the  expertise  of  its  sponsors  and  compliance  with  ADB \nsafeguards, will be a model in the application of cleaner technologies to coal-fired \npower  plants  of  this  size.  Moreover,  the  finance  structures  used  for  the  Project \ncan serve as a model to finance future greenfield coal projects. \nADB's  country  strategy \ninadequate \nthe  Philippines  (2005\u20132007) \ninfrastructure,  fiscal  imbalance,  and  uncertain  investment  climate  as  binding \nconstraints to more rapid poverty reduction. The Project addresses the first area \nby  providing  much-needed  base-load  power  capacity,  and  the  second  area  by \nnot  adding  strain  to  the  limited  financial  resources  of  the  Government.  ADB's \nparticipation  will  give  added  assurance  to  investors  and  cofinanciers  that  the \nGovernment will more likely support this Project throughout its life due to ADB's \ninvolvement, and thereby improve the sector's uncertain investment climate. \nThe  Project  is  in-line  with  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan  for  the \nPhilippines, 2009\u20132010, which calls for interventions designed to support critical \ninfrastructure projects including power generation, and cites power generation as \na specific target area for private sector operations. \nBy supporting a private sector investor, the Project is a logical continuation of the \ninitiatives of ADB's public and private sector operations (Southeast Asia Regional \nDepartment  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department)  in  development  and \nreform of the power subsector that is designed to support an adequate and well-\nregulated  market-oriented  sector.  Specifically,  ADB's  support  for  KEPCO  and \nSPC's  first  merchant  power  plant  will  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the \ngeneration sector by reducing its oligopolistic structure. These sponsors are likely \nto contribute to the development and viability of the wholesale electricity market \nand  the  integrity  of  the  reform  process.  In  time,  the  improved  competitive \nenvironment  is  expected  to  result  in  more  affordable  and  sustainable  electricity \ntariffs that could stimulate economic activity and reduce poverty. \nThe  Project  falls  under  one  of  the  mandates  of  Strategy  2020,  which  cites  that \nADB will \"help expand the supply of energy\" as part of its work in infrastructure, a \ncore  area  under  ADB's  long-term  strategy.  Infrastructure  is  fundamental  to \nachieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth, and Strategy 2020 recognizes \nthe  Philippines  specifically  have  held  back \nthat \n\ninfrastructure  gaps \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n16 Department of Energy, Philippines. 2005.

In addition, the Project catalyzes private sector \nengagement  in  infrastructure,  and  thereby  utilizes  one  of  the  four  drivers  of \nchange emphasized by Strategy 2020. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Project  complies  with  ADB's  Energy  Policy.  It  will  adopt  CFB,  a  more \nenvironment-friendly  technology,  and  will  improve  system  reliability  and  energy \nsecurity through diversification away from oil-based generation in the context of a \nsmaller  size  grid.  Due  diligence  confirms  that  coal-based  generation  using \nsubcritical boiler technology is the least-cost option, and that adequate mitigation \nequipment and measures are incorporated in the project design. \nADB's participation is needed to fill a gap in the present financial environment in \nwhich sources of funding previously available have abated due to outside market \nfactors and the exposure limits of banks to the Project's sector.  \nKEXIM  brought  the  Project  to  ADB's  attention  based  on  the  signing  of  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  by  ADB  and  KEXIM \nfor \nnonsovereign  financing  under  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Financing  Initiative. \nCooperation and cofinancing with bilaterals is a key agenda item promoted under \nADB's recent general capital increase. If approved, the Project will represent the \nfirst collaboration between ADB and KEXIM under this initiative. \n\nin  June  2008 \n\n(x) \n\nAnticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\n58. \nIntegrity checklists were completed for KEPCO, the shareholding companies (KPHI and \nSPC), and their management, based on internet searches, press reviews, and use of the World \nCheck  database.  No  issues  or  concerns  were  found.  KSPC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money \nLaundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require KSPC to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation  between  ADB  and  KSPC  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 17   the \n59. \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nKSPC.  No  funding  will be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.

They reflect distortions \nfrom  high-priced  take-or-pay  contracts  that  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC)  signed  with \nindependent power producers (IPPs) in the early 1990s to alleviate the country\u2019s power crisis. \nHowever  the  Asian  financial  crisis  suppressed  economic  growth  and  reduced  electricity \ndemand, leading to a significant surplus of power-generating capacity, especially in Luzon. As a \nresult NPC became heavily indebted and could not adequately maintain its own plants.  \n \n2. \nTo  reduce  public  debt,  improve  efficiency  in  the  sector,  and  encourage  competition  to \nbring  down  the  cost  of  electricity,  the  Government  embarked  on  a  market-oriented  reform \nprogram. The restructuring program is progressing steadily to meet its targets, although much \nlater than originally planned. The reform plan embodied in the Electric Power Industry Reform \nAct of 2001 (EPIRA) mandated a radical restructuring and includes the following actions: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nseparate the transmission and generation functions and unbundle power rates; \ncreate  the  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation \n(PSALM)  to  take  ownership  of  and  manage  the  orderly  privatization  of  NPC \ngeneration  and  transmission  assets  and  the  power  purchase  agreements  with \nprivate IPPs; \ncreate a wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) where all energy generated is \ntraded between generators and distribution utilities or retailers; \n\n(iv)  mandate  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  to  replace  the  Energy \n\nRegulatory Board as the industry's independent regulator; and \nintroduce  competition  in  the  retail  supply  of  electricity  (open  access),  subject  to \ncertain conditions, starting with large electricity users and eventually extending to \nthe supply of electricity to households. Among the conditions are privatization of \nat  least  70%  of  the  total  capacity  (or  4,336  megawatts  [MW])  of  the  NPC \ngeneration  assets  in  Luzon  and  the  Visayas,  and  transfer  of  management  and \ncontrol of at least 70% of the IPPs to independent IPP administrators. \n\n \n3. \nUnbundling. Rates were unbundled into four components on consumers' electricity bills: \n(i)  generation,  (ii)  transmission,  (iii)  distribution,  and  (iv)  the  universal  charge.  Generation \ncharges  are  passed  through  based  on  the  blended  weighted  average  of  a  distribution  utility's \nsources  of  power  supply.  For  generation  based  on  bilateral  contracts,  ERC  must  approve  the \nunderlying contracts. The approval process includes public hearings where consumers from the \ndistribution utility's franchise may raise objections. Generation purchased from the spot market \nis  based  on  WESM  prices.  Transmission  charges  are  also  passed  through  based  on  ERC \napproval  of  the  capital  budget  of  the  National  Grid  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  (NGCP)  for \nevery 5-year regulatory period, the second of which spans 2006\u20132010. The universal charge is \ncollected  for  specific  purposes  including  missionary  electrification,  environmental  charges, \npayment  of  NPC\u2019s  stranded  debt  and  costs, 1   and  payment  of  distribution  utilities\u2019  stranded \ncosts. This charge is collected by distribution utilities as a pass-through charge.  \n \n\n                                                \n \n1   EPIRA permits NPC, PSALM, and distribution utilities to recover, through a universal charge, costs associated with \ntheir take-or-pay contracts by the Energy Regulatory Board as of 31 December 2000. These costs take two forms: \nstranded  debt  and  stranded  costs.  Stranded  debt  refers  to  unpaid  obligations  of  NPC,  while  stranded  cost  is  the \ndifference  between  the  NPC-contracted  purchase  price  and  the  actual  price  at  which  electricity  was  sold.  The \namount of stranded debt and costs  that NPC or PSALM  would seek to  recover  would  depend on several factors \nincluding the proceeds from the privatization program. The imposition of the stranded cost charges on customers \nwithin the universal charge, and the period of such imposition, will require ERC approval. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2     21 \n\nPrivatization.  In  2001,  NPC's  transmission  assets  were  spun  off  to  the  state-owned \n4. \nNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo) to assume the electrical transmission functions of \nNPC  until  privatization.  After  three  failed  attempts,  PSALM  held  a  fourth  round  of  bidding  in \nDecember 2007 to privatize the operation of the country's power transmission system under a \n25-year  concession.  Two  bidders  participated  and  a  consortium  comprising  State  Grid \nCorporation of China2 and two local companies, Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp. and Calaca \nHigh Power Corp, won with its bid of $3.95 billion. The concession contract was awarded on 1 \nDecember 2007 and after NGCP obtained the necessary congressional franchise, it took over \noperations on 15 January 2009. NGCP will assume all of TransCo's obligations to the Project, \nincluding construction of the New Naga Substation and engineering services for the associated \ntransmission line connecting the substation to the Project.  \n \nNGCP  manages  the  central  dispatch  of  power  with  the  aim  to  ensure  safety,  power \n5. \nquality,  stability,  reliability,  and  security  of  the  transmission  grid.  As  the  system  operator  it \nschedules enough power generation to meet expected power demand throughout the day with \nadequate  reserve  margins  for  contingencies,  and  arranges  for  the  provision  of  ancillary \nservices. For grids without the WESM, NGCP prepares and implements the generation dispatch \nschedules. For grids with the WESM, the system WESM operator is part of NGCP and provides \nreal-time system information to the market operator. The market operator then provides NGCP \nwith a generation dispatch schedule according to bids submitted by the generation participants. \nAll  energy,  including  quantities  sold  through  bilateral  contracts,  is  dispatched  by  the  system \noperator. \n \n6. \nAs of 31 May 2009, 16 of NPC's power plants with a total capacity of 2,168 MW in Luzon \nand  the  Visayas  had  been  sold  and  turned  over.  This  represents  about  58%  of  the  operating \ncapacity  in  Luzon  the  Visayas  that  can  be  counted  toward  the  70%  needed  to  declare  open \naccess.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supported  privatization  of  the  600  MW  Masinloc \ncoal-fired  thermal  power  plant  bought  by  AES  Corporation  of  the  United  States,  the  largest \nasset that has been turned over to date, and is considering support for the purchase of the 748 \nMW  Tiwi-MakBan  geothermal  power  project,  which  was  turned  over  in  May  2009.  The \nprivatization process experienced a setback when Suez-Tractabel S.A. backed out of the sale of \nthe  Calaca  coal\u2013fired  thermal  power  plant  because  the  power  plant  had  deteriorated  since  its \nbidding date in October 2007.3 PSALM entered into a negotiated bid for Calaca and reawarded \nthe plant in July 20094. PSALM is targeting to reach the 70% privatization threshold by 2010. \n \n7. \nUnder  the  EPIRA's  directive,  PSALM  launched  its  first  attempt  to  appoint,  in  a \ncompetitive  bidding  process,  IPP  administrators  to  manage  NPC\u2019s  contracted  capacity.  The \nadministrators  will  make  a  monthly  payment  to  NPC  and  assume  NPC's  obligations  to  source \nfuel  and  manage  the  sale  of  the  power  from  the  IPPs,  including  bidding  on  the  WESM  and \nbilateral  contracting.  The  IPP  administrators  will  operate  independently  of  PSALM  to  minimize \nopportunities  for  collusion.  The  first  IPP  administrator  bid was  announced  in  October  2008  for \n\n                                                 \n2   State Grid of China owns 40% of NGCP and operates the national transmission system of the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC). Its transmission, distribution, and other assets cover 88% of the national territory and it is the PRC's \nsecond largest state-owned enterprise and the largest utility in the world. Its participation in NGCP is expected to \ngreatly improve the reliability and efficiency of the Philippines' grid. \n\n3   The ADB Board of Directors approved ADB's participation in the financing for the Calaca project in February 2008, \nbut no financing agreements were signed for this project. In July 2009, PSALM successfully re-bid the Calaca plant \nfor $362 million. The winning bidder is DMCI Holdings Inc. When turned over, NPC and PSALM will have privatized \n74% of its generation assets in Luzon and Visayas. \n\n4  PSALM successfully re-bid the Calaca plant for $362 million.

When \n\nturned over, NPC and PSALM will have privatized 74% of its generation assets in Luzon and Visayas. \n\n \n\n\f22     Appendix 2 \n\nthe power purchase agreement contracts attached to the 1,200 MW Sual and 700 MW Pagbilao \npower plants in Luzon; bids are due in May 2009. \n \n8. \nWholesale  Electricity  Spot  Market.  The  Philippine  Electricity  Market  Corporation \n(PEMC) launched the WESM in Luzon in June 2006 and functions as the market operator. The \nWESM is a mandatory gross-offer pool with net bilateral settlement and nodal marginal pricing. \nAll  generators  are  required  to  offer  into  the  market  but  may  settle  bilateral  contracts  that  are \nregistered  with  the  market  operator  directly  with  energy  buyers.  Spot  market  volume  in  2008 \nwas 4,927 gigawatt-hours (GWh) representing 14% on average of total volume in the system, \nand the cumulative average price was P4,770/megawatt-hour (MWh). Year to date, about 23% \nof  power  is  being  bought  on  the  WESM.  According  to  a  World  Bank-sponsored  study,5  some \ndysfunctional aspects of the WESM market rules could create distortions or inefficiencies in the \npricing  signals  for  investors.6  However,  many  industry  analysts  believe  the  WESM  has  been \ngenerally operating satisfactorily since its commercial launch.  \n \n9. \nThe study also drew several conclusions regarding the readiness of various participants \nfor the launch of WESM in the Visayas based on interviews and a review of the trial operations. \nIn summary, PEMC as the market operator is prepared, but NGCP as the system operator was \nconsidered understaffed and not fully prepared to operate in a market context. The generators \nhad  submitted  market  offers  and  tested  the  market  systems  but  were  not  fully  prepared  to \noperate in the market. The electric cooperatives were not ready to operate in a market context \nand many had not even registered and participated in trial operations. The study also predicted \nvery high prices should the WESM be launched in the current demand\u2013supply situation, which \ncould cause political problems.  \n \n10. \nThe  EPIRA  mandates  procurement  of  at  least  10%  from  the  market  for  distribution \nutilities for the first 5 years from the establishment of the WESM. In Luzon, PEMC targeted 45 \ndistribution  utilities  to  participate  in  the  WESM  but  only  14  are  now  members.  The  majority  of \ndistribution utilities fulfill the requirement through generators that buy power from the WESM on \ntheir  behalf.  WESM  participation  also  requires  a  prudential  deposit  in  cash  or  letter-of-credit \nbased on a distribution utility\u2019s net exposure to the WESM. PEMC is partnering with the National \nElectrification Administration (NEA) to offer capacity building programs to electric cooperatives \nto develop their proficiency to contract with power suppliers other than NPC and to participating \nin  the  spot  market.  NEA  will  also  offer  to  guarantee  the  purchase  of  electricity  by  the  electric \ncooperatives  to  help  them  meet  the  10%  requirement;  the  guarantee  will  be  conditioned  on \nparticipation in capacity building programs.  \n \n11. \nIn  December  2007,  PEMC  obtained  approval  to  launch  the  WESM  in  the  Visayas  in \n2008,  but  the  Department  of  Energy  overturned  this  decision  because  it  was  likely  to  result  in \nhigh WESM prices in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid due to tightened supply conditions. \nTo  stabilize  supply,  the  Department  of  Energy  directed  implementation  of  the  Visayas  Supply \nAugmentation Auction Program in January 2009, to be administered by PEMC and NGCP. The \n\n                                                 \n5  Intelligent Energy Systems. 2008. Technical Assistance on WESM Policy Development. Report to the DOE. Final \n\nReport: Extension of WESM to Visayas. Manila. \n\n6   For example, a significant number of trading intervals have spot prices at or below zero, implying that generators \nare bidding below their short-run marginal costs in order to get dispatched. This may be due to generators having \ntake-or-pay fuel contracts in addition to the market procedures on the management of generation minimum load. \nHowever, traders or generators may try to make up for zero prices by bidding very high prices during peak, which \nmakes WESM prices more volatile. Transmission constraints have also shown weaknesses in the WESM's pricing \ndetermination  methodology.  However,  ERC  recently  approved  a  method,  proposed  by  PEMC,  to  address  such \nsituations.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2     23 \n\nVisayas  Supply  Augmentation  Auction  Program  is  a  day-ahead  market  that  allows  (i)  entities \nthat have their own power supply (embedded generators) to use their own generators and sell \nthat  capacity  and  (ii)  grid-connected  customers  to  sell  an  interruptible  portion  of  their  loads \nthrough  an  auction  process.  This  is  a  form  of  demand  management  as  it  would  allow \nparticipants to manage their loads as well as to run their self-generation facilities, as means to \nease  the  supply  deficit  and  augment  supply  in  the  region.  PEMC  believes  that  the  Visayas \nSupply Augmentation Auction Program can add as much as 137 MW to supply the grid. \n \nRegulation  by  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC).  ERC's  functions  include  \n12. \n(i) developing and enforcing technical standards for transmission and distribution; (ii) licensing \nsuppliers  of  electricity,  including  generators  and  power  aggregators;  (iii)  preventing  abuse  of \nmarket  power  and  anticompetitive  or  discriminatory  behavior;  (iv)  resolving  disputes  between \nparticipants  in  the  sector;  and  (v)  setting  rates  for  noncontestable  sectors  of  the  industry.  At \npresent  the  noncontestable  sectors  are  transmission,  distribution,  and  generation.  Generation \nwill become contestable with the onset of open access and retail competition. ERC reviews and \napproves  the  terms  and  conditions  of  bilateral  contracts  between  generators  and  franchised \ndistribution  utilities.  Once  approved,  the  generation  rate  is  a  pass-through  by  the  distribution \nutility  to  its  customers.  ERC  approves  the  WESM\u2019s  pricing  methodologies  and  oversees  its \nimplementation by the market operator. \n \nERC is widely viewed by industry participants as having the intent to be transparent and \n13. \nnonpolitical, but lacking the human resources to conduct rulings efficiently and reasonably. To \naddress these concerns and move the reform program forward, ADB has provided a loan and \ntechnical  assistance7  to  the  Philippines  to  support  ERC\u2019s  ability  to,  among  others,  (i)  respond \nefficiently  and  fairly  to  market  issues,  and  (ii)  communicate  all  regulatory  matters  clearly  and \neffectively to the public and stakeholders.  \n \n14. \ncompetition and open access to distribution networks, subject to five conditions: \n \n\nOpen  Access.  Section  31  of  the  EPIRA  provides  for  the  establishment  of  retail \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nestablishment of the WESM, \napproval of unbundled transmission and distribution wheeling charges, \ninitial implementation of the cross-subsidy removal scheme, \nprivatization  of  at  least  70%  of  the  total  capacity  of  NPC  generating  assets  in \nLuzon and the Visayas, and \ntransfer of the management and control of at least 70% of the total energy output \nof power plants under contract with NPC to the IPP administrators. \n\n \n15. \nIn Resolution 3-2007, ERC set out the timeline for open access to distribution networks \nand  implementation  of  retail  competition.  According  to  the  resolution,  retail  competition  will \ncommence upon fulfillment of the five preconditions of the EPIRA\u2019s section 31 and of two other \n\u201cvital  requirements\u201d:  establishment  of  necessary  infrastructure  (such  as  a  customer  switching \nsystem)  and  promulgation  of  pertinent  regulations.  Once  all  of  these  conditions  are  met,  ERC \nwill  give  6  months  notice  before  open  access  and  retail  competition  commences  within  the \nLuzon grid; this will include the franchise areas of both private utilities and electric cooperatives. \nRetail competition will begin with end-users with an average peak demand of 1 MW.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2004.

Thereafter,  the \nthreshold  will  go  down  gradually  until  it  reaches  households  (within  7  years  following \ncommencement of the second phase of retail competition, a maximum of 9.5 years in total from \nthe original ERC notice). \n \n17. \nERC  cannot  set  a  definitive  timetable  due  to  uncertainty  from  PSALM  on  the  timing  of \nreaching  the  privatization  targets.  In  response  to  political  concerns  about  electricity  prices, \nindustrial  and  other  large  power  consumers  have  requested  that  implementation  of  retail \ncompetition and open access be accelerated within the framework of the EPIRA. A number of \nindustry  participants,  comprising  IPPs  and  investor-owned  distribution  companies,  petitioned \nERC to make an order to allow interim open access to come into effect for large power users. \nThese  applicants  argued  that  although  EPIRA  preconditions  have  not  yet  been  met,  making \nsuch an order would be consistent with the EPIRA\u2019s policy intent. On the other hand, others are \nconcerned that interim access may negate the will of the Government to follow through with its \nprivatization targets and hence continue to have undue influence on the market. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3     25 \n\nRATIONALE FOR ADOPTION OF FUEL TYPE AND TECHNOLOGY \n\njointly \n\nthat  resulted \n\nto  support  a \n\n(SPC)  worked \n\nfeasibility  study \n\nConsiderations for Location \n\n \n1. \nIn June 2004, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea \nand  the  Department  of  Energy  of  the  Philippines  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \nfoster cooperation between the two countries in addressing the projected power supply shortage \nin  Cebu,  and  to  promote  utilization  of  technology  for  more  environment-friendly  power \ngeneration. Later that year, the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and the SPC Power \nCorporation \nin  a \nrecommendation  to  construct  a  200-megawatt  (MW)  coal-fired  power  plant  on  the  island  of \nCebu,  utilizing  circulating  fluidized  bed  (CFB)  combustion  technology,  in  an  area  adjacent  to \nSPC's  Naga  Power  Plant  Complex  (the  Project).  In  determining  the  optimal  location  and  fuel \nsupply  for  the  Project,  the  study  took  into  account  the  unique  configuration  of  the  Visaya's \ntransmission  grid  and  the  availability  of  other  fuel  sources,  including  indigenous  renewable \nresources  such  as  geothermal.  After  determining  coal  to  be  the  optimal  fuel  type,  the  study \nconsidered subcritical CFB technology to be the most effective from the viewpoint of the plant's \nsize, coal characteristics, environmental regulation, and cost. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Philippines  is  the  world's  second  largest  user  of  geothermal  energy  for  power \ngeneration  with  1,958  MW  accounting  for  12%  of  the  country's  total  installed  capacity.  The \ncontinued development of geothermal energy as an economically competitive and environment-\nfriendly resource remains a Government priority. Almost 50% of the Philippines total geothermal \ncapacity is located in the Visayas (723 MW in Leyte and 242 MW in Negros). Total geothermal \npotential  in  the  Visayas  is  estimated  at  1,619  MW  constituting  42%  of  the  country's  total \ngeothermal  reserves.  However,  existing  geothermal  plants  are  only  operating  at  a  fraction  of \ntheir  rated  capacities1  and  new  geothermal  capacity  is  expected  to  come  on-line  very  slowly \nrelative  to  demand  growth.  Even  accounting  for  the  new  geothermal  capacity  expected,  the \nDepartment of Energy has identified a need for additional base-load generation in Cebu.2 \n \n3. \nHistorically  the  majority  of  electric  power  produced  by  geothermal  plants  in  Leyte  was \nsupplied  to  the  Luzon  Grid  as  the  demand  for  power  in  the  Visayas  was  less  than  the \ngeothermal  power  generation  available.  However,  as  energy  demand  grew  in  the  Visayas  in \nrecent years, the situation has reversed. The Visayas may become a net importer this year as \nthe demand\u2013supply balance reaches critical levels and additional capacity (and refurbishments) \nare brought on-line in Luzon. \n \n4. \nFigure A3 shows the flow of power through the grid at 19:00 hours on 24 March 2009, \none of the highest peak hours for demand this year. Demand on the grid was 1,166 MW, while \ntotal  available  capacity  was  1,222  MW.  To  make  up  for  demand  and  line  losses,  27  MW  of \npower had to be imported from Luzon. Cebu represents 45% of total Visayas demand, but only \n25% of the total capacity. Cebu had the highest power deficit (214 MW). Panay and Bohol face \nthe  most  potential  line  losses  due  to  their  position  at  the  end  of  the  grid.  The  figure  also \n\n                                                 \n1   Geothermal plants have not been operating at full capacity due to instability and declines in steam supply and other \n\ntechnical constraints such as mineral blockage of wells. \n\n2   This  outcome  was  confirmed  in  the  model  constructed  by  the  lenders'  market  consultant  for  project  supply  and \ndemand.  The  model  assumes  the  following  additions  to  geothermal  capacity:  PNOC-EDC's  20  MW  Nasulo \nGeothermal Project in Negros in 2010, 40 MW Dauin Geothermal Project in Negros in 2012, and 100 MW Cabalian \nGeothermal  Project  in  Leyte  in  2015.  The  model  also  assumes  additional  wells  are  drilled  to  offset  the  natural \ndecline  in  performance  of  existing  wells,  so  the  capacity  factor  of  geothermal  plants  remains  at  60%\u201380%.  Even \nso, the model shows that coal projects are a necessary supplement to provide adequate supply.   \n\n \n\n\f26     Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nFigure A3: Visayas Interconnection Power Flow, MW at 1900H March 24, 2009 \n\nhighlights the vulnerability of the grid, particularly in the Cebu-Negros-Panay region, since none \nof the interconnections are managed on an N-1 basis.3 If a submarine cable goes down or its \ncapacity is reduced, or if a large power station is on outage up the supply chain, it could easily \ndisrupt power in all three islands. For this reason, the Department of Energy advocates building \nmore  capacity  in  Cebu,  Negros,  and  Panay  to  enhance  each  island's  energy  security.  Adding \nplants on Cebu Island in particular will help increase reliability of power to the region's largest \nload center (metro Cebu City), as well as to Negros and Panay. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdding  capacity  to  submarine  interconnectors  in  the  Visayas  grid  is  not  viewed  as  an \n5. \noptimal or efficient solution to the power crisis in this region. Submarine cables are very costly, \nand most of the geothermal capacity on Leyte and Samar is already being evacuated through \nexisting interconnectors or consumed locally. Relying on such a solution also involves technical \nissues  such  as  high  line  losses  and  difficulties  in  regulating  voltage  over  long  distances.  The \ntechnical vulnerability of the grid would remain high. Management personnel from the National \nGrid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) warn against \"applying a transmission solution to a \ngeneration problem.\"  \n \n6. \nNonetheless,  NGCP  has  a  number  of  projects  under  way  to  upgrade  the  submarine \ncables  interconnecting  the  Visayas  islands.  Ongoing  is  the  Negros\u2013Panay  Interconnection \nuprating to add another 100 MW to the existing 100 MW capacity (peak limit 76\u201385 MW), which \nwill  optimize  the  utilization  of  indigenous  power  coming  from  geothermal  capacity  additions  in \n\nSource: National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   The N\u20131 rule states that during the outage of any single transmission element of the power system, the following \nconditions  must  be  simultaneously  met:  (i)  no  transmission  elements  are  overloaded,  (ii)  bus  voltages  are  within \nallowable  limits,  (iii)  the  remaining  generators  stay  in  synchronism  after  a  disturbance,  and  (iv)  no  service  to \ncustomers is interrupted. To meet N-1 compliance, the dispatch of power flows on the transmission path between \nLeyte and the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid would be limited to 220 MW, versus 360 MW under the current \napproach.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3     27 \n\nRationale for Fuel Type \n\n \nB. \n \n7. \nGiven  the  security  constraints  in  the  Cebu,  Negros,  and  Panay  grid,  more  expensive \ndiesel plants are currently being dispatched on a \"must run\" basis (or more similar to base-load \nplants),  which  is  polluting,  costly,  and  inefficient.4  Thus,  the  next  capacity  addition  that  makes \nmost sense for each island in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay grid is a new base-load plant. For \nNegros,  base-load  capacity  could  be  supplied  from  geothermal  sources.  For  Cebu  and  Panay \nhowever,  the  most  sensible  fuel  supply  for  a  base-load  plant  is  coal.  Table  A3  illustrates  a \ncomparative analysis of potential alternative fuel types. A coal-fired power plant in Cebu would \ntake  second  priority  in  dispatch  after  available  geothermal  capacity  via  interconnection, \ndisplacing existing diesel plants that will operate as peaking plants as designed.  \n \n\nTable A3: Comparative Analysis of Alternative Fuel Types for a Power Plant in Cebu \n \nFuel Locally \nAvailable \nNo \n\nCapacity \u2265 \n150 MW \nYes \n\nBase \nPlant \nYes \n\nRemarks \n\nPlant \n\nNuclear \n\nHydro \n\nBiomass \nGeothermala \nSolar or Wind \n\nNatural Gasb \n\nOil \n\nCoal \n\nNo \n\nNo \nYes \nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \nYes \nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nYes \nNo \nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nNot recommended due to public fear of \nnuclear accidents \nNot recommended due to lack of \nadequate water sources \nLimited fuel supply \nNo local geothermal fields in Cebu \nLimited solar and wind power resources \nand large area needed.

Relatively \nexpensive. \nNot recommended because fuel is not \navailable \nFuel is available locally and imported. \nCleaner technology is available. \n\na Geothermal  is not expected to be a  large  contributor to  additional  power supply in the near future  because of the \nhigh risk, long lead times, and high capital costs related to exploration (finding steam and locating reliable wells). \nExisting geothermal projects on Leyte and Negros are not performing as expected. \n\nb  The  Malampaya  gas  field  has  sufficient  capacity  to  support  another  300\u2013500  MW  power  station.  However, \ncombined-cycle  gas  turbine  plants  in  the  Visayas  are  unlikely  to  achieve  a  sufficient  capacity  factor  to  meet  the \ntake-or-pay obligations required to justify a liquified natural gas terminal \n\nSource: Korea Electric Power Corporation and SPC Power Corporation. \n \n8. \nThe optimum capacity for a new plant was determined as part of the feasibility study in \nNovember 2004. The study concluded that 200 MW was the optimal base-load capacity due to \nthe  size  and  projected  demand  of  the  Visayas  grid.  For  a  plant  this  size,  the  capacity  factor \nwould be more than 75% from the first year of operation, and more than 80% from the next year \non. Capacity factors above 75% represent an efficient and cost-effective operation for a base-\nload plant. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   The  short-run  marginal  cost  in  2008  for  a  diesel  plant  is  estimated  to  be  P5,022\u2013P9,868  per  megawatt-hour, \n\ncompared to P1,400 for CFB coal, P3,000 for pulverized coal, and P1,120 for geothermal.  \n\n \n\n\f28     Appendix 3 \n\nRationale for CFB Technology \n\nC. \n \n9. \nOf  the  35  plants  in  the  Visayas,  only  5  are  100  MW  or  more.  The  largest  single \ngenerating unit is 77.5 MW. In terms of unit size, the feasibility study recommends 100 MW after \ntaking  into  consideration  the  grid  operating  conditions,  projected  demand  increases,  and \neconomic  considerations.  The  small  size  of  the  Visayas  grid 5   and  the  dependency  of  the \ntransmission  system  on  submarine  cables  with  limited  capacity  mean  that  the  ramp-up  or \noutage of units much larger than 100 MW could have a highly disruptive impact on the physical \npower system, as well as on the market for power.  \n \n10. \nThe  advantages  of  applying  supercritical  (or  once-through)  technology  to  coal-fired \npower plants include reduced fuel costs due to higher efficiencies6 and lower carbon emissions. \nHowever, supercritical technology is typically adopted only in large power plants where the unit \ncapacity is around 500 MW or higher.7 It is not cost-effective for small power plants to apply this \nkind  of  technology  because  it  requires  more  capital  to  build  boilers  with  the  high-quality  steel \nnecessary to withstand high temperatures. Furthermore, efficiencies gained from a small boiler \nusing supercritical technology is not significantly different from one using subcritical technology. \nFor these reasons, no boilers below 400\u2013500 MW using supercritical technology are available in \nthe  market.  The  Project  is  therefore  utilizing  subcritical  technology,  with  a  combustion  system \nthat involves CFB firing as opposed to pulverized coal firing. \n \n11. \nCFB combustion technology enables the plant to use a wider variety of coal and reduce \nsulfur  dioxide  and  nitrous  oxides  emissions.  These  are  more  observable  pollutants  that  have \nmore of a direct health impact on neighboring communities. CFB evolved from efforts to find a \ncombustion process able to control pollutant emissions without external emission controls (such \nas  scrubbers).  Desulfurization  takes  place  within  the  process  itself  by  using  limestone  to \nprecipitate out sulfate during combustion. This reduces the amount of sulfur emitted in the form \nof  sulfur  dioxide  emissions.  Since  the  technology  also  allows  coal  plants  to  burn  at  cooler \ntemperatures, nitrous oxides emissions are reduced and no additional equipment or process is \nrequired to remove them. \n \n12. \nIntegrating  the  two  concepts  of  supercritical  and  CFB  has  not  been  a  high  priority  for \nmanufacturers  because  the  added  efficiency  of  once-through  technology  does  not  result  in \nsignificant  fuel  savings  since  the  fuel  is  typically  low  in  cost  for  CFB  combustion  boilers. \nGlobally, no efforts are being made to adopt supercritical technology for CFB-type power plants \nwith 100 MW unit capacity. \n\n                                                \n \n5   System peak for the region is about 1,200 MW and 600 MW for Cebu island.  \n6   Supercritical  turbines  envision  running  a  boiler  at  extremely  high  temperatures  and  pressures  with  projected \n\nefficiencies as high as 46%. \n\n7   The  cost  per  MW  decreases  with  increased  plant  size.  Recent  plants  built  in  Europe  and  Asia  use  supercritical \nboiler-turbine  technology  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  has  made  this  standard  for  all  new  plants  600  MW \nand larger. \n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 4     29 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS DUE DILIGENCE REPORT \n \n\nEnvironmental Due Diligence \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe Visayas Base-Load Power Project (the Project) is classified as category A following \nthe  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  environmental \nimpacts of the Project were assessed and the Government approved the environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  on  5  December  2005.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n(SEIA) was prepared and, in accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), was \ndisclosed to the public through ADB website on 10 March 2009. This appendix updates some \naspects of the SEIA based on the ongoing development of the Project and improvements based \non measures to comply further with ADB safeguards policies. \n \nA mission1 visited the project site to assess the environment and social activities, and to \n2. \naddress any remaining environmental issues anticipated during project operation. The mission \nmet with project management and staff who provided briefings and key project documents. The \nmission  toured  the  project  construction  areas,  proposed  pier  expansion,  discharge  canal  and \nash  pond  disposal  sites,  and  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant  Complex  of  SPC  Power \nCorporation (SPC). The mission also met with local residents to obtain their views and concerns \nabout the Project.  \n \n\n1. \n\nMission Findings and Observations  \n\nCompliance with Philippine Environmental Regulations. The Project is subject to the \n3. \nGovernment\u2019s  Presidential  Decree  1586,  Establishing  the  Philippine  Environmental  Impact \nSystem  and  its  implementing  rules  and  regulations.  The  rules  and  regulations  identify  the \nprescribed  projects  and  approval  process  requiring  EIA.  Based  on  the  EIA  report  (2005) \nprepared by Test Consultants Inc., the Department of Environment Natural Resources (DENR) \ngranted  environmental  approval  for  the  Project  on  5  December  2005.  Based  on  the \nenvironmental assessment report for the 138-kilovolt double circuit on steel towers (kV DC/ST) \ntransmission  line  from  KEPCO  (Korea  Electric  Power  Corporation)  Power  Plant  New  Naga \n(Cebu)  SS  prepared  by  the  National  Transmission  Corporation,  Environmental  Management \nBureau  Region  7,  the  Department  of  Environment  Natural  Resources  granted  environmental \napproval  in  20  February  2009.  Other  environmental  laws  applicable  to  the  Project  include  (i) \nRepublic  Act  6969,  Toxic  Substances,  Hazardous  and  Nuclear  Wastes  Control  Act  of  1990; \nRepublic  Act  8749,  The  Clean  Air  Act;  (iii)  Republic  Act  9275,  The  Clean  Water  Act;  and  (iv) \nPresidential Decree 984, The National Pollution Control Decree of 1976. \n \n4. \nPlant Location and Ecologically Sensitive Areas. The Project is located 22 kilometers \n(km)  south-southwest  of  Cebu  City,  the  premier  urban  center  in  the  province  of  Cebu.  The \nproject  area  comprises  mainly  mountain  ranges  on  the  western  side  and  Bohol  Strait  on  the \neastern  side.  It  is  drained  by  two  rivers:  the  Colon  and  Pandan.  Colon  River  is  smaller,  with \nheadwaters west of the project site. It flows from northwest to southeast and exits to Bohol Strait \nabout  0.5  km  from  the  project  site.  Further  west  and  south  is  Pandan  River,  which  flows  from \nnorth to south and then west\u2013northwest to east\u2013southeast to Bohol Strait about 1.5 km south of \n\n                                                 \n1  An ADB mission visited the Visayas Base-Load Project site in March and April 2009. The mission in March 2009 \ncomprised  Shih-liang  Tu,  senior  environment  specialist,  and  Arlene  Porras,  environmental  and  social  safeguards \nconsultant.  The  follow-up  mission  in  April  comprised  Marinela  Cecilia  T.  Pascua,  environment  officer  and  Arlene \nPorras. \n\n  \n\n\f30     Appendix 4 \n\nNaga. The project site is not located or adjacent to any area of cultural or ecological significance \nsuch as cultural heritage site, national park, protected area, wildlife sanctuary, or special area \nfor protecting biodiversity. \n \nAirshed.  The ambient air quality monitoring in Naga area from July 2007 to June 2008 \n5. \nindicates  that  total  suspended  particulate  matter  is  within  national  standards.  However,  the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines are exceeded significantly.2 Ambient air \nquality  monitoring  by  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant  shows  levels  within  national  and  WHO \nguidelines  except  for  the  second  quarter  when  particulate  matter  was  significantly  beyond  the \nlimits. However, the data from the Naga Power Plant area are unreliable as requirements, such \nas duration of sampling and frequency, are not adequately met during the monitoring to base a \nclassification.  The  decommissioning  of  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant  is  not  imminent. \nTherefore, the Project will need to ensure that any increase in air pollution will be minimal and \nwill amount to a fraction of applicable national guidelines.  \n \n6. \nEnvironment  Management  Plan.  The  environment  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the \nProject was formulated as part of the project EIA and comprises a set of measures to mitigate \npotential impacts that may occur during all phases of project implementation. Its main objective \nis  to  minimize  the  direct  and  indirect  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  through \nsound  planning  and  introduction  of  proper  construction  and  monitoring  techniques  during \nconstruction and operation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDuring Construction \n\nAir  Quality  and  Noise.  The  mission  found  that  based  on  the  Project's  EMP  during \n7. \nconstruction,  ambient  and  source-specific  air  quality  monitoring  is  conducted  for  total \nsuspended  particulate,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,  and  noise  using \nmethods  of  sampling  and  analyses  based  on  United  States  Environment  Protection  Agency \nMethods and Philippine standards for Air and Water. Recent construction monitoring data show \nthe levels are within the maximum national and World Bank environmental, health, and safety \n(EHS) guidelines (Table A4.1). \n \nWater Quality. The Project is following the mitigation measures to reduce the impact of \n8. \nconstruction  on  water  quality,  as  outlined  in  the  SEIA,  including  (i)  proper  management, \nhandling, and disposal of spoils and unsuitable materials to prevent siltation and sedimentation \nof nearby water bodies; (ii) construction of bund walls of adequate capacity around fuel, oil, and \nsolvent storage tanks to minimize the risk of contamination of nearby receiving bodies of water; \nand (iii) establishment of oil and grease traps in drainage systems (from workshops, vehicle and \nplant washing facilities, and service and fuelling areas). Based on the EMP during construction, \nsurface water quality monitoring is in place with parameters measured using standard methods \nfor  examination  of  water  and  wastewater.  Recent  construction  monitoring  data  of  the  marine \nwaters  off  Bohol  Strait  indicate  levels  generally  below  national  limits  except  for  dissolved \noxygen, which is above limits (Table A4.2). \n \nCoastal  Erosion  and  Sedimentation.  Coastal  sedimentation  may  bury  the  natural \n9. \ncoastline and affect marine biota. Runoff velocities will be kept low through the development of \nmilder  slopes  or  breaking  the  slope,  to  decrease  the  erosive  force  of  water.  The  mission \n\n                                                 \n2   Per  World  Bank  and  International  Finance  Corporation  EHS  guidelines,  an  air  shed  should  be  considered  as \nhaving poor air quality if national air quality standards or WHO air quality guidelines are exceeded significantly. \n\n \n\n\fobserved that slope stabilization measures such as riprap works are established along sections \nof the coastal area of the construction site. \n \n\nTable A4.1: Summary of Air Quality and Noise Monitoring Data, Fourth Quarter 2008 \n \n\nAppendix 4     31 \n\nParameter \n\nRange \n\nTotal Suspended Particulates, \nAmbient \nTotal Suspended Particulates, \nConstruction Site \nSulfur Dioxide \nNitrogen Dioxide \nCarbon Monoxide \n  \nNoise, Ambient \nNoise, Construction Site \n\n \n\n<1\u2013260.8 \u00b5g/Ncm \n\n<1\u201376.3 \u00b5g/Ncm \n\n<7 \u00b5g/Ncm \n<1\u201320.84 \u00b5g/Ncm \n0 ppm \n\n \n\n41.0\u201358.0 dBA \n52.0\u201369.3 dBA \n\nPhilippine \nStandardsa \n\n230 \n\n230 \n\n180 \n150 \n30 ppm \n\nIndustrial \n65\u201375 dBA \n \nResidential \n43\u201355 \n\nWHO/World \nBank/IFC \nStandardsb \n25\u201375c \n\n25\u201375c \n\n20\u2013125c \n20\u2013125c \nNone \n\nIndustrial \n70 dBA \n \nResidential \n45\u201355 dBA  \n\ndBA = decibels; \u00b5g/Ncm = microgram per normal cubic meter, IFC = International Finance Corporation.  \na Based on the Philippine Clean Air Act 1999 or Republic Act 8749 \nb World Health Organization Ambient Air Quality Guidelines in World Bank and International Finance Corporation, \n\n2007.

On  10  November  2009,  KSPC  and  the  Cebu  Provincial  Government \n14. \n(CPG)  entered  into  an  Ash  Disposal  Agreement  and  MOU  for  Ash  Recycling,  whereby  CPG \nprovides the ash generated by the Project to one or more cement manufacturers. KSPC (or its \ntransportation  contractor)  will  deliver  the  ash  to  the  cement  manufacturer  on  behalf  of  CPG. \nRecycling  of  ash  for  use  as  a  raw  material  in  cement  manufacturing  is  considered  an \nenvironmentally  acceptable  practice  globally.  In  emergencies,  ash  will  be  transferred  from  the \nsilo in a humidified form and stored in the emergency ash pond on-site, lined with high density \npolyethylene (HDPE) to ensure no ground seepage of the wet ash. In the event that alternative \nash  disposal  is  needed,   KSPC  and  CPG  agree  that  KSPC  will  not  deliver,  and  CPG  will  not \nallow any ash disposal  to any site other than to the cement manufacturer, until any proposed \nsite meets ADB's environmental and social safeguards requirements and approval.   \n \n \n \n15. \nEnvironment,  Health,  and  Safety  Arrangements  and  Procedures.  The  EPC \ncontractor  Doosan  has  established  its  environmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  management \ncertified as ISO 14001 and OSHAS 18001 compliant. An EHS active program for the Project is \nin  place  and  implemented  by  an  EHS  team  at  the  project  site.  The  program's  EHS  policies \ninclude  (i)  promoting  control  of  the  residual  impact  of  atmospheric  emissions,  ground  or  sea \nwater,  and  wastes  in  all  construction  activities  to  preserve  the  natural  environment;  \n(ii) promoting health and protection of human beings by identifying, controlling, and monitoring \nrisk;  adapting  safety  processes;  and  being  prepared  for  emergencies;  and  (iii)  promoting  the \napplication  of  the  rules  of  safety  and  protection  of  workers  and  equipment,  and  considering \nthese  rules  to  be  applied  to  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  EHS  team  responsibilities  include  \n(i)  issue  and  promote  the  EHS  active  program,  (ii)  manage  the  EHS  index,  (iii)  provide  risk \ncontrol  management,  (iv)  inspect  workers  and  equipment,  (v)  provide  EHS  education  and \ninduction, (v) issue EHS contracts, (vi) manage site security, (vii) monitor physical examination \nresults, (viii) manage first aid and site emergency control, (ix) manage environmental monitoring \nand  control,  and  (x)  liaise  with  local  government  regarding  EHS  concerns.  No  accidents  have \nbeen recorded.  \n \n16. \nKSPC  will  establish  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS),  to  be  led  and \nmonitored  by  its  environmental  department,  with  three  staff  and  one  manager  during  project \noperation.  The  Project  will  comply  with  all  relevant  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding \nenvironmental protection.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Safeguard Due Diligence \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\nKEPCO Power Plant \n\na. \n \n\n17. \nKSPC  acquired  the  land  for  the  coal-fired  power  plant  (visited  by  the  mission)  through \nopen and competitive bidding conducted by NPC and PSALM on 14 November 2005. KSPC will \nlease the land for 25 years; its only use will be for the new power plant. The Naga land has an \napproximate area of 119,406 square meters (m2). Of this only 84,359 m2 will be occupied by the \nproposed  power  plant  project.  This  parcel  of  land  is  registered  in  the  name  of  NPC  under \nOriginal Certificate of Title No. OP-58961. \n \n18. \nThe  land  used  to  be  occupied  by  22  nontitled  and/or  informal  settler  families.  KSPC, \nNPC, and Naga City, Cebu, signed a memorandum of agreement for the necessary negotiations \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 4 \n\nwith  the  affected  nontitled  and/or  informal  settler  families  and  secured  the  relocation  site  just \noutside  the  leased  land.  Of  the  22  affected  families,  17  have  voluntarily  evacuated  and \nrelocated. The local government unit (LGU) provided the affected families with a plot of land in \nthe  relocation  site.  KSPC  provided  financial  assistance  and  the  required  labor  force  for \nconstruction  of  their  new  houses.  KSPC  assisted  with  demolition  of  the  existing  structures \nthrough  its  contractor,  and  owners  were  allowed  to  keep  salvageable  materials  for  use  to \nreconstruct  their  new  houses.  Each  family  was  provided  with  a  lot  of  30  m2  for  the  dwelling \nstructure.  The  relocation  activities  started  on  15  October  2008  and  were  completed  after  \n1  month.  The  remaining  five  families,  who  claimed  to  have  legal  titles  and  have  partially \nencroached on the leased land, have filed a case in court. While awaiting the court resolution, \nthe encroached areas have been fenced off and the families remain unaffected. \n \nThe relocation site is publicly owned land. At the time of the mission, no certificates of \n19. \naward had been granted to the relocated families. The barangay officials in close coordination \nwith the Office of the Mayor had initiated the process of preparing the necessary certificates of \naward, which have legal standing and represent protection for relocated families against eviction \nor repossession of home lots. KSPC will assist the municipality in accessing funds provided by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code and Energy Regulations No. 1-94 of Department of \nEnergy. \n \nThe  mission  visited  the  resettlement  site  to  assess  the  condition  of  housing  and \n20. \ninfrastructure, and community living standards. The mission found that the new houses are well \nconstructed and located in an elevated area with access to fresh sea breeze and away from the \nash  pond  of  the  old  plant,  where  they  used  to experience  a  bad  dust smell.  The mission  held \ndiscussions with the barangay officials and local residents. The mission also inspected the new \naccess  road  going  to  the  resettlement  site  and  the  water  supply  system  for  the  relocated \nfamilies.  It  was  noted  that  KSPC  had  played  a  significant  role  not  only  in  financing  physical \nimprovements to the area, but also supporting community programs and emergency assistance. \nAside from physical improvements and moving allowance, a new access road (gravel type only), \npower, and water supply (i.e., shallow wells) have been provided to the relocated people. More \ninformation  is  available  from  KSPC's  Social  Development  Plan  and  Corporate  Social \nResponsibility Program. \n \n21. \nNo outstanding grievances are related to compensation for structures owned by informal \nsettlers. Relocated families said in interviews that they are satisfied with their present situation \nbecause the relocation site is very accessible to their work place, and basic utilities (power and \nwater) are provided. A respondent said that the financial package of P15,000 per family is not \nenough  to  rebuild  their  house  and  the  allocated  lot  of  30  m2 is  too  small,  as  their  previous  lot \nwas at least 50 m2. An LGU official mentioned that subdivision of the available resettlement area \nwas  calculated  at  30  m2  per  relocate  to  accommodate  all  17  families.  The  Office  of  the \nBarangay  Captain  serves  as  the  channel  to  accept  and  address  complaints,  requests,  and \ngrievances from local residents. The Social Development Plan also applies to relocated families. \n \n\nb. \n\n138  KV  DC-ST  Transmission  Line  from  KEPCO  Power  Plant  to  New \nNaga (Cebu) Substation \n\n \nThe  National  Grid  Corporation  of  the  Philippines 3   project  related  to  the  KSPC  plant \n22. \nincludes  the  following  components:  (i)  substation  area;  (ii)  access  road;  and  (iii)  right-of-way \n\n                                                 \n3   The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines has been awarded the 25-year concession contract to manage the \n\ncountry's power grid and in January 2009 took over these operations from National Transmission Corporation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4     35 \n\n(ROW) corridors of the transmission line components, including the KSPC project transmission \nline. The project transmission line will cover only the installation of the 0.70 km long line (138 kV \nDC/ST,  6-795  MCM  ACSR/AS  \u201cCondor\u201d)  from  the  KSPC  power  plant  to  the  new  Naga \nsubstation.  Approximately  half  of  its  length  will  pass  inside  the  SPC  Power  Complex.  A  30-\nmeter-wide ROW corridor passing through flat and rolling lands, will affect about 10 houses and \n9  secondary  structures,  most  of  which  are  located  beside  a  barangay  road  that  the  line  will \ntraverse.  Table  A4.4  presents  the  summary  of  project-affected  people,  structures,  and \nproperties. \n \n\nTable A4.4: Impact Figures \n \n\nDescription \nEstimated Area of Affected Private Landa \nEstimated Area of Affected Land inside Salcon Power \nComplex \nEstimated No. of Affected Houses \nEstimated No. of Affected Structures \nEstimated Number of Project Affected People \n\nLandowner \nTenant \nStructure Owner \n\nm2 = square meter \nSource: KEPCO SPC Power Corporation, July 2009. \n\nImpact Figures \n\n6,327 m2 \n9,467 m2 \n\n10 \n9 \n \n5 \n4 \n13 \n\n \n23. \nUse of the ROW easement of the transmission lines, including the land required for steel \ntowers  to  be  erected  inside  the  Salcon  Power  Plant  Complex,  is  covered  by  the  Naga  co-use \nagreement executed by NPC, PSALM, and KSPC on 25 June 2008. For ROW passing through \nprivate lands, landowners will be paid at current fair market value. The initial standard rate used \nto calculate compensation was P389.00 per m2. After negotiations with affected people and to \nreflect the latest Schedule of Unit Base Market Value for Residential, Commercial and Industrial \nLands for the Municipality of Naga in Cebu, the rate was increased to P813 per m2. While the \nland use is residential, TransCo adopted the valuation for industrial lands. \n \nA short resettlement plan for the project transmission line was extracted from the main \n24. \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  Affected  households  will  be  granted  disturbance \ncompensation  and  the  option  to  self-relocate  to  their  chosen  or  preferred  place  of  residence. \nThey  can  opt  to  transfer  in  the  same  vicinity  as  long  as  they  move  their  structure  30  meters \naway from the right-of-way limit, i.e., 15 m from the left and 15 m from the right. Together with \nthe  tenants,  landowners  will  be  compensated  for  affected  crops,  plants,  and  trees.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement cost for the KEPCO line is estimated at P7 million.  \n \nPrior to actual implementation of the Project, National Grid Corporation of the Philippines \n25. \n(NGCP)  undertook  consultation,  dialogue,  and  information  campaigns  with  project-affected \npeople, LGUs, and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed about the important aspects \nof  the  Project.  After  all  consultations  and  dialogue,  an  official  endorsement  from  the  affected \nLGUs  (Colon  barangay  and  Naga  City),  and  development  councils  was  secured  as  proof  of \nsocial acceptance of the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f36     Appendix 4 \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Engagement \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\nEnvironment.  The  mission  confirms \n\nNo indigenous people live in Naga City. The majority of household populations classify \n26. \nthemselves  as  Cebuano.  No  indigenous  people  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  Therefore  no \nissues are resulting from the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n \n \nAs  part  of  its  commitment  to  meet  the  conditions  of  the  environmental  compliance \n27. \ncertificate,  KSPC  will  implement  and  undertake  a  social  development  plan  (SDP)  and  various \ncorporate  social  responsibility  (CSR) 4   projects  and  activities.  The  SPD  and  CSR  activities \nbegan upon commencement of construction activities and will continue throughout commercial \nproduction of the KSPC power plant. \n \n28. \nThe  SDP  will  include  activities  and  programs  to  benefit  not  only  the  barangay  directly \naffected by the Project but the entire host community. The SDP incorporated with the CSR will \nhave  an  annual  budget  of  P240,000.00  with  projects  and  activities  that  involve  health, \nsanitation,  nutrition,  and  education.  No  specific  budget  per  year  is  allocated  for  relocated \nfamilies but the SDP is applicable for all local residents in Colon barangay. \n \nC.  \n \n29. \nthat  ADB's  environmental  assessment \nrequirements as well as national and local requirements related to environmental impacts of the \nProject have been adequately met. Environment, health, and safety management and plans are \nin  place  with  responsibilities  of  addressing  environmental  impacts  and  implementation  of \nmitigating  measures  during  construction  by  Doosan.  Site  visit  and  construction  monitoring \nresults indicate that the ongoing construction of the Project has no significant adverse impact on \nthe  environment.  Follow-up  environmental  management  studies  and  plans  are  now  being \nundertaken  to  provide  for  more  detailed  planning.  Implementation  of  the  Project's  EMP  during \noperation  will  ensure  that  any  adverse  or  significant  impacts  will  be  adequately  addressed. \nApplicable national and World Bank environmental standards are and will be strictly monitored \nand adhered to. \n \n30. \nInvoluntary Resettlement. For land acquisition and resettlement issues, the Mission did \nnot  find  any  outstanding  issues  with  the  compensation  and  assistance  provided  to  nontitled \nfamilies  relocated  from  the  Project  site.  For  the  project  transmission  line,  a  short  resettlement \nplan was prepared, which the mission found satisfactory. Moreover, KSPC will continue to assist \naffected families and contribute to the local community through its SDP and the CSR program.  \n \nIndigenous  Peoples.  With respect to the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \n31. \nPeoples, the mission found that the Project will not affect any indigenous peoples. Hence, the \nProject is categorized as C. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n                                                \n4   In compliance with condition 6 provided upon the issuance of Board of Investment certificate of registration, which \n\nstates that the company will undertake various CSR projects and activities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n    Appendix 5     37 \n\nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR THE PROJECT TRANSMISSION LINE \n\n \nA. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n1. \nThe proposed 138 kV DC-ST transmission line from the KEPCO SPC Power Corporation \n(KSPC) Power Plant to the New Naga (Cebu) Substation (the project transmission line) aims to \nprovide  a  new  termination  point  that  can  accommodate  future  load  growth  and  maintain  an \nelectricity highway characterized as a reliable, secure, stable, and resilient power system. It will \nestablish  the  asset  boundary  between  the  National  Transmission  Company  (TransCo)  asset \nboundary  and  power  plant  by  separating  control  of  Salcon  Power  Plant  Complex  from \nTransCo\u2019s  substation.  The  proposed  substation  will  serve  as  the  receiving  station  of  the \nproposed  KSPC  200  megawatt  (MW)  Coal-Fired  Power  Plant.  The  old  Naga  (Salcon) \nswitchyard  is  already  congested,  and  all  the  installed  protection  equipment  and  materials  are \nunderrated and operating beyond their economic life. \n \nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n\n2. \nA social analysis carried out in the project area concludes that the Project would require \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  transmission  line  will  cover  the  installation  of  a \n0.70  kilometer  (km)  long  transmission  line  (138  kV  DC/ST)  from  the  KSPC  power  plant  to  the \nNew  Naga  Substation.  For  expediency,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  for  the \nproject  transmission  line  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nplan  (September  2008)  prepared  by  TransCo,  which  will  be  implemented  by  National  Grid \nCorporation of the Philippines (NGCP)36 as part of the New Naga Substation Project. In addition \nto  the  project  transmission  line,  the  NGCP  New  Naga  Substation  Project  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan (LARP) also covers the following components, which are not being proposed \nfor  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing:  (i)  expansion  of  the  existing  New  Naga \nSubstation, (ii) construction of the Banilad\u2013Quiot\u2013New Naga 138 kV cut-in-line, (iii) Suba L1 and \nL2 138 kV line extension, (iv) Sigpit and Suba L3 138 kV line extension, and (v) New Naga 69 \nkV line extension.  \n \n3. \nApproximately  half  of  the  length  of  the  project  transmission  line  will  pass  inside  the \nSalcon Power Complex (i.e., existing Naga Power Plant). A 30-meter wide right-of-way (ROW) \ncorridor  will  pass  through  flat  to  rolling  lands,  and  affect  about  10  houses  and  9  secondary \nstructures, most of which are located beside a barangay road that the line will traverse. Table \nA5.1 summarizes the Project\u2019s impact on people, structures, and properties. \n \n4. \nUse  of  the  ROW  easement  for  the  transmission  lines,  including  the  land  required  for \nsteel towers to be erected inside the Salcon Power Plant Complex, is covered by an agreement \nto  be  finalized  between  KSPC,  PSALM  and  SPC.  For  ROW  passing  through  private  lands, \nlandowners will be paid at current fair market value. The initial standard rate used to calculate \ncompensation was P389.00 per square meter (m2). After negotiations with affected people and \nto  reflect  the  latest  Schedule  of  Unit  Base  Market  Value  for  Residential,  Commercial  and \nIndustrial Lands for the Municipality of Naga in Cebu, the rate was increased to P813 per m2. \nWhile the land use is residential, NGCP adopted the valuation for industrial lands. \n \n\n                                                 \n36  The  National  Grid  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  was  awarded  the  25-year  concession  contract  to  manage  the \n\ncountry's power grid and in January 2009 took over these operations from TransCo. \n\n\f38     Appendix 5 \n\nTable A5.1: Impact of the Korea Electric Power Corporation Project Transmission Line \n \n\nDescription \nEstimated Area of Affected Private Landa \nEstimated Area of Affected Land inside Salcon Power Complex \nEstimated Number of Affected Houses \nEstimated Number of Affected Structures \nEstimated Number of People Affected by the Project \n\nLandowner \nTenant \nStructure Owner \nRelocated Households \n\nImpact Figures \n6,327 m2 \n9,467 m2 \n10 \n9 \n \n5 \n4 \n13 \n10 \n\n    m2 =   square meter. \n\na Residential use but officially classified as industrial lands. \n\nResettlement Principles and Policy Framework \n\n    Source: Korea Electric Power Corporation SPC Power Corporation. \n \n5. \nHouse  and  structure  owners  will  be  paid  the  replacement  cost  of  their  houses  and \nstructures. Relocated households will be granted disturbance compensation. Together with the \ntenants,  landowners  will  be  compensated  for  affected  crops,  plants,  and  trees.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement cost for the project transmission line is estimated at P7 million.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  the  project  transmission  line  recognize  the \nnational and local laws such as the Republic Act 8974,37 RA 7279, Article VII, Urban Renewal \nand Resettlement (Sections 26 and 28), and relevant ADB policies and operations manuals, in \nparticular  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  (OM)  F2  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (2006). 38 The  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  the  project \ntransmission line will comply with ADB social safeguard requirements.  \n \n7. \nThe  primary  objective  of  this  short  resettlement  plan  is  to  identify  impacts  and  plan \nmeasures to mitigate various losses due to implementation of the project transmission line. The \nresettlement  plan  is  based  on  the  general  findings  of  the  census  survey,  field  visits,  and \nmeetings  with  various  project-affected  people  in  the  affected  area.  Taking  into  account  the \nvarious losses, the entitlement matrix provides for compensation and resettlement assistance to \nall those affected including nontitleholders. In general terms, the people affected by the project \ntransmission  line  will  be  entitled  to  the  following:  (i)  payment  for  nonagricultural  lands  (i.e., \nresidential,  industrial,  commercial  land);  (ii)  payment  for  crops,  plants,  and  trees;  (iii)  payment \nfor  houses  and  other  structures;  and  (iv)  grant  for  disturbance  compensation  to  relocated \nhouseholds. \n \nfor  affected \n8. \nhouseholds losing their source of income and income opportunity. The census survey identifies \n10  households  living  along  the  route  of  the  project  transmission  line  that  currently  derive  their \nlivelihood  from  working  as  laborers  and  construction  workers,  operating  a  small  convenience \nstore,  raising  livestock,  among  others.  The  construction  of  the  project  transmission  line  will \nrequire  relocation  of  10  households.  The  affected  households  will  self  relocate  to  locations  of \ntheir choice. They are likely to resettle within the same vicinity but outside the 30-meter ROW \n\nincome  restoration  measures \n\nThe  policy  also  provides \n\nintegrated \n\n                                                 \n37  Republic  Act  No.  8974.

Most  of  the  people  affected  rely  on  wages  for  their  livelihood  hence  their  income  will  be \ntemporarily affected during reconstruction of their dwelling units. In addition to compensation for \nstructures  at  replacement  cost,  they  will  be  provided  disturbance  compensation  sufficient  to \ncover  their  expenses  while  reconstructing  their  houses  and/or  structures.  Skilled  workers  and \nlaborers from among the affected households will be prioritized for project-related employment. \nThis requirement is clearly specified in the terms of reference for contractors. The literacy and \nskills training program of the Social Development Plan will give priority to affected people who \nlack skills and other directly affected people who wish to learn new livelihood skills. \n \n9. \nA detailed entitlement matrix lists various types of subproject losses, identification and/or \neligibility, and entitlements; and provides basic parameters for preparation of compensation and \nresettlement  benefits  (Table  A5.2).

All interviewed households are headed by \nmales from 27 to 67 years of age. Almost all (11 or 92%) are in the working age group (15\u201364 \nyears).  Most  of  them  (8  or  67%)  work  as  construction  workers  or  laborers,  while  the  rest  are \nself-employed including a pedicab driver, a sari-sari (neighborhood store) owner, and a livestock \ntrader.  All  earn  more  than  Cebu  provincial  monthly  per  capita  poverty  threshold  of  P1,085.00:  \n3 households report monthly earnings of P3,000\u2013P6,000, 6 report monthly earnings of P6000\u2013\nP12,000, and 2 report relatively high monthly income of P12,000. \n \nAll the interviewed households own their houses with floor areas ranging from 6.75 m2 to \n11. \n96  m2.  Most  houses  are  relatively  small  with  floor  areas  of  20  m2  and  below.  The  rest  are \naverage-size  houses  ranging  from  21  m2  to  40  m2.  Most  of  the  houses  have  strong  wall  and \nroofing materials like galvanized iron sheets, concrete walls, lumber, and plywood; while the rest \nuse light materials such as bamboo, salvage materials, and nipa shingles. \n \n12. \n\nNGCP prepared a list of affected families (AFs), which was attested by barangay officials.  \n\n \nTable A5.3: List of Affected Relocated Household and Structure Owners  \n\n \nAP# \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n\n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n\nType \nof AP \nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \n\nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \nR, SO \nSO \nSO \nSO \n\nType of Structure \n\nBungalow \nBungalow \nBungalow \nBungalow; Other Structures \nBungalow; Other Structures \n\nFloor \nArea (m2) \n40.76 \n25.00 \n17.50 \n83.41 \n39.90 \n\nBungalow \nBungalow \nBungalow \nShanty \nBungalow \nHut Structure* \nPig Pen \nShanty \n\n11.10 \n25.75 \n26.50 \n16.00 \n16.00 \n8.59 \n14.70 \n2.70 \n\nMaterial \n\nRoofing \nGI Sheets \nGI Sheets \nGI Sheets \nGI Sheets \nGI Sheets \n\nGI sheets \nGI sheets \nGI sheets \nGI sheets \nGI sheets \nGI Sheets \nGI sheets \nGI Sheets \n\nSiding \nCHB \nCHB \nCHB \nCHB \nLM, iron \ngrill \nCHB \nPlywood \nCHB \nCHB \nCHB \nLM \nCHB \nLM \n\nFlooring \nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete; LM \n\nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete \nConcrete \nBamboo and Concrete \nConcrete \nBamboo \n\nCHB  =  concrete  hollow  block;  GI  =  galvanized  iron;  AP  =  affected  person;  R  =  relocate;  SO  =  structure  owner;  LM  = \ncombination of lumber, plywood, bamboo mat, bamboo split; Other Structures = may include convenience store, shed, \nstockhouse or pigpen. \nNote: Actual size and type of materials will be validated prior to payment of compensation. \nSource: Korea Electric Power Corporation SPC Power Corporation, July 2009. \n \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\nE. \n \n13. \nThe project transmission line and related development activities were discussed with the \nlocal  communities  during  the  consultation  meetings  at  the  sites.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n\n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe \nhow  the  project  would  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  how  it  is  linked  to  the  poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \n\n \nPower  generated  by  the  Project  will  be  connected  to  the  local  grid,  which  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of \nproviding affordable, universal electric service by 2011. Increasing power supplies to local grids will bring the benefits of \nelectricity  to  remote  communities,  including  better  health  care,  sanitation,  and  education;  greater  income-earning \nopportunities; and higher living standards.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.    Key Issues  \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting economic development of the Visayas region by providing \nneeded  power  to  support  economic  activities.  The  Project  will  generate  employment  and  the  barangays  (districts), \nmunicipality, province, and region will benefit directly from the Project through additional financial resources provided by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code (LGC)a and Energy Regulation (ER) 1-94 from the Department of Energy.b \nThe project developer will assist the municipality in tapping the funds provided by Section 289 of the LGC and ER 1-94. \nIncreased  economical  and  efficient  base-load  generation  capacity  in  the  region  will  enable  the  Government  to  meet \ndemand for electricity in 2011. A positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect \nimpact will be due to the increased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity. \n \n\n2.  Design Features.  \n \nThe Project is establishing a 200 megawatt (MW) thermal power project using circulating fluidized bed combustion boiler \ntechnology in Colon barangay of Naga City, in the province of Cebu. The Project includes the design and construction of \nan associated line to connect the plant to the New Naga Substation. The project developer will implement livelihood and \ncommunity  development  programs  as  part  of  the  Social  Development  Plan  (SCP)  and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility \ninitiative. \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable. \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project requires minimal land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nKSPC  will  provide  employment  opportunities  for  qualified  locals,  and  will  contribute  directly  and  indirectly  to  business \nopportunities  in  the  area.  Priority  will  be  given  to  qualified  residents  of  Naga  for  employment  in  plant  operation  to \nminimize the influx of migrants, who would exert tremendous financial pressures on the delivery of basic services by the \nhost municipality. Antipollution technology and devices will be installed to eradicate air pollutants and ensure they do not \ninfiltrate  nearby  communities.  KSPC  will  continue  monitoring  the  health  of  local  communities,  and  contribute  to  the \nimprovement  of  health  services  and  facilities.  KSPC  will  continue  to  provide  periodic  medical  missions  with  free \nmedicines. \n \nKSPC acquired land for the coal-fired power plant through open and competitive bidding held in November 2005 by NPC \nand  PSALM.  The  land,  also  called  Naga  land,  was  leased  to  KSPC  for  25  years  and  will  be  solely  used  for  the \nconstruction,  testing,  operation,  management,  and  maintenance  of  the  new  power  plant.  KSPC  has  provided  financial \nassistance  and  the  needed  labor  force  to  construct  dwelling  units  for  relocated  families.  KSPC  provided  basic \n\n\fAppendix 6     45 \n\ninfrastructure  and  utilities,  such  as  a  new  access  road,  power,  and  water  supply  in  the  relocation  site.  Due  diligence \nconfirms  that  no  outstanding  issues  relate  to  those  affected  by  the  construction  of  the  power  plant  (Supplementary \nAppendix 4 on environment and social due diligence report).  \n \nFor the proposed KSPC transmission  line, acquisition  of public  and private land  will affect livelihood  patterns of people \nliving in villages close to the project site. In addition to permanent private land losses, standing crops, plants, and trees \nlocated  within  the  transmission  line  right-of-way  corridors  will  also  be  affected.  During  construction,  activities  over \n4\u20135 years would result in movement of construction materials, equipment, and temporary in-migration of labor force dust, \nand  noise  pollution  and  may  contribute  to  pressure  on  water  resources,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management \nsystems.  The  Project  is  expected  to  generate  livelihood  and  employment  opportunities  during  plant  construction  and \noperation.  KSPC  has  adopted  measures  to  address  community  concerns  about  compensation  packages  for  land \nacquisition,  replacement  of  agricultural  land,  and  apprehension  of  environmental  pollution  due  to  the  Project,  including \nredress of grievances. \n \nNo indigenous peoples reside in Naga City. Most of the household population classify themselves as Cebuano. Since no \nindigenous  peoples  will  be  affected  by  the  Project,  it  is  categorized  as  C  with  respect  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). \n \nAs  part  of  its  corporate  social  responsibility,  the  project  company  developed  an  SDP,  which  covers  proposed \ninterventions of KSPC such as health, sanitation, and nutrition; education; and donations to support local government unit \ncommunity  programs  for  the  various  project  stakeholders.  An  annual  budget  of  P240,000  is  allocated  for  SDP \nimplementation. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe  Government  initiated  discussions  with  the  local  community  in  October  2004  during  the  formal  scoping  meeting;  a \nsecond  meeting  was  conducted  on  6  August  2005  as  a  public  hearing  on  the  findings  of  the  environmental  impact \nassessment for the Project. During the meeting, the Project's potential environmental and social impacts, land acquisition, \nrelocations, mitigation measures, and monitoring programs were discussed. Concerns raised were clarified and recorded, \nand mitigating measures incorporated in the reports. During project implementation, a multipartite monitoring team will be \nestablished,  comprising  officials  of  relevant  government  agencies,  contractor,  consultants,  and  local  government  units. \nThe team will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the monitoring program to ensure that public resistance to \ndevelopment is controlled through conduct of IEC and continuous implementation of the SDP.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing       \n\n   Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n  \nThe  community  and  various  stakeholders  were  consulted  in  different  venues  for  participation  in  the  study.  These \nconsultations  include  informal  interviews,  a  formal  scoping  meeting,  and  public  hearing.  Residents  and  other  project \nstakeholders  were  given  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  possible  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  Project.  Local \ngovernment  officials  from  cities  and  barangays  have  shown  their  support  for  the  Project  through  issuance  of  official \nendorsement.  \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues. Women are normally responsible for caring for the family especially attending to basic health needs of \nchildren.  If  the  relocated  untitled  families  continue  to  live  at  the  site  close  to  the  power  plant,  incidence  of  illness  may \nincrease and the women will have to carry the burden of caring for sick children.  \n \n2.
