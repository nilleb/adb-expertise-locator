This additional financing will provide loans to Sri Lankan banks to encourage them \nto  grow  their  SME  portfolios,  and  will  extend  the  current  successful  project,  which  otherwise \nwould close ahead of schedule, through March 2020. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprise exclusion. A vibrant SME sector has the potential \nto  mitigate  several  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  most  difficult  development  challenges.1  SMEs  have  higher \ngrowth potential, can create jobs, and, over time, increase the tax base at a quicker pace than \nlarger  enterprises.  They  can  also  reduce  regional  inequalities.  While  all  firms  in  Standard  & \nPoor's  Sri  Lanka  20,  the  main  national  stock  market  index,  are  headquartered  in  Colombo, \nSMEs  are  spread  throughout  the  country.  For  women,  whose  participation  in  the  Sri  Lankan \nworkforce  lags  that  of  international  peers,  and  for  youths,  whose  unemployment  rate  exceeds \nthe national average, start-up businesses offer an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the \neconomy.  A  more  vibrant  SME  sector  could  also  increase  exports  and  attract  foreign  direct \ninvestment. \n \nAccess to finance is the main challenge for SMEs. The World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Survey \n4. \nfound that 30% of Sri Lankan firms identified  it as a major constraint,  a percentage surpassed \nonly  by  Mongolia,  Nepal,  and  Afghanistan  among  the  developing  member  economies  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Only  in  Tonga  are  firms  more  reliant  on  internal  funding  for \nnew investments, and just 25% of Sri Lankan firms said that they did not need a loan, the lowest \namong  ADB  developing  members.2  High  financial  barriers  are  even  more  imposing  for  often-\nexcluded  segments  such as SMEs  that  have not  borrowed  previously  from  a  bank,  are led  by \nwomen, or are located outside of Colombo. \n \n5. \nRecognizing these difficulties, the government has prioritized SMEs\u2019 financial inclusion. \nThis involves business development services, initiatives to promote venture capital funding, and \nprograms  such  as  the  ADB  credit  line  to  encourage  banks  to  target  the  SME  segment.  SME \nfinancing has been identified and enhanced as a priority in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka3 and is being supported by other development partners.4 \n \n\n                                                \n1  The  project  uses  the  Sri  Lankan  government\u2019s  definition  of  SMEs,  which  is  annual  turnover  of  less  than \nSLRs750 million,  fewer  than  300  employees  if  a  manufacturer,  or  fewer  than  200  employees  if  in  the  service \nsector. The definition effectively includes microenterprises. \n\n2  World Bank. Enterprise Surveys. http:// http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/data (accessed August 2017). \n3  ADB.  2017.

The  government\u2019s  focus  on  SMEs\u2019  financial  inclusion  remains \n6. \nrelevant given developments in the Sri Lankan banking during 2016\u20132017. The Central Bank of \nSri  Lanka  has  raised  interest  rates  three  times  since  February  2016.  Tighter  monetary \nconditions have reduced private sector credit growth, which decreased from 6.2%  in January\u2013\nMay  2016  to  4.5%  in  January\u2013May  2017.  In  a  restrictive  environment,  initiatives  to  promote \nfinancial inclusion of SMEs have more significance because banks may be inclined to focus on \nestablished client bases. \n \nOriginal  project.  ADB  approved  in  2016  an  SME  credit  line  that  is  on  track  for \n7. \ncompletion.5  The  original  project  used  incentives  and  penalties  to  promote  financial  inclusion. \nLike other SME projects, it set requirements for onlending to underrepresented segments such \nas  women-led  SMEs  and  SMEs  that  had  previously  not  borrowed  from  a  bank.  In  contrast  to \nother  credit  lines,  banks  choose  their  own  disbursement  targets  but  incur  sharp  financial \npenalties  for  not  achieving  the  targets  within  3  months.6  Moreover,  banks  that  have  not \ndisbursed  80%  of  their  allocation  and  met  their  financial  inclusion  targets  within  5  months  are \nnot  eligible  to  participate  in  the  next  semiannual  allocation,  effectively  ceding  more  funding  to \ntheir competition. \n \n8. \nThis mix of incentives and disincentives has worked well. To avoid being penalized and \nexcluded from future funding rounds amid a restrictive monetary climate, banks have overshot \ntheir  financial  inclusion  targets.  Capitalizing  on  the  results  of  these  incentives,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment increased after the first 12 months the amount available at each funding round and \nraised  the  financial  inclusion  targets.  Despite  higher  targets,  banks  have continued  to  perform \nbeyond  expectation  (Figure).  The  additional  financing  continues  this  approach,  which  the  Sri \nLanka Solar Rooftop Development Project has adopted as well.7 \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2016.

Manila. \n\n6  The  original  project  ran  a  pilot  allowing  banks  to  bid  on  their  borrowing  rate.  Because  the  auction  limited \nparticipation,  the  government  requested  a  conventional  allocation  system  that  allowed  all  eligible  banks  to \nparticipate. However, the banks continue both to identify their borrowing quantity and to incur a financial penalty for \nnonperformance. \n\n7  ADB.  2017.

Based on banks\u2019 positive response to project incentives, ADB and MOF increased the targets in February 2017. \n2. Targeted  SMEs  include  SMEs  that  are  (i)  located  outside  of  Colombo  District,  (ii)  borrowing  for  working  capital \nwhere  fixed  or  financial  assets  are  not  pledged  as  collateral,  (iii)  led  by  women,  or  (iv)  first-time  borrowers  of  a \nlicensed or specialized commercial bank. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9. \nThe  original  project  included  incentives  for  banks  to  establish  an  ADB-compliant \nenvironmental and social safeguard management program. Participating banks can only lend to \nsubprojects  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  if  they  have  an  ADB-approved \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system.  Otherwise,  lending  is  limited  to  subprojects \nclassified  category  C  for  the  environment.  At  project  inception,  only  three  banks  had  ADB-\napproved  safeguard  systems.  Recognizing  their  competitive  disadvantage,  two  banks  have \nsince introduced safeguard systems and four more banks are working with ADB to develop their \nown. Collectively, these nine banks are responsible for more than 80% of lending in Sri Lanka. \n \n10. \nThe  original  project  also  strongly  emphasized  data  collection.  Little  information  was \navailable on  SMEs  or their  borrowings  when the  original  project  was structured. To  rectify this \nshortcoming, the technical assistance (TA) attached to the original project funded a third party to \ncollect data on the SMEs participating in the project. This data is publicly available and can be a \nresource  to  the  government,  other  development  agencies,  and  academics.8  This  sound \nmanagement information system strengthens subproject monitoring and implementation. \n \n11. \nThis data also provides insights into how the project is helping SMEs. For example, as of \nMay  2017,  26%  of  the  SMEs  had  taken  a  previous  loan  from  the  same  bank.  With  their  own \nfunds, those banks  extended  the  loans for  an  average of  49  months,  but  with ADB  funds, the \naverage  tenor  increased  by  31%.  The  longer  tenor  of  ADB  funding  also  supports  capital \nexpenditures,  which  represent  a  clear  majority  of  investment  activity.  The  manufacturing \nindustry  has  been  one  of  the  prime  beneficiaries  and  has  received  17%  of  the  funding. \nMoreover,  the  data  provides  insights  into  these  SMEs.  First-time  borrowers,  for  instance,  are \ngenerally  newer  businesses  with  seven  employees  on  average;  other  SMEs  have  about  30. \nOnly businesses owned solely by women are managed entirely by women, which underlines the \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.

Given \n\nOutput 1: Financing to SMEs through formal intermediaries increased. The original \n\nimportance of this project\u2019s focus on gender mainstreaming.9 A supplementary \u201cImpact Stories\u201d \nappendix  provides  further  examples  of  how  the  original  project  has  helped  small-business \nowners.10 \n \nthe  project\u2019s  strong  performance\u2014\n12. \nparticularly  in  reaching  SMEs  that  are  first-time  borrowers,  women-led,  or  located  outside  of \nColombo\u2014and its compliance with ADB\u2019s additional financing eligibility criteria, the government \nrequested  $150 million  to  scale  up  this  project  for  four  more  funding  rounds  of  $37.5  million \neach.11  Given  other  demands  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  resource  envelope,  ADB  and  the  government \neventually agreed to an additional funding request of $75 million for three more rounds of $25 \nmillion each. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe project\u2019s impact and outcome are unchanged. The  impact will be that employment \nopportunities in SMEs have increased.12 The outcome will be that SMEs\u2019 access to finance has \nbeen strengthened. The additional financing increases the outcome indicator\u2014$50 million to be \nlent via the credit line to SMEs that are (i) located outside of Colombo District, (ii) borrowing for \nworking capital, (iii) led by women, or (iv) new borrowers\u2014to $102.5 million. \n \nC. \n \n14. \noutput of disbursing $100 million to participating banks by 2020 will be raised to $175 million. \n \n15. \nOutput 2: Innovative SME financing schemes developed. This output is unchanged. \nThe  original  performance  indicators,  which  established  the  auction  pilot  in  June  2016  and \nprepared a proposal for a Sri Lankan SME credit guarantee institution in December 2016, have \nbeen achieved. Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet has since approved the proposal to establish an SME credit \nguarantee institution, which ADB is actively supporting. \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  SMEs  in  targeted  clusters  to  access  financial  services \nenhanced.  This  output  is  unchanged.  The  TA  attached  to  the  original  project  is  funding  this \nactivity,  and  its  work  is  scheduled  for  completion  by  2018.13  The  targeted  clusters  are \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) and business process outsourcing, fruits and \nvegetables, and processed food and beverage. \n \n17. \nOutput 4: International competitiveness of the ICT\u2013business process outsourcing \ncluster strengthened. The TA attached to the original project funded this activity (footnote 13). \nThe output is unchanged and will increase the presence and networks of women interested or \nworking in ICT and business process outsourcing. \n                                                \n9  Data is based on the portfolio of 292 subloans as of May 2017, and figures will evolve as the portfolio grows. \n10 Impact Stories (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 The  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  It  (i)  remains  technically  feasible,  economically \nviable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s \nexpected outcome; and (iv) is consistent with the current country partnership strategy. \n\n12 Government of Sri Lanka. 2017.

With 5 years as the average duration of an SME loan in the original project, banks can \nreuse the  funds  twice  during  the  10-year  borrowing  period.  Moreover,  SMEs  have  contributed \non  average  35%  equity  to  the  subprojects.  The  combined  effect  is  that  ADB\u2019s  $175  million  is \nexpected to support $538 million of SME subprojects.14 \n \n20. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $75 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand project agreements. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches of about $25 million each. \nEach  tranche  will  have a 10-year  term  and a  disbursement-linked  bullet  repayment.  Based  on \nthe foregoing, the average loan maturity is 11 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. \n \nE. \n \nThe  government  will  relend  the  local  currency  equivalent  to  participating  banks  at  the \n21. \nbanking  industry\u2019s  average  weighted  deposit  rate,  and  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk. \nThe  loans  will  have  10-year  tenors  and  bullet  repayments  that  mirror  the  government\u2019s \nrepayments to ADB. \n \n22. \nAn  increase  in  the  banks\u2019  development  targets  is  the  biggest  change  in  the \nimplementation  arrangements  from  the  original  loan.

Economically,  the  gains  are  likely  to \ncome from the project\u2019s requirement to lend to SMEs that are struggling to access the banking \nsystem. Providing SMEs with better access to finance has a multiplier effect because SMEs can \nborrow to (i) invest in more productive technologies and (ii) enlarge their businesses to achieve \neconomies  of  scale.  These  gains  are  especially  significant  in  economies  such  as  Sri  Lanka\u2019s, \nwhere unmet SME credit demand is significant.19 Financially, the banks assess each subproject \nfor its capacity to make timely repayment. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  integrity  due  diligence  on  each  participating  bank \nindicates  moderate  risk.  The  project\u2019s  design  includes  several  governance  mechanisms,  such \nas  (i)  steering  committee  oversight,  (ii)  well-developed  project  reporting  that  provides  detailed \ndata on the subloans, and (iii) other measures detailed in the  PAM. With these measures, the \noverall financial management arrangements are considered adequate. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n27. \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Mass  Media.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nC. \n \n28. \nPoverty  impact.  Although  Sri  Lanka  has  made  notable  progress  in  reducing  poverty, \nregional  imbalances  remain.  SMEs  struggle  to  borrow  for  working  capital  because  they  often \nlack  real  estate  or  financial  assets  that  banks  require  as  collateral.  In  response,  the  project \ntargets  SMEs  that  have  less  access  to  financial  resources  but  have  a  key  role  in  reducing \nincome  and  social  imbalances.  These  SMEs  are  (i)  located  outside  of  Colombo  District, \n(ii) borrowing  for  working  capital  without  pledging  financial  assets  or  real  estate,  (iii)  led  by \nwomen,  or  (iv)  first-time  borrowers  from  a  licensed  commercial  or  specialized  bank.  The \nexpected project impact includes employment creation and increased income, especially among \nthe targeted SMEs. \n \nGender and social dimensions. Sri Lanka\u2019s low female labor participation rate of 39% \n29. \nsuggests  a large pool  of  untapped human resources for  national  economic  development. One \nmeasure to address this is to support women\u2019s greater involvement in SMEs. Thus, the project \nis  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  because  of  its  large  potential  to  contribute  to \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and gender equity. In view of this, the project requires at least 20% of \n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nsubborrowers  to  be  SMEs  led  by  women.  This  is  a  fourfold  increase  in  the  original  project\u2019s \ntarget,  which  has  been  raised  because  the  banks\u2014when  properly  incentivized\u2014have  proven \nthat they can identify creditworthy SMEs led by women.20 \n \nD. \n \n30. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  financial \nintermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. Subproject selection \ncriteria will ensure that participating banks exclude SME subprojects with activities under ADB\u2019s \nProhibited  Investments  Activity  List  and  with  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts (category C). For the environment, the rules for participating banks are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nExclude all subprojects with environmental impacts (categories A and B). These \nbanks may only lend to subprojects that are included in an ADB-preapproved list \nof  subprojects21  or  that  the  project  management  unit\u2019s  safeguard  specialist  has \nconfirmed as category C for the environment. \nExclude  subprojects  with  significant  safeguard  impacts  (category  A)  but  include \nsubprojects  with  impacts  that  are  not  significant  (category  B).  ADB  will  require \nthese  banks  to  maintain  a  safeguard  and  environmental  management  system \nthat complies with ADB requirements and national laws.22 \n\n \n31. \nSafeguard  due  diligence  concluded  that  five  banks  currently  have  safeguard  and \nenvironmental  management  systems  that meet  ADB\u2019s  standards.  Due  diligence also suggests \nthat  most  of  the  subprojects  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  will  involve  small-scale \nbuilding  construction,  the  risks  of  which  are  manageable.  As  part  of  the  original  project\u2019s \nimplementation,  an  ADB  safeguard  officer  has  conducted  site  visits  to  12  subprojects  and  did \nnot identify any material environmental or safeguard issues. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe  project\u2019s  overall  risk  is  low.  Its  benefits  are  expected  to  outweigh  its  costs.  Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nSome participating banks cannot \nmeet the onlending disbursement and \ndevelopment targets because of poor \nmanagement.  \n\nMitigation Measures \nThree months after the fund allocation date, participating banks \nare required to start paying interest to the government on their \nallocation, even if the bank has not yet onlent the funds to a \nsubloan. In addition, banks are not allowed to participate in the \nnext fund allocation unless they have met the disbursement and \ndevelopment targets. Finally, the steering committee may decide \nto reallocate any undisbursed funds prior to the last allocation to \n\n                                                \n20 In  further  support  of  the  promotion  of  women  entrepreneurship,  the  project  may  seek  grant  funding  from  the \nWomen  Entrepreneurs  Finance  Initiative,  a  World  Bank-managed  trust  fund  launched  in  October  2017.
