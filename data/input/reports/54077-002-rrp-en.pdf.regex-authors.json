THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to \u20ac30,000,000 (or its equivalent in Chinese yuan) to Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. \n(Jointown) for the Jointown COVID-19 Pharmaceutical Distribution Expansion Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The proceeds of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) proposed loan and a loan to be \nprovided by Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG) will be used to \nconstruct and/or expand three pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the PRC provinces of \nHainan, Hebei, and Jiangsu, and for Jointown\u2019s working capital needs.1 Jointown is the PRC\u2019s \nfourth largest pharmaceutical distributor and the only private company in the top five. \n \n3.  This project will increase access to more affordable pharmaceutical drugs and medical \ndevices and equipment for the underserved populations of the PRC\u2019s tier 2 and 3 cities and rural \nareas.2 As part of the broader response of ADB to the needs of its developing member countries \n(DMCs) during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the project will also \nsupport readiness for pharmaceutical surge capacity if the COVID-19 pandemic resurfaces and \nintensifies in the PRC. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n4.  Project identification. The project builds on a relationship that began when COVID-19 \nwas first identified. Before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December 2019, ADB \nmet with the senior management of Jointown and visited the company\u2019s largest logistics center in \nWuhan city, Hubei Province, as part of due diligence to support Jointown\u2019s planned expansion \nin 2020. \n \n5.  Soon after the visit, the COVID-19 pandemic began to intensify in the PRC, particularly in \nWuhan city where the client is headquartered. Quickly adapting to the needs of its DMCs and to \nclients such as Jointown, ADB in February 2020 approved a 2-year CNY130.0 million loan to \nJointown for the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, to fund Jointown\u2019s short-term working \ncapital needs to support the company\u2019s operations during the pandemic in the PRC.3 Jointown \nwas  one  of  the  pharmaceutical  distributors  designated  by  the  government  to  procure  and \ndistribute  medical  supplies  to  ensure  continued  availability  of  pharmaceuticals  during  the \npandemic.4 ADB\u2019s emergency response loan to Jointown has been fully disbursed. \n \n6.  Project  design.  ADB  will  provide  a  5-year  loan  to  Jointown  to  support  its  capital \nexpenditure needs to construct pharmaceutical distribution facilities in Haikou (Hainan Province), \nTangshan  (Hebei  Province),  and  Nanjing  (Jiangsu  Province)  through  Jointown\u2019s  regional \nsubsidiaries. These pharmaceutical distribution facilities will also include cold chain warehouses \n \n1  Pharmaceutical distribution facilities consist of warehouses and logistics fleets (delivery trucks) for distribution of \nmedicines and medical equipment.  \n2  Although one of the three facilities funded by ADB is located in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu Province, the facilities \nserve broader areas in the province including Tier 2 and 3 cities and other rural areas.   \n3  ADB. 2020.

The loan is part of ADB\u2019s broader COVID-19 response. While the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas abated in the PRC, the country remains susceptible to a sudden surge in cases as there is \nno proven treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 (as of September 2020). As the possibility of \nanother wave of infections remains, the World Health Organization has recommended that \nnational  authorities  ensure  operational  support  and  logistics,  including  by  preparing  surge \ncapacity and assessing the capacity of the local market to meet increased demand for medical \nand other essential supplies.5 ADB\u2019s support will ensure that Jointown can expand its distribution \ncapacity to help meet the PRC\u2019s pharmaceutical surge capacity requirements if the pandemic \npicks up once again in the PRC. The pharmaceutical distribution facilities will also have capacity \nto store COVID-19 vaccines.  \n1.   \n8.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n9.  Gender equality has reportedly been on the decline in the labor market in terms of \nemployment and pay gaps, as well as physical and sexual harassment. Gender diversity within \nthe workforce is important in the pharmaceuticals industry to ensure outreach to diversified clients. \nGlobally, women outnumber men in the pharmaceutical industry workforce, yet in the PRC, \nwomen continue to be underrepresented in senior and leadership positions. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] Measures for gender equality will look at sustaining these numbers \ngiven the current constraints due to COVID-19 impacts. The project will address this through a \ngender action plan (GAP), further aiming to improve gender inclusion by formalizing aspects of \nanti-harassment and awareness of gender equality issues across Jointown sites.6 \n \n10.  Borrower. Established in 1999 by Liu Baolin in Wuhan city, Jointown is the PRC's fourth \nlargest pharmaceutical distributor and the only privately owned distributor among the top five. \nJointown has been listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange since 2010 and, as \nof 25 September 2020, had a market capitalization of CNY31.8 billion ($4.7 billion). \n \n11.  Jointown procures pharmaceutical products and small medical devices, storing them in its \nlarge network of pharmaceutical distribution facilities to be sold subsequently to hospitals, clinics, \nand retail pharmacies throughout the PRC.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) reform of the logistics \nsystems for pharmaceuticals and consumables deepened and medicine supply mechanisms \nimproved; and (ii) capabilities in emergency medical assistance and disease prevention and \ncontrol strengthened.8  \n \n16.  Outcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  access  to  affordable \npharmaceutical and health care products in tier 2 and 3 cities improved. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) distribution capacity expanded, (ii) inclusive local \nemployment  for  health  care  service  delivery  generated,  (iii)  awareness  of  gender-based \nharassment at the workplace enhanced, and (iv) outreach to both men and women on accessing \naffordable pharmaceutical products in underserved areas expanded. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with two \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, and (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality.9 The objectives are also aligned \nwith the government\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020), particularly the aim to expand \nservices (education, health and elderly care), and to encourage greater private sector participation \nin the economy.10 \n \n19.  The loan will support the development of smarter health care service delivery systems to \nexpand access to quality and affordable health care. The project will also create jobs directly at \nthe three pharmaceutical distribution facilities targeted for expansion. The GAP will incorporate \nmeasures to empower women by generating inclusive employment within the pharmaceutical \nindustry, increasing awareness of gender-based harassment, and increasing outreach to both \nmen and women on accessing pharmaceutical products. \n \n20.  The project is also aligned with private sector operations for inclusive economic growth \nwhich is one of the strategic priority areas of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, \n2016\u20132020. This project will support commercially viable business models including in health.11 \n \n21.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which sets forth a plan for ADB to take a \nholistic approach to investing in health infrastructure. Through this plan, ADB envisioned investing \nin strengthening the supply of quality pharmaceuticals, medical goods, and information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) systems throughout Asia and the Pacific. The project further \naligns with ADB support for private sector approaches to address quality, efficiency, and financing \nissues in health infrastructure, as outlined in the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.12 \n \n \n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2016.

The loan will increase distribution of affordable and quality pharmaceuticals. The project \nwill also support investments in sophisticated ICT capabilities. Jointown\u2019s competitive advantage \nis its sophisticated ICT system, which allows it to collect data points to inform decision-making. \nIts efficient warehouse and inventory management systems were recognized when, at the peak \nof the COVID-19 pandemic in the PRC in early 2020, it was asked by the local government to \nmanage the warehouses of the Wuhan and Hubei branches of the Red Cross Society of China to \nclassify, store, and manage the inventory of donated goods. \n \n23.  Lessons from previous operations. The project builds on a relationship between ADB \nand Jointown that began when ADB approved the 2-year local currency loan to Jointown for the \nCOVID-19 Emergency Response Project (footnote 3). Since then, ADB has expanded its COVID-\n19 response as the pandemic has spread worldwide. The earlier transaction with Jointown has \ntaught  ADB  the  importance  of  having  a  sophisticated  logistical  network  of  pharmaceutical \nproducts and medical supplies to meet a sudden increase in demand related to the pandemic. \nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has abated in the PRC, the prolonged global health crisis and \nresulting economic crisis make it vital that ADB continues to be ready to ensure health security \nby responding to the evolving needs of DMCs and the private sector. \n \nD.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.13 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The National Medical Products Administration is the main agency in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) for regulating drugs and medical devices. It was established in 2018 as \npart of the State Administration for Market Regulation. Its main responsibilities include \ndrafting laws and regulations for drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics; regulating the \nregistration of drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics; and managing the standards of the \npharmaceutical industry. Other relevant regulatory bodies include the National Health \nCommission, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. \n \nKey legislation for the pharmaceutical industry includes the Drug Administration Law and \nits implementing rules. The law was first implemented in 1984 and the last major \namendment was in August 2019. The National Medical Products Administration has issued \na wide range of other regulations and measures to guide the pharmaceutical industry. \n \nPrice control of pharmaceutical drugs in the PRC was previously based on a scheme of \nmaximum retail drug prices set by the National Development and Reform Commission. In \nJune 2015, the government abolished this scheme with the exception of price controls for \ncertain drugs. In July 2017, a \u201czero-mark-up\u201d policy for public hospitals was introduced to \nensure that the price of pharmaceutical drugs charged by public hospitals to patients would \nbe the same as that paid to suppliers.   \nManagement  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013October 2025 \nOperations arrangements   \n \n13 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Revenue structure  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  Major cost structure  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  Operation and  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] Each subproject subsidiary will enter into \nmaintenance  separate  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contracts  with  subcontractors. \nJointown, at the group level, will centrally coordinate the construction of each center. \nJointown will comply with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time).  \nPerformance monitoring  Jointown will provide quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements to ADB. \nJointown will also report key performance indicators, including development indicators on \na regular basis. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n27.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n28.  ADB will provide a 5-year senior secured loan of up to \u20ac30.0 million (or its equivalent in \nChinese yuan) to finance Jointown\u2019s capital expenditure financing needs for three new and/or \nexpanded facilities in Hainan, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces and its working capital. The proceeds \nof ADB\u2019s loan and DEG\u2019s loan will expand Jointown\u2019s distribution capacity, and will expand access \nto and increase the availability of pharmaceuticals in the PRC. Jointown plays a critical role in the \nPRC\u2019s  health  system  as  it  is  able  to  consolidate  logistics  planning,  execution,  and \nsystem integration. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n29.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the project will enhance Jointown\u2019s corporate governance, and will \npromote private sector development further in the health sector in the PRC. ADB\u2019s presence will \nalso accelerate progress in gender equality at Jointown. The GAP includes measures to promote \nmore inclusive employment practices, enhance awareness of gender-based harassment in the \nworkplace, and increase outreach to both men and women on accessing pharmaceutical products \nin underserved areas. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n31.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n ", "6 \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n32.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).14 \n \n33.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n(E&S) impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for \nthe adverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. External consultants conducted an audit \nof Jointown\u2019s existing corporate environmental and social management system (ESMS) and E&S \ncompliance audits of the three pharmaceutical distribution facilities that will be financed by the \nADB loan.15  \n \n34.  The  audit  did  not  find  any  potential  significant  adverse,  irreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented E&S impacts that may be caused by the construction and/or expansion and \noperation of the three pharmaceutical distribution facilities. Jointown\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution \nfacilities, including those that will be financed by the ADB loan, are within government-established \nindustrial  zones  equipped  with  ancillary  services  such  as  water  and  power  supply,  waste \ncollection, and wastewater treatment. There are no natural habitats; critical habitats; legally \nprotected areas; or areas with cultural, historical, or religious significance within the project sites. \nJointown confirmed during due diligence that the three pharmaceutical distribution facilities are \ndesigned to withstand floods that may be caused by extreme weather events. Climate change \nimpact from the project will be minimal. Jointown's resource efficiency program includes using \ninformation  technology  for  efficient  warehouse  management  and  delivery  fleet  movement; \nefficient insulation, air conditioning and lighting; installation of roof-top solar panels; and piloting \nelectric trucks as potential future alternative to diesel trucks. Land for each of the government-\nestablished  industrial  zones  was  acquired  by  the  government  by  using  national  laws  and \nregulations  concerning  notification  and  compensation.  The  audit  found  that  there  were  no \noutstanding compensation issues or grievances at any of the sites. It is not anticipated that any \nof the facilities will require any additional land and, therefore, there will be no economic or physical \ndisplacement as a result of involuntary resettlement. The audit also determined that the locations \nof the facilities are not inhabited, used, or claimed by potentially vulnerable ethnic minorities. As \nsuch, there will be no activities that will directly and/or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, \ntraditional sociocultural beliefs and practices, and livelihood systems of distinct and potentially \nvulnerable ethnic minority groups. \n \n35.  Jointown has an existing ESMS which is cascaded from the corporate level to the \npharmaceutical distribution facilities. The audit recommended corrective actions to ensure that \nenvironmental, health, and safety (EHS) procedures during construction and operations are \nadequate and compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other social requirements. \nSpecifically, Jointown must: (i) adopt an enhanced ESMS by developing and updating existing \nstandard operating procedures for screening, categorizing, and for reviewing of potential risks \nand impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement and ethnic minorities (indigenous peoples) \nrelated to new pharmaceutical distribution facilities and expansion of existing pharmaceutical \n \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n15 The environmental due diligence (fully remote) and social due diligence (partially remote) were conducted remotely \nbecause of travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project served as the test case for the remote \nmethodology that was developed and supported internally within ADB.  \n ", "7 \ndistribution  facilities;  EHS  monitoring  and  reporting  during  construction  and  operation;  and \ngrievance redress; (ii) establish an E&S management unit, and engage a dedicated and qualified \nE&S head of department and qualified E&S officer(s) at the corporate level to ensure adoption \nand consistent implementation of Jointown\u2019s EHS and social procedures; and (iii) develop an \nannual E&S training plan for relevant staff at the corporate and facility levels. ADB\u2019s E&S \ncorrective action plan was consolidated with DEG\u2019s E&S action plan (ESAP). The company has \nagreed to implement the joint ADB-DEG ESAP. ADB will require Jointown to report on its progress \nin implementing the corrective actions; and on the E&S performance of the three pharmaceutical \ndistribution facilities, including compliance with ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List. \n \n36.  Jointown  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by \nnational laws and regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory \nto ADB before disbursement. The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance \nwith national labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001).16 The ESMS will also contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people \nfollowing ADB requirements. Jointown will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such \nlaws and (ii) the measures taken.17 \n \n37.  Gender  equality.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  Jointown  has  incorporated \nmeasures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key \nfeatures  of  the  GAP  are  as  follows:  (i)  promotion  of  inclusive  employment  opportunities, \n(ii) implementation of an effective anti-sexual harassment policy and response mechanism at \nheadquarters and within subsidiaries; and (iii) development of a training module on gender issues \nfor  dissemination  to  staff  and  contractors.  To  support  the  project\u2019s  development  target  of \naccessible and affordable pharmaceutical products in underserved areas, one gender action \nrelates to community outreach through corporate social responsibility sessions to raise awareness \nof the benefits of pharmaceutical products on health, encouraging equal access to affordable \nproducts for men and women. Jointown will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender \nmeasures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n38.  Jointown was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
