Subprogram  2  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  efforts  by  \n(i)  enhancing  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  (ii)  improving  the \nefficiency  of  administrative  systems \nin  support  of  SME  development  and  operations,  \n(iii)  strengthening  the  regulatory  framework  for  competition  policy,  and  (iv)  enhancing  SME \naccess to finance.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIncreasing  contribution  to  economic  growth. Healthy levels of private investment will \ncontinue to be essential to achieve the 7%\u20138% rate of annual economic growth and the 8 million \nnew  jobs  targeted  under  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020. \nIncreasingly,  such  contribution  is  expected  to  come  from  the  domestic  private  sector,  largely \ncomposed of SMEs.3The government has assisted the development of SMEs with a combination \nof  landmark  policy  reforms  since  2000.  As  a  result,  by  the  end  of  2011,  nearly  550,000 \nenterprises were registered in Viet Nam, up from 14,500 in 2000. SMEs represented 97% of the \ncountry\u2019s total number of firms, and 46% of gross domestic product (GDP). The domestic private \nsector  accounted  for  59%  of  total  employment  in  2011,  up  from  29%  in  2000.  By  industry,  the \nwholesale and retail, and vehicle repair subsectors account for nearly 40% of active enterprises, \nfollowed by manufacturing (18%) and construction (16%).   \n\n  \n4. \nThe  large  increase  in  the number  of  private  sector  companies  since  the approval  of  the \nEnterprise Law in 2000 has been followed by sustained increases in the average dimension and \nproductivity of the firms.4 From 2000 to 2010, the average capital per firm increased sixfold, and \nthe  average  net  revenue  per  employee  tripled.  In  addition,  the  contribution  of  SMEs  to  tax \nrevenue  has  become  increasingly  important.  By  the  end  of  2010,  of  the  336,000  enterprises \npaying taxes in Viet Nam, of which 318,000 were private enterprises, 13,000 were foreign-owned \nenterprises  and  about  5,000  were  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).5  While  the  government\u2019s \nachievements are impressive, more needs to be done to foster greater SME development. SMEs \nface challenges from a variety of sources including a complex bureaucracy, regulatory hurdles, \nand lack of financing. ADB continued commitment to financial sector and SOE reforms address \nsome of the key remaining challenges to private sector (see para. 28). \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  Viet  Nam  for  Supporting  the  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \nDevelopment Program. Manila (TA 8184-VIE). The technical assistance provides support to the implementation of \nthe post-program partnership framework agreed with the government. \n\n3   According  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  definition  (Decree  56/2009),  SMEs  comprise  all  companies  with  less  than  D100  billion \n\n($5 million)  chartered  capital  and  10\u2013300  workers.  For  the  trade  and  services  sector,  the  thresholds  are  lower           \n(10\u2013100 employees, and less than D50 billion in capital). \n\n4   The  government aims  to  increase  the  number of operating  SMEs  to 600,000  by  31  December 2015  and over  the \n\n5-year period, SMEs are expected to create 3.5\u20134.0 million jobs. \n\n5   Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2012. White Paper on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Viet Nam 2011. \n\nHa Noi. \n\n\f2 \n\nReducing  tax  and  compliance  costs.  The  administrative  burden \n\nImproving stakeholder dialogue and the statistical base for policy formulation. The \n5.  \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  in  designing  and  executing \nSME policies has been inadequate as the existing consultative framework is limited and largely \nad  hoc.  Stakeholders\u2019  participation  in  the  evaluation  of  past  policies,  the  formulation  of  new \nstrategic  plans,  and  the  improvement  of  the  statistical  base  for  policy  formulation  has  been \nlimited until the publication of the first SME White Paper in 2011.  \n \n6.  \nSimplifying  administrative  procedures.  Although  great  progress  has  been  achieved \nsince 2000 in simplifying administrative procedures for the registration of enterprises, important \nadministrative  burdens  remain.  The  total  number  of  regulations  in  Viet Nam  that  affect \nbusinesses  increased  dramatically  from  2005  to  2009.  As  a  result,  the  government  started \nimplementation  of  Project  30,  specifically  aimed  at  the  simplification  of  close  to  4,800 \nadministrative  procedures  at  the  national  and  local  levels  of  business  operations.6  The \nsimplification  of  administrative  procedures  has  been  shown  to  particularly  benefit  women \nentrepreneurs with lower average skills, representing a critical gender mainstreaming strategy.   \n \nimposed  on \n7.  \nbusinesses  translates  into  high  tax  compliance  costs.  On  average,  a  company  has  to  spend \n941 hours per year complying with tax payments, which ranks Viet Nam 138 out of 183 countries \nin  the  Doing  Business  Report  2013.7  In  addition,  despite  recent  improvements,  the  number  of \ndocuments required to process imports in Viet Nam is still above regional averages and the cost \nto  import  goods  has  steadily  increased.  Until  2012,  private  businesses  have  been  submitting \nmonthly  value-added  tax  (VAT)  declarations.  Filing  customs  declarations  could  take  close  to  a \nday as the declarations have to be handed in personally. In addition, inadequate communication \nbetween  the  Treasury  and  commercial  banks  prevents  the  prompt  release  of  goods  from \ncustoms after dues have been paid. \n \n8. \nImproving  the  quality  of  legal  texts  and  SME  access  to  legal  services.  A  large \nnumber  of  regulations  for  business  development  currently  being  applied  contain  numerous \ninconsistencies.  Further,  clear  guidance  for  the  preparation  of  regulatory  impact  assessments \n(RIAs)  is  required  to  better  identify  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  enactment  of \nproposed  regulations,  and  to  filter  out  inefficient  or  rent-seeking  practices.  Increasingly,  SMEs \nhave  been  highlighting  limited  access  to  legal  services  as  an  important  constraint  to  their \ndevelopment.  \n \n9. \nReview  of  the  5-year-old  competition  policy  framework  required.  The  framework \nexhibits weaknesses in the indicators used to identify dominant market position, and the system \nof  penalties  and  enforcement  measures  are  not  strong  enough  to  stop  violations  effectively. \nViet Nam\u2019s  experience  with  the  full  application  of  the  Competition  Law,  2005  is  limited,  thus \noutreach  and  education  are  key  priorities.  In  addition,  the  Enterprise  Law,  2005  requires  the \nincorporation of critical underdeveloped provisions, such as corporate governance practices and \nelimination  of  limitations  on  registration  of  foreign  businesses.  Improvements  to  competition \npolicy will assist in increasing the average size of SMEs, which has been shown to assist female \nemployment growth. 8  \n\n                                                \n6   Master Plan to Simplify Administrative Procedures in the fields of State Governance for 2007\u20132010 (Project 30). \n7  World  Bank.  2013.  Doing  Business  Report  2013:  Smarter  Regulations  for  Small  and  Medium-Size  Enterprises. \n\nWashington DC. \n\n8   Women  represented  43%  of  the  labor  force  in  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  40%  in  small  enterprises  (Central \nInstitute  for  Economic  Management  (CIEM).  2013.  Characteristics  of  the  Vietnamese  Business  Environment. \nHa Noi).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nLimited  access  to  capital.  The  rapid  growth  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  financial  sector  has  not \n10. \nbenefited all segments of the economy equally. In fact, access to finance continues to be cited as \na  major  constraint  for  45%  of  small  firms,  a  percentage  significantly  higher  than  for  larger \nenterprises.  A  government  survey  reports  that  65%  of  enterprises  in  the  manufacturing  sector \ndepend  on  retained  earnings to finance  investment,  with a  very  small  group,  estimated  at  5%\u2013\n10% of SMEs, obtaining credit from banks. Women entrepreneurs represented 34% of the loan \napplications in 2009, and continue to face greater limitations in access to credit in the absence of \nland use certificates. Overall, the SME sector accounts for about 30% of total credit as of the end \nof  2012,  which  is  relatively  low  compared  with  its  GDP  contribution  of  46%.  Compounding  the \ntraditional  challenges  in  obtaining  and  using  collateral,  the  current  regulatory  framework  limits \nnoncollateral forms of debt financing such as leasing.  \n \nThe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  Eliminating constraints for  the further  development \n11.  \nof  the  SME  sector  remains  a  key  pillar  of  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u2013\n2020,  and  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP),  2011\u20132015.  The  government\u2019s \nstrategic  policy  framework  for  SME  development  is  contained  in  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  SME  growth  continues to be  critical  to  overcome  the  structural \ngrowth  limitations  created  by  the  predominance  of  SOEs  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy.  SOEs  still \ncapture  a  priority  share  of  available  financial  resources  for  investment  from  public  sources, \ndespite evidence of low returns on capital and modest employment creation. The potential of the \nSME sector for employment creation suggests the need to assist improved access to finance and \nland,  while  continuously  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  their  operations.  In  addition, \nfuture productivity growth in Viet Nam will largely depend on the technological and skills upgrade \nof the domestic private sector.    \n \n12.   Reform sequence. Subprogram 1 supported the implementation of numerous milestones \nin strategic policy reforms for SME development such as the publication of the White Paper on \nSmall and Medium Sized Enterprises in Viet Nam 2011, which was the basis for formulation of \nthe SME Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 in subprogram 2. Subprogram 1 provided support to the \nissuance  of  Decree  56/2009,  which  redefined  the  government\u2019s  support  for  SME  development \nand  identified  the  roles of government  agencies  in implementing  SME  development  policies.  In \nsubprogram  2,  key  provisions  of  the  decree  have  been  supported,  such  as  initiatives  for  the \nprovision  of  legal  services  for  SMEs.  Subprogram  1  also  supported  the  establishment  of  a \nnational  web-based  system  for  business  registration,  while  subprogram  2  assisted  its \nimplementation  at  the  provincial  level  and  its  integration  with  tax  information  systems.  With  a \nview  toward  improving  access  to  finance,  subprogram  1  supported  the  establishment  of  the \ncredit guarantee  scheme within  Viet  Nam  Development  Bank (VDB),  and the  issuance  of  initial \nregulations  governing  leasing  and  equity  finance  options  through  the  market  for  unlisted \ncompanies  in  Ha  Noi  Stock  Exchange  (HNX).  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  improved \nthe credit guarantee scheme to ensure a more efficient distribution of credit risk, and integrated \nleasing practices into the Law on Credit Institutions, 2010 lending it consistency. Since the start \nof Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to SME development in Viet Nam, over 300,000 new \nenterprises  have  been registered,  contributing  some  60%  of  total  private  sector  employment  in \n2012 (from 53% in 2007). Partly as a result of the new national web-based business registration \nsystem,  the  cost  of  starting  a  business  has  been  reduced  by  almost  10%  since  2007,  and  the \ndays required to process a business application have been reduced by 30%. The share of SMEs \nin  outstanding  loans  from  commercial  banks  has  almost  doubled  from  15%  to  nearly  30%  in \n2012, and their contribution to investment is now close to 65% of the total. \n\n13.  \n\nLessons.  ADB  has  provided  direct  assistance  to  the  government  to  support  SME  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ndevelopment through a combination  of  policy-based cluster loan and technical assistance.9  An \nimportant  lesson  learned  is  that  SME  development  will  largely  depend  on  a  series  of  parallel \nreforms  in  the  country\u2019s  financial  and  economic  structure.  In  recognition  of  this  fact,  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 and the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 \nidentify  private  sector  development  as  a  key  priority  for  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.10 Within this framework, ADB has been supporting economic reforms and private sector \ndevelopment  through  a  number  of  programs  focused  on  SOE  restructuring,  development  of \nmicrofinance, and financial sector reforms. Continued support and engagement in these sectors \nwill be essential to continuing progress in the SME sector. ADB loans have been processed as \nclusters to ensure a medium-term focus, while reforms have been consistently assisted through \nregular technical assistance.  \n \nB. \n \n14.  \nThe impact of subprogram 2 will be to increase the contribution of SMEs and the private \nsector  in  achieving  sustainable  high  economic  growth.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved \nbusiness environment to support more competitive SMEs and the private sector. Subprogram 2 \nincludes 32 reform actions (11 policy triggers and 21 milestones) that the government completed \nfrom 2010 to 2013. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nSubprogram  2  is  structured  around  four  major  outputs  covering  key  areas  of  reform: \n(i) enhancing  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  (ii)  improving  the \nin  support  of  SME  development  and  operations,  \nefficiency  of  administrative  systems \n(iii)  strengthening  the  regulatory  framework  for  competition  policy,  and  (iv)  enhancing  SME \naccess  to  finance.  The  reform  actions  defined  for  subprogram  2  are  drawn  from  strategic \nplanning documents including the SEDP, 2011\u20132015, and have been widely discussed with the \ngovernment  agencies  and  other  relevant  stakeholders.  In  addition  to  the  policy  triggers  agreed \nfor subprogram 2, progress has been achieved in areas initially not covered in the policy matrix \nbut of critical importance for SME development. These include progress on the  simplification of \nadministrative  procedures,  measures  aimed  at  reducing  tax  compliance  costs  of  SMEs,  and \npreparation  of  the  first  draft  of  the  amendments  to  the  Enterprise  Law,  2005.  In  addition, \nprogress toward amendment of the Competition Law is reflected in the policy matrix.  \n \n\nOutputs \n\nEnhancing the Policy and Planning Framework for SME Development \n\n1. \n \n16. \nThe government, through the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), has continued to \nimprove  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  while  furthering  the \nmainstreaming  of  gender  issues.  The  government  issued  the  SEDP,  2011\u20132015  and  launched \nspecific  programs  to  support  the  development  of  female  entrepreneurs\u2019  skills.  The  government \nconducted  regular  consultations  during  the  formulation  of  subprogram  2  with  a  wide  range  of \nstakeholders,  including  representatives  from  women  entrepreneurs.  The  government  has  also \nimproved the statistical base for SME policy formulation and  now publishes size-disaggregated \ndata on SMEs, as well as SME sex-disaggregated data by relevant categories. \n\n                                                \n9   ADB.  2004.

It has established the Administrative Procedures \nControl  Agency  (APCA)  as  a  permanent  agency  under  Decision  74/2010  with  a  mandate  to \nreview, simplify, and ensure consistency within the  administrative procedures of all government \nagencies  at  both  national  and  provincial  levels.  The  APCA  has  coordinated  with  the  relevant \nministries and government agencies to simplify administrative procedures affecting businesses at \nnational  and  provincial  levels.  As  a  result  of  these  sustained  efforts,  the  Prime  Minister  has \nratified 25 resolutions that will allow the simplification of 4,800 administrative procedures. Under \nthis initiative, 3,800 administrative procedures have already been simplified. Progress in this area \nhas  been  reflected  in  a  new  trigger  in  the  policy  matrix.  In  addition,  the  APCA  has  conducted \nRIAs of 2,800 of these 4,800 administrative procedures.  \n\n \n18. \nThe government has improved the efficiency of the national business registration system \nby intensifying efforts to build the capacity of provincial business registration offices. In addition, \nit has further simplified business registration procedures by establishing the legal validity of web-\nbased registrations, and streamlined the issuance of enterprise codes. These codes are unique \nto each business entity and are used for both business and tax purposes. \n\n \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance \n\n19.  With the  approval  of  the  Medium  Term  Plan  for  Customs  Modernization,  2011\u20132015  by \nthe  Prime  Minister,  the  government  continues  to  simplify  the  tax  and  customs  procedures \napplicable to SMEs, thereby reducing their compliance costs. The Customs General Department \nthe  \nunder \ne-customs  system  for  commercial  imports  and  exports.  The  implementation  of  e-filing  reduces \nthe time to file a customs declaration from up to a full day to just minutes. Important progress has \nalso been achieved in the simplification of the tax payment system for customs through Decision \n85/2011. This allows for speedy release of goods from customs via a pilot program wherein the \npayment  of  duties  is  coursed  through  commercial  banks  and  reported  to  the  Treasury \nDepartment by way of an enhanced information exchange system.  \n\nimplementation  of \n\nleading \n\n(MOF) \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n \nThe  government,  through  amendment  to  the  Law  on  Tax  Administration,  2006  has  also \n20. \nachieved a comparable reduction in tax compliance costs for SMEs by limiting the frequency of \nVAT declarations from a monthly to quarterly basis. This important progress has been reflected \nin a new trigger in the policy matrix.   \n\nStrengthening the Regulatory Framework for Competition Policy \n\n \n3. \n \n21. \nThe  government,  particularly  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  and  the  Central  Institute  for \nEconomic Management (CIEM), have strived to improve the quality of new legal documents and \nto extend legal protection to private businesses in the country. The MOJ has issued guidelines to \nconduct RIAs, with the aim of harmonizing practices across government agencies.  \n \nIn response to demands from SMEs to improve the access to and quality of legal services, \n22. \nthe  government  has  continued  to  implement  Decree  66/2008  to  ensure  that  the  rights  of \nenterprises to conduct business are protected. Program 585 on SME Access to Legal Services \nwas  approved  in  2010,  which  established  a  specialized  division  within  the  Civil  Economic \nLegislation  Department  of  the  MOJ.  The  SME  Legal  Services  Division  has  organized  an \nimportant  number  of  events  across  the  country  through  the  provincial  branches  of  the  MOJ  to \ndisseminate  laws  pertaining  to  SME  development.  Despite  its  financial  constraints,  the  division \nlegislation  with \nhas  been  able \n\ntable  discussions  on  business \n\nto  conduct  32  round \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n6,000 participating  SMEs;  and  50  training  courses  on  business  legislation,  training  some \n10,000 SME participants. The division, together with the staff of the provincial governments, has \nprovided training to 7,600 legal representatives of SMEs on contractual issues since its creation \nin 2010. About half of these participants are women. \n\n \n23. \nThe  government,  through  the  Viet  Nam  Competition  Authority  (VCA),  has  made \nsubstantial progress toward amendment of the Competition Law and its implementing regulations. \nThe  VCA  has  published the  5-year  Review  Report  on  Viet  Nam  Competition  Legislation,  which \ntogether with the results of an ongoing survey of 500 enterprises and professionals, will serve as \nthe  basis for the  proposed  amendments  to the  law.  The  policy  matrix  reflects  current  progress, \nas  well  as  the  need  to  address  the  RIA  for  the  amended  law  in  2014.  The  government  also \ncompleted drafting of the amendments to the Enterprise Law in February 2013, representing an \nimportant  new  trigger  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  amendments  to  the  law  incorporate  aspects  of \ngood  corporate  governance.  The  proposed  amended  law  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the \nNational Assembly in last quarter of 2013.  \n\n \nThe  government  has  completed  a  review  of  the  implementation  of  the  unemployment \n24. \ninsurance scheme, covering important aspects of the scheme that are applicable to SMEs. As a \nresult,  the  deadline  to  apply  for  unemployment  benefits  has  been  extended  and  expanded \nadvisory  services  are  provided  for  beneficiaries  actively  looking  for  jobs.  Recommendations \nunder  consideration  include  requests  to  extend  coverage  of  the  scheme  to  smaller  private \ncompanies (with  10  employees  or  less)  and for employees  with  contracts  beyond  3  months.  In \naddition,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  has  been  publishing  sex-\ndisaggregated labor market data through its annual Employment Trends publication and website, \ncontributing to efficient policy formulation that mainstreams gender dimensions. \n\n \n4. \n\nEnhancing SME Access to Finance \n\n \nThe government has taken initiatives to increase the availability of credit to SMEs through \n25. \nthe implementation of a number of reforms. A new draft decree on the activities of financing and \nleasing  companies  has  been  submitted  for  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  approval.  The  decree \nconsolidates earlier regulations to provide consistency with the recent Law on Credit Institutions. \nThe draft decree provides further clarity as to the liabilities and obligations of leasing companies \nand  client  enterprises.  In  addition,  the  government  has  identified  SMEs  as  a  priority  sector  for \ncredit  growth  in  2011\u20132013  and  has  issued  guidelines  to  provide  favorable  credit  terms  from \nfinancial institutions to SMEs. Training initiatives for financial institutions have been implemented \nto create specialized SME knowledge and thus facilitate access to finance. \n \n26. \nThe  government  has  revised  the  legal  framework  for  the  credit  guarantee  scheme, \nensuring a more balanced credit risk and collateral sharing with participating commercial banks. \nDecision  3/2011  establishes  a  maximum  guarantee  through  VDB  of  85%  of  the  total  project \ncapital.  \n \n27. \nThe development of sources of equity financing has progressed with the steady growth of \nthe  unlisted  public  companies  market  (UPCoM).  HNX  has  produced  an  assessment  of \nconstraints  to  UPCoM  development  and  a  series  of  recommendations  for  its  reform.  The \nproposal  has  been  submitted  to  the  State  Securities  Commission  and  will  effectively  replace \nDecision 108 on the organization and operations of the UPCoM.11  \n\n                                                \n11  The HNX report and assessment were assisted by the work conducted under  ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n(TA 7464-VIE). \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nSubprogram  2  successfully  concludes  a  medium-term  program  of  assistance  to  support \n28. \nSME  development  in  Viet  Nam.  The  maturity  of  the  sector  and  the  assessment  of  structural \nchallenges to private sector development  advise shifting, in terms of future direct ADB support, \nfrom policy-based loans to more targeted approaches that include both project and policy-based \nlending. Areas for continued policy dialogue include land reforms, SME access to legal services, \nand  public\u2013private  partnership  potential  for  SMEs.12  Further  success  in  private  sector \ndevelopment  in  Viet  Nam  will  largely  depend  on  progress  in  key  structural  reforms,  such  as \nfinancial  sector  or  SOE  reforms,  where  ADB  has  active  programs  of  assistance.  Sustained \nsupport to policy dialogue for SME development and specific project initiatives from development \npartners, including World Bank and JICA will continue to anchor reform efforts. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nSubprogram  2  is  estimated  to  cost  $50 million.  The  loan  size  is  based  on  the  financing \nneeds  of  Viet  Nam,  the  strength  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and  its  development  impact. \nViet Nam\u2019s gross financing needs remain high. In 2013, with a budget deficit target of 4.8%, the \ngovernment will need to borrow D162 trillion ($7.8 billion). In 2012, deficit financing was obtained \nfrom  domestic  sources  (44%)  and  external  sources  (56%),  of  which  about  84%  was  official \ndevelopment assistance. Assuming a similar distribution for 2013, the government will borrow an \nestimated  $3.7  billion  through  official  development  assistance  to  close  the  budget  gap.  A \nsummary  of  the  expected  costs  and  benefits  of  the  proposed  reforms  is  provided  in  para. 33, \nwhile  the  program  impact  assessment  provides  additional  details.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  debt  is \ncurrently  at  sustainable  levels.  The  present  value  of  government  and  government-guaranteed \nexternal debt is estimated at about 27% of GDP,13 which is lower than the 50% of GDP threshold \nof the International Monetary Fund for external debt sustainability. More than 80% of government \nand  government-guaranteed  external  debt  is  long-term  concessional  financing  obtained  from \nofficial creditors. \n \nto \n30. \nSDR33,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2.  The  loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.14 \n \nE. \n \n31. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. The MPI will be the executing \nagency  and  will  be  responsible for  the  overall  implementation of subprogram  2. The  Enterprise \nDevelopment Agency (EDA), MOF, MOJ, State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), Ministry of Industry and \nTrade (MOIT), Office of the Government (OOG), and MOLISA will be the implementing agencies \nand will all be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of subprogram 2. The EDA will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  and  monitoring  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  under \nsubprogram 2. The interministerial program steering committee established under subprogram 1, \nchaired  by  the  deputy  minister  or  a  designated  substitute  of  the  MPI,  and  comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  EDA,  MOF,  MOJ,  SBV,  MOIT,  OOG,  and  MOLISA,  will  meet \nsemiannually, and if needed, on an ad hoc basis to monitor progress of the program, in particular, \nthe  post-program  policy  partnership  framework;  and  to  provide  guidance  and  direction  to  the \n                                                \n12  All these areas are currently supported under ADB technical assistance (footnote 2).  \n13  Macroeconomic and Debt Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. 1998.

The  studies  include  the  governance  risk  assessment  prepared  for  the \nADB country partnership strategy, the World Bank\u2019s country gender assessment, and others. In \naddition,  the  program  impact  assessment  and  the  macroeconomic  and  debt  management \nassessment carried out for subprogram 2 are presented as supplementary documents.  \n\n \nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \nThe  impact  assessment  of  subprogram  2  estimates  that  the  policy  reforms  carried  out \n33. \nunder subprogram 2 add about $900 million to the economy, equivalent to 0.6% of GDP.15 The \nbenefits  arise  from  improved  allocative  and  operational  efficiencies  at  the  regional  government \nlevel.  These  include  the  simplification  of  administrative  procedures  ,  the  reduction  in  tax \ncompliance costs from reductions in the frequency of VAT declarations, and the simplification of \ncustoms  and  tax  payment  procedures.  The  costs  of  the  policy  reforms  in  terms  of  government \nadministrative costs and fiscal costs of implementing such reforms amount to about $465 million, \nor  0.3%  of  GDP.  The  costs  include  implementation  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  implementation  of  the  Medium-Term  Plan  for  Customs \nModernization,  and  the  cost  of  establishment  of  the  forthcoming  SME  Development  Fund.  The \nreforms articulated in Subprogram 2 are expected to provide a net benefit to the economy.  \n \nB. \n \n34. \nprogress  is  being  made  in  improving  macro-fiscal  discipline,  strategic  allocation  of  resources, \nand efficiency of service delivery. In spite of good tax collection ratios (about 26% of GDP), the \ndetermination of actual budget deficits is compromised by  the application of standards different \nfrom  the  Global  Financial  Statistics  in  the  government\u2019s  official  accounts.  Further  efficiency  of \nbudgetary  allocations  (and  on  service  delivery)  requires  better  linkages  between  medium-term \n                                                \n15 Summary  Program  Impact  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The \nmethodology used   assists in minimizing adjustment costs from reforms, justifying the proposed regulatory reforms \non the basis of the expected net benefits.  \n\nThe government\u2019s public financial management reforms are at an early stage but steady \n\n Governance \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nplanning  and  budgeting  and  between  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The  government  is \nreviewing  the  2002  Budget  Law  to  deepen  implementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework and performance-based budgeting, and to improve budget execution, monitoring, and \nimplementation.  The  treasury  and  budget  management  information  system  is  strengthening \ngovernment  budget  reporting  and  accounting.  Tax  management  and  customs  modernization \nreforms  are  under  way,  increasing  the  transparency  of  administrative  procedures  and  reducing \ncompliance costs for  taxpayers. The government  has  approved the  National  External  Debt  and \nPublic  Debt  Strategy,  2011\u20132020.  As  a  result,  aggregate  public  debt  information  has  been \npublished recently for the first time. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the MPI. The government is taking concrete \nsteps to battle corruption and has adopted several legal reforms, including implementation of the \nAnti-Corruption Law, 2005. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nfor \n\nthrough \n\nits  support \n\nto  poverty  reduction \n\nSubprogram  2  will  contribute \n\nC. \n \n35. \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s  SEDP,  2011\u20132015,  which  (i)  specifies  support  for  the  development  of  SMEs  in \nremote  and  socioeconomically  disadvantaged  areas;  (ii)  prioritizes  SMEs  owned  by  ethnic \nminorities  and  women;  and  (iii)  targets  350,000  new  SMEs  to  be  established,  generating \n3.5\u20134.0  million  new  jobs  during  the  same  period,  some  of  which  will  be  in  the  disadvantaged \nareas.  The  policy  reforms  proposed  will  strengthen  the  regulatory  business  environment  and \nreduce  the  administrative  costs  of  doing  business,  making  it  easier  for  enterprises  to  enter  the \nmarket  and  become  more competitive.  SME  development  has the greatest  impact  on  new  jobs \ncreation, raising incomes and making more resources available for social protection.16  \n \n36.   Subprogram 2 has been categorized \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d  It will strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  SME  policy  making,  leading  to  the  development  of  gender-\nresponsive policy and regulations to support the development of  women entrepreneurs and the \ngrowth  of  SMEs  owned  by  women.  Subprogram  2  will  facilitate  the  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  on  SMEs,  and  will  increase  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  access  to  credit  and \nfinancial  services.  The  policies  supported  by  subprogram  2  have  identified  specific  targets, \nincluding an increase in the amount of women entrepreneurs to 26% by 2013 and 35% by 2020, \nand  an  explicit  commitment  to  collect  SME  composition  data  that  is  sex-disaggregated.  The \nSEDP,  2011\u20132015  includes  provisions  for  specific  programs  to  upgrade  the  capacity  of  SMEs \nowned by women and to provide access to credit to 286,000 women entrepreneurs. The SEDP \nalso calls for the provision of training to women provincial registrars covering the new business \nregistration system, and directs the General Statistics Office to publish data on women directors \nand firm owners disaggregated by enterprise, ethnicity, age group, and education level. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n \n38.
