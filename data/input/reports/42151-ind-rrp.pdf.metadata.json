An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix \nwas  undertaken  and  no  potential  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected. \n \nRapid economic growth in India has led to a marked decrease in \npoverty  incidence  from  36%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  1994  to  27.5%  in \nFY2005.  Nevertheless,  in  absolute  numbers,  India  still  has  302 \nmillion  poor;  73%  or  nearly  220  million  of  the  poor  live  in  rural \nareas.  The  growing  rural\u2013urban  divide  is  reflected  in  sharp \ndisparity  in  per  capita  income.  In  addition,  gender  inequalities  in \nterms  of  nutrition,  health,  education,  work  burden,  and \npowerlessness  persist.  While  over  70%  of  the  Indian  population \nresides  in  rural  India  and  56%  draw  their  sustenance  from \nagriculture,  agricultural  productivity  has  been  decelerating.  As  a \nresult,  the  agriculture  sector  is  unable  to  absorb  the  large  rural \nwork force even at subsistence levels.  \n \nWith an overarching focus on inclusive growth, the 11th Five Year \nPlan  (FY2007\u2013FY2011)  seeks  to  increase  employment  by  58 \nmillion, mostly in the rural nonfarm sector (RNFS). Growth of real \nper  capita  nonagricultural  output  through  the  promotion  of  the \nRNFS  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  rural  poverty. \nThe  RNFS  has  immense  potential  to  generate  new  jobs  with \nrelatively  low  direct  investments,  by  utilizing  local  skills  and \nresources  or  by  meeting  local  demands  by  adopting  simple \ntechnology.  About  90  million  people  representing  about  18%  of \nthe total workforce are estimated to be engaged in the RNFS. \n \nKhadi  and  village \nindustries  (KVI),  originally  promoted  by \nMahatma Gandhi in 1920s for rural self employment, are integral \nto the RNFS and identified by the 11th Five Year Plan as one of \nthe  subsectors  with  significant  prospects \nfor  employment. \nCurrently,  KVI  subsector  accounts  for  nearly  9  million  of  total \nRNFS  employment.  Khadi,  a  handspun  and  handwoven  cloth,  is \nthe single largest component of KVI subsector. The production of \nkhadi  is  organized  by  nongovernment  organizations  known  as \nkhadi  institutions  through  artisans  (spinners  and  weavers).  Khadi \nis  marketed  by  the  outlets  of  khadi  institutions  through  out  the \ncountry. At the apex, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission \n(KVIC)  provides  policy,  technical,  and  marketing  support.  The \nGovernment  extends  financial  support  through  subsidies  to \npromote khadi. \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\nPolicy Framework and \nProgram Components \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\ninclude \n\ntextile  market \n\n \nNotwithstanding the recognition of khadi in India and the large and \ndiverse potential market that the country provides, khadi sales has \nnearly  stagnated  even  when \nis  making \nremarkable  progress.  Production  and  marketing  inefficiencies  left \nunattended  for  decades  have  isolated  khadi  from  changing \nconsumer  preferences.  The  constraints \n(i)  ageing \nequipment  and  inconsistent  product  quality;  (ii)  khadi  institutions \nare  fragmented  and  dispersed;  and  lack  professional  expertise, \nfinancial  means,  and  unified  vision  to  adjust  to  changing  market \ntrends;  (iii)  marketing  and  sales  are  primarily  through  7,050 \nundifferentiated  and  dilapidated  outlets  of  khadi  institutions  that \nare  isolated  from  current  marketing  trends  in  terms  of  products \ndesign  and  service  quality;  and  (iv)  incentive  structures  through \nsubsidies  for  production  and  marketing  have  impeded  reforms \nmeant to anchor khadi to changing consumer preferences.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  Khadi  Reform  and  Development \nProgram \nincome  and \nemployment  growth  for  the  RNFS.  The  Program  outcome  is \nrevitalization of the KVI subsector with enhanced sustainability of \nkhadi, increased employment generation and incomes, increased \nartisan  welfare,  and  development  of  select  traditional  village \nindustries.  The  reform  of  production  and  marketing  of  khadi  will \nlead  to  sustainable  employment  opportunities  at  low  per  capita \ninvestment.  In  addition  to  reduction  in  income  poverty,  the \nProgram  will  also  reduce  nonincome  poverty.  Khadi \nis  a \ngeographically  widespread  economic  activity  encompassing  all \nstates  and  regions  in  the  country.  Given  the  high  involvement  of \nwomen,  and  marginalized  groups  in  the  KVI  subsector,  its \ndevelopment  will  promote  inclusive  growth.  Reforms  of  khadi  will \nhelp facilitate KVI subsector wide reforms.  \n  \nThe  Program  comprises \nsustainability of khadi  \n \n(i) \n\nis  enhancement  of \n\nfollowing  measures \n\n(the  Program) \n\nfor  ensuring \n\nfor \n\nreform  package \n\nestablishing a policy reform and implementation framework \nincluding  a  comprehensive \nthe \ndevelopment of khadi; \npromoting  and  marketing  khadi  by  establishing  a  \u201ckhadi \nmark\u201d, and a marketing organization majority owned by the \nprivate sector; \nrealizing  procurement  and  production  efficiencies  by \n facilitating  raw  material  production  and  procurement, \n introducing  market-linked  pricing,  rationalizing  financial \nassistance for khadi, and encouraging khadi entrepreneurs \nand empowering artisans; and \nimplementing  institutional  reforms,  including  restructuring \nKVIC  to  enhance  its  development  role,  revitalizing  khadi \ninstitutions,  building  capacity,  and  developing  synergies \nwith village industries. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching  \n\nA loan of $150,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  an \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe loan will be released in four tranches to be implemented over \n3  years.  The  first  tranche  of  $20  million  will  be  released  upon \ncompliance  with  the  first  tranche  release  conditions,  expected  to \noccur at loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $40 million is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  8  months  of  the  first  tranche,  the \nthird  tranche  of  $40  million  within  13  months  of  the  second \ntranche, and the fourth tranche of $50 million within 15 months of \nthe third tranche. Each release will be subject to compliance with \nthe respective tranche release conditions.   \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency, and KVIC the Implementing Agency. A reform \nimplementation  division  will  be  set  up  at  KVIC.  The  state  and \ndivisional offices of KVIC will establish reform  management units \nto support institutional reform. The reform implementation division \nwill be responsible for coordinating actions under the Program and \nmonitoring  the  overall  progress.  A  reform  implementation  and \nmonitoring committee at the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises will serve as the program steering committee.  \n \nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan in the amount of $2,000,000 \nis  attached  to  the  Program.  The  goal  of  the  TA  titled  Capacity \nBuilding for Reforming Khadi and Village Industry Subsector is to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  khadi  reform  package  and  its \nobjective  is  to  expedite  commencement  of  the  reforms.  The \npurpose of the TA is to strengthen implementation and monitoring \nof  the  khadi  reform  package  to  revitalize  khadi  as  a  source  of \nrobust nonfarm livelihoods for many rural poor.  \n \nThe  Program  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing \nissues and socially significant  measures to enhance employment \nfor  the  poor  and  marginalized.  Comprehensive  reforms  seek  to \nincrease the involvement of private entrepreneurs by enabling the \nuse  of  khadi  mark,  phasing  out  subsidies,  and  ensuring \nprofessionalism  in  marketing.  Removing  restrictions  on  product \npricing will improve links between production and marketing.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nThe  reform  of  khadi  institutions,  the  primary  producers,  will \n \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nenhance  quality,  design,  and  artisan  income.  Nearly  half  of  the \nprogram  resources  are  directed  to  supporting  khadi  institutions. \nThe  institutional  reforms  at  KVIC  will  strengthen  its  development \nrole.  Minimizing  raw  material  production  and  marketing  activities \n\nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n\fin \n\nimpacts \n\nthose  with \n\nin  reducing  rural\u2013urban  migration \n\nof  KVIC  will  allow  greater  private  sector  participation  in  the \nproduction and marketing of khadi.  \n \nAt  the  macro  level,  the  Program  supports  poverty  reduction  by \nenhancing  employment  and  incomes,  and  thus  contributing  to \nstability  and  peace  in  rural  areas.  KVI  subsector  provides \nemployment  opportunities  to  the  rural  poor  including  in  remote \nand hilly areas. The poverty impact will be widespread and cover \nthe  country\u2019s  poorest  states,  and \nlow  human \ndevelopment  and  social  indicators,  as  khadi  production  and \nmarketing  encompass  the  entire  country.  The  Program  will  have \npositive \nterms  of  reducing  nonincome  poverty. \nIncreases  in  household  incomes  will  lead  to  a  change  in \nexpenditure patterns in favor of nonmaterial consumption, such as \neducation and health. The impact of khadi on rural development, \nand \nis  also  significant. \nDevelopment  of  khadi  will  therefore  promote  inclusive  growth, \ninvolving  women,  and  socially  and  geographically  marginalized \ngroups.  The  Program  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on \nindigenous peoples. \n \nAnchored  in  an  overall  strategy  of  inclusive  growth,  the  Program \nwill  enhance  artisans\u2019  employment  and  earnings \nthrough \nproduction,  marketing,  and  governance \nfor  khadi \ninstitutions. Governance reforms ensure artisan representation on \nboards  of  directors  of  khadi  institutions  to  empower  artisans  by \ninvolving  them  in  decisions  relating  to  wages  and  distribution  of \nsurplus. The licensing conditions for the use of a khadi mark and \nthe removal of restrictions on pricing of products will help provide \nhigher  wages \nfor  artisans.  Production  of  khadi  by  new \nentrepreneurs  encouraged  by  conducive  policies  established \nunder the Program will generate further employment. \n \n\nreforms \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  While  overall  commitment  to  the  reforms  is  strong,  the  extensive \nreform  hierarchy  involving  stakeholders  all  the  way  down  to \ngrassroots  level  could  slow  the  pace  of  reform.  This  risk  is  dealt \nwith,  in  part,  by  front  loading  the  conditions  relating  to  the  policy \nreform  and  implementation  framework,  as  well  as  up-front  legal \nassurances.  In  addition,  program  support  is  based  on  defined \ncriteria. Continuity of support will require achievement of specified \nkey results.  \n \nThe  implementation  risk  due  to  inadequate  skills  is  being \nminimized \nfor  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \nStaff  at  KVIC  and  khadi  institutions,  and  artisans  could  resist \ninstitutional  and  governance \nthereby  undermining \nexpected performance improvements. Factors that mitigate these \nrisks include (i) up-front commitment to the khadi reform package; \n(ii)  redefinition  of  role  and  vision  of  KVIC  and  khadi  institutions; \nand (iii) significant investments in human resource development. \n\nthrough  adequate \n\ntechnical  support \n\nreforms, \n\n \n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe private sector\u2019s confidence to invest and associate with khadi \ndepends  on  whether  the  Government  and  KVIC  can  produce \nsuccessful outcomes as a result of the reforms. Any redirection of \nthe  reform  policies  might  cause  the  private  sector  to  lose \nconfidence. The measures under the Program to improve investor \nconfidence  include  (i)  up-front  policy  decision  to  commit  to  the \nreform  agenda,  and  (ii)  rigorous  monitoring  of  implementation  to \nmeet performance benchmarks.  \n \nWhile  the  Program  has  benefited  from  successful  practices,  the \npossibility  that  final  products  may,  at  least  initially,  not  find  a \npositive  market  response  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In  this  event,  the \nreasons  will  have  to  be  analyzed  and  appropriately  addressed. \nThe  Government  also  anticipates  that  adjusting  to  new  business \nprocesses  and  market  expectations  could  take  time.  As  a  result, \nthe Program is designed as a pilot and all actions are phased. In \naddition, support to each selected khadi institution will be spread \nover  time  to  enable  engagement  throughout  the  adjustment \nprocess. \n\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to India for the Khadi Reform and Development Program (the Program), and (ii) proposed \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reforming  the  Khadi  and  Village \nIndustry Subsector. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nThe Indian economy grew by an annual average of 7.8% during fiscal year (FY) 2002\u2013\n2007;  9.6%  in  FY2006  and  9%  in  FY2007.  Accompanying  the  high  growth  rates,  poverty \nincidence  decreased  markedly  from  36%  in  FY1994  to  27.5%  in  FY2005. 1 Nevertheless,  in \nabsolute numbers, India still has nearly 302 million poor people. Regional disparities in poverty \nand  social  indicators  persist.  The  rural\u2013urban  divide  is  reflected  in  several  development \nindicators including per capita income; and access to education, health care, drinking water, and \nsanitation. Nearly 73% or 220 million of India\u2019s poor live in rural areas.  \n \n3. \nGrowth has not necessarily led to positive gender outcomes. Maternal deaths accounted \nfor 15% of deaths of women of reproductive age, and literacy among women was 54.2% versus \n75.9% for males.2 Labor force participation rates for women were 22.7%, compared with 51.6% \nfor  men.  Gender  inequalities  in  terms  of  nutrition,  health,  education,  and  work  burden  persist. \nIndia\u2019s performance on the Millennium Development Goals3 indicates that the country is lagging \nin gender parity in education, infant mortality, and maternal mortality rates.  \n \nThe  Government  therefore  has  made  inclusive  growth  a  policy  priority.  The  11th  Five \n4. \nYear  Plan 4  for  FY2007\u2013FY2011  (11th  FYP)  aims  to  bridge  the  various  divides\u2014including \neconomic, social, geographic, and human resources\u2014by providing opportunities for increasing \nincomes  and  employment,  and  including  specific  programs  to  cover  the  marginalized  and \nvulnerable to ensure that growth is more broad based and inclusive. With its overarching focus \non inclusive growth, the 11th FYP seeks to increase employment by 58 million. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR  \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nThe Rural Nonfarm Sector  \n\n5. \nAgriculture  and  allied  activities  contributed  only  18%  to  the  overall  gross  domestic \nproduct of India in FY2007, even though more than 70% of the Indian population resides in rural \nareas  and  56%  draw  their  sustenance  from  agriculture.  During  FY1977\u2013FY1999,  growth  in \nagriculture  employment  averaged  just  1%. 5  The  low  productivity  of  agriculture  stems  from \nseveral  factors,  including  (i)  slow  progress  with  land  reform,  (ii)  inadequate  rural  finance  and \nmarketing services for farm produce, (iii) small landholdings that are subject to fragmentation,6 \n                                                 \n1   Press Information Bureau.

United Kingdom. \n\n6   Of the nearly 120 million farm holdings, roughly 60% are less than 1 hectare; another 20% are only 1\u20132 hectares. \n\nAbout one-third of operating farms constitute tenant farmers, most of whom are poor.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv)  slow  adoption  of  modern  agricultural  practices  and  technologies,  and  (v)  inadequate \nirrigation infrastructure resulting in high dependence on rain-fed agriculture.  \n \nThe  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNFS) 7  is  critical  for  providing  alternative  livelihoods  by \n6. \ndiversifying  income  sources  of  the  rural  population  when  the  agriculture  sector  cannot  absorb \nthe rural work force in any significant number. Growth of real per capita nonagricultural output \nthrough  promotion  of  the  RNFS  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  reducing  rural  poverty.  The \nRNFS  has  immense  potential  to  generate  new  jobs  with  relatively  low  direct  investments  by \nutilizing local skills and resources or by meeting local demands by adopting simple technology.  \n \n7. \nThe  RNFS  engages  an  estimated  90  million  people,  18%  of  the  total  workforce  and \n20%\u201325% of the rural workforce. Employment generation in the RNFS during FY2000\u2013FY2005 \nwas nearly double the overall employment growth. The sector contributes from 25% to 35% of \nthe total income of rural households. Within the RNFS, traditional subsectors8 account for nearly \n80% of employment. Nevertheless, the traditional subsectors are in relative decline especially in \nterms  of  value  of  outputs.  Nontraditional  subsectors  that  are  capital  intensive  and  utilize \nadvanced  technologies  are  growing  and  contributing  significantly  to  the  export  market.  This \nbroadly reflects a structural change away from agriculture toward the RNFS.  \n \n8. \nRNFS growth is, in large part, a result of private enterprise to ensure livelihood security. \nThe  key  agencies  engaged  in  implementing  RNFS  programs  are  described  in  Appendix  2, \nFigure  A2.  While  central  and  state  governments  have  extensively  promoted  the  sector,  the \npotential  of  the  RNFS  continues  to  be  affected  by  (i)  inadequate  coordination  and  follow-up \nmechanisms over the  multiplicity of schemes and agencies; (ii) lack of appropriate policies for \ndeveloping RNFS capacity to adjust and modernize in response to conditions brought about by \nglobalization, \nconsumer  preferences;  and  \n(iii)  inadequate  social  and  physical  infrastructure  to  ensure  conditions  for  broad-based  growth \nand  good  investment  opportunities.  In  addition,  growth  and  surpluses  in  the  agriculture  sector \nhave not been sufficient to stimulate RNFS production and consumption linkages.  \n  \n\ncompetition,  and \n\nincreasing \n\nchanging \n\n2. \n\nKhadi and Village Industries Subsector  \n\nKhadi and village industries (KVI), originally promoted by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920s for \n9. \nrural  self  employment,  form  a  significant  subsector  of  the  RNFS  (Appendix  2).  The  11th  FYP \nidentifies the KVI subsector as having significant prospects for employment, primarily because it \nprovides employment to women, minorities, and the socioeconomically marginalized.  \n \n\nKhadi is handspun and handwoven cloth. The raw materials (cotton, silk, or wool) \nare  spun  and  woven  on  hand-spinning  wheels  called  charkha  and  woven  on \nhandlooms. \n\nA  village  industry  is  based  on  know-how  and  skills  of  artisans  and  rural  raw \nmaterials  and/or  markets\u2014pottery,  black  smithing,  handmade  leather  goods, \ncarpentry,  various  processed  foods  and  condiments,  cane  and  bamboo  craft, \ngoods made from various plant fibers, among others. \n\n                                                 \n7  The  RNFS  encompasses  all  nonagricultural  activities:  mining  and  quarrying,  household  and  nonhousehold \nmanufacturing, processing, repair, construction, trade and commerce, transport, and other services in villages and \nrural towns undertaken by enterprises varying in size from household enterprises to factories.  \n\n8  The  traditional  sectors  are  essentially  labor  intensive;  employ  the  poor  and  marginalized,  especially  women;  and \n\nemploy handcraft skills with simple technology.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nAn extensive institutional network promotes the KVI subsector (Table 1). The Khadi and \n10. \nVillage  Industries  Commission  (KVIC),  under  administrative  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Micro, \nSmall and Medium Enterprises (MMSME), is the national governing body. The state khadi and \nvillage  industries  boards  (KVIB)  also  support  the  KVI  subsector.  Financial  institutions  provide \ncredit for the subsector. In addition, multiple government and quasi government agencies also \nimplement projects that support the KVI subsector. 9 \n \n11.   As the apex agency, KVIC\u2019s initiatives for the KVI subsector10 can broadly be classified \nas:  \n\n  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nkhadi  programs,  including  raw  material  procurement,  marketing,  cost  chart, \nfinancial assistance in the form of rebates, and interest rate subsidies;  \nvillage  industries  programs,  including  the  Rural  Industry  Service  Center,  which \nsupports  upgrading  of  production  capacity,  market  promotion,  and  skills \ndevelopment;  and  the  Rural  Employment  Generation  Programme, 11  which \nprovides margin money subsidy for setting up an enterprise in rural areas with a \npopulation less than 20,000; and \nprograms for both khadi and village industries, including the Scheme of Funding \nfor  Regeneration  of  Traditional \nintegrated \ndevelopment of traditional khadi, coir, and village industries, including leather and \npottery;  research  and  development;  training;    and  the  Product  Development \nDesign  Intervention  and  Packaging  Scheme,  which  is  to  improve  quality  and \ndevelop new product lines.  \n\nIndustries,  which  supports \n\n \n12.   KVIC and the KVIBs implement these programs through the khadi institutions, registered \nwith  KVIC  or  the  KVIBs  as  well  as  through  independent  entrepreneurs.  Khadi  institutions  are \nmostly nongovernment organizations (NGO) formed either under the Societies Registration Act \n(1860), Charitable Trusts registered under Indian Trust Act, 1882, Section 25 of the Companies \nAct, 1956 or State Cooperative Societies Acts. The Government provided Rs6.61 billion to KVIC \nfor  administrative  expenses  and  promotion  of  the  KVI  subsector  in  FY2006.  KVIC  provides \nfunds for the KVIBs to implement various KVIC programs (para. 11). The KVIBs\u2019 administrative \nexpenses are met by the state governments.  \n \n13.  \nThe  KVI  production  and  sales  grew  by  13.3%  and  15.0%,  respectively  during  FY2006. \nOverall  sales  of  KVI  goods  stood  at  Rs176  billion  and  production  at  Rs140  billion  in  FY2006. \nVillage industries are responsible for nearly 90% of the sales and production. Currently, the KVI \nsubsector accounts for nearly 9 million of total RNFS employment. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  These include district rural development agencies, district industries centers, Council for Advancement of People\u2019s \nAction and Rural Technology, Handicraft Development Corporation, Minor Forest Products Corporation, Women\u2019s \nDevelopment  Corporation,  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  and  Small  Industries \nDevelopment Bank of India.   \n\n10 This document only refers to the programs of the KVIC implemented by KVIC and the KVIBs for which Government \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nsupport  is  available.

Within the KVI subsector, khadi \nis considered to have the most potential for inclusive development due to its marked emphasis \non gender, minorities, and other socioeconomically marginalized people, as well as community-\nbased processes. At the bottom of the pyramid of the khadi process are the spinners, weavers, \nand other artisans, such as skilled embroiders, (collectively referred to as artisans) employed or \nengaged by khadi institutions. KVIC has 1,252 affiliated khadi institutions and KVIB 700. Khadi \ninstitutions  are  engaged  in  production\u2014hand  spinning  of  cotton  sliver,  silk,  and/of  wool;  hand \nreeling silk into yarn; handloom weaving yarn into fabric; processing for finishing; and garment \nmaking\u2014and  retailing  of  khadi  products.  A  few  khadi  institutions  are  integrated  into  the \nproduction of raw materials (sliver or threads) from cotton. Of the 1,952 khadi institutions, only \n64  are  exclusively  trading  institutions;  all  others  are  engaged  in  producing  and  retailing  khadi. \nThe khadi production process for cotton is described in Table 2. The processes for wool and silk \nare similar. Khadi is also woven with polyester and marketed as polyvastra.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \nProduction \nCotton \nbales \nSliver  \n\nYarn \n\nFabric  \n\nProducers \n\nFarm \nhouseholds  \nSliver plants: \nKVIC (6), sliver \nplants of khadi \ninstitutions and \nother \nenterprises  \nSpinners, \nmostly poor \nwomen  \n \n\nWeavers, \nmostly poor \nmen  \n\nGarments \n\nKhadi \ninstitutions  \n\n5\n\nTable 2: Khadi Production Process \n\nProcess \n\nFarm produce  \n\nCotton bale is used to produce \ncotton tapes, which is then \nused to produce sliver, a loose \nsoft untwisted strand of textile \nfiber produced by a carding or \ncombing machine \nThe sliver is traded by khadi \ninstitutions to spinners who \nconvert the sliver into yarn on \nhand-powered spinning \nequipment (charkas).  \nThe yarn is traded by khadi \ninstitutions to weavers who \nweave the fabric on handlooms \nand sell it back to the khadi \ninstitutions in return for \nconversion charges  \n\nThe fabrics are processed (e.g., \ndyed) and converted into \ngarments using mechanized \nmeans for preset designs, \ndeveloped as customized \ngarments, or embellished with \nvalue additions, e.g., \nembroidered by skilled artisans  \n\nMarket / Marketing \nSliver (or cotton threads on \nspindles) plants  \nKhadi institutions  \n\nKhadi institutions buy back the yarn \nfrom the spinners on payment of \nconversion charges  \n\nFabrics are sold as processed cloth, \na more refined product than yarn, \neither directly to the end consumer \nthrough khadi institutions own retail \noutlets, traded with other khadi \ninstitutions, or through direct sales \noutlets of KVIC \nThe garment is sold by the khadi \ninstitutions either directly to the end \nconsumers through khadi \ninstitutions own retail outlets, traded \nwith other khadi institutions, or sold \ndirectly through KVIC outlets  \n\nKVIC = Khadi and Village Industries Commission. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.               \n \n15. \nKhadi production and marketing is supported by KVIC through sales rebate and interest \nrate subsidy. Khadi institutions undertake annual production planning based on KVIC specified \ncost  chart  that  includes  cost  elements  and  sales  price  for  each  khadi  product.12 Thereafter, \nKVIC certifies the khadi institution as eligible for the following.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nA sales rebate of about 20% of the sale value of khadi (and polyvastra) products \nis  provided  for  making  khadi  price  competitive.  The  sales  rebate  goes  to \nconsumers  and  is  claimed  by  khadi  institutions  from  KVIC.  The  sales  rebate  is \nproposed to be replaced in 2009 by market development assistance.13 \n\n                                                 \n12 Cost chart spells out the costs and conversion ratios at each stage of processing of khadi and includes (i) cost of \nraw materials and conversion charges (cotton to sliver); (ii) payments to spinners and weavers by khadi institutions \ni.e., conversion charges from sliver to yarn and yarn to fabric; (iii) payment to be made to finishers for processing \ncharges; (iv) amount to be apportioned towards establishment cost of khadi institutions (including gross margins); \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n(v)  amount  to  be  set  aside  for  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  cost  of  insurance,  and  (vi)  amount  earmarked  for \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nartisans\u2019 welfare fund. \n13 Khadi institutions would receive market development assistance of about 20% of cost of production, to be utilized \nfor  promoting  sales,  developing  new  designs,  market  promotion,  renting,  buying  or  modernizing  sales  outlets, \ntraining, and research and development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nInterest Rate Subsidy. The requirement of working capital by a khadi institution \nis  calculated  on  the  basis  of  production  cost.  KVIC  issues  an  interest  subsidy \neligibility certificate to khadi institutions to enable them to access bank financing \nat subsidized interest rates. KVIC pays the difference between the market-based \ninterest rates charged by banks and the interest rate paid by the khadi institution.  \n\n \n16. \nKVI subsector data and especially for khadi are difficult to obtain because of the largely \ninformal organization of production. Information available for KVIC khadi program suggests that \nkhadi provides rural employment in hand spinning (cotton, wool, and silk), hand reeling of silk, \nhandloom weaving, processing of fabric, and garment making. Semiskilled (principally spinners) \nand  skilled  (principally  weavers)  artisans  constitute  majority  of  the  khadi  production  workforce \nunder KVIC khadi program of nearly 1 million dispersed across the country.14 Of these, spinning \nprovides employment to 79%, followed by weaving and fabric processing 12%, and others 9%. \nAlmost  80%  of  spinners  are  women.  Others  or  nonartisans,  include  employees  of  khadi \ninstitutions  such  as  secretaries,  sales  and  administrative  personnel,  and  staff.  The  high \nparticipation  of  women  is  an  affirmation  that  spinning  is  a  subsidiary  activity  and  sought  by \npeople  less  able  to  migrate  in  search  of  work  or  less  able  to  work  outdoors  due  to  social \ncustoms. \n \n17. \nArtisan earnings from conversion charges are less than satisfactory. The average annual \nincome in FY2006 was Rs2,555 for cotton, Rs3,143 for wool, and Rs8,141 for silk. The income \nfrom  cotton  and  wool  are  less  than  the  official  poverty  line  of  Rs4,275  for  rural  areas.  The \nincome earned by each category of work is (i) spinners: Rs822 for cotton, Rs1,070 for wool, and \nRs3,035 for silk; (ii) weavers: Rs7,380 for cotton, Rs7,665 for wool, Rs12,141 for silk; and (iii) \nothers: Rs13,932 for cotton, Rs15,091 for wool, and Rs23,380 for silk. The earnings of spinners \nacross the product categories are much lower than the earnings of weavers and others. Cotton \nspinners, in particular, earn only Rs822 a year on average, or less than Rs69 a month for khadi \nspinning. Interactions with spinners indicate that the daily incomes for cotton khadi hover around \nRs30  to  Rs40.15 Assuming  a  wage  rate  of  Rs30/day,  the  full-time  employment  days  of  cotton \nspinners work out to 27.4 days, which is less than 1 month a year.  \n \n18. \nPrecisely assessing the current market for khadi is difficult since machine-made textiles \nare  also  being  sold  as  khadi.  The  widely  dispersed  informal  production  even  for  KVIC  khadi \nprogram makes data collation difficult. Available data indicate that production of khadi under the \nKVIC  khadi  program,  sold  through  7,050  khadi  institution  outlets  and  11  KVIC  direct  sales \noutlets, grew on an average by 2% in volume and 3% in value annually during FY2002\u2013FY2006. \nIn FY2006, khadi production grew by 4.9% and sales by 5.5% compared to the previous year. \nThese figures do not include handspun and woven khadi sold by private enterprises for which \ndata is not available. Nearly two thirds of the market is for cotton khadi.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 The states with a significant number of khadi artisans are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, \n\nPunjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.  \n\n15 While local wages in rural areas vary widely across regions and during the year, the peak rate during the farming \nseason is around Rs30 even in the poorest regions. Although the minimum wage varies across states, the average \nminimum daily wage is around Rs70. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues  \n\nKhadi  is  estimated  to  constitute  less  than  1%  of  India\u2019s  textile  market.  The  growth  in \n19. \nproduction and sales of khadi (para.18) is marginal compared to the increase in the production \nof  textiles  at  a  compound  growth  rate  of  7%  in  volume  and  15%  in  value  during  FY2002\u2013\nFY2006.  The  textile  industry  has  made  tremendous  strides  with  the  adoption  of  modern \ntechnology,  branding,  and  savvy  marketing.  In  contrast,  khadi  has  been  unable  to  adapt  to \neconomic  and  technological  advancements.  As  a  result,  the  community-based  production  and \nmarketing  model  of  a  product  that  is  still  revered,  is  neither  able  to  gain  market  share  nor \nsubstantially contribute to rural employment. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Weak Links in the Value Chain. Khadi production and marketing under the KVIC khadi \nprogram are constrained by the following:  \n\nRaw  Materials.  The  absence  of  proper  quality  control  protocol  and  equipment \nleads to variable raw material quality that affects the quality of the final product.  \nEquipment.  With  aging  equipment  and  raw  material  quality  constraints,  khadi \nproduction cannot be expanded even if demand grows rapidly.  \nMarketing.  Khadi  is  primarily  sold  through  7,050  dilapidated  retail  outlets  of \nkhadi institutions that are isolated from current marketing trends.  \nInstitutions. Khadi institutions are fragmented and dispersed, lack the expertise, \nfinancial means, and unified vision to adjust to changing market trends.  \n\n \n21. \nDistorted  Protective  Financial  Support.  Sustaining  khadi  though  sales  rebates  and \ninterest  rate  subsidy  has  had  little,  if  any,  positive  impact  on  the  production  and  marketing  of \nkhadi  and  the  employment  generation  through  khadi.  Subsidies  intended  as  incentives  for \npromoting  khadi  have  had  the  unintended  negative  effect  of  impeding  innovations  and \nsustaining dependencies that are resistant to change.  \n \n\nSales  rebate.  The  sales  rebate  applied  uniformly  on  khadi  products  impede \nmarket  segmentation.  Rebate  continues  on  product  categories  (silks,  merino \nwoolens, muslin) that hardly need support. The sales rebate leads to lumping of \nsales during the rebate period, which makes it difficult to assess the true market \npotential  of  khadi  products.  The  proposed  market  development  assistance \n(para.15 (i)) also does not facilitate market segmentation. \n \nInterest  rate  subsidy.  Banks  typically  fund  only  40%\u201350%  of  working  capital \nrequirement of khadi institutions as per the interest rate eligibility certificate (para. \n15(ii)). While marketing and production related reforms could shorten the working \ncapital  cycle,  working  capital  requirements  of  khadi  institutions  will  remain \nsignificant.  Interest  rate  eligibility  certificate  established  in  mid-1980s  needs \nupdation  for  ensuring  timely  and  adequate  access  to  working  capital.  Without \nthese,  khadi  will  remain  dependent  on  rebates  and  subsidies,  which  in  turn  will \nresult in a continued relative decline in market share.  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nIneffective  Marketing.  Mapping  out  the  production  process  and  product  cost  through \n22. \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nthe  cost  chart  breaks  the  link  between  production,  market,  and  price  points.  Inflexible  pricing \nbased on the cost chart provides no incentives for new designs and effective marketing. Further, \nthe existing marketing setup of khadi with limited marketing and product development know-how \n\n \n\n\fcannot target khadi firmly at market segments that are willing to pay for quality products. As a \nresult, khadi has yet to be systematically promoted as a brand that connotes social, cultural, and \nenvironmental values. Without an effective marketing and product strategy anchored to market \nand  improved  khadi  sales  outlets,  khadi  is  unlikely  to  compete  in  the  textile  market.  The \nparadigm  shift  from  supply-side  focus  based  on  cost  chart  to  demand-side  focus  needs  to  be \nmanaged by experienced marketing professionals. \n \n23. \nInconsistent  Raw  Material  Quality.  Raw  material  procurement  is  critical  from  the \nperspective of working capital requirements and quality of final product. Most khadi institutions \nprocure  cotton  primarily  for  direct  consumption  at  sliver  plants  operated  by  khadi  institutions. \nThese  sliver  plants  use  age-old  and  depreciated  machineries  and  also  lack  required  quality \ntesting  capabilities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  sliver  produced  by  central  sliver  plants  of  KVIC \naccount for only 30%16 of the total sliver production and cost nearly 10% more compared to the \nsliver  produced  by  the  sliver  plants  of  khadi  institutions.  Addressing  the  inadequacies  in  the \nquality and price of raw materials is critical for enhancing the value of khadi products.  \n \nLimited  Artisan  Earnings  and  Empowerment.  Inefficiencies in the value chain affect \n24. \nthe  potential  for  supplementary  income  for  the  rural  population.  The  majority  of  khadi  workers \nare employed by khadi institutions on a part-time basis and engaged in production only several \ndays a year. KVIC determines the income of artisans through conversion charges for different \nstages  of  the  production  process  (Tables  1  and  2).  While  the  conversion  charges  are  product \nand skill specific, increasing creativity and enterprise by spinners, weavers, and artisans cannot \nlead to higher income in view of the final price of the products and the applicable rebates being \nprefixed by the cost chart. At the same time, inadequate access to working capital and variable \nquality of raw materials limit production outputs, which constrain incomes that could have been \npossible  through  higher  production.  As  a  result,  the  earning  of  spinners  is  especially  low;  the \naverage spinner earned Rs822 per annum in FY2006. Spinners, 80% of whom are women, are \namong  the  poorest  paid  and  most  have  not  been  able  to  cross  the  poverty  threshold. 17 In \naddition, artisan representation in the governing board of khadi institutions is largely nominal. As \na result, improving the status of artisans is not necessarily a priority for khadi institutions. \n \n25. \nInadequate  Incentives  for  Entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurial  participation  under  the \nKVIC  khadi  program  is  restrained  by  the  impositions  on  legal  structure,  commercial  flexibility, \nand decision-making freedom. Other than the production and marketing of khadi through khadi \ninstitutions,  entrepreneurs  willing  to  produce  and  market  khadi  are  not  supported  under  the \nKVIC khadi program or the village industries program, in particular under the Rural Employment \nGeneration  Programme.  This  limits  the  potential  growth  of  the  production  base,  and  impedes \nthe flow of technology and entrepreneurship.  \n \n26. \nInsufficient Synergy with Traditional Village Industries. A multiplicity of government \nagencies, besides KVIC implement programs for the KVI subsector. The administrative effort in \ncoordinating these interventions often overlook the synergy between village industries and khadi. \nAmong all government agencies, KVIC is in a unique position to provide leadership in pooling of \nskills and resources for production and marketing of khadi as well as village industries starting \nfrom the household level, to khadi institutions, and up to the point of sale. Such synergy could \nbe  explored  through  identification  of  traditional  village  industries  that  are  in  line  with  the \n\n                                                 \n16 The balance is being produced by sliver plants of khadi institutions or procured from mills in the private sector. \n17 More than two-thirds of workers are from families below the poverty line. Nearly 60% of workers are either illiterate \n\nor have only primary education; 34% are illiterate.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ninadequate  and  old \n\ninfrastructure  (charkhas, \n\nOrganizational  Weaknesses  of  KVIC. \n\nhandmade characteristic of khadi, and developed through a cluster approach especially in areas \nwhere both khadi and traditional village industries are not widespread.  \n \n27.  Weak  Khadi  Institutions.  Barring  exceptions,  the  capabilities  of  khadi  institutions \nacross  the  entire  production  and  marketing  chain  need  substantial  improvements.  Most  khadi \ninstitutions  have \nlooms,  processing  unit, \ngarmenting  unit,  and  accounting  systems)  and  dilapidated  retail  outlets  that  will  impede  any \nreform measure from being effective. This is true even for khadi institutions categorized as A+, \nA, or B by KVIC. Currently, KVIC has no specific policy for C and D category khadi institutions. \nNearly 270 khadi institutions categorized as D continue to receive financial support from KVIC \nwithout any effective measures initiated to resolve their difficulties or facilitate their attrition.  \n  \ninitial  years,  KVIC  pursued  a \n28. \ndevelopmental agenda with emphasis on training and research. Over the years, KVIC undertook \nor  was  assigned  responsibilities  that  called  for  its  direct  participation  in  production,  marketing, \nand financing. Eventually, KVIC has gradually acquired the character and image of an entity for \ndispensing  government  funds  as  grants  and  loans.  The  norms  and  values  developed  over \ndecades  of  implementing  government  programs  have  led  to  skills  sets  that  are  insufficient  for \npositioning khadi as a commercially viable product in the highly competitive textile market. The \nproduction  of  raw  materials  for  khadi  and  direct  sales  of  khadi  are  not  among  the  core \ncompetencies of KVIC. In addition, the roles and responsibilities of available human resources \nare  insufficiently  detailed  leading  to  overlaps  and  uncoordinated  measures.  While  KVI \nproduction is decentralized, the roles of KVIC zonal and state offices remain limited. The current \nmanagement information system is unable to comprehend and link information on products and \ninstitutions that produce these products. Similarly, the database system remains inadequate for \nboth management and business development purposes.  \n \n\nits \n\nIn \n\n2.  \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n29. \nGiven its size and diversity, India has significant opportunities for khadi if it is efficiently \nproduced and marketed. Simultaneously, repositioning of khadi is needed to link the consumer \nperception  of  khadi  with \nfair  wage \ncharacteristics. These could help realize the following opportunities.  \n \n\nfriendly,  socially  conscious,  and \n\nits  environment \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEconomic.  Khadi\u2019s  employment  intensive  production  process  has  implications \nfor the livelihoods of millions of workers in rural India. Against this background, a \nnew niche needs to be found for khadi in context of ever-expanding choices for \nconsumers in the rapidly expanding and competitive textile market.  \nDevelopment.  KVIC and some enterprising khadi institutions have taken, albeit \nsporadic, measures to improve marketing and production of khadi in Gujarat and \nRajasthan,  resulting  in  increasing  year-round  sales  and  exports.  Similarly, \noutside  the  KVIC  khadi  program,  the  boutique  chain  Fabindia  has  grown  to  90 \noutlets.  These  indicate  the  potential  for  khadi  in  the  middle  and  upper-income \nconsumer segments. \nEnvironment.  The  values  underpinning  khadi  have  gained  impetus  in  the \ncontext  of  the  global  environmental  movement  and  the  emphasis  on  green  and \nsustainable  livelihoods.  Khadi  uses  organic  dyes  and  has  environment  friendly \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nproduction methods.

Khadi  as  an  economic  activity  is  geographically  widespread,  and \nencompasses  all  states  and  regions  in  the  country.  It  offers  an  opportunity  to \ncontribute to inclusive growth as it covers some of the country\u2019s poorest states, \nand  those  with  low  human  development.  Khadi  provides  employment  to  the \nsocially marginalized, women, and the older population.  \nGender.  Since a large part of the khadi workforce, especially spinners, are low-\npaid women, reforming the production and marketing of khadi can help enhance \ntheir  incomes,  reduce  wage  disparities,  and  enhance  empowerment.  This  is  in \naddition to providing opportunities for skills development, and giving them a voice \nin decisions relating to the production and distribution of khadi.  \n\n \n30. \nGovernment  Strategy.  Rapid  growth  that  reduces  poverty  and  creates  productive \nemployment opportunities is a major component of the Government\u2019s policy for inclusive growth \nduring  the  11th  FYP.  The  RNFS  is  recognized  as  a  major  inclusive  employment-generating \nsector. As a result, the Government has initiated public policy measures to ensure that the rural \npoor  are  able  to  participate  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth. 18  Reform  of  the  RNFS,  in \nparticular the KVI subsector, has thus emerged as a strategic government priority. Accordingly, \nthe Government, after intensive deliberations and stakeholder consultations, adopted the khadi \nreform package. The underlying reform principles are as follows.  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nEstablish a distinct and recognizable image of khadi.  \nIncrease private sector participation in khadi production and marketing.  \nCreate conducive conditions to encourage entrepreneurs to khadi production.  \nIntroduce incentives that facilitate market linkages.  \nEnhance artisan earnings and empowerment.  \nEnable institutional reforms and capacity building.  \n\n \n31. \nThe Government expects these reforms to enhance employment and increase incomes, \nespecially  for  women;  and  empower  the  rural  population  with  opportunities  to  meaningfully \nparticipate in and benefit from economic growth. Increases in productivity and incomes will help \ndraw  the  rural  work  force  to  KVI  and  reduce  dependence  on  agriculture  as  the  sole  source  of \nincome.  Realizing  the  importance  of  the  informal  sector  in  economic  growth,  the  Government \nexpects to replicate the key features of the khadi reform package for the KVI subsector.  \n \n32. \nExternal  Assistance  to  the  Sector. Development partners have ongoing interventions \nin  livelihood  development,  small  and  medium  enterprises,  and  financial  sector  with  rural \ndevelopment emphasis. The Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \nfunded Rural Livelihood Program aims to enhance livelihood, tackle hunger, and provide access \nto basic services in socially backward areas. The Small and Medium Enterprise Financing and \nDevelopment Project of the World Bank is enhancing small and medium enterprises access to \nfinance and business development services for employment creation. The World Bank, German \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \nand ADB19 are supporting the reform of the cooperative credit system in India. The development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n                                                 \n18 Bharat  Nirman  enhances  rural  infrastructure  in  roads,  power,  irrigation,  telecommunications,  among  others. \nUpgrading  of  the  rural  road  network  has  been  taken  up  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  scheme.  The \nNational  Rural  Employment  Program  being  implemented  since  2005  seeks  to  provide  100  days  employment  to \nable bodied rural residents. These are just some of the major policy measures and programs for the rural poor.  \n19 ADB.  2006.

The reform impetus for khadi is driven by the need to make khadi sustainable \n33. \nby  anchoring  KVI  to  market  prices  and  phasing  out  subsidies.  In  the  past,  other  traditional \nproducts have also been rejuvenated successfully, through appropriate measures. For instance, \nuntil  the  late  1980s,  poor  farmers  considered  jute  to  be  an  ideal  crop  for  rotation  with  rice. \nHowever,  synthetic  packaging  then  threatened  jute  as  the  traditional  material.  Prices  dropped \ndramatically  and  jute  farmers  plunged  into  poverty.  A  national  jute  development  program  was \nlaunched in 1992 with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme to evolve \nnew  technologies  and  applications  for  jute,  develop  new  machinery,  improve  quality,  develop \nmarkets, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and create a national institution for jute \ndiversification.  Today,  jute  offers  fashionable  and  eco-friendly  products that  are  attracting  new \nconsumers.  \n \nSimilarly, a national leather development program, initiated in 1992 with United Nations \n34. \nDevelopment Programme assistance, upgraded training systems for design and manufacture of \nfootwear, garments, and other leather products. The Leather Technology Mission, launched in \n1995, focused on fostering traditional and new skills of workers and artisans engaged in leather \nindustries, especially small and unorganized units, and promoting their links with the organized \nsector. These resulted in increased earnings and employment for artisans.  \n \n35. \nADB Strategy. Inclusive social development is a key strategic priority of ADB and one of \nthe three pillars of ADB operations in India, along with sustainable economic growth and good \ngovernance. ADB\u2019s proposed country partnership strategy and the earlier country strategy and \nprogram  update 20 highlight  the  need  for  strengthening  the  rural  sector  to  promote  inclusive \ndevelopment and stability of rural incomes and employment. In an assessment of this aspect of \nthe  strategy,  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation 21  noted  that  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment activities, among others, was likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of \nincome  and  nonincome  poverty.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy \n2020)22 acknowledges that support for rural areas is an underlying component of the inclusive \ngrowth  strategy.  To  promote  inclusive  growth,  it  seeks  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \nmicrofinance, rural finance institutions, and small and medium-sized enterprises, among others. \nCreating a conducive environment for khadi institutions and enabling them to emerge as viable \nentities is consistent with the ADB\u2019s overall strategic focus.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n36. \nThe impact of the proposed Khadi Reform and Development Program (the Program) is \nenhancement  of  income  and  employment  growth  for  the  RNFS.  The  Program  outcome  is \nrevitalization of the KVI subsector with enhanced sustainability of khadi, increased employment \ngeneration and incomes, increased artisan welfare, and development of select traditional village \nindustries. The reform of production and marketing of khadi will lead to sustainable employment \nopportunities  at  low  per  capita  investment.  In  addition  to  reduction  in  income  poverty,  the \nProgram  will  also  reduce  nonincome  poverty.

The  Program\u2019s  main  features  are  described  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 5) and policy matrix (Appendix 6). The Program draws on \nthe recommendations of high level working group of the Government, ADB assessment of policy \nand  institutional  aspects  of  khadi,23 and  intensive  consultation  with  stakeholders  over  the  last \ntwo years.  \n \n\n1. \n\nEstablishing a Policy Reform and Implementation Framework  \n\n38. \nA  Comprehensive  Reform  Package  for  the  Development  of  Khadi. The policy and \ninstitutional framework for khadi needs be anchored to the core principle of sustainability. Khadi \nhas to move away from a welfarist approach to a market-based approach. Accordingly, as part \nof the Program, the Government has formulated a comprehensive reform package for khadi and \nestablished  an  implementation  framework  for  KVIC  to  carry  out  the  proposed  reforms. \nSpecifically, under the Program  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  conducts  review  of  the  performance  of  KVIC  and  other \nsubsidiary  institutions  and  develops  a  khadi  reform  package  (Appendix  5)  for \nstrengthening production and marketing of khadi. \nKhadi  reform  package  comprising  policy,  legal,  marketing,  and  institutional \nreforms  for  achieving  sustainability  of  khadi  and  enhancing  artisan  income  and \nempowerment is agreed between the Government and KVIC. \nKVIC  develops  (a)  criteria  for  selecting  khadi  institutions  eligible  for  assistance \nunder the khadi reform package, and (b) memorandum of understanding (MOU) \non  comprehensive  reforms  of  khadi  institutions  with  performance  benchmarks \nand sanctions for khadi institutions that fail to meet the performance benchmarks. \nKVIC selects 300 khadi institutions eligible for support under the Program.  \n\n(iv) \n \nThese activities have been completed and set a strong foundation for implementation.24 \n39. \nDuring  implementation,  KVIC  will  disseminate  the  khadi  reform  package  nationwide  through \nworkshops  and  will  sign  MOUs  with  approximately  300  eligible  khadi  institutions  to  implement \nthe  khadi  reform  package.  Prior  to  assistance  under  the  Program,  independent  auditors  will \naudit  the  khadi  institutions.  Based  on  audit  findings,  a  minimum  threshold  for  acceptance  of \n\n                                                 \n23 The prominent reports are (i) the Khadi and Village Industries Review Committee (M. Ramakrishnayya), 1987; the \nbasis  for  changing  the  definition  of  village  industries;  (ii)  the  High  Power  Committee  constituted  under  the \nchairmanship  of  then  Prime  Minister  P.  V.  Narasimha  Rao  (1994)  based  on  which  the  Rural  Employment \nGeneration  Programme  was  introduced;  (iii)  the  Arthur  Andersen  Report  (2000)  addressing  the  organizational \nstructure  of  KVIC;  (iv)  the  KC  Pant  Report  (2001)  based  on  which  the  marketing  body,  Confederation  for \nPromotions of Khadi and Village Industries, was formed; and (v) the Expert Committee Report (D. M. Sukthankar), \n2005,  which  identified  the  need  for  change  in  KVIC\u2019s  structure  and  functioning.  ADB  assessment  in  2008 \nemphasized fundamental production and marketing reforms for enhanced sustainability of khadi.  \n\n24Criteria  for  selection  of  khadi  institutions  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A,  list  of  khadi  institutions  eligible  for \nProgram  support  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B,  and  draft  memorandum  of  understanding  between  KVIC  and \nkhadi institutions is in Supplementary Appendix C.     \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nkhadi  institutions  will  be  developed.  During  implementation,  assessment  of  the  reforms  will  be \nconducted and appropriate measures undertaken to address the feedback.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPromoting and Marketing Khadi \n\n40. \nEstablish  Identity  of  Khadi  through  a  Khadi  Mark. Creating a niche as a handspun \nand handwoven fabric produced through fair trade practices is the most likely way for khadi to \nbecome commercially viable in a highly competitive textiles market. The Program requires KVIC \nto develop a khadi mark including the design of a logo (i) as an indicator of genuine khadi and to \nbuild  awareness  and  popularity  of  khadi,  and  (ii)  to  guarantee  the  \u201cEarth  Friendly\u201d \n(handspun/woven  nature)  and  \u201cPeople  Centric\u201d/\u201cEthical\u201d  (employment,  primarily  to  women  on \nspecified  base  wages)  attributes  of  khadi.  The  khadi  mark  will  be  linked  to  specified  base \nearnings  for  artisans.  The  khadi  mark  will  be  registered  under  the  Trade  Mark  Act  in  order  to \nensure legal protection25 and regulations for granting the use of khadi mark will be developed. \nAll khadi institutions affiliated to KVIC and KVIB will adopt the khadi mark. In addition to khadi \ninstitutions, institutions external to the KVIC khadi program will also be allowed to use the khadi \nmark. Further, basic testing infrastructure for khadi mark will be created and KVIC will conduct \nrandom spot audits on the adherence to licensing requirements for khadi mark. The procedures \nand the enforceability of intellectual property rights are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\n \nEffective Marketing through Private Sector Participation. Professional capability and \n41. \norientation to assess evolving market dynamics and the flexibility to respond swiftly is critical for \nthe effective marketing of khadi. Under the Program, KVIC will identify private partner to set up \na  majority  private-owned  marketing  organization  outside  of  KVIC.  The  responsibilities  of  the \nmarketing organization include (i) developing marketing strategies, (ii) identifying products to be \nmarketed in domestic and international markets, (iii) introducing public-private partnership (PPP) \nin  the  department  sales  outlets  of  KVIC,  and  (iv)  rejuvenating  the  sales  outlets  of  khadi \ninstitutions  (or  Institutional  Sales  Outlets).  KVIC  will  transfer  the  right  of  promoting  and  using \nkhadi  mark  to  the  marketing  organization  under  a  licensing  agreement.  Draft  business  plan  of \nthe marketing organization is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n \n3. \n\nRealizing Procurement and Production Efficiencies  \n\n42. \nFacilitate Procurement and Processing of Raw Materials. High cost of raw material, \nprocessing inefficiencies, and inadequate testing capabilities are major constraints in the khadi \nvalue chain. Accordingly, the Program requires actions for improving procurement, processing, \nand quality control of raw material i.e., sliver. KVIC will establish quality norms for raw material \nprocurement  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  by  khadi  institutions  and  also  train  them  on  quality \ntesting  of  raw  materials.  KVIC  will  also  develop  a  sliver  capacity  augmentation  plan  for  khadi \ninstitutions after a detailed assessment of the current production capacity and constraints.26 To \ndisengage  KVIC  from  sliver  production,  a  fund  has  been  created  under  the  Program \n(Supplementary  Appendix  G)  to  kick  start  private  sector  participation in central  sliver  plants  of \nKVIC through PPPs. Two central sliver plants of KVIC are targeted to be converted into PPPs in \nthe first year of the Program and the remaining central sliver plants by the end of the Program.  \n \n                                                 \n25 Such protection includes the right for the holder of a registered intellectual property right, i.e., trademark or a trade \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ndescription to file a suit in the court seeking permanent injunction against the person infringing the trademark; claim \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \ndamages; and restraining the other party from disposing assets in a manner which adversely affects the ability of \nthe holder of the registered intellectual property rights to recover the damages, costs, or other remedies. \n\n26 Based  on  detailed  assessment  of  the  status  of  plant  equipment,  geographical  dispersion,  capacity  and  current \n\nutilization levels, product mix, and quality of current production center. \n\n \n\n\f43.  Market-Linked Pricing to Replace Cost-Based Pricing. Inflexible product pricing due \nto the cost chart and its linkage with the rebate limits the scope for enhancing artisan earnings. \nThe  cost  chart  also  inhibits  creativity,  enterprise,  and  the  potential  for  artisans  to  enhance \nearnings.  A  benefit  chart,  as  a  replacement,  would  ensure  better  linkage  of  production, \nmarketing, and pricing by enabling the khadi institutions to set khadi prices as determined by the \nmarket.  While  the  proposed  khadi mark  is  intended  to  ensure  payment  of  base  wages27 by  all \nproducers  of  khadi,  the  benefit  chart  is  intended  to  ensure  that  surpluses  are  used  for  the \nbenefits  of  the  khadi  artisans  and  workers. 28  Accordingly,  the  Program  requires  KVIC  to \nformulate  and  implement  a  benefit  chart  in  respect  of  khadi  institutions.  KVIC  will  organize \ntraining  in  coordination  with  the  marketing  organization  for  product  pricing  and  familiarization \nwith the benefit chart. The impact of benefit chart on artisans earnings will be assessed.  \n \nRationalize  Financial  Assistance  for  Khadi.  Anchoring  the  production  of  khadi  to \n44. \nmarkets requires that financial support that impede innovations and enterprise be discontinued. \nHowever, this will need to be done gradually in a manner that does not cause disruption in the \nartisan  income  and  employment  status.  Under  the  Program,  KVIC  will  formulate  a  production \nincentive plan for all khadi products and shift to production incentives in lieu of the sales rebate \nand  market  development  assistance.  Further,  during  the  Program  period,  in  consultation  with \nthe  marketing  organization,  KVIC  will  also  determine  the  product  categories  on  which  the \nproduction  incentives  could  be  phased  out.  Interest  subsidy  eligibility  certificate  will  also  be \nphased  out  along  with  phasing  out  of  production  incentives  on  specific  product  categories.  In \naddition,  working  capital  requirements  for  khadi  institutions  will  be  assessed  and  access  to \nworking capital will be facilitated.  \n \nCreate  New  Khadi  Ventures  with  Greater  Entrepreneurial  Activity  and  Enhanced \n45. \nArtisan  Empowerment.  In  order  to  spur  growth  in  khadi  and  empower  artisans,  under  the \nProgram, KVIC will develop and  implement a producer company29 model and an entrepreneur \nmodel, for new khadi ventures under the KVIC khadi program. These will complement the khadi \ninstitutions by enhancing the production and marketing base of khadi. The producer company, \nas a means of artisan empowerment, only comprises primary producers (artisans, spinners, and \nweavers) which collectively appoint a governing board responsible for all decisions to be made \nfor the producer company. The enterprise model enables enterprises without sacrificing artisan \nincome and empowerment and authenticity of khadi that could avail assistance from KVIC in the \nform of Rural Employment Generation Programme assistance (para. 11 (ii)).  \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementing Institutional Reforms  \n\n46. \nOrganizational  Restructuring  of  KVIC  for  Better  Focus  on  Facilitative  and \nDevelopment  Role.  Given  the  enormous  inclusive  development,  employment,  and  income \ngenerating scope of khadi, KVIC has significant responsibilities to discharge and a pivotal role to \nplay  as  the  nodal  institution  for  the  development  of  khadi.  Efforts  to  reform  KVIC  have  so  far \nbeen  fragmented  and,  as  a  result,  it  currently  is  neither  appropriately  organized  nor  skilled  to \nbring  about  an  intended  transformation  in  khadi.  KVIC  needs  to  focus  on  promotional  and \n\n                                                 \n27 Khadi institutions will have the flexibility to pay over and above the base wages. \n28 Options for artisan\u2019s benefits suggested are (i) at least 50% of the surplus to be distributed as bonus on fiscal year \nend to artisans based on production record, and (ii) the balance earnings to be utilized for creating provisions for \nfuture capital requirements including improved equipment and benefits for artisans. \n\n29 Set  up  as  per  provisions  of  Companies  (Amendment)  Act  2002,  the  producer  company  can  form  alliance  or \npartnership with any entrepreneur or entity for marketing its products. Details of models for new khadi ventures are \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ndevelopment role and gradually disengage from direct commercial activities, such as production \nand marketing, which are not specifically based on its core competencies. Simultaneously, KVIC \nneeds  to  play  a  facilitative  role  to  strengthen  khadi  institutions,  enhance  the  stake  and  role  of \nartisans, facilitate the flow of raw materials and finances, and to create a niche for khadi through \nkhadi mark. Under the Program, KVIC will adopt and implement a restructuring and devolution \nplan (Supplementary Appendix I) including (i) restructuring khadi, village industries, science and \ntechnology,  and  economic  research  directorates;  (ii)  strengthening  of  human  resource  and \nadministration  directorate;  (iii)  realignment  of  reporting  relationships;  and  (iv)  devolution  of \npowers  and  responsibilities  to  zonal  offices.  In  addition,  KIVC  will  also  develop  an  integrated \nmanagement information and e-governance system.  \n\n \n47. \nRevitalize  Khadi  Institutions.  Being  fragmented  and  dispersed,  the  khadi  institutions \nlack  the  professional  expertise,  financial  capacity,  and  a  unified  vision  to  adapt  to  evolving \nmarket trends. As primary level producer and marketers of khadi, the reform of khadi institutions \nconstitute  the  base  for  the  transformation  of  khadi  envisaged  by  the  Government.  Under  the \nProgram,  KVIC  will  implement  the  comprehensive  reform  plan  for  300  khadi  institutions, \nselected  primarily  on  the  basis  of  performance,  to  ensure  enhanced  artisan  earnings  and \nempowerment and improved viability of khadi institutions, through (i) production, (ii) marketing, \n(iii) governance, and (iv) information technology and e-governance. The model comprehensive \nreform plan has been developed with due recognition of the need for adaptation to requirements \nof  specific  khadi  institutions.  Reforms  are  phased  to  enable  evaluation  and  incorporation  of \nlessons  learned.  The  scope  of  comprehensive  reforms  at  khadi  institution  level  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n \nIn  addition,  all  khadi  institutions 30  will  be  recategorized  based  on  new  norms  that \n48. \nemphasize  (i)  role  for  artisans,  (ii)  governance  structure,  (iii)  human  resources,  (iv)  financial \nhealth, and (v) diversified networks and market linkages.  \n \nStrengthen  the  Capability  of  All  Institutions.  Systemic  and  pervasive  skills  deficit \n49. \npersists at all levels in the set up for khadi. These deficits will have to be addressed at the level \nof the institutions (KVIC, khadi institutions) as well as at the artisan level. The Program requires \nthe  development  of  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  plan,  including  physical  infrastructure \nand  training  of  trainers,  to  strengthen  capabilities  at  all  levels.  The  comprehensive  capacity \nbuilding plan, based on assessment of existing training arrangements (infrastructure, capacity of \ntrainers,  and  curriculum),  will  adopt  a  two-pronged  focus  (i)  demand:  a  team  within  KVIC\u2019s \nhuman  resources  development  directorate  to  focus  on  regular  interaction  with  all  other \nthe  demand \ndirectorates  and \n(nature/sector/skill  level)  for  training;  and  (ii)  supply:  developing  linkages  with  external  training \nprograms,  enhancing  the  training  institutes  under  the  KVIC,  and  detailing  and  implementing \ncapacity building. \n\nthe  marketing  organization, \n\nto  continuously  assess \n\n \n50. \nDevelop Synergies with Traditional Village Industries. There are inherent synergies \nbetween khadi and traditional village industries, which are in line with the overall ethos of khadi \n\u2013 \u201chandmade,\u201d \u201cuse of organic inputs/processes\u201d and/or \u201csocially aware.\u201d The Program requires \nKVIC  to  identify  around  five  \u201ctraditional  village  industries\u201d  such  as  herbal  products,  honey, \nhandmade paper, cane, and pottery based on a market survey by the marketing organization. A \ncluster approach to pool efforts for developing the identified traditional village industries will be \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nadopted  in  consultation  with  the  marketing  organization.  The  capacity  building  needs  for  the \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n30 The Program covers 300 eligible khadi institutions whereas the reform of all khadi institutions is part of the khadi \n\nreform package. The Government will develop customized restructuring plan for weak khadi institutions.  \n\n \n\n\fcluster  will  be  integrated  with  the  comprehensive  capacity  building  plan  and  implemented \nsimultaneously. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n51. \nThe Government\u2019s desire to pursue fundamental khadi reforms allows ADB to participate \nin a high-priority inclusive development intervention. The Program will serve to initiate reforms of \nkhadi  institutions  as  well  as  future  initiatives  in  village  industries,  and  in  the  entire  informal \nsector.  This  could  enable  continued  ADB  participation  in  interventions  that  conform  to  the \nStrategy 2020 agenda of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. Creating conducive \nenabling environment for khadi entrepreneurs will promote inclusive growth. The Government\u2019s \nrequest  for  ADB  support  is  in  recognition  of  its  involvement  in  developing  the  khadi  reform \npackage and the intensive effort for building a consensus on the khadi reform package.  \n \n52. \nInclusive  Growth.  Development  experience  indicates  that  rapid,  broad-based,  and \nlabor-intensive economic growth is the most effective means to reduce poverty, and contribute \nto  inclusive  growth.  The  Program  provides  a  framework  for  (i)  drawing  seasonally  affected \nagrarian  poor  into  RNFS  opportunities  for  income  enhancement,  (ii)  directly  increasing \nemployment  and  incomes  of  rural  artisans  through  the  reforms,  and  (iii)  reducing  distress \nmigration from rural areas through the step up in RNFS work opportunities. Broader sharing of \nthe  benefits  of  growth  facilitated  by  a  shift  to  RNFS  will  enhance  social  stability  and  hence, \nreinforce the sustainability of the development process.  \n \n53. \nParticipatory  Process.  The  Program  was  formulated  in  a  participatory  manner. \nExtensive consultations with producer groups and beneficiaries from all geographic regions and \nsocial  groups  in  the  country,  were  undertaken  during  program  preparation.  Consultations  with \ncivil society provided useful insights on wages, technology and women\u2019s role, and overall social \nand institutional issues. These are in addition to extensive consultations with various segments \nin  the  Government  and  development  community.  During  program  implementation,  gender  and \nNGO  institutions  development  experts  will  ensure  a  participatory  approach  by  carrying  out \ninformation  dissemination,  need  assessments,  and  capacity  development  planning  especially \nfor women and disadvantaged beneficiaries. \n \n54. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  The  Program  seeks  to  enable  greater  participation  of \nprivate  entrepreneurs  by  enabling  the  use  of  the  khadi  mark  and  production  and  marketing \nkhadi  through  new  ventures.  In  addition,  phasing  out  of  raw  material  production  from  KVIC \nthrough  PPPs  and  establishing  a  majority  private-owned  marketing  organization  will  facilitate \ngreater private sector participation in khadi production.  \n \n55. \nEmpowering Artisans. The Program introduces direct measures for enhancing income \nand  empowering  artisans,  majority  of  whom  are  rural  poor  women.  By  altering  the  norms  of \ngovernance and operations at the khadi institutions, enabling new khadi ventures, and ensuring \nfair wages through the khadi mark, the Program facilitates a level playing field in rural economic \nrelations.  Nearly  half  of  the  program  resources  are  directed  to  support  khadi  institutions  that \nserve as primary khadi producers and marketers.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe Government has requested a loan of $150,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n56. \ncapital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nInterbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n57. \nThe  ADB  funds  will  support  reforms  that  address  complex  and  fundamental  issues  as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  5)  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix  6).  Costs \nare triggered by policy and institutional reforms, especially for revitalizing khadi institutions; and \nconstitute  the  bulk  of  the  cost.  KVIC  estimates  the  cost  of  strengthening  all  1,952  khadi \ninstitutions at nearly $800 million over 4 years. The cost of reforms is expected to exceed these \nestimates, if delays are encountered. The impact of proposed reforms on phasing out subsidies \nwill  only  be  felt  in  the  medium  term,  i.e.,  when  the  khadi  institutions  selected  for  program \nsupport make a turnaround and become sustainable, and other khadi institutions are reformed \nalong  similar  lines  through  Government  support.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \ncounterpart  funds  are  used  for  costs  associated  with  reforms  introduced  under  the  Program \n(para. 94).31  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n58.  MMSME, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall Program implementation. \nKVIC, the Implementing Agency, will be responsible for implementation of reforms. MMSME and \nKVIC will ensure a conducive environment, provide adequate powers and resources to KVIC\u2019s \nreform  implementation  division  (RID)  and  the  reform  management  units  (RMU),  and  be \nresponsible  for  issuing  necessary  notifications  and  directives  to  facilitate  implementation  and \nestablishment  of  the  khadi  mark  and  the  marketing  organization.  The  program  management \nchart is in Appendix 7. \n \n59. \nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  KVIC  will  establish  the  RID,  which  will  be  responsible  for  \n(i) coordinating actions under the Program in accordance with the implementation schedule, and \n(ii)  monitoring  overall  program  progress.  The  RID  will  be  headed  by  a  KVIC  director  with \nsufficient  knowledge  and  experience  in  KVI  related  programs,  who  will  report  to  KVIC\u2019s  chief \nexecutive officer. The RID will comprise four subdivisions: (i) promotion and marketing, (ii) raw \nmaterial procurement and production, (iii) institutional reform, and (iv) program coordination and \nadministration.  KVIC  will  assign  about  13  of  its  officers  to  the  RID  and  about  7  administrative \nstaff. Consultants (para. 72) will be hired to provide specialist support. Within one month of loan \neffectiveness, KVIC will establish an RMU at each of its state and divisional offices to manage \nand monitor program implementation at khadi institutions. Each RMU will be headed by a KVIC \nassistant director or an official of similar rank, and at least one officer will be assigned to support \nthe  head.  The  RMUs  will  coordinate  with  khadi  institutions  and  facilitate  monitoring  and \nimplementation of the reforms under the Program.   \n \nPrior to loan effectiveness, MMSME will set up a reform implementation and monitoring \n60. \ncommittee  to  be  chaired  by  the  MMSME  secretary.  The  committee  will  serve  as  the  program \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nsteering  committee,  and  (i)  provide  policy  and  technical  guidance  to  KVIC  and  the  RID,  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n(ii) review the progress of program implementation, (iii) monitor the performance of the RID and \n                                                 \n31 The breakdown of the costs is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nRMUs,  and  (iv)  ensure  program  coordination.  It  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  of  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nTextiles,  KVIC,  a  marketing  expert  from  the  Confederation  of  Indian  Industry,  and  a  financial \nexpert from the banking sector.  \n \n\nThe policy conditions, spread over four tranches, will be implemented over 3 years, from \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n61. \nOctober 2008 to September 2011 (Appendix 8).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nIn accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \n62. \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The loan proceeds will be utilized to finance the \nfull  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  imports  produced  in,  and \nprocured from, ADB member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, the amount \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan proceeds \nwill be utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed based on \ncertification  provided  by  the  Government  confirming  that  the  requirements  for  the  loan  have \nbeen  met.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\n4. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n63. \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  four  tranches  over  3  years.  The  first  tranche  of  \n$20  million  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $40  million  is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  8  months  of  the  first  tranche,  the  third  tranche  of  $40  million \nwithin 13 months of the second tranche, and the fourth tranche of $50 million within 15 months \nof  the  third  tranche;  each  will  be  subject  to  compliance  with  their  respective  tranche  release \nconditions. The phasing of tranche release actions is in policy matrix (Appendix 6).  \n  \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nAn  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  undertaken  if  requested  by  ADB  and \n64. \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Immediately  after  the  loan  effective  date, \nthe Government shall establish a special account at a commercial bank acceptable for ADB for \nthe  special  purpose  of  depositing  and  utilizing  the  counterpart  funds.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  to  receive  all  loan \nproceeds. The accounts will be established, managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance \nwith  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  MMSME,  through  KVIC,  will  maintain  separate  records  and \naccounts  on  the  use  of  the  counterpart  funds  following  sound  accounting  principles,  and  will \nhave  such  accounts  and  records  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will \nfurnish, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit report with \nauditors\u2019 opinion to the Government and ADB. \n  \n65. \nKVIC through RID will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within \n20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable \nto  ADB  and  include  (i)  project  progress  in  each  state  and  component,  (ii)  the  status  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ninstitutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to \nresolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 3 \nmonths. Within 3 months of program completion, KVIC will prepare and submit to ADB, through \nMMSME, a project completion report including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\nfor \n\ninstitutions  eligible \n\nindependent  audits  of  khadi \n\nThe  Program  directly  addresses  governance  issues  related  to  KVIC  and  khadi \n66. \nthe \ninstitutions  by  (i)  conducting \ncomprehensive  reform  plan,  (ii)  reforming  the  governance  structure  of  khadi  institutions  for \nartisans\u2019 autonomy and empowerment by modifying the categorization norms and introducing a \nnew khadi venture model, (iii) establishing new rules for usage and authority of the khadi mark \nand  conducting  random  spot  audits  for  khadi  institutions  on  the  licensing  requirement  for  the \nkhadi  mark,  and  (iv)  implementing  institutional  reforms  for  KVIC.  Independent  audit  of  khadi \ninstitutions will reduce the vulnerability to corruption. Modifying the categorization norm of khadi \ninstitutions and institutional reform  of KVIC will ensure (i) enhanced corporate governance, (ii) \ncompliance  with  transparency  and  disclosure  requirements,  and  (iii)  adequate  monitoring \nmechanisms. A governance and anticorruption risk assessment is in Appendix 10.  \n \n67. \nIn  addition,  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Second \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan 32  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  Implementing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  implementation  of  the  Program  shall  adhere  to \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). ADB reserves the right to review and \nexamine,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices relating the Program. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would \nbe  requested  by  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Government.  In  this  context,  a  financial \nmanagement  assessment  was  also  undertaken  by  the  Executing  Agency  (Supplementary \nAppendix K) to provide assurance that ADB loan funds will be used for their intended purpose. \nADB  will  regularly  review  the  financial  reports  of  the  audit  authorities  to  assess  any  potential \nfinancial  and  administrative  irregularities.  During  regular  review  missions,  the  financial \nmanagement,  and  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessments  will  be  updated  to  ensure \nthat their provisions remain valid and are helping the reforms to succeed. \n \n\n7. \n\nFiduciary Management  \n\nThe KVIC Act, 1956 stipulates the fund flow control from the Ministry of Finance through \n68. \nMMSME requiring funds to be segregated into three funds: the khadi fund, the village industry \nfund, and the general and miscellaneous fund. Transfers of financing between the three funds \nor the use of funds for other purposes are subject to MMSME approval. The KVIC accounts are \nsubject to auditing by the comptroller and auditor general of India. Audit of khadi institutions is \nregularly  conducted  and  the  standing  order  No.  1616  of  KVIC  stipulates  (i)  a  pro forma  of  the \naudit  and/or  inspection  report  on  the  affairs  of  khadi  institutions,  (ii)  code  of  operation  on  the \nfindings of the audit report, and (iii) code of administrative action on findings of audit reports for \nthe fund flow from KVIC to khadi institutions. The transfer of loan proceeds from KVIC to khadi \ninstitutions  based  on  MOUs  between  KVIC  and  khadi  institutions  will  bind  the  usage,  release, \nand monitoring of the fund flows with the terms and corresponding conditions to implement the \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \npolicy actions. The independent audit of eligible khadi institutions is also part of policy conditions. \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nThese together will help ensure the use of loan proceeds for program objectives.  \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n69. \nKVIC  through  RID  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program  performance  management \nsystem including a database on the status of policy actions and program indicators based on \nthe policy matrix.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProgram Review \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  throughout  program \n70. \nimplementation  to  identify  actions  required  for  the  continued  development  of  the  khadi  sector. \nThe midterm review will be undertaken within 18 months from loan effectiveness and will review \n(i)  compliance  status  of  the  third  tranche  conditions,  (ii)  status  and  implementation  of  policies, \n(iii) status and implementation of reforms, (iv) initial lessons, and (v) progress in achieving the \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n71. \nA  TA  grant  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan  in  the \namount of $2 million is attached to the Program. The goal of the TA titled Capacity Building for \nReforming  the  Khadi  and  Village  Industry  Subsector  is  to  support  implementation  of  the  khadi \nreform package and its objective is to expedite commencement of the reforms. The purpose of \nthe TA is to strengthen implementation and monitoring of the khadi reform package to revitalize \nkhadi as a source of robust nonfarm livelihoods for many rural poor. The TA will consist of the \nfollowing components: \n \n\nStrengthen  program  management.  The  TA will  support MMSME  and  KVIC  in \nthe overall management, implementation, and monitoring of the Program.   \n\nPromote and market khadi. The TA will facilitate the design and adoption of the \nkhadi mark, and the establishment and operation of the marketing organization.  \n\nFacilitate  procurement  and  production.  The  TA  will  facilitate  raw  material \nprocurement  and  sliver  production,  introduce  market-linked  pricing,  rationalize \nfinancial assistance, and develop the framework for new khadi ventures. \n\nSupport institutional reforms. The TA will support capacity building of KVIC to \nenable greater focus on developmental role. It will also assist the transformation \nof  the  khadi  institutions  into  viable  entities;  and  provide  capacity  development \nsupport to artisans, especially to women, including information dissemination on \nreforms,  constraint  mitigation,  skills  development,  and  awareness  creation  for \nempowerment.  \n\n \n72. \nAligned  with  the  Program,  MMSME  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency  and  KVIC  the \nImplementing  Agency.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2.50  million  comprising  \n$2  million  funded  by  ADB  (the  Japan  Special  Fund)  to  be  used  for  hiring  approximately  210 \nperson-months of national consultants, and $0.50 million funded by the Government to be used \nfor  counterpart  support,  office  accommodation  and  related  services,  communications,  reports, \nand workshops. The consultant inputs, terms of reference, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements are in Supplementary Appendix L. The TA will commence in October  2008 and \nbe  completed  in  September  2011.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  full  technical  proposal.  Two  consultants  will  be \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nhired as individual consultants. Consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\n1. \n\nPolicy \n\n73. \nThe  Program\u2019s  comprehensive  reform  agenda  will  enhance  the  policy  environment  for \nefficient  and  effective  production  and  marketing  of  khadi  with  multiple  benefits.  The  Program \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP  commitments  of  reforming  KVIC,  shifting  khadi  from  a \nwelfare approach to a unique selling proposition approach, and promoting the intrinsic qualities \nof khadi, i.e., handcrafted, handspun, and energy saving. The Program facilitates enlisting new \nkhadi institutions and entrepreneurs, strengthening khadi institutions, strengthening raw material \nsupply, addressing input and working capital shortages, registering khadi as a brand name and \ndomain name, and strengthening the marketing network. The khadi mark; abolition of the cost \nchart; entry of new entrepreneurs, the marketing organization, and PPPs will end the controlled \nproduction and marketing of khadi under the KVIC khadi program. Khadi production, marketing, \nand  pricing  will  be  better  aligned  with  the  market  as  a  result  of  discontinuing  the  archaic  cost \nchart  system.  Infusing  professionalism  in  marketing  and  encouraging  PPPs  will  ensure  a \nconsumer-linked  marketing  strategy.  In  addition,  rationalizing  raw  material  procurement  and \nproduction, and streamlining financial assistance will decrease the working capital requirements \nfor khadi institutions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional \n\n74. \nThe institutional reform of KVIC strengthens its development role by enhancing capacity \nfor strategic planning. Disengaging KVIC from raw material production and direct marketing will \nenable it to focus on revitalizing khadi institutions. The Program recategorizes and reforms weak \nkhadi  institutions.  Enhanced  governance,  production,  and  marketing  of  khadi  institutions  will \nserve to increase artisan income. Together, these provide the basis for replicating reforms to the \nbroader KVI subsector. \n  \n\n3. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  Program  will  generate  much-needed  employment  opportunities  in  khadi  and \n75. \nenhance  incomes  (rates  of  remuneration)  of  artisans.  The  employment  intensity  of  the \nregistered units in the micro, small and medium enterprise sector including khadi indicates that \nan investment of Rs72,000 creates employment for one person compared with Rs556,000 in the \nlarge  organized  sector.  Employment  in  khadi  institutions  will  increase  because  of  expanded \nproduction  supported  by  improved  raw  material  procurement  and  enhanced  working  capital. \nNew marketing and product strategies will increase the sales of khadi products. Employment will \nbe  generated  by  introducing  new  khadi  ventures  using  the  producer  company  model  and \nentrepreneur  model.  Replacement  of  the  cost  chart  with  market-linked  pricing  will  let  khadi \ninstitutions determine pricing based on the product value rather than cost, to respond to market \ndynamics and incorporate commercial sensitivities. Artisan\u2019s base wages are to be ensured by \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nthe proposed khadi mark, while the introduction of the benefit chart will ensure that any surplus \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nis used for the benefits of artisans. Enhanced institutional sustainability of KVIC will enable it to \nmobilize funds and human resources more efficiently in supporting the KVI subsector. Improved \nviability of khadi products and enhanced sustainability of khadi institutions will gradually reduce \nthe need for budgetary support to khadi. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironment \n\n76. \nThe  khadi  production  and  marketing  reforms  supported  by  the  Program  emphasize \ngovernance,  marketing,  and  institutional  restructuring.  No  physical  construction  activities  are \nexpected. The fundamental nature of KVI activities, including khadi, is based on agriculture and \nrural  technology.  Generating  additional  employment  of  this  nature  will  be  environmentally \nsustainable  and  eco-friendly.  It  will  have  indirect  beneficial  effects  on  health  both  in  terms  of \nproduction  processes  and  the  organic  nature  of  products  generated.  Khadi  production  is  also \namenable to the use of clean (solar) energy powered improved production techniques that are \nenvironment friendly and eliminate drudgery in spinning, especially for women. The Program\u2019s \ncomprehensive  capacity  building  plan  will  incorporate  (i)  training  and/or  environmental \nawareness raising for artisans, and (ii) transfer and uptake of pollution prevention technologies \nand  techniques  to  concerned  khadi  institutions.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy \nmatrix has no potential adverse environmental impact. The environment category is C.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSocial and Poverty \n\n77. \nAt  the  macro  level,  the  Program  will  promote  inclusive  growth  and  have  significant \npoverty  reduction  and  social  impacts. 33  It  will  help  increase  employment  opportunities  and \nincomes in the labor intensive KVI subsector, thereby enhancing social stability in rural areas. \nIncreased value addition will be accompanied by measures to increase distribution of enhanced \nrevenues  to  artisans.  A  significant  benefit  is  the  participation  of  artisans  in  the  governance  at \nkhadi institutions through representation at the governing board, involvement in decision making, \nand participation in distribution of the surplus. These together will constitute participating in, and \nbenefiting from the development of khadi. The reforms will benefit the artisans and workers in \nthe  sector,  and  increase  the  competitiveness  of  the  rural  labor  market,  thus  improving \nagriculture  labor  wages.  Such  increases  in  income  would  clearly  bring  about  a  reduction  in \nnonincome  poverty,  with  enhanced  education  and  health  spending,  given  the  nature  of \nexpenditure elasticity for higher incomes in this sector. \n \n78. \nThe  impact  of  KVI  on  rural  development  and  rural\u2013urban  migration  is  significant.  The \nexpected  sector  growth  as  the  result  of  the  reforms  will  create  substantial  employment  and \nincome  generating  opportunities  in  the  rural  sector  especially  for  women  and  those  in  remote \nand  hilly  areas.  KVI  covers  261,000  of  India\u2019s  639,000  villages,  more  than  40%.  Spinning  is \nlargely carried out by women belonging to disadvantaged sections of society, who receive only \nseveral  days  to  a  few  months  of  part-time  employment.  However,  the  reforms  will  result  in \nengaging them for longer periods and providing them with a substantial and diversified source of \nincome in addition to their subsistence farming. The Program\u2019s assistance to empower producer \ngroups and artisan societies will ensure the poor and marginalized realize equitable wages and \nincreased benefits. The Program will not have any adverse impact on indigenous peoples. The \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  11.  A  gender  action  plan  to \nenhance and monitor impacts on women is attached as Appendix 12.  \n \n79. \nLabor Standards. The Program seeks to enhance employment and income of artisans. \nIn doing so, it would promote greater adherence to core labor standards for khadi. The reforms \nwill promote widespread production under the quality control of a khadi mark. The khadi mark, a \nlegally  registered  trade  mark  for  certification  of  khadi,  would  also  cover  guaranteed  minimum \n\n                                                 \n33 Gender  assessment  and  action  plan  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  N  and  poverty  impact  assessment  of  policy \n\nreforms is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nwages  for  artisans.  This  will  ensure  that  artisans  are  not  deprived  or  discriminated  against  on \nremuneration.  The  reform  will  not  include  labor  retrenchment,  but  rather  address  the  issue  of \nunderemployment of the rural sector by expanding the khadi production base.  \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n80. \nThe  Program  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing  issues  and  socially \nsignificant measures to enhance employment and empowerment for the poor and marginalized. \nSuch  reforms  entail  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory,  governance,  and  institutional \nissues.  At  the  macro  level,  the  reform  agenda  is  driven  by  the  growing  recognition  of \nstakeholders of the significance of improving the living conditions of the rural population. While \nthis  is  the  most  effective  measure  to  ensure  sustained  reform  commitment  at  all  levels, \nachieving  expected  impacts  will  depend  on  several  assumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying \ndegrees of risk. Mitigation measures are being put in place wherever feasible and appropriate.  \n \n81. \nReform  Commitment. Despite the Government\u2019s successful track record in generating \nemployment in the RNFS, there is a significant risk in dealing with khadi institutions particularly \nthe likelihood that khadi institutions may prefer to remain in the current protective low-risk and \nlow-return arrangement where government support is assured. In addition, the extensive reform \nhierarchy  extending  all  the  way  down  to  the  grassroots  could  slow  the  momentum  of  reforms. \nThese risks are dealt with in part by front loading the conditions relating to the policy reform and \nimplementation  framework,  up-front  legal  assurances,  and  phased  financial  assistance. \nProgram support is based on defined criteria and continuity of support will require achievement \nof specified key results.  \n \n82. \nImplementation. The  risk  of  implementation  delay  due  to inadequate capacity  is being \nminimized by (i) extensive consensus building leading34 to a detailed implementation framework, \nand  (ii)  adequate  technical  support  for  capacity  building.  The  design  of  the  implementation \narrangements  reflects  the  necessity  of  pooling  the  limited  in-house  resources  in  KVIC  and \nsupplementing this with the TA specialists. The attached TA is designed to ensure that actions are \ntimebound  and  well  coordinated.  In  addition,  ADB  financial  assistance  will  be  released  in  four \ntranches,  which  provides  considerable  scope  for  dialogue  with  the  Government,  allows  more \ntime for the Government to address any implementation issues, and helps increase stakeholder \nownership.  An  intensive  orientation  program  on  implementation  aspects  will  be  conducted  at \nprogram start-up. \n \nInstitutional  Reforms.  KVIC,  the  KVIBs,  and  khadi  institutions  may  have  difficulty \n83. \nadapting to reforms. Staff behavior could prove resistant to institutional and governance reforms, \nthereby  undermining  the  expected  improvements  in  performance.  Factors  that  mitigate  these \nrisks include (i) up-front commitment to the new framework, governance, business procedures, \nand autonomy; (ii) redefinition of the institutional role and vision; and (iii) significant investments \nin  information  technology,  and  management  information  systems  and  procedures,  and  human \nresource development.  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Perception.  The  private  sector\u2019s  confidence  to  invest and  associate  in \n84. \nthe  KVIC  khadi  program  depends  on  whether  the  Government  and  KVIC  can  produce \nsuccessful  outcomes  as  a  result  of  the  reform.  Any  redirection  of  the  reform  policies  might \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ncause  the  private  sector  to  lose  confidence.  The  program  measures  to  improve  investor \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n34 Chronology of program development and processing is in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n\n \n\n\fconfidence  include  (i)  up-front  policy  decision  to  commit  to  the  reform  agenda,  (ii)  rigorous \nmonitoring  of  implementation  of  the  restructuring  process  to  meet  performance  benchmarks, \nand (iii) support to KVIC for supervision of good governance and program implementation. \n \n85.  Market  Response. The program impact will depend on successful implementation and \nmarket  response  to  products  of  supported  khadi  institutions.  While  the  Program  has  benefited \nfrom  successful  practices,  the  possibility  that  final  products,  at  least  initially,  may  not  find  a \npositive  market  response  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In  this  event,  the  reasons  will  have  to  be \nanalyzed and appropriately addressed. The Government also anticipates that adjusting to new \nbusiness  processes  and  market  expectations  could  take  time.  As  a  result,  the  Program  is \ndesigned as a pilot and all actions are phased. In addition, support to khadi institutions will be \nspread over a period of time to enable support throughout the adjustment process.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n86. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n87. \n \n\nProgram Implementation. The Government will, and will cause KVIC to \n\npromptly adopt and implement the policies and actions included in the Program \nas  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix;  and  ensure  that \nsuch  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  and  subsequent  to  the \nprogram period; \nfulfill the agreed policies and actions under the Program in accordance with the \nagreed implementation schedule, to ensure that the loan tranches are released in \na timely manner; and \nensure  that  all  activities,  documents,  and  enactments  required  under  the \nProgram will be prepared in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and their \nfeedback will be incorporated, as appropriate. \n \n\n88. \nIn  case  of  natural  calamities  and  unforeseen  circumstances  that  affect  the  equity  and \nliquidity of KVIC, the Government will immediately consult ADB and prepare a remedial action \nplan for the Program, acceptable to ADB. \n \n89. \n \n\nKhadi Policy Reforms. The Government will ensure that \n\nthe reforms under the Program, including institutional, legal, and financial reforms \nunder  the  khadi  reform  package  are  formulated,  finalized,  and  implemented  to \nthe satisfaction of ADB; and \n(a)  the  marketing  organization  to  be  established  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating \nproduct  development  and  marketing  of  khadi  products  will  be  incorporated \nthrough  a  joint  venture  between  KVIC  and  a  private  entity  with  KVIC  having  no \nmore  49%  of  the  shares,  and  (b)  at  least  50%  of  the  board  members  of  the \nmarketing  organization  should  be  independent  directors  who  are  renowned \nspecialists in their respective field.  \n\n \nPrior to the completion of the Program, the Government will cause KVIC to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n24 \n\n \n\n90. \n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n25\n\nreorganize  all  artisans  into  self-help  groups  and  proactively  provide  required \ntraining support to the group to enable them to constructively serve the purpose \nof the artisans; and  \nensure that (a) at least 50% of the governing board of a khadi institution will have \nrepresentation from the artisans, and (b) the criteria for the selection of the other \nmembers of the governing board will be based on good governance practices.  \n\n \n91.  Marketing Organization. KVIC will agree not to \n \n\nissue any discriminatory instructions or guidelines that may affect the access of \nthe  marketing  organization  to  (a)  any  khadi  institutions  and  their  sales  outlets, \nand  (b)  the  department  sales  outlets,  for  the  purpose  of  their  promotional  or \nmarketing ties, procurement  arrangements, wholesale, and export activities; and \ninfluence,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  business  decisions  of  the  khadi  institutions, \ndepartment  sales  outlets  or  other  agencies  with  regards  to  their  business \nactivities with the marketing organization. \n\n \nKVIC will \n\n92. \n \n\nprovide  the  marketing  organization  with  access  to  the  promotion  of  the  khadi \nmark and other trade marks registered under its name; \nprovide  support  and  facilitation  as  required  and  requested  by  the  marketing \norganization during the program implementation period; \nagree for the marketing organization to implement the marketing related reforms \nunder the program for the khadi institutions; and \nensure that all new department sales outlets will be established by the marketing \norganization. \n\n \nUpon the operationalization of the marketing organization, KVIC will utilize the bulk of its \n93. \nmarketing budget for promotional and developmental activities in a phased manner during the \nimplementation period of the program. \n \nCounterpart Funds. The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds will be used \n94. \nfor  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  introduced  under  the  Program  for  KVIC \nand  khadi  institutions  and  will  be  allocated  for  the  purpose  of  the  adjustment  costs  related  to \npolicy and institutional reforms, including khadi mark and synergy with village industries in the \namount  of  $48,000,000  (forty  eight  million  Dollars);  adjustment  costs  related  to  marketing \nreforms  in  the  amount  of  $27,000,000  (twenty  seven  million  Dollars);  and  adjustment  costs \nrelated  to  the  strengthening  of  khadi  institutions  in  the  amount  of  $75,000,000  (seventy  five \nmillion Dollars), and as further set out in the table in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n95. \nInformation  Sharing.  The  Government  will,  and  cause  KVIC  to  regularly  exchange \nviews and information with ADB on any problems and constraints encountered during program \nimplementation and seek proper resolution to address these problems and constraints. \n \nTechnical Assistance. The Government will, and cause KVIC to ensure that in carrying \n96. \nout the policy measures and activities included under the Program, the recommendations made \nunder the TA provided by ADB are duly considered for appropriate adoption in a timely manner \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nand in consultation with ADB.  \n\n \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Government  will,  and  will  cause  KVIC  to \n\n97. \nensure that \n\n \n\n\fall activities under the Program are carried out in accordance with all applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002); and \nunder  the  Program  no  people  will  be  (a)  adversely  affected  in  terms  of  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and (b) affected in terms of ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nPrior to the effectiveness of the loan, the Government will \n\nhave  complied  with  all  actions  relating  to  the  first  tranche  conditions,  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB; \nhave  constituted  a  reform  implementation  and monitoring  committee  to  oversee \nimplementation of the khadi reform package, to the satisfaction of ADB; \nhave established the RID, to the satisfaction of ADB; and \nhave appointed a director with qualifications and experience, acceptable to ADB, \nto head the RID. \n\nVIII.

\n\n \nA.  \n \nScope.  The  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNFS)  encompasses  all  nonagricultural  activities: \n1. \nmining  and  quarrying,  household  and  nonhousehold  manufacturing,  processing,  repair, \nconstruction,  trade  and  commerce,  transport,  and  other  services  in  villages  and  rural  towns \nundertaken by enterprises varying in size from household enterprises to factories.1 \n \n2. \nSignificance.  Literature  assessing  the  national  significance  of  the  RNFS  is  largely \nbased  on  employment  rather  than  contribution  to  gross  domestic  product.2 Of  an  estimated \nlabor force of 507 million in 2007, 380 million (76.4 %) are estimated to work in rural areas, with \nthe  majority  (about  290  million)  being  engaged  in  agriculture  and  allied  activities.  The  RNFS \nengages about 90 million, representing about 18% of the total workforce (Table A2.1).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Estimates of Population and Employment \n\n \nYear \nTotal Population (TP) \nTotal Labor Force (LF) \n\nTotal Employment (TE) \n\nRural Employment (RE) \nUrban Employment (UE) \n \nRural Nonfarm (RNF) \nRural Agriculture/Allied (RAA) \nTotal  Rural  Employment \n(TRE) \n\n2000 \n(million) \n1,004 \n406 \n\n397 \n\n304 \n93 \n \n72 \n232 \n\n304 \n\n2000 \nRatios \n\n0.40 (LF/TP)\n\n0.98 (TE/LF)\n\n0.77 (RE/TE)\n0.23 (UE/TE)\n\n \n\n0.24 (RNF/TRE)\n0.76 (RAA/TRE)\n\n1.00 \n\n2007 \n(million) \n1,113 \n507 \n\n496 \n\n380 \n116 \n \n90 \n290 \n\n380 \n\n2007 \nRatios \n \n\n0.46 (LF/TP) \n\n0.98 (TE/LF) \n\n0.77 (RE/TE) \n0.23 (UE/TE) \n\n \n0.24 (RNF/TRE) \n0.76 (RAA/TRE) \n\n1.00 \n\nSources: Estimates based on Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation.

The significance of policy interventions in the RNFS arises from \nthe asymmetry in the population residing in rural areas (72%) and the decreasing contribution of \nagriculture  and  allied  activities  to  gross  domestic  product  (currently  18%).  The  declining \nemployment elasticity of agriculture suggests that policy interventions need to focus on creating \nopportunities  in  the  nonfarm  sector  where  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  can  absorb  the \n\n                                                 \n1  Jha,  Brajesh.  2006.

The focus of most policy interventions in the RNFS has been on \ngenerating employment, enhancing productivity, and catalyzing the flow of credit to the sector.  \n \n5. \nRNFS  employment  is  particularly  relevant  to  landless  laborers,  farmers  with  small \nlandholdings,  and  the  socioeconomically  marginalized.  Recently,  the  Government  has  also \nemphasized the potential of the informal sector to spur growth. In this context, the significance \nof  the  RNFS,  thus,  arises  from  (i)  employment,  (ii)  growth,  (iii)  urban  migration,  and  (iv) \ndistributional  and  social  justice  perspectives.  The  RNFS  holds  potential  to  generate  rural \nemployment,  enhance  rural  incomes,  address  rural  poverty,  and  tackle  issues  of  unequal \nincome distribution through inclusive growth.  \n \n6. \nInstitutional  Landscape.  The  institutional  landscape  that  characterizes  the  RNFS  is \nprovided  in  Figure  A2.  Over  the  years,  especially  after  the  1970s,  numerous  institutions  have \nbeen established under different ministries with the mandate to bring about development, create \nfacilitating  conditions  to  develop  village  industries,  enhance  productivity,  and  generate \nemployment  in  the  RNFS.  Lack  of  coordination  among  these  institutions  has  resulted  in \noverlapping mandates. \n \nAgencies such as the district rural development agencies5 and district industries centers6 \n7. \nwere created in every district and have considerable infrastructure. After nationalization, banks \nhave been actively involved in the RNFS and associated with government schemes. Financing \nand  policy-making  organizations  such  as  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment7 and the Small Industries Development Bank of India have a major nonfarm sector \nfocus  across  India.  The  Small  Industries  Development  Bank  was  established  in  1990  to \npromote,  finance,  and  develop  small-scale  industries  and  coordinate  the  functions  of  other \ninstitutions  engaged  in  similar  activities.  Its  current  mission  is  to  empower  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  economic  growth,  employment \ngeneration, and balanced regional development. \n \n8. \nThe  Council  for  Advancement  of  People's  Action  and  Rural  Technology,  established  in \n1986, works as a nodal agency for catalyzing and coordinating partnerships between voluntary \norganizations  and  the  Government  for  sustainable  development  of  rural  areas.  Examples  of \nother  corporations  established  in  the  RNFS  include  the  Handicraft  Development  Corporation, \nLeather Development Corporation, and Minor Forest Products Corporation.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5  The  district  rural  development  agencies  were  put  in  place  in  the  1970s  as  specialized  professional  agencies \ncapable  of  managing  the  antipoverty  programs  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  and  effectively  relating  the \nschemes to the overall effort of poverty reduction in the districts. \n\n6  The  district  industries  centers  were  set  up  after  1977  to  promote  district  and  grassroots  small-scale,  village,  and \ncottage  industries.  These  were  headed  by  general  managers.  The  Khadi  and  Village  Industries  Commission  is \nrepresented in their committees. \n\n7  The  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD)  was  established  in  1981  as  an  apex \ndevelopment bank  with  a mandate for facilitating credit flow  for  promotion and development of agriculture, small-\nscale  industries,  cottage  and  village  industries,  handicrafts,  and  other  rural  crafts.  It  also  has  the  mandate  to \nsupport  all  other  allied  economic  activities  in  rural  areas,  promote  integrated  and  sustainable  rural  development, \nand  secure  prosperity  of  rural  areas.  NABARD  also  provides  refinancing  to  lending  institutions  in  rural  areas, \npromotes  institutional  development,  and  acts  as  a  coordinator  in  the  operations  of  rural  credit  institutions.  In \naddition, NABARD provides advice to government and other organizations in matters related to rural development; \nand  offers  training  and  research  facilities  to  banks,  cooperatives,  and  organizations  working  in  the  field  of  rural \ndevelopment.  NABARD  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Rural  Cooperative  Credit \nRestructuring and Development Program. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Appendix 2             35 \n\n \n\nNGOs, Cooperatives, \n \nTrusts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResearch and Extension \n \nGovernment Departments \nResearch Institutions \nTechnical & Design \nInstitutions \n\nCharacteristics  of  the  RNFS.

Broadly, khadi refers to \na hand-spun, handwoven cloth whereas village industries such as pottery, handicrafts, leather, \nblack  smithy,  carpentry,  various  processed  foods  and  condiments,  cane  and  bamboo  craft, \ngoods made from various plant fibers refer to small and microenterprises in any industry located \nin  rural  areas  that  produce  any  goods  or  renders  any  service  with  or  without  use  of  power,  in \nwhich  fixed  capital  investment  (in  plant,  machinery,  land,  and  building)  per  artisan  or  worker \ndoes not exceed a specific amount.   \n \n11. \nConsistent  statistics  related  to  KVI  are  not  available.  What  is  available  is  information \nrelated  to  the  programs  of  the  Khadi  and  Village  Industries  Commission  (KVIC),  which  is  the \napex  body  to  catalyze  KVI  growth.  The  KVIC-aided  subsector  is  unique  in  the  sense  that  it \ncarries  an  emotive  content  as  it  was  linked  to  India\u2019s  freedom  and  is  based  on  Gandhian \nthought. Today, the values underpinning the khadi concept has gained impetus in the context of \n(i)  the  recent  global  environment  movement  and  the  emphasis  on  green,  sustainable,  and \nethical  livelihoods;  and  (ii)  the  realization  of  the  importance  of  the  informal  sector  in  spurring \neconomic growth.  \n \n12.  Most  KVI  have  limited  access  to  institutional  credit;  the  outstanding  credit  to  village \nartisans is estimated to represent less than 1% of bank credit. Their share between 1990 and \n2005  declined  from  0.9%  to  0.6%.8 Even  more  apparent  is  the  decline  in  the  number  of  bank \naccounts of village artisans from 2.2 million accounts in 1990 to 1.3 million in 2005. \n \n13. \nThe village industries program, currently a focus of the Government\u2019s Rural Employment \nGeneration  Programme  (REGP),  has  emerged  as  its  flagship  program.  REGP  targets  have \nbeen  consistently  exceeded  in  the  past  few  years  and  it  is  perceived  as  one  of  the  few  fairly \nsuccessful  employment  generation  schemes  on  the  basis  of  targets  achieved,  sustainable \nemployment generated, and bank loan recoveries from beneficiaries. In the process, however, \nits focus on traditional village industries and rural artisans has gradually been diluted.  \n \nKVIC  was  set  up  in  April  1957  as  a  statutory  body.9 It  traces  its  origins  to  the  khadi \n14. \ninstitutions,  the  primary  producers  and  marketers  of  khadi  that  were  largely  constituted  as \nnongovernment organizations in the 1920s.10 KVIC is among the earliest agencies set up with \nthe  mandate  to  catalyze  the  nonfarm  sector,  generate  employment,  and  create  sustainable \nlivelihoods. The purpose of promoting the KVI subsector was to promote local resource-based \nproducts  and  traditional  crafts  in  rural  areas.11 The  objectives  of  KVIC  include  (i)  the  social \nobjective  of  providing  employment,  (ii)  the  economic  objective  of  producing  saleable  articles, \nand  (iii)  the  wider  objective  of  creating  self-reliance  among  the  poor  and  building  up  a  strong \nrural community spirit.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector. 2007. Report on Financing of Enterprises in the \n\nUnorganized Sector and Creation of a National Fund for the Unorganized Sector. New Delhi. \n\n9  KVIC was established by an Act of Parliament (1956). It commenced operations in April 1957 when it took over the \nwork of the former All India Khadi and Village Industries Board. The KVIC Act was amended in 1987, 1989, 1994, \nand 2006.  \n\n10 The All India Khadi Samiti was set up by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1923, The All India Spinners\u2019 Association \nor the Akhil Bharatiya Charkha Sangh was set up in 1925 followed by the All India Village Industries Association. \n11 Rural area in this context is any area classified as village as per the revenue records of the state, irrespective of \n\npopulation. This includes areas classified as town but with a population of 20,000 or less.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Appendix 2             37 \n\nof \n\n(iii) \n\nkhadi \n\nregistration \n\nformulation, \n\nand  monitoring \n\nThe Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises currently administers KVIC.12 KVIC \n15. \nmanages its programs through a central office in Mumbai and regional offices in 36 states. The \nstate  offices  are  responsible  for  implementing  the  KVIC  program  and  monitoring  the  program \nthrough interaction with state KVI boards (KVIB). The day-to-day operations are handled by the \nchief  executive  officer  and  six  zonal  deputy  chief  executive  officers.  KVIC  has  separate \ndirectorate positions for khadi, village industries, and REGP to maintain focus on activities.  \n \n16. \nKVIC\u2019s interventions are essentially geared to removing barriers to rural livelihoods, i.e., \nissues of human capital (capacity building), access to appropriate technology, financial (access \nto  credit),  location  barriers  (infrastructure  and  connectivity),  market  access,  and  institutional \nbarriers  of  policy  and  practice.  Overall,  the  focus  of  KVIC  is  to  create  facilitating  conditions  to \ngenerate rural employment, make rural entrepreneurs competitive, create self-reliance, build a \nstrong  community  spirit,  promote  local  resource-based  products  and  traditional  crafts,  and \nadminister  government  programs.  KVIC\u2019s  current  role  comprises  (i)  development  and \nimplementation  of  schemes  targeted  at  institutions  registered  with  KVIC  and  state  KVIBs,  (ii) \npolicy \ninstitutions,  \n(iv)  production  and  procurement  of  raw  materials  and  distribution  to  producers,  (v)  promotion \nand marketing of KVI products, (vi) human resource development through training, (vii) research \nand  development,  and  (viii)  financing  of  eligible  KVI  institutions  (presently  only  to  village \nindustries through the REGP).  \n \n17. \nKVIC  interventions  are  now  being  refocused  to  a  cluster-based  approach  to  better \nleverage  the  efficacy  of  the  interventions.  The  KVIC  program  for  implementing  its  objectives \ncomprises  KVIC\u2019s  policy  schemes:  (i)  khadi  program,  including  raw  material  procurement, \nmarketing, cost chart, financial assistance in the form of rebates, and interest rate subsidies; (ii) \nvillage  industries  programs,  including  the  Rural  Industry  Service  Center,  which  supports \nupgrading  of  production  capacity,  market  promotion,  and  skills  development;  and  the  Rural \nEmployment Generation Programme,13 which provides margin money subsidy for setting up an \nenterprise  in  rural  areas  with  a  population  less  than  20,000;  (iii)  programs  for  both  khadi  and \nvillage  industries,  including  the  Scheme  of  Funding  for  Regeneration  of  Traditional  Industries, \nwhich supports integrated development of traditional khadi, coir, and village industries, including \nleather  and  pottery,  based  on  a  cluster  approach;  and  the  Product  Development  Design \nIntervention and Packaging Scheme, which is to improve quality and develop new product lines; \n(iv) training; and (v) research and development. The KVI program is implemented through 5,549 \nregistered  institutions,  33  state  KVIBs,  about  30,000  cooperative  societies,  27  public  sector \nbanks,  regional  rural  banks,  a  few  selected  cooperative  banks,  and  nearly  262,000  REGP \nentrepreneurs.  \n \n18. \nKVIC is the national government body for khadi and is involved in producing khadi inputs \nand  marketing  khadi  products  (through  its  own  outlets).  KVIC  provides  training,  research,  and \ndevelopment  support  to  khadi  institutions.  For  village  industries,  KVIC  implements  village \nindustry  programs  along  with  other  agencies  under  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  and \nMinistry of Forest Development. Of the total KVI products sold under the KVIC program, 0.26% \nare  sold  through  marketing  outlets  and  the  balance  through  outlets  owned  and  managed  by \nkhadi  and  village  institutions  and  entrepreneurs  (under  the  KVIC  program).  The  KVIC  state \noffices  and  KVIBs  facilitate  implementation  in  the  states.  KVIBs  are  state  government  bodies; \n\n                                                 \n12 The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 became effective on 2 October 2006. It governs \n\nthe promotion and development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.   \n\n13 Margin money subsidy from the Government is 25% up to Rs1 million for the project cost and an additional 10% for \n\nthe balance of the cost up to Rs2.5 million. The balance of the project cost is financed by bank loans. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbecause  of  their  grassroots  reach,  they  are  important  agencies  for  implementing  the  KVIC \nprogram.  In  addition,  some  of  the  proactive  state  governments  launch  promotional  schemes \nwithin their states, which are implemented by KVIBs. The state governments fund administrative \nexpenses of KVIBs and KVIC funds the implementation of KVI programs by KVIBs. \n \n19. \nKVIC has catalyzed capital formation exceeding Rs78 billion in the RNFS, and its aided \nenterprises have generated livelihoods for more than 9 million people. In FY2006, KVIC-aided \nenterprises  had  sales  exceeding  Rs175  billion.  The  compound  annual  growth  rate  from \nFY1994\u2013FY2006 for production was 13.1% and for sales 15.1%. The overall production of KVI \ngoods and services increased to Rs140.2 billion (13.28%) and sales to Rs175.6 billion (14.97%) \nin FY2006 from the previous year. The growth was largely on account of the village industries. \nTotal  employment  registered  with  KVIC  and  the  KVIBs  also  increased  from  5.2  million  in \nFY1994 to 9 million in FY2006, of which about 90% are employed in village industries.  \n \n20. \nStrengthening  KVI  Subsector.  The  performance  of  KVI  subsector  and  KVIC  is \nreviewed  from  time  to  time.  The  prominent  reviews  include  The  KVI  Review  Committee  (M. \nRamakrishnayya)  1987  resulting  in  the  definition  of  village  industries  being  changed;  the  High \nPower  Committee  constituted  under  the  chairmanship  of  then  Prime  Minister  Mr.  P.  V. \nNarasimha Rao (1994) resulting in the introduction of the REGP program; the Arthur Andersen \nReport  (2000)  addressing  the  organization  structure  of  KVIC;  the  KC  Pant  Report  (2001) \nresulting in the development of a marketing body; and the Confederation for Promotions of KVI; \nand  the  Expert  Committee  Report  (D.M.  Sukthankar)  2005,  which  identified  the  need  for \nchanges in KVIC\u2019s structure and functioning and recommended measures to revamp the KVIC. \n \nC.  \n \n21. \nKhadi  institutions,  or  the  primary  producers  and  marketers  of  khadi,  are  registered  as \ncharitable  societies14 or  public  charitable  trusts,  and  are  affiliated15 with  either  KVIC  or  KVIBs. \nKhadi institutions are rural based and engaged in production (hand spinning of cotton sliver, silk, \nor  wool;  hand  reeling  of  silk  into  yarn;  handloom  weaving  of  yarn  into  fabric;  processing  for \nfinishing;  garment  making) 16  and  retailing  and  marketing  of  khadi  products.  Some  khadi \ninstitutions  are  integrated  into  the  production  of  raw  material  from  cotton.  Of  the  1,952  khadi \ninstitutions, only 64 are exclusively trading institutions; all the others are engaged in production \nas well as retailing/marketing of khadi.  \n \nThe  size  of  the  current  market  for  khadi  is  difficult  to  precisely  assess  since  machine-\n22. \nmade textiles are also spuriously sold as khadi. Khadi produced under the KVIC khadi program, \nsold through 7,050 khadi institution sales outlets and 11 direct sales outlets of KVIC, grew 2% in \nvolume and 3% in value during FY2002\u2013FY2006. In FY2006, production increased by 4.9% and \nsales  by  5.5%.  These  figures  do  not  include  hand-spun  and  woven  khadi  sold  by  around  90 \noutlets  of  Fabindia,  and  other  private  enterprises  for  which  data  is  not  available.  Nearly  two \nthirds of the market is for cotton khadi. Overall, khadi is estimated to constitute less than 1% of \nthe  textile  market  in  India.  In  contrast,  the  overall  textile  market  has  expanded  rapidly  and \nchanged  in  composition  as  the  economy  has  grown.  Total  textile  production  increased  at  a \n\nKhadi  \n\n                                                 \n14  The societies are based on respective state societies registration acts (1860). \n15  1,252  are  affiliated  with  KVIC,  and  700  with  the  KVIBs.  Delhi,  Himachai  Pradesh,  Punjub,  Jharkhand,  the \nnortheastern states, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh have no institutions affiliated to \nKVIB. Goa, Tripura, and Mizoram have no khadi institutions.  \n\n16  In  addition  to  cotton,  silk,  and  wool,  polyvastra  (polyester\u2013cotton  khadi  mix)  is  also  produced  under  the  KVIC \n\nprogram.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Appendix 2             39 \n\ncompound  growth  rate  of  7%  (in  volume)  and  15%  (in  value)  during  FY2002\u2013FY2006. \nIncreasingly  urban  and  higher  and  middle  income  class  consumers  are  becoming  aware  of \nquality  and  fashion  trends.  In  the  more  price  sensitive  lower  income  segments,  synthetics  are \nreplacing cotton textiles. \n  \n23. \nCotton  khadi  production  is  preeminent  in  Uttar  Pradesh;  West  Bengal  and  Tamil  Nadu \nare  the  principal  silk  khadi  producers;  and  Haryana,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  Rajasthan  the  main \nproducers of woolen khadi (Table A2.3). \n \n24. \nIt is estimated that khadi accounts for 10%\u201312% of KVI employment, or nearly 1 million. \nKhadi provides rural employment in hand spinning (cotton, wool, and silk), hand reeling of silk, \nhandloom  weaving,  processing  of  fabric,  and  garment  making.  Semi-skilled  (principally \nspinners)  and  skilled  (principally  weavers)  artisans  employed  by  khadi  Institutions  are  the \nbackbone  of  the  khadi  production  workforce.  Nonartisans  are  categorized  as  \u201cother,\u201d  which \nincludes  secretary,  sales,  and  administrative  personnel.  Spinning  provides  employment  to  the \nlargest  number  79%,  followed  by  weaving  and  fabric  processing  12%,  and  others  9%.  Almost \n80% of spinners are women. The high participation of women is considered an affirmation that \nspinning is a subsidiary activity and that it is sought by people less able to migrate in search of \nwork or less able to work outdoors due to social customs. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Top Four Khadi-Producing States \n \n\n \nRank \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n\nCotton Khadi \nState (Share %) \n\nWool Khadi \nState (Share %) \n\nUttar Pradesh (45.36)  Haryana (23.48) \nTamil Nadu (8.59) \nGujarat (6.74) \nHaryana (6.41) \n\nUttar Pradesh (19.12) \nRajasthan (18.46) \nKarnataka (10.20) \n\nSilk Khadi \nState (Share %) \nWest Bengal (31.48) \nTamil Nadu (31.02) \nKarnataka (7.69) \nGujarat (6.13) \n\n \n\n          Source: Khadi and Village Industries Commission Annual Report 2006\u20132007. \n \n25. \nArtisan earnings from conversion are less than satisfactory. The average annual wages \nin  FY2006 were  Rs2,555  for  cotton,  Rs3,143 for  wool,  and  Rs8,141  for  silk.  Wages  for cotton \nand wool workers are less than the official poverty line of Rs4,275 for rural areas.17 The wage \nbreakdown  by  each  category  of  work  is  (i)  spinners:  Rs822  for  cotton,  Rs1,070  for  wool,  and \nRs3.035 for silk, (ii) weavers: Rs7,380 for cotton, Rs7,665 for wool and Rs12,141 for silk, and \n(iii)  others:  Rs13,932  for  cotton,  Rs15,091  for  wool,  and  Rs23,380  for  silk.  The  earnings  of \nspinners  across  product  categories  are  much  lower  than  the  earnings  of  weavers  and  others. \nCotton  spinners,  in  particular,  earn  only  Rs822  a  year  on  average  or  less  than  Rs69  a  month \nfrom  khadi  spinning.  Findings  from  interactions  with  spinners  (Rajasthan  and  Tamil  Nadu) \nindicate that daily wages for cotton khadi hover around Rs30\u2013Rs40.18 Assuming a wage rate of \nRs30 a day, the full-time employment days of cotton spinners works out to 27.4 days, less than \n1 month a year.  \n\n                                                 \n17 Official poverty line for the urban area is Rs6,463. \n18  While local wages in rural areas vary widely across regions and during the year, the peak rate during the farming \nseason is around Rs30 even in the poorest regions.

Accordingly,  this  assessment  takes  a  risk-based \napproach  to,  and  an  institutional  focus  on,  implementation  of  the  Khadi  Reform  and \nDevelopment Program (the Program).  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nTo support, strengthen, and expand initiatives to create mass rural employment, the All \nIndia Khadi and Village Industries Board was set up in 1953 and subsequently, the Khadi and \nVillage  Industries  Commission  (KVIC)  was  created  by  an  act  of  Parliament  in  1956.  KVIC \nfunctions  are  under  the  administrative  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises  (MMSME).  Following  the  setting  up  of  KVIC,  the  state  governments  established \nstate khadi and village industries boards (KVIB) under acts passed by the state legislatures to \nimplement  the  KVIC  program  as  well  as  other  khadi  and  village  industries  programs  in  their \nrespective territories. KVIC and the KVIBs implement the KVIC program through affiliated khadi \ninstitutions.  Khadi  institutions  are  constituted  as  charitable  societies  or  public  charitable  trusts \nunder  state  laws.  They  are  rural  based  and  engaged  in  production  and  retailing  and/or \nmarketing of khadi and village industries products. Of the 5,549 registered under KVIC or KVIB, \n1,952 are exclusively engaged in production as well as retailing of khadi.  \n \n3. \nGovernance and risk issues with respect to reform of production and marketing of khadi \ncan  be  categorized  under  policy  framework,  institutional  dimensions,  and  accountability  and \ntransparency. \n \n4. \nPolicy Framework. KVIC is the nodal institution for reform of production and marketing \nof  khadi.  Given  the  enormous  inclusive  development,  employment,  and  income-generating \nscope  of  khadi,  KVIC  has  significant  responsibilities  to  discharge.  Since  1987,  review  of  the \nworking  of  KVIC  has  been  undertaken  from  time  to  time.  However,  efforts  to  operationalize \nthese  were  fragmented.  KVIC  needs  to  recapture  its  original  role  as  a  promotional  and \ndevelopment agency and facilitator for production of quality consumer products. \n \n5. \nInstitutional Dimensions. The establishment of khadi institutions is in accordance with \neither the Society Registration Act 1860, Indian Trust Act 1882, or the cooperative society act of \neach state. The governing board of a typical khadi institution could comprise a chief executive \nofficer,  secretary,  representative  of  owners,  and  artisans. However,  in  many  khadi  institutions, \nartisan representation is nominal and minor, and the overall governance is weak. Management \nof these institutions has paid scarce attention to improving working conditions of artisans.  \n \n6. \nAccountability  and  Transparency.  KVIC  classifies  khadi  institutions  on  the  basis  of \ntheir operating status, excluding governance-related parameters. Further, KVIC does not have a \nspecific policy for restructuring nonperforming khadi institutions. Currently, about 270 institutions \nare underperforming, and KVIC is continuing to provide financial support to them. No effective \nmeasures  have  been  introduced  to  resolve  the  difficulties  of  the  nonperforming  khadi \ninstitutions. Dilution in representation of artisans has weakened the governance, accountability, \nand transparency of these institutions. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRisks and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\nB. \n \n7. \nUnderlying  Assumptions.  The  main  assumptions  in  the  risk  analysis  are  that  (i)  the \nGovernment  will  stay  the  course  in  its  objective  of  reforming  the  KVI  subsector,  particularly \nkhadi,  and  the  political  commitment  to  attain  it;  (ii)  the  reforms  sought  will  materialize  and  be \nsustained in the immediate future; (iii) effective institution building in key agencies will continue; \nand (iv) the KVIBs will support the proposed reforms of khadi institutions. \n\n1. \n\nRisk Specification \n\n8. \nPolicy  and  Implementation  Risks. Despite  the Government\u2019s  successful  track  record \nof  reforms  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  village  industries,  the  longer  time  for \nbuilding consensus to reform the production and marketing of khadi reflects the likely difficulties \nin pursing the reform agenda. In addition, the reform hierarchy involving participants all the way \ndown  to  the  grassroots  could  slow  the  momentum  of  reforms.  KVIC\u2019s  commitment  as  the \nProgram implementing agency and KVIB\u2019s support are essential. These risks are dealt with in \npart by front loading the conditions relating to policy reform and implementation framework. \n \n9. \nAccountability  and  Transparency  Risks.  Currently,  KVIC  and  its  zonal  and  state \noffices  have  no  staffing  norms,  resulting  in  significant  variations  in  deployment  of  staff.  At  the \nsame  time,  current  roles  of  KVIC  directorates  or  divisions  in  the  existing  KVIC  organization \nstructure are not adequately identified and need to be reviewed. Moreover, the existing role of \nzonal offices is limited to monitoring information flow from the KVIC state offices to KVIC head \noffice.  No  information  system  roadmap  has  been  developed  and  KVIC\u2019s  information  and \ndatabase system management is inadequate. The present management information system at \nKVIC  does  not  entirely  comprehend  and  link  product  information  and  the  institutions  that \nproduce products. Thus, internal accountability remains weak.  \n \n10. \nInstitutional  Risks.  The reforms supported by the Program, including the restructuring \nof  khadi  institutions  and  KVIC  itself,  require  understanding  of  the  new  policy  measures  to \nsupport  khadi,  the  expected  changes  in  business  processes,  and  the  required  skill  sets  to \nimplement these. Central and local government officials, KVIC staff, and khadi institutions might \nhave  difficulty  orienting  to  market-linked  strategies,  declining  financial  assistance,  and  private \nsector  professionalism  in  marketing.  The  new  business  processes  supported  by  the  Program \nrequire different skill sets that long-serving KVIC staff might not have. \n \n11. \nProgram Management. In implementing programs, delays are caused predominantly by \nlack  of  technical  expertise  and  of  the  consensus-building  approach  needed  to  enact  laws  and \nregulations. Further, staff behavior could prove resistant to institutional and governance reforms, \nthereby undermining expected performance improvements.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRisk Severity \n\nTable  A10.1  on  the  next  page  shows  the  degree  of  severity  of  these  and  other  risks.1 \n\n \n12. \nNote that type 1 risks are the most severe, followed by types II and III.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The degree of severity is calculated by the product of the range of likelihood of the risk occurring and the potential \n\nimpact of such a risk. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n61\n\nTable A10.1.

Reform  of  the  RNFS,  in \nparticular  khadi  and  village  industries,  has  thus  emerged  as  a  strategic  priority  of  the \nGovernment. The Program provides significant opportunities for enhancing RNFS employment \nand increasing incomes, especially for women, empowering the rural population in communities \nwith  opportunities  to  meaningfully  participate  in,  and  benefit  from,  economic  growth.  The \nProgram attempts to manage sector-specific and program-related risks in a systematic manner. \nSome of the mitigating measures for the primary risks can be seen in Table A10.2. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988  tries  to  address  the  issue  of \ncorruption  in  general;  and  the  Government  has  recently  initiated  a  review  of  existing  conduct \nrules specified for members of central and all India services, and training of officials performing \nthe vigilance function in ministries, departments, and public sector enterprises. Efforts to make \nthis review more relevant and in line with best international practices is ongoing.  \n \n\nControls for Corruption at the Sector and Program Level \n\n \n)\nL\n(\n \ng\nn\ni\nr\nr\nu\nc\nc\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nv\ne\n \nf\no\nd\no\no\nh\n\n \n\ni\nl\ne\nk\ni\nL\n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n15. \nOther steps under the Program to mitigate corruption include (i) conducting independent \naudits of khadi institutions eligible for support under the Program, (ii) reforming the governance \nstructure of khadi institutions for artisan empowerment by modifying the categorization norms as \nwell as through new khadi ventures, (iii) conducting random spot audits for khadi institutions on \nlicensing requirements for the khadi mark, and (iv) implementing institutional reforms of KVIC. \nIndependent  audit  of  khadi  institutions  will  reduce  vulnerability  to  corruption.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nDespite recent rapid economic growth, poverty in India is still substantial. According to the National Sample Survey, 27.5% of \nthe population, or nearly 302 million people, were living below the poverty line. About 72% of the poor live in rural areas and \nmost  depend  on  subsistence  farming  for  their  livelihood.  Among  them,  59%  are  small  landholders,  marginal  farmers,  and \nlandless labors; and two thirds of agricultural laborers are women. Poverty in India is partly attributed to the overconcentration \nof  the  work  force  in  the  agriculture  sector,  with  corresponding  low  productivity.  In  2007,  about  56%  of  the  total  population \ndepended  on  agriculture,  while  agriculture  contributed  18%  to  the  gross  national  product. To  increase  opportunities  in  rural \nareas,  and  enhance  agricultural  productivity  concomitantly,  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNFS)  must  provide  economic \nopportunities  for  poor  men  and  women.  Poor  households  value  nonagricultural  incomes  because  they  increase  incomes  at \nthe  margin  as  well  as  minimize  risk  through  diversification.  Moreover,  an  expanding  nonfarm  sector  can  help  to  reduce \npoverty  even  for  those  poor  not  directly  employed  off-farm  by  tightening  village  labor  markets  and  raising  wage  rates  for \nagriculture  laborers.  The  Khadi  Reform  and  Development  Program  (the  Program)  aims  to  improve  social  and  economic \nwelfare of low-skilled artisans and workers who are employed in khadi and village industries to enhance returns and earnings \npotential  through  comprehensive  sector  restructuring  efforts  including  governance,  marketing,  and  institutional  reforms. The \nProgram  also  expects  to  increase  employment  opportunities  for  poor  rural  households  as  a  result  of  extensive  capacity \ndevelopment and empowerment support. \n \nThe Program is in line with the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, which advocates inclusive growth by creating productive \nemployment opportunities and reducing poverty in rural areas. The Government recognizes that the RNFS is a major inclusive \nemployment generation sector. Reform of the RNFS, in particular khadi and village industries (KVI), has thus emerged as a \nstrategic  government  priority.  Along  with  sustainable  economic  growth  and  good  governance,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  prioritizes  inclusive  social  development  as  a  key  priority  of  ADB  operations.  The  Program  is  in  line  with \nrecommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for  India,  which  advocates  that  ADB  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment for poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Program are an estimated 1 million households engaged in khadi and 8 million households \ndrawing their sustenance from village industries. Most khadi artisans (spinners) are  women. An initial assessment identified \nthat most of them are poor, disadvantaged, and local residents. About one third of KVI workers belong to low and scheduled \ncastes. More than 60% are either illiterate or have up to primary education. Workers\u2019 earnings based on conversion charges \nare not sufficient for them to cross the poverty line. This is mainly due to current low productivity and low return in khadi. The \nProgram  will  address the low income  and  underemployment issues by revitalizing khadi. Khadi production, as an  economic \nactivity, is geographically widespread, and encompasses all states and regions. Hence, its poverty impact will be widespread \nand will cover the country\u2019s poorest states, and those with low human development and social indicators. \n \nThe  direct  benefit  of  the  Program  will  be  extended  to  those  engaged  in  KVI,  including  low-skilled  artisans,  spinners,  and \nlaborers,  who  will receive increased incomes and employment opportunities as a result of improved productivity of KVI and \neconomic return as the result of the reform. As KVI subsector holds greater employment potential for women, the Program will \nbenefit mostly poor rural women. Khadi is produced by institutions generally run by nongovernment organizations (NGO). The \nNGOs  will  also  benefit  as  their  institutions  will  emerge  more  productive  and  sustainable  as  a  result  of  the  reforms.  The \nProgram  will  yield  social  and  economic  benefits  to  the  broader  rural  poor  population  in  India.  The  revitalization  of  KVI \nsubsector will result in better wages for the agriculture and nonagriculture sectors. The reforms will also have positive spin offs \nin terms of helping reduce nonincome poverty. A study of KVIa clearly noted that increases in incomes of KVI households led \nto a change in the expenditure pattern of the households in favor of nonmaterial consumption, such as education and health. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n2.  Design Features \nThe  Program  will  expand  the  rural  employment  base  by  providing  comprehensive  reform  support  including  policy  reform, \npromotion and marketing, creation of an enabling business environment, procurement and production reform, financial reform, \nand  capacity  development.  Each  reform  activity  will  have  a  strong  pro-poor  gender-sensitive  focus.  For  example,  for  policy \nreform,  participatory  consultations  were  conducted  with  civil  society,  NGOs,  and  community  organizations  to  inform  all \nconcerned  about  the  process  and  potential  implications  of  the  reform  and  during  the  implementation,  further  participatory \nconsultations  will  be  carried  out  to  have  an  inter-active  program  monitoring  and  assessment  (Section  II.B).  The  Program \nincludes  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  provide  extensive  capacity  development  support  for  skills  enhancement  and \nempowerment, and participation in governance by beneficiaries, especially female artisans. \n\n \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\ngroups affected. \n\n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \n\n \nThe  KVI  subsector  has  great  potential  for  generating  gainful  employment  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor,  decreasing \nmigration  of  rural  unskilled  workers  to  urban  areas,  and  promoting  sustainable  development.  The  Program  will  generate \ndirect  poverty  reduction  impacts  for  the  rural  poor,  especially  low-skilled  khadi  workers,  by  enhancing  returns  from  khadi \nactivities  and  providing  more  substantial  and  sustainable  employment  opportunities.  The  home-based  nature  of  khadi \nactivities  is  especially  suited  for  women  and  the  income  and  employment  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  most  accrued  by \npoor  rural  women.  The  Program  is  also  expected  to  have  an  indirect  poverty  impact  including  empowerment  of  the  rural \npoor by  developing their bargaining  power, creating self-reliance among rural communities, and revitalizing the rural  labor \nmarket for more competitive wages in agriculture and nonagriculture sectors. Higher  wages and higher input costs will be \nviable  due  to  marketing  reforms  and  overall  higher  revenues  expected  from  increased  sales  due  to  greater  market \npenetration. Specifically, by program completion, the Program envisages that (i) the earnings of the existing khadi artisans \nwill increase because of increased production, minimum wage standards, and reduced underemployment; and (ii) additional \nemployment opportunities will be created, largely for women. \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis). \n \nThe main target beneficiaries of the Program are khadi artisans and workers, including women, socially disadvantaged, and \nthose residing in ecologically  fragile terrain (Section I.B). The  Program  will support inclusive growth as it is spread across \nthe  country,  encompassing  poorer  states,  and  remote  and  dispersed  areas.  As  the  reform  does  not  envisage  any  labor \nretrenchment,  it  will  not  have  any  adverse  labor  impact.  In  addition,  the  TA\u2019s  gender  development  specialist  will  identify \ngender-related issues and develop measures to enhance positive impacts and mitigate negative impacts on gender-specific \nmatters.  \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium Development \n\nGoals. \n\nThe Program\u2019s reform package is based on the primary concept of providing sustainable off-farm employment opportunities \nfor the rural poor. The Program includes a pro-poor focus for all reform activities. The policy reform will develop an enabling \npolicy  framework  to  improve  the  incomes  and  empowerment  of  artisans.  The  marketing  and  production  efficiency \nimprovement  will  result  in  better  returns  and  benefits  for  low-skilled  workers,  and  institutional  reform  activities  will  include \nsubstantial  capacity  development  support  for  the  poor  to  diversify  their  sources  of  incomes  and  improve  employment \nopportunities  in  the  RNFS.  Given  the  high  income  elasticity  of  demand,  the  textile  market  has  expanded  rapidly  as  the \neconomy has grown and has changed in composition. Khadi production under the Khadi and Village Industries Commission \n(KVIC)  program  has  slowed  (but  not  declined),  2%  in  volume  and  3%  in  value.  Hence,  the  reform  package  proposes \nenhance the positive growth by making marketing more professionally managed and in the process enhancing incomes and \nemployment.  The  Program  will  have  contributions  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  to  eradicate  extreme  poverty  and \nhunger, and promote gender equality and empowerment of women. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIn general, poverty is the result of low assets, combined with low and uncertain returns. The poor are concentrated in low-paid \ncasual daily wage work; most own little or no land or productive assets. Poor people lack marketable skills and, in most cases, \nliteracy. They are ill-equipped to take advantage of opportunities provided by economic growth. The rural poor in India survive \nfrom  the  marginal  returns  of  farming,  but  have  limited  opportunities  to  diversify  their  income  sources.  The  Program  will \nenhance rural nonfarm economic activities through the proposed reforms. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n65\n\n  \nLow  skills  and  limited  access  to  productive  social  and  physical  infrastructure  are  the  primary  constraints  for  the  rural  poor \nincluding  those  employed  in  khadi,  especially  women.  The  Program  will  provide  capacity  development  support  to  upgrade \ntheir skills to adopt improved technologies. In addition, the Program will carry out participatory poverty analysis at the onset of \nthe Program to identify constraints and needs of the poor, and develop strategies to address their issues in a gender-focused \nmanner. The poverty analysis will be reviewed and reflected in the program design throughout program implementation. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \n \nSeveral  stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  Program.  Key  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  program  preparation,  including \nartisans, producer groups, Government, NGOs, and private sector. Interactions with the various stakeholders include \n \n\n(i)  assessment  and  participatory  appraisal  of  the  beneficiaries  (artisans  and  workers)  of  their  livelihood  especially \nincome from KVI activities, constraints for employment and income-generating opportunities, and capacity and skill \ndevelopment needs; \n\n(ii)  consultation  and  participatory  discussion  with  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  (producers  groups)  on \nmeasures  to  develop  and  extend  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  establish  a  framework  for  capacity \ndevelopment and skills training, and  extend KVI employment opportunities to women and the disadvantaged; \n(iii)  dissemination  and  discussion  with  Government  agencies,  KVI  institutions,  producer  groups,  and  private  sector  to \n\ndevelop specific reform action plan with pro-poor gender focus; and \n\n(iv)  consultation  discussion  with  development  partners  to  receive  feedback  on  relevancy  of  pro-poor  focus  of  the \n\nProgram. \n\n \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nThe C&P plan will be prepared by the attached TA during program implementation. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nKey  Issues. Women play a significant role in khadi production and consumption. Since women comprise a large part of the \nworkforce, the  reforms  will enhance their  employment, upgrade skills, and improve  income prospects. With increasing  work \nopportunities in khadi and increased investment by the private sector, more women may be able to participate in the program \noutputs.  The  khadi  mark  and  wage  stipulations  will  help  reduce  wage  discrimination  of  women  and  promote  equality.  It  will \nhelp  realize  core  labor  standards  in  an  industry  where  a  large  part  of  the  production  is  in  the  informal  sector.  The \nempowerment  of  artisans  through  participation  in  producer  societies  will  give  women  a  voice  in  decisions  relating  to  khadi \nproduction and distribution.  \n \nKey  Actions.

A gender development specialist will be engaged under the TA to support effective realization of the \nProgram\u2019s overall goals. The consultant will ensure capacity development of institutions engaged in the reform process. The \nconsultant, together with an NGO and institutions development specialist, will help KVIC to implement comprehensive reform \nof eligible khadi institutions. Such revitalization would ensure gender supportive processes and technologies (solar-powered \nspindles  for  instance  have  greatly  benefited  women  spinners  and  reduced  drudgery).  The  gender  specialist  will  also  assist \nKVIC  in  enhancing  governance  and  empowering  artisans.  The  gender  development  specialist  will  work  closely  with  other \nconsultants under the technical assistance, i.e., (i) organization and human resource development specialist, (ii) training and \ncapacity  building  specialist,  and  (iii)  NGO  and  institutions  development  specialist,  to  support  gender  sensitivity  and  gender \ndevelopment in a holistic manner. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nNo impact. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \nStrategy to Address \nIssue \nThe Program will address \nmainly institutional, \nmanagerial, and business \nprocess restructuring; no \nresettlement issues are \nexpected. \n \nNo adverse issues related \nto indigenous people are \nanticipated.
