In \norder to ensure the sustainable and effective use of rehabilitated and \nupgraded \n(i) strengthen \nirrigation  systems, \ncommunity  participation  and  ownership \nthrough  participatory \nplanning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  community-managed \nirrigation  schemes  and  other  community  infrastructure;  (ii) enhance \nthe  institutional  capacities  of  community  organizations  and  local \ngovernment  agencies,  and  adopt  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  approach  to  planning  and  monitoring  of  irrigation \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \ndevelopment; \ncommunity-managed \nthe \nirrigation  investments  with  demand-driven  extension  services.  The \nProject  is  expected  to  bring  about  increases  in  irrigated  land  and \ncrop production both in irrigated lowlands and surrounding uplands, \nimproved  household \nfood  security,  crop  diversification,  and \nenhanced  community  livelihood  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will \nbe  implemented  in  11  districts  in  the  provinces  of  Luang  Prabang, \nXayabury,  Xiengkhuang,  and  Huaphanh,  and  the  Xaysomboun \nSpecial Zone. \n \nIn  the  northern  region,  prevailing  subsistence  farming  coupled  with \ndifficult access had slowed the agricultural development. The poverty \nincidence is high at 53% in the northern provinces, where many poor \nfarmers  live  by  subsistence  farming,  seasonal  agricultural  wage \nlabor,  and  shifting  cultivation.  The  use  of  productive  land  in  the \nnorthern region has not been optimized, and substantial potential for \nefficiency  improvement  in  the  use  of  water  resources  has  yet  to  be \nexploited.  Although \nthe  country  as \nnationally  self-sufficient  in  rice  in  2000,  rice  insufficiency  at  the \nhousehold level  persists  in the  northern  region,  where  development \nof irrigation has an important mandate to improve food security and \naffordability of poor households. The Government\u2019s Strategic Vision \nfor the Agricultural Sector recognizes the lack of irrigation facilities as \na fundamental constraint to agricultural development, and its poverty \nreduction strategy aims to assure food security of poor farmers and \nenable them to diversify their cropping systems.  \n\nthe  Government  declared \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nOver  the  past  decade,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsupported  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  core  sector \nstrategy  to  develop  community-managed  schemes  and  promote \nirrigation  management  transfer  through  the  ongoing  Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Project (CMIS). The development impacts \nof  CMIS  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  rehabilitation  of \ncommunity-managed  irrigation  systems  in  improving  food  security \nand  rural  livelihoods  by strengthening  the  self-help  capacity  of  rural \ncommunities in mountainous rural areas. The Project is positioned to \nfurther assist the Government\u2019s efforts in addressing household food \ninsecurity  and  enabling  crop  diversification  by  replicating,  in  the \nnorthern  provinces,  the  successful  community-managed  irrigation \ndevelopment models tested by CMIS.  \n \nTo  further  improve  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  irrigation \nfacilities  over  the  long  run,  the  approach  to  community-managed \nirrigation  development  needs  to  further  strengthen  community \nlocal  government \ninstitutions  and \nthe  assistance  capacity  of \nagencies;  sharpen  participatory  dimensions \nthe  planning, \nin \nconstruction,  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  facilities;  and  integrate \ninvestments  with  other  complementary  agricultural \nirrigation \ndevelopment assistance.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  rural  poverty  in  11  districts  of  the \nnorthern  region  through  sustained  growth  of  agricultural  production \nby  developing  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  with  strong \ncommunity ownership. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  services  and  activities  of  the  following  four \nproject  components  in  an  integrated  manner  to  each  subproject: \n(i) community mobilization, (ii) institutional capacity building for better \nparticipatory  planning \ntechnical  management, \nfacilitation  and \n(iii) rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  community-managed  irrigation \nschemes, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at \n$12.9 million  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost, \n$5.1 million  or  40%  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $7.8  million \nequivalent or 60% is the local currency cost. \n \n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange\n5.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n5.1 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n4.9 \n1.9 \n1.0 \n7.8 \n\nTotal \nCost \n10.0 \n1.9 \n1.0 \n12.9 \n\n% \n\n77 \n15 \n8 \n100 \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nA  loan  of  SDR  6.864 million  ($10 million  equivalent)  will  be  made \nfrom ADB's Asian Development Fund resources and will have a term \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.

Project management units of participating provinces \nwill  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  decision-making,  with  activities  at \nthe  subproject  level  devolved  to  the  extent  possible  to  the  district \nagriculture and forestry service offices and water user associations. \nOverall coordination of the Project will be undertaken by the national \nproject  steering  committee  to  be  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry, and provincial-level coordination \nwill be carried out by provincial-level steering committees chaired by \nthe  vice  governors.  At  the  community  level,  water  user  groups  and \nother farmer groups will be established at each subproject site during \nthe  first  year,  and  at  least  one  man  and  one  woman  from  each \nvillage will be appointed as community-level organizers, who will act \nas  focal  points  for  project  implementation  in  each  community.  More \nthan  12  months  of  lead  time  will  be  spent  discussing  the  project \nconcept  with  participating  communities;  formulating  village  groups \naccording  to  their  interests;  implementing  the  selected  community \nirrigation  rehabilitation;  and \nactivities;  designing  and  planning \nupgrading  water  user  groups \ninto  water  user  associations. \nSubprojects will be selected in phases (10\u201313 subprojects per year) \nin  accordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria,  which  ensure \nthat  the  Project  will  finance  irrigation  scheme  development  that \n(i) significantly  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  through  improving \nfood security, (ii) efficiently increases cropping areas, (iii) is based on \nstrong  community  initiatives  and  ownership,  and  (vi) is  socially  and \nenvironmentally sound. \n \nthan  $500,000 \nGoods  and  related  services  valued  at  more \nequivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding, \nand those valued at $500,000 or less through international shopping \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Off-the-shelf \nitems  including  vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  valued  at  less \nthan $100,000 may be procured through direct purchase. Civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $1 million will be procured by \ninternational competitive bidding, and contracts costing $1 million or \nless will be procured through local competitive bidding.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  57  person-months  of  international  and  230 \nfor  project \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services \n\n\f  v\n\nmanagement and a number of technical inputs. The consultants will \nbe  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants.  \n \nApproximately 30 irrigation schemes serving roughly 1,900 hectares \nof command area will be developed and provided with an integrated \npackage  of  essential  investments  required  to  increase  agricultural \nproduction.  About  37,000  rural  villagers  are  expected  to  benefit \ndirectly from the Project, of whom at least 60% are poor farmers.  \n \nThe  families  with  irrigable  lowland,  about  2,700  of  them,  will  be  the \nmain beneficiaries of irrigation facilities upgraded under the Project. \nThey  are  subsistence  farmers  who  experience  an  average  of  4 \nmonths of rice insufficiency per year, and sometimes practice shifting \ncultivation  in  the  uplands  to  support  their  livelihoods.  Families  who \ndo  not  have  access  to  irrigated  areas,  numbering  about  4,800,  will \nbenefit \nfrom  community  development  activities  and  extension \nservices for upland and rain-fed agriculture.  \n \nThe most important overall impact of the Project will be an increase \nin  food  production  and  the  potential  for  raising  household  incomes. \nBy upgrading small-scale irrigation schemes, the Project is expected \nto (i) ensure  better irrigation  water management,  thereby  increasing \nwet-season  paddy  yields;  (ii) enable  crop  diversification  and  double \ncropping  in  the  dry  season;  (iii) reduce  the  workload  for  the  regular \nrepair  of  diversion  weirs;  (iv) halt  the  cutting  down  of  trees  for  weir \nrepairs;  and  (v) expand  irrigation  command  areas  for  both  the  wet \nand  dry  season  due  to  better  diversion  control  and  improved \ndistribution systems. The economic internal rates of return calculated \nfor potential subprojects range from 12% to 19%. \n \nPotential risks that may undermine the project impacts center around \ninstitution-building  challenges  including  (i) limited  human  resources \nand  budgetary  allocation  made  available  for  relevant  province  and \ndistrict  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices  to  support  project \nactivities  in  the  field,  and  (ii) the  degree  of  maturity  of  community \norganization  development.  With  regard \nimplementation \ncapacity  risk  of  the  Department  of  Irrigation  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  as  well  as  the  project  management  units, \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases  to  ease  the \nadministrative  work  burden  and  to  enable  delivery  of  high-quality \nassistance for implementation of each subproject. \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Northern  Community-Managed \nIrrigation Sector Project (the Project).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nAgriculture in the Northern Region \n\n \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  Mekong  region,  with  an  estimated \n2. \nper capita income of $310. The total population of the country is 5.5 million, of whom about 30% \nlive below the national poverty line.2 While sound progress in reducing poverty is being made, \nthe strategic thrust and priority of the country\u2019s long-term socioeconomic development remains \nthe  reduction  of  the  prevailing  high  poverty  incidence.  To  this  end,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES)  and  aims  to \ngraduate from least-developed country status by 2020. The country strategy and program of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  oriented  to  helping  implement  the  NGPES,  including  the \npreparation  of  the  Northern  Region  Development  Strategy,  which  highlights  the  geographic \nadvantage and growing trading opportunities in the northern region with neighboring countries. \nBordering southern People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, the \nnorthern region has been historically the central hub for regional trade that connects important \nroutes  between  the  PRC  and  Southeast  Asia.  With  the  recent  substantial  development  of  the \nregion\u2019s  road  network,  regional  agricultural  trade  offers  increasingly  tangible  business \nopportunities for some agricultural commodities (para. 23).  \n \nAgriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the  Lao  PDR,  accounting  for  50%  of  gross  domestic \n3. \nproduct  (GDP)  and  employing  80%  of  the  total  labor  force.  While  the  sector  covers  various \neconomic activities ranging from rice farming for subsistence to agro-processing industries, rice \ncultivation is the single most prevalent economic activity in the country, and rice is grown over \nabout 639,000 hectares (ha), or 72% of the total cultivated area. Rice is the staple food source, \nwhich  accounts  for  about  67%  of  daily  calorie  intake  for  much  of  the  rural  population.  The \nagriculture sector\u2019s development has significant implications for poverty reduction efforts in the \ncountry,  as  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  rural  population  are  subsistence  farmers  (75%), \nwho  experience  on  average  4  months  of  rice  insufficiency  a  year.  Over  the  past  decade,  the \ndevelopment  of  irrigation  facilities  has  been  the  driving  force  of  agricultural  growth  in  the \ncountry, and increased irrigated crop production, particularly during the dry season, has helped \nlift national rice production to the level of self-sufficiency. However, significant rice insufficiency \nat the household level persists, particularly in the northern region, due to the low productivity of \nthe land in the region and the low degree of integration among various domestic markets and \ndistribution systems in the country.  \n \nPoverty  incidence  in  the  northern  region  is  high  at  53%.  A  population  of  just  over \n4. \n2 million  live  in  the  northern  region,  and  currently  little  more  than  10%  of  the  population  are \nurbanized. Farmers in the northern region typically face up to 6 months of rice insufficiency in a \nyear. Limited farmland and its low productivity have kept upland communities in a state of food \n\n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 sets out the project framework.  \n2  Based on preliminary results of the 2002/03 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey. The poverty headcount for \n\nthe country has fallen from 38.6% in 1997/98 to about 30% in 2002/03. \n\n\f2 \n\ninsecurity.  Irrigable  flat  lands  are  limited  to  valley  floors  in  the  mountainous  areas  with  the \naverage  irrigated  area  per  household  rarely  exceeding  0.5  ha.  Consequently,  many  farmers \ncultivate lowlands as well as uplands, where shifting cultivation is usually practiced in a situation \nof ever-shorter fallow periods. In most of the lowland areas, single wet-season rice cropping is \nthe  norm,  and  traditional  glutinous  varieties  are  grown.  Under  rain-fed  upland  conditions,  rice \nand corn are commonly grown using shifting cultivation. Various levels of crop diversification are \nseen during the dry season, largely depending on water availability.  \n \nFacing  insufficiency  of  rice,  the  foremost  concern  of  poor  farmers  is  to  improve  their \n 5. \nlevels of rice sufficiency.3 Rural households in the northern provinces typically make up for the \nrice  shortfall  by  collecting  forestry  products  for  consumption  and  income  generation.  Another \nmeans  to  alleviate  the  rice  deficit  is  seasonal  hiring  of  farm  wage  laborers  during  the \ntransplanting  and  harvesting  seasons,  and  the  sale  of  cash  crops.  Attracted  by  higher  wages \noffered  in  neighboring  countries,  laborers  face  incentives  to  cross  the  border  to  work, \nparticularly  during  seasonal  demand  peaks  for  unskilled  labor.  At  present,  once-abundant \nforestry  resources  are  showing  signs  of  dwindling  through  overexploitation,  and  foraging  to \nsupplement food requirements is becoming increasingly difficult. Livestock production provides \na means of saving and a coping mechanism during hardship as a major source of substantial \ncash  earnings.4  With  such  earnings,  rural  households  buy  rice  to  satisfy  some  of  their \nconsumption  needs.  Although  the  volume  is  limited,  surplus  rice  of  both  glutinous  and  non-\nglutinous kinds is traded locally during the harvest season, and local rice millers and traders sell \nrice  varieties  imported  from  southern  PRC,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam,  during  the  wet  season, \nwhen the supply of local rice becomes scarce.5  \n \nWhile  the  northern  region  is  mountainous  and  arable  valley  floors  are  relatively  small, \n6. \nthe use of productive land has not been optimized and the potential for efficiency improvement \nof  water  resources  is  yet  to  be  exploited.  The  northern  region  is  endowed  with  streams  often \nwith small catchment areas, where many traditional weirs have been constructed to divert water \nto  small  adjacent  paddy  fields.  Existing  irrigation  schemes  provide  water  and  water \nmanagement to only approximately 36% of the total cultivated area during the wet season. The \nuse  of  dry-season  irrigation  is  still  rare  due  to  inefficiency  and  limited  scope  for  expansion  of \ntraditional irrigation schemes. Typical yields of rain-fed upland and lowland rice are 1.5 and 2.0 \ntons  (t)/ha,  respectively.  This  compares  with  a  national  average  of  2\u20133  t/ha  for  lowland  wet-\nseason crops, and 3\u20134 t/ha for dry-season irrigated crops,6 which are also relatively low when \ncompared  with  levels  elsewhere  in  Asia.  Both  the  upland  and  lowland  cropping  practices  are \nbased  on  a  system  of  minimum  inputs:  fertilizer  inputs  are  low,  pesticide  use  is  minimal,  and \nmechanization  is  almost  nonexistent.  Traditional  varieties  predominate  in  all  cropping \nenvironments.  \n \n\n2. \n\nIrrigation Subsector \n\n \n7. \nThe  estimated  22,240  irrigation  systems  service  a  total  area  of  about  280,000  ha,  and \nirrigated  agricultural  production  accounts  for  about  65%  of  total  agricultural  production  in  the \ncountry.7 The most numerous irrigation systems are small-scale schemes with traditional weirs, \n                                                 \n3  The single most important need unequivocally identified by farmers of all ethnic groups in the project provinces is \n\nimproved rice production. \n\nyear. \n\n4  For instance, the sale of one head of buffalo or cattle often provides a family of four to five members with rice for a \n\n5  A study of the National Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute and the International Rice Research Institute in \nMarch 2002 reported that the amount of rice traded in the Lao PDR is less than 10% of production because most \nof the rice produced is consumed by producers themselves. \n\n6  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 2003.

They  provide  supplementary  irrigation  water  that \nexpands  the  cropping  area  and  assures  continuous  water  delivery  during  the  wet  season.9 \nWater use efficiency of the traditional schemes is very low, particularly during the dry season, \ndue  to  high  seepage  and  conveyance  loss.  Large  pump  schemes  that  are  suitable  for  high-\nvalue  cash crop  production  are  only  prevalent  in  the lowlands,  where there  are  large  areas  of \nirrigable land with good physical access to markets.  \n \n8. \nPast investments made to rehabilitate community-managed irrigation (CMI) schemes in \nthe  country  have  demonstrated  their  effectiveness  in  improving  food  security  and  rural \nlivelihoods  by  strengthening  the  self-help  capacity  of  rural  communities  in  mountainous  rural \nareas.  The  Community-Managed \nthe \nrehabilitation  of  47  small-scale  CMI  schemes  with  a  command  area  of  3,720  ha,  and  reduced \npoverty among project beneficiaries by generating substantial increases in household incomes \nand  per  capita  paddy  production  in  the  project  area.11  The  incremental  agricultural  activities \nwere derived from an expanded cropping area, enhanced crop yields, and crop diversification.12 \nSuch  a  community-driven  poverty  reduction  approach  is  central  to  the  NGPES,  which \nencourages  investments  to  modernize  agricultural  production  of  poor  farmers  so  as  to  meet \ntheir subsistence needs, and eventually help them to diversify into higher-value crop production. \nHaving recognized the increased efficiency and lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \nachieved by CMI scheme rehabilitation, the Government is promoting CMI scheme development \nand irrigation management transfer as a core sector development strategy (Appendix 2). \n\nIrrigation  Sector  Project  (CMIS)10  has  assisted \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy for Agriculture Development  \n\n \nUnlike  the  diversified  lowland  agriculture  along  the  Mekong  corridor,  prevailing \n9. \nsubsistence  farming,  coupled  with  access  difficulties  and  the  lack  of  a  viable  rural  finance \nsystem,  limited  the  opportunities  to  advance  agriculture  in  the  northern  region  in  the  past. \nConsequently,  the  productivity  of  land  and  water  resources  remains  below  its  potential  today. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Vision  for  the  Agricultural  Sector  recognizes  the  lack  of  irrigation \nfacilities as a fundamental constraint to agricultural development, which needs to be corrected in \norder  to  improve  the  affordability  and  livelihood  of  subsistence  farmers.  The  rehabilitation  of \nirrigation  facilities  in  a  manner  that  fully  observes  sustainable  practices  is  an  effective  and \nproven  way  to  improve  agricultural  production  over  the  medium  term  through  enhancing  the \nproductivity of their resource endowment. Furthermore, with current major aid agency support to \nimprove the road network, rural finance system, and extension system, CMI facility rehabilitation \nwill form a crucial foundation for shifting subsistence agriculture to a commercial farming system \n\n                                                 \n8  The  Department  of  Irrigation  defines  schemes  with  a  service  area  up  to  100 ha  as  small-scale  irrigation  schemes, \nthose  of  100\u2013500 ha  as  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes,  and  those  of  500 ha  and  above  as  large  irrigation \nschemes. \n\n9  Surface  water  is  usually  utilized  for  such  irrigation  system,  and  little  is  known  of  the  potential  for  the  use  of \n\nalternative water sources, such as groundwater and the deep aquifers. \n\n10  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \n\nPDR for the Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project. Manila. \n\n11  Poverty as measured by the number of rice-deficit households has fallen from about 40% in 1998 to close to zero \nin  2002.  Over  this  period,  average  annual  per  capita  paddy  production  increased  from  223 kg  to  570 kg,  and \naverage annual household cash income from KN540,000 to KN3.6 million. \n\n12  The yield improvement originates from greater yield stability generated by supplementary irrigation during periods \nof low rainfall. Irrigated conditions also complement the effectiveness of soil fertility improvement technologies and \nthe use of improved seeds. \n\n\f4 \n\nby expanding the cropping area, improving crop yields, and enabling crop diversification through \ndry-season  irrigation.13  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  principle  of  the  Country  Strategy \nand  Program  (2004\u20132006)  of  ADB,  which  is  promoting  agricultural  diversification  and  income \ngeneration in poor rural areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nSustainability of Community-Managed Irrigation Schemes \n\n \n10. \nNotwithstanding  the  viability  of  CMI  schemes  in  enhancing  agricultural  production,  the \nsustainable  operation  of  CMI  schemes  beyond  the  period  of  funding  agency  investments  has \nbeen  a  major  challenge  for  the  Government,  major  funding  agencies,  and  nongovernment \norganizations in the sector (Appendix 3). In general, small weirs for CMI are designed to meet \nthe  once-in-50-year  flood  criteria  in  the  country.  The  sustainability  of  rehabilitated  irrigation \nschemes depends largely on (i) continuous participation of communities in water management \nand  O&M  of  the  schemes,  (ii) technical  and  management  ability  of  water  user  associations \n(WUAs),  (iii) ability  of  local  government  agencies  to  provide  required  support  to  WUAs, \n(iv) financial affordability by farmers, and (v) watershed protection to minimize siltation of weirs \nand  canals.  While  the  fiscal  budget  allocation  for  O&M  of  irrigation  schemes  is  inadequate  to \ncover  the  requirements  of  all  irrigation  schemes,  much  of  the  physical  and  financial \nrequirements for O&M can be met by community contributions. \n \nCommunity Participation and Ownership. The degree of community participation and \n11. \nownership  is  highly  relevant  to  O&M  performance.  Limited  community  consultation  is  likely  to \nresult in a low level of awareness among WUA members of O&M responsibility. Thus, strategic \ninvestments in developing community institutions and generating incentives for participation and \nownership  among  farmers  from  an  early  stage  are  critical  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nirrigation schemes. To this end, local government\u2019s assistance for villagers is significant. Sector \nexperience  also  indicates  that  participatory  development  of  community  assets  that  will  benefit \nthe entire community, such as access roads and domestic water supply, are good at attracting \nthe active participation of all villagers, enhance further the development impacts of CMI scheme \nrehabilitation, and facilitate the selection of the most suitable scheme design and alignment by \nencouraging village walks and discussions.  \n \nOperation  and  Maintenance.  It  is  imperative  that  participating  communities  become \n12. \nfully aware of their O&M responsibilities and the level of community contribution required, prior \nto their involvement in the Project, so that they can design and select schemes for which they \ncan afford the O&M requirements. For a small-scale irrigation scheme of about 60\u2013100 ha, the \nmaintenance  works  required  to  ensure  its  sustainable  use  are  (i) routine  maintenance  that \ninvolves  desilting  and  weeding  of  weir  and  canals,  which  can  be  managed  by  farmer  labor; \n(ii) periodic  maintenance,14  which  is  expected  every  15  years  and  requires  both  labor  and \nimported  materials;  and  (iii) emergency  maintenance  that  should  be  conducted  by  the \nGovernment  to  repair  the  damage  caused  by  natural  calamities.  Routine  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated  weirs  and  canals  requires  significantly  less  labor  than  that  required  in  the  wet \nseason  for  the  yearly  reconstruction  and  extensive  repairs  of  traditional  weirs.  The  required \npurchase of imported  materials (wire or concrete) will be financed by the irrigation service fee \n(ISF) to be collected over the long term, and farmers will obtain the technical skills required for \n\n                                                 \n13  The  Strategic  Vision  for  the  Agricultural  Sector,  adopted  in  1999,  aims  to  achieve  household  food  security  and \ndiversification  of  farming  systems  in  rural  sloping-land  communities  through  expanding  irrigated  agriculture  by \n2020. The Project will contribute to the achievement of midterm goals in increasing CMI schemes, improving wet-\nseason  rice  yield,  expanding  dry-season  irrigation,  and  enhancing  household  income  through  farming \ndiversification by 2010. \n\n14  Lacing of wire nets in the case of gabion schemes, or fixing cracks and wears of concrete structures in the case of \n\nreinforced concrete weirs. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nperiodic  maintenance  by  participating  in  the  rehabilitation  works  of  weirs  and  canals.  Better \nwater-flow  control,  enabled  by  managing  lift  gates  of  modern  weirs  and  canal  structures,  will \nalso  reduce  the  scope  of  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  significantly  by  avoiding  damage \nfrom flash floods and overtopping of sidewalls and embankments.  \n \n13. \nAt present, WUAs collect a level of ISFs affordable to farmers without giving adequate \nconsideration to the estimated cost of long-term maintenance. WUAs collect and deposit ISFs in \nbank accounts to be utilized for future maintenance expenditures. The current ISF level may risk \nthe  sustainability  of  rehabilitated  irrigation  schemes  since  the  amounts  collected  may  not  be \nenough  for  future  maintenance  works.  Feasibility  studies  of  potential  subprojects  illustrate  the \namount that farmers can afford for ISFs that cover the cash expenditures on both routine and \nperiodic  maintenance\u2014approximately  KN189,000  per  ha,  which  accounts  for  about  10%  of \nexpected  incremental  financial  net  income  per  ha.  Therefore,  ISF  collection  performance \ndepends largely on farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. Hence, it is indispensable that local government \nagencies (i) provide adequate technical assistance for participating communities in selecting the \nleast-cost  option  by  estimating  future  O&M  costs;  and  (ii) during  the  initial  discussions,  clearly \nexplain  to  communities,  and  confirm  their  willingness  to  pay,  the  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance costs for which they will be responsible.  \n \n14. \nCommunity Management Capacity. Upgrading of traditional irrigation schemes without \nchanging the basic designs has proven to be the best way to minimize institutional challenges \nimposed  on  the  use  of  rehabilitated  schemes  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  vast  majority  of  CMI \nrehabilitation investments just replaced traditional weirs with permanent structures at the same \nlocations  and  extended  existing  canals  because  farmers  are  used  to  the  existing  schemes, \neasily  understand  the  benefit  of  upgrading,  and  already  have  management  systems  for  the \ndiversion  and  distribution  of  irrigation  water  over  the  command  areas.  Many  traditional  weirs \nhave been constructed with village initiatives and are well maintained by communities under the \nleadership of village chiefs, despite a high labor requirement for frequent repairs. In contrast, the \nmanagement  of  rehabilitated  schemes  requires  more  careful  O&M  planning,  as  some  cash \nexpenditures for imported materials are required for periodic maintenance works, which need to \nbe  financed  through  the  collection  of  ISFs.  In  order  for  WUAs  to  improve  their  capacity  to \nmanage the planning required, technical assistance of local government agencies is essential, \nparticularly  in  (i) planning  ISF  collection  based  on  estimated  O&M  expenditures,  and \n(ii) managing  the  collected  ISF  funds.  The  establishment  of  a  system  that  allows  farmers  to \nevaluate  the  management  of  village  activities  is  also  indispensable  to  maintain  transparency \nand farmers\u2019 incentives to sustain the irrigation development activities.15  \n \n15. \nCommunity Solidarity Development. It is important to combine livelihood improvement \nactivities  that  are  complementary  to  irrigation development,  ensure  an  equitable  distribution  of \nbenefits  generated  within  each  community,  and  provide  incentives  for  the  whole  village  to \nparticipate in irrigation development initiatives. Irrigation interventions alone tend to exclude the \nmost vulnerable groups within participating villages, as the poorest farmers usually have limited \naccess to irrigable land. Exclusion of the poorest groups has risks of worsening the inequalities \nthat  already  exist  in  communities,  as  well  as  affecting  the  development  of  sustainable \ncommunity organizations necessary for the long-term O&M of irrigation facilities. By combining \nvillage  livelihood  activities,  irrigation  rehabilitation  can  also  assist  in  forming  a  new  leadership \nwithin participating communities that represents wider interests of villagers (Appendix 4). \n \n\n                                                 \n15  WUAs  need  to  develop  democratic  and  effective  management  mechanisms  through  the  establishment  of \nmanagement  committees  with  periodically  elected  members,  bookkeeping,  and  group  discussions  for  major \ndecisions. \n\n\f6 \n\nIntegrated  Water  Resource  Management.  The  Water  Resource  Coordination \n16. \nCommittee  (WRCC)  is  the  national  coordination  body  responsible  for  river  basin  development \nplanning in the country. While water conflict among irrigation schemes is not an issue during the \nwet  season  at  present  due  to  abundant  water  flow  and  a  small  amount  diverted  at  each  weir, \ncareful  consideration  needs  to  be  given  in  selecting  subprojects  for  potential  effects  on \ndownstream water users to avoid water conflicts and to optimize the use of common water. To \nensure  sustainable  use  of  water  resources,  CMI  development  needs  to  be  planned  and \nmonitored by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) in close consultation with WRCC.  \n \n17. \nIntegration  of  Catchment  Rehabilitation  Activities.  Streams  in  mountainous  areas \nare  frequently  experiencing  shorter  and  higher  wet-season  flows,  and  longer  and  lower  dry-\nseason flows. These changes have direct effects on irrigated agriculture in the valley floors of \nmountainous areas. The changes reflect activities within catchments, including poorly regulated \ncommercial  logging  and  nontraditional  shifting  cultivation,  both  of  which  are  leading  to  the \ncatchments' degradation and affecting stream flows. Support for the rehabilitation of catchments \nadjacent  to  irrigation  scheme  areas  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  sustainable  use  of  CMI \nschemes and to complement upland agricultural activities.16  \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \nThe  competency  in  technical  aspects  of  agriculture  and  irrigation,  and  project \n18. \nimplementation capacity of DOI and local government staff, appears to be adequate, and they \nhave  acquired  relevant  field  experience  necessary  for  CMI  development  through  successfully \nimplementing  CMIS  and  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and  Management  Project \n(DIDM).17 DOI is the primary agency responsible for irrigation development in the country, and \nhas  been  facilitating  the  development  of  CMI  schemes  for  over  a  decade.  By  promoting  the \nestablishment  of  a  WUA  in  each  irrigation  scheme  and  technically  supporting  provincial \nirrigation  service  offices  located  in  18  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices \n(PAFSOs),  DOI  has  efficiently  expanded  the  outreach  of  irrigation  services.  However,  the \nfacilitation  of  active  community  participation  and  a  more  integrated  approach  to  agricultural \ndevelopment  assistance  call  for  further  improvement  of  local  government  staff  in  social \nintermediation skills and technical knowledge relevant to extension services. At the same time, \nWUAs and village leaders need to strengthen their coordination system with local government \nagencies in order to take advantage of the most relevant and appropriate technical assistance \nfor  their  villages.  In  recognition  of  the  challenging  task,  the  Government  has  committed  to \n(i) assign  at  least  four  PAFSO  staff  and  two  district  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office \n(DAFSO)  staff  to  the  Project  in  each  participating  province  and  district  to  the  Project; \n(ii) establish coordination linkages with district Lao Women\u2019s Unions (DLWUs) and community-\nlevel  organizers  (CLOs)  in  villages;  and  (iii) allocate  a  substantial  budget  for  recurrent \nexpenditures, which is essential to support critical field works.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSector Policy and Regulatory Issues  \n\n \n19. \nDuring the past decade, ADB has assisted the Government in supporting the creation of \nan enabling regulatory environment, in institutional strengthening, and in project investments for \nCMI  development.  CMIS  has  been  instrumental  in  creating  an  adequate  regulatory  setting  for \n\n                                                 \n16  The  CMIS  pilot  tested  catchment  rehabilitation  activities  such  as  forage,  tree  plantation,  and  other  cropping  on \n\nmoderately sloping lands surrounding the irrigation schemes. \n\n17  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \nPDR  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and  Management  Project.  Manila.  The  CMIS  staff  gained \nsubstantial  experience  in  selecting  a  suitable  scheme  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria,  conducting \nfeasibility and impact studies, establishing WUAs, and making construction and O&M arrangements with farmers. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nWUA  establishment  and  improving  household  food  security  in  the  central  and  northern \nprovinces,  while  the  DIDM  has  assisted  in  implementing  the  irrigation  management  transfer \npolicy  and  promoting  the  commercialization  of  agriculture  in  the  lowlands.  Subsequently,  the \nNam  Ngum  River  Basin  Development  Sector  Project18  introduced  river  basin-based  integrated \nwater  resource  management  to  the  irrigation  subsector.  The  Project  is  positioned  to  further \nassist  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in  addressing  household  food  insecurity  and  enabling  crop \ndiversification by replicating, in the northern provinces, the successful CMI development models \ntested by CMIS.  \n \n20. \nTo  further  strengthen  sustainability  and  effectiveness  of  the  development  of  CMI \nschemes  under  the  Project,  empowerment  of  community  organizations  and  development  of \ninstitutional capacity at local government agencies are essential. Accordingly, the Government \nhas  improved  the  relevant  policy  and  regulatory  environment  in  three  major  areas.  First,  it \nissued  a  ministerial  guideline  to  the  irrigation  management  transfer  policy  No. 0672  in  August \n2003 in order to (i) focus the payment responsibility of WUAs with small-scale schemes on the \nISFs  that  will  fully  cover  future  O&M  costs,  not  on  the  repayment  of  the  rehabilitation  capital \ncosts; (ii) allow each WUA to decide its ISF level based on its future maintenance requirement; \nand  (iii) clarify  that  the  WUA\u2019s  responsibility  covers  only  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \nworks.19  With  the  guideline  in  place,  local  government  staff  and  farmers  can  now  delineate  a \nclear division of maintenance responsibilities prior to the construction of irrigation schemes and \nstipulate  these  responsibilities  in  the  WUA  registration  documents  accordingly.  Second,  as  an \nessential step of agricultural resource use planning, the Government agreed to (i) exercise the \nequitable  and  participatory  village  consultation  process  in  allocating  land  use  rights20  and \n(ii) accord  the  grace  period  for  land  tax  collection  in  accordance  with  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decree \nNo. 150.  Land  use  planning  and  allocation  are  fundamental  requirements  both  to  ensure \nproductive  use  of  uplands  by  generating  incentives  for  farmers  to  invest  their  efforts,  and  to \nwiden  project  benefits  to  cover  entire  project  communities.  Third,  as  a  measure  to  implement \nthe  Water  Law  and  relevant  decrees,  DOI  will  establish  an  institutional  linkage  with  WRCC \nthrough  water  requirement  surveys,  consultation  for  future  irrigation  development  planning, \nhydrologic  data  sharing,  and  eventually  application  for  water  use  rights  for  each  subproject.21 \nThis  linkage  will  enable  the  introduction  of  integrated  water  resource  management  approach \ninto the project implementation, and avoid potential conflicts over water allocation that may arise \nin the future (Appendix 2).  \n \n\n5. \n\nIntegration of Extension Assistance \n\n \n21.  While improving water availability through upgraded irrigation facilities is an effective tool \nin  itself  for  increasing  agricultural  production,  further  agricultural  production  gains  can  be \nachieved  when  a  well-designed  agricultural  extension  program  complements \nirrigation \nimprovement.  Various  research  and  extension  development  initiatives  exist  in  the  country  to \ndevelop  proven  production-enhancing  technologies  and  measures  to  minimize  preharvest  and \npostharvest losses for both irrigated areas and uplands in the northern region.22 By collaborating \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \n\nPDR for the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project. Manila. \n\n19  The Government will provide assistance for repairs made necessary as a result of floods or other natural disasters \n\n20  As stipulated in MAF instruction No. 0822 issued in August 1996. \n21  The Water Law was adopted in October 1996 and Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 204 was issued in October 2001 to \n\n(force majeure).   \n\nguide law enforcement. \n\n22  Relevant  ongoing  assistance  in  the  country  includes  the  development  of  improved  varieties,  soil  fertility \nmanagement,  rodent  management,  and  upland  agriculture  development  managed  by  the  Lao  International  Rice \nResearch Institute, the Integrated Upland agriculture Research Project, and Centre de cooperation internationale \nen recherche agronomique pour le developpement.  \n\n\f8 \n\nwith  such  existing  research  and  extension  development  initiatives,  irrigation  rehabilitation  will \nmore  effectively  support  (i) substantial  yield  improvements  of  both  lowland  and  upland  crops \nand  (ii) introduction  of  double  cropping  in  lowlands  during  the  dry  season  in  northern \nprovinces.23  Due  to  considerably  diverse  farming  conditions  in  the  northern  region,  no  single \nmodel  for  agricultural  extension  services  can  meet  the  requirements  of  all  farmers.  Hence, \nextension  assistance  packages  need  to  be  tailored  to  suit  local  conditions,  and  need  to  be \nintroduced with active interaction between CLOs and DAFSO/PAFSO staff to reflect the priority \nneeds and capacity of poor beneficiaries.  \n \n\n6. \n\nMarketing Opportunities \n\n  \n22. \nIn  general,  farmers  are  generally  well  informed  on  the  marketability  and  prices  of \nagricultural products, and capable of making their own decisions on what is best to grow based \non the information they have. Farmers in the project area obtain marketing information, such as \nprices and marketability of cash crops, and price differences between the farmgate prices and \nthe district or provincial market prices, through interactions with traders and occasional visits to \nmarkets.  They  have  physical  access  to  markets  at  least  during  the  dry  season  when  cash \ncropping  and  trading  are  carried  out.24  Trading  opportunities  for  surplus  produce  are  often \nprovided by the village visits of local traders and periodic roadside markets. Villagers also walk \nor occasionally take local buses to go to market to sell their produce, especially when they have \na  larger  volume  of  produce  to  sell,  but  prefer  to  trade  with  buyers  in  their  villages  because \ntransport costs tend to cancel out any additional gains they may obtain from their sales at the \nmarket. \n \nincreased  water  availability,  associated  extension  services,  and  access \n23.  With \nimprovement  to  the  nearest  road  links,  farmers  are  expected  to  respond  to  the  existing \nopportunities  reasonably  well.  Some  districts  have  a  considerable  market  potential  for \ndiversification implied by the presence of a substantial size of existing regional trade of maize \nand other grain crops. Though far away from the country\u2019s capital, some subprojects are close \nto  international  borders,  where  significant  informal  exports  of  cash  crops  are  prevalent.  The \nNorthern  Region  Development  Strategy25  reports  that  the  major  export  destinations  for  grain \ncrops, vegetables, and nontimber forestry products produced in the project area are Thailand, \nViet  Nam,  and  southern  PRC.  The  recent  road  network  improvement  in  the  northern  region \nseems to have improved such marketing opportunities further.26  \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n24. \nThe  implementation  experience  of  CMIS  and  other  aid  agency-funded  projects  in  the \ncountry  underscored  the  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  CMI  development  in  reducing  poverty \nand  improving  food  security  through  strengthening  the  self-help  capacity  of  poor  farmers \n(Supplementary  Appendix G).  A  special  evaluation  study  of  CMIS  concluded  that  participatory \nirrigation scheme development is feasible and can contribute strongly to poverty reduction and \nfood security through increasing agricultural production and household income.27 The strengths \n                                                 \n23  An agricultural evaluation suggests a potential of over 50% yield gain for lowland rice and upland corn during the \nwet season, and double cropping of vegetables and corn during the dry season within 5 years in the project area. \nSee Supplementary Appendix I for details. \n\n24  Many  of  the  potential  subprojects  have  unsealed  road  access  to  district  markets,  and  in  some  cases  provincial \nmarkets. In more remote locations, river access by  boat is  possible, by  which farmers go to market to purchase \ngoods for agricultural and household use. \n\n25  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nof project design of CMIS are found in its participatory approach and in its focus on interventions \naddressing  the  most  important  production  constraints  of  poor  farmers,  namely  expansion  of \npaddy  land  and  enhancement  of  land  productivity.28  The  importance  of  the  participatory \ndimension to all management functions has also been widely shared by international experience \nin  promoting  participatory  irrigation  management.29  Building  community  ownership  through \nfacilitation of beneficiary participation from the early stages of project design appears to be the \nkey to ensuring effective and sustainable use of irrigation facilities. \n \nA relevant lesson learned from CMIS is that a participatory approach requires substantial \n25. \nlead-in time to allow meaningful field discussions to take place and to nurture community group \ndevelopment,  and  the  Project\u2019s  implementation  schedule  needs  to  be  adjusted  accordingly. \nOther major lessons learned from CMIS suggest that greater attention should be paid to (i) an \nintegrated  approach  by  combining  irrigation  services  with  agricultural  and  rural  development \nactivities  directed  to  the  needs  of  local  farmers  both  to  effectively  achieve  the  objective  of \nincreased  production  and  to  widen  participation  and  benefit  sharing  throughout  participating \ncommunities;  (ii) efforts  of  local  government  agencies  to  systematically  facilitate  beneficiary \nconsultations;  and  (iii) technical  and  managerial  support  for  communities,  integrated  water \nresource management, and catchment area rehabilitation to ensure sustainable use of irrigation \nschemes. To fortify sustainability, institution-building support should be extended more to district \ngovernment staff as well as to village leaders and representatives. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\nA. \n \nThe  project  goal  is  to  reduce  rural  poverty  in  11  districts  in  the  northern  provinces \n26. \nthrough  sustained  agricultural  growth.  The  immediate  objective  is  to  increase  agricultural \nproduction  and  income-earning  opportunities  in  the  project  area  through  the  development  of \nCMI schemes with strong community ownership. To meet the daunting challenge of agricultural \ndevelopment in the northern region, a phased approach over the long term must be employed. \nAs a first step, the rehabilitation of irrigation facilities will help satisfy the subsistence needs of \nthe rural poor population, and prepare them for crop diversification by strengthening their self-\nhelp capacity. \n \n27. \nThe project area will involve 11 districts in the provinces of Luang Prabang, Xayabury, \nXiengKhuang,  and  Huaphanh,  and  the  Xaysomboun  Special  Zone.30  The  project  target  areas \nhave  been  selected,  based  on  considerations  of  food  insecurity,  technical  feasibility, \nimplementation  capacity  of  local  government  agencies,  and  the  Government\u2019s  development \npriorities. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  the  following  components:  (i) community  mobilization, \n(ii) institutional  capacity  building  for  better  participatory  planning  facilitation  and  technical \nmanagement, (iii) CMI investment, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n                                                 \n28  The  evaluation  reports  of  other  funding  agencies\u2019  rural  development  projects  in  the  country  emphasize  that \nmeeting food sufficiency needs is a precondition for introducing any alternative economic activities in rural areas. \n\n29  World Bank Institute. 2000. Case Studies in Participatory Irrigation Management. Washington, DC. \n30  The project districts are Luang Prabang, Nam Bak, Ngoi of Luang Prabang province, Paklai and Thong Mixay of \nXayabury province, Sobbao and Viengxai of Houaphan province, Khoun and Kham of Xiengkhuang province, and \nPhoun  and  Xaisomboun  of  Xaisomboun  Special  Zone.  Of  the  11  districts,  three  are  categorized  as  the  poorest \ndistricts in the country, while another three are categorized as poor districts according to the NGPES. \n\n\f10 \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Mobilization Component \n\n \n29. \nThe  community  mobilization  component  will  formulate  the  social  bases  for  identifying, \nplanning, and implementing sustainable irrigation schemes; various community activities will be \nintroduced  as  a  first  step.  This  process  will  provide  farmers  with  incentives  for  active \nparticipation  in  the  Project  by  immediately  benefiting  all  in  the  participating  communities,  and \npromote farmers with common interests to commence collective community activities in groups. \nDuring the initial stage, options for community activities, such as agricultural extension services \nfor irrigated land and uplands, rural access road upgrading, and rural water supply schemes, will \nbe  presented  to  participating  villages  to  allow  them  to  select  and  plan  implementation  and \nmaintenance arrangements. This process will allow time to interact with the communities to gain \na better understanding of potential irrigation facility rehabilitation and other project activities. The \ncomponent  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  community  participation  development  plan. \nFarmer  production  groups  and  water  user  groups  (WUGs)  are  expected  to  emerge  as  the \nparticipating villages implement community-related initiatives.  \n \n30.  Where there are needs for improved rural water supply facilities, the Project will support \nthe development of hillside springs and reticulate water to selected points within the villages, as \nwell  as  the  construction  of  sanitary  wells,  which  would  be  lined  with  concrete  rings  and  fitted \nwith simple suction hand pumps. As the social organization required for planning and managing \ndomestic  water  supply  schemes  is  similar  to  that  required  for  WUAs,  the  Project  will  assist  in \nestablishing WUGs to manage both irrigation and domestic water to enable a holistic approach \nto  water  resource  management,  where  feasible.  The  construction  of  deep  wells  with  high-lift \npumps  will  not  be  considered  due  to  (i) high  cost,  (ii) difficulty  in  reaching  remote  sites  with \nconstruction  equipment,  (iii) lack  of  hydrogeological  information,  and  (iv) lack  of  arrangements \nfor the maintenance of wells and pumps.  \n \n31. \nThe Project expects to finance the upgrading of a total of about 30 km of village access \nroads  to  link  irrigation  schemes  and  project  communities  with  the  closest  road  networks.  The \nbetter road access is a critical factor to lead the irrigation development and extension activities \nto enhanced agricultural production. Road design standards will be in accordance with the new \nClass  VIII  standards  for  roads,  with  average  daily  traffic  of  less  than  20.31  Based  on  the \nInternational  Labour  Organization\u2019s  guidelines  for  labor-based  road  construction,  simplified \ntechnical  specifications  and  bidding  documents  will  be  used  to  avoid  complexity  and  reduce \nconstruction costs. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Capacity-Building Component \n\n \n32. \nInstitutional capacity-building support will be focused on the village and district levels to \nsupport  participatory  irrigation  and  community  activity  development.  Assistance  for  local \ngovernment  agencies  has  been  proposed  based  on  a  careful  assessment  of  institutional \ncapacity-building  needs,  and  in  consideration  of  CMIS  implementation  experience  and  other \nagencies\u2019  support.  The  training  program  required  for  DAFSO  and  PAFSO  staff  covers  three \nmajor areas: (i) facilitation of participatory planning with farmers and development of community \norganizations,  and  support  for  establishment  and  strengthening  of  WUG/WUAs;  (ii) technical \ntraining  for  CMI  scheme  construction  and  management,  O&M  planning,  the  latest  agricultural \nextension technologies, and resource use planning activities; and (iii) accounting, environmental \nimpact  evaluation,  resettlement  monitoring,  and \nfacilitation  of  gender-sensitive  village \ndiscussions. At the community level, training and assistance will be required on WUG formation \n\n                                                 \n31  Class VIII roads have a carriage width of 2.0\u20132.5 meters, a formation width of 2.5\u20134.0 meters, and a right of way \n\nfrom the center line of the carriageway of 2.0\u20135.0 meters. \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nand  upgrading  of  WUAs;  planning  and  implementation  of  agricultural  extension  activities;  and \ntraining  required  for  upgrading  rural  access  roads,  recording  and  monitoring  group  activities, \nplanning and implementing O&M, and WUA management of ISF collection and utilization. Local \nstudy  trips  and  experience-sharing  workshops  to  cross-feed  best  practices  will  also  be \nsupported to strengthen the working relationships among PAFSOs, DAFSOs, and villages. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity-Managed Irrigation Investment Component \n\n \nThe  Project  expects  to  rehabilitate  about  30  irrigation  schemes,  and  the  scope  of  civil \n33. \nworks includes (i) replacement of traditional weirs by permanent structures (reinforced concrete \nand  stone  masonry),  (ii) improvement  of  canal  systems  with  reinforced  concrete  canal \nstructures,  (iii) repairs  of  problematic  canal  sections  such  as  leaks  and  cross-drainage,  and \n(iv) construction  of  new  canals  where  expansion  of  the  command  area  is  possible.  Irrigation \ndesign  will  follow  DOI  standards,  and  locally  available  standard  designs  for  weirs  and  canal \nstructures will be used, as they are appropriate for labor-based construction.32 Long lengths of \nconveyance canal will be avoided where possible.  \n \n34. \nActive participation of the beneficiaries will be sought during the survey and design stage \nof each CMI scheme. Beneficiary involvement is particularly important in surveying and planning \n(i) the location and height of weirs, (ii) the replacement of two or more traditional weirs by one \npermanent  weir,  (iii) canal  alignment,  (iv) the  location  and  size  of  canal  structures,  and  (v) the \noverall  scheme  layout.  By  providing  inputs  during  the  survey  and  design  work,  project \nbeneficiaries  are  expected  to  increase  their  sense  of  ownership.  Further,  their  extensive \nknowledge  of  the  project  area  will  improve  the  quality  of  design  works,  minimize  potential \nresettlement  impacts,  and  ensure  that  the  proposed  CMI  scheme  is  in  line  with  farmers\u2019 \nexpectations.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAgricultural Extension and Resource Use Planning Component \n\n \n35.  With  other  ongoing  extension  development  initiatives  in  the  country  (para.  21),  the \nextension  assistance  will  cover  both  irrigated  lowland  rice  production  and  upland  cropping. \nProduction technologies for cash crops will be included where feasible. Participating villages will \nbe exposed to demonstrations and new production technologies applicable to local conditions in \nthe  project  villages.  Field  demonstrations  will  be  carried  out  based  on  a  participatory  needs \nassessment in each participating village to ensure that the service addresses the priority needs \nof  poor  farmers,  in  conjunction  with  the  community  mobilization  component.  Potential \nagricultural  extension  service  packages  will  include  improved  rice-production  technologies, \nlivestock  production  and  management,  crop  diversification,  sloping-land  production \ntechnologies, integrated pest management and weed control, nursery establishment for fruit and \ntimber  trees,  storage  and  postharvest  management  technologies,  and  an  introduction  to \npotential  high-value  cash  crops  where  markets  exist.  The  upland  extension  technology \npackages will be selected based on the communities\u2019 needs and the nature and potential of the \nuplands  peripheral  to  the  irrigable  land.  Catchment  rehabilitation  for  schemes  adjacent  to \nirrigation areas will be included in the upland extension packages as appropriate. \n \n36. \nIn order to increase the efficiency of land use and to facilitate necessary catchment area \nrehabilitation  and  management,  where  applicable  in  the  project  area,  community-based  land \nuse  planning  will  be  introduced.  Based  on  better  control  of  water  resources  with  improved \n\n                                                 \n32  Water demand will be calculated at 4 liters/second/ha of irrigated land. This is high by international standards but is \nnecessary, based on local experience, and is in line with relevant country experience, according to diversion rates \nrecommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\f12 \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nirrigation  facilities,  each  participating  community  will  eventually  develop  an  annual  agricultural \ndevelopment plan to reflect planned cropping patterns, water management, and land allocation. \nThese  plans  will  be  developed  with  the  assistance  of  DAFSO  and  project  staff,  to  ensure  the \noptimal  use  of  resources.  Finalized  agricultural  development  plans  will  be  submitted  to  the \ndistrict authorities for endorsement so that allocation of the land use and water rights indicated \nin the plans will be officially recognized.  \n \nC. \n \n37. \nEnvironmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environment category B. The initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  concluded  that  no  serious  adverse  environmental  impact  is \nexpected  because  of  (i) the  small  size  of  each  irrigation  scheme,  ranging  from  50  to  100  ha; \n(ii) the  exclusion  of  existing  and  proposed  protected  areas  or  other  designated  forestry  or \nwildlife  reserve  or  sanctuary  from  the  project  area;  (iii) subproject  screening  and  preparing  an \nIEE;  and  (iv) regular  monitoring  by  PAFSOs/DAFSOs  and  relevant  provincial  offices  of  the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA).  Subprojects  will  be  screened  for \ncategorization, and IEEs will be prepared for category B subprojects.  \n \n38. \nTo  ensure  adherence  with  all  applicable  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws, \nregulations and standards, and ADB environmental requirements, during subproject preparation \nand  implementation,  an  environmental  management  plan  for  the  Project  has  been  prepared, \nand  will  be  implemented  by  the  office  of  national  project  director  (ONPD)  in  collaboration  with \nthe  PAFSOs/DAFSOs.33  Environmental  measures,  which  need \nimplemented  by \ncontractors,  will  be  incorporated  in  civil  works  contracts.  IEEs  for  subprojects  will be  reviewed \nand  approved  by  the  STEA.  The  results  of  monitoring  will  be  reported  to  DOI/  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF),  STEA,  and  ADB  by  semiannual  project  progress  reports, \ntogether  with  annual  reports  on  environmental  monitoring.  In  addition,  IEEs  for  three  sample \nsubprojects  were  prepared  to  illustrate  the  environmental  management  plan  requirements.  A \nrepresentative summary initial environmental examination of a sample subproject is provided in \nAppendix 5, and the environmental management plan is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n39. \nResettlement. Feasibility studies on four sample subprojects indicate that resettlement, \nif any, will be small and limited to minor land acquisitions for rural access road improvement and \ncanal  expansion.  The  participatory  designing  process  involving  beneficiary  villagers  in  civil \nworks  alignments,  together  with  a  requirement  of  minimum  resettlement  impact  included  in \nsubproject selection criteria, will minimize any potential resettlement impact. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, a resettlement framework and a sample resettlement \nplan  have  been  prepared.34  At  the  time  of  a  feasibility  study,  each  subproject  scheme  will \nprepare  a  resettlement  plan  and  discuss  compensation  entitlements  and  resettlement \nimplementation  arrangements  with  the  affected  people,  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework.  Each  resettlement  plan  is  subject  to  approval  of  ADB,  and  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan  and  framework  will  be  periodically  monitored  by  project  management  units \n(PMUs) at the provincial level, and during ADB review missions.  \n \nClearance  of  Unexploded  Ordnance.  Although  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO)  is  not \n40. \nexpected  to  be  a  major  problem  for  the  Project  in  general,  the  Government  will  clear  the \nsubproject sites prior to undertaking any excavation works, particularly those areas designated \nfor  the  development  of  new  command  areas,  and  areas  to  be  used  for  new  canal  and  road \n                                                 \n33  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  indicated  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n\nto  be \n\n(2003) is included in the environmental management plan. \n\n34  See  Appendix 6  for  Summary  Resettlement  Framework  and  Supplementary  Appendix D  for  Resettlement \n\nFramework and Sample Resettlement Plan. \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nalignments.  The  UXO  LAO  is  responsible  for  UXO  clearance  activities  in  the  country.  It  has \nmore  than  1,100  staff,  involves  four  nongovernment  organizations  and  a  Belgian  company  as \nimplementing partners in the UXO LAO provincial programs, and provides technical and training \nassistance. The budget for UXO LAO is autonomous and is overseen jointly by the Government \nin collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF).  Relevant  district  governments  and  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for \nsubmitting requests for land clearance to the UXO LAO. \n \nEthnic  Minority  Groups.  Of  the  three  major  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area,  the \n41. \nKhmou  and  the  Hmoung  are  the  most  vulnerable,  since  most  of  them  do  not  speak  the \nlanguage of the Lowland Lao, the dominant ethnic group, and they tend to be excluded from the \nmainstream social information network. The Khmou is the poorest ethnic group with an average \nlevel of rice sufficiency of 5.9 months per annum, compared with 8.1 months for the Hmong and \n9 months for the Lowland Lao. As all of the ethnic minority groups are more heavily involved in \nupland  agriculture  than  the  Lowland  Lao,  it  will  be  mainly  this  ethnic  group  that  benefits  from \nirrigation development activities.  \n \n42. \nTo maximize the opportunities for ethnic minority groups to participate in the Project and \nbalance  the  distribution  of  potential  project  benefits,  the  Guideline  for  Ethnic  Minorities \nParticipation  Framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples.35  The  Project  includes  measures  to  improve  the  social  integration  and  livelihood  of \nethnic  minorities,  such  as  the  active  involvement  of  CLOs  selected  from  respective  ethnic \ngroups to address communication difficulties. Representation of all ethnic groups in key project \nactivities will be facilitated at the local community level through the CLOs who are familiar with \nthe  background  of  each  ethnic  group.  The  development  of  project  extension  activities  will  be \ninitiated  through  discussions  with  farmers  to  identify  their  priority  needs,  and  selected  after \nconsideration of the specific needs of each ethnic group. Given the critical food security status \nof  most  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  careful  consideration  will  be  given  to  the \nconsequences of recommending technology options, which do not bring an immediate return on \ninvestment or fail to satisfy household priority consumption needs. \n \n43. \nGender Issues. While women traditionally play a major role in irrigation-related activities \nand all parts of the rice-cropping cycle, women in the project area are disadvantaged relative to \nmen in having a lower level of literacy, and lack opportunities and time to participate on an equal \nbasis as men in meetings, training initiatives, and study tours. In addition, few women farmers \nare  appointed  to  decision-making  positions  in  WUA  committees,  and  only  a  few  women  are \nappointed as technical assistants in local government agencies. The number of female-headed \nhouseholds in the project area is limited, and they are not necessarily categorized as vulnerable \ngroups\u2014except  young  widows  with  small  children,  and  divorcees.  A  gender  plan  has  been \ndeveloped  to  ensure  at  least  50%  representation  of  women  in  project  activities,  with  special \nconsideration  for  poor  women  and  women  of  ethnic  minority  groups  (Supplementary \nAppendix B).  Supported  by  DLWUs  and  CLOs,  the  Project  will  encourage  a  greater  role  for \nwomen  in  the  decision-making  process  of  WUAs  through  prioritizing  women\u2019s  needs,  and \npromoting the role of women in working together with men in the project activities. The Project \nwill collect and monitor gender-disaggregated indicators. \n \n\n                                                 \n35  Supplementary  Appendix A.  The  Guideline  for  Ethnic  Minorities  Participation  Framework  was  endorsed  by  the \n\nGovernment on 16 December 2003. \n\n\f14 \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nD. \n \n44. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  over  6  years  is  estimated  at  $12.9 million  equivalent, \ninclusive  of  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.  Of  the  total  cost,  $5.1 million \nequivalent or 40% will be incurred in foreign exchange, and $7.8 million equivalent or 60% will \nbe incurred in local currency.

The Executing Agency is DOI within MAF, with the PAFSOs in five provinces being \nPMUs. The ONPD located within DOI will have full authority to execute the Project and to liaise \nwith  ADB.  The  ONPD  will  comprise  the  national  project  director,  who  is  a  senior  DOI  staff \nmember, \nirrigation  engineers,  extension  specialists,  community  development  officers, \naccountants,  and  administrative  staff.  PMUs  of  participating  provinces  will  be  responsible  for \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nday-to-day  decision  making,  with  activities  at  the  subproject  level  devolved,  to  the  extent \npossible,  to  the  DAFSOs  and  WUAs.  Each  of  the  five  PMUs  will  be  managed  by  a  project \nmanager, who is a full-time staff member of the PAFSO of the respective province, and have at \nleast  a  full-time  irrigation  engineer,  a  full-time  agricultural  extension  specialist,  a  full-time \nqualified  accountant,  and  a  full-time  social  and  environmental  impact-monitoring  specialist. \nOverall coordination of the Project will be undertaken by the national project steering committee \n(PSC)  to  be  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  MAF;  the  PSC  will  meet  as  required  but  at  least \nevery 6 months.36 In addition, provincial-level steering committees chaired by the vice governor \nwill be established in each of the participating provinces and these committees will meet every 6 \nmonths.37  At  the  community  level,  WUGs  and  other  farmer  groups  will  be  established  at  each \nsubproject site during the first year, and at least one man and one woman from each village will \nbe appointed as CLOs, to act as focal points for the implementation of all project activities at the \ncommunity  level.38  The  lead  time  required  to  discuss  the  project  concept  with  participating \ncommunities,  formulate  village  groups  according  to  their  interests,  implement  the  selected \ncommunity activities, establish WUAs, and plan irrigation rehabilitation will be about 12 months. \nThe  implementation  schedule  is  in  Appendix 8,  and  the  project  implementation  organization \nchart is in Appendix 9. \n \n47. \nThe scheduled period of irrigation development for each subproject is 4 years, with each \nsegment  of  the  process  overlapping  during  the  project  implementation  period.  The Project  will \nbe  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years,  during  which  three  sets  of  subprojects  will  be \ndeveloped.  This  staggered  construction  schedule  will  allow  more  efficient  use  of  survey  and \ndesign  staff,  as  well  as  supervisory  staff  in  the  Government.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  in \nphases  (10\u201313  subprojects  per  year)  in  accordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  The \ncriteria  have  been  developed  to  ensure  that  the  project  finance  irrigation  schemes  (i) will \nsignificantly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  improving  food  security,  (ii) will  efficiently \ndevelop  cropping  areas,  (iii) will  be based  on  strong  community  initiatives  and  ownership,  and \n(iv) will be socially and environmentally sound (Appendix 2).  \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n48. \nGoods  and  related  services  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those  valued  at  $500,000  or  less  through \ninternational  shopping  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Off-the-shelf \nitems  including  vehicles,  equipment,  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be \nprocured through direct purchase. Civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $1 million \nwill  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding,  and  contracts  costing  $1 million  or  less \nthrough  local  competitive  bidding.  An  indicative  list  of  procurements  is  in  Appendix 10.  To \nexpedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance \naction  to  cover  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  including  vehicles  and  equipment.  The \nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  procurement  action  does  not  in  any \nway commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the Project itself. \n \n\n                                                 \n36  The PSC will consist of (i) the director, Department of Planning; (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry permanent \nsecretary;  (iii) the  vice  governor  of  each  participating  province;  (iv) the  director,  DOI;  (v) the  head  of  NAFES;  (vi)  \nrepresentatives  of  the  Department  of  International  Economic  Cooperation,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affaires;  (vii) a \nrepresentative  of  the  Department  of  Financial  Policy,  Ministry  of  Finance;  and  (viii) a  representative  of  the  Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union. \n\n37  Provincial-level steering committee members will include  the head of PAFSO, representatives of the Governor\u2019s \noffice,  the  provincial  health  and  finance  offices,  and  the  district  office  of  communication,  transport,  post,  and \nconstruction (CTPC). \n\n38  In  some  communities  where  different  ethnic  groups  reside,  representatives  of  each  ethnic  group  will  also  be \n\ndesignated as CLOs. \n\n\f16 \n\n 49.  Civil  works  envisaged  under  the  Project  will  consist  of  (i) rehabilitation  or  upgrading  of \nirrigation systems, (ii) construction of village access roads, and (iii) renovation of provincial and \ndistrict extension offices. The majority of the civil works for the irrigation systems will be carried \nout  by  the  WUAs  using  their  own  labor  and  local  materials.  Necessary  equipment  and \nconstruction materials such as cement and steel bars will be procured by the Project. Where the \nconstruction techniques required are beyond the capacity of WUAs, the Project, in consultation \nwith  the  concerned  WUA,  will  award  such  works  through  competitive  bidding  to  prequalified \ncontractors using the Government\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB. Materials such as \nculverts  for  village  access  roads  will  be  procured  by  the  district  office  of  communication, \ntransport, post, and construction (CTPC). In instances where construction requirements cannot \nbe met by the villages, district CTPCs will award such works through local competitive bidding to \nprequalified local contractors using the Government\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to ADB. \nCivil works for renovation of provincial and district extension offices will be awarded by PAFSOs \nand  DAFSOs  using  the  same  procedure.  Civil  works  to  be  contracted  under  the  Project  are \nsmall, and unlikely to be of interest to international bidders. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n50. \nIn  order  to  carry  out  project  activities  successfully,  consulting  services  for  technical \nadvisory  and  project  management  are  required.  A  total  of  57  person-months  for  international \nand  230  person-months  for  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international \nconsulting firm in association with domestic firms, and selected by ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \nselection  method.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consultant  assignments  are  in  Appendix 11.  The \nconsultants will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nThe Government\u2019s attention is called to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on \nfraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n  \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n51. \nUnder the new rules and regulations established to expedite disbursements, the Ministry \nof Finance will establish an imprest account on behalf of the Project with the Bank of the Lao \nPDR,  and  the  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  second-generation  imprest  account  with \nrecognized  commercial  banks  acceptable  to  ADB  to  be  managed  by  ONPD  immediately  after \nloan  effectiveness.  At  the  same  time,  five  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished with recognized commercial banks acceptable to ADB, and operated by each of the \nprovincial-level  project  managers.  The  opening  of  subproject  accounts  is  subject  to  the \nappointment of qualified accountants and the establishment of accounting systems and internal \ncontrol of ONPD that is acceptable to ADB. The project manager within each PAFSO operates a \nsubproject account with a ceiling of $30,000. This ceiling will be increased to $50,000 at project \ncommencement, then to $100,000 at the end of year 1. Each project account will be managed in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  The  initial  combined \ntotal amount in all six accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and no more \nthan  10%  of  the  total  loan.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  imprest  accounts  for  payments  below  the  ceiling  of \n$100,000. In addition to the annual audit requirement, the national project director will conduct \ninspections  of  the  provincial-level  subproject  accounts  from  time  to  time  to  ensure  that \naccounting practices at the province level follow the generally acceptable accounting principles \nwith adequate transparency and good governance. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n52. \nPMUs will submit quarterly reports to ONPD with an update of the physical and financial \nprogress of project implementation against agreed targets, disbursement of counterpart funds at \nboth  the  provincial  and  district  levels,  and  a  summary  of  project  progress  monitoring  results. \nONPD  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  and  a  comprehensive  annual \nprogress  report  to  the  relevant  government  departments  and  ADB.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  ONPD  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  in  the  standard  ADB  format  and \nsubmit it to the Government and ADB. \n \n53. \nONPD and the PMUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  the  finance  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Consolidated \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  by  the  ONPD  and  audited \nannually  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts,  audit \nreport,  and  associated  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  9  months \nafter  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  In  line  with  ADB  policy  on  submission  of \naudited  accounts,  sanctions  are  mandatory  for  statements  submitted  to  ADB  more  than  6 \nmonths past due date, when imprest funds will not be replenished, and for statements submitted \nto ADB more than 12 months past due date, when loan disbursement will be suspended. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Management System  \n\n \n54. \nThe project performance management system (PPMS) as it relates to subprojects will be \napplied  by  the  PAFSOs  of  the  participating  provinces.  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nDOI,  with  the  assistance  of  the  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultant,  will  establish \nappropriate mechanisms and procedures for PPMS. The major framework for project reporting \nwill  be  based  on  a  matrix  showing  subprojects  and  the  status  of  implementation  activities, \nincluding  financial  and  physical  progress  and  completion  of  key  activities.  The  status  of \nsubprojects  at  the  district,  provincial,  and  national  levels  will  be  summarized  in  tables  and \ngraphs  to  give  an  overview  of  implementation.  Reports  will  indicate  problem  areas  and \nproposed  solutions.  The  initial  social,  economic,  and  environmental  surveys  carried  out  at  the \ntime of subproject appraisal will provide benchmark data and information for subsequent PPMS \nactivities.  The  national  project  director,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  integrate \nprovincial-level  data  into  the  overall  project  PPMS.  PPMS  findings  will  be  examined  and \nanalyzed by the national project director and reported in quarterly progress reports. The results \nwill be fed back to PAFSOs and DAFSOs in participating provinces and districts, as well as to \nCLOs and WUAs (Supplementary Appendix E has a list of monitoring indicators).  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n55. \nADB  will  carry  out  annual  project  reviews  to  assess  the  progress  and  impact,  and \nresolve  issues,  if  any.  In  addition,  ADB  representatives  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a \nmidterm  review  mission  in  the  third  year,  based  on  PPMS  findings.  The  mission  will  review \n(i) progress  of  the  Project,  including  planning  and  design,  beneficiary  participation,  physical \nworks,  quality  of  rehabilitation,  and  possibility \nfor  modifying  project  scope;  (ii) future \nloan  categories; \nimplementation  plans  and \n(iv) effectiveness  of  the  project  management  structure  and  implementation  arrangements; \n(v) environmental,  social,  economic,  and  technical  aspects  of  the  Project;  (vi) marketing \nconditions  and  prices  for  agricultural  produce;  and  (vii) compliance  with  loan  covenants  and \n\n(iii) allocation  of \n\nfunds  among \n\ntargets; \n\n\f18 \n\nreporting  requirements.  Based  on such  comprehensive  analysis,  the midterm  review  will  allow \nfor  necessary  midcourse  corrections  in  the  project  design  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation and achievement of the project objective. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\nA. \n \nThe most important overall impact of the Project will be an increase in food production \n56. \nand the potential for raising household incomes of poor households. By upgrading small-scale \nirrigation  schemes,  the  Project  is  expected  to  (i) ensure  better  irrigation  water  management, \nthereby increasing wet-season paddy yields; (ii) enable crop diversification and double cropping \nin the dry season; (iii) reduce the workload for the regular repair of diversion weirs; (iv) halt the \ncutting down of trees for weir repairs; and (v) expand the irrigation command areas for both the \nwet and dry seasons as a result of better diversion control and improved distribution systems. \nApproximately  30  irrigation  schemes  will  be  rehabilitated  involving  about  1,900  ha  of  irrigated \ncommand  area.  A  financial  analysis  has  estimated  substantial  incremental  financial  income  to \nbe generated in the sample subprojects, indicating that induced disposable farmer incomes can \nbe highly positive in the project area. The economic internal rates of return for the subprojects \nhave  been  calculated  at  12\u201319%.  The  calculated  quantifiable  cropping  benefits  demonstrate \nthat  substantial  economic  incentives  exist  for  farmers  to  diversify  crop  production,  once  they \nsatisfy  their  subsistence  needs.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  on  extreme  scenarios  have \nindicated that the results of economic analysis are fairly robust and exposed to marginal risk in \nall but the case of the Nam Pa Subproject in Luang Prabang province (Appendix 12).  \n \nB. \n \n57. \n The  Project  will  directly  assist  those  in  poor  villages  in  the  northern  region,  who  are \nsuffering  from  food  shortages  by  increasing  agricultural  production  through  the  provision  of \nimproved facilities for wet- and dry-season irrigation, combined with the introduction of improved \nfarming methods and better physical access. In total, around 37,000 rural villagers are expected \nto  benefit  from  the  Project,39  of  whom  at  least  60%  are  poor  farmers.40  The  estimated  2,700 \nhouseholds in the project area, who already have access to lowlands suitable for irrigation, will \nbe  the  main  project  beneficiaries.  They  are  subsistence  farmers  who  face  an  average  of  4 \nmonths of food insufficiency per year, and sometimes practice shifting cultivation in the uplands \nto  meet  their  subsistence  needs.41  The  Project  is  expected  to  reduce  food  shortages  from  an \nincrease in irrigated agriculture production, and consequently their swidden agriculture practices \nare  expected  to  be  substantially  reduced.  At  the  same  time,  approximately  4,800  households \nthat  do  not  have  access  to  irrigated  land  will  benefit  directly  from  increased  agricultural \nproduction in the uplands, community infrastructure improvements, and watershed management \nactivities,  and  indirectly  from  increased  agricultural  employment  opportunities  induced  by  the \nProject. Ethnic minority groups and women in particular are expected to benefit directly from the \nProject due to the proactive measures to encourage their participation facilitated by CLOs and \npriority targeting and monitoring of project activities for them. \n \n\nImpacts  \n\n                                                 \n39  The  total  number  of  participating  families  is  7,500,  and  the  average  size  of  a  family  in  the  project  area  is  5.2 \n\n40  The majority of families with irrigable lowland and most of the families without access to irrigable lowland are likely \n\npeople. \n\nto be poor. \n\n41  Approximately 75% of the communities surveyed produced rice to meet their needs for only 8 months each year. \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nRisks \n\nC. \n \n58. \nThe  major  potential  risks  to  the  Project\u2019s  impact  include  (i) inadequate  level  of  human \nresources  and  budgetary  allocation  made  available  for  relevant  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs  to \nsupport  project  activities  in  the  field,  and  (ii) degree  of  maturity  of  community  organization \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  provide  technical  assistance  and  allow  adequate  time  for \ninstitutional  capacity  building  of  both  the  local  government  agencies  and  community-based \norganizations,  and  encourage  an  enabling  regulatory  environment  for  WUA  development  and \nproductive  village  activities.  With  regard  to  implementation  capacity  risk  of  the  Executing \nAgency and PMUs, the Project will be implemented in three phases to ease the administrative \nwork  burden  and  to  enable  delivery  of  high-quality  assistance  for  the  implementation  of  each \nsubproject.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \nspecific assurances that will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  will  provide  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCounterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  adequate  provision  and \nprompt  disbursement  of  all  counterpart  funds  for  the  Project  through  timely \nsubmissions of annual budgetary appropriation requests of relevant government \nagencies  during  each  year  of  project  implementation.  PAFSO  and  DAFSO  staff \ninvolved in the Project will receive appropriate daily allowances and O&M costs \nfor  vehicles  in  a  timely  manner,  in  order  to  ensure  their  active  and  continuous \nparticipation in the Project. \nSocial Issues. Qualified project staff, including women and persons with ethnic \nminority  language  skills,  will  be  appointed  at  the  district  and  provincial  levels  to \nfacilitate  participation  of  vulnerable  groups  in  the  Project.  The  Government  will \nimplement  the  Guideline  for  Ethnic  Minorities  Participation  Framework  and  the \ncommunity  participation  development  plan.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nethnic  minority  groups,  who  have  irrigable  or  irrigated  lands  in  the  command \nareas of the subprojects, will continue to have secure access to these lands after \nsubproject  completion.  The  Government  will  ensure \ntimely \nimplementation of the gender plan, including promoting representation of women, \nparticularly ethnic minority women, in WUGs and WUAs, and full participation of \nwomen in extension activities and resulting benefits. \nDistrict  Lao  Women\u2019s  Unions.  DLWU  staff  will  work  under  the  supervision  of \nPMU,  act  in  an  autonomous  manner  without  any  involvement  of  the  Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union at the national level, and all payments for services rendered by \nthe DLWU will be made by the PMU direct to the DLWU.  \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Responsibility  of  Water  User  Associations. \nWUAs  are  responsible  for  the  routine  and  major  maintenance  of  rehabilitated \nirrigation facilities. However, the Government will bear rehabilitation costs of the \nirrigation schemes damaged by major floods. \nLand  Use  Rights.  Land  use  planning  under \nthe  agricultural  extension \ncomponent  will  be  carried  out  based  on  participatory  discussions  with  project \ninstruction \nbeneficiaries  and  district  authorities \nNo. 0822. Once an agricultural development plan is prepared for each subproject \nand  endorsed  by  the  district  authorities,  allocation  of  the  resource  use  rights \nwithin  each  village  will  be  officially  recognized,  and  honored  as  indicated  in  the \n\nin  accordance  with  MAF \n\nfull  and \n\nthe \n\n\f20 \n\nplan. The grace period for land tax payments and the condition for entitlement to \nland use rights will be ensured pursuant to Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 150. \n(vi)  Water  Use  Rights.  DOI  will  conduct  water  requirement  surveys  for  all  project \nirrigation  schemes  and  report  the  hydrological  data  to  WRCC;  the  water \nallocation  for  each  irrigation  scheme  will  be  reflected  in  the  allocation  of  water \nuse rights that MAF may perform in the future. \n\n(vii)  Resettlement. ADB will not approve the start of any civil works contracts for any \nsubproject to be financed by the loan unless resettlement plans are satisfactorily \nprepared  and  disclosed  to  affected  persons  by  the  Government  in  accordance \nwith the resettlement framework, and approved by ADB. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Environmental Issues. The Government will implement the measures described \nin  the  environmental  management  plan.  At  least  one  full-time  environmental \nspecialist will be assigned within ONPD and each PAFSO or DAFSO. Identified \nadverse  impact  mitigation  measures  will  be  properly  implemented,  and  relevant \ntraining  will  be  given  to  relevant  project  staff  and  farmers  as  a  part  of  project \nagricultural extension activities. \nUnexploded  Ordnance  Clearance.  Prior  to  the  start  of  project  works,  all  new \nland prepared for irrigation and the alignment of new village access roads will be \nsurveyed and, if necessary, cleared of UXO according to accepted international \npractices. \nEstablishment  of  Office  of  National  Project  Director.  The  present  principal \nONPD staff of CMIS will be assigned to ONPD prior to ADB board consideration \nto ensure that institutional experience and capacity gained through CMIS will be \nappropriately transferred to the Project. \n\n(x) \n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB. \n \n60. \nA  PMU  will  be  established  in  each  project  province.  For  those  provinces  where  CMIS \nwas implemented, CMIS project managers and staff at the provincial and district levels will be \ndesignated  as  PMU  staff  of  the  Project.  Each  of  the  five  PMUs  will  have  at  least  a  full-time \nirrigation  engineer,  a  full-time  agricultural  extension  specialist,  a  full-time  qualified  accountant, \nand a full-time social and environmental impact-monitoring specialist. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n61. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  6,864,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  for  the  Northern  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n \n\n09 June 2004 \n\n\f \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nIncidence of rural poverty among \nproject beneficiaries by 25% by \n2012 \n\n \n \n\u2022 \n \n \n\u2022  Food security improved by 2012 \n-  Full security for all irrigating farmers  \n-  Reduction of rice deficiency periods \n \n \n \n\nby 2 months for nonirrigating \nfarmers  \n\n\u2022  Rice yield improvement by 2009 \n-  From 2.0 to 3.0 t/ha for wet season  \n-  From 3.2 to 4.5 t/ha for dry season \n \n\u2022  Cropping area expanded by 2009 \n-  About 1,900 ha of irrigated area in \n\nwet season cultivation \n\n-  About 200 ha of irrigated area for dry \n\nseason cultivation  \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \nInitial social \n\u2022 \n \nanalysis \n\u2022  Project \n \n \n\u2022  PCR \n\u2022  PPAR  \n\u2022  LECS census \n\ncompletion \nsurvey \n\n\u2022  Baseline \nsurvey \n\n\u2022  PPMS reports \n\u2022  PCR \n\u2022  WUA records \n\u2022  MAF annual \nagricultural \nstatistics \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022  Project \n\nprogress \nreport \n\n\u2022  Community \ngroups\u2019 \nrecords \n\u2022  Review \n\nmissions \n\u2022  PMU and \n\nONPD site \nvisits \n\u2022  Training \n\nevaluation \n\n\u2022  WUA \n\nregistrations \n\n\u2022  Community-level organizers (one \nmale and one female) selected in \neach project community by 2006 \n\n\u2022  WUAs established at about 30 \nsubproject sites by 2007 \nFarmer producer groups \nestablished for both irrigated and \nupland extension activities by 2006 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Road committees and rural water \n\nsupply groups established by 2006 \n\n\u2022  DAFSO staff acquire social \n\nfacilitation skills and relevant \ntechnical knowledge \n\u2022  ONPD, 5 PAFSOs, and 11 \n\nDAFSOs start providing effective \nirrigation scheme planning, O&M \nassistance to project communities \nby 2005 \n5 PAFSOs and 11 DAFSOs \neffectively plan and provide both \nirrigated and upland extension \nservices  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  CLOs understand feasible options \nof community activities, acquire \nbasic technical knowledge of each \ncommunity activities, are ready to \neffectively lead community \ndiscussions  \n\nGoal: \n \nReduction of rural \npoverty in 11 districts of \nnorthern Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic \nthrough increased \nagricultural production. \n\nPurpose: \nImproved agricultural \nproduction and wage-\nearning opportunities \ngenerated in the project \narea. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOutputs: \n1.

The studied schemes \nhave an average catchment area of 66 hectares (ha), where an existing traditional weir provides \nwater  for  22  ha  of  command  area  on  average  during  the  wet  season.  On  the  other  hand,  dry \nseason  cropping  potential  is  small  in  the  project  area  due  to  limited  dry  season  flow:  roughly \n13% of existing irrigated areas is expected to be available for rice and diversified crop cultivation \n(Supplementary Appendix J). \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Demand \n\n \n2. \nWith their traditional irrigation schemes, farmers in the project area are currently suffering \nfrom  (i) frequent  damage  to  the  schemes  by  floods  that  require  labor  works  and  materials  for \nrepair several times a year; (ii) low efficiency of existing weirs particularly during the dry season; \nand (iii) low capacity of existing weirs in expanding command areas. Over the last 20 years, the \nexperience  of  major  funding  agencies  in  the  sector  demonstrated  that  the  replacement  of \ntraditional  weirs  by  permanent  structures  could  effectively  improve  efficiency  of  water  use  and \nreduce  substantially  the  labor  requirement  for  repairs.  In  general,  this  assistance  for  small-scale \ncommunity-managed  irrigation  schemes  has  been  successful  because  they  simply  improve  a \ntraditional system,  already  well  known  to farmers,  as  opposed  to trying to introduce  entirely new \nconcepts  such  as  pumping  irrigation.  Upgrading  small-scale  schemes  without  changing  the \ntraditional  gravity-fed  design  has  also  allowed  most  of  poor  farming  communities  to  operate  the \nupgraded  schemes  in  a  sustainable  manner,  because  of  its  relatively  economical  expenditure \nrequirements  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M). 1  Any  schemes  that  require  high  cash \nexpenditures for O&M cannot be sustainable where the scope for cash crop development is limited \ndue to rice deficiency, small dry-season flow, and limited access to local markets. \n \n3. \nThe total investment required for the civil works of the 73 schemes in the long list, including \nsurvey,  design,  and  supervision,  is  estimated  to  be  about  $10.3 million.2 Given  the  size  of  the \nfinancing resources, the Project is expected to finance about 30 subprojects. In order to facilitate \nactive  community  participation  throughout  the  project  implantation  period  and  to  ensure \nsustainability and community ownership in the process, the Project needs to invest in community \ninstitution-building  efforts  and  extension  assistance  to  complement  the  impacts  of  the  irrigation \ninvestment as well. \n \n\n3. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \n\n4. \nThe approach is to select schemes in poorer areas among technically feasible irrigation \nscheme development options in the northern provinces in order to maximize impacts on poverty \n                                                 \n1 Gravity-fed  schemes  require  routine  labor  works  for  weir  and  gates,  and  both  intake  and  sluice  gates  need  to  be \nreplaced  every  7  years.  On  the  other  hand,  pumping  schemes  require  diesel  or  electricity  for  their  operation  and \npumps need to be replaced every 8 years. Estimated annual O&M costs for Nam Pa scheme in Luang Prabang, for \ninstance, is $25 per ha for a gravity-fed scheme (KKU-Lao weir), and $155 per ha for a diesel pump scheme, which \nis way above what farmers can afford. \n2 The survey, design, and supervision costs are estimated to be about 15% of civil works, and required local material \nand labor cost is about 10% of civil works. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n \n\nthe  beneficiaries  about \n\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework \n\nreduction. In support of integrated water resource management approach, locations that would \noverstretch the water flow available in each river basin will be avoided, and the schemes with \ncommunities  that  understand  the  concept  of  irrigation  management  transfer  (IMT)  and \ndemonstrate community ownership will be selected to ensure sustainability of irrigation facilities \nand  their  tangible  development  impacts.  Specific  selection  criteria  include:  (i) over  half  of  the \ntotal  village  population  in  each  subproject  are  poor,  which  can  be  measured  by  the  national \npoverty line and/or household rice insufficiency of more than one month; (ii) the command area \nper  subproject  of  10\u2013100  ha;  (iii) the  construction  cost  per  hectare,  including  all  imported \nmaterial, local material, and labor costs up to $2,500; (iv) the economic internal rate of return for \neach  subproject  of  12%  or  higher;  (v) the  availability  of  water  of  suitable  quality  (a  continuous \nflow of 4 liters/second per ha of irrigated area), and minimal negative impact on the environment \nor the downstream water users; (vi) no existing or proposed protected areas or other designated \nforestry  or  wildlife  reserve/sanctuary  included  in  the  geographical  coverage  of  any  subproject; \nand  (vii) understanding  and  agreement  of  all \ntheir  expected \nresponsibilities during the construction, O&M of irrigation schemes, and their contribution in the \namount agreed as an appropriate irrigation service fee.3  A subproject selection flowchart is in \nFigure A2.1. \n \nB. \n \nThe  national  irrigation  sector  development  strategy  in  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \n5. \nRepublic (Lao PDR) has been refined based on the national agriculture sector strategy, which \nwas  developed  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance,  to  focus  on  irrigation \nmanagement  transfer,  community  managed  irrigation,  water  resource  planning,  integrated \nassistance  with  extension,  and  irrigation  technology.  Specifically,  the  Government  aims  to \n(i) intensify  and  expand  dry  season  irrigation  in  the  flatlands  as  a  major  input  to  boost \nagricultural productivity and create market-driven farming system, and (ii) expand and intensity \nsmall-scale  community-managed  irrigation  systems  in  order  to  assist  rural  households  to \nachieve food security and diversify their farming systems in the sloping lands. \n \n6. \nIrrigation  Management  Transfer.  Transfer  of  ownership  and  O&M  responsibility  of \nirrigation  schemes  by  supporting  establishment  and  strengthening  of  water  user  associations \n(WUAs)  is  central  to  the  Government\u2019s  irrigation  subsector  development  strategy.  Prime \nMinisterial  Order  No. 26  (PMO 26)  issued  in  December  1998  directed  that  all  publicly \nmaintained irrigation systems be transferred to local communities, which would be responsible \nfor (i) O&M and (ii) repayment of a part of capital investment costs required for irrigation system \nimprovement.  PMO  26  laid  the  foundations  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and \nManagement  Project  (DIDM),  which  supported  institutional  and  regulatory  environment \nimprovement  required  for  implementation  of  the  IMT  policy.  The  regulation  necessitates  WUA \nmembers to begin making payments into a local village development fund (VDF) from the day \nthe  ownership  of  irrigation  systems  is  transferred  from  the  Government  to  local  WUAs.  This \nrequirement  applies  to  all  farmers  throughout  the  country  who  own  land  served  by  irrigation \nfacilities,  unless  the  irrigation  facilities  were  developed  by  private  funds.  The  intent  of \nestablishing  a  VDF  was  to  allow  government  funding  directed  at  a  small  number  of \ncommunities,  to  be  redistributed  across  wider  communities,  and  to  finance  O&M  costs  of  the \nirrigation schemes. \n \n7. \nCost Recovery. Under the IMT policy, a portion of capital investment costs required for \nirrigation scheme development is to be recovered through collection of an irrigation service fee \n(ISF) from WUA members of government-funded irrigation schemes. However, an estimation of \n                                                 \n3 Where  applicable,  least-cost  analysis  of  optional  schemes  will  be  undertaken  to  minimize  the  capital  investment \ncosts. Subproject proposals with higher unit cost than the ceiling cost will be submitted to ADB for approval. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFigure A2.1: Irrigation Subproject Selection Criteria \n\n(i)  Short-listing of the potential subprojects in accordance with major  \n \n(ii)  No existing or proposed protected areas or other designated forestry or \n\nsubproject selection criteria based on available data \n\nwildlife reserve/sanctuary included in any subproject \n\n(iii)  Adequate advertisement and information dissemination about the project \n\nand explanation about benefits and future responsibilities through \ncommunity mobilization activities \n\n(iv)  Water use groups express initial willingness to contribute labour and \n\nmaterials for construction and O&M \n\n \nConditions for start: \n\u2022  Request form adequately completed\n\nIDENTIFICATION SURVEY\n\n(i)  Command area 10 ha to 100 ha \n(ii)  At least 50% of project beneficiaries are \n\npoor according to the national poverty line, \nverified by Initial Social Analysis \n(iii)  Water quantity and quality (4 l/s/ha) \n(iv)  No potential for water dispute among \n\nupstream and downstream communities \n\n(v)  Simple Lao PDR standard designs can be \n\nused \n(vi)  Community \n\nresources equitably \n\n \n\ncan \n\nidentify \n\nneeds \n\nand\n\nrequired \n\nscheme develops new irrigated areas on non \nallocated land) \n\n(vii)  Agree to pay irrigation service fee (ISF), if one is \n \n (viii)  Initial agreement on equitable land allocation (if \n \n \n  (ix)  WUGs are registered as WUAs with women\u2019s \nparticipation and submit request for feasibility \n \n \nstudy \n   (x)  No potential water conflict within the same river  \n \n  (xi)  Annual CMI budget per province according to \n \n\nprovince capacity  \n\nbasin \n\nFEASIBILITY STUDY\n\n(i)  Establishment of a village team to participate in \nthe   survey and design (irrigation + road + \n \n \nwater supply) \n(ii)  $2,500/ha max.

Thus, in order to achieve the effective \ntransfer and sustainable use of irrigation schemes, WUAs associated with small-scale irrigation \nschemes  should  focus  on  the  fee  collection  from  WUA  members  to  fully  finance  the  cost  of \nfuture  maintenance.  In  support  of  such  an  initiative,  the  Government  issued  a  ministerial \nguideline No. 0672 in August 2003 in order to indicate that the payment responsibility of WUAs \nwith  small-scale  irrigation  schemes  is  limited  to  collection  of  ISF  to  finance  solely  the  future \nO&M  costs  of  their  schemes.  At  the  same  time,  the  guideline  made  a  provision  to  allow  each \nWUA to decide its ISF level based on its future maintenance requirement, as O&M requirements \nvary significantly depending on the design and scale of irrigation schemes.4 \n \n8. \nLand Tenure. Unclear allocation of land use rights of sloping lands is a major constraint to \npermanent and sustainable cultivation of sloping-land and catchment area protection activities in \nrural  villages.  This  prevents  communities  from  optimizing  the  use  of  available  production \nresources.  Upland  areas  surrounding  the  lowlands  and  community  land  suited  to  sustainable \nagricultural  use  is  often  not  used  effectively,  mainly  due  to  a  lack  of  mechanisms  to  allocate \nuser rights for such land, thereby discouraging its productive use by farmers. The Land Law of \nJune 1997 specifies that the national community owns land, and individuals have the right to use \nland,  provided  they  use  it  continuously  and  effectively.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is \nresponsible  for  land  management  including  land  registration,  land  titling,  and  leasing.  Although \nMOF  has  started  issuing  land  ownership  titles  supported  by  the  land  titling  project  of  the  World \nBank, the project assistance focuses only on titling of irrigable lowlands and it will take many years \nbefore land titling becomes available in the remote mountainous villages. With regard to land use \nrights,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  is  authorized  to  issue  land  certificates  to \nlegally indicate user rights for those who have used land continuously for a period of 3 years for \nagricultural  production.  The  allocation  of  such  land  use  rights  is  the  responsibility  of  district \nadministrations. These land certificates are initially issued to families for a period of 3 years, and \nsubsequently  the  families  will  retain  the  rights  to  the  use  of  the  lands  provided  they  continue  to \nfarm the lands.5 As land use certificates are not issued for sloping lands, farmers do not have any \nincentive \nlands. \nConsequently, sloping land suitable for sustainable and long-term crop production such as tree \ncrop production and forage cultivation is often left uncultivated. In the potential project area, the \nuser rights of almost all the irrigable land have already been allocated to individuals, and there will \nbe  no  scope  for  redistributing  newly  irrigated  land.  In  order  to  materialize  the  effective  and \nsustainable use of productive land in the project area, the Government ensured that (i) the land \nuse planning will be carried out for both lowlands and sloping lands adjutant to irrigation schemes, \nin  a  participatory  and  equitable  manner  with  full  participation  of  villagers  as  stipulated  in  MAF \ninstruction No. 0822 issued in August 1996, and (ii) the grace period for land tax collection will be \nexercised in accordance with Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 150. \n \n9. \nWater  Use  Rights.  Although  the  Water  Law  was  adopted  in  October  1996  and  Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Decree  No. 204  was  issued  in  October  2001  (PM. 204)  to  guide  law  enforcement, \nmechanisms for enforcement have not been developed at present. While informal arrangements \nfor the water use exist, officially recognized water rights, as such, are not yet in place. Although \nconflicts between competing uses of water are rarely seen because of the country\u2019s good fortune \n                                                 \n4  The  maintenance  for  small-scale  and  gravity-fed  irrigation  schemes  requires  labor  contribution  and  limited  fee \ncollection  in  form  of  cash  to  purchase  imported  materials  for  periodic  maintenance.  While  the  current  ISF  for \ngravity-fed  schemes  is  set  at  150  kg/ha/year,  future  maintenance  costs  required  for  small-scale  schemes  range \nfrom 135 to 175 kg/ha/year. The estimated costs include cash expenditures for routine maintenance and periodic \nmaintenance in 15th year required for weir and canal rehabilitation. \n\nto  establish  permanent  and  sustainable  cropping  systems  on  sloping \n\n5   If the family ceases to practice farming, the relevant district authority may reallocate the land to others. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nin  having  abundant  water  resources,  conflicts  in  water  allocation  could  arise  in  the  future, \nparticularly during the dry season, as upgraded irrigation facilities increase. Thus, an integrated \nwater resource management approach to the future irrigation development is critical. To this end, \nthe Department of Irrigation (DOI) will survey water requirements of each subproject for both the \nwet and dry seasons, plan future irrigation development for each river basin in line with relevant \nriver  basin  development  plan  in  close  coordination  with  the  Water  Resource  Coordination \nCommittee  (WRCC)  and  local  authorities,  periodically  report  the  data  to  the  WRCC  and  the \nrespective offices of the provincial and district governor as evidence of historical water use, and \neventually obtain a water use license for each irrigation scheme in accordance with PM. 204.  \n \nC. \n\nIntegrated Approach to Agricultural Development \n\n \nIntegration  of  extension  services  with  irrigation  development  will  more  effectively \n10. \nimprove  development  impacts,  and  is  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  development \nstrategy.  Given  the  better  control  over  water  resources  with  upgraded  irrigation  facilities,  the \nProject  also  needs  to  support  participating  communities  in  planning  their  land  and  water \nresource  use  to  optimize  the  utilization  of  available  resources.  Extension  assistance  in  the \nnorthern  provinces  needs  to  be  formulated  in  participatory  and  flexible  modalities  as  farming \nconditions  significantly  vary  from  village  to  village.  Extension  packages  will  be  developed  and \ndelivered through good coordination between relevant community-level organizers (CLOs) and \ndistrict  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office  (DAFSO)  and  province  agriculture  and  forestry \nservice office (PAFSO) staff to ensure that the packages address the pressing livelihood needs \nof project beneficiaries. Active participation of CLOs is a key to development of demand-driven \nand effective extension systems in rural areas. \n \n11. \nDelivery  of  such  extension  services  and  land  use  planning  will  be  carried  out  in \npartnership  with  qualified  institutions  with  adequate  relevant  experience  so  as  to  enhance \noutreach to farmers in the project area. The Lao PDR has several institutions with good practical \nknowledge  in  specialized  areas,  such  as  the  National  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Research \nInstitute (NAFRI) and the Lao International Rice Research Institute (Lao IRRI) for rice varieties \nsuitable  for  irrigated  and  upland  cultivation,  seed  multiplication,  drying  and  pest-free  storage \ntechniques;  the  Agriculture  Development  Center  that  has  knowledge  provided  by  Thailand \nextension  experts  and  training  facilities  for  tree  and  vegetable  cropping,  livestock,  and \naquaculture; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that has local \nknowledge  of  kitchen  gardening,  cash  crops,  food  production,  and  nutrition  management,  and \ngender  mainstreaming  training  in  agriculture;  the  Integrated  Upland  Agriculture  Resource \nProject implemented by International Rice Research Institute, International Center for Research \non  Agro-Forestry,  International  Center  for  Tropical  Agriculture,  and  Commonwealth  Scientific \nand  Industrial  Research  Organization  has  upland  production-enhancing  technology  packages; \nand  the  Lao  Extension  for  Agriculture  Project  that  has  been  training  master  trainers  for \nextension  services  on  various  technical  areas.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Project  will  use \nexisting  and  high-quality  extension  and  training  materials  and  services  available  from  these \nexisting agricultural research institutions and training centers. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nActive participation of beneficiaries will be sought during the survey and design stage of \neach  community-managed  irrigation  scheme.  A  social  analysis  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance revealed that farmers have a good knowledge of the water availability, the \ngeneral topography of the land, and the irrigation requirements. By providing inputs during the \npreparation  stage,  the  project  beneficiaries  will  increase  their  sense  of  ownership,  and  their \nextensive knowledge of the project area will improve the design work and ensure the proposed \n\nLeast-Cost Design and Alignment Selection \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n \n\nCMI scheme is in line with farmers\u2019 expectations. Similarly, alignment finalization will be carried \nout by DAFSO and PAFSO staff through village walks with the project beneficiaries so that the \nmost  economical  and  socially  sensible  alignment  will  be  selected.  The  scope  of  contractors\u2019 \nwork  will  be  decided  in  consultation  with  the  participating  communities  with  regard  to  material \nand labor availability, technical challenges, and time required for works, and contractors will be \nused  only  when  work  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  communities  as  determined  by  the \ncommunities.  \n \nBased  on  village  discussions,  DAFSO  and  PAFSO  engineers  will  explore  technically \n13. \npossible  designs,  estimate  the  initial  investment  requirement  and  cost  implication  for  O&M  for \neach potential design, and select the least-cost design with participating communities to ensure \nefficiency  and  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation  schemes.  As  a  sample  case,  a  least-cost \nanalysis has been carried out for Nam Pa scheme, which will supply water to 60 ha of command \narea  during  the  wet  season.  The  analysis  findings  indicate  that  the  gravity-fed  scheme  (KKU-\nLao  weir)  is  the  most  economical  investment  option,  and  the  most  financially  sustainable \nbecause of the affordable level of annual O&M costs and the ISF requirement (Table A2.1).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Design Options for Nam Pa Scheme (scheme life of 30 years) \n \n\nDesign \n\nKKU-Lao Weir \n\nGabion Weir \n\nDiesel Pump \n\nMain Canal \nCommand Area \nInitial Investment Cost (1) \nTotal maintenance cost (2) \nPump operation cost (3) \nTotal (1) + (2) + (3) \n(Cumulative over 30 yrs) \nAnnual Regular O&M \n\nMajor Maintenance \n\n6 km \n65 ha \n$279,625 \n$49,460 \n \n$329,085 \n\n$320 \n\nWeir: $5,130 (year 15) \nGates: $7,400 (every 7 \nyrs) \n$1,649 \n$25 \n$26.44 \n(286 kg) \n\n6 km \n65 ha \n$247,034 \n$116,490 \n \n$363,524 \n\n$416 \n\n4 km \n65 ha \n$162,918 \n$85,320 \n$216,480 \n$464,718 \n\nGabion wire: $17,451 \n(Every 5 yrs) \n\nPump operation: $7,216 \nMaintenance: $ 400 \nPump units: $24,400 \n(Every 8 yrs) \n\n$3,883 \n$60 \n$60.10 \n(649 kg) \n\n$10,060 \n$155 \n$164.09 \n(1,772 kg) \n\nCapacity of Participating Communities \n\nAverage annual O&M cost \nAnnual O&M cost per ha \nRequired ISF collection/ \nha/year in cash (rice) \nha = hectare; ISF = irrigation service fee; kg = kilogram; O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n \n14.  Many  farming  communities  in  the  project  area  have  a  long  history  of  operating  and \nmaintaining traditional small-scale irrigation systems. Strong community support and ownership \nin  the  proposed  project  activities  have  been  confirmed  during  community  consultations \nthroughout  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  implementation  and  the  project \nprocessing. The technical aspects of operating and maintaining rehabilitated irrigation schemes \nare expected to be well within the capacities of those villages as long as farmers develop clear \nunderstanding on the design and the operating method of upgraded irrigation systems through \ntheir  involvement  in  the  design  and  construction  works,  and  training  on  O&M  and  water \nmanagement. \n \nF. \n \n15.  Water  Management  within  Communities.  In  traditional  irrigation  schemes  the  water \nflowing into main canals and into fields are generally uncontrolled, with a supposition that \u201cthe more \nwater, the better the effect\u201d. New permanent weirs will allow better control over diverted water flow \ninto the main canal, enabling communities to plan and manage optimal water allocation. In order to \n\nIntroduction of Water Resource Management \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nenhance irrigation efficiency, increase yields of wet season crops, and better prevent damages \ncaused  by  normal  floods,  better  water  use  management  practices  need  to  be  introduced  to \ncommunities.  By  operating  lift-gates  and  water  control  structures  of  main  canals  (check,  drop, \ndivision box, farm turnout, etc.), communities can adjust and divert only the required flow. Although \nthe Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project (CMIS) trained WUA members on the principles \nof  water  management  systems  operation,  some  project  communities  can  share  their  water \nresources  more  effectively  among  upper  irrigation  blocks  and  tail-end  irrigation  blocks  by \norganizing  water  rotation  systems  through  controlling  inlet  gates.  Many  WUA  members  still  also \nneed to be reminded of proper water flow control during floods to prevent canal and other structure \ndamages. \n \n16. \nIn  order  to  optimize  water  use  in  the  communities,  WUAs  need  to  develop  systematic \nmanagement functions to (i) record water flow periodically, (ii) plan water allocation and cropping \npattern based on water flow estimates, and (iii) control system of water flow. These activities need \ntechnical supports from relevant PAFSO and DAFSO staff, and will be carried out in conjunction \nwith the development of the agricultural development plan for each subproject area.  \n \n17.  Where relevant and feasible, a WUA and a rural water supply group can also jointly take a \nholistic approach to community water management, and plan and monitor an optimal allocation of \nwater  use  within  the  community.  This  arrangement  will  also  facilitate  all  villagers\u2019  participation \nincluding representation of the poorest groups, and provide a social facility to discuss water-related \nissues within a community.  \n \n18. \nRiver-based Integrated Water Management Approach. Of the long-listed 73 potential \nsubproject sites, 22 subprojects are to share the same water source either with other long-listed \nsubproject or with other existing projects. At present, water conflict among irrigation schemes is \nnot  an  issue,  largely  because  traditional  wooden  weirs  themselves  have  played  a  proper \nregulating  role  to  avoid  social  conflicts  in  the  dry  season  due  to  the  limited  capacity  of  and \nnatural leakages from weirs. For modern irrigation scheme, however, a control measure for the \nwater  diversion  needs  to  be  included  in  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  avoid  negative \nimpacts on downstream users. 6  \n \nG. \n \n19.  Management  of  WUAs  and  farmer  production  groups  need  to  be  accountable  to  their \nmembers, and transparency in their decision making process must be ensured in order to keep \nsound  incentives  for  farmers  to  continue  their  participation.  Eventually,  WUAs  and  farmer \ngroups  should  elect \nto  have  adequate \naccountability  and  transparency  in  managing  the  collected  fund  to  sustain  both  optimal \noperations of irrigation facilities and farmers\u2019 good incentive to pay the fee. A good bookkeeping \npractice is required to record the fee collection from WUA members and cash expenditures to \npurchase imported materials required for maintenance works. Group discussions to decide the \nuse  of  expenditures,  periodical  election  of  village  leaders  and  WUA  committee  members  are \nalso required in order to provide farmers with opportunities to evaluate the performance of their \nelected leaders. \n \n\nleaders  and  management.  WUA  needs \n\nGood Governance \n\ntheir \n\n                                                 \n6  The subproject selection criteria will restrict the diversion of the dry season stream flow at a weir at no more than \n50%. Considering the fact that 50% or less of the flow is diverted, and that a portion of this diverted flow returns to \nthe stream, the impact on the downstream users should be minimal, if any. \n\n\fTA 1189: Irrigation Sub-sector Review \n\n0.132  National level \n\n31 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR \n\nProject Name \n\nLocation \n\nPeriod \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank \nLoan 1448: Community Managed Irrigation (with OPEC \ncofinancing) \n\nLoan 1688: Shifting Cultivation Stabilization Project (with \nUNDCP cofinancing) \n\nLoan 1788: Decentralized Irrigation Development and \nManagement (with AFD cofinancing) \n\n \nLoan 1933: Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector \n\nTA 1764: Strengthening and Restructuring Irrigation \nDevelopment  \n\nTA 1745/2333: Institutional Development and \nStrengthening of MAF (Phase 1 and 2) \nTA 2883: Agricultural Strategy Study \nTA 1765: National Integrated Agricultural Extension and \nResearch Program \nTA 3006: Institutional Strengthening of Water Resources \nCoordination Committee \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \nFarmers Irrigated Agricultural Training (with UNDP \ncofinancing) \nXiengkhouang Integrated Rural  \nDevelopment Project (with UNCDP cofinancing) \nOudomxai Community Initiatives Support Project \nNorthern Xaignabouri Rural Development (with AFD \ncofinancing) \nNetherlands (through Mekong River Commission) \nSustainable Irrigated Agriculture  \n\nWorld Bank \nAgriculture Development \nEuropean Union \nLuangprabang Micro-project Phase II \n\n \n\n1997\u20132003 \n\n \n2000\u20132005 \n\n2002\u20132007 \n\n2003\u20132008 \n\n1990 \n\n1996\u20131997 \n1992\u20131993 \n\n1998\u20131999 \n\n1992\u20132000 \n\n1999\u20132004 \n\n2002\u20132009 \n1997\u20132004 \n\n14.7 \n\n5.6 \n\n15.5 \n\n15.0 \n\nVientiane, Huaphanh \nBolikhamxai, and Xiengkhuang \nProvinces and Xaysomboun S. \nZone \nHuaphanh Province \nXam Neua District \n \nXayabury, Luangprabang, \nVientiane, Vientiane Prefecture, \nBolikhamxai and Savannakhet \nVientiane, Xiengkhuang, and \nXaisomboun Special Zone \n\n2.56 \n\nNational and all provinces \n\n1993\u20131998 \n\n1.29 \n\nNational and all provinces \n\n1994\u20131995 \n\n0.60 \n0.41 \n\nNational  \nNational Level \n\n 0.26 \n\nNational Level \n\n0.7 \n\n5 \n\n18.7 \n5.3 \n\nVientiane M, Bolikhamxai, \nSavannakhet, Khammouane \nXiengkhuang \nAll districts  \nOudomxay, all districts \nXayabury 4 northern districts \n\n4.08 \n\nVientiane Municipality, \nKhammouan, and Savannakhet \n\n1992\u20131996 \n\n16.7 \n\nAttapeu, and Champassak \n\n2001\u20132006 \n\n\u20ac12.8 \n\nLuang Prabang, Pak Ou, Phon \nXay and Pak Xeng districts in \nLuangprabang  \n\n1996\u20132002 \n\nUnited Nations Development Programme/ United Nations Capital Development Project \nEco-Development Irrigation \nNam Tan Sustainable Watershed Management \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) \nRural Development  \n(Phase II under processing) \nTan Pioa Irrigation \nLuxemburg \nIntegrated Development \nNongovernment Organizations \nFood for the Hungry International: Small Scale Irrigation \n\nOudomxai  \nXayabury \n\n\u20ac5.1 \n(\u20ac3.8) \n\u20ac4.2 \n\nBolikhamxai  \n\nPhongsaly \n\nHuaphanh \n\nVientiane \n\n3.6 \n1.9 \n\n\u20ac3.9 \n\n \n\nOngoing \nsince 1990 \nOngoing \nQuaker Service Lao PDR: Small Scale Irrigation and \nFamily irrigation  \nsince 1979 \nAFD= Agence Francaise de Developpement; MAF = Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; OPEC = Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries; UNDP = United Nations Development Programme. \nSource: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. \n\nOudomxai and Phongsali \n\n \n\n1997\u20132003 \n1999 \u2013 2003 \n\n1996\u20132002 \n2003\u2013  \n2000\u20132005 \n\n2000\u20132004 \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR):  \n \nThe Government\u2019s goals are to reduce poverty by 50% by 2005, to eradicate it by 2010, and to enable the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) to graduate from being a least developing country to a developing country by 2020. The \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Lao  PDR  and  the  poverty  reduction \npartnership  agreement  signed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  in  2001  state  that  efforts  will  be  directed  toward  reducing \npoverty  by  broadening  community  participation  and  opportunities  during  the  next  5  years.  The  operational  priorities  to \nachieve  these  goals  are  (i) rural  development  and  market  linkages,  (ii) human  resource  development,  (iii) sustainable \nenvironmental management, and (iv) regional integration. The Project aims to contribute to these operational priorities by \n(i) improving  food  production  by  developing  cost-effective  and  sustainable  farmer  managed  irrigation  schemes, \n(ii) enhancing  human  development  by  providing  the  enabling  environment  for  more  effective  community  participation  in \nrural  development  activities,  (iii) environmentally  appropriate  extension  activities  in  the  uplands  promoting  sustainable \nenvironmental management of local resources, and (iv) promotion of regional integration via support for a more farmer-\ncentered agricultural extension service. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCore Poverty Intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nOf an estimated population of 5.5 million in the Lao PDR, about 30% live below the poverty \nline. This is defined as being where a person cannot access the equivalent of 2,100 calories \nin foodstuffs or the equivalent of KN142,500 per month or less than US$0.50 per day. The \nLao  PDR  defines  this  as  the  food  poverty  line.  The  Lao  PDR  also  differentiates  between \naverage  poverty  lines  for  urban  and  rural  areas  and  between  different  regions.  The  per \ncapita per month poverty line is upward of 30% higher in Vientiane than in the rural areas of \nthe Lao PDR. The poorest province in the project area is the northern province of Huaphanh \n(74.6%),  followed  by  Xaysomboun  Special  Region  (55%),  Luang  Prabang  (49.4%), \nXiengkhuang  (34.9%)  and  Xayabury  (21.2%)  living  below  the  poverty  line.  For  the  project \narea as a whole an estimated 45% of the population lives in poverty. If the urban population \nis excluded in these provinces over half the rural population is living in poverty. The project \narea  also  contains  some  of  the  severest  forms  of  poverty  (ultra-poor)  in  the  Lao  PDR. \nHuaphanh has the most severe form of poverty (11.3% of people) followed by Xaysomboun \nSpecial Region (7.1%) and Luang Prabang (4.7%). The regional percentage at 6.8% is the \nhighest in the Lao PDR (4%) . \n\n \nFor  the  selected  districts  in  the  project  area  the  incidence  of  poverty  ranges  from  88%  in \nSobbao  (Huaphanh)  to  13.6%  in  Thong  Mixay  (Xayabury).  However,  in  the  latter  district \nthere  are  villages  where  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  quite  high  (44%).  Additionally  in  the \nother  district  of  Xayabury\u2014despite  the  relatively  low  incidence  of  poverty  on  a  provincial \nbasis (in part due to its close proximity to Thailand)\u2014there are several villages that would \nlikely  be included in this Project  with  a  high incidence  of poverty (over 60%). Typically  all \ndistricts in the project area have some villages where the incidence of poverty is quite low \nand other villages where it is quite high. Villages or those households in villages that have \naccess to allocated land or land that could be allocated for irrigation are somewhat better \noff than villages or those  households  within  the  same villages that do not have  access  to \nlowland  suitable  for  irrigation.  The  subprojects  would  likely  include  such  villages  or  a \ncombination of villages. \n  \nRice-deficit  months  have  been  used  as  one  of  the  key  quantitative  indexes  to  assess  the \nextent  of  poverty  in  the  project  area.  Of  the  different  ethnic  groups  where  over  80%  of \nhouseholds  are  classified  as  poor  it  is  more  likely  that  the  lowland  Lao  and  Hmong \nexperience  some  form  of  rice  shortage.  However,  in  all  other  villages  where  over  20%  of \nhouseholds are living in poverty these villages are likely to be where the Khmou are found \nin  the  majority.  The  Khmou  nationally  have  an  average  rice  sufficiency  of  5.9  months \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4        33            \n\n \n\ncompared to the Hmong of 8.1 months and the lowland Lao of 9 months. In the project area \nthe  variation  will  occur  on  a  village-by-village  basis  dependent  on  what  access  to  land \nsuitable  for  irrigation  that  the  different  ethnic  groups  have  access  to.  Household  food \ninsecurity needs to be measured not simply by lack of rice but days on which households or \nspecific members of households (e.g., mothers going  without food to feed  young children) \nstate  they  actually  experience  hunger.  There  may  or  may  not  be  food  deficits  on  an \noccasional basis but there is nowhere in the project area where people will go without food. \nHouseholds  will  make  up  for  the  shortfall  in  agricultural  production\u2014irrespective  of  their \nethnic  background\u2014by  using  forest  resources  for  subsistence  and  income  generation. \nBamboo shoots, frogs, fish, and red-ant eggs are all examples of edible foodstuffs that are \ngathered from the forest to make up this deficit.   \n \nPeople  have  a  conception  of  household  food  security  that  goes  beyond  simply  having \nsufficient food  to feed household members. It also  includes access to safe drinking  water, \nsecure access to land forest and water resources, security for their livestock, the capacity to \nsend their children to school every day or on most days, and to provide a buffer against life \ncrises.  It  also  importantly  includes  adequate  material  and  symbolic  resources  to  fully \nparticipate in the religious and ritual activities in local communities and  meet other kinship \nobligations  such  as  providing  support  for  close  kindred  experiencing  material  hardship. \nWhere  exclusion  occurs  as  a  result  of  not  being  in  a  position  to  fully  participate  in  local \ncommunity  life  a  form  of  social  exclusion,  which  is  one  of  the  key  qualitative  indicators  of \npoverty,  often  occurs.  For  ethnic  minorities  unable  to  speak  the  national  language  of  the \nLao  PDR  this  is  also  a  form  of  social  exclusion  that  exacerbates  poverty.  Upward  of  only \n40% of Khmou are literate (male 60.8%, female 2.7%) and 26.5% of Hmong (male 45.7%, \nfemale 8.1%) compared to the Lao PDR rate of 72.9% (male 84.4%, female 65.1%). \n \nThe  Project  adopts  a  pro-poor  approach  and  the  components  have  been  designed  to \nbenefit people living in poverty. To ensure that the poor are among the beneficiaries, each \nsubproject will provide a range of agricultural extension packages based on the priorities of \nthe poor within each of the subproject communities, most of whom are likely to be involved \nin upland agricultures. Community-level organizers (CLO: female and male including where \nrelevant from ethnic minority backgrounds) will be appointed for the duration of subproject \nimplementation  to  facilitate  the  targeting  of  women  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  People \nliving  in  poverty  will  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  actively  participate  in  water  user \nassociations (WUAs), especially in subproject areas where rural water supply interventions \nare supported by the Project. This is likely to reduce the social distance between better-off \nhouseholds  and  households  living  in  poverty.  The  Project  will  also  provide  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  district  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office  (DAFSO)  and  district  Lao \nWomen's  Union  (DLWU)  to  work  more  closely  with  poor  households  on  designing \nappropriate extension packages that will directly benefit the poor. Sharpening of the poverty \nfocus  will  also  enable  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office  (PAFSO)  and \nDAFSO to more effectively target households living in poverty in order to meet the overall \npoverty reduction strategy of the Lao PDR. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well \nas  their  roles,  interests,  preferences,  and  aspirations.  The  primary  stakeholders  are  (i) households  in  the  subproject \nareas  that  will  benefit  directly  or  indirectly  from  project  interventions;  (ii) village  development  committees  and  other \norganizations  (formal  and  informal)  which  will  be  both  recipients  and  major  role  players  in  the  community  mobilization, \nconstruction  of  community-managed  irrigation  schemes,  and  agricultural  extension  and  resource  use  planning \ncomponents;  (iii) PAFSO  extension  workers  who  will  collaborate  with  WUAs  and  farmer  production  groups;  and \n(v) members of mass organizations, especially the district and village Lao Women\u2019s Union. The stakeholders\u2019 meetings \ndemonstrated  much  interest  in  and  support  for  the  Project  from  village  leaders,  local  communities  (including  most \nimportantly  women  and  ethnic  minority  groups),  and  members  of  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union.  A  socioeconomic  survey \nconducted during the technical assistance captured important social and gender profiles of the project area. A series of \nparticipatory  rural  appraisals  were  facilitated  to  determine  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  primary  stakeholders.  Other \ninputs from stakeholders have also been incorporated into the project design. \n \nSecondary  project  stakeholders  include  PAFSO  who  will  play  a  key  role  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  all  aspects  of \nproject  implementation.  Where  necessary,  PAFSO  will  provide  technical  backstopping  to  DAFSO.  PAFSO  in  all  five \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nprovinces  has  expressed  strong  support  for  the  Project  being  prepared  to  apply  lessons  learned  from  the  Community-\nManaged  Irrigation  Sector  Project  (CMIS).  National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES)  has  also \nexpressed strong support for  the Project and  will either supply or contract master trainers to provide training  in subject \nareas (such as sloping agricultural land technologies) where little or no expertise exists at either the district or provincial \nlevel.  Strong  support  has  also  been  expressed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  and  its  specialized \nagencies including the Department of Irrigation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring  the  feasibility  study  stage,  and  from  the  lessons  of  CMIS,  it  was  realized  that  substantial  time  and  effort  are \nrequired to  adopt a fully participatory  process in the design and development of  not  just  the irrigation schemes but the \nextension-related  activities  in  both  upland  and  lowland  areas  of  the  subproject  area.  Without  systemic  community \nmobilization  via  water  user  groups  that  involve  the  equal  membership  of  both  women  and  men,  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  responsibilities  and  ownership  of  irrigation  schemes  will  be  nonsustainable.  Equally,  agricultural \nextension and land use planning-based activities that are not designed in accordance with the full and active participation \nof primary stakeholders are unlikely to be very successful. The participation strategy is also premised on synergies being \nachieved  between  DAFSO  extension  workers,  including  female  extension  workers,  and  local  farmer  production  groups \nthat are more appropriate in the context of upland farming systems in the project area than has hitherto been possible. \nHowever,  the  participation  strategy  also  demands  of  stakeholder  groups,  especially  PAFSO,  a  better  understanding  of \nsocial  and  gender  issues  than  exists  at  present.  Iterative  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  participation  strategy  will \nrequire systematic attention to both quantitative indexes of participation (such as the frequency of attendance at meetings \nby  vulnerable  groups)  and  qualitative  indexes  of  participation  (such  as  to  what  extent  vulnerable  groups  were  able  to \nraise relevant issues and have them accepted by other group members). \n \nA  project-specific  community  participation  development  plan  has  been  prepared.  Essentially  it  starts  from  the  premise \nthat unless local communities are prepared to take ownership for project interventions, including participation of women \nand  men  stakeholders  (and  ethnic  minorities)  then  support  will  not  be  given  to  that  community.  However,  once  a \ncommunity agrees with the objectives of the subproject\u2014to be supported by a series of appropriate information sessions \nexplaining these objectives\u2014the Project will provide the enabling environment via the appointment of both a female and \nmale CLO (and where appropriate an ethnic minority CLO will also be appointed). The principal tasks of these CLOs will \nbe to work with their own local communities and be the linkage with the village committees, DAFSO, and DLWU. They \nwill receive appropriate training in social mobilization, including mobilization strategies for women and ethnic minorities, \nand  will  be  expected  to  provide  appropriate  training  to  beneficiaries  at  the  village  level.  Their  performance  will  be \nmonitored  by  both  their  own  local  community  and  an  external  monitoring  agency,  which  is  likely  to  be  the  DLWU. \nCommunity  mobilization  will  be  considered  successful  if  during  subproject  implementation  as  many  opportunities  as \npossible are afforded to local communities to play an active role in actual implementation. If local communities are able to \ncontribute to the survey and design of irrigation schemes, provide the appropriate inputs such as labor contributions for \nland  clearing,  contribute  to  the  development  and  maintenance  of  WUA,  and  demonstrate  ownership  by  taking \nresponsibility  for  O&M,  then  the  participatory  component  of  the  subproject  will  be  considered  successful.  The  same \ncaveats apply to the agricultural extension and land use planning component. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen\u2019s  interests  can  be  at  risk  if  they  (i) miss  out  on  technical  and  organizational  innovations  that  come  with  the \nProject; (ii) miss out on the benefits of the Project; and (iii) are left out of the decision-making processes,  which affects \ntheir  lives,  including  labor  and  livelihood  issues.  The  Project  will  entail  efforts  to  ensure  that  women  and  men  benefit \nequally from the Project, and that the Project\u2019s participatory processes are used as an experiential learning model from \nwhich lessons can be learned for the gender and development processes in the Lao PDR. The Project\u2019s gender strategy \naims to (i) mitigate the risk that women will be disadvantaged by project interventions (e.g., design of irrigation schemes \nor  irrigation  packages  are  gender  sensitive);  (ii) ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  community  dialogue  and  partnering \nactivities (e.g., meetings and farmer exchanges on an equal basis with men); (iii) ensure equal representation of women \n(at  least  50%  representation)  in  WUG;  (iv) promote  men  working  with  women  in  the  Project  (e.g.,  on-farm  crop \nproductivity improvement trials); (v) prioritize women\u2019s needs (e.g., DAFSO extension officers providing training in fields \nrequested  by  women  such  as  animal  health  interventions);  and  (vi) facilitate  gender  training  and  integration  programs \nwith the assistance of the DLWU (e.g., gender and development programs targeted at both men and women at the village \nlevel and PAFSO/DAFSO). \n \nThere are significant differences in women\u2019s social and economic status between the different ethnic groups. Unlike the \nHmong and Khmou, Lowland Lao society  has a matrifocal bias, in  which daughters generally inherit household assets, \nincluding land. This should mean that Lowland Lao women can make decisions about how land is going to be utilized or \nhow  water  is  going  to  be  managed.  However,  generally  speaking  women  at  the  village  level  are  not  equal  partners  in \n\n\fAppendix 4        35            \n\nmost public activities even if in public they have considerable influence over men. The situation is even more problematic \nfor other ethnic groups in the project area. However, the Project has the potential to have positive social and economic \nimpacts  on  women  by  (i) reducing  rice  deficits  and  thereby  contribute  to  household  food  security;  (ii) adding  value  to \nexisting  upland  agricultural  activities  via  appropriate  but  market  oriented  technology  options;  (iii) providing  women  with \nthe  opportunity  to  decide  what  knowledge  they  would  like  to  acquire  through  training;  and  (iv) providing  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  women  to  more  actively  and  effectively  participate  in  the  public  decision-making  processes  at  the \ncommunity level. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

The  subproject  selection  criteria  and  the \nparticipatory  design  processes  of  any  civil  work  alignments  will \nminimize resettlement impacts.  \n \nA \nframework  providing  compensation  and \nentitlement  policies  and  procedural  guidelines,  which  will  be \napplicable to all subprojects under the sector loan was prepared. \nA  short  resettlement  plan \nthe  resettlement  was \nprepared for two of the four  subprojects. Major principles  are to \n(i) avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and loss of assets \nand/or income as much as possible; (ii) carry out resettlement to \nimprove  or  at  least  restore  the  preproject  living  standards  of \naffected  people  (APs);  (iii) fully  inform  and  consult  closely  with \nAPs \nthe  resettlement  plans;  and  (v) provide \nadequate  compensation,  at  least  at  replacement  rates  to  all \npersons affected through loss of assets or income capabilities. \nA  socioeconomic  survey,  participatory  rapid  assessments, \nfeasibility  studies  of  the  four  sample  subprojects,  and  financial \nanalysis undertaken during the project processing confirmed the \nadequate  ability  and  willingness  of  beneficiaries  of  different \nincome  groups  to  pay  for  irrigation  water  service  fees.  Through \nthe \ncommunity  consultations  and  mobilization  activities, \naffordability and willingness to pay of beneficiaries will be further \ndiscussed and confirmed in detail prior to the detailed feasibility \nstudies of subprojects. \nCommunity contribution, which normally is in the form of labor, is \nexpected  for  irrigation  scheme  rehabilitation  works  and  O&M \ntasks.  Such  labor  contribution  will  be  planned  in  detail  together \nwith beneficiary farmers during community mobilization activities. \nParticipatory  design  procedure  of  subprojects  will  ensure  not  to \nlabor \noverburden  beneficiary \nrequirements  in  their  lifestyle,  and  scheduling  civil  works  in \naccordance with their labor seasonality. \nThe  three  major  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  area  are  the \nLowland  Lao  (includes  the  Tai  Sum,  Tai  Deng,  Phong,  Mene, \nPhouane,  and  Teng);  Khmou  (includes  the  Sene  Kai  and \nToume); and Hmong (includes Hmong Lay). Of these groups the \nKhmou (who are Mon-Khmer) are the indigenous peoples of the \narea  and  also  generally  the  most  disadvantaged.  The  Lowland \nLao  are  most  numerous  in  Houaphanh  (61.5%)  and  least \nnumerous in Luang Prabang (28.6%) and over 40% in the other \nprovinces.  The  Khmou  constitute  45.9%  of  the  population  in \nLuang  Prabang  but  only  10.2%  of  the  population  in  Xieng \nKhoung.  The  Hmong  constitute  53.7%  of  the  population  in \n\nfarmers  by  examining \n\ntheir \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nXaysomboun Special Region but only 15.2% in Luang Prabang. \nHowever, Lowland Lao are disproportionately represented in the \ndistricts  of  the  project  area  because  they  live  in  lowland  areas \nand  have  been  allocated  or  have  been  promised  allocation  of \nland that is suitable for irrigation.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  community-based  strategy  of  the  Project,  special \nmeasures  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  will \nbenefit  equally  from  project  interventions.  CLOs  from  ethnic \nminority  backgrounds  (including  women)  will  be  appointed  to \nsubproject areas where ethnic minorities are to be found. For the \nentry  point  extension  packages  poorer  groups  and  women \namong  the  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  accorded  top  priority. \nDAFSO will be required to work closely with ethnic minorities to \nbetter  understand  upland  farming  systems  and  then  provide \nappropriate  training  if  requested  by  these  ethnic  minorities. \nDAFSO will also need to improve its staffing profile by recruiting \nadditional  staff  from  ethnic  minority  backgrounds  or  training  its \nown  staff  in  how  to  be  more  farmer-centered  with  such \ncommunities.  Appropriate  language  training  will  be  provided  to \nethnic  minorities  who  cannot  speak  Lao,  including  if  necessary \nduring the day when they are working in the uplands rather than \nin  a  classroom.  Ethnic  minority  groups  will  also  be  afforded  the \nopportunity \nin  water  user \nto  become  active  participants \nassociations that also manage rural water supply systems. \n \nMany people from non-Lao ethnic backgrounds will benefit from \naspects  of  the  community  mobilization  component  (especially \nrural  drinking  water  supply  and  rural  access  roads)  and  will \ndefinitively  benefit  from  the  agricultural  extension  and  resource \nuse  planning  component  that  is  focused  on  upland  farming \nsystems. In some of the subproject areas\u2014Houaphanh being the \nobvious example\u2014some ethnic minority groups will benefit from \nthe  community-managed  irrigation  scheme  because  they  are \neligible to have some of the unallocated land allocated to them. \nThe Project requires of DAFSO (also PAFSO and NAFES) that it \nadopt  a  more  open-minded  approach  to  the  benefits  upland \nfarmers bring to agriculture in the Lao PDR rather than focusing \non the more negative aspects of shifting cultivation. This has the \npotential  to  empower  ethnic  minority  groups  in  ways  they  have \nnot  been  empowered  in  the  past.  Specifically  targeting  ethnic \nminority  groups  should  also  increase  the  income  of  these \ngroups,  even  if  more  indirectly  via  an  increase  in  food  security. \nThere  will  also  be  greater  opportunities  afforded  for  ethnic \nminority  groups  to  be  socially  included  rather  than  socially \nexcluded from other ethnic groups through language training and \nthe  opportunity  to  participate  in  community-based  organizations \nrather  than  clan  or  kin  based  groups.  This  has  the  potential  to \nempower  women  from  these  backgrounds,  especially  if  it  is \nassociated  with  language  training  because  it  effectively  means \nthey  do  not  need  to  communicate  with  other  ethnic  groups \nthrough their spouses or village leaders.  \nNo  other  vulnerabilities  are  expected  among  project \nbeneficiaries.  The  implementation  of  community  mobilization \nactivities \nthe  community  participation \ndevelopment  plan  would  facilitate  active  participation  of  all \nvillagers  and  equitable  distribution  of  project  benefits  even  if \nother vulnerable groups were identified in the project area. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nCMIS  =  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project;  DAFSO  =  district  agriculture  and  forestry  service  office;  DLWU  =  \ndistrict Lao Women's Union; DOI = Department of Irrigation;  MAF = Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; NAFES = National \nAgriculture and Forestry Extension Service; O&M = operation and maintenance; PAFSO = provincial agriculture and forestry \nservice office;  WUA = water user association; WUG = water user group. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nHOUAY LOR IRRIGATION SCHEME IN LUANG PRABANG PROVINCE \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Houay  Lor  Irrigation  scheme  (the  Subproject)  is  one  of  the  four  core  subprojects \nselected for feasibility level study as a basis for the preparation of the Lao Northern Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Loan (the Project) proposed for financing by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The subproject site is located in the Nam Bak district, approximately 8 kilometers \n(km)  east  of  Nam  Bak,  Luang  Prabang  province.  An  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nhas been prepared for the Project as a whole, and describes the environmental assessment and \nreview framework that will be applied to all subprojects (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n2. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Subproject  was  undertaken  during \nthe  project  preparation  work.  It  entailed  a  review  of  possible  design  options  and  proposed \nproject  area  and  its  environs,  field observations  within  and  around  the  proposed  scheme,  and \ninterviews with a variety of groups. At the time of the IEE, a proposed final design had yet to be \ndetermined but this, in fact, turned out to be a positive factor since it allowed the results of the \nIEE  to  be  taken  into  consideration  in  reviewing  and  formulating  design  and  development \noptions.  The  Project  as  a  whole  and  its  major  environmental  and  social  impacts  have  been \nwidely discussed between July 2002 and July 2003 during 36 focused village group discussions, \nand  the  socioeconomic  surveys  that  involved  113  villages  in  the  northern  provinces.  Further \nbeneficiary consultations will be carried out for the detailed survey and design of subprojects in \norder  to  minimize  any  social  and  environmental  adverse  impacts  and  to  design  schemes  that \nmeet beneficiaries' needs and expectations. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe Subproject seeks to develop the small-scale community-managed irrigation scheme \nwith  the  objective  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  poor  farming  communities  through  sustainable \nirrigation  development.  The  Subproject  is  in  line  with  government  agriculture  development \npolicies that focus, amongst others, on stable food production, mitigation of shifting cultivation, \nand  on  curbing  and  reversing  watershed  degradation.  It  is  recognized  that  small-scale, \ncommunity-managed irrigation agriculture is to play a key role in attaining these objectives.  \n \nThe  Houay  Lor  scheme  is  an  existing  farmers\u2019  managed  irrigation  scheme  with  a \n4. \ncommand area of 50 hectares (ha). The proposed subproject will entail the replacement of three \nexisting  small  wood  and  rock  diversion  weirs  by  three  permanent  run-of-the-river  weirs.  The \nweirs will be small in size. Left and right main canals will be constructed with a total length of \n6.0 km,  of  which  4 km  existing  canals  and  2 km  new  canals.  This  would  allow  a  wet-season \nextension of the irrigated area by 30 ha, from 50 to 80 ha. The dry-season irrigation potential will \nstay the same at 14 ha. The canals will be hand-dug, although some rock sections may require \nheavy  equipment.  The  canals  will  be  unlined,  and  provided  with  passageways  at  selected \nplaces. Canal heads, canal banks passing through unstable soil, as well as stream banks just \nbelow the weir will be reinforced with concrete and rip-rap to prevent scouring. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nAnnual  rainfall  in  Luang  Prabang  province  during  \u201cnormal\u201d  years  is  in  the  range  of \n1,350\u20131,400 millimeters per year (mm/y). The Houay Lor is a small permanent stream with an \nestimated  rainy  season  flow  of  1\u20132  cubic  meters  per  second  (m\u00b3/s),  and  an  estimated  dry-\n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nseason flow peak of 100 liters per second (l/s). The watershed area of the Houay Lor lies about \n3 km to the north (Pha Kioulom, 1,386 m mean sea level (MSL) and is approximately 26 square \nkilometers  (km\u00b2),  half  of  which  covered  with  secondary  forest,  the  remainder  used  for  upland \ncropping.  The  Houay  Lor  drains  into  the  Nam  Bak,  a  tributary  of  the  Nam  Ou  which  joins  the \nMekong river some 40 km to the southwest. In general the water quality in the river is good, with \nhigh  level  of  oxygen  and  low  level  of  nutrient  concentration.  This  is  a  favorable  condition  for \nirrigation development.  \n \nThe Houay Lor scheme lies within the zone formerly covered with dry evergreen forest \n6. \nbut very little of this formation survives in a natural state. By far the most common forest type in \nthe Luang Prabang province is the upper mixed deciduous forest that still covers parts of hilltops \nnearby the Houay Lor scheme. To date there are 46 provincial protected areas (PPAs) in Luang \nPrabang province, of which seven totaling 2,580 ha have been established in Nam Bak district. \nIn addition, Luang Prabang province has established 47 provincial protection forests (PPFs), of \nwhich seven totaling 1,822 ha are located within the Nam Bak district. None of these protected \nareas and protection forests is located in or near the proposed Houay Lor scheme area.  \n \n7. \nThe Houay Lor scheme in the Nam Bak district serves 229 families (1,056 persons) of \nthe ancient Nakhone village that was established several centuries ago. A second village, Vieng \nKham,  was  more  recently  established  (1986),  now  providing  living  space  to  104  families  (557 \npersons). Of the families in Nakhone village, 51 families are involved in upland agriculture, 57 in \nlowland  agriculture,  and  181  families  maintain  a  home  garden.  After  implementation  of  the \nHouay Lor scheme, the number of beneficiaries of irrigation upgrading will be 75 families (363 \npersons), which is 23% of the population of the two villages. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nAfter  implementation  of  the  Subproject,  two  environmental  benefits  are  expected  to \nemerge: (i) reduced amount of trees cut for weir repairs, and (ii) enhanced watershed protection \nthrough  poverty  reduction  and  effective  use  of  water  resources.  Nonetheless,  a  number  of \npotential  environmental  adverse  impacts  may  occur  during  the  preconstruction,  construction, \nand postconstruction periods. Using the checklist and matrix of environmental parameters and \nproposed  mitigation  measures  for  irrigation  sector  projects  from  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines,  the  Subproject  was  screened  for  potential  environmental  impacts.  The  results  are  \ndiscussed below. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Due to Project Location and Design \n\n \n9. \nThe Houay Lor is a small permanent river from which water will be diverted for irrigation. \nDrainage water and excess rainwater from the command area will return to the Houay Lor at the \ntail end of the command area. In the wet season, only a very small percentage of the river flow \nis diverted. In the dry season, a maximum of 50% of the river flow is diverted, and a part of this \nreturns to the river downstream. This is only a slight increase from present diversion by wood & \nrock weirs.  \n \n10. \nAs  noted  above,  although  there  are seven  PPAs  and  seven PPFs  in  Nam  Bak  district, \nnone  of  these  PPAs  and  PPFs  are  located  in  or  near  the  proposed  Houay  Lor  scheme  area. \nMoreover,  Houay  Lor  water  is  virtually  no  silt  load  and  is  slightly  alkaline  as  a  result  of  runoff \nfrom limestone rock slopes. However, the water is still suitable for irrigation purposes. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Associated with the Construction Phase \n\n \n11. \nSome  temporary  adverse  environmental  effects  could  occur  during  the  construction \nphase  without  proper  management.  These  would  include  soil  erosion,  improper  siting  of \nworkers\u2019  quarters  and  poor  waste  disposal,  loss  of  land,  and  aesthetic  deterioration  in  borrow \nareas. None of these impacts are expected to be individually particularly serious.  \n \n\nSoil  Erosion.  Since  no  major  earth-moving  works  are  required  under  the \nis  expected. \nSubproject,  no  erosion  risk  during \nNevertheless,  contracts  with  construction  companies  will \ninclude  clauses \npertaining  to  earthworks,  engineering  practice,  and  adequate  evacuation  of \ndrainage water. \n\nthe  construction  phase \n\nSiting of Workers\u2019 Quarters and Waste Control. Some outside workers will be \nused  for  construction  activities.  However,  since  the  subproject  works  will  be \nrelatively small scale, a large number of outside workers are not expected.  \n\nBorrow  Areas.  The  amounts  to  be  used  would  be  small.  Nonetheless  there \ncould  still  be  concerns  that  land  owners  or  users  may  not  be  adequately  and \nproperly compensated. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Resulting from Project Operations \n\n \n12. \nIt  is  expected  that  only  one  potential  problem  has  been  identified  for  the  project \noperation phase, which is the question of downstream water quality for human consumption due \nto the increased use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer. Irrigation development is expected to \nresult in an increase of farmers' incomes, and consequently, in increased use of pesticides and \nchemical fertilizer. \n \n13. \nCurrently, use of pesticides in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is still \nrelatively low, although in recent years the share of farmers using pesticides has increased from \n25%  to  56%.  There  are  two  factors  that  warrant  vigilance  on  future  use  of  these  compounds: \n(i) the Lao PDR is bordered by three pesticide-exporting countries\u2014People\u2019s Republic of China, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam\u2014and  manufacturing  companies  have  their  own  promotion  programs; \nand (ii) farmers in the Lao PDR have insufficient knowledge of safe handling and application of \npesticides,  which  may  lead  to  misuse.  However,  such  problems  could  be  mitigated  through \nstrengthened  management  mechanism  as  well  as  implementing  water  quality  monitoring.  To \nmitigate this potential impact farmers will be trained on (i) the selection, safe use, and handling \nof  pesticides,  (ii) integrated  pest  management  (IPM),  and  (iii) personal  health  care  using  as  a \nreference  the  updated  Regulation  on  Conservation  and  Use  of  Pesticides  in  Lao PDR  (2000), \nwhich lists prohibited or restricted use of chemical compounds.  \n \nE. \n \nTwo agencies are responsible for environmental management and monitoring in Luang \n14. \nPrabang province and will need to be associated with this subproject. The first is the provincial \noffice of science, technology and environment agency (STEA) and the second is the provincial \ndepartment  of  agriculture,  forestry  service  office  (PAFSO).  In  collaboration  with  the  provincial \noffice  of  STEA,  PAFSO  will  need  to  play  a  leading  role  in  monitoring  construction  activities  to \nensure  that  they  conform  to  the  mitigation  requirements  listed  in  the  matrix.  For  this  purpose, \ntraining  and  follow-up  guidance  will  be  provided  under  the  Project,  elaborating  the  proposed \nEMP for the Project.   \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Monitoring Program \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n15. \nTo implement the above-mentioned monitoring program, three water quality parameters \n(total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and alkalinity) will be tested once per year by \nthe laboratory of Department of Irrigation/Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at the end of the \nrainy season. The result would indicate possible changes in physical and chemical properties as \na  result  of  increased  sedimentation,  fertilizer  residues  entering  the  river  downstream  of  the \ncommand  areas  through  drainage  water;  sediment  load  could  also  indicate  changes  in  the \nwatershed, or the effects of bank scouring.  \n \n16. \nIt is estimated that total cost of $3,000 will be needed, of which $1,000 will be used to \nthe proposed water quality monitoring and the remaining will be used for training in safe use of \npesticides, IPM, and personal health care. Environmental monitoring results should be recorded \nand be submitted to PAFSO on a semiannual basis.  \n  \nF. \n \nThe Houay Lor scheme will, after rehabilitation, allow for wet-season irrigated cropping \n17. \non 80 ha. It will be based on the diversion of small volumes of water from the Houay Lor. It will \nbe  a  gravity  irrigation  scheme  that  returns  excess  rainwater  and  drainage  water  from  the \ncommand area back into the Houay Lor. After rehabilitation, the volume of diverted water in the \nwet season will amount to only a very small percentage of the river flow. In the dry season, a \nmaximum of 50% of the river flow is diverted, and a part of this returns to the river downstream. \nAccordingly, in particular with regard to the above screening process and analysis of potential \nenvironmental impacts, it is concluded that the proposed subproject is unlikely to result in any \ndirect significant adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n18. \nThe  identified  adverse  impacts  were  readily  addressed  through  proper  engineering \ndesign  and  incorporation  of  the  identified  mitigation  measures.  Adverse  impacts  relate  almost \nentirely to the construction phase, and particular attention will be paid to ensure that contractors \ncomply  with  good  engineering  practice  and  avoid  inconvenience  to  the  public  during \nconstruction.  Nonetheless,  in  order  to  ensure  correct  design  and  environmentally  sound \nconstruction and operation, a detailed EMP will be prepared and carried out during the design \nperiod.  \n \n19.  With regard to excessive fertilizer and pesticide use, given the fact that (i) only a small \narea of dry-season irrigated agriculture is expected, and (ii) the farmers within the project area \nwill be provided with supervision and training in dry-season cropping, including guidance in IPM, \nthe potential adverse impacts will be greatly minimized. \n \nG. \n \n20. \nThe  Houay  Lor  scheme  is  a  traditional  farmer-managed  irrigation  scheme  with  a  water \ndistribution  system  based  on  gravity,  and  return  flow  of  drainage  water  in  the  same  stream \n(Houay  Lor)  from  which  water  is  being  diverted  for  irrigation.  Some  positive  environmental \neffects  can  be  expected  as  a  result  of  the  subproject;  while,  with  proper  supervision  and \nmonitoring  during  the  construction  phase,  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be \nminor and temporary. Accordingly, the subproject could result, not only in raising incomes, but \nalso  in  enhanced  quality  of  life  of  residents  in  and  around  the  subproject  area,  and  improved \nwatershed protection and sustainability of the scheme. Since no serious adverse environmental \neffects are likely, a full environmental impact assessment is not considered necessary.  \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  Appendix 6  \n\n41 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\n1. \nProject Background. The Northern Community-Managed Irrigation Project (the Project) \nwill operate in the mountainous areas of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and will have four \ncomponents:  (i)  community  mobilization,  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building,  (iii)  community-\nmanaged irrigation investment, and (iv) agricultural extension and resource use planning. Of the \nfour components, the community-managed irrigation investment component will cover about 30 \nsubproject  sites  and  will  most  likely  have  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  effects  as  the \nproposed outputs include: (i) replacement of traditional weirs with new weirs; (ii) construction or \nmajor repairs to primary canals; (iii) construction of large or difficult structures within the system; \n(iv) advice on distribution and drainage arrangements; and (v) upgrading of about 30 kilometers \nof rural access roads. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  irrigation  schemes  to  be  developed  or  improved  by  the  Project  will  be \nsmall  with  areas  less  than  100  hectares  (ha)  and  an  estimated  average  area  of  50  to  60  ha. \nIrrigation water supplied from all schemes will be gravity fed from small diversion weirs.  \n\n3. \nObjective. A resettlement framework for this Project has been prepared to ensure that \nresettlement  screening,  planning,  and  management  procedures  are  established  and  will  be \napplied  to  all  subprojects  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n\n4. \nPreparation  of  Resettlement  Plans.  This  Project  will  ensure  that  during  project \nimplementation, resettlement will be avoided or minimized as much as possible. During project \nimplementation, the following steps will be followed: \n\n(ii) \n\n(i)  Screen  subprojects  with  possible  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  screening \ncriteria  need  to  consider  not  only  the  scale  (number  of  affected  persons\u2014APs)  but \nalso the degree (severe or marginal); \nIdentify  the  need  for  the  preparation  of  a  full  or  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)1  in \naccordance with the criteria set out in the ADB Handbook for Resettlement; and \n(iii)  Relevant provincial agriculture and forestry service offices (PAFSOs) will prepare each \nsubproject RP when required to be submitted to ADB for approval and to be disclosed \nto APs before the award of civil works contracts. \n\nLegal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements. This resettlement framework \n5. \nhas been built upon the laws of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the \nADB  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  draft  National  Resettlement  Policy.2 \nThe principles and objectives are to ensure that all APs will be compensated for their losses at \nreplacement  cost  and  provided  with  rehabilitation  measures  to  assist  them  to  improve,  or  at \nleast maintain, their preproject living standards and income-earning capacity. The cut-off date of \n\n                                                 \n1   A  full  RP  is  for  significant  resettlement  effects,  i.e.,  200  people  or  more  will  experience  major  impacts,  which \ninvolves  affected  people  being  physically  displaced  from  housing  and/or  more  than  10%  of  the  household\u2019s \nproductive  assets  (income  generating)  are  lost.  A  short  RP  is  for  not  insignificant  resettlement  effects,  which \ninvolve  displacement  of  fewer  than  200  people,  and  loss  of  less  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets  (income \ngenerating). \n\n2   A  draft  National  Resettlement  Policy  was  prepared  by  the  Lao  PDR  Government  in  1995  and  presented  by  the \nScience,  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  to  the  ADB  RETA  5935  Regional  Workshop  on  National \nResettlement  Policy  Enhancement  and  Capacity  Building  at  ADB  Headquarters  in  2002.  The  draft  policy  is  the \nbasis for a Ministerial Decree on Resettlement that is being prepared under the Environment and Social Program, \nLoan 1867-LAO, approved on 6 December 2001. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nType of Losses \n\nTemporarily Affected \nLand \n \n\nPermanently \nAffected Land, \nCrops, and Trees \n \n\nAffected Houses, \nPrivate or Business \nStructures \n\neligibility for entitlement is the date that the census is carried out. The local communities will be \ninformed  prior  to  the  start  of  the  said  activities.  Persons  identified  during  the  official  census, \nwhether  with  or  without  legal  title  or  rights  to  the  land,  are  eligible  for  compensation.  Persons \nwho  encroached  the  area  after  the  agreed  cut-off  date  will  not  be  entitled  to  compensation  or \nany other form of resettlement assistance (Table A6).  \n \n\nTable A6: Project Compensation Principles and Entitlements \n\nEntitlements \n\n\u2022  No compensation for land if returned to original user. However, the Project will \n\npay rent to APs during the temporary use of APs\u2019 land; \n\n\u2022  Cash  compensation  for  loss  of  crops  and  trees  at  market  prices  and \ncompensation  for  loss  of  net  income  from  subsequent  crops  that  cannot  be \nplanted for the duration of the lease. \n\n\u2022  Compensation  for  affected  land,  crops,  and  trees  at  market  value.  Lack  of \nformal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  will  not  prevent  APs  from  compensation \nand rehabilitation measures. \n\n\u2022  For  land  under  tenancy  or  sharecropping  arrangements,  the  amount  of \ncompensation  for  crops  and  trees  will  be  divided  between  the  landowner  and \nthe tenant/sharecropper/lessee according to the sharecropping arrangements.  \n\n\u2022  Cash  compensation  equivalent  to  replacement  cost  for  materials,  labor  and \nother  transaction  costs  without  deduction  for  depreciation  and/or  salvageable \nmaterials.  APs  will  be  provided  with  transport  and  transition  subsistence \nallowance and loss of income if applicable. \n\n\u2022  Tenants  renting  houses/structures  are  entitled  to  3  months\u2019  rent  at  prevailing \nmarket  rates  in  the  area.  Tenants  will  also  be  assisted  to  identify  alternative \naccommodation  and  provided  with \ntransition  subsistence \nallowance and loss of income if applicable. \n\ntransport  and \n\n\u2022  For  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  groups,  the  Project  will  assist  in \nfinding  employment,  including  project  work,  replacement  land  and  assist  in \nrebuilding their homes if traditional sources of community or family support are \ninsufficient;  provide  additional  necessary  assistance  in  cash  or  in  kind  (e.g., \nfood, labor) based on their identified needs and priorities; and provide suitably \nadvantageous site to vulnerable households whose livelihoods will be affected \n(e.g., small shops) in order to reestablish their businesses. \n\nAffected Community \nProperty Resources \n\n\u2022  Cash  compensation  for  restoration  of  affected  community  buildings  and \n\nstructures, infrastructure to original or better condition. \n\n\u2022  Cash  compensation  at  replacement  cost  or  income  restoration  measures  for \nincome loss, if any (e.g., irrigation, community forest, income from fishing in the \nsubcatchment watershed and fishponds).  \n\nSource: The Resettlement Framework. \n \nConsultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Redress.  The  selection  of  subprojects  will \n6. \ndepend primarily on consultation and community participation. For subprojects that may involve \nland  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  effects,  the  APs  and  communities  will  be  informed, \nconsulted  properly,  and  encouraged  to  participate  in  order  to  provide  proper  information  and \nallow  proper  planning.  APs  and  communities  will  include  those  who  have  customary  rights  to \nnatural  resources  in  the  project  subcatchment  areas  but  will  not  be  the  project  beneficiaries. \nSubproject  RPs  will  be  prepared  and  disclosed  prior  to  ADB  approval.  For  grievance  redress, \nthe Project will provide APs with opportunities to express their concerns or grievances orally or \n\n\f  Appendix 6  \n\n43 \n\nin writing. All attempts will be made by the Project to address such grievances pertaining to the \nProject  as  a  whole,  relating  to  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement  issues.  All \ncomplaints  or  grievances  will  be  documented  properly  and  time-bound  action  plans  will  be \nagreed  upon  between  the  Project  and  APs.  The  Project  will  properly  monitor  the  progress  of \nsuch grievances and ensure that all grievances are resolved on a timely manner. \n \n7. \nImplementation Arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) through \nthe office of national project director (ONPD) will be responsible for the overall RP activities of \nthe  concerned  PAFSO  and  provide  technical  assistance  if  necessary.  PAFSOs  and  district \nagriculture  and  forestry  service  offices  (DAFSOs)  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. PAFSO, headed by a provincial project manager, will designate full-time chief \nresettlement  officer  from  PAFSO  and  resettlement  officer/s  from  DAFSO  to  ensure  the  proper \nRP  preparation  and  implementation  of  RP  activities.  PAFSO  will  work  closely  with  APs, \nconcerned departments, NGOs, and supervision consultants. The project consultants will have \na community development specialist to assist and supervise all social and resettlement-related \nactivities.  \n \n8. \nProject  Schedule.  The  community-managed  irrigation  component  will  be  implemented \nfrom  the  second  year  of  project  implementation.  The  selection  of  about  30  subprojects  will  be \ncarried  out  in  phases  where  10  to  13  subprojects  will  be  implemented  each  year  after \nundertaking the consultation and community participation process, completion of detailed design \nand detailed measurement survey, and community discussions to finalize alignments. Civil work \ncontracts will not be awarded unless its RP has been approved by ADB. While compensation is \nrequired  prior  to  dispossession  of  APs\u2019  assets,  income  rehabilitation  measures,  if  any,  may \ncontinue and be completed even after civil works have begun.  \n \n9. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  MAF-\nONPD,  PAFSO,  DAFSO,  and  project  consultants.  Each  PAFSO  will  submit  to  ONPD  a \nconsolidated  report  on  all  DAFSO  activities  to  ONPD.  ONPD  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly \nprogress  reports.  An  independent  monitoring  experts  or  agency  will  be  commissioned  for \nannual, midterm, and end-term monitoring and evaluation of all subproject activities.  \n \nResettlement  Plan  Budget.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  included  in  the \n10. \noverall project budget. This will include costs for the preparation or revision of subproject RPs, \nsocial  surveys,  asset  inventory,  valuation  of  and  compensation  payments,  internal  and \nindependent monitoring, other administrative expenses, and contingencies. The subproject RPs \nwill  provide  breakdown  for  each  types  of  losses  with  corresponding  cost  estimates  reflecting \nreplacement  cost.  Detailed  schedule  and  procedures  related  to  the  flow  of  RP  funds  will  be \nincluded in the subproject RPs. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n\ni\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\nTable A7.1: Local/Foreign Taxes by Financier \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nItem \n\n \n \n\nAsian Development \nBank \n\nAmount \n\n% \n\n \n \n  Amount \n\nFarmers \n\n% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Government \n\n \n  Amount \n\n% \n\n \n  Amount \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n \n\n1.

The  major  means  to  attain  these  goals  include  the  development  of  small-\nscale  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  and  the  provision  of  agricultural  extension \nservices  to  both  irrigated  farms  and  to  upland  cultivators  in  the  target  communities. \nApproximately  30  subprojects  covering  roughly  1,900  irrigated  hectares  (ha)  in  11  districts \nlocated  in  Luang  Prabang,  Sayaboury,  Xieng  Khouang,  and  Houaphan  provinces  and \nXaisomboun Special Zone will be selected for the project financing according to the subproject \nselection criteria. \n \nB. \n \nFor  the  quantified  analysis,  benefits  and  costs  are  examined  based  on  \u201cwith\u201d  and \n2. \n\u201cwithout\u201d  scenarios  for  20-year  life  of  the  Project.  With  the  provision  of  extension  services  as \nwell  as  increased  and  more  reliable  irrigation  water  \u201cwith\u201d  the  Project,  it  is  expected  that \nimproved farmers\u2019 choices of crops and technologies will enable a more productive agriculture \nin  the  subproject  areas.  Quantifiable  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  are  comprised  largely  of \nincremental production of irrigated rice and higher-valued dry-season vegetable crops as well as \nimproved  maize  in  the  upland  areas  surrounding  each  community.  Some  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  cost  saving  is  also  expected  as  the  project  weirs  will  replace  wood  and \nstone  weirs,  for  which  O&M  costs  (in  timber  and  labor)  are  very  high.  As  available  timber \nbecomes  progressively  distant,  it  is  assumed  that  these  O&M  costs  would  increase  2%  per \nyear. \n \n\nMethodology \n\n1. \n\nPrice Assumptions \n\n3. \nFinancial prices used in the analysis were identified through a survey of the subproject \nareas and crosschecked with prices noted in a variety of secondary sources. Economic prices of \ntraded goods, such as rice, maize, and fertilizers, have been estimated at boarder parity based \non  World  Bank  commodity  price  projections.  The  investment  and  recurrent  costs  were \nsegregated into tradable, nontraded, and labor components, and converted into economic price \nusing financial process net of taxes, duties, and subsidies. The economic analysis is presented \nin  2002  constant  terms,  and  economic  cost  and  benefits  are  estimated  using  the  world  price \nnumeraire.  A  prevailing  exchange  rate  of  KN10,800  per  US  dollar  has  been  used  for  the \nanalysis.  For  nontraded  goods  and  services,  economic  prices  have  been  calculated  based  on \nlocal financial prices adjusted by a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and a shadow wage \nrate (SWR) factor of 0.8 are used for rural labor in the farm budgets in order to reflect average \nlevels of rural underemployment in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. \n \n\n2. \n\nFarm Model Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \nThe  average  yield  of  irrigated  rice  cultivation  during  the  wet  season  is  assumed  to \nincrease  from  2  tons  per  hectare  to  3  tons  per  hectare,  and  during  the  dry-season  double \ncropping of different combinations of corn and vegetables will be introduced gradually over the \n6 years of extension assistance.1 To allow time for adoption of improved agricultural techniques \n                                                 \n1  The  type  of  vegetables  to  be  produced  during  the  dry  season  will  vary  depending  on  the  demand  of  accessible \n\nmarkets. For the analysis, representative crops of cucumber, cabbage, and onion are utilized. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nand  the  clearing  of  uncultivated  land  required  for  irrigation  expansion,  incremental  production \nbenefits  will  be  gradually  realized  over  a  6-year  period  after  the  completion  of  irrigation \nrehabilitation works. As each subproject community presently cultivates a significant amount of \nupland  area  surrounding  irrigated  flat  lands,  the  upland  area  for  maize  cultivation  in  each \nsubproject  is  assumed  to  be  200  ha.  It  is  assumed  that  project  extension  services  for  upland \nagriculture will induce a gradual adoption of improved crop varieties up to 75% over 6 years. \n \nC. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Viability of Representative Farms \n\n \n5. \nIncremental net crop income has been calculated by examining the yields and inputs of \nrelevant  crops  in  the  subproject  areas  under  \u201cwithout\u201d  and  \u201cwith\u201d  project  conditions.  Annual \ncropped area (as a proportion of \u201cwith\u201d project-benefited area) is expected to increase by 74\u2013\n112%.  Incremental  production  (in  metric  tons),  on-farm  employment  (in  days),  and  net  crop \nrevenue  (in  both  financial  and  economic  terms)  as  a  result  of  project  investments  have  been \ncalculated  using  farmgate  prices.  Expected  generation  of  incremental  financial  income  per \nhectare in the four subprojects is highly positive, indicating that substantial disposable incomes \nof farmers can be induced in the project area (Table A12.1).  \n \nThe expected level of incremental financial revenue per hectare is more than adequate \n6. \nto cover the irrigation service fee (ISF). The ISF levels were estimated based on the future cash \nexpenditures required for (i) annual routine maintenance, and (ii) periodic maintenance in year \n15,  which  is  expected  to  be  5%  of  the  full  construction  cost.  The  annual  routine  maintenance \ncost  of  an  irrigation  system  has  been  calculated  at  $10  (or  135  kilograms  (kg)  of  paddy  as  a \ncash  equivalent)  per  ha  for  weir  maintenance  plus  labor  contribution  equivalent  of  3%  of  the \ncanal  construction  cost.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  estimated  ISF  required  to  finance  cash \nexpenditures for annual routine maintenance and the full costs of periodic maintenance is quite \naffordable for farmers: the ISF accounts for 9\u201320 % of estimated incremental financial revenues \nfor  households.  Thus,  irrigation  beneficiaries  should  find  it  worth  their  while  to  protect  their \nbenefits by performing (or paying for) the required future O&M costs. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Financial Viability of Representative Farms \n \n\nSubproject \n\n \n\nNam Ten \n\n \n\nNam Pa \n\n \n\nHouay Lor \n\n \n\nWith \nProject \n   113 \n   218 \n\nWithout \nProject \n31 \n27 \n\nWith \nProject \n90 \n    345 \n\nWithout \nProject \n12 \n29 \n\nWith \nProject \n80 \n     190 \n\nWithout \nProject \n40 \n35 \n\n  Houay Yang Noi \nWithout \nProject \n16 \n35 \n\nWith \nProject \n26 \n95 \n\n \n\n29 \n\nIrrigated area (ha) \nFinancial crop \nincome ($/ha) \nRequired annual \nroutine \nmaintenance \n(days/ha) \nRequired annual \nISF for routine and \nperiodic main-\ntenance ($/ha) \nISF/Incremental \nincome (%) \nha = hectare; ISF = irrigation service fee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n       9 \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n85 \n\n23 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n         9 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n12 \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Implications \n\n \n7. \nIncremental  operating  costs  for  the  Government  to  support  community  institutional \nbuilding, extension service development, and irrigation scheme rehabilitation under the Project \nfunding \nwould  have  relatively  minor  budgetary \nrequirement during project implementation would be less than 0.8% of the Government\u2019s annual \nbudget  for  the  agriculture  sector.  During  the  postproject  period,  the  aggregate  incremental \noperating costs of fieldworks required to fulfill the Government\u2019s commitment to sustain the use \nof irrigation facilities through community consultations, irrigation facility maintenance assistance, \nand agricultural extension activities account for about 1% of the existing budget of the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Forestry.2 \n \nD. \n\nimplications.  The  average  counterpart \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n8. \nEconomic  viability  of  the  four  subprojects  (Nam  Ten,  Nam  Pa,  Houay  Lor,  and  Houay \nYang  Noi)  was  examined  comparing  the  estimated  benefits  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d \nproject situations. Crop production budgets have been derived for each of the four subprojects \nbased on the expected improvements in cropping patterns and crop yields. Only the incremental \nagricultural employment portion is calculated as accrued employment benefits. The incremental \nvalue  of  production  has  been  combined  with  an  evaluation  of  investment  and  O&M  costs  to \ndevelop a cash flow over the subproject life, and economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and \nnet present values have been calculated (Table A12.2). The EIRRs range from 12% for Nam Pa \nto  19%  for  Houay  Yang  Noi.  The  majority  of  the  cropping  benefits  in  value  terms  arise  from \nincreased irrigated area, and the improvement of dry-season cultivation and upland agriculture, \nwhich implies that substantial economic incentives exist for farmers to diversify crop production \nin the project area, once they satisfy their subsistence requirements.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSample Economic Analysis \n\n \n9. \nQuantified  Benefits.  An  analysis  of  the  Nam  Ten  scheme  in  Phoun  district, \nXaisomboun  Special  Zone  is  presented  as  a  sample  analysis.3  The  population  of  1,754  (316 \nhouseholds)  has  land  in  the  subproject  area  (combining  irrigated  and  upland  areas).  This \nscheme currently irrigates 31 ha through the use of seven traditional stone and wooden weirs \nlocated  along  the  Nam  Ten.  No  dry-season  cropping  is  possible  with  these  structures.  The \nProject will replace these weirs with a more permanent concrete structure upstream of the old \nweirs.  Additional  land  will  be  cleared  and  prepared  for  cultivation,  bringing  the  total  irrigated \narea to 112.7 ha. Some dry-season irrigated cultivation of vegetables will be possible. Nam Ten \nis  fairly  well  connected  by  road  to  Vientiane  (140  km  away),  and  marketing  of  vegetables  is \nexpected  to  take  place  through  traders\u2019  visits  to  the  village,  periodic  roadside  markets,  and \ndistrict rural markets. The subproject is expected to increase rice production by 344 tons, maize \nby  210  tons,  and  to  produce  355  tons  of  representative  vegetables  (onion,  cucumber,  and \ncabbage).  Annual  incremental  farm  labor  on  the  irrigated  area  (plus  the  assumed  200  ha  of \nupland  maize  land)  is  expected  to  be  22,886  days.  For  the  average  0.99  ha  farm  incremental \nannual  paddy  production  per  household  has  been  calculated  to  be  1,088  kg,  when  the \nsubproject  is  fully  operational.  The  consequent  increase  in  annual  household  income  is \nestimated at about $251 on average. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The  incremental  operating  costs  during  the  postproject  period  include  staff  fieldwork  expenses,  O&M  costs  of \nequipment,  and  office  expenses  of  DAFSOs,  PAFSOs,  district  Lao  Women\u2019s  Unions,  district  communication, \ntransport, post and construction offices, and district health offices. \n\n3  Full models and analysis for all four subprojects are presented in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nNonquantified Benefits. Apart from crop benefits, various other project benefits that are \n10. \nhighly relevant to rural livelihood are expected to arise, including (i) improved status of nutrition \nand  welfare  of  the  population,  (ii)  secondary  employment  and  business  opportunities  in \nagricultural  production,  (iii)  better  access  to  water  from  newly  developed  domestic  water \nfacilities, and (iv) improved access to markets and educational and health facilities. Some other \nnonquantified  benefits  are  quite  important  from  social  and  environmental  development \nperspectives  as  well.  Community  mobilization  programs  will  help  the  local  populace  both \norganize  its  efforts  for  both  project  and  nonproject  activities  and  include  both  women  and \ndisadvantaged ethnic minorities in its decision making. The development of increased irrigated \nland  is  likely  to  decrease  village  dependence  on  upland  swidden  agriculture,  producing \nenvironmental benefits in forest preservation and decreased soil erosion. \n \nEconomic  Return.  The  Nam  Ten  subproject  appears  to  be  economically  viable:  the \n11. \nEIRR  is  estimated  to  be  15%  (net  present  value  =  $73,090,  discounted  at  12%),  which  was \nderived  based  on  the  incremental  economic  net  crop  revenue  of  $88,117  per  year  and  the \nirrigation  infrastructure\u2019s  construction  cost  of  $1,940  per  ha.  The  total  economic  investment \ncosts were $253,467. Subproject-specific community mobilization and extension costs include a \nper ha share of the community level organizer training, farmer training, extension demonstration \nmaterials, rural access road development, domestic water supply system development, and the \nfield operation costs of provincial agriculture and forestry service office, district agriculture and \nforestry service office, and district Lao Women\u2019s Union  staff.4 All costs including extension have \nbeen  assumed  conservatively  for  the  EIRR  calculation  to  occur  in  years  1\u20134,  while  actual \nproject implementation is likely to stretch extension services to as long as 6 years.  \n  \nSensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the \n12. \nderived  economic  return.  The  tested  scenarios  are  less  benefited  area,  less  dry-season \ncultivated  area,  dropped  crop  prices,  decreased  crop  yields,  lower  benefit  level,  higher \nconstruction  and  O&M  costs,  and  shorter  product  life.  Overall,  the  subproject  appears  to  be \nquite robust. It will take fairly significant changes in the risk variables to cause the EIRR to drop \nbelow the 12% cost of capital and the sensitivity of each of the risks is low. This assessment of \nrobustness is supported by an estimate that there is only a 13.5% probability of the EIRR falling \nbelow the 12% level.5  \n \n13. \nPoverty  Impact  Analysis.  The  estimated  distribution  of  project  benefits  reflects  the \ncurrent distribution of assets within the subproject community, as agricultural production benefits \nare likely to accrue almost entirely to the owners of the land. Based on the result of the social \nanalysis, it has been estimated that 215 poor households (68%) reside in the subproject area. \nAs the poor households cultivate 131 ha or 43% of the project area, they are expected to get a \nsimilar  proportion  of  incremental  net  crop  income.  The  poor  can  also  benefit  from  the \nincremental agricultural wage-labor opportunities, which will cover a part (50% is assumed here) \nof  the  increased  labor  needs  of  the  nonpoor  farms  in  the  subproject  area.  Overall,  when \ncombining crop production and labor income, the poor can attain approximately 50% of the full \nlocal financial benefits of the subproject. The average annual incremental increase in household \nincome among the poor is expected to be $184, and the average incremental increase in rice \nproduction on farms of the poor to be 537kg. The poverty impact ratio for the subproject is 0.85.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Only costs that are specific to the development of the subprojects are included. \n5  This  estimate  was  made  using  the  @Risk  program  in  which  ranges  were  set  for  each  independent  risk  variable \n(benefited  area,  dry  season  area,  crop  prices,  crop  yields,  and  construction  cost)  and  1,000  iterations  were \ngenerated. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nCosts \n\nBenefits \n\nTable A12.2: Northern Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project (constant 2002 dollars) \n\nItem \nService Area  \n      Irrigated area (ha) \n     Overall ha (Irrigated area plus 200 ha nominal upland) \n     Average landholding (ha) \n     Households with irrigated land \n     Households with benefited land \n     Population \n     Poor Households as percent of total HH \n \n\n \n\nNam Ten\n\n112.7\n312.7\n0.99\n114\n316\n1,754\n68%\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNam Pa \n\n \n\nHouay Lor \n\nHouay Yang Noi \n\n \n90\n \n290.0\n \n1.96\n \n46\n \n148\n926\n \n60%  \n\n80\n280.0\n0.99\n81\n285\n1,503\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n65%  \n\n25.5\n225.5\n0.99\n26\n341\n1,615\n73%\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFinancial \n\nEconomic  Financial \n\nEconomic \n\nFinancial \n\nEconomic \n\nFinancial  Economic \n\nIrrigation Construction Cost per ha ($)\nOver-all Cost (including mobilization & extension)\nO&M Fee Total/year ($) \nO&M Fee/year/irrigated ha ($) \nO&M Fee/year/irrigated HH ($) \nO&M Fee as percent of full irrigation construction cost                       1.9%             1.9%\n\n1,623\n301,247        253,467 \n          4,177             3,529 \n               37                  31 \n               37                  31 \n\n1,940\n\n4,756\n\n3,978\n504,630          423,884 \n        7,990               6,774 \n             89 \n                75 \n           174                  148 \n1.9%\n\n2,088\n\n1,756\n222,400         187,869 \n    2,530              2,135 \n         32                   27 \n         31                   26 \n1.5%\n\n1.5%\n\n      93,210           120,403 \nOverall Incremental Net Benefits Total/year ($) \n321                  415 \nOverall Incremental Net Benefits per ha/year ($)\n814\nOverall Incremental Net Benefits per HH/year ($)\n630 \n851 \nOverall incremental crop and wage income per HH/year                     251              291              815  \n\n        59,829           88,117 \n             282 \n279\n\n           191 \n             189 \n\n  43,333 \n       155 \n152 \n193 \n\n          69,025 \n247\n242 \n250 \n\nIrrigated Incremental Net Benefits Total/year ($)                             48,123           53,435         81,504              85,721 \nIrrigated Incremental Net Benefits per Irrigated ha/year ($)                 427               474              906                  952 \nIrrigated Incremental Net Benefits per Irrigated HH/year ($)                423               469           1,775               1,867 \nIrrigated Benefits as Multiple of Irrigation O&M fees                           11.5              15.1             10.2                  12.7 \n\n  31,627 \n       395 \n       391 \n      12.5 \n\n          34,344 \n                429 \n                425 \n                16.1 \n\nPoverty \nIncremental crop and wage income per poor household ($)                180              184               400                  315 \n23%\nPoor HH share of incremental local crop and wage income                50%               43%            31% \n11.61\nPIR (In economy, poor's net benefits / total net benefits)                                           0.85\n\n       108 \n37%\n\n                 115 \n30%\n               0.3\n\nReturns \n\nEIRR (Base) (%) \n\nENPV (Base) ($) \n\n15.1%\n\n   73,090 \n\n12.1%\n\n      2,956 \n\n16.5%\n\n   79,140 \n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present value; HH = household; O&M = operation and maintenance. \n\n1.9% \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2,810\n102,893\n\n2,353\n86,478 \n      1,445            1,223 \n           57                 48 \n           56                 47 \n2.0% \n \n \n\n2.0%\n\n    13,517          30,702 \n            136 \n           60 \n90 \n40 \n93 \n54 \n \n\n 5,323            6,425 \n            252 \n    209 \n  207               249 \n     3.7                5.3 \n \n\n \n      46                 72 \n57% \n            0.63 \n \n\n63%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5\n9\n\n \n \n\n      \n        \n\n \n\n18.8% \n\n52,504 \n \n\n\f \n\nSensitivity Analysisa \na.
