An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nand  the  environmental  review  procedure  for  screening  and \napproval of subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix P.  \n \nRecognizing  the  strong  need  for  reducing  poverty  through \nadvancement  of  women\u2019s  socioeconomic  conditions,  the  Project \nwill  facilitate  a  process  of  economic,  social,  legal,  and  political \nempowerment among poor rural women, including ethnic and low-\ncaste  women.  The  project  components  reflect  multisectoral \ninterventions  in  four  areas:  (i)  economic,  to  enhance  rural \nwomen\u2019s skills, opportunities, and control over productive assets; \n(ii) legal, to improve legal awareness of women\u2019s rights among all \nstakeholders, access to legal services for poor rural women, and \ngender  responsiveness  of  judicial  and  administrative  institutions; \n(iii) social, to enhance social processes at community level and to \nimprove  opportunities  for  women  to  pursue  both  personal  and \ncommunity  development, \ntime-saving  household \ntechnology  and  community  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  institutional,  to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  institutions  and  women\u2019s  representatives  to \npromote  gender  equality  and \ntheir  gender \nresponsiveness. The Project is in line with the 10th National Plan \nand the decentralization strategy of the Government, which seeks \nto address gender, ethnic, and caste-related disparities. \n \nThe  low  status  of  women  in  Nepal  can  be  traced  to  economic, \nlegal,  sociocultural  and  political/institutional  factors,  which  are \nis \ninterrelated  and  mutually \nexacerbated  by  caste-  and  ethnicity-based  discrimination,  as  the \ncaste  system  defines  access  to  resources  and  opportunities \nleaving women more disadvantaged than men at each level in the \ncaste  system.  Women  have  unequal  access  to  food,  education, \nand  health  care.  Despite  constitutional  guarantees  of  equal \ntreatment,  poor  rural  women  have  limited  opportunities  to  earn \nincomes, limited access to productive resources, and few effective \nlegal  rights.  Women  are  discriminated  against  and  are  further \ndisadvantaged  by  the  lack  of  awareness  of  their  legal  rights  and \nopportunities.  The  double  burden  of  both  productive  and \nreproductive roles leaves women not only cash but also time poor.\n\nreinforcing.  Women\u2019s  poverty \n\nincrease \n\nthrough \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nto \n\nDespite legislative mandates to include women in political parties \nand  in  local  bodies,  women  continue  to  be  poorly  represented  in \nthe government and civil service at all levels. Moreover, women\u2019s \nlow  self-esteem  inhibits  their  participation,  while  their  low  social \nstatus  leaves  them  vulnerable  to  abuse  within  their  households \nand communities. Given that the causes of poverty and low status \nof rural women are multiple and interrelated, a holistic approach is \nneeded \nimprove  women\u2019s  well-being.  A  cross-sectoral \napproach has the potential to fully address the multiple constraints \nand deprivations of poor rural women in Nepal.  \n \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  in  rural  Nepal  by \nrural  women  and  members  of  other \nempowering  poor \ndisadvantaged groups, such as ethnic and low-caste women. The \nobjective is to improve the socioeconomic conditions of poor rural \nwomen through a process of economic, social, legal, and political \nempowerment  by  (i)  strengthening  their  individual  capabilities  to \nimprove their access to and control over assets; (ii) building group \nsupport  for  individual  and  collective  action  to  influence  and  hold \ninstitutions  accountable;  and \nreforming  Government \ninstitutions  and  processes  to  become  gender-responsive  and \ninclude  previously  marginalized  women \ninto  development \nopportunities.  The  project  components  comprise  (i)  economic \nempowerment,  (ii)  legal  empowerment,  (iii)  social  empowerment, \nand  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management.  The \ncomponents  are  mutually  supporting  to  promote  a  virtuous  circle \nof socioeconomic improvement among poor rural women. \n \nThe  Project  area  (map)  covers  2  clusters  comprising  15  core \ndistricts\u20138  in  the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western  regions  and  7  in \nthe  Central  Region\u2013which  represent  the  most  disadvantaged \nareas of Nepal, and where gender discrimination is pervasive and \ndeep.  An  additional  12  districts  and  5  towns  are  included  in  the \nProject  to  provide  follow-up  institutional  strengthening  support  to \nwomen\u2019s groups formed under the Microcredit Project for Women \nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe estimated project cost is $15.5 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange of $1.3 million (8%) and local currency of $14.2 \nmillion equivalent (92%). \n \n\n(iii) \n\nItem \n\nADB \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n1.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.3 \n\n    Local      \nCurrency \n       8.7 \n       3.4 \n       2.1 \n     14.2 \n\nTotal \nCost \n10.0 \n  3.4 \n  2.1 \n15.5 \n\n \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n($ million)\n% \n\n64.5 \n21.9 \n13.6 \n  100.0% \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  proposed  financing  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  is \nequivalent to SDR6.636 million ($10 million). The loan will have a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest  rate  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as will be set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n\nfor  overall  management, \n\n \n(DWD)  will  be \nThe  Department  of  Women  Development \nresponsible \nimplementation,  and \ncoordination of activities to meet the overall goal and objectives of \nthe  Project. The  Director  General  of  DWD  will  assign  the  day-to-\nday  project  management  responsibility  to  the  central  project \nmanagement  team,  in  Kathmandu,  headed  by  a  director  from \nDWD (project manager). To deliver  project services effectively to \nthe 15 core districts, management of the Project will be supported \nand  institutionalized  by  delegating  responsibilities  to  the  women \ndevelopment  officers  and  women  development  office  (WDO)  at \ndistrict  level.  A  district  project  team  headed  by  the  women \ndevelopment  officers  will  be  established  within  the  WDO  in  each \ndistrict. The district project team will outsource implementation of \nthe  project  activities  to  different  service  providers  (SPs).  The \nProject will use demand-driven processes that enable the targeted \nwomen to determine their own strategies for economic and social \nempowerment,  after  strengthening  their  individual  capabilities. \nThrough  their  social  mobilization  techniques,  WDO  staff  will \nfacilitate these processes. \n \nDWD of the Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare  \n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works \ncontracts will be small and therefore procured on the basis of local \ncompetitive  bidding \nthe  Government\u2019s \nin  accordance  with \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts \nawarded to community groups will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Community Participation in Procurement Guidelines. Single \nprocurement  packages  by  community  groups  will  be  limited  to \n$10,000.    Supply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated \nto  cost  over  $500,000  or  more  are  not  expected,  but  if  such  a \ncontract is required it will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive bidding. Contracts costing less than the equivalent of \n$500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. \nDirect  purchase  procedures  will  apply  to  minor  items  valued  at \nless than $50,000. \n \n\n\fvi \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject \nBeneficiaries \n\nBenefits \n\nand \n\n \n\nin \n\nin \n\nto \n\ntheir  households \n\nreach  30,000  women \n\nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic \nto  ADB \nconsultants  and  SPs.  Consulting  services  will  support  project \nmanagement  and  technical  aspects  of  institutional  strengthening. \nThe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  will  be  used  to \nprocure  172  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(22 \ninternational and 150 domestic). The services of different SPs will \nbe required. To the extent possible, SPs, prequalified according to \ncriteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  will  be \ncontracted  on  the  basis  of  competitive  bidding  procedures.  In \ninstances  where  the  number  of  qualified  SPs  is  limited,  direct \nselection may be applied with the prior approval of ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  cover  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  remote \ncommunities  in  rural  Nepal,  benefiting  households  in  80  village \ndevelopment committees (VDCs) in 15 core districts. The project \nactivities  are  expected \nthe \nmicroenterprise  (ME)  program,  100,000  people  through  the  legal \ncomponent,  12,600  women  and \nthe \ncommunity-based  water  supply  system,  16,800  in  the  sanitation \nschemes, 38,500 for time-saving household devices, and 9,200 in \nrehabilitation  of  local  trails  and  bridges.  The  actual  number  of \nbeneficiaries will be considerably less than the sum of 207,100, as \nsome women will participate in more than one scheme or avail of \nmore  than  one  of  the  services  provided.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject  are  poor  rural  women,  including  those  from  historically \nexcluded  low  castes  or  ethnic  groups.  Given  the  nature  of  the \nProject,  readily  quantifiable  economic  benefits  accrue  from  the \neconomic  and  social  empowerment  components  while \nthe \nbenefits \ninstitutional \ncomponents  would  be  realized  at  the  end  or  after  the  project \nperiod.  The  estimated  returns  from  the  MEs  are  substantial  and \nwill  significantly  affect  the  financial  well-being  of  the  families  as \nwell  as  the  local  communities  in  terms  of  induced  demand  for \ngoods  and  services.  The  legal  changes  will  translate  into \ntheir \nincreased \nintegration  into  the  mainstream  of  society  in  the  long  term.  The \ntime-saving  household  devices  and  the  community-based  social \ninfrastructure  are  aimed  at  reducing  drudgery  and  time  spent  on \nhousehold chores, such as fetching water and collecting firewood, \nand  will  allow  women  to  allocate  more  time  to  social  and \neconomic  advancement.  The  Project  will  have  a  direct  and \nimmediate  effect  on  strengthening  the  DWD  and  building  the \ncapacity  of  DWD  field  staff  to  increase  their  outreach  to  poor \nwomen. In the medium and long term, the increased outreach and \nawareness-raising will promote entrepreneurship and employment \ngeneration among women, hence raising their income and  social \nstatus. \n \n\nlegal  empowerment  and \n\nincome-earning  capacity \n\nfor  women  and \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nvii\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  a  changing  political  and \ninstitutional  environment,  and  as  such  will  face  considerable \npolitical,  institutional,  social,  and  security  risks.  The  main  risk \nremains  the  armed  conflict  and  political  instability.  To  allow \nimplementation  to  proceed  despite  the  conflict,  the  following \nstrategic elements are central to the Project's design: (i) demand-\ndriven  approach  consistent  with  local  development  priorities;  (ii) \ntransparency in what the Project will deliver to local communities, \nespecially the poorest of the poor, and within what time frame; (iii) \n(iv) \naffirmative  action \nimplementation \n(v) \nimplementation  flexibility  in  terms  of  selection,  phasing,  and \nfully  participatory  and \narrangement  of  activities;  and \ntransparent  approach  in  planning,  decision  making,  budgeting, \nand  monitoring.  However,  an  increase  in  the  intensity  of  the \nconflict  or  the  continued  lack  of  locally  elected  officials  at  district \nlevel  will  weaken  the  participatory  decentralized  approach  and \nmay  adversely  affect \nthe  pace  and  success  of  project \nimplementation. \n\nlow  caste  and  ethnic  groups; \ninstitutions  and  people; \n\nfor \nthrough \n\nlocal \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\ni\n\nx\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Gender  Equality  and  Empowerment  of  Women  Project.  1  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nThe causes of poverty and marginalization of rural women are multiple, interrelated, and \n2. \ndeep-rooted.  Lessons  from  past  programs,  which  aimed  at  empowering  women  in  Nepal  and \nreducing  their  poverty  (Appendix  2),  show  that  no  single-focus  approach  can  be  effective. \nInstead, a holistic, phased, process-oriented approach is needed to systematically improve the \nwell-being of Nepal's poorest and most disadvantaged rural women.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nWhile  per  capita  income  grew  at  2.7%  during  the  1990s,  the  incidence  of  poverty  in \n3. \nNepal  remains  high.  Poverty  is  more  severe  in  rural  areas\u2013where  88%  of  the  population  live\u2013\nthan  in  urban  areas  and  affects  most  households.2  Nepal  has  made  considerable  strides  in \nimproving  education,  health,  and  other  social  services  during  the  last  decade,  but  the  level  of \nhuman  development  remains  among  the  lowest  in  the  world  and  below  that  of  most  other \ncountries  in  South  Asia.3  Women,  constrained  by  natural  and  social  barriers,  bear  a \ndisproportionate share of the poverty burden as shown by a gender-related development index \nof 119 out of 144 countries. Women have unequal access to food, education, and health care, \nand  suffer  from  long  working  hours  and  high  levels  of  social  exclusion  from  productive \nresources  and  community  activities.4  This  type  of  discrimination  against  women  and  girls  is \nmore severe in the terai and Midwestern and Far Western regions and creates a fertile ground \nfor trafficking (Supplementary Appendix A) and child labor, which are reportedly increasing.  \n \n4. \nPoverty is exacerbated by caste- and ethnicity-based discrimination. Nepalese society is \ncharacterized  by  complex  differences  in  ethnicity,  caste,  language,  and  religion  and  the  caste \nsystem  defines  access  to  resources  and  opportunities.  At  each  level  in  the  caste  system  or \nwithin an ethnic group, women are more disadvantaged than men. It is estimated that the entire \npopulation  of  dalit5  women  live  below  the  official  poverty  line.  Literacy  rate  is  on  average  7% \namong dalit women and life expectancy is 10\u201314 years lower than that for high caste women. \n \nGender-based  vulnerability  has  been  intensified  by  the  ongoing  conflict  between  the \n5. \nGovernment and the insurgents. Because rural economic activity has been curtailed, many men \nhave left to seek work elsewhere on a long-term basis, leaving women responsible for meeting \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

A  $537,000  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  NEP-3872,  was \napproved in May 2002. \n\n2  The head count index places 56% of the population in the mountains below the poverty line, 41% in the hills and \n42%  in  the  terai  (44%  in  rural  areas  as  a  whole),  whereas  in  the  urban  areas  23%  are  poor.  Also  the  human \ndevelopment index (HDI) disaggregated by region highlights the inequity of development across areas. \n\n3  UNDP. 2003. Human Development Report. New York and Oxford. HDI ranks Nepal 143 out of 175 countries, lower \n\nthan all Asian countries but Pakistan.   \n\n4 Despite significant gains in their socioeconomic status in the past 3 decades, during which female literacy increased \nfivefold, fertility dropped by half, and female life expectancy increased by 11 years, Nepalese women continue to \nhave a lower life expectancy than men, and their literacy and mean years of schooling are only half that of men. \nThe maternal mortality rate continues to be high and the child mortality rates are higher for girls than for boys. \n\n5  Dalit refers to the lowest caste (\u201cuntouchable\u201d) in the Hindu caste system (Supplementary Appendix B).   \n\n\f2 \n\nall the needs of the family in regions where there are fewer opportunities for their employment, \nvery  low  wage  rates,  and  few  services  delivered.  Over  time,  even  the  more  violent  armed \nconfrontations have increasingly involved women as guerrillas. Reports have placed 30-60% of \nthe  insurgents  as  women,  with  70%  of  these  women  from  ethnic  groups.  The  reason  for \nwomen\u2019s  increased  involvement  is  their  perception  that  conflict  is  the  only  means  to  change \ntheir  situation  in  society,  as  the  abolition  of  discrimination  by  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity  has \nbeen prominent in the insurgents' political agenda (Appendix 3). \n \nRural women suffer from lack of opportunities to earn income outside their households; \n6. \nthis lack further weakens their already low status. The strong gender division of labor requires \nthat  women  undertake  almost  all  domestic  duties,  including  time-consuming  tasks  of  firewood \nand water collection. Women spend an average of 11 hours a week more than men on work for \nthe household and girls from an early age are expected to assist their mothers in the household \ntasks. This chore prevents women from engaging in productive activities and from migrating to \nseek higher-return employment, and girls from attending school. Furthermore, women and girls \nput in more hours in agricultural production than men and boys.6 Women are generally engaged \nin semi-skilled and unskilled jobs closely related to their household tasks or local jobs. For the \nsame  work,  they  earn  about  70%  of  men\u2019s  wages  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Their \nparticipation  in  activities  with  higher  return  is  limited  by  (i)  lack  of  time,  (ii)  lack  of  access  to \neconomic  assets7  and  to  marketing  networks  and  technology,  (iii)  restricted  mobility  and  risk-\ntaking capacity, (iv) low education and lack of vocational training, and (v) social discrimination \non  the  part  of  the  employers.  The  concentration  of  women  in  nonpaying  or  low-skilled \nemployment  means  that  more  than  half  of  the  population  makes  a  fraction  of  its  potential \ncontribution to economic development at the household, community, and national levels.  \n \n7. \nWomen  in  Nepal  have  limited  legal  rights.  Although  the  1990  Constitution  guarantees \nequal  treatment  and  some  discriminatory  provisions  were  recently  modified  through  the  11th \namendment  to  the  Muluki  Ain  (Country  Code),  substantial  discrimination  continues  to  exist  in \nareas such as citizenship and related rights, property rights, and inheritance. In addition, there is \nlimited knowledge and awareness of relevant legislation, and legal institutions do not offer easy \nredress to women wanting to assert their rights. Partly because of this situation but also due to \nsocial  patterns  of  behavior  and  gender  insensitive  attitudes,  the  application  of  relevant \nlegislation and the enforcement of women\u2019s rights are limited. \n \n8. \nIn both the household and the public arena, women are also vulnerable to gender-based \nviolence,  such  as  verbal  and  sexual  harassment,  rape,  and  trafficking.  An  estimated  95%  of \nwomen and girls have firsthand knowledge of violence, 77% of which was from their own family \nmembers.8 The costs of gender-based violence to the potential for socioeconomic development \ncan  be  counted  not  only  in  impacts  on  health  and  eroded  self-confidence,  but  also  in  loss  of \nproductive  potential.  The  deteriorating  security  situation  and  insurgency  have  also  presented \nnew chances for assault on women. \n \n9. \nWomen\u2019s participation in the economic and political life is low, with a wide gap between \nurban  and  rural  areas.  Despite  the  contributions  women  make  to  family  livelihood,  they  have \nusually little say in household decision making. Differences in levels of awareness and ability to \n\n                                                 \n6 Between the ages of 10 and 14, 28% of girls versus 18% of boys are active in farm production.   \n7 For instance, discriminatory practices at microfinance institutions prevent lending to unmarried or widowed women, \n\nwomen who are illiterate or whose husbands have migrated. \n\n8  SAATHI  and  Asia  Foundation.  1997.

Women\u2019s  access  to  political \nand  administrative  decision-making  positions  has  been  minimal  due  to  the  lack  of  access  to \neducation and economic resources, social expectations of exclusive household responsibilities, \nand restricted mobility.9 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10.  Multiple  Forms  of  Discrimination.  The  low  status  of  rural  women  in  Nepal  can  be \ntraced to economic, legal, cultural, political, and institutional constraints, which are interrelated \nand mutually reinforcing. The analysis of rural women\u2019s problems suggests a need for a holistic \napproach  and  targeted  interventions  in  four  synergistic  areas:  (i)  economic,  to  enhance  rural \nwomen\u2019s skills and access to productive assets, both for self- and wage employment; (ii) legal, \nto improve legal awareness of women's rights, access to legal services and alternative dispute \nresolution  mechanisms,  and  gender  responsiveness  of  judicial  and  administrative  institutions; \n(iii)  social,  to  reduce  women\u2019s  time  burdens  through  improved  household  technology  and \ngender-sensitive  community  infrastructure,  and  to  promote  social  mobilization  for  collective \naction;  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening,  to  build  the  capacity  of  Government  agencies  and \nwomen\u2019s  representatives  to  promote  gender  equality  (GE).  The  project  has  been  designed  to \nfurther these interrelated objectives in a coordinated and sustainable manner. \n \n11. \nDrivers for  Change. Centuries-old cultural and behavioral norms must be overcome if \ndisadvantaged,  low-caste,  and  ethnic  women  are  to  make  their  full  contributions  to  Nepal's \nsocioeconomic  development.  It  would  be  immodest  to  suggest  that  any  single  project  can \nachieve  this  outcome.  Ultimately,  empowerment  will  be  driven  by  the  realization  among  all  of \nNepal's  people,  including  men,  that  (i)  women  and  disadvantaged  groups  can  and  will  make \nmuch  greater  contributions  to  the  socioeconomic  uplift  of  households,  communities,  and  the \nnation;  (ii)  all  household  and  community  members  will  benefit  from  this;  (iii)  legal  and  social \nsanctions  can  and  will  be  applied  effectively  to  protect  the  rights  of  women  and  the \ndisadvantaged; and, therefore, (iv) it is in the self-interest of all to support or at least accept the \nprocess  of  empowerment  of  women  (EOW).  The  Project  will  provide  appropriate  economic, \nlegal,  social  and  institutional  incentives  to  initiate  this  process  of  change  and  institutions,  e.g., \nthe  National  Women\u2019s  Commission  (NWC)  and  the  Gender  Stakeholders  Group  (GSG),  will \nfacilitate and motivate these changes beyond the Project\u2019s implementation. \n \n12. \nGovernment  Policies.  The  Government  is  cognizant  of  the  social  and  economic \ninequity of the Nepalese system. In the 10th National Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy, the \nGovernment  explicitly  recognizes  the  need  to  reduce  poverty  through  GE  and  EOW  and  to \nmainstream gender, ethnic and caste-related issues in the design of key programs.  To further \nstrengthen the institutional and legislative basis for gender and caste equality, the Government \nhas established the NWC and the National Dalit Commission (NDC) and is working on their Acts \nand  the  Cabinet  has  just  approved  the  \u2018Act  amending  some  acts  to  eliminate  discriminatory \nlegal provisions against women\u2019 - the GE Act \u2013 to be passed has ordinance. 10 The Government \nis  also  implementing  the  decentralization  strategy  of  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act  (LSGA, \n1999) to facilitate participation of the rural poor in decision making and to have delivery of public \n                                                 \n9  In  local  governments,  26  women  hold  executive  positions  compared  with  8,000  men;  only  30%  of  women \nrepresentatives at the ward level are fully literate, thus limiting their understanding of local government processes; \n25% never attend meetings, as they are not invited; 39% of those who attend only listen (UNDP estimates). \n\n10 This confirms Nepal\u2019s commitments at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 \nand to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), to promote gender equality (GE) and empowerment of women \n(EOW) (Supplementary Appendix D). The Project facilitated the passage by the Cabinet of the GE Act. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nservices  more  participatory,  gender-sensitive,  and  responsive  to  local  needs  (Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  Since  access  to  resources  will  be  determined  at  the  local  level,  meaningful \nparticipation  of  rural  women  is  vital  if  they  are  to  have  increased  control  over  resources  and \neffective roles in planning and monitoring local bodies functions. In view of this devolution, the \nmandate of the Department of Women Development (DWD) of the Ministry of Women, Children, \nand Social Welfare (MOWCSW) has changed, and in July 2003 the Women Development Office \n(WDO) became the focal agency at district level for gender and matters relating to minors, the \ndisabled,  the  aged,  and  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  (Supplementary  Appendix  F). \nThis  change  presents  an  important  opportunity  for  promoting  GE.  DWD  needs  therefore \nsubstantial capacity building to carry out this new mandate effectively, in view also of the recent \nregularization of the WDO staff, facilitated by the Project. \n \nADB\u2019s Strategy and Program. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program11 (CSP) for Nepal \n13. \nand  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  with  the  Government  recognize  that  the  stark \ngender  disparities  and  low  participation  of  women  in  decision  making  are  barriers  to  both \npoverty  reduction  and  sustainable  development.  The  CSP's  gender  strategy  follows  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  gender  and  development,12  and  recommends  that  gender  inequities  should  be \naddressed through strategic, broad-based, multifaceted solutions at the policy, institutional, and \nsector/program  and  project  levels.  Although  ADB  has  financed  one  project  that  specifically \ntargeted women, the Microcredit Project for Women13 (MCPW), its general approach has been \nto mainstream gender concerns in loan projects and to support legislative and policy changes to \nincrease opportunities for women within the civil service system.14 While gender mainstreaming \nis  an  important  tool  for  ensuring  that  women  participate  fully  in  ADB-funded  projects,  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  recognizes  that  women-focused  interventions  may  still  be  necessary  to  promote  GE  in \nareas  with  deeply  rooted  patterns  of  discrimination,  as  in  the  case  of  Nepal.  There  is  strong \nconsensus  on  this  among  development  actors  working  on  EOW  in  Nepal.  Appendix  4  is  the \nsummary of the external assistance for GE and EOW projects. \n \nThe  Conflict.  The  insurgency  has  created  security  risks  and  disrupted  rural  economic \n14. \nlife, but, at the same time, has enforced changes to land tenancy arrangements, lending interest \nrates,  workers\u2019  wages,  and  patron-client  relationships  to  benefit  the  disadvantaged.  Since  the \nproject objectives are consistent with gender, caste and ethnic equality, project implementation \ncan proceed despite the ongoing conflict. However, extensive consultation with the Government \nand  funding  agencies  with  ongoing  programs  suggests  that  the  Project  should  also  adhere  to \nthe following conditions: (i) it must take a demand-driven approach consistent with local needs; \n(ii) it must be clear on what it will deliver to communities and the poorest, and within what time \nframe;  (iii)  low-caste  and  ethnic  groups  must  receive  special  assistance;  (iv)  it  must  work \nthrough  local  institutions  and  people;  (v)  it  must  allow  for  flexible  implementation,  in  the \nselection and arrangements of activities; and (vi) it must be fully participatory and transparent in \nplanning, decision making, budgeting, and monitoring.15 All these strategic elements are central \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  1999.

Nonetheless,  an  increase  in  the  intensity  of  the  conflict  could  pose \nsignificant risks to the Project and, indeed, to all development programs. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective  \n\n15. \nThe goal of the Project is to reduce poverty in the project area by empowering poor rural \nwomen  and  members  of  other  disadvantaged  groups,  such  as  ethnic and  low-caste  women.16 \nThe  objective  is  to  improve  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  poor  rural  women  through  a \nprocess  of  economic,  social,  legal,  and  political  empowerment  by  (i)  strengthening  their \nindividual  capabilities  to  improve  their  access  to  and  control  over  assets,  (ii)  building  group \nsupport for individual and collective action to influence and hold institutions accountable, and (iii) \nreforming  Government  institutions  and  processes  to  become  gender-responsive  and  include \npreviously marginalized women in development opportunities. \n \nThe project area (map) covers two clusters for a total of 15 districts: 8 in the Midwestern \n16. \nand Far Western regions (the Western cluster) and 7 in the Central Region (the Central cluster). \nThese  districts  represent  the  poorest  and  most  disadvantaged  areas  of  Nepal,  where  gender \ndiscrimination is pervasive and deep.17 The Project provides follow-up institutional strengthening \nsupport  to  women\u2019s  savings  and  credit  groups  formed  under  the  MCPW  in  12  districts  and  5 \ntowns in the Midwestern, Central, and Eastern regions.18 \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  will  have \n\nfour  components  (i)  economic  empowerment,  (ii) \n\n17. \nlegal \nempowerment,  (iii)  social  empowerment,  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  project \nmanagement.  These  components  are  mutually  supportive  to  promote  a  virtuous  circle  of \nsocioeconomic  improvement  among  poor  rural  women.  Advancement  on  any  one  front \n(economic,  legal,  or  social)  will  increase  women\u2019s  capacities  to  advance  on  other  fronts,  by \nproviding  the  necessary  mix  for  women\u2019s  meaningful  empowerment.  The  Project  envisages  a \nset  of  activities,  the  selection  and  implementation  of  which  may  vary  due  to  the  process  and \ndemand-driven  approach  and  to  the  flexibility  to  introduce  changes  based  on  implementation \nexperience. Lessons learned have been incorporated in the design of the Project. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Empowerment  \n\n18. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  increase  income,  assets,  and  employment \nopportunities  for  poor  rural  women  through  improved  business  knowledge  and  entrepreneurial \nskills, and reliable access to needed financial resources, through the following activities: \n \n\na. \n\nPrograms for Promoting Income Generation \n\n19. \nGiven  the  different  socioeconomic  conditions  of  poor  rural  women,  the  Project  will \nsupport  different  packages  to  increase  women\u2019s  income:  for  the  most  vulnerable  women, \n\n                                                 \n16 Poor rural women in the text will always include ethnic and low-caste women. \n17  The  selection  criteria  for  these  districts  are  (i)  poverty  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  indicators  from  International \nCentre for Integrated Mountain Development and other indicators (such as gender empowerment measure; gender \ndevelopment  index;  %  of  dalit  population;  primary  school  girl  boy  ratio;  female  literacy)  from  the  Nepal  Human \nDevelopment Report, 1998. \n\n18 Project area in the text will refer only to the 15 core districts. See Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nimprovement  in  economic  security  rather  than  promotion  of  income-generation  will  be  the  first \nstep  to  smooth  consumption;  some  women  will  be  able  to  take  risks  in  developing \nmicroenterprises  (MEs),  while  others  are  wage  laborers.  To  provide  tangible  opportunities  for \nhouseholds\u2019 livelihood improvement, the Project will support activities to (i) increase women-led \nviable MEs, and (ii) improve opportunities and conditions for female wage laborers. \n \n20.  Women\u2019s  groups  (WGs)  will  express  their  preferences  in  selecting  potential  ME  and \nservice  providers  (SPs),19  and  will  assess  the  comparative  advantage,20  training,  and  credit \nneeds  for  promoting  MEs.  After  the  delivery  of  appropriate  technical  and  managerial  skills, \nbetter  access  to  credit,  marketing  advice,  technology  and  technical  backstopping  will  support \nthe development of sustainable women-led MEs. All districts have potential for a range of MEs \n(from  agriculture  and  livestock  based,  natural-resources  based,  small  food  processing, \ntraditional village craft, to trading activities21) that the WGs can successfully undertake.  \n \n21. \nTo  improve  opportunities  for  female  wage  laborers,  the  Project  will  build  specific  skills \nthat justify increasing women\u2019s salaries, based on rural and urban markets\u2019 demands, through \ntailored  training  programs  and  awareness  programs  for  women  who  desire  to  migrate  (legal \nprotection, \nImmune  Deficiency \nSyndrome, safe migration). The Project will supply manual tools and agricultural implements for \nfemale  agricultural  laborers.  In  addition,  when  labor  inputs  are  to  be  financed  by  the  Project, \npoor women and vulnerable groups will have priority employment (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n\nImmunodeficiency  Virus/Acquired \n\nregistration,  Human \n\nb. \n\nPrograms for Promoting Linkages to Microfinance  \n\nTo  be  able to  initiate  MEs,  WGs  need,  among others,  improved  access  to  reliable  and \n22. \naffordable  microfinance  (MF)  services.  In  the  Western  cluster,  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs) \nare unlikely to expand their operation in the near future; in the Central cluster, existing MFIs do \nnot  reach  poor  rural  women.  Hence,  formation  of  women-only  or  poor-only  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives (SCCs)  22 is the most suitable model to improve the target group\u2019s access to MF. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  formation  of  WGs  comprising  5-10  women,  improvement  of  their \nsavings23  and  lending  practices,  and  their  development  into  well-managed  and  member-\ncontrolled  SCCs.  Intralending  of  savings  among  group  members  will  be  promoted  to  fulfill  the \ngroup  members\u2019  immediate  cash  requirement  and  to  meet  their  credit  needs  for  productive, \nsocial,  or  consumption  purposes.  Depending  on  the  performance  of  the  groups,  a  strategy  to \ntransform them into savings and credit committees and then into cooperatives will be adopted, \nin addition to networking and linkages with district, regional, and national federations and apex \norganizations. Grant funds will be provided to match internally generated savings for the SCCs \nin the hills and mountains districts. \n \n23. \nUnder  the  MCPW  (Appendix  5),  around  6,500  WGs  and  82  women\u2019s  SCCs  were \nformed.  However,  these  SCCs  still  need  (i)  support  in  establishing  business  linkages  with \nwholesale MF providers, and (ii) follow-up training in various areas of institutional development. \n\n                                                 \n19  Service  providers  include  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  based  organizations,  and  private \n\nsector service providers. \n\n20  Identification  of  microenterprises  (MEs)  will  be  based  on  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  beneficiaries  interests,  raw \n\nmaterial availability, resource potential, and market demand for products and services. \n\n21 MEs will include very small scale enterprises and those without processing (Supplementary Appendix H). \n22  SCCs  are  legal  entities  registered  as  cooperatives  under  the  Cooperative  Act  of  1992.  The  licensed  SCCs  are \nthose  that  have  obtained  approval  from  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  to  extend  financial  services  to  members  and \nnonmembers. \n\n23 Savings are prerequisite for any woman to be a member of any group. Savings rates will be fixed by each group. \n\n\f7 \n\nThe  Project  will  therefore  support  activities  to  continue  building  the  institutional  and  service \ndelivery  capacity  of  these  SCCs  and  informal  WGs.  The  Project  will  finance  (i)  training  of  the \nSCC  members  in  various  areas  of  institutional  and  financial  product  development  to  ensure \nsustainability  and  to  strengthen  internal  control,  and  (ii)  the  development  of  business  linkages \nwith  wholesale  MF  providers  to  increase  the  scale  of  lending  and  meet  SCCs  members\u2019 \ndemand. The other set of activities is targeted to the WGs promoted under MCPW that are still \ninformal and includes (i) institutional assessment of the groups to identify capacity development \nprograms, and (ii) provision of technical support and training on institutional development. \n \n24. \nAfter  informing  the  communities  about  these  project  activities,  WDO  will  (i)  work  in \npartnership with local SPs to promote ME; (ii) engage the services of MFIs-NGOs or SPs to to \ntrain to SCCs and to establish links and ensure synergies between WGs and MF providers; (iii) \norganize exchange visits and linkages between groups and cooperatives; and (iv) link groups, \ncommittees, and SCCs with other development programs. \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal Empowerment  \n\n25. \nThis component will (i) increase the knowledge and awareness of poor rural women and \nother  stakeholders  about  their  legal  and  administrative  rights  and  obligations,  and  (ii)  build  an \nenabling environment to implement and enforce those rights (Supplementary Appendix L).  \n \n\na. \n\nLegal Awareness Raising and Education  \n\n26. \nA  prerequisite  for  legal  empowerment  is  increased  stakeholders\u2019  knowledge  of  their \nrespective  rights  and  obligations.  The  Project  will  help  prepare  and  implement  massive \nawareness  raising  campaign  in  the  project  area  on  issues  related  to  gender,  caste,  and \nethnicity, such as civil rights; safe migration and trafficking issues; domestic violence and sexual \noffenses;  polygamy  and  child  marriage;  birth,  citizenship,  and  marriage  certificates;  property, \ninheritance, and water rights; labor standards and debt bondage; and other relevant matters that \nmay be identified during project implementation. The campaign will include (i) the translation of \nrelevant legislation, regulations, and orders into local languages; (ii) media campaigns, including \nprint  media  and  popular  entertainment;  and  (iii)  community-based  training  of  both  men  and \nwomen.  The  campaign  will  pay  particular  attention  to  raising  awareness  with  girls  and  boys \n(through  child-friendly  means)  and  involving  government  officials  at  different  levels,  such  as \nvillage development committee (VDC) officers, and health or education officers. \n \n The  Project  will  support  the  law  faculty  of  the  Tribhuvan  University  in  preparing  a \n27. \nspecialized course and syllabus on rights of women and other vulnerable groups for inclusion in \nits Bachelor of Law Program. The Project will also help initiate the process with MOWCSC and \nMinistry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  for  including  women\u2019s  issues  in  the  curricula  of \nsecondary  schools  and  above.  DWD  will  engage  (i)  a  specialized  national  SP  with  relevant \nexperience to develop materials for, organize and implement the awareness campaign,24 and (ii) \na  domestic  consultant  to  help  Thribhuvan  University  prepare  the  course  and  syllabus  and \nMOES revise the curricula.  \n \n\n                                                 \n24 The materials will be developed in modules that will be selected and implemented in each district, depending on its \n\nparticular needs and problems, by the local partners of the national SP. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nb. \n\nCreating an Enabling Legal and Administrative Environment \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  cooperate  with  and  support  the  Judicial  Council  and  National  Judicial \nAcademy in training judges, prosecutors, and court personnel on the rights of women and other \nvulnerable groups, and gender-sensitive ways of dealing with female court users. District courts, \ndistrict  development  committees  (DDCs),  and  VDCs  will  be  provided  with  legal  reference \nmaterial, and copies of Supreme Court decisions - where feasible on-line. The Project will also \nhelp train police officers in the project area on women\u2019s rights and issues, and gender-sensitive \nways of dealing with female victims. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  help  in  establishing  alternative  dispute  resolution  (ADR)  mechanisms, \nand  train  mediators  and  paralegals.  The  ADR  will  include  both  out-of-court  household  and \ncommunity level ADR mechanisms. The mechanisms to be developed will build on existing local \nand  traditional  patterns  of  dispute  settlement,  while  at  the  same  time  recognizing  that  current \nsystems  may  be  biased  against  women  and  disadvantaged  groups.  DWD  will  engage  a \nspecialized national SP with experience in both household and community ADR to develop the \nprogram and train mediators and paralegals chosen from the community. \n \n30. \nTo strengthen the implementation of legal activities, the Project will support one female \nlawyer per district. She will (i) provide legal aid for access to the district court; (ii) provide legal \nadvice and support to the community mediators and paralegals; (iii) facilitate the interaction and \nthe  exchange  of  information  between  communities,  WGs,  local  chapters  of  the  Nepal  Bar \nAssociation, and the paralegal committees where they exist; (iv) assist eligible women to obtain \nbirth, citizenship, and marriage certificates, including through mobile government units at district \nlevel; and (v) give legal advice and assistance to WDO staff as required. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Empowerment  \n\nThis  component  will  (i)  enhance  social  processes  at  the  community  level,  and  (ii) \n31. \nimprove  household  technology  and  community  infrastructure,  so  as  to  increase  available  time \nand  give  more  opportunities  for  poor  rural  women  to  pursue  both  personal  and  community \ndevelopment.  Their  preparation  will  enable  them  to  participate  more  in  other  project  activities, \nand ultimately lead to comprehensive EOW. To achieve institutional and financial sustainability \nof the Project, the beneficiaries of this component will be required to (i) select the schemes, (ii) \nmake  up  to  35%  contribution  of  the  capital  costs  by  providing  local  materials  and  labor,25  and \n(iii) take full responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.  \n \n\na. \n\nEnhancing Social Processes at Community Level \n\n32. \nThe empowerment process begins at the individual level, but it is participation in group \nactivities  that  acts  as  a  catalyst  for  change.  The  Project  will  therefore  provide  (i)  community-\nbased  literacy  courses,  and  (ii)  group-based  activities  to  strengthen  group  cohesion.  The \ncombination of individual and group-based capacity building will contribute to the enhancement \nof  women\u2019s  personal  development,  strengthening  of  group  solidarity,  and  social  inclusion \nespecially of non-literate and semiliterate women. To address the abysmally low literacy rates, \nthe Project will take a cross-sectoral approach to literacy by integrating the learning into ongoing \ncommunity programs and in response to people\u2019s needs. To strengthen WGs\u2019 cohesion and to \nthe \nimproved  communication, \nbuild  community \n\nthe  Project  will  support \n\nthrough \n\nlinks \n\n                                                 \n25 For poor communities in remote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution will be reduced to 10% as set out in \n\nthe Government Policy on Community Contribution, 2002. \n\n\f9 \n\nestablishment of multipurpose women\u2019s centers, owned and run by WGs at VDC or community \nlevel  to  provide  women  an  adequate  venue  in  which  to  meet  for  social  activities  and  training \ncourses, and equipped with small libraries. WDO will (i) involve male community members and \nleaders to support the EOW process; (ii) organize exposure tours for women and men to other \nparts of the country where gender and caste restrictions are lesser; (iii) organize visits to district \nheadquarters  for  discussions  with  local  bodies  officials;  and  (iv)  support  institutionalizing \nwomen\u2019s federations. \n \nDWD  will  engage  a  national  SP  specializing  in  community  literacy  and  tailor-made \n33. \ncourses. The contracted SP will identify, train, and guide local NGOs, WDO, and DDC staff as \nappropriate and other potential multiplicators at the district level to develop and conduct literacy \ntraining  in  the  communities,  in  coordination  with  MOES,  its  nonformal  education  functional \nliteracy programs, and its district education officers.26 WDO staff and representatives from the \ncommunities  will  assist  in  field-testing  courses  and  teaching  material  to  ensure  they  are \nappropriate for the ethnic groups and occupational castes. \n \n\nb. \n\nThe Household Technology Fund \n\ninformation  on  existing  appropriate,  women-friendly, \n\n34. \nThe  Project  will  support  a  demand-driven  fund  to  provide  timesaving  household \ntechnologies,  such  as  improved  cooking  stoves,  storage  facilities,  biogas  plants,  and  other \ndevices.  The  Project  will  also  support  district  and  village  exhibitions,  fairs,  and  promotions  to \ndisseminate \ntimesaving  household \ntechnologies.  Local  promoters,  such  as  artisans  from  the  occupational  castes  and  technicians \nwill  be  trained.  They  will  then  train  interested  women  in  the  communities.  The  package  will \ninclude  (i)  promotion  of  technologies;  (ii)  assistance  in  the  installation;  and  (iii)  explanation  on \noptimal use, including O&M and hygiene education. \n \n\nc. \n\nThe Community Infrastructure Fund \n\n35. \nThe Project will support a demand-driven fund for community-based social infrastructure \nthat  will  serve  to  reduce  time  and  energy  expended  by  poor  and  disadvantaged  women  on \nmenial  tasks.  WDO  will  ensure  that  the  perceived  needs  of  poor  rural  women,  including  low \ncaste  and  ethnic  groups,  are  taken  into  account  at  the  planning  stage  and  will  engage  the \nservices of SPs to implement the subprojects with the involvement of men and women. The SPs \nwill  work  closely  with  the  selected  communities  during  the  development  phase  to  (i)  establish \nthe  relevant  user  groups  and  prepare  community  action  plans;  (ii)  provide  training  and  offer \noptions  to  the  user  groups;  (iii)  select  the  most  appropriate  technology  from  various  technical \noptions; and (iv) complete detailed designs, bill of quantities, and procurement. \n \n36. \nThe Project will finance on a cost-sharing basis (i) the construction and rehabilitation by \ncommunity groups of small water supply and sanitation schemes (WSSS);27 (ii) the construction \nof household latrines; (iii) the rehabilitation of foot and animal trails to improve access to existing \nrural  access  roads,  markets,  and  social  services;  and  (iv)  other  activities  requested  by  the \ncommunities  and  that  meet  the  selection  criteria.28  Communities  opting  for  WSSS  will  receive \nawareness  programs  in  hygiene,  health,  and  sanitation  practices.  Communities  opting  to \nimprove  trails  will  be  counseled  by  SPs  on  widening,  grading,  providing  cross-drainage  and \n                                                 \n26 Terms of reference (TOR) are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n27 The Project will follow the established criteria and processes of the ADB-funded Community-Based Water Supply \n\nand Sanitation Sector Project. For $24 million, Loan 2008, approved in September 2003.  \n\n28  To  avoid  duplication  and  overlapping,  the  Project  will  coordinate  with  the  ADB-funded  Decentralized  Rural \n\nInfrastructure and Livelihood Project, for $40 million, Loan 2092, approved in September 2004. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nmaintaining  the  improved  trail  to  ensure  its  sustainability.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the \nparticipating  communities\u2019  capacity  to  plan,  implement,  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  these \nfacilities. \n4. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Project Management  \n\nIn addition to facilitating the regularization of the WDO positions in all 75 districts,29 the \n37. \nProject will assist the DWD and WDO to (i) fully take on the new roles and responsibilities as \nfacilitators  for  women  and  GE  issues;  and  (ii)  continue  linking  autonomous  WGs,  formed \npreviously and under the Project, at national and district levels, through the following activities. \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Gender Mainstreaming Mechanisms of DWD/WDO \n\nThe Project will finance a full organizational audit of DWD, within MOWCSW and other \n38. \ninstitutions dealing with women\u2019s and gender issues,30 to ensure that their capabilities match the \nnew roles and responsibilities expected from the DWD and WDO at all levels. The findings from \nthis audit, carried out at the outset of the Project, will be used to set out a human resource and \nprofessional development plan for staff at all levels within  DWD to be  implemented during the \nProject.  The  audit  will  identify  training  packages  for  DWD  and  WDO  staff  on  various  issues, \nsuch  as  (i)  decentralized  planning  process;  (ii)  gender  budgeting;  (iii)  outsourcing  of  project \nactivities  and  selection  of  SPs;  and  (iv)  managing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  contracts.  The \nProject will support revision of the existing DWD working manuals. \n \n39. \nThe new mandate of DWD and WDO as facilitators and focal points for GE requires that \nthey play an advocacy role at various levels. WDO staff will be trained on (i) the structure and \npolicy-making  process  of  government,  (ii)  preparing  messages  and  information  about  priority \nissues  for  women  at  the  community  level  that  will  be  relevant  to  national  agencies,  and  (iii) \nidentifying  national  policies  and  implementation  gaps  to  be  addressed.  MOWCSW  staff  at  the \nnational  level  will  participate  in  training  with  WDO  staff  to  improve  coordination  between  the \nministry  and  the  department.  Collaboration  with  other  stakeholders  will  also  be  promoted \nthrough  the  establishment  of  the  GSG,  to  provide  a  common  platform  for  advocacy  and \nimplementation  activities.  Its  main  mandate  will  include  (i)  coordination  of  reforms  related  to \ndiscrimination  based  on  gender,  low  caste,  and  ethnic  minorities  particularly  as  it  affects \nwomen, (ii) coordination of GE programs supported by external funds and the Government, to \navoid  overlapping  and  repetitions;  (iii)  planning  complimentary  GE  programs;  and  (iv)  giving \nrecommendations on GE to the appropriate institutions.31 Members of the GSG, chaired by the \ndirector general of DWD, will include at least representatives of MOWCSW, DWD, NWC, NDC, \nthe Feminist Dalit Organization, the Donors\u2019 Gender Forum as well as civil society groups and \nNGOs with a strong focus on gender issues. \n \n40.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of outcomes from the planning cycle requires capacity \nbuilding at local and central levels. The Project will support training of WDO staff on qualitative \nand  process  monitoring  mechanisms  to  develop  indicators  for  different  types  of  programming. \nTo ensure that target groups benefit from the project activities as intended, a participatory and \ngender-sensitive  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  will  be  developed  in \ncooperation with WDO staff and at district and community levels. The Project will also support \nthe  strengthening  of  a  responsive  management  information  system  (MIS)  unit  within  DWD  to \nensure that outcomes can be tracked and trends identified for advocacy purposes. \n                                                 \n29  About  750  WDO  positions  have  been  made  permanent  and  reserved  for  women  only,  after  22  years  of  being \n\ntemporary positions with contracts renewable every 6 months. \n\n30 Such as Government institutions (NWC, Mainstreaming Gender Equality Program) and civil society organizations. \n31 Detailed TOR of the GSG will be developed by the institutional development expert. \n\n\f11 \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Gender Mainstreaming Mechanisms of Local Bodies \n\n41. \nDue  to  the  need  for  district  line  agencies  to  share  responsibility  with  WDO  staff  in \nimplementing  programs,  capacity  building  is  desirable  to  ensure  gender  sensitization  of  DDC \nstaff. The Project will support a gender audit of district line agencies to (i) determine the capacity \nbuilding  needed  to  improve  their  gender  responsiveness,  and  (ii)  identify  existing  gender \nmainstreaming mechanisms at community level to build on them. The Project will facilitate the \nestablishment  of  gender  subcommittees,  under  section  190  of  the  LSGA,  to  provide  technical \ninputs and review plans as they are incorporated into the district development plans (DDPs) and \npromote local cooperation on gender planning among stakeholders. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  intensive  training  and  other  needs-based  capacity  building \n42. \nactivities  for  (i)  government  officials as  well  as  elected  and nominated  representatives  in  local \nbodies  on  their  roles  and  duties  to  better  implement  existing  legislation  and  to  enhance  the  \naccountability of local bodies, with a specific focus on women\u2019s issues; (ii) nominees from WGs \nfemale  elected  and  nominated \nat  community \nrepresentatives32  on  the  decentralized  planning  process  and  cycle,  and  on  gender  budgeting \nand tracking; and (iii) elected and nominated women officials and other key stakeholders at the \nlocal  level,  on  policy  advocacy,  communication  skills,  and  government  functions.  The  training \nwill  support  the  institutional  development  of  WGs  and  the  gender  responsiveness  of  local \ninstitutions. Training different stakeholders on the same topics will increase cooperation. \n \n\nlevel  as  well  as  ward  and  VDC-level \n\nc. \n\nProject Management  \n\n43. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  motorcycles,  equipment,  and  part  of  the  incremental \nrecurrent  cost  of  the  central  and  district  project  management  teams.  At  the  district  level,  the \nProject  will  provide  a  basic  office  infrastructure  package  (office  renovation,  computer,  printer, \nbasic office furnishings, and training accessories) for the WDO offices in the core districts. The \nProject  will  also  provide  consulting  services  to  support  project  management  and  institutional \nstrengthening (organizational audit, M&E, and gender development), and to assist WDO and the \ncommunities to plan and implement project activities. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n44. \nProject  Beneficiaries.  The  project  beneficiaries  are  poor  rural  women  who  have  not \nbenefited  from  past  development  programs.  All  activities  focus  on  poor  ethnic  and  low-caste \ngroups  to  ensure  that  benefits  will  accrue  more  readily  to  these  disadvantaged  groups.  The \nProject  will  work  with  existing  groups  as  well  as  with  newly  formed  groups  to  allow  the \nhistorically excluded women to participate in the Project. Because of the geographical targeting \nand  the  selection  criteria  for  VDCs  and  communities  (Appendix  6),  the  Project  will \ndisproportionately benefit the poorest rural women. \n \n45. \nthe  causes  of \ndisempowerment  of  women  are  interwoven  to  such  a  degree  that  one  cannot  be  tackled  in \nisolation  from  the  others,  a  comprehensive  and  cross-sectoral  approach  is  crucial  if  gender \ndiscrimination  is  to  be  eliminated.  The  links  across  the  different  types  of  empowerment,  and \nthus  the  project  components  and  activities  aim  at  enforcing  and  supporting  each  other.  The \nProject  will  use  demand-driven  processes,  facilitated  by  WDO  staff  through  their  social \n\nCross-Sectoral,  Demand-Driven,  and  Process  Approach.  As \n\n                                                 \n32 If there is no female representative, the WGs can nominate a male ward/VDC representative to attend the training. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nmobilization techniques, to enable the targeted women to determine their own strategies for real \nand sustainable socioeconomic empowerment. \n \n46. \nSustainability of the Project. The Project supports the Government\u2019s decentralization \nstrategy  by  focusing  project  implementation  at  the  district  level  and  by  channeling  the  project \nfunds through the District Development Fund (DDF) mechanism. WDO will become an integral \npart  of  the  DDC  to  act  as  facilitators  for  GE  and  empowerment  of  WGs.  The  Project  avoids \ncreating  new  institutions,  making  maximum  use  of  the  existing  ones,  both  public  and  private. \nSPs  and  local  bodies  will  implement  activities  under  the  coordinated  guidance  of  DDCs  and \nWDO.  The  Project  will  assist  DWD  in  building  new  and  strengthening  existing  capacities  and \nskills  to  ensure  that  the  services  are  delivered  to  poor  rural  women.  The  Project  will  utilize \nsuccessful existing models of development and appropriate existing manuals and materials. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n47. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $15.5  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and \nprice  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charge  during  implementation.  The  foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $1.3 million (about 8% of the total cost). The local currency cost \nis  estimated  at  $14.2  million  equivalent  (about  92%  of  the  total  cost).  The  high  local  currency \ncosts  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  follow  from  the  nature  of  the  project  activities.  ADB \nfinancial support is justified given the high number of micro beneficiaries and the core poverty \nintervention character. The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Appendix 7 gives \nthe summary costs estimates.

The loan will fund $1.3 million (100%) \nof the foreign exchange cost and $8.7 million (61%) equivalent of the local currency cost. The \nGovernment will provide $3.4 million equivalent (21.9% of the project cost) and the beneficiary \nhouseholds and communities will contribute $2.1 million equivalent (13.6%, of the project cost) \nthrough their labor and cash inputs. ADB will cover a portion of the costs relating to civil works \nand materials, office equipment, consulting services, SPs contracts, and staff salaries, but will \nnot  finance  procurement  of  vehicles  (excluding  motorcycles),  rental  of  office  space,  and  taxes \nand duties. The Financial Controller General Office will disburse the funds to the DDCs through \nthe DDF as grant through budgetary allocation. \n\n\f13 \n\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32 \n49. \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  loan  will  carry  an  interest  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.

Given  DWD\u2019s  organizational  structure  and  staff  at  both  the  central  and  district  levels \n(Appendix  8)  and  its  experience  in  implementing  projects  through  its  own  WDO,  the  project \nmanagement  structures,  responsibilities,  and  activities  will  be  integrated  with  DWD\u2019s  regular \nadministrative set up, responsibilities and activities. The director general of DWD will serve as \nthe  project  director  and  will  assign  the  day-to-day  project  management  to  the  central  project \nmanagement  team  (CPMT).  The  CPMT,  located  in  Kathmandu,  will  be  headed  by  the  project \nmanager, a DWD director, and staffed by the following DWD staff: (i) two monitoring officers; (ii) \ntwo  training  officers;  (iii)  a  planning  officer;  (iv)  an  account  officer;  and  (v)  adequate  support \nstaff.33  All  staff,  including  the  project  manager,  will  be  assigned  to  the  Project  on  a  full-time \nbasis.  The  CPMT  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  consolidating  annual  project  work  plans  in \nconsultation with WDO staff; (ii) contracting out and supervising project activities to be carried \nout  at  the  central  level;  (iii)  monitoring  the  performance  of  district  project  teams  (DPTs);  (iv) \nmonitoring and evaluating project activities, outputs, and expected impacts; (v) ensuring project \nlinkages  with  programs  of  other  line  agencies  as  well  as  with  other  development  projects;  (vi) \nconsolidating  progress  reports  and  project  accounts,  in  consultation  with  relevant  WDO  staff \nand SPs; (vii) supervising consultants; and (viii) liaising with ADB. \n \n51. \nA  central  implementation  coordination  committee  (CICC)  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nMOWCSW will be established and will meet as necessary, but not less than twice a year, to (i) \noversee overall project implementation and review progress; (ii) provide overall policy guidance; \nand  (iii)  undertake  necessary  interministerial  and  interagency  coordination.  The  CICC  will \ncomprise the director general of DWD and representatives from National Planning Commission, \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Physical \nWork,  MOES,  Ministry  of  Law,  Justice  and  Parliamentary  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nIndigenous \nCooperatives,  NWC,  NDC, \nNationalities, Central Women and Children Service Centers, Nepal Bar Association, the special \nrapporteur  on  trafficking  in  the  Human  Rights  Commission,  representatives  from  the  NGO \nFederation  Nepal,  the  Feminist  Dalit  Organization,  the  Dalit  NGO  Federation,  two  women \n\nthe  National  Foundation \n\nfor  Development  of \n\n                                                 \n33 At least 50% of the CPMT staff should be women. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\ndevelopment officers (WDOfs) from each cluster, and others as deemed necessary. The project \nmanager will act as a member secretary. \n \n52. \nTo  deliver  project  services  effectively  to  15  districts,  project  management  will  be \ninstitutionalized by delegating responsibilities to the WDO in each district. A DPT, headed by the \nWDOf, will be established within WDO in each project district and will be staffed with at least the \nfollowing:  (i)  one  supervisor;  (ii)  one  accountant;  (iii)  six  women  development  assistants \n(WDAs);  (iv)  one  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer;  (v)  one  lawyer;  and  (vi)  adequate  support \nstaff.  To  improve  the  targeting  of  low-caste  women,  dalits  will  be  encouraged  to  apply  for  the \nWDA positions and will be given priority in selection. Each DPT will implement project activities \nin the respective districts, including (i) selecting VDCs and communities; (ii) mobilizing groups; \n(iii) selecting and contracting SPs for district activities; (iv) establishing links between the target \ngroups  on  the  one  hand  and  line  agencies  and  SPs  on  the  other  hand;  (v)  ensuring  that  all \nprograms  are  conducted  as  required;  (vi)  regularly  updating  villagers  of  ongoing  activities  and \ndisseminating information through appropriate means; (vii) preparing district level project plans, \nfor inclusion in the DDC programs, as well as annual budgets and disbursement requests based \non  approved  DDC  programs;  (viii)  supervising,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  all  district  activities, \nincluding  those  outsourced;  (ix)  maintaining  project  accounts  and  preparing  timely  financial \nreports  for  submission  to  CPMT  through  the  district  implementation  coordination  committee \n(DICC); and (x) preparing monthly progress reports for submission to CPMT through the DICC. \n \n53. \nA DICC chaired by the DDC head will be formed in each project district and will comprise \n(i)  the  local  development  officer;  (ii)  chair  of  the  VDC  association  (iii)  representatives  from \nrelevant  district  line  agencies;  (iv)  a  representative  from  the  NGO  federation;  (v)  a \nrepresentative  from  the  Dalit  Network;  and  (vi)  other  development  partners,  if  any,  working  in \nthe district. The WDOf will serve as member secretary. The DICC will meet as necessary, but \nnot  less  than  once  a  month,  to  (i)  facilitate  and  coordinate  technical  support  from  the  various \ndistrict line agencies; (ii) review district project plans prepared by the DPT and forward them to \nthe DDC for incorporation into DDC programs; (iii) review and confirm the selection by DPTs of \nVDCs  and  communities  for  project  interventions;  (iv)  review  and  endorse  the  selection  and \ncontracting  of  SPs  by  DPTs;  and  (v)  review  and  endorse  financial  and  progress  reports  to  be \nsubmitted by the DPTs to the CPMT. Appendix 9 is the implementation framework. \n \n54. \nThe  current  group  mobilization  process  of  WDO  consists  of  three  activities:  (i)  group \nformation;  (ii)  savings  mobilization;  (iii)  basic  training  on  group  development,  and  saving  and \ncredit management. Under the LSGA, planning decisions are made at the VDC level and then \nconsolidated into DDPs approved by DDC that will gradually become accountable to people for \ndelivering  programs.  WDO,  on  behalf  of  MOWCSW,  will  make  sure  that  the  subprojects \nrequested by mobilized WGs will be duly incorporated into the annual planning cycle and DDPs. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n55. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years: 2005-2009 (Appendix 10). Initial activities \nwill  include the  recruitment  of  consultants  for  the  CPMT  and  the  organizational  audit  of  DWD. \nNo activities can start until after the audit is finalized.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods,  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Project  will  be  procured \n56. \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil  works  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed \nand as such are unlikely to be of interest to foreign contractors. The capacity of local contractors \n\n\f15 \n\nto carry out these works is adequate. Consequently, all civil works contracts will be procured on \nthe  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Further,  contracts  awarded  to \ncommunity  groups  for  small  rural  infrastructure  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nin  Procurement  Guidelines.  Single  procurement  packages  by \nCommunity  Participation \ncommunity groups will be limited to $10,000. Contracts for equipment or materials estimated to \ncost over $500,000 are not expected, but if any is required, the contract will be awarded on the \nbasis  of  international  competitive  bidding,  and  those  costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping.  Direct  purchase  procedures \nwill be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $50,000. Appendix 11 gives the \nproposed contract packaging. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nA total of 172 person-months of consulting services (22 international and 150 domestic) \nwill  be  needed  (Appendix  12).  CPMT  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Quality  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be \nused.  Implementation  will  require  extensive  SPs\u2019  contracts.  The  SPs  will  be  contracted  (i)  at \nnational  level  by  the  CPMT  and  at  local  level  by  DPT,  and  (ii)  through  competitive  bidding \nprocedures for those that meet the criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB. 34 \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n58. \nThe  Government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  DWD  and  DWOs  through \nbudgetary  allocations.  To  ensure  timely  disbursement,  CPMT  will,  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness,  establish  an  imprest  account  in  the  name  of  the  Project  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank. \nPayments will be made to and from this account for eligible expenditure under the Project. Each \nDPT  of  the  15  Project  districts  will  open  one  subaccount  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to \nADB. They will be the operating accounts managed by the WDOf and the DPT accountant for \nthe eligible expenditure incurred by the 15 DPTs. Funds flowing from the imprest account to the \nsubaccounts will be routed through the DDFs, nonoperating accounts of the DDC. The accounts \nwill be opened subject to the appointment of qualified accounting staff and the establishment of \naccounting systems and internal control that are acceptable to ADB. The imprest account will be \nmanaged by CPMT and the subaccounts by the concerned DPT in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed \n6  months  of  estimated  expenditure,  or  10%  of  the  total  amount,  whichever  is  lesser.  ADB\u2019s \nstatement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and \nliquidate imprest accounts for any individual payment up to a ceiling of $50,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59. \nThe DPTs  will provide  the CPMT  with concise progress reports every  4 months during \neach  year  of  the  Project,  detailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  activities  against \nagreed-upon  targets  and  summarizing  the  PPMS  results.  CPMT  will  submit  (i)  consolidated \nprogress reports every 4 months, (ii) a comprehensive annual progress report, and (iii) a project \ncompletion report, within 3 months of Project completion,35 to relevant government departments \n\n                                                 \n34 When the number of qualified SPs is limited, direct selection may be applied with the prior approval of ADB. \n35  The  Project  completion  report  will  cover  implementation,  cost,  performance  management,  and  other  information \n\nrequested by ADB. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nand  ADB.    The  CPMT  and  DPTs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived,  expenditure  incurred  for  the  Project  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be \nestablished  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles. \nConsolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be compiled by CPMT and \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit  report  will \ninclude a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and its subaccounts and the \nSOE procedures. The audited accounts, audit reports, and associated financial statements will \nbe submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nIn  line  with  ADB  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  sanctions  are  mandatory.  For \nstatements  more  than  6  months  past  due  date,  imprest  funds  will  not  be  replenished;  for \nstatements more than 12 months past the due date, loan disbursement will be suspended. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n60. \nTo  ensure  that  the  target  groups  receive  the  intended  benefits,  a  participatory  and \ngender-sensitive PPMS, modeled on ADB system, will be used by CPMT and DPTs. At the start \nof the Project, the PPMS will be established in each district by the DPT. The output generated \nwill  form  a  part  of  the  MIS  established  by  CPMT.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  impact  rather  than \nactivity monitoring. The initial baseline survey, limited to key indicators, will also serve in part as \nthe screening required to facilitate the selection of target VDCs and must be conducted during \nthe initial 4 months of the Project.36 This set of key impact indicators will be (i) incorporated into \nthe  regular  monitoring  process  to  learn  from  the  field  and  to  adapt  the  project  strategy  to  the \nchanging  environment  and  to  the  evolving  needs  of  the  people,  (ii)  reassessed  at  midterm \nreview  (MTR)  and  at  project  completion  to  prepare  the  reports,  and  (iii)  used  to  compare  with \nother districts\u2019 indicators and programs and to measure Project contribution to the achievement \nof  the  10th  National  Plan  targets,  the  MDGs,  and  DDPs.  At  the  community  level,  participatory \ngender-disaggregated  M&E  will  be  introduced  to  support  the  participatory  approach.  Specific \nsurvey and analytical work will be required to monitor the social and institutional changes. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nDuring  the  initial  2  years  of  the  Project,  DWD  and  ADB  will  carry  out  joint  semiannual \n61. \nreviews to be supplemented by a comprehensive MTR during the first half of year 3. 37 The MTR \nwill  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (iii)  assess \nimplementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iv)  assess  the  performance  of  CPMT, \nDPT, SPs, and consultants; (v) assess effectiveness of community mobilization, considering not \nonly  number  of  groups  formed  but  their  progress  toward  meeting  their  objectives;  (vi)  assess \nprocurement  and  the  quality  of  community  civil  works;  (vii)  assess  the  effectiveness  of  project \nactivities;  (viii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  and  (ix)  establish  compliance \nwith loan covenants and any other issue agreed upon by DWD and ADB. At the latest, 1 month \n\n                                                 \n36 Project staff will receive training on the planning process, objectives, outputs and activities, different dimensions of \nempowerment,  and  field  training  on  how  to  conduct  a  baseline  survey  for  identification  of  most  relevant  process \nand impact indicators, and establishment of easy monitoring system connected to Poverty Reduction Strategy and \nMDG. The baseline survey will be based on a sampling covering the main diversity relevant to the project (socio-\neconomic  grouping,  gender,  ecological  zone,  ethnic  and  caste  system,  need  and  demand  assessment  by  group, \netc.). The baseline questionnaire will be tested first and reviewed to limit data errors and their misinterpretation. \n37 The initial reviews will also determine whether (i) all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in \nplace;  (ii)  the  selection  of  VDCs,  communities  and  target  groups  allows  the  project  activities  to  reach  poor  low-\ncaste  and  ethnic  groups;  (iii)  the  establishment  of  and  training  of  entrepreneur  groups  are  feasible;  (iv)  the  legal \nawareness  activities  are  effective;  and  (v)  the  conduct  and  the  outcome  of  the  capacity  building  and  training \nactivities are in line with Project objectives. \n\n\f17 \n\nbefore  to  MTR,  CPMT  will  submit  a  comprehensive  report  covering  the  above  issues  among \nothers identified during implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  cover  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  remote  communities  and \nhouseholds in 80 VDCs (30 in the terai and 50 in the hills and mountains) in 15 core districts. \nThe  project  activities  are  expected  to  target  poor  rural  women,  including  low-caste  and  ethnic \ngroups,  and  to  reach  30,000  women  in  the  ME  program,  100,000  people  through  the  legal \ncomponent, 12,600 women and their households in the community-based water supply, 16,800 \nin the sanitation schemes, 38,500 for time-saving household devices, and 9,200 in rehabilitation \nof local trails and bridges. At least 30% of women will be from dalits and ethnic groups.38 The \nactual  number  of  beneficiaries  will  be  considerably  less  than  the  sum  of  207,100  as  some \nwomen  will  participate  in  more  than  one  scheme.  Given  the  demand-driven  approach  for \nselecting  the  subprojects,  quantification  of  economic  benefits  involves  strong  assumptions  on \nthe proportion of funds used for the different activities; therefore a full benefit- cost analysis of \nthe  overall  project  was  considered  impractical  (Appendix  13).  Appendix  14  is  the  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n63. \nThe  economic  empowerment  component  will  provide  services  and  training  to  30,000 \nwomen, half of whom are envisaged to undertake ME on a continuous basis. About 60% of the \nMEs  are  assumed  to  be  from  the  terai  and  most  are  expected  to  be  agriculture-based.  The \nannual  income  generation  is  estimated  at  NRs2,900  per  annum  for  small-scale  commercial \nvegetable production to NRs110,000 per annum for operating a tea shop. The estimated returns \nfrom MEs are substantial and will have a significant effect on the well-being of the families as \nwell  as  the  communities.  The  immediate  beneficiaries  will  be  women  who  have  the  ability  to \ntake risks and their success is expected to have a demonstration effect, thus encouraging other \npoor women to establish MEs. \n \n64. \nThe legal empowerment component will indirectly support the registration for citizenship \nand  identity  cards,  which  are  requirements  for  education,  job,  and  credit  applications.  The \nlegislative  changes  and  their  enhanced  enforcement  will  (i)  put  in  place  property  rights  for \nwomen;l  (ii)  increase  women's  access  to  and  control  over  assets;  and  (iii)  increase  protection \nfrom  rape,  domestic  violence,  and  crime.  These  changes  will  translate  into  increased  income-\nearning capacity for women and their integration into the mainstream of society in the long term. \n \n65. \nIn the social empowerment component, the education programs will impact positively on \n(i)  women\u2019s  personal  development,  self-esteem,  and  awareness;  (ii)  women\u2019s  participation  in \ncommunity  activities;  (iii)  local  economies;  and  (iv)  family  health,  planning,  and  education. \nCommunity  participation  of  women  will  further  increase  their  confidence  and  strengthen  civil \nsociety by recognizing women\u2019s role. Exposure of men and women to other parts of the country \nwill help them understand the benefits of social change and contribute to a gradual change in \nattitude  toward  women\u2019s  roles.  The  time-saving  household  devices  and  the  community-based \nsocial  infrastructure  are  aimed  at  reducing  women\u2019s  time  spent  on  household  chores  and  will \nresult  in  more  participation  in  community  initiatives.  The  biogas  plants  and  improved  cooking \nstoves  are  estimated  to  save  women  150  minutes  each  day  because  of  shorter  time  spent  in \ncooking  and  in  collecting  firewood.  The  time  saved,  used  for  either  leisure  or  productive \n\n                                                 \n38 The Project will ensure that decisions do not impact adversely on indigenous people and minorities. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nactivities, is of economic value estimated at NRs2,750 per annum. Other benefits are reduction \nin  (i)  respiratory  and  eye  infection,  and  (ii)  degradation  of  forests  as  a  result  of  about  30% \nreduction in firewood requirements. The WSSSs provide economic benefit from time saved by \nwomen in fetching water, estimated at 60 minutes a day with an economic value of NRs1,100 \nper  annum.  Other  benefits  are  improvements  in  hygiene  and  health.  Rehabilitating  local  trails \nand bridges will improve access and market opportunities for local produce. Economic benefits \ngreatly depend on geographic location. \n \nThe  institutional  component  seeks  to  ensure  that  women's  concerns  are  heard.  The \n66. \nProject  will  have  an  immediate  effect  on  strengthening  the  DWD  and  WDO  to  increase  their \noutreach to poor women. In the medium and long term, the increased outreach will promote ME \nand  employment  generation  among  women,  and  raise  their  income  and  social  status.  The \nProject will (i) build the capacity of local community-based organizations to plan and implement \ncommunity projects, and (ii) promote good governance through effective participation of women. \n \n67. \nThe Project is unlikely to have any negative impact on the environment. All schemes will \n(i) be small scale and will neither adversely affect the natural resource base nor cause pollution, \nand (ii) undergo an environmental screening process. The Project will develop an environmental \nchecklist  for  planning,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines and Requirements. At all times during implementation, it will adhere to \nADB policies and guidelines on the environment (Supplementary Appendix O). Land acquisition \nand resettlement are not expected to take place. The Government will ensure that all facilities to \nbe constructed, extended, or upgraded under the Project will be located on land owned by the \nGovernment  and  no  resettlement  of  people,  including  squatters,  will  be  involved.  If  any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  will  be  required,  the  Government  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  develop  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  the \nframework in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n68. \nThe  return  to  armed  conflict  and  the  current  political  instability  are  serious  risks  in \nsuccessfully  implementing  the  Project.  However,  because  the  communities  consider  WDO \nactivities as highly pro-poor, WDO staff was able to continue to operate throughout the conflict. \nThis situation is expected to prevail during project implementation. In addition, specific conflict-\nsensitive features have been incorporated in the project design.  \n \nGeneral risks associated with implementing projects in Nepal include late start-up, weak \n69. \nimplementation capacity, and lack of locally elected officials at DDC and VDC level. These risks \nhave  been  substantially  reduced  through  the  project  design  that  strongly  emphasizes \norganizational  capacity  building,  recruitment  of  key  staff  as  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness, \nand  pre-project  hiring  of  consultants  to  facilitate  project  start-up.  In  addition,  the  CPMT  will \ndevelop \ntransparent  contractual  arrangements,  specifying  roles  and  responsibilities  of \ngovernment  institutions  and  SPs  before  the  Project  starts.  The  present  lack  of  locally  elected \nofficials  at  DDC  and  VDC  levels  weakens  the  participatory  decentralized  approach  and  may \nadversely affect project implementation until elections are held. \n \n70. \nA  specific  risk  associated  with  the  Project  is  that  the  executing  agency  may  not  have \nadequate  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  activities.  To  address  this  risk,  the  Project \nemphasizes  strengthening  of  DWD  and  WDO  through  staffing  with  relevant  expertise \naccompanied by staff orientation and training. The Project will also provide training and support \nto  the  DDCs  and  district-based  NGOs  to  build  their  capacity.  Gender  sensitization  will \n\n\f19 \n\nencourage support agencies to be more responsive to women\u2019s needs. Another specific risk is \nthat  MFIs  may  not  be  responsive  as  envisaged  in  providing  loans  to  the  target  groups.  The \nProject  seeks  to  reduce  this  risk  by  investing  in  strengthening  the  linkages  between  MFIs, \nNGOs, WGs, and SCCs; and in building the capacity of the WGs to establish a track record of \nsound management to make them attractive clients for MFIs. The final risk is that the targeted \npoor rural women are constrained in participating in project activities due to lack of time, energy, \nand  self-confidence.  To  address  this  problem,  the  Project  provides  support  for  activities  to \nreduce  time-consuming  tasks  for  women,  and  to  enhance  their  self-confidence  through  group \nmobilization.  The  demonstration  effect  of  women  leaders  participating  in  the  Project  will \nmotivate the poorest women. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n71. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  adopt  all  possible  measures  to  limit  the  transfer  of  project \nstaff; at least 50% of the CPMT staff will be women. \n\n(ii)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  created  a  legal \n\nposition and a M&E position for each WDO in the project area. \n\n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  WDO  in  the  project  area  will  have \nthe  following  staff  in  addition  to  the  WDOf:  (a)  one  supervisor,  (b)  one \naccountant, (c) six women development assistants, (d) one M&E officer, (e) one \nlawyer, and (f) adequate support staff. DWD will carry out appropriate measures \nto  encourage  women  from  the  dalit  community  to  apply  for  these  positions  and \nwill give priority to women from these communities in filling those positions. \n(iv)  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  additional  WDA  positions  recommended \n\nunder the organizational audit will have been filled. \n\n(v)  WDOfs will be provided with office space in the DDC building. \n(vi) \n\nApproved  budget  allocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all \ncounterpart  funding  required,  including  funds  for  the  daily  operational  expenses \nof DWD and WDO and funds to ensure the mobility of WDO staff. \n\n(vii)  Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the CPMT and DPTs will have undertaken \npoverty and social mapping to identify the VDCs and communities for assistance; \nthe  mapping  will  include:  (a)  women  of  landless  households,  (b)  poor  women \nheads of households, (c) former bonded laborers, (d) low-caste and dalit women, \nand  (e)  women  from  poor  ethnic  minorities.

On 29 January 2003, representatives of the Government of Nepal and the \nleaders of the Maoist insurgency announced a ceasefire to begin negotiations toward a peaceful \nresolution  of  the  conflict  in  Nepal.  Unfortunately,  on  27  August  2003  the  breakdown  of  the \ncease-fire was announced. While the intensity of insurgency remains higher in Midwestern and \nFar  Western  regions,  all  regions  are  now  affected  by  conflict  and  insecurity.  The  conflict  has \nclaimed  thousands  of  lives  over  the  past  7  years  and  has  affected  the  most  remote  and  least \ndeveloped  districts.  It  has  affected  agriculture  and  people\u2019s  livelihood;  separated  farm  owners \nfrom their lands; laid off workers from their jobs; and has disturbed the employment opportunity \nin  the  rural  areas,  thus  intensifying  exodus  of  villagers  to  the  cities  and  to  other  countries. \nWomen,  children,  and  the  aged  have  been  more  severely  affected  because  all  of  them  feel \ninsecure  and  defenseless  in  the  absence  of  the  men  in  the  family.  Women  have  also  been \nburdened by extra work and responsibility, lack of funds, and a continuous fear for their safety \nand  that  of  their  family.  The  number  of  women  employed  in  agriculture  decreased  during  the \nconflict  period,  with  a  most  negative  impact  on  employment  in  Far  Western,  Midwestern,  and \nCentral  regions.  While  the  situation  certainly  led  to  the  global  decrease  of  income,  some \ntenants,  home  keepers,  and  workers  took  advantage  of  the  situation  by  cultivating  land  and \nkeeping the full production. \n \nDisplaced  People.  About  402,100  persons  are  displaced  in  the  53  most  affected \n2. \ndistricts,  distressing  a  population  of  about  2,412  million.1  The  main  reasons  for  displacement \nare: death threats (43%), request for unreasonable donations (31%), looting and burning (5%), \nland taken by Maoists (3%). Other residents have moved because relatives are employed in the \nsecurity  force  or  police,  have  the  wrong  political  affiliation,  or  are  peace  activists.  Living \nconditions and food security have deteriorated, but not at an alarming stage due to the favorable \n2003  monsoon  and  2003/04  winter  cropping  conditions.  The  highest  percentage  of  displaced \nfarmers and agricultural workers is in Far Western and Midwestern regions. Several displaced \npeople have migrated to India and secondary towns to look for job opportunities, and additional \nremittances came from outside during the conflict period. These coping mechanisms may have \nin a way reduced the vulnerability of some but not all households. \n \nFor  the  displaced  population,  the  most  negative  socioeconomic  impacts  are  (i)  loss  of \n3. \ncapital  and  financial  assets  (livestock,  production,  house,  equipment,  agricultural  inputs  for \ncrops,  loan  for  seeds);  (ii)  increased  economic  poverty  and  increased  vulnerability;  and  (iii) \nincreased  need  for  rebuilding  assets.  Because  reconstructing  the  agriculture  sector  will  take \ntime, growth in agriculture may be slow, with weak employment opportunities and little economic \ndevelopment. Some displaced persons have sold their agricultural land (the income has partly \nfinanced  the  migration,  the  remaining  cash  is  certainly  not  sufficient  to  start  cropping)  and \nfarmer returnees may not be able to pursue previous farming systems. A negative social impact \nhas  been  the  decreased  (i)  formal  education  among  children,  and  (ii)  care  for  the  elderly  and \ninvalids. The displacement of people had a strong impact on the Nepalese agro-industry.2 \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The quantitative estimation of displaced people based on sample districts should be interpreted with cautioun, due \nto  high  variability  by  district  and  the  high  movement  pattern  of  the  population  in  dry  season  that  are  not  always \nrelated to conflict (migration is important in dry season). \n\n2  Respondents  owning  agro-industries  (76%  rice  mills  and  11%  oil  mills)  reported  that  25%  were  running  after \ndisplacement.  In  the  Eastern  Region,  97%  of  the  industries  have  closed.  In  the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western \nregions, 39% and 82% were operating respectively, but not at full capacity. In Mahottari, Okhladunga, Sarlahi,and \nSindhuli, 75% were in operation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \nAppendix 3 \n\nImpact on Women. Women\u2019s involvement in the Maoist army and political cadres has \n4. \ncaused  a  major  break  in  the  social  fabric  of  rural  areas.  One  study  reported  that  every  third \nguerrilla  is  a  woman  and  that  70%  of  women  guerrillas  are  from  among  indigenous  ethnic \ncommunities.3  Over  time,  even  the  more  violent  armed  confrontations  increasingly  involved \nwomen as active participants, with reports of 30%\u201360% of the Maoist cadres and soldiers being \nwomen.4  Anecdotal  evidence  collected  by  Nepali  media  through  interviews  in  the  affected \ncommunities  explains  women\u2019s  increased  involvement  as  their  desperate  perception  that \nconflict is the only apparent means to change their situation in society. Self-esteem, confidence, \nand modern life are being sought through the Maoist movement.5 \n \n5. \nWomen\u2019s household and farm-related work burden has increased dramatically because \nmany male members have left the villages (either they are migrated or displaced). Women must \nnow  deal  with  both  security  forces  and  Maoists.  Brahmin  and  Chhetri  women  who  were \ntraditionally forbidden to plow fields or repair the roofs of houses are now taking on these tasks, \nboth  out  of  necessity  and  because  of  the  new  egalitarian  value  system  introduced  by  the \nMaoists. Other practical changes for women who are not involved directly in the conflict include \n(i) considerable decrease in polygamy;6 (ii) decrease in domestic violence with threats to report \nor  actually  reporting  abusive  husbands  to  the Maoists  so as  to  receive  justice;  (iii)  increase  in \ndivorce  cases,  where  there  is  no  consensus  between  husband  and  wife  in  marriage;7  (iv) \nbanning of uncontrolled sale and public abuse of alcohol; and (v) decrease in gambling. It is too \nearly to say to what extent the positive changes are sustainable because they have taken place \ndue to Maoist action or threat of action. Only through continuous reinforcement of these positive \npractices by local people will they become sustainable social norms and values. \n \nImpact  on  Dalits.  There  are  no  data  on  the  actual  proportion  of  Maoist  cadres  by \n6. \nethnicity and caste. The Maoists have initiated a Dalit Liberation Front to encourage the dalits in \nthe movement to assist in eliminating caste-based discrimination and improving the provision of \nservices and opportunities for dalits. Dalits who have joined the Maoists are treated equally in \nnon-dalit cadre. They are not denied entry to houses or temples, have access to water sources, \ndo not have to wash their own dishes, and are addressed respectfully. Untouchability appears to \nhave  decreased  in  public  places  across  the  Maoist-controlled  districts.8  Some  villages  have \nbeen  declared  to  be  caste-free  villages.  It  is  estimated  that  more  dalit  women  than  men  are \ninvolved with the Maoists. Other practical changes for dalits include a decrease in the practice \n\n                                                 \n3  Gautam,  Banskota,  Manchanda.  2001.    Women,  War  and  Peace  in  South  Asia:  Beyond  Victimhood  to  Agency. \n\nDelhi. \n\n4  Center  for  Economic  and  Social  Development.  2003.  Kathmandu.  As  per  the  Conflict  Prevention  Initiative  of  the \nHarvard  Program  on  Humanitarian  Policy  and  Conflict  Research  done  in  2001,  women  constitute  a  third  of  the \nMaoist movement in some of the most affected districts. \n\n5  A  young  woman  Maoist  leader  from  Ramechhap  said,  \u201cMaoists  are  continuously  making  efforts  for  equal \nrepresentation of women at all levels.\u201d  She feels that women have space for this hard struggle within the party and \nthat the contribution  of  women to the liberation struggle is  much higher  than that of their male counterparts. She \nexplained  that,  as  women,  they  face  additional  difficulties  compared  with  their  male  counterparts:  when  they  fall \ninto the hands of the \u201cenemy,\u201d women go through extra suffering \u2013 \u201crape before bullet.\u201d Without the support of the \nwomen looking after the home and family, no male member could join the rebels, she added.  Women who remain \nat home are linked to the war through their daughters, sisters, brothers, sons, and husbands who have joined the \nMaoists. \n\n6 There have been a number of cases in base and buffer areas in which polygamous men have been punished by the \n\nPeople\u2019s Court, and their land and property returned to their neglected wives. \n\n7 Unlike in indigenous ethnic groups, Hindu high caste society strictly prohibits a wife\u2019s separation from her husband. \nThe team heard of several cases where the Maoists have assisted unhappy women to divorce their husbands.   \n8 A dalit Maoist said that it had been very hard to change the attitude of elders, from both dalit and non-dalit groups, \nregarding the practice of untouchability and that even dalit youth are hesitant to break with it for fear of retaliation \nby higher castes. \n\n\f \nAppendix 3\n\n31 \n\nof  denying  dalit  children  access  to  schools  and  in  the  use  of  abusive  and  discriminatory \nlanguage against dalits. Despite these positive changes for those who have joined Maoists and \nthose who live in Maoist-controlled areas, however, most non-Maoist high caste people remain \nextremely resistant to the breakdown of the caste system, particularly the idea of untouchability. \n \n7. \nImpact  on  Ethnic  Groups.  The  Maoists  incorporated  indigenous  ethnic  people\u2019s \nconcerns  into  their  political  agenda in  2000  by  opening  an  Ethnic  Department  at  central  level. \nHowever, it is reported that indigenous peoples who joined the insurgency have not been able \nto  assume  higher  leadership  roles  within  the  party,  nor  have  there  been  any  visible  positive \nchanges  in  the  livelihoods  of  the  indigenous  population.  In  fact,  indigenous  Tibeto-Burman \npopulations  are  reported  to  have  been  among  those  most  badly  affected  by  the  Maoist \ninsurgency in Nepal. \n \n8. \nActions  taken  by  the  Maoist  in  favor  of  indigenous  people  include  (i)  rejecting  and \nchallenging  various  high  caste  Hindu  symbols  and  practices,  which  were  adopted  by  groups \naspiring  to  upward  mobility  as  signs  of  both  high  status  and  modernity;  (ii)  promoting  and \nreviving  indigenous  people\u2019s  culture,  language,  and  traditions  at  the  local  level;9  (iii) \nencouraging various ethnic groups to raise issues of compensation (for land, displacement, and \nemployment);  and  (iv)  fostering  the  use  of  local  languages  in  education  and  other  written \nmaterials.  Increased  awareness  of  the  institutionalized  exclusion  of  indigenous  ethnic \ncommunities has encouraged people to question the status quo.   \n \n9. \nWhile there have been significant and positive changes in sociopolitical awareness and \ncaste,  and  ethnic  and  gender  relations,  the  conflict  has  also  had  a  negative  impact  on  local \ncultures. During the state of emergency, cultural gatherings were outlawed, as mass assemblies \nwere  suspected  of  being  motivated  by  the  Maoists.  People  were  not  able  to  move  freely  or \nattend  traditional  festivals  and  fairs.  On  one  side,  the  Maoists  claim  that  they  are  fighting  for \ncultural  freedom;  on  the  other,  they  are  campaigning  against  some  traditional  cultural \nceremonies  that  they  claim  are  economically  wasteful  and  socially  unprogressive.  In  many \nplaces,  Maoists  have  attempted  to  replace  traditional  and  religious  festivals  and  rituals  with \nmore secular gatherings such as May Day and People\u2019s War Day. \n \nProject  Implementation.  By  almost  all  criteria,10  the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western \n10. \nregions have suffered the most from the situation. However, loss of private land, equipment, and  \nassets  has  been  more  severe  in  Central  and  Midwestern  regions.  Negative  impacts  are \nrecorded  on  agriculture  production,  performance  of  agro-industry,  some  rural  infrastructures, \nand  wage  opportunities,  all  activities  covered  by  the  project  components.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented  under  a  conflict  situation  if  a  peaceful  resolution  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  near \nfuture.  Not  only  development  but  also  reconstruction/rehabilitation  strategies  will  be  involved. \nThe  security  situation  is  still  not  favorable  in  several  parts  of  the  project  area,  limiting  the \ndevelopment  and  investment  initiatives  and  monitoring  of  activities.  Recognizing  the  need  to \naccelerate  development  in  critical  areas,  the  Government  has  committed  special  efforts  since \n2001 to Far Western and Midwestern regions. \n \nGiven  the  recent  past  and  ongoing  development  experiences  and  lessons  learned  by \n11. \nvarious  Government  and  aid  agency  programs,  important  procedures  and  principles  to  be \n\n                                                 \n9  In  Maoist-controlled  villages,  wall  paintings  proclaiming  \u201cPreserve  Magar  Language  and  Culture,\u201d  \u201cOur  Culture  Is \n\nOur Identity,\u201d and \u201cEnsure People\u2019s Right to Culture\u201d are in virtually every public building. \n\n10 Total number  of people  displaced,  number  of displaced farmers and  agriculture  workers, number of  jobless after \n\ndisplacement of landowners, change in land tenure during conflict period, and decrease in number of animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nfollowed  to  ensure  (although  obviously  not  guarantee)  the  relative  success  of  activities  in \nconflict-affected areas were drawn. These measures also seek to increase the personal security \nof  project  staff  working  in  conflict-affected  areas.  Strategies  to  implement  the  Project  under \nconflict follow: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nMinimize  the  effects  of  conflict  by  maximizing  local  ownership  and  making \navailable  to  all  groups  in  the  local  community  on  an  equal  basis.  A  feeling  of \ndirect ownership cannot easily be developed if community participation is absent \nand no direct benefits are received from community programs. \nTo  reach  the  poorest  and  most  needy,  implement  targeted  income  generating \nactivities for women and ethnic groups based on a detailed survey of the project \nlocation. \nThrough  the  pro-poor  policy,  be  especially  attentive  to  cost  and  participation  of \nthe ultra poor households. \nIn  programming  decisions,  give  opportunities  to  ethnic  groups  to  participate  in \ndevelopment activities. \nGive special attention to policy, programs and financial transparency. \nTransparency is needed at all levels of the programs.  Maintain transparency for \nall groups in the local community in all program activities.11 \nImplement on the basis of felt needs, and not on the influence of people at higher \nlevels of leadership. \n\n(vii)  Recruit  implementation  agents,  including  nongovernment  organizations,  based \non their positive record of transparency, political neutrality, negotiation skills, and \nparticipatory attitude. \n\n(viii)  Make  the  necessary  arrangements  to  protect  the  identity  of  program  personnel \n\nfrom national security staff. \nImplement  alternative  sanitation  programs  (e.g.,  eco-sanitation)  in  areas  with \nwater shortage. \nAddress  promptly  complaints  raised  at  the  local  level.  Immediately  resolve \nconflict-oriented  problems. \nthe \nimplementation of village-level projects. \n\nlocal  people  welll \n\nin  advance  of \n\nInform \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi)  Make detailed project information (technical designs, cost budgets, individual and \ninstitutional  responsibilities,  etc.)  publicly  available  to  stakeholder  groups, \nofficials, political parties, and the general public. Make the program known at the \nlocal level by its own name rather than through the funding agency\u2019s name. \nThere is a potential contradiction between the need to tackle social exclusion and \nthe  need  to  recruit  staff  on  the  basis  of  suitability  and  qualification.  Agencies \nshould  (a)  avoid  imposing  unnecessary  and  irrelevant  qualifications  in  staff \nrecruitment,  while  maintaining  minimum  standards  (b)  interpret  suitability  to \ninclude  attitudes  and  behaviors  such  as  respect  for  the  dignity  of  people  their \nculture, religion and customs, and (c) give added weight to requirements that will \nenable them to comply with social inclusion \u2013 for example gender sensitivity and \nknowledge of local languages (as well as Nepali). \n\n                                                 \n11  In  current  circumstances,  agencies  have  to  rely  heavily  on  the  support  of  the  village  community  as  protection \nagainst interference by the Maoists. Transparency and accountability have become increasingly critical issues but \nare  terms  that  need  to  be  defined.  The  minimum  standard  suggested  by  the  Unite  Kingdom  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  is  the  following:  \u201cThe  Community  will  be  in  possession  of  full  financial \ninformation about the local project in which they are involved. This will be updated at least every three months and \nthey will have the opportunity to question agency activity at least every three months. As a normal practice financial \ninformation will be posted in a public place and will include any wages paid and the costs of materials plus a full \noverall presentation of finances. Ideally the agencies will develop comprehensive procedures for public auditing.\u201d  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR GENDER EQUALITY AND  \nEMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN

\n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nFOLLOW-UP SUPPORT TO MICROCREDIT PROJECT FOR WOMEN DISTRICTS \n \n\nThe overall goal of the the Microcredit Project for Women (MCPW)1 was to improve the \n1. \nsocioeconomic  status  of  women  in  Nepal  and  promote  their  participation  and  integration  in \nnational development and thus contribute to poverty reduction. The objective of the Project was \nto improve income and employment of poor women in 12 districts2 and five towns3 of Nepal. On \n24 June 1993, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nAsian  Development  Fund  resources  for  MCPW,  and  the  loan  agreement  was  signed  on  16 \nSeptember 1993. The loan was declared effective on 15 December 1993. On 31 March 2000, \nADB, at the Government\u2019s request, approved a 2-year extension of the loan closing date from \n30 June 2000 to 30 June 2002. The Project envisaged to train about 20,000 women and provide \ncredit  for  agricultural  production,  microenterprises  (MEs),  and  small  businesses  to  10,500, \n3,000, and 300 women, respectively. The remaining women beneficiaries were expected to rely \non  their  own  savings  or  to  obtain  credit  from  other  sources.  The  Department  of  Women \nDevelopment (DWD) and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) were the Executing Agencies of the Project. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  targets  were  achieved,  with  182  village  development  committee \n2. \n(VDC)  areas  covered  out  of  the  planned  180.  Of  the  planned  coverage  of  20,000  women \nbeneficiaries,  41,684  women  (208%)  were  reached  by  the  Project  through  the  formation  of \n6,512  women  self-help  groups.  Over  26,600  women  beneficiaries  received  basic  training  to \ncreate awareness on financial services, enterprise selection, and business finance; and 21,360 \nwomen received vocational skills training in various productive income-generating activities and \nME. The group members generated a total of about NRs64.7 million as group savings and from \nthese  savings,  NRs41.3  million  was  loaned  by  intralending  to  18,225 women  group  members. \nThe  participating  banks  (Nepal  Bank  Limited  and  Rastriya  Banijaya  Bank)  disbursed  about \nNRs395.4 million ($5.06 million) credit to 26,481 women beneficiaries. The project outreach is \nshown in Table A5.1. \n \nFor sustainability of the interventions, the Project focused on institutional development of \n3. \nwomen's informal groups as these informal groups could not be considered viable institutions. \nBoth  women  development  office  (WDO)  and  partner  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \norganized/federated  women  informal  groups  into  women\u2019s  savings  and  credit  cooperatives \n(SSC) through these steps: (i) informal groups within the wards were federated into committees, \n(ii)  committees  within  the  VDCs  were  federated  into  main  committees,  and  (iii)  the  main \ncommittees  were  encouraged  to  register  as  SCCs.  4  A  total  of  82  women  SCCs  (48  by  WDO \nand  34  by  partner  NGOs)  were  developed  under  the  Project.  The  SCCs  were  trained \nbookkeeping,  accounting,  and  savings  and  credit  management.  About  10,282  women \nbeneficiaries  (about  1,714  groups)  are  receiving  services  from  these  SCCs  and  there  is \nincreased  demand  from  women  SCCs  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  manage  microfinance  in  a \nprofessional way.  \n \n4. \nSufficient measures were built in within the DWD system for providing continuity to the \ncomponent  WDO  implemented  under  the  Project.  For  components  implemented  by  the  95 \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1993. Micro Credit Project for Women. Manila.

About  3,500  women\u2019s  groups  were  not  able  to  formalize  despite  the  considerable \ninitial support in their institutional development. Project completion report consultations revealed \nthat  SCCs  were  committed  to  expand  their  outreach,  but  are  constrained  by  shortage  of  loan \nfunds  and  limited  institutional  capacity.  They  have  inadequate  loanable  fund  to  meet  their \nmembers\u2019  demand  for  financial  services  as  members\u2019  savings  are  the  main  source  of  their \nloanable  funds.  Women  repeatedly  cited  their  first  priority:  strengthening  the  SCCs  by  linking \nthem  to  wholesale  loan  providers,  and  the  providing  follow-up  training  on  institutional \ndevelopment.  \n \n\nTable A5.1: Project Outreach \n\nItem \n\n \n\n1.

The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children \nand  Social  Welfare  (MOWCSW)  has  the  mandate  to  mainstream  women\u2019s  empowerment  and \ngender  into  all  government  programs  and  policies.  Programs  for  empowerment  and  gender \nmainstreaming  are  executed  by  the  Department  of  Women  Development  (DWD),  which  was \noriginally  formed  as  the  Women  Development  Office  (WDO)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment to implement the Production Credit for Rural Women project in 1982. The section \nbecame  a  department  (the  Women  Development  Department)  in  1991,  and  then  was \ntransferred to the MOWCSW as DWD in 2000. \n \n2. \nDepartment of Women Development. DWD has the mandate to improve the quality of \nlife, increase the socioeconomic status of women, and bring gender equity in Nepalese society. \nIt  focuses  specifically  on  the  income  poor  and  disadvantaged  women  and  their  households. \nDWD  implements  the  Women  Development  Program  (WDP),  comprising  three  principal \nprojects:  (i)  Production  Credit  for  Rural  Women,  (ii)  Micro  Credit  Project  for  Women  (MCPW); \nand,  (iii)  Women\u2019s  Awareness  and  Income  Generation  Program  (\u2018Jagriti\u2019).  DWD  coordinates \nprogramming with government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), financial institutions, and \nfunding agencies. \n \nDWD has a central administrative unit responsible for overall planning, implementation, \n3. \nmonitoring and evaluation of WDP  in Kathmandu. DWD implements through 75 district offices \n(referred to as WDO), one in each district of Nepal) and 96 unit suboffices. The director general \nheads  the  department  and  takes  overall  responsibility  for  program  implementation.  He  is \nsupported by directors, officers, and assistants. The program is implemented at the district level, \nwith a high degree of decentralized management authority and operational autonomy, through \nthe  WDO  headed  by  the  women  development  officers  (WDOfs),  assisted  by  a  supervisor,  an \naccountant  and  several  women  development  assistants  (WDAs).  Currently  involved  with  the \nWDD is a staff of 973. All WDOfs and WDAs are female staff. Within the Nepalese bureaucracy, \nDWD has the largest number of female staff working at the grassroots level. \n \nDWD  staff  are  directly  involved  in  group  formation,1  training,  community  development, \n4. \nand institutional development components of the WDP. DWD, during two decades of experience \nimplementing projects to empower women in rural Nepal, has built a national infrastructure and \nnetwork  that  reaches  every  district  of  Nepal.  DWD  staff  are  noted  for  their  dedication  and \ncommitment  to  development  principles  and  the  department\u2019s  work.  At  the  district  level,  WDO \ngenerally enjoys strong support of the line agencies, NGOs, and the community at large. \n \n5. \nThe  principal  and  most  negative  factor  affecting  DWD  is  financial  constraints.  In  2001, \nthe  development  budget  of  DWD  was  cut  by  more  than  80%,  leaving  very  limited  funds  for \nprograms and only sufficient resources to maintain the administrative and staff structure. There \nhave  been  further  budget  cuts  every  fiscal  year,  as  part  of  the  overall  Government  budget \nreductions arising from the budgetary deficit. This has been demotivational and demoralizing for \nall  DWD  staff,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  all  WDO  positions  are  temporary  and  on  6-month \ncontracts. Active programs in DWD are limited to those districts with ongoing externally funded \nprojects.  Consequently,  there  is  a  large  reserve  of  underutilized  human  resource  capacity  in \nDWD.  Remobilizing  and  remotivating  department  staff  constitute  a  human  resource \nmanagement challenge. \n\n                                                 \n1 WDO staff retain a strong reputation for effective group formation and social mobilization, especially among isolated \n\nand marginalized groups of women. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nline  agencies, \n\n \n6. \nPolitical  uncertainty  and  the  lack  of political  commitment  to  DWD  activities,  resulting  in \nno  budget  allocation,  were  also  identified  as  constraints.  Government  policy  was  unclear \nregarding  the  mandate  and  functions  of  DWD,  and  there  was  no  clear-cut  policy  mandate  for \nother government agencies to collaborate with DWD. In July 2003 a new Cabinet decision was \npassed that defines the WDO as the focal agency in the district for matters relating to women, \nminors, the disabled, the aged,  and to work with NGOs, i.e. representing the full mandate of the \nMOWCSW  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  This  implies  that  WDO  will  act  as  facilitator  and \ncoordinator,  rather  than  implementer,  and  will  procure  the  services  of  partner  agencies  and \noversee them in the implementation of activities. The responsibility for implementation rests with \ndistrict \ncommunity-based  organizations/NGOs,  Village  Development \nCommittees/District  Development  Committees,  and  private  sector  groups  with  proven  track \nrecords  of  successfully  implementing  community-based  projects.  The  MOWCSW  becomes \nmore  of  an  oversight  agency  to  ensure  that  women  have  appropriate  access  to  development \nprograms. \n \nTo fulfill this expanded and new role (facilitating, monitoring, supervising, and technical \n7. \nbackstopping rather than direct project implementation), the capacity of DWD at all levels needs \nto  be  enhanced.  In  addition  to  identified  training  and  professional  development  needs,  most \ndistrict-level  WDO  offices  will  require  additional  staff  (Table  A8)  and  improved  office  facilities. \nThe  central-level  DWD  will  require  upgrading  of  systems  capability  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and \nreport. \n \n\nTable A8: DWD District Staff Resources in the Project Area \n\nWDOf Supervisor\n\n District \n1 \n Achham  \n1 \n Baitadi \n1 \n Bajhang \n1 \n Bajura \n1 \n Doti \n0 \n Jumla \n0 \n Kalikot \n Mugu \n0 \n     Subtotal Western Cluster  5 \n Bara \n1 \n Dhanusha \n1 \n1 \n Sarlahi \n1 \n Sindhuli \n1 \n Rautahat \n1 \n Ramechhap \n1 \n Mahottari \n      Subtotal Central Cluster \n7 \n            Total \n  12 \n WDOf = women development officer,  DWD = Department of Women Development.  \n Source:  DWD.  \n \n\nAsst. \nAccountant\n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n7 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n6 \n       13 \n\nWomen \nWorkers\n2 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n3 \n0 \n0 \n    12 \n      2 \n      2 \n3 \n1 \n3 \n1 \n2 \n     14 \n     26 \n\n1 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n5 \n1 \n        1 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n6 \n       11 \n\nWomen \nVolunteers \n1 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n4 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n      15 \n        4 \n        2 \n3 \n4 \n3 \n3 \n1 \n      20 \n      35 \n\nOffice \nClerk  Peon Total\n2 \n 8 \n1 \n9 \n1 \n 8 \n1 \n 6 \n1 \n 9 \n1 \n 7 \n1 \n 4 \n1 \n 4 \n55 \n9 \n11 \n1 \n9 \n1 \n2 \n12 \n2 \n10 \n1 \n10 \n1 \n 7 \n2 \n 9 \n  68 \n  10 \n19  123 \n\n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n5 \n7 \n\n\fPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK AND FLOW OF FUNDS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFund Flow \n\nADB \n\nImprest Account \n \n\nConditional Funds for the Project\n\nExpenditure for CPMT \n\nDistrict Development Fund \n(non operating account) \n\nLDO and DDC account signs for the release of  Project \n\nProject Operating Account \n(Jointly operated by WDOf & WDO Accountant)\n\nWomen Developmnent \nSection \n\n \n\nDistrict Project \nTeam\n\nProposals Flow \n\nCentral Implementation \nCoordination Committee \n\nMOWCSW\n\nDWD \n \n \nCPMT  \n\nDistrict Implementation \nCoordination Committee\n\nDistrict Development \nCommittee Operating \naccount \n\nLine Agencies \nOperating Accounts \n\nP\n\nr\no\np\no\ns\na\ns\n \n\nl\n\nS\nu\nb\np\nr\no\ne\nc\nt\n \n\nj\n\nSmall Infrastructure \n \nEducation \n \nAgriculture \n \nOther as required \n\nNGOs \n\nPrivate Sector \nService Providers \n\nCBOs \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBO = community-based organization, CPMT = central project management team, DDC = district development committee, DWD = Department of\nWomen Development, MLD = Ministry of Local Development, MOWCSW = Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, NGO = nongovernment organization, NPC = National\nPlanning Commission, VDC = village development committee, WDO = women development office, WDOf = women development officer.   \n\n \n\nNPC \n\nMLD \n\nDistrict \nCouncil \n\nM\no\nn\n\ni\nt\n\no\nr\ni\nn\ng\n\n \n\ni\n\nD\ns\nt\nr\ni\nc\nt\n \n\nl\n\ni\n\n \n\nP\na\nn\nn\nn\ng\na\nn\nd\nA\np\n \np\nr\no\nv\na\n\n \n\nl\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4\n5\n\nDDC \n\nILAKA\n\nVDC \n\nWard \nCommittee \n\nCommunities/ \nSettlements \nCBOs\n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nYear 1\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\nYear 3\n2\n3\n\nYear 4\n2\n3\n\nYear 2\n2\n3\n\nYear 5\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n \n46       Appendix 10 \n\nItem\nA.

The consultants will: \n \n\nhelp  design  and  implement  appropriate  institutional  strengthening  programs  for \nDWD/women development office (WDO);  \n\nhelp  develop  the  capacity  of  local  organizations  and  local  subcontracting \nagencies to implement subprojects; \n\nhelp design and deliver appropriate training packages as required for the various \nproject components; \n\nhave  expertise  in  project  management,  gender  and  development  approaches, \ncommunity  mobilization  techniques  and  strategies,  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation, contracting and procurement, financial management and accounting, \nand management information systems (MIS) development; \n\nstrengthen  and  build  the  capacities  of  the  central  project  management  team \n(CPMT)  and  district  project  team  (DPT)  to  improve  management  capacities  for \nimplementing the project; and \n\nestablish and operate a MIS and project performance monitoring system (PPMS) \nwith DWD. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n2. \nConsultant time is front-loaded to assist in early start-up and implementation by helping \ndevelop  and  institutionalize  procedures  and  establish  the  project  institutional  framework  and \nmanagement  structures.    Follow-up  consultancy  assignments  are  designed  to  assess  the \nimpact of prior interventions and suggest procedural changes if required. As the Project evolves, \nthe  need  for  consultants  typically  diminishes  significantly.  However,  if  additional  or  extended \nconsultant needs are identified, project funds can be reallocated accordingly. \n\n3. \n\nTable A12 summarizes the consulting services needed for the duration of the Project. \n \n\nTable A12:  Consulting Services Requirements \n\nConsultant Level and Position \n\n \n \nInstitutional Development Specialist \nMonitoring  Evaluation  and  Management \nSystem  Specialist \nGender & Development Specialist \nGender / Social Development Specialist \nFinancial Management Specialist \nMonitoring and Evaluation Specialist \n\n                                     Total: \n\nPerson-Months \n\nInternationala \n \n4+1+1 \n4+1+1 \n\n4+3+2+1 \n\n \n \n \n22 \n\nDomesticb \n \n \n \n\n \n\n60 \n60 \n30 \n150 \n\na    Where  the  number  of  person  months  is  given  as  #+#,  it  indicates  #  months  in  the  first  year  of  project  \n\nimplementation and #   months in the second year. \n\nb   National level consultants\u2019 time allocation is in aggregated person-months over the length of the project. \n  \nSource:  ADB estimates. \n \n\n \n\nInformation \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12          49 \n\nInternational  Consultants \n\nto  develop  organizational  and \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nInstitutional Development Specialist (IDS). The IDS will work with DWD at the central \ninstitutional  capacity-building \nproject  management  unit \nframeworks  to  enable  DWD  to  address  the  identified  capacity  needs.  The  IDS  will  lead  the \norganizational  audit  of  DWD.  The  IDS  will  (i)  review  overall  vision,  mission,  and  mandate  of \nDWD  and  how  the  DWD  contributes  to  the  mandate  of  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and \nsocial Welfare (MOWCSW) as facilitators and coordinators for gender mainstreaming across the \ngovernment; (ii) review recent work plans and reports of DWD and other relevant departments \nof  MOWSCW  and  assess  actual  contributions  made  by  DWD  to  the  overall  mandate  of  both \nDWD  and  MOWCSW;  (iii)  review  DWD  organizational  and  management  structure;  (iv)  review \nthe allocation of business across different DWD divisions in the context of its vision/mission; (v) \nreview  mechanisms  in  place  for  planning  and  monitoring  work  plans  for  DWD  and  how  these \nlink  to  work  planning  process  of  MOWCSW;  (vi)  review  the  staffing  structure  of  DWD  i.e. \nnumber of staff, classifications and job descriptions and assess institutional capacity at central \nand  district  levels;  (vii)  review  structures  and  procedures  in  place  to  carry  out  the  work  plans \nfrom  each  division  of  DWD  and  the  DWD  management  reporting  systems  and  requirements; \n(viii)  review  human  resource  capabilities  and  requirements  of  DWD  and  prepare  a  long-term \nhuman resources development plan that incorporates a detailed plan for capacity development \nfor  DWD,  MOWCSW,  and  other  relevant  government  agencies  for  the  duration  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank-supported empowerment of women project; (ix) assess the extent to which \nthe capabilities and experience of staff in DWD match the expected outputs in the work plans \nand vision/mission of both DWD and MOWCSW and recommend different skills and capacities \nrequired to carry out the revised mandate of both; (x) assess mechanisms in place that facilitate \nleadership  and  innovation  from  staff  at  DWD  and  recommend  changes  to  existing  structures \nand  procedures  within  DWD  that  will  facilitate  and  encourage  leadership  and  innovation  as \nDWD's  new  role  evolves;  (xi)  assess  coordination  mechanisms  in  place  between  internal \ndivisions  of  DWD  (particularly  between  district  and  central  levels),  and  between  DWD  and \nMOWCSW  and  other  branches  of  the  government  (including  DWD  and  other  government \nagencies  at  the  district  level),  and  recommend  new  procedures,  mechanisms,  capacities,  and \ntools that might be appropriate to facilitate greater coordination, in monitoring and evaluation. \n \n5. \nThe  organizational  audit  should  be  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner  that  ensures \ninput from staff at all levels of DWD and MOWCSW as well as a representational sample from \nother government agencies with which DWD interacts. \n \n6. \nThe  recommendations  expected  from  these  tasks  require  a  senior  consultant  with  at \nleast  15  years  of  experience  with  human  resources  and  change  management  in  the  public \nsector.  Experience  with  implementing  policies  associated  with  gender  mainstreaming  and \nemployment equity will also be necessary. \n \n7. \nMonitoring,  Evaluation,  and  MIS  Specialist.  The  specialist  will  work  closely  with  the \nDWD monitoring, evaluation and coordination unit to: (i) review current monitoring formats and \nprocedures,  (ii)  establish  a  gender-disaggregated  project  database  for  monitoring  gender \nindicators,  (iii)  develop  and  implement  a  computerized  MIS  suitable  for  the  identified \nrequirements of DWD, and (iv) validate and test the quality of the data from the databases. \n \n8. \nGender and Development Specialist.

The  specialist  will  work  closely  with  the  DWD \nmonitoring,  evaluation  and  coordination  unit  and  the  DWD  central-level  administration  and \naccounts  units  to  (i)  determine  information  needs  for  project  monitoring  and  reporting,  (ii) \nestablish monitoring parameters of project related activities, (iii) oversee the establishment of a \ncomprehensive  monitoring  database  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  sectoral  monitoring  unit \nand the Project, (iv) develop monitoring procedures for central and district project management \nunits, and (v) orient and train central and district staff in monitoring procedures. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n\nApproach and Assumptions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  is  built  on  the  rationale  that  women's  lot  in  Nepal  needs  to  be  uplifted  as \n1. \ntheir  restricted  access  to  assets,  education,  and  health  and  other  social  facilities  limits  their \nincome-earning opportunities and relegate them to the level of unskilled labor with low wages. \nEmpowering women means that approximately 50% of the country's human resources that have \nnot  been  able  to  realize  their  full  potential  can  contribute  more  effectively  to  the  country's \nproductivity  and  economic  performance.  Not  all  the  benefits  of  empowerment  are  quantifiable; \nsome are not even identifiable at this stage. As such, calculating financial and economic internal \nrates  of  return  for  the  Project  may  be  meaningless.  Instead,  this  analysis  tries  to  identify  all \nquantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  benefits  for  each  component  and  qualitatively  analyze  the \ndistributive effects.  In  view  of  the  security  conditions,  which  do  not  allow  extensive  field  visits, \nthis  analysis  is  largely  based  on  secondary  data  from  ongoing  project  and  those  under \npreparation. \n \n2. \nThe  project  implementation  period  is  assumed  to  be  5  years.  The  project  benefits  are \nassumed  to  extend  over  7  years  for  microenterprises  (MEs)  and  15  years  for  minor  social \ninfrastructure. Project costs and benefits are estimated in 2003 constant prices. The basic daily \nwage varies by district and region; the average of NRs83 per day is used. The working day is \nassumed to be 10 hours/day for 250 days per annum. The shadow wage rate is taken as 0.53 of \nthe basic daily wage, consistent with the rate used in Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects \nin Nepal. The overall security conditions are assumed to stabilize at the current position. \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Empowerment \n\n \n3. \nThis component will cover 8 districts in the Western cluster, 7 in Central cluster,  and 12 \ndistricts and 5 towns where the Microcredit Project for Women (MCPW) was implemented. It will \ninvolve  80  village  development  committee  territories:  30  in  the  terai  and  50  in  the  hills  and \nmountains. Although services and training will be provided to 30,000 women, it is assumed that \nonly half of them will become serious micro entrepreneurs and continue to operate these MEs \nthroughout  the  project  period.  About  60%  of  the  micro-entrepreneurs  are  assumed  to  be  from \nthe terai, with the balance from the hills and mountains. \n \n4. \nThe Project will provide microcredit (through grant funds) as well as training and linkages \nto  help  women  gain  access  to  resources  and  credit  for  undertaking  MEs.  The  provision  of \nmicrocredit  and  linking  women's  groups  to  formal  and  organized  financial  institutions  allow \naccess to credit at lower interest rate, hence reducing the cost of credit to women. Awareness of \nformal and organized microcredit institutions as well as improved access to credit will give rise \nto MEs that generate income. \n \nThe  types  of  MEs  are  not  known  at  this  stage  and  will  be  decided  by  the  women \n5. \nthemselves  based  on  the  skills,  local  materials,  and  available  resources.  The  scale  and \nprofitability of the enterprises will differ in the terai and hills and mountain regions due to market \naccess  and  availability  of  materials.  Experience  from  MCPW  shows  that  most  of  the  Mes  are \nagriculture-based,  with  livestock  production  being  the  preferred  activity,  followed  by  vegetable \nproduction.  The  Crop  Diversification  Project  indicates  that  there  is  potential  for  production  of \nonions,  potatoes,  and  vegetables  for  the  local  market.  The  United  Nations  Development \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nProgram  Micro-enterprise  Development  Project  shows  that  the  preferred  MEs  are  trading  and \nservices in the terai and agro-forestry-based activities in the hills. The expected breakdown of \nMes by sector in the terai, and hills and mountains are in Table A13.1. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Breakdown of Microenterprises by Sector and Geographical Zone \n \n\nSector \n\n% ME in Terai \n\nAgriculture \nLivestock \nTrade and \nservices \nManufacturing \n \n\n    ME = microenterprise \n    Source:  ADB estimates. \n\n15 \n45 \n30 \n\n10 \n \n\n% ME in Hills and \nMountains \n20 \n60 \n15 \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nThe  benefit  streams  emanate  from  (i)  MEs  that  women  are  likely  to  undertake  with \n6. \nempowerment, and (ii) employment opportunities arising from skills training. The indicative net \ncash  flow,  internal  rates  of  return,  and  labor  requirement  of  sample  MEs  are  set  out  in  Table \nA13.1.  Table  A13.1  shows  that  MEs  are  viable  and  give  a  steady  stream  of  income  within  a \nshort  time.  The  labor  requirement  is  low\u20131\u20132  workers\u2013  and  can  generally  be  met  by  family \nmembers,  with  limited  use  of  hired  labor.  The  immediate  beneficiaries  are  expected  to  be  the \nbetter-off  women  who  have  the  resources  and  ability  to  take  risks.  Success  of  these \nentrepreneurs is expected to have a demonstration effect on other women and encourage them \nto undertake similar enterprises. Moreover, the income generated will give rise to a demand for \ngoods  and  services  within  the  community,  further  promoting  other  MEs.  The  short  gestation \nperiod  of  such  MEs  will  enable  this  component  to  quickly  yield  tangible  benefits  in  the \ncommunity,  but success depends greatly on general economic growth  and factors that disrupt \neconomic growth, including deteriorating security  conditions that are likely to limit  mobility and \nmarket access. \n\nTable A13.2: Summary of Financial Analysis of Sample Microenterprises \n\nInternal Rate of Return \n(%) \n\u2015 \n\nType of \nMicroenterprise \nSummer Vegetable            \n\nProduction \n\nWinter Vegetable \n\nProduction  \n\nGinger Production \n\nCitrus Production \n(0.05 ha) \n\nBuffalo Milk and Heifer \n\nProduction \n\nGoat Production (herd \n\nsize 6) \nPig Production \n\n(herd size 6) \n\nPoultry Farming \n\n(flock size 100) \n\nBag Making \n\nTea and Refreshment \n\nShop \n\nNet Cash Flow \n(NRs) \n2,889  \nper katha \n2,943 \nper katha \n5,860 \nper katha \n16,567 p.a. \nover 7 years \n14,535 p.a. \nover 7 years \n11,058 p.a. \nover 7 years \n8,483 p.a.  \nover 7 years \n27,659 p.a. \nover 7 years \n37,393 p.a. \nover 7 years \n110,245 p.a. \nover 7 years \n\nLabor Requirement \n(person days) \n30 \nper season \n30 \nper season \n30 \nper season \n125 p.a. \n\n125 p.a. \n\n125 p.a. \n\n125 p.a. \n\n250 p.a. \n\n500 p.a. \n\n500 p.a. \n\n\uf8e7 = not available, Ha = hectare, NRs = Nepalese Rupees, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\u2015 \n\n\u2015 \n\n23 \n\n33 \n\n31 \n\n30 \n\n38 \n\n25 \n\n25 \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\n2. \n\nLegal Empowerment  \n\n \n7. \nThe legal empowerment component seeks to put in place property rights for women that \nwill increase women's access to assets, thus increasing their access to credit and resources to \nundertake  MEs.  The  Project  will  indirectly  support  the  registration  for  citizenship,  which  is  a \nrequirement  for  credit  and  job  application,  thus  indirectly  increasing  women's  access  to  credit \nand job opportunities. The support for birth certificates will increase access to education for girls \nand  boys.  Legislative  changes,  increased  awareness  of  legislation,  and  improved  access  to \nlegal  institutions  will  offer  women  protection  from  rape,  domestic  violence,  and  crime.  A \nperceived  reduction  in  such  threats  will  encourage  women  to  venture  out  and  participate  in \neconomic activities, thus contributing to the economic production of goods and services. It must \nbe pointed out that the benefits from this component are likely to be realized at the end of the \nproject  period,  if  not  after  the  project  period,  when  the  changes  in  property  rights  and  other \nlegislation are fully enforced. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Empowerment  \n\ntimesaving  household  devices  will  benefit  38,500  women; \n\n8. \nThe  social  empowerment  component  aims  to  enable  more  women  to  participate  more \neffectively  in  community  and  group  self-development  activities  by  reducing  the  drudgery  and \ntime  spent  on  household  chores  such  as  fetching  water  and  collecting  firewood.  Introducing \nimproved  household  devices  and  community-based  social  infrastructure  will  result  in  time \nsavings.  Household  timesaving  devices  include  improved  fuel-efficient  cooking  stoves,  biogas \nplants, and efficient mills while community-based infrastructure includes gender-sensitive water \nsupply,  sanitation  schemes,  local  trails  and  bridges.  Household  timesaving  devices  and \ncommunity-based infrastructure will be provided on a demand-driven basis. It is envisaged that \nthe \nthe  community-based \ninfrastructure will benefit 38,600 women. It is possible that the beneficiaries of the time-saving \ndevices and community-based infrastructure and therefore the total number of beneficiaries for \nthis component will not be considerably less than 77,100. \n \n9. \nThe biogas plants and improved fuel-efficient cooking stoves are estimated to save the \nwomen  90  minutes  in  cooking  time  each  day.  Biogas  plants  will  eliminate  the  need  to  collect \nfirewood in the terai; firewood collection will be limited to the winter season when temperatures \nare too cold for the biogas plant to work. The improved stoves will reduce the fuel requirement \nby  30%,  and  hence  save  time  spent  in  collecting  firewood  by  30.  The  total  time  saved  in \ncollecting  firewood  and cooking  is  estimated  at 150  minutes  per  day.  Some  of  the time  saved \ncould be used for income-generating employment on- or off-farm, but a considerable amount of \nthe  time  saved  can  be  spent  on  caring  for  the  family  or  resting.  Regardless  of  how  the  time \nsaved  is  used,  it  is  an  economic  benefit  and  is  valued  at  NRs2,750  per  annum.  The \nnonquantifiable  benefits  include  reduced  respiratory  and  eye  infection  caused  by  smoke  and \nreduced degradation of forests as a result of reduced firewood requirements. \n \n10. \nThe  Project  will  provide  community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  for \n12,600 households in 201 communities. This will considerably reduce the time women spend in \nfetching  water.  Some  households  report  that  they  walk  up  to  30  minutes  to  fetch  water  for \nhousehold use. If the women fetch water twice a day, then they need to spend 120 minutes for \nthis  activity.  A  community-based  water  supply  is  expected  to  at  least  halve  the  time  spent \nfetching  water.  The  economic  cost  of  time  saved  is  NRs1,100  per  annum.  Improved  hygiene \nand reduced infection resulting from improved latrines are nonquantifiable. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nRehabilitating local trails and bridges will improve access for remote villages, giving rise \n11. \nto  opportunities  for  marketing  local  produce  and  MEs.  Economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  the \nincome  generated  from  marketing  local  produce  and  goods  and  services  from  MEs.  As  the \ndegree of market access and promotion of MEs will vary greatly depending on the geographic \nlocation  and  terrain,  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  economic  benefits  of  these  trails.  An \nestimated 9,200 women are expected to benefit to rehabilitate trails. \n \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening  \n\n \n12. \nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  seeks  to  ensure  that  women's  voices  are \nheard  and  to  increase  women's  participation  in  local  institutions  and  organizations.  Such \nparticipation will bring about sensitiveness to issues related to women. The long-term impact of \ninstitutional strengthening will be then improved status of women as well as better opportunities \nto  participate  in  economic,  social,  and  community  activities.  The  immediate  beneficiaries  are \nwomen  leaders  or  those  with  position  in  the  community.  Such  women  are  more  aware  of  the \nprograms and also have more time to participate in activities. Their participation is essential as \nthe  respect  they  command  in  the  community  will  enable  them  to  reach  the  other  less \nadvantaged women. As is the case in the legal empowerment component, the benefits of this \ncomponent are expected to be realized in the later part of and after the project period. \n \n\n5. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n13. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  direct  effect  on  strengthening  Department  of  Women  and \nDevelopment and women workers and increasing their outreach to women. In the medium and \nlong term, this effect will give rise to increased income generated by women either through MES \nor employment. The Project can also potentially increase the economic output of women as a \nresult  of  time  saved  through  time-saving  devices  and  facilities  of  the  community  social \ninfrastructure. The nonquantifiable benefits will be in the form of better health and better access \nto  education  and  employment  opportunities  as  well  as  protection  from  crime  and  domestic \nviolence. Overall, the Project will have substantial quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits for \nwomen and, therefore, the entire Nepalese society. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nThe Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognize that poverty in Nepal is exacerbated \nby deep-rooted cultural practices, which have historically isolated women and other disadvantaged groups \nfrom the benefits of growth and development.1  Progress to address caste- and ethnicity-based exclusion \nremains limited, but recognition of these problems in the Government\u2019s 10th Plan is encouraging. The ADB \n2004\u20132006 Country Strategy and Program promotes gender and socially inclusive development as one of \nits program focus areas. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification:  Targeted Intervention \n\n \nThe human development index (HDI) ranks Nepal 143 out of 175 countries, lower than all Asian countries \nbut  Pakistan.2  While  the  overall  HDI  for  Nepal  is  low,  the  index  disaggregated  by  regions  highlights  the \ninequity  of  development  across  Nepal.  Marked  disparities  occur  between  urban  and  rural  areas  and \nbetween ecological zones. Head count index, poverty gap index and squared poverty gap index, confirm \nthese disparities. The head count index, for example, places below the poverty line 56% of the population \nin the mountains, 41% in the hills, and 42% in the terai; whereas 23% in the urban areas and 44% in the \nrural areas of the population live below the poverty line.3 Not only spatial disparities in incomes and human \ndevelopment  are  important  elements  of  poverty  in  Nepal;  gender,  ethnicity  and  caste-related  differentials \nadd to the complexity, and exacerbate the intensity and depth of poverty.4 \n \nPoverty  and  Gender.  Social  exclusion,  determined  by  caste  and  gender,  is  one  major  reason  for \npersistent  poverty  and,  at  each  level  in  the  caste  system  or  within  an  ethnic  group,  women  are  more \ndisadvantaged  than  men.  The  gender-related  development  index  as  an  expression  of  the  differences \nbetween men and women in the HDI shows similar regional differences, but an overall positive trend. The \ngender empowerment measure assesses women\u2019s participation in economic and political life as very low \nwith a wide gap between urban and rural areas and the women in the hills faring the worst. \n \nPoverty, Low Caste, and Ethnic Groups. Nepalese society is multiethnic and multilingual, with complex \nvariations in ethnicity, caste, language, and religion.5About two thirds of the total population are directly tied \nto  the  Hindu  caste  framework,  with  the  remaining  comprising  various  non-caste  ethnic  and  non-Hindu \nreligious groups. The National Code of Nepal (1854) structured the Nepali society into a four-tier \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

The Tenth Plan (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) 2002/03-2006/07. \n\nKathmandu. \n\n5   The 1991 National Census reports 60 caste/ethnic groups and 20 different languages. The 2001 National Census \nconsiders  103  caste/ethnic  groups  and  93  different  languages,  with  Nepali  being  the  official  language,  mother \ntongue to over 48% of the population. There are 57.1% of the population included in caste groups, 34.8% in ethnic \ngroups  and  8.1%  of  others,  including  Muslim  and  Christians.  About  67%  of  the  population  originated  from  hill \nareas,  32%  from  the  terai  and  0.7%  from  the  mountains.  About  80%  of  the  population  follows  the  Hindu  religion \nwith the next largest groups being Buddhists (11%), and Muslims constituting 4% of the total population.  \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \ncaste hierarchy, placing the Brahmin on top, followed by the Chetri, Baisya and Shudra, and the high caste \nNewari,  the  middle  ranked  being  indigenous  groups  (janajatis)6  of  the  hill  and  mountain  areas.  The \n\"touchables\"  followed  by  the  \"untouchables\"  (the  dalits)  were  placed  at  the  bottom-end  of  the  hierarchy.7 \nThe Hindu caste system prevails in central and southern Nepal, but clear-cut differences between castes \nand ethnic groups, except for the more prominent castes like Brahmin and Chetri, do not necessarily exist. \nEthnic  groups  may  themselves  be  subdivided  into  hierarchies  of  occupational  castes.  The  society  is \ngoverned by a sophisticated system of rules and behavioral norms, and the caste system defines access to \nresources and opportunities. Upward mobility is extremely limited. However, while there does not seem to \nbe a simple straightforward correlation between the rank in the traditional caste system and poverty level, \nthere are broad linkages. The poverty level among the upper social castes is generally low. In most cases \nthe  Janajati  groups  have  higher  poverty  levels  (45-59%)  than  the  national  average,  while  the  dalits  have \npoverty levels as high as 65-68%. There are some notable deviations from this generalization. The upper \ncaste  Chetri  have  an  above  average  poverty  rate  of  50%,  while  the  Muslims,  although  low  in  the  social \nhierarchy, are relatively better off. There is considerable variation in the welfare status of different Janajati \ngroups.8 \n \nCharacteristics  of  Poverty.  People  can  be  grouped  to  four  categories:  (i)  vulnerable,  (ii)  poor,  (iii) \nmedium, and (iv) well off. Their characteristics are summarized in the table below: \n \n\nTable A14.1: Charateristics of the Vulnerable, Poor, Medium and Well Off \n\nWell-Being Ranking \nVulnerable \n\nCharacteristics \n\nlack of inherited assets \nlow education and low labor capacity (a 25 to 30% dependency ratio) \nno land nor livestock \nsmall and low quality houses \nfood production sufficient for less than 3 months \nfrom low caste/ethnic origin \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  mainly wage laborers (either locally or migrating to the Terai) \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nheavily  indebted  during  lean  season;  alcoholism,  and  disabled/sick  family  members  \nincrease their vulnerability. \nalmost no inherited assets \nless than 0.1hectare (ha) of cultivable rain-fed land per family member and at most one \ncattle \nlow education \n\nfood production sufficient for less than 5 months \nfrom dalits and ethnic groups, with a few high caste members \nsome inherited assets \n0.1\u20130.3 ha of cultivable land per family member and 2-5 cattle \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  mostly involved in farming and seasonal employment (either locally or migrating) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  with permanent job, pensions, remittances, small businesses, or cash crops \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  with some saving capacity in good years \n\u2022  more than 2 ha of cultivable land and inherited assets \n\u2022 \n\u2022  well educated \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  with savings \n\nbetter educated \nlarge families \ngood labor productivity  \nleasing and sharecropping occasionally  \nsecure food \n\npermanent employment, pensions or remittances, or farming business \nsecure food throughout the year \n\nhigh labor productivity \n\nPoor  \n\nMedium \n\nWell-off \n\n                                                 \n6  Janajatis have their own language and culture and are not included under the Hindu caste structure.  \n7   Detailed information on the dalits is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n8  Thakali and Sherpas, who have done well in trading and other businesses and fare higher in income indicators are \n\nbetter off.

Three ethnic/caste \ngroups  generally  dominate,  with about 70%  of  the population:  most  often  they consist  of Chetri,  Brahmin \nand  one  other  dalit  group.  Diversity  of  other  ethic/castes  origins  is  limited.  The  settlement  pattern  is \nrelatively  homogeneous,  with  single  ethnic/caste  groups  forming  clusters  within  a  ward.10  This  suggests \nsocial cohesion and long historical relationship between households and it seems favorable for community \nparticipation and social grouping. But strong historical relationships and remoteness are not conducive to \nattitudinal and behavioral changes and the reduction of discriminatory practices. In the Western cluster the \nvulnerable and poor population makes up 22% and 35% respectively, the medium group is 30%, and the \nwell-off  group  is  13%.  In  the  last  30  years,  the  rural  population  has  embarked  in  a  diversified  livelihood \nsystem.  With  the  increased  population  density  over  resources,  farming  system  intensification  became \nmandatory.  Small  farm  size  and  high  land  fragmentation  within  families  of  landowners  do  not  encourage \ninteresting commercial agriculture, and limit the local demand for seasonal   employment. Access network \nof limited and poor quality also constraints the mobility of people and access to district and regional markets. In the \nWest, most of the rural communities have modified or diversified their sources of income by (i) migrating \npermanently to the terai or to towns; (ii) seeking seasonal employment in the terai, towns, and Punjab; or \n(iii) migrating overseas. These strategies released the pressure on land and in brought external income to \nsustain life in the area. Estimates indicate that incomes from migration represent between 40% and 60% of \nthe total income, and more than 60% of the cash income. Migrating is not a coping mechanism anymore, \nbut a permanent component of the livelihood system in western Nepal. \n \n\n                                                 \n9 Detailed information on the two clusters and their livelihood is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n10  A ward is the lowest administrative unit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nSocial Stratification and Characteristics of Poverty in the Central Cluster. Ethnic/caste diversity in the \nCentral cluster is very high, with 51 different caste/ethnic groups to be distinguished. There is a much wider \nmosaic  of  caste/ethnic  groups,  several  of  them  migrated  from  the  hills,  mountains,  and  India.  The  most \nimportant  groups  are  the  Yadav  (12.3%  of  the  population),  Muslim  (11%),  Thamang  (6.3%),  Brahmin-hill \n(4.5%),  and  Tharu  (3.7%).  Settlement  patterns  show  clusters  formed  of  nuclei  of  endemic  castes/ethnic \ngroups, which were joined by other ethnic/caste groups in the last 40-50 years. The new groups came to \nfind  land,  to  benefit  from  easy  communication  and  market,  or  more  recently  to  escape  the  Maoist \ninsurgency from the hills and mountain areas. The new groups live closely together, and keep their social \nreferences,  traditional  livelihoods,  and  habitat  pattern.  However,  development  initiatives  modify  the  social \nand  economic  dynamics  of  the  communities  and  challenge  the  power  relations,  in  which  caste/ethnic \nissues are of primary importance. Social cohesion and participation in development efforts therefore cannot \nreadily  be  assumed.  In  the  Central  cluster,  the  vulnerable  and  the  poor  comprise  31%  and  32%  of  the \npopulation, 28% are considered as medium, and 9% as well-off. \n \nIn the terai districts, with large flat land of alluvial soil and excellent groundwater resources, the traditional \nrural  system  is  based  on  food  and  commercial  cropping,  and  livestock  husbandry.  Due  to  the  very  high \npopulation  density,  combined  with  small  farm  size  and  high  land  fragmentation,  food  subsistence  and \ncommercial  agriculture  alone  are  not  sufficient  for  most  of  the  rural  households.  Rich  and  medium \nsocioeconomic groups have turned to trade, business, out-migration, permanent paid job, agro-processing, \nand small or medium-scale commercial agriculture. Vulnerable and poor groups seek local employment in \nfarming,  brick  making,  sand  collection,  construction,  low  paid  urban  services,  or  migrate  to  Punjab. \nSavings, if any, are invested in livestock, buy and sell business, or cottage industry.  because of the range \nof  altitude  and  the  variations  in  soil  types  in  the  central  and  northern  parts  of  the  hills,  cropping  systems \ngreatly vary. While monsoon crops are usually for the household consumption, farmers with more than 1 ha \nof  irrigated  land  can  produce  off-season  commercial  crops,  including  high-value  crops,  and  several  fruit \ntrees. \n \nC.         Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), a survey combined qualitative and quantitative \ntechniques  to  assess  poverty  in  the  project  area  and  the  linkages  with  issues  of  gender  equality  and \nempowerment  of  women  (EOW).  Community  resources,  social  mobility  mapping,  and  participant \nobservation  were  used.  Focus  group  discussions  addressed  economic,  social,  legal,  and  political \ndimensions of EOW as perceived and practiced by the communities.  The social assessment is based on \nwork  done  by  the  PPTA  consultants  and  the  ADB  missions\u2019  findings.  All  the  stakeholders  participated \nactively  designing  and  preparing  the  Project  through  local  consultations  and  regional  workshops.  The \nactivities  in  the  economic  and  social  empowerment  components  will  be  implemented  using  participatory \nmethods on a demand-driven basis \n \nD.          Gender and Development  \n \nThe  thematic  of  the  Project  is  gender  and  development.  The  project  beneficiaries  are  poor  rural  women \nwho have not benefited from past development programs. All activities focus on poor ethnic and low-caste \ngroups  to  ensure  that  benefits  will  accrue  more  readily  to  these  disadvantaged  groups.  The  Project  will \nwork,  not  only  with  existing  groups,  but  also  with  newly  formed  women\u2019s  groups  to  allow  the  historically \nexcluded women to participate in the Project. \n \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n\fSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \n\nNone \n\n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nresettlement  will  be \n\nSmall-scale community infrastructure interventions include \nthe  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  trails  and  bridges, \nsmall-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  and \ncommunity-based  multi-purpose  women\u2019s  centers.
