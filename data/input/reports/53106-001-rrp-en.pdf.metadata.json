The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan of up to $7,600,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Sector Infrastructure Fund \n(LEAP)1. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2. \nThe  loan  will  support  the  borrower  with  long-term  financing  to  operate  a  50-megawatt \n(MW) photovoltaic solar power plant and its associated facilities in Tay Ninh Province, Viet Nam. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-\ntenor, United States (US) dollar-denominated project financing, which local financial institutions \nare unable to provide. The financing will also catalyze commercial loans for one of the first large-\nscale solar power project finance transactions in the country. ADB\u2019s participation in the project \nwill also ensure compliance with rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n3. \nProject identification. High rates of economic growth and accelerated industrialization \nand urbanization are leading to growing demand for electricity in Viet Nam, which is on a path to \nbecoming the second-largest power market in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia) in the next five to \nten years. Access to electricity, which was below 10% of the population in 1986, is now nearly \nuniversal (98.7% in 2018). Electricity demand has grown rapidly in recent years, averaging 12.0% \nper year from 2005 to 2018, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% per year through 2030. \nHowever, meeting fast-growing electricity demand and sustaining high rates of economic growth \nto improve livelihoods will be a significant challenge for Viet Nam. \n \n4. \nStrong  projected  growth  in  electricity  demand  will  require  significant  private  sector \ninvestment in the energy sector. According to the National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020 \n(PDP VII),  Viet  Nam  needs  to  invest  about  $148  billion  in  power  transmission  and  generation \ninfrastructure from 2011 to 2030 to sustain high rates of economic growth.2  At the same time, the \nVietnamese energy sector is undergoing reforms to gradually deregulate and introduce market \nprinciples to encourage greater private sector participation. Because of the financial constraints \nof the state utility, Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the large exposure of domestic banks to state-owned \nenterprises,  and  limits  to  sovereign  borrowing,  private  sector  investment  will  be  essential  if \nViet Nam is to avoid future power shortages.  \n  \n5. \nAs  of  2016,  hydropower,  coal,  and  gas  comprised  nearly  90%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  then \n42 gigawatts  (GW)  of  installed  power  capacity.  With  limited  potential  to  develop  large-scale \nhydropower  plants  further,  depleting  domestic  coal  reserves,  and  growing  public  concern  over \nenvironmental issues regarding coal-fired power plants, the development of renewable energy is \nreceiving greater focus. Viet Nam\u2019s revised PDP VII seeks to increase the share of renewable \nenergy, including small hydro, solar, wind, and biomass power plants, as a percentage of total \nforecast installed capacity to 21% (27 GW) by 2030 and to reduce the use of imported coal-fired \n\n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \n2  Government of Viet Nam. 2016. National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020, with outlook to 2030. Ha Noi. \n\n \n\n\f2  \n\nelectricity. To meet this target, installed solar power capacity is expected to increase to 12 GW \nand wind power to 6 GW by 2030. Rapidly scaling up renewable energy use will also help Viet \nNam achieve its target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8%\u201325% by 2030. \n \nIn April 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 11/2017/QD-TTg to accelerate the \n6. \ndevelopment of private sector solar projects. This decision includes a provision for a 20-year feed-\nin tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale solar power projects. Developers \nwishing to receive the FIT were required to reach commercial operations by 30 June 2019 and \nuse the standard power purchase agreement (PPA) issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. \nAs a result of this policy, many local and international companies entered the market to develop \nsolar power projects in Viet Nam and benefit from the attractive FIT. By June 2019, 82 solar power \nplants, with a total capacity of nearly 4.5 GW, were commissioned and connected to the national \ngrid. This is much more than the target of 850 MW solar power by 2020 set out in the PDP VII, \nand the share of solar power in the country\u2019s power mix has consequently increased from less \nthan 0.5% to almost 10% in just a few months. While this is a great success story in terms of \nrenewable  energy  development,  the  need  for  sustainable  financing  solutions  remains  of \nparamount importance. \n \n7. \nTo qualify for the higher tariff, many developers decided to finance projects entirely with \nsponsor equity, short-term supplier credit, or corporate loans with short tenors in dong, delaying \nlong-term project financing consideration to a later stage.3 As evidenced by their market entry, \nthis project structure provided sufficiently high risk-adjusted expected returns for these developers \nwhen they could lock in a $0.0935 per kWh tariff. However, it exposes developers to significant \nrefinancing  risks  in  a market  that  does  not  have  well-established  project  finance  structures  for \nsolar  power  projects,  especially  because  the  standard  PPA  is  not  considered  bankable  for \ninternational lenders on a nonrecourse project finance basis. While local financial institutions are \nmore comfortable with the standard PPA, they lack experience with project finance, have limited \nfinancing capacity, and are unable to provide US dollar funding. Without access to long-term US \ndollar debt financing, international solar developers will be unable to recycle capital into project \ndevelopment and will struggle to build new projects once FITs are reduced in subsequent rounds \nof development. Without a viable project finance market for solar power in Viet Nam, the initial \nsurge of interest may not be sustained, making it more likely that fossil fuels will meet the rapidly \ngrowing power demand. \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s involvement in this project will support one of the first international limited-recourse \nfinancings for a solar power project in Viet Nam and will help to reduce commercial cofinanciers\u2019 \nrisk perception of renewable energy in Viet Nam at a critical time for the sector. ADB has taken \nthe lead in structuring a project finance solution with tailor-made sponsor support to address key \nrisks in Viet Nam\u2019s standard PPA for renewable energy and will ensure compliance with rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards. ADB will also mobilize commercial financing from \nregional and international lenders using a B loan structure. Additional support from concessional \nfunding provided by LEAP will improve the bankability and financial viability of the project, helping \nto catalyze the transaction and unlock access to long-term debt from international and regional \nbanks for utility-scale solar projects in Viet Nam. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n \n\n3  The  sponsors  of  the  proposed  project  proceeded  with  the construction  using  shareholder  loans in  order  to  reach \n\ncommercial operations by 30 June 2019. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n \n9. \nBorrower  and  sponsors.

The project is consistent with \n15. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  outlines  seven  operational  priorities  to  address  the  development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.4 The project supports two of those priorities: (i) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and \n(ii)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequality.  It  also  supports  Strategy  2030\u2019s \nobjectives to expand the role of private sector operations and mobilize additional resources on \ntop of ADB\u2019s own financing. \n \nThe energy sector has been a priority for ADB\u2019s Viet Nam country program. Since 1994, \n16. \nADB has provided 16 sovereign loans for a total of $2.6 billion, three nonsovereign loans for a \ntotal of $250 million, and 43 technical assistance projects and grants for a total of $37.6 million to \nthe energy sector. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020 aims to foster \ninclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  project  is  aligned  with  two  of  the  three \npillars of the strategy: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery and \n(ii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response. Under the strategy, ADB \nwill  increase  the  focus  on  renewable  energy,  including  through  public\u2013private  partnerships,  to \npromote  sustainable  growth.5 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  commitments  to  the \n\n4  ADB.  2018.

International  lenders  are  not  comfortable  offering  long-term  US  dollar-\ndenominated  debt  on  a  nonrecourse  basis  in  the  Vietnamese  market  because  of  concerns \nregarding the PPA and the nascency of the solar power sector. Local banks lack experience with \nproject finance and are unable to offer US dollar-denominated longer tenor debt for infrastructure \nprojects. As one of the first international limited-recourse project finance transactions in Viet Nam, \nthe  project  will  demonstrate  the  potential  for  private  sector  investment  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  nascent \nrenewable energy sector, send a strong signal to the market and attract other investors for similar \ninvestments. ADB has led the structuring of the transaction and is crowding in commercial banks \nunder the B loan structure. ADB will also offer a longer tenor than participating commercial banks, \nhelping  to  improve  debt  service  coverage  ratios  for  lenders  and  thereby  improve  the  financial \nviability of the project. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  this  project  will  demonstrate  that  innovative  financing  solutions  can \naddress existing challenges in this nascent market. The successful financing of this project will \nlower the risk perception of the industry and help set a project finance precedent for utility-scale \nsolar  power  in  Viet  Nam.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  and  due  diligence  will  ensure  that  the  project  is \ndeveloped and operated to international best practice standards and will perform to expectations \nover  the  project  life.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  will  also  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nrigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n22. \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).10 \n  \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n23. \nimpacts  of the  project  and  the measures to  avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans.
