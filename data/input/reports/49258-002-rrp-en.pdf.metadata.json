The Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Line 5 (Southern Route) will be constructed between Gabtoli \nand Dasherkandi stations with a length of about 17.4 kilometers (km). The PRF will prepare the \ndetailed feasibility study, engineering design, and procurement document; and provide assistance \nin procurement-related processes. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROJECT READINESS FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe economy of Bangladesh has grown rapidly at an annual average rate of 6.5% since \n2005.  With  the  transformation  of  the  country\u2019s  economic  structure  from  agriculture  oriented  to \nmore  value-adding  manufacturing  and  service  industries,  the  capital  city  of  Dhaka  plays  a \nsignificant  role  as  an  industrial  and  commercial  center.  Dhaka  contributes  nearly  40%  of  the \nnational  gross  domestic  product  and  attracts  migrants  from  other  regions  who  are  looking  for \nbetter business and employment opportunities. Dhaka\u2019s population was 15.9 million in 2011, and \nincreased at a rate of 3.9% from 2001 to 2011, well above the national growth rate of 1.4%.1 The \npopulation is projected to further increase to 26.3 million in 2035.2 \n \nTraffic  conditions  and  challenges  in  Dhaka.  Despite  its  fast-growing  population  and \n4. \ncorresponding traffic demand, Dhaka lacks an alternative mass transit network and relies heavily \non  road  transport.  Bangladesh  Railway,  the  only  railway  system  currently  available  in  Dhaka, \nprovides  two  commuter  service  lines\u2014between  Dhaka  and  Narayagonj,  and  Dhaka  and \nJoydevpur\u2014which carry a total of about 25,000 passengers per day.3 Almost all of the 15 million \ndaily  trips  generated  in  the  area  are  accommodated  by  road  transport.  An  estimated  47%  of \npassenger trips are made by buses and 14% by cars.4 The number of vehicles in Dhaka has been \nsteadily increasing. About 140,000 vehicles were newly registered in 2017, including about 20,000 \nprivate  cars.5 Traffic  volume  in  Dhaka  already  exceeds  the  road  capacity  by  20%  on  average \nduring peak hours, and by more than 100% on particular sections in the central areas, causing \nserious traffic congestion on major trunk roads.6 The average speed of travel by road is just 6.4 \nkm per hour during morning peak hours. The total economic loss caused by traffic congestion is \nestimated  at  about  7%  of  the  gross  domestic  product. 7  Without  further  transport  sector \n\n \n\n1  The  population  referred  to  here  is  that  of  the  area  under  the  Rajdhani  Unnnayan  Kartripakkha  (the  Capital \nDevelopment  Authority  of  Bangladesh),  which  includes  Dhaka  city  and  its  peripheral  areas  of  1,429  square \nkilometers. \n\n2  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Dhaka  Transport  Coordination  Authority.  2016.  Revised  Strategic  Transport  Plan. \n\nDhaka. \n\n3  The current railway system remains a minor traffic modality in Dhaka because of the (i) limited number of lines and \nstations, (ii) low frequency and timeliness of the commuter train services, (iii) low quality of railway facilities, and (iv) \ninconvenience of ticketing and intermodal functions. \n\n4  Other major road traffic modes are rickshaw (32%), compressed natural gas (CNG) auto rickshaw/three wheelers \n\n(9%), and motorcycle (3%). \n\n5  Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. 2018. Number of Registered Motor Vehicles in Dhaka. Dhaka. \n6  The  road  pavement  on  major  arterial  roads  in  urban  areas  is  in  relatively  good  condition.  However,  traffic \nmanagement  and  traffic  demand  control,  including  signaling  systems  and  intersection  management,  could  be \nimproved, and currently contribute to the severe traffic congestion at several intersections. \n\n7  S. Chakraborty. 2016. Traffic Congestion in Dhaka City and its Economic Impact. Journal of Business Studies Special \n\nInternational Edition 2016. University of Dhaka. pp. 45\u201368. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ninterventions in Dhaka, average peak hour travel speed is expected to further deteriorate to 4.5 \nkm per hour, with a traffic volume to road capacity ratio of 3.7 projected for 2035 (footnote 2). \n \n5. \nDhaka is the country\u2019s economic and commercial center, with high movement of people \nand goods. Higher incomes enable an increasing number of people to buy cars, while there is \nlimited potential to construct new or widen existing roads in the central areas of Dhaka without \nlarge-scale land acquisition and resettlement. Consequently, the government needs to provide \nefficient, high-quality public transport to reduce the traffic burden on the existing road network and \nshift traffic from private vehicles and low-capacity public buses.  \n \n6. \nGovernment  urban  transport  strategy.  The  transport  sector  strategic  priority  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan is timely completion of critical transport links to improve \nconnectivity. 8  A  top  priority  in  urban  transport  is  to  lower  road  network  congestion  through \nappropriate  investment  and  transport  management,  including  mass  rapid  transit  (MRT) \ndevelopment. In this context, the government formulated the Revised Strategic Transport Plan \n(RSTP)  in  2016  as  an  urban  transport  master  plan  for  Dhaka  with  a  20-year  planning  horizon \nthrough support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).9 The RSTP intends to \nensure mobility and access to vital urban services by providing a safe, equitable transport system \nthat  uses  efficient  public  transport  modes.  Special  attention  is  given  to  the  development  of  a \nsustainable public transport system that is integrated with land use and urban development.10 \n \nThe RSTP estimates that 1.0 million\u20132.6 million trips will be generated per day in 2035 \n7. \nbetween  zones  in  central  Dhaka.11 The  generated  traffic  across  the  zones  will  concentrate  on \nlimited trunk roads that mainly run north and south. Only new public transport modalities can be \nimplemented along those trunk roads. Given this constraint, the master plan identifies six distinct \npublic  transport  corridors  with  high  passenger  traffic  demand  that  connect  Dhaka\u2019s  central \nbusiness  district  with  surrounding  satellite  regional  centers.  The  high  demand  along  these \ncorridors requires public transport capacity of 18,000\u201346,000 passengers per hour per direction \n(PPHPD), which will be effectively accommodated only by a high-capacity transit system.12 The \nRSTP  proposes  five  MRT  lines  and  two  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  lines  along  the  identified \ncorridors.13 An  efficient  transit  system  will  also  help  manage  expanding  urbanization  through \ntransit-oriented development and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. These MRTs and BRTs \nare scheduled to be completed by 2035. The government has an action plan to advance the target \nof completion of three priority MRT lines (1, 5, and 6) to 2030 at the latest. \n \n8. \nThe first ever MRT network development in Bangladesh, including underground sections \nin congested areas, requires government intervention to ensure financial viability, allocate risks, \n\n \n\n8  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission,  General  Economics  Division.  2015.  7th  Five-Year  Plan, \n\nFY2016\u2013 FY2020: Accelerating Growth, Empowering Citizens. Dhaka. \n\n9  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Dhaka  Transport  Coordination  Board.  2005.  Strategic  Transport  Plan  for  Dhaka. \nDhaka. The Strategic Transport Plan (STP) was prepared in 2005 in cooperation with the World Bank. The STP \nincludes the 20-year Urban Transportation Policy (2004\u20132024), which identifies priority issues such as improvement \nof  mass  transit systems  (bus and  rail  transportation), development  of  urban  expressways,  and establishment  of \ntransport institutions. \n\n10  The RSTP also proposed (i) a road network with three rings and eight radials to develop satellite regional centers \n\nand reduce through-traffic, and (ii) several short-term transport projects. \n\n11  The  RSTP  estimates  the  trips  per  day  in  2035:  2.6  million  between  South  Dhaka  and  West  Dhaka,  1.1  million \nbetween  West  Dhaka  and  Gulshan,  and  1.0  million  between  South  Dhaka  and  Gulshan.  Trips  between  central \nDhaka and surrounding areas of Gazipur will increase to 0.4 million\u20130.6 million. \n\n12  Among several public transport options, buses accommodate up to 3,000\u20134,000 PPHPD; light rail transit, 4,000\u2013\n15,000  PPHPD;  automated  guideway  transit,  8,000\u201320,000  PPHPD;  BRT  10,000\u201325,000  PPHPD;  and  MRT \n25,000\u201350,000  PPHPD.  Given  traffic  volume  and  growth  forecasts,  the  MRT  and  BRT  are  considered  the  best \noptions. \n\n13  The proposal comprises MRT Line 1 (52 km), MRT Line 2 (40 km), MRT Line 4 (16 km), MRT Line 5 (35 km), and \nMRT Line 6 (41 km); and BRT Line 3 (42 km) and BRT Line 7 (36 km). The STP proposed three MRTs and three \nBRTs. However, the RSTP reviewed the STP in terms of traffic demand and integration of urban development. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nand  develop  implementation  and  operations  standards.14 The  Dhaka  Mass  Transit  Company \nLimited (DMTCL) was established in 2013 as a state-owned company to construct, operate, and \nmaintain  the  MRT  system  in  Dhaka  and  surrounding  areas,  and  has  begun  preparing  and \nimplementing  the  priority  MRT  lines.  However,  establishing  a  high-capacity  and  quality  public \ntransport  system  requires  huge  financial  resources  and  operational  management  capacity. \nDevelopment partners have responded to government requests for assistance in preparing and \noperationalizing the system. In particular, JICA is supporting the construction of MRT Line 6 with \nhands-on  technical  cooperation  and  project  preparation  for  MRT  Line  1  and  Line  5  (Northern \nRoute). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing assistance for the construction of BRT \nLine  3  (North),  and  a  request  has  been  received  to  finance  MRT  Line  5  (Southern  Route).15 \nCurrently, the World Bank is assisting only BRT Line 3 (South). \n \n9. \nThe  planned  MRT  Line  5,  with  its  north  and  south  sections,  will  have  daily  boarding \npassengers  of  1,478,600  and  PPHPD  of  28,340  in  2035  (footnote  2).  Though  demand  is  less \ncompared to MRT Line 1 and Line 6 (which also runs north\u2013south), the government places a high \nvalue on Line 5 as an essential and priority MRT line to create an effective public transport network \nin Dhaka, serving one of the few east\u2013west corridors and providing intermodal stations with other \nMRT and BRT lines in the north\u2013south direction. The DMTCL\u2019s limited experience in implementing \na  complicated  mass  transit  system,  the  technical  and  traffic  management  challenges  of \nunderground construction in congested areas, and anticipated soft-ground conditions at a depot \nlocation require preparation of a complete, high-quality engineering design for Line 5 (Southern \nRoute) by leveraging international expertise with the assistance of ADB\u2019s PRF. \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. In line with the government\u2019s strategy, ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  aims  to  ease  infrastructure  constraints  by  undertaking \ntransformational  investments  in  key  sectors,  including  transport.16 ADB  places  a  high  value on \nassistance for urban transport capacity expansion and efficiency improvements. In addition to the \nongoing BRT Line 3 (North) project, ADB has supported a prefeasibility study of the proposed \nMRT Line 5 (Southern Route) under project preparation technical assistance.17 The prefeasibility \nstudy examined the traffic demand forecast, operational plan, preliminary alignment, locations of \nthe  stations  and  a  depot,  preliminary  equipment specifications,  preliminary  safeguard  surveys, \ncost  estimates,  and  economic  and  financial  analyses.  The  results  confirmed  the  project\u2019s  high \npriority  and  economic  viability.18 The  proposed  PRF  will  ensure  high  project  readiness  of  the \nlarge-scale  ensuing  MRT  Line  5  (Southern  Route)  project  and  mobilize  financing  resources \nrequired  for  the  project\u2019s  engineering  design.  The  proposed  PRF  is  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Bangladesh.19 \n \n11. \nThe  ensuing  project  will  align  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  under  Strategy  2030  by \nproviding (i) sustainable and climate-resilient urban transport with low levels of greenhouse gas \nemissions; (ii) an integrated approach for sustainable urban development through transit-oriented \n\n \n\n14  The first MRT of Line 6 is all elevated.

Measures  for  climate  and  natural  disaster  resilience  and \nfeatures for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities will be integrated into the \nengineering design. Technical compatibility with other metro lines, where relevant, will be secured \nin  the  design  specifications.  The  design  will  also  include  advanced  technology,  such  as  an \nautomated  ticketing  and  fare  collection  system  with  an  integrated  database  for  operations \nmanagement. The PRF will help prepare procurement documents and activities in line with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).

The  base  cost  of  the  ensuing  project  is  preliminarily \nestimated at $2.5 billion, and the indicative overall MFF amount will be determined over the course \nof project preparation, based on completed engineering design and identification of contingencies \nand potential cofinanciers. MRT Line 5 (Southern Route) will comprise a total length of about 17.4 \nkm between Gabtoli and Dasherkandi stations.23 The congested central area of Dhaka requires \n12.8 km of underground section with 12 stations, while the remaining section will be elevated with \nfour stations.24 The project will be connected to Line 5 (North) at Gabtoli station.

The  DMTCL  is \nmandated to establish, operate, and maintain the MRT system (including planning, survey, design, \ndevelopment, construction, and financing) in and around Dhaka city to meet the urban transport \nneeds of Dhaka and neighboring areas. \n \n23. \nThe proposed PRF will finance consulting services only and will not involve pilot-testing \nactivities;  therefore,  procurement  risk  is  considered  low.  A  financial  management  assessment \nwas  conducted  in  May  2019.  The  financial  management  risk  is  considered  moderate.  The \nassessment  showed  that,  despite  some  staffing  and  internal  audit  challenges,  the  executing \nagency  has  acceptable  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  including  procedures  for \nmaking payments, financial reporting, and auditing financial statements. Although this is DMTCL\u2019s \nfirst project with ADB, the agency has had experience in working with JICA and is familiar with \nsimilar procurement and financial management processes and standards. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nSince the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, activities have not been \ncategorized  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).27 Safeguard  classifications  for  the \nensuing project are expected to be category A for both environment and involuntary resettlement. \nNo adverse impacts from the ensuing project are expected for tribes, minor races, ethnic sects \nand  communities.28 The  PRF  will  finance  preparation  of  the  necessary  safeguard  documents \nbased on the surveys and engineering design. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n25. \nThe  government  and  the  DMTCL  have  assured  ADB  that  PRF  implementation  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n26. \nI am satisfied that the proposed project readiness financing loan would comply with the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $33,260,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Dhaka  Mass \nRapid Transit Development Project Readiness Financing (Line 5, Southern Route), from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per \nyear during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n6 November 2019 \n\n \n\n26 Integrity due diligence conducted in May 2019 found no negative information on the DMTCL and its personnel. \n27 ADB. 2009.
