THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Infrastructure Preparation \nand Innovation Facility. \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  meet  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment objectives by supporting the preparation of and management capacity for national \npublic infrastructure projects by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the \nDepartment of Transportation (DOTr). The project will improve readiness and quality of public \ninfrastructure projects, and strengthen the public investment management systems. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Accelerating  infrastructure  investment.  In  line  with  the  Ten-Point  Socioeconomic \nAgenda, the government aims to ramp up public infrastructure projects such as national roads, \nexpressways, bridges, airports, subways, and railways.1 Public spending on infrastructure is \nexpected to reach 7% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2022, or approximately $14.5 billion \nannually, from 3.4% of GDP in 2016. To realize the goals of infrastructure investment, the \ngovernment requested the proposed project from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which will \nhelp the two key agencies responsible for national public infrastructure projects\u2014DPWH and \nDOTr\u2014conduct pre-investment activities. These will, in turn, help accelerate the Investment \nCoordination  Committee\u2019s  review  and  approval  process  and  ensure  timely,  high-quality \nprocurement and implementation.2 \n \n4.  Core development problem. Infrastructure enables access to work, markets, education, \nhealth care, housing, and other services that allow people to uplift their standards of living. Lack \nof or underdeveloped infrastructure has been identified as one of the most significant constraints \non the Philippines\u2019 growth prospects. While the country has improved consistently in the Global \nCompetitiveness Ranking, from 65th in 2012\u20132013 to 57th in 2016\u20132017, its overall infrastructure \nsignificantly lags that of other emerging Southeast Asian countries. In 2016\u20132017, the Philippines \nwas ranked 112th out of 138 countries on infrastructure quality, well below other Southeast Asian \ncountries  such  as  Malaysia  (19th), Thailand  (72nd),  and  Indonesia  (80th). The  impacts  of \nunderdeveloped public infrastructure are high costs of doing business, which in turn undermine \nbusiness potential and economic opportunities, especially in rapidly growing urban areas. The \nPhilippines has to step up infrastructure development substantially if it wants to realize its potential \nand remain competitive. \n \n5.  Infrastructure development constraints. Underdeveloped infrastructure is attributed to \nfive  factors:  (i)  insufficient  infrastructure  investment,  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination, \n(iii) inadequate or incomplete infrastructure plans and implementation programs, (iv) limited \naccess to international expertise and limited technical and management know-how in project \npreparation and implementation, and (v) inadequate sustainability of infrastructure. Coordination \nbetween DPWH and DOTr and with other key agencies is limited, which constrains project \n                                                \n1  The Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, as presented during the Sulong: Hakbang Tungo sa Kaunlaran consultative \nworkshop held on 20\u201321 June 2016. \n2  The government\u2019s official request for ADB\u2019s assistance was made on 8 February 2017. \n \n ", "2 \npreparation  and  implementation.  Infrastructure  projects  are  often  not  delivered  as  planned \nbecause  of  dated  project  formulation  or  dated  project  implementation,  or  both.3 Delays  in \nsafeguard  compliance,  procurement,  and  land  acquisition,  as  well  as  inadequate  project \nmanagement systems prevent timely project delivery. The lack of project management and \nmonitoring systems also means that infrastructure is often delayed, inefficiently operated, and \ninadequately maintained, which undermines the sustainability of project benefits. \n \n6.  Tackling  constraints  on  infrastructure  planning,  design,  and  implementation. \nStepping up national capacity begins with gaining better access to international sources of \ninnovation, expertise, advice, and best practices, which would enable DPWH and DOTr to \nincorporate expertise and innovation in project formulation and implementation. An ADB-funded \nproject and its international procurement systems would make it easier for DPWH and DOTr to \naccess the required technologies, international expertise, and innovation to complement and build \non nationally available know-how. The proposed loan will help DPWH and DOTr to execute and \nimplement public infrastructure projects more effectively by accelerating the due diligence stages, \ndetailed engineering designs, and bidding process preparations. \n \n7.  A medium-term solution. The project offers a short- to medium-term solution to the near-\nterm needs of DPWH and DOTr to boost their capacity for  preparing public infrastructure \ninvestments. ADB has previously assisted government efforts to tackle the country\u2019s infrastructure \nconstraints with various project loans. The proposed project will supplement these interventions \nby providing DPWH and DOTr with access to international expertise and best practices that are \nnot currently available under locally funded development activities. They will allow the government \nto act on its Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda to support the increase in spending on public \nsector infrastructure. In addition, the project will provide support for the preparation of the long-\nterm solution to the problem by (i) building the capacity of government agencies to effectively \nplan, identify, design, manage, and implement projects; and (ii) set the groundwork for a holistic \nexamination of the current national procurement system and develop options for additional \nefficiency in its implementation. A separate TA grant for Strengthening Infrastructure Capacity \nand  Innovation  for  Inclusive  Growth  was  provided  to  support  key  agencies  involved  in \ninfrastructure development\u2014National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), DPWH, and \nDOTr\u2014in the short-to-medium term.4 \n \n8.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. The project is included in the country operations \nand business plan for the Philippines, 2017\u20132019.5 It contributes to the agenda of inclusive \neconomic and environmentally sustainable growth of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.6 \n \n9.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  will  build  upon  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience supporting the Public\u2013Private Partnership Center for the Philippines and enhance the \ngovernment public sector agencies\u2019 institutional set-up and capacity to identify, finance, and \nimplement public-financed projects. The project will also be supported by the separate TA grant \nwhich will develop a public infrastructure project system management procedure and strengthen \ncapacity of DPWH and DOTr staff to effectively implement and monitor projects. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008.

The ADB assistance will provide value addition in the direct support to DPWH and DOTr \nin delivering more effective and innovative infrastructure projects through: (i) enhanced effectivity \nof identification, analysis, and planning for infrastructure gaps using international best practices, \nespecially roads, urban transport, urban water, sanitation, and flood management; (ii) addressing \ncritical  constraints  such  as  resettlement  processes  and  inadequate  access  to  international \nknowledge, best practices, innovation, and technology; and (iii) implementation management of \nsophisticated public infrastructure projects with international expertise to supplement national \nexpertise and resources. The project will also help define key operational areas for ADB through \ngap analysis and support for country system development in key areas such as (i) land acquisition; \n(ii) procurement; and (iii) start-up delays.7 A TA loan is proposed as the financing modality. \n \nB.
