Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by a record 34.5% in \nreal terms in 2006, the highest growth rate in the world for the second year in a row. By far, the \nlargest engine of growth has been industry, specifically the oil and gas sector, which increased \n56% in 2006 and grew cumulatively by 150% during 2005\u20132006. The non-oil economy also has \nexpanded,  rising  12%  in  2006.  However,  its  contribution  to  GDP  has  fallen  over  the  past  few \nyears as the oil sector has grown. The non-oil sector was 47% of nominal GDP in 2006, down \nfrom 58% in 2005 and 61% in 2004. Rising oil prices and export volumes have contributed to \nAzerbaijan's significantly strengthened external position.1 \n \n3. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  for  the  Azerbaijan  economy  is  positive.  GDP  is  expected  to \npost double-digit growth for the next few years, in line with the increases in oil and gas exports. \nHowever,  foreign  investment  is  projected  to  decrease  as  the  major  oil  and  gas  projects  move \ntowards  less  intensive  stages.  Domestic  public  investment  is  expected  to  partially  offset  the \ndecline in foreign investment. Government expenditures, which rose by more than 80% in 2006, \nare  projected  to  rise  by  an  additional  50%  in  2007.  In  part  due  to  the  increase  in government \nspending, as well as the continued strong foreign exchange inflows associated with the oil and \ngas sector and robust private consumption, inflationary pressure will increase. Annual inflation is \nexpected to accelerate from 11.4% in 2006 to more than 15.0% in 2007.2\n \n4. \nIn February 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded Azerbaijan's foreign and local currency issuer \ndefault ratings to BB+ from BB. Fitch Ratings also noted the country\u2019s outlooks remain stable. \nThe upgrade of Azerbaijan's sovereign ratings was driven by strong and sustainable economic \ngrowth,  low  government  and  external  debt  ratios,  and  a  growing  current  account  surplus, \nunderpinned by rapidly rising oil and gas production. In addition, in September 2006, Moody's \nInvestors Service assigned a foreign and local currency issuer rating of Ba1 to Azerbaijan. \n \nB. \n\nChallenges of the Future \n\n5. \nIn the long term, Azerbaijan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to \nthe economy, given the potential volatility in the international oil market. The main challenge for \nAzerbaijan  is  to  develop  the  non-oil  sector  to  ensure  the  sustainable  growth  of  the  economy \ncontinues after the oil boom, meeting short-term expectations and longer-term demands. A key \nobjective  is  to  develop  income-generating  and  new  employment  opportunities  in  the  non-oil \n\n                                                 \n1  In 2006, Azerbaijan had a current account surplus of $3.7 billion, equivalent to 18.7% of GDP. This  was a sharp \n\nreversal from the current account deficit of 30% of GDP recorded in 2004. \n\n2  As a result of the substantial  increase in public spending  and rapid demand  growth, the inflation rate for the first \n\nquarter of 2007 was 16.6%. \n\n\f 2 \n\nsector,  in  such  priority  areas  as  banking  and  finance,  trade,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs).  \n \nC. \n\nBanking Sector in Azerbaijan  \n\n1. \n\nOverview  \n\n6. \nKey  performance  indicators  for  the  Azeri  banking  system  have  improved  significantly \nsince 2000, mainly due to strong growth in the economy and financial sector reform. However, it \nis  still  considered  one  of  the  weakest  banking  systems  among  the  sovereigns  rated  by  Fitch \nRatings.3 Despite recent progress, the financial system remains small and highly concentrated. \nAt  the  beginning  of  2007,  the  banking  system  consisted  of  44  commercial  banks  operating \nunder  license  of  the  National  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (NBA),  with  total  statutory  capital  of  $693 \nmillion4 (Figure 1). \n \n7. \nThe Azeri banking sector is almost fully privatized. The last remaining 100% state-owned \nbank  (Kapital  Bank)  is  expected  to  be  privatized  in  the  near  future.  The  private  banks  of  the \ncountry are still relatively small, with total assets of $30 million\u2013$80 million and equity of about \n$10 million  for  a  typical  top  tier  private  bank.  Individuals  or  private  business  groups  generally \nown  the  leading  private  banks,  with  state-owned  enterprises  holding  small  stakes\u2014if  any.  In \nrecent  years,  a  top  tier  of  about  10  private  banks  has  emerged,  representing  half  of  the  total \nbank capital in the country. The remaining banks are small players with low levels of total assets. \nThe banking sector is expected to consolidate in the medium term, especially since the NBA is \nincreasing  the  minimum  required  capital.  Major  international  banks  do  not  have  substantial \noperations in Azerbaijan, mainly because of the small size of the domestic market and certain \nlegal restrictions.  \n \n8. \nWhile the authorities continue to improve prudential regulations, significant vulnerabilities \nin the banking system remain. In response to rising credit and foreign exchange risks, NBA has \ntightened  the  prudential  rules  on  loan  collateral  and  open  positions  in  foreign  currencies,  and \nhas increased the minimum capital requirement. \n \nThe  Heritage  Foundation  Banking  Index  rating  of  3.5  (on  a  scale  of  1\u20135)  shows  a \n9. \nrelatively  restrictive  environment  for  banks,  which  is  reflected  in  the  absence  of  any  major \ninternational bank operating in the country. However, this result is similar to the average index \nscore of 3.73 for Asian Development Fund (ADF) borrowing countries. \n\n                                                 \n3  Fitch Ratings. 2007.

The  provision  of  financial  services  to  households  and  the \nprivate  sector  is  very  limited.  Only  an  estimated  10%  of  the  population  has  bank  accounts, \nreflecting low confidence in the banking sector. Financial services have been provided mainly to \nthe oil, construction, and trade sectors, leaving retail clients and SMEs notably underserved. \n \n11. \nThe banking system\u2019s assets, the pillar of the Azerbaijan financial system, represented \nonly 21% of GDP in 2006, significantly below the ratios for the Russian Federation (53%) and \nKazakhstan (91%). At the end of 2006, the volume of assets grew by almost 60% and totaled \n$4,344 million. The most significant element in the structure of bank assets are loans issued to \ncustomers, which totaled $2,537 million (58.4% of total assets). State-owned IBA holds half of \nthe country\u2019s banking assets (Figure 2).  \n \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Share of Banks\u2019 Assets \n(as of 1 January 2007) \n\n22%\n\n2%\n\n2%\n2%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n4%\n\n4%\n\n52%\n\nIBA\n\nBank Standard\n\nKapital\n\nUnibank\n\nTexnikabank\n\nAzerigazbank\n\nRespublika\n\nBank of Baku\n\nKochbank\n\nAzerdemiryolbank\n\nOther\n\n \n\nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n\n \n \n \n12. \nThe  most  significant  component  of  banking  sector  liabilities  are  deposits  issued  to \ncorporate  and  individual  customers,  which  totaled  $2,253  million  (64.23%  of  total  liabilities). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nBanking  sector  deposits  have  grown  rapidly  but  remain  low,  and  not  commensurate  with \nAzerbaijan\u2019s level of development. NBA reported that deposits rose by 50% in 2006 to AZN2.0 \nbillion, an estimated 11% of GDP.  \n \nDollarization  of  the  economy  remains  high,  with  more  than  50%  of  savings  held  in \n13. \nforeign  currency  at  the  end  of  2006,  and  53%  of  the  lending  volume  in  foreign  currency. \nHowever, the share of deposits held in Azerbaijan new manats has increased notably over the \npast year, at least in part because of the appreciation of the local currency against the US dollar. \nBy November 2006, 37% of deposits were held, up from 20% at the end of 2005. \n \n14. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  commercial  banks  have  used  the  rapidly  growing  deposit  base  to  expand \ntheir  loan  portfolios,  an  important  and  positive  development  given  the  marginal  financial \nintermediation role that they have played in the economy. As of December 2006, consolidated \nlending by banks was AZN2.36 billion, an increase of 64% from the previous year. By April 2007, \nconsolidated  lending  by  banks  reached  AZN2.87  billion.  Despite  the  large  increase  in  the \ndeposit  base,  it  is  still  too  small  to  meet  the growing  demand  for  financial  services,  especially \nfrom SMEs.  \n \n15. \nPrivate  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  each  provide  about  48%  of  total  loans \noutstanding, with the remainder coming from nonbank institutions. However, most private banks \nfocus exclusively on lending to the private sector, primarily individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. \nBecause  of  their  small  size  and  customer  focus,  these  banks  provide  mainly  small  and  micro \nloans, and typically do not serve the oil and gas sector. \n \n\nFigure 3: Share of Banks\u2019 Loans \n(as of 1 January 2007) \n\n25%\n\n2%\n2%\n2%\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n4%\n\nIBA\n\nTexnikabank\n\nUnibank\n\nKapital\n\nBank Standard\n\n50%\n\nAzerigazbank\n\nRespublika\n\nBank of Baku\n\nAzerdemiryolbank\n\nTurnabank\n\nOther\n\n \n\nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n\n \n \n16. \nThe  share  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPL)  and  the  level  of  capital  at  risk  are  moderate. \nAccording  to  national  statistics,  the  share  of  NPLs  in  2006  was  low  at  3.33%,  compared  with \n4.73%  in  previous  year.  However,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development\u2019s \nTransition  Report  20065  noted  that  level  of  NPLs  in  the  entire  banking  system  was  14.9%  in \n2005, 0.4% higher than 2004. The ratio and quality of capitalization in the banking system is a \nconcern, particularly as credit continues to grow rapidly. In response to this issue, the authorities \nhave worked to improve the supervision of the banking system. Minimum capital requirements \n\n                                                 \n5 EBRD.

London. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nwill  be  raised  from  AZN8.2  million  to  AZN10.0  million  by  July  2008,  which  is  expected  to \ntranslate into further consolidation and mergers resulting in fewer and better-capitalized banks. \nThis  is  a  positive  step  towards  strengthening  the  financial  system.  Currently,  only  10  of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s 44 banks have AZN10.0 million in capital.  \n \n17. \nThe financial condition of Azeri banks remains stable, while displaying positive dynamics. \nBased on 2006 data, the average return on equity of Azeri banks was about 30% and the return \non assets was 2%. As oil prices remain high and new investments flow into Azerbaijan, interest \nrates  are  expected  to  decrease.  As  interest  rates  decrease  and  the  economy  grows,  the \nbanking sector almost certainly will expand. Moreover, as the domestic economy is growing at \n10%  a  year  in  real  terms,  investment  opportunities  will  increase  in  areas  such  as  hotels  and \ntourism, retail, catering, and real estate. Oil construction also stimulates related sectors, such as \ntransportation, engineering, and the steel industry. Even without any structural improvement, the \nbanking  sector  might  show  good  growth,  comparable  to  GDP  expansion.  However,  structural \nimprovement  might  give  a  much  more  significant  boost  to  the  banking  sector.  The  pace  of \ngrowth will be determined by the success of structural reforms. Appendix 1 provides a historical \noverview of the development of the Azeri banking sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutlook \n\nDespite  substantial  multilateral  and  bilateral  support  to  banks,  most  private  banks  are \n18. \nexpected  to  remain  illiquid  and  undercapitalized  in  the  medium  term.  State-owned  banks  will \ncontinue to dominate the sector, which\u2014together with continued strong economic growth\u2014will \nhelp  keep  the  risk  of  a  banking  crisis  low.  Structural  changes  in  the  banking  sector  will  foster \nfurther  consolidation  and  greater  foreign  participation.  The  new  banking  system  and  central \nbank  laws  have  significantly  strengthened  banking  sector  legislation.  Authorities  are  confident \nthat  this  will  provide  the  basis  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  financial  sector  in  Azerbaijan, \nparticularly given the strengthening of the supervisory framework. Furthermore, the Government \nis  developing  banking  infrastructure  to  make  it  better  suited  to  channeling  savings  into  the \neconomy. The Government and the NBA have issued prudential regulations conforming to best \ninternational  practices, \nloan-loss  provisioning,  and  asset \nclassification regulations. Details are in Appendix 2. \n \nD. \n\n \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Azerbaijan \n\nincluding  risk-based  capital, \n\n1. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n19. \nBetween  1995  and  2006,  the  privatization  of  state-owned  property  and  the  creation  of \nnew businesses have contributed greatly to the development of the private sector in Azerbaijan. \nAt the beginning of 2007, the country had 74,354 registered legal entities, of which 80.6% were \nprivate enterprises. At present, 4,161 foreign legal entities are registered in Azerbaijan. \n \n20. \nIn 2006, the private sector accounted for about 81% of GDP. Private firms are the major \nsource  of  employment  and  government  budget  revenues.  The  share  of  the  nongovernment \nsector  in  the  manufacturing  and  service  areas,  such  as  agriculture,  industry,  trade,  hotels, \ncatering services, civic construction, and transport and communication, is 70%\u201395%. \n \n\n2. \n\nConstitution of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n\n21. \nThe  development  of  SMEs  is  crucial  to  the  development  of  the  non-oil  sector  in \nAzerbaijan.  Because  of  structural  reforms  and  improvements  in  legislation  and  taxation,  the \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nnumber  of  entrepreneurs  increased  considerably  over  the  past  10  years.  In  2006,  243,473 \npeople were registered as individual entrepreneurs. Most of them are involved in trade (49.4%); \ntransport,  storage,  and  telecommunications  (17.9%);  agriculture  (9.5%);  public  and  social \nservices  (8.2%);  and  real  estate  (5.9%).  SMEs  account  for  about  80%  of  registered  private \nbusinesses operating in Azerbaijan, and have generated on average an estimated 10% of GDP \nover  the  past  5  years.  SMEs  are  the  largest  source  of  domestic  employment  outside  of  the \npublic  sector,  providing  livelihood  for  more  than  three  quarters  of  the  country\u2019s  workforce.  An \nestimated 70% of SMEs are in Baku and the Absheron Peninsula, and have limited capacity for \nregional expansion.  \n \n22. \nThe  importance  of  SMEs  to  general  economic  vitality  is  widely  acknowledged.  Studies \nhave shown that, in most countries, SMEs and the informal sector account for about 45%\u201375% \nof employment and 65%\u201370% of GDP, regardless of the development stage of the economy.6 \nThis is true for Azerbaijan as well.  \n \n23. \nStill,  further  efforts  are  needed  to  develop  SMEs.  One  of  the  biggest  hurdles  facing \nSMEs  in  Azerbaijan  today  is  the  lack  of  access  to  finance.  The  Government  and  the \ndevelopment  community  have  identified  and  recognized  this  problem  as  a  key  constraint  to \nSME development. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Efforts \n\n24. \nThe  Government  continues  to  support  SME  growth  and  improve  the  business \nenvironment. In the past 2 years, the state policy has shifted from providing direct aid to SMEs \nto  improving  the  regulatory  and  business  infrastructure  to  facilitate  the  development  of  the \nprivate sector. In consultation with the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business team, the Government has \nidentified a list of urgent measures and actions to simplify business regulations in the country.  \n \nIn  2005,  the  Government  completed  the  2-year  state  program  for  SME  development. \n25. \nThe  major  objectives  of  the  program  were  (i)  creation  and  development  of  legal  and  physical \ninfrastructure for efficient operation of SMEs, (ii) expansion of foreign economic activity of SMEs \nand  export  promotion,  and  (iii)  expansion  of  opportunities  for  financial  and  investment \nassistance for SMEs.  \n \n26. \nTo  help  alleviate  SMEs\u2019  lack  of  financing,  the  Government  established  a  special  state \nbudget fund for SME development, supervised by the Ministry of Economic Development. The \nfund  is expected  to  disburse  $94 million  in  2007  for  various  SME  projects  via  25  private  bank \nagents, one nonbank institution, and five credit unions. While the loan size varies from $50,000 \nto  $1  million,  the  annual  interest  rate  is  limited  to  7%  (market  rates  are  15%\u201320%).  However, \nthe ministry recognizes that the fund should not be a continuing source of subsidized financing \nfor SMEs, and that private banks have to step in. Private banks are asked to look for external \nsources  to  reduce  market  lending  rates.  The  ministry  is  expected  to  revise  the  charter  of  the \nfund  in  accordance  with  a  new  draft  of  the  second  state  program  on  SME  development  to  be \napproved  in  early  2008.  Further,  the  President  issued  a  special  decree  in  May  2007  aimed  at \naccelerating  SME  development  in  Azerbaijan.  According  to  the  decree,  development  of \nentrepreneurship  requires  new  measures  to  reduce  impediments,  such  as  time-consuming \nregistration procedures and licensing, etc. The cabinet of ministers and other line agencies have \n\n                                                 \n6   Corporation for Enterprise Development. 2004.

In  1991,  IBA  was  incorporated  as  a  fully  state-owned  bank.  In  1992,  IBA \nwas  transformed  into  a  joint-stock  commercial  bank,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  became  the \nmajor  shareholder  of  the  bank.  At  the  end  of  2006,  IBA  was  the  largest  bank  in  Azerbaijan, \naccounting for almost half of the total assets and loans in the banking sector, and more than half \nof the total deposits. It is also the largest bank in the South Caucasus in terms of asset scope, \ncustomer base, international banking relations, and number of products and services provided \nto customers. \n \n28. \nCorporate  banking  traditionally  has  been  IBA\u2019s  core  business.  IBA  collaborates  with \ncompanies  across  various  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  air  transportation,  oil  and  gas, \nelectricity, telecommunications, construction, food, tourism, and trade. Most of IBA\u2019s customers \nhave international operations. Transactions with large corporations constitute the bulk of IBA\u2019s \nrevenues from commercial banking, as well as a large portion of the bank\u2019s assets and liabilities. \nHowever,  in  the  3\u20134  years,  IBA  has  been  developing  its  SME  and  retail  banking  operations, \nalong with its as well institutional and investment banking. Appendix 3 provides more details on \nIBA\u2019s business activities. \n \n29. \nIBA\u2019s  head  office  is  in Baku.  IBA  has  36  branches  and  more  than  100  subbranches  in \nAzerbaijan, a subsidiary bank in Moscow (Russian Federation) with branches in three regions of \nthe  country,  a  subsidiary  bank  in  Tbilisi  (Georgia),  and  representative  offices  in  London  and \nFrankfurt.  At  the  beginning  of  2007,  IBA's  infrastructure  comprised  525  automated  teller \nmachines (ATM), 1,180 point of sale (POS) terminals, and 100 payment-information kiosks.  \n \n30. \nIBA's  customer  base,  which  consists  of  more  than  30,600  corporate  and  more  than \n412,000 individual customers, is served by 1,318 employees. The majority of corporate entities \nregistered in Azerbaijan are clients of IBA. Almost all large and medium companies operating in \nAzerbaijan are clients of IBA, as are many smaller companies. \n \n31. \n1 shows IBA\u2019s foreign currency ratings. \n\nIBA is rated by two rating agencies: Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Table \n\n \nTable 1: International Bank of Azerbaijan Credit Ratings \n\n \n\nLong term \nShort term \nOutlook \nSources: Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s Investors Service (September 2007). \n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service \nBa2 \nNP \nStable \n\nFitch Ratings \nBB+ \nB \nStable \n\n \nIn September 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded IBA\u2019s credit rating from BB to BB+ based on \n32. \nits  (i)  growing  importance  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  banking  system,  which  implies  the  highest  support \nfrom  the  government  if  needed;  (ii)  track  record  of  ongoing  support  from  the  state  in  terms  of \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nexternal  capital  contributions  and  regulatory  forbearance;  and  (iii)  potential  growth  in  its \ndominant and expanding domestic franchise. \n \n33. \nThe achievements of IBA have been recognized by esteemed international institutes and \npublications,  such  as  Euromoney  magazine  (Best  Bank  of  Azerbaijan),  The  Banker  magazine \n(Bank  of  the  Year  in  Azerbaijan),  Global  Finance  (Best  Emerging  Market  Bank  in  the  Central \nCaucasus  region),  Geneva  Higher  Institute  of  Business  and  Management,  and  Switzerland \nBusiness-Club  (Golden  Medallion  award).  In  2006,  Global  Finance  magazine  included  IBA  in \nthe list of the top 16 banks in Asian region.  \n\nB. \n\nNetwork \n\nAs of December 2006, IBA had the largest national coverage with 36 branches and more \n34. \nthan 100 subbranches in the country. In line with IBA\u2019s regional expansion strategy to promote \nretail and SME banking, which remain substantially underbanked in Azerbaijan, new branches \nwill be established in regional areas (outside of Baku) in the near future. Apart from those local \nbranches, IBA has representative offices in London and in Frankfurt, as well as two subsidiaries \nestablished in Moscow (Russian Federation) and in Tbilisi (Georgia).  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  be  a  subordinated  loan  of  up  to  $40.0  million  to  serve  as  tier  2 \n\n35. \ncapital for IBA.7 The proposed loan is expected to have a term of up to 10 years.  \n \n36. \nThe proposed loan will enable IBA to diversify and improve its capital structure, enabling \nthe  bank  to  expand  its  lending  to  SMEs  and  retail  businesses,  while  meeting  NBA\u2019s  capital \nadequacy ratio requirements.  \n \nB. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n37. \nNBA  has  prescribed  prudential  guidelines  for  a  commercial  bank\u2019s  issuance  of  tier  2 \ncapital.  The  major  restrictions  are  no  security,  and  subordination  to  the  claims  of  depositors. \nFurthermore, NBA requires that subordinated debt instruments, such as the proposed loan, not \nexceed 50% of tier 1 capital. These instruments, together with other components of tier 2 capital, \ncannot exceed 100% of tier 1 capital. \n \n38. \nThe proposed loan will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will carry \nan interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate plus a margin determined by ADB's \nPricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. The committee also will determine the upfront and \ncommitment fees.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for ADB Investment \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\nThe proposed loan will promote development at the following key levels: \n\n39. \n                                                 \n7  Tier  2  capital  is  used  to  supplement  the  bank\u2019s  tier  1  capital  or  core  capital  in  the  computation  of  the  capital \n\nadequacy ratio.   \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n9\n\nStrengthen  banking  sector. The weakness of the banking sector hampers the \ndevelopment of the economy, particularly the non-oil sector.  IBA is important to \nthe Azerbaijan economy; it plays a critical role in supporting the development and \nimplementation of key private and public projects and its relative standing in the \ndomestic  banking  sector  makes  it  essential  to  the  proper  functioning  of  the \nbanking  sector  in  the  country.  Effectively,  the  financial  health  of  IBA  is  a  key \nmeasure of the health of the banking sector as a whole. The increased financial \nstrength  of  IBA  represents  an  important  development  factor  for  the  national \nbanking industry and the national economy in general and fosters its integration \ninto the world economy.   \n\nThe level of confidence of the general public in the country\u2019s banking system is \nextremely low due largely to the Soviet legacy. Depositors fear that in case of a \nbank failure, they would not get their money back. Only an estimated 10% of the \ntotal population maintains bank accounts. The proposed loan will help strengthen \nthe banking sector at a critical point in its development and enhance confidence \nin the county\u2019s banking system. It would also help promote long-term consumer \ndeposits which would reduce the risk of mismatch of maturities.  \n \nSupport the privatization of IBA.  The provision of Tier 2 capital will strengthen \nIBA\u2019s capital base which is necessary for IBA to sustain and grow its operations, \nand allow IBA to meet regulatory capitalization requirements.  Such development \nwill  provide  increased  confidence  on  the  part  of  depositors,  creditors  and \npotential investors alike and thus, directly supports the Azerbaijan Government\u2019s \nefforts  to  privatize  IBA.  The  privatization  of  IBA  is  mandated  by  a  2005 \npresidential  decree  which  requires  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan  to  gradually \nreduce its share in IBA\u2019s charter capital either by selling its existing shares or by \nissuing additional shares on the open market, including on international financial \nmarkets.  The Government is targeting a privatization within the next two years.  \nIn  September  2007,  Kapital  Bank,  the  second  largest  state  owned  bank  in  the \ncountry,  was  privatized\u2014the  Azerbaijan  Government\u2019s  stake  in  Kapital  Bank  is \nnow down to 50% from the previous 100%. The privatization of the state owned \nbanks,  which  provide  banking  services  for  most  institutions  and  the  majority  of \nthe  country\u2019s  large,  state-owned  enterprises,  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  the \ndevelopment  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  private  commercial  banks,  as  the  competition  for \nbanking  services  will  be  on  a  more  level  playing  field.    As  such,  IBA\u2019s \ntransformation into a full fledged market player will further enhance the country\u2019s \nbanking  sector  in  the  long-term,  and  sends  a  clear  signal  of  the  Government\u2019s \nintention to implement financial and banking reforms. \n \nin  the  non-oil  sector.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  is \nPromote  development \ndominated  by  the  oil  sector  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture. In the absence of further oil discoveries, the country\u2019s oil wealth is set to \npeak  relatively  early.  As  such,  the  diversification  of  the  economic  base  will \nbecome  an  increasingly  important  means  to  sustaining  growth  and  will  reduce \nthe country\u2019s vulnerability to a sustained fall in oil prices.  The proposed loan will  \nallow  IBA  to  provide  increased  funding  to  SMEs  and  retail  clients  who  are \npresently underbanked, which in turn will support the creation of employment and \nlivelihood opportunities for a broader portion of the population, outside the oil and \ngas sector.    \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n(iv) \n\nProvide a template for other banks to raise subordinated debt. In a country \nwith  a  rapidly  developing  economy  and  a  fast  growing  banking  sector  such  as \nAzerbaijan,  there  is  inevitable  pressure  on  banks\u2019  capital  adequacy.  Access  to \nsubordinated debt, which counts as tier 2 capital, is key to addressing this issue. \nBanks  make  use  of  subordinated  debt  as  a  capital  instrument\u2014i.e.,  to  achieve \ntheir regulatory capital requirements. This is a common practice worldwide and is \nprevalent even in relatively unsophisticated markets. Such structure could serve \nas  a  benchmark  and  be  replicated  by  other  Azerbaijan  banks  following  the  IBA \ntier 2 capital management model.   \n\n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by the Asian Development Bank \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  allow  IBA  to  strengthen  its  capital  base.  This,  in  turn,  will \n40. \nenhance the bank\u2019s ability to expand its lending, particularly to SMEs and retail clients, providing \ngreater  financing  intermediation  in  Azerbaijan.  The  strengthening  of  IBA\u2019s  capital  base  also \nwould increase in investor confidence in IBA and expand the pool of potential investors, which \nwill be particularly important to the successful privatization of IBA in the future. The loan also will \nsupport  the  development  and  growth  of  a  sustainable  banking  sector  by  introducing  the  tier  2 \ncapital model. ADB will play a highly catalytic and demonstrative role, and will encourage other \nfinancial institutions to enter the market for this type of instrument, as banks in Azerbaijan are \nseverely undercapitalized.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\nADB has prepared a design and monitoring framework (Appendix 16) and will measure \n41. \nthe  expected  development  impact  of  the  loan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance \nManagement System.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFit to Country and Sector Strategy \n\n42. \nIn response to ADB\u2019s initiating paper for the country partnership strategy for Azerbaijan, \nthe  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  focus  on  four  priority  areas:  transport,  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  renewable  energy,  and  private  sector  development.8  Private  sector  development  is \nan integral component of the Government\u2019s sustainable development strategy, which is also an \nimportant thematic priority for ADB. Support for private sector development, therefore, is a key \nfocus area in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program updates (CSPU) and the interim operational \nstrategy for Azerbaijan.9  \n \n43. \nADB  has  the  opportunity  to  play  a  significant  role  in  private  sector  development  in \nAzerbaijan.  A  number  of  possibilities  for  private  sector  operations  in  activities  could  serve  as \nimportant  demonstration  projects  with  a  catalytic  effect  on  regional  economic  development.  A \nkey  to  private  sector  development  is  the  deepening  of  financial  intermediation,  especially  to \nSMEs. SMEs typically generate the most new jobs; introduce locally (and sometimes globally) \nrelevant innovations, products, and business methods; and can push economic reform and the \nmodernization of uncompetitive economies. Thus, SME development is an essential component \nof  pro-poor  growth  strategies,  and  is  an  important  focus  for  ADB  and  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral development institutions. \n\n                                                 \n8 Letter to ADB from the Ministry of Economic Development, dated 27 October 2006. \n9  Five  CSPUs  have  been  prepared  to  better  reflect  the  changing  needs  and  development  priorities  of  Azerbaijan: \n\nCSPU 2002\u20132004, CSPU 2003\u20132005, CSPU 2004\u20132006, CSPU 2005\u20132006, and CSPU 2006. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n44. \nADB  took  its  first  steps  into  the  Azerbaijan  market  in  2006  with  the  provision  of  a \nfinancing  package  of  up  to  $15  million  to  privately  owned  banks  and  leasing  companies. 10 \nThese loans have been well received in the market, and have provided a number of follow-up \nopportunities. Since then, ADB has made considerable efforts to explore new opportunities and \nstrengthen  client  relationships,  in  line  with  its  focus  on  banking,  to  improve  financial \nintermediation in the non-oil sector. \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s efforts in Azerbaijan have focused on providing assistance to private sector banks, \nand  have  excluded  state-owned  banks.  As  ADB  shifts  to  the  next  phase  of  financial  sector \ndevelopment\u2014i.e., \nthe  provision  of  new  and  more  sophisticated  products,  such  as \nsecuritization\u2014it  will  need  to  form  partnerships  with  institutions  that  have  the  technical  and \nfinancial capacity to implement such transactions. By and large, private banks are not yet in a \nposition  to  transition  to  these  types  of  products.  IBA  has  shown  keen  interest  in  pursuing  a \nDiversified  Payment  Rights  securitization  in  2008  once  it  successfully  concludes  its  planned \ninaugural eurobond issue in 2007, and has initiated discussions with ADB on this transaction.  \n \n46. \nIn  addition,  given  its  financial  resources  and  international  standing,  IBA  plays  a \nfundamental role in the country\u2019s banking sector and economy. The successful recapitalization \nof IBA supports the Government\u2019s long-term plans and efforts to privatize the bank, which has \nbeen  mandated  by  law.  Further,  IBA\u2019s  efforts  to  provide  increased  financial  intermediation  to \nSMEs and retail clients, where private banks hold a significant share of the market, will support \nthe creation of jobs and livelihood opportunities outside the oil and gas sector. This, in turn, will \ncontribute to sustainable economic growth and private sector development. In this sense, IBA is \nnot crowding out private sector banks, but is playing a complementary role in growing the SME \nsector. \n \n47. \nSubordinated  (tier  2)  debt  has  been  identified  as  a  key  development  product\n  that \nshould  be  utilized  even  by  ADB.  ADB  is  implementing  this  recommendation  and  processing \nother  subordinated  loans  in  Azerbaijan.  ADB  perceives  this  as  a  step  toward  more  complex \ntransactions. IBA, as a leading bank in the country, also can become an important example in \nthis  respect.  In  this  sense,  this  loan  is  a  direct  answer  to  the  request  of  the  Government  for \nrecapitalization of IBA (and other banks in the country).  \n \n48. \n which states \nthat ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\u201d as these \nare  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing  savings,  and  ensuring \navailability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d \n \n \nB. \n\nThe proposed loan is also aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,\n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n\n11\n\n12\n\n49. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  classified  as  Category  FI  (financial  intermediary)  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  IBA  has  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  in  place \nbased  on  the  Black  Sea  Development  Bank\u2019s  environmental  safeguards  (Appendix  17  for  a \nshort summary).  The implementing procedures and the underlying policy are in line with ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for a bank of this nature and have been reviewed by ADB. IBA has the capacity to \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Proposed Assistance to Private Banks and Leasing Companies in Azerbaijan. Manila. \n11 ADB. 2007.

Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13\n\nHISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANKING SECTOR IN AZERBAIJAN \n\nHistorical Overview \n\nA. \n \nInstitutional  and  legal  establishment  of  the  banking  system  in  Azerbaijan  began  after \n1. \nindependence  in  1991.  The  basic  objectives  of  the  development  stage  of  the  banking  system \nwere to establish the institutions and infrastructure, and to provide for the normal functioning of \nthe system. \n \n2. \nAdoption  of  the  Law  on  the  National  Bank  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  and  the  Law  on \nBanks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic established the legal-normative basis of \nthe banking system. The initial stage of the banking system was marked by liberal conditions of \nentry  into  the  market.  With  the  objective  of  stimulating  the  establishment  of  banking  system \ninstitutions, the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) required minimal capital and used relatively \nsoft  control  mechanisms.  As  a  result,  233  banks  and  370  bank  branches  registered  and \noperated during 1993\u20131994 in Azerbaijan. \n \n3. \nThe  evolution  stage  of  the  banking  system,  which  began  in  1996,  established  new \npriorities  by  taking  into  account  of  the  institutional  establishment  of  the  banking  system. \nAdministrative means, which NBA used to regulate the banking sector, were gradually replaced \nby prudent supervision.  \n \n4. \nAs a result of the strengthening of the banking system, protection of depositors\u2019 interests, \nand  promotion  of  sound  competition,  quantitative  parameters  were  transformed  to  qualitative \nparameters.  Special  attention  was  paid  to  financial  indicators  of  banks,  i.e.,  capital,  liquidity, \nprofitability,  security  of \ntechnological  processes,  and \nmanagement information systems. \n \nWith the consolidation of the banking system, development of banks, and strengthening \n5. \nof their capitalization, aggregate bank capital increased by 22 times, total investment by 3 times, \nand attracted savings by 8 times. The weight of bank assets in gross domestic product (GDP) \nreached 28%. \n \n6. \nAt this stage of banking system development, to restructure the state banks, the capital \nof banks was incorporated and the share of the state in the banking system as a proprietor was \nreduced.  Programs  were  carried  out  to  prepare  state  banks  for  privatization  and  institutional \ndevelopment.  \n \n7. \nIn  1998,  the  Government  established  as  an  objective  increasing  institutional  variety  on \nthe legal basis of nonbank credit organizations. Financial entities, which numbered 13 in 1998, \nreached 82 in 2001. The next stage of historical evolution of the banking system, i.e., intensive \nrestructuring  and  recovery  of  the  banking  system,  started  in  2000.  Such  recovery  measures \nwere  aimed  at  establishing  a  banking  system  that  was  adequately  capitalized  with  sound, \nsufficient management systems. To establish precise efficiency parameters, audits were carried \nout to evaluate financial condition, capitalization, liquidity, profitability management mechanisms \nand  systems,  in-house  procedures,  and  other  aspects.  Furthermore,  raising  the  efficiency  of \nbank  services, \ninformation  systems,  and  applying  new  bank \ntechnologies was supported. These measures fully embraced the private banking sector. \n \n8. \nRestructuring  and  recovery  of  the  banking  system  were  carried  out  in  two  systems\u2014\nrestructuring  of  state  banks  and  the  private  banking  system.  In  the  process,  Industrial-\n\ntransactions,  use  of  progressive \n\nimproving  management \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nInvestment  Bank,  Savings  Banks,  and  Agrarian-Industrial  Bank  were  merged,  and  BUS  Bank \nwas established. In addition, Mbank and Promtekhbank announced their merger in July 2002 to \ncreate Unibank, Azerbaijan\u2019s third largest bank by assets. \n \nOther  state  bank  structures  were  consolidated  into  the  Agrarian-Industrial  Bank.  The \n9. \nAgrarian-Industrial  Bank  was  transformed  into  a  nonbank  credit  organization  acting  under  a \nlimited  license  to  regulate  bad  debts  and,  thereby,  solve  the  problem  of  low-quality  assets \ninherent in former states of the Soviet Union. \n \nB.       Role and Regulations of the National Bank of Azerbaijan \n\n10. \nOn 7 August 1992, in addition to the law on banks and banking activity, the NBA law was \nadopted. The manat, the national currency of Azerbaijan, was issued on 15 August 1992. On 1 \nDecember 1992, the Milli Mejis1 of Azerbaijan passed the Resolution on Approval of the Charter \nof the NBA. These legislative acts established the NBA as the supreme state bank, which has \nexclusive  right  to  issue  banknotes  and  carry  out  reserve  system  functions.  At  the  same  time, \nNBA  was  granted  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  over  the  banking  system.  NBA  is  the \ncentral bank of Azerbaijan. Its status, basic functions and duties, organization, and principles of \nactivity are determined by the constitution, the NBA law, and other legislative acts. \n \nThe  basic  objectives  of  NBA  are  to  (i)  ensure  stability  of  the  manat,  take  measures  to \n11. \nregulate  its  purchasing  power  and  exchange  rate  versus  foreign  currency,  and  determine \nmonetary  and  credit  policy;  (ii)  carry  out  cash  emission;  (iii)  pay  off  state  debts  in  accordance \nwith  the  current  laws  of  Azerbaijan;  and  (iv)  participate  in  the  preparation  of  balance  of \npayments forecasts, and to draw up balanced payment reports of Azerbaijan. \n \n12. \nThe main functions of NBA are (i) pursuing state policy in monetary, credit, and currency \nrelations;  (ii)  facilitating  settlements  and  stable  operation  of  the  payment  system;  (iii) \naccomplishing  transactions  in  the  securities  market,  as  well  as  purchase  and  sale  of  foreign \ncurrency;  (iv)  taking  necessary  measures  to  develop  and  strengthen  the  banking  system  in \nAzerbaijan;  (v)  carrying  out  currency  regulation,  determining  procedures  for  settlements  with \nforeign countries, and managing foreign currency reserves; and (vi) adopting normative acts in \nthe field of banking activity. \n \n13. \nIn recent years, NBA has used the exchange rate of the manat to help anchor domestic \nprice levels, contributing to low inflation, increasing international reserves, and growing external \ncompetitiveness, as reflected in the rapid growth of non-oil exports in recent years. It also plans \nto continue to follow carefully the developments in the domestic market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Azerbaijan Parliament. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n15\n\nBANKING SECTOR OUTLOOK \n\n \n1. \nThe asset growth trend in Azerbaijan during the next few years is forecast to exceed the \npace of previous years. The National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) expects banking indicators and \nbank performance to improve. Banks will continue to increase their capital; attract more foreign \ninvestments; improve risk management; and increase profitability, efficiency, and asset quality. \n \n2. \nThe  process  of  revising  the  legislative  framework  of  the  Azeri  banking  system  will \ncontinue.  New  legislation  will  foster  banking  sector  development,  strengthen  banks\u2019  corporate \ngovernance,  provide  a  new  framework  for  mortgage  lending,  bolster  the  central  bank\u2019s \nsupervisory control, improve the ability to fight money laundering and the financing of terrorism, \nstrengthen  NBA\u2019s  independence  in  the  formulation  and  execution  of  monetary  policy,  improve \nthe accountability of NBA, and enhance its transparency by establishing a clear mechanism for \ndistributing NBA\u2019s profit.  \n \n3. \nIn addition, NBA started re-denomination of the manat. From 1 January 2006, the value \nof the manat has increased by a factor of 5,000. Six new banknotes and five types of coins have \nbeen issued. NBA said the main reason for re-denomination is preventing further dollarization of \nthe  economy,  as  the  nominal  exchange  rate  is  now  close  to  the  current  US  dollar  rate. \nFurthermore,  the  re-denomination  plays  a  vital  role  in  strengthening  the  national  currency  and \nsimplifying arithmetical calculations during trade operations. It also will ease the work of banks. \nCurrently, the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) is the largest bank with the largest number \ncustomer  current  accounts.  Therefore,  IBA\u2019s  responsibility  in  the  re-denomination  process  is \nsignificant.  \n \n4. \nOn  15  April  2005,  the  Mortgage  Law  was  adopted.  As  of  1  March  2006,  authorized \nbanks submitted the first applications for mortgage loans, and a number of them have granted \nmortgages to individuals. During 2005, NBA adopted regulations on corporate governance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  NBA statistics \n \n\n \n\u2022 \n\nIBA\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n \n\u2022  Reports specifically \n\n \n\u2022 \n\nrequested by ADB \n\n16 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \n \nThe GDP \ncomposition of the \nAzerbaijan  economy \nis more diversified \n(i.e., more SMEs, in \nmore sectors, \ncontribute to a more \ndiversified economy) \n\nOutcome \n \nIBA provides \nincreased, \nsustainable access to \nfinance for SMEs and \nindividuals in \nAzerbaijan \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n \n\u2022  Percentage of \n\nGDP contributed \nby SMEs rises \nfrom 10% to 15% \nin 5 years \n\n \n\u2022  Percentage of \nemployment \ncontributed by \nSMEs rises from \n75% to 85% in 5 \nyears \n\n \n \n\u2022  IBA\u2019s SME loan \n\nportfolio increases \nto 10% of total \nloan portfolio in 24 \nmonths \n\n \n\u2022  IBA\u2019s retail loan \n\nportfolio increases \nto 20% of total \nloan portfolio in 24 \nmonths \n\n \n\u2022  IBA\u2019s credit quality \nremains high with \nNPL levels less \nthan 5.0% \n\n \n\u2022  IBA\u2019s ROE stays \nabove 25.0% \n\n \n\u2022  IBA\u2019s CAR meets \nNBA requirements \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022 \n\nIncreased access to \nfinance from banks will \nlead to more SMEs \nreceiving loans and \nexpanding their role in \nthe economy \n\n \n\u2022  Stable or increased \n\neconomic \ndevelopment in \nAzerbaijan \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  SMEs have demand \n\nloans \n\nIBA does not breach \ndomestic prudential/ \nNBA norms \n\n \n\u2022  No adverse economic \ndevelopments in \nAzerbaijan \n\n \n\u2022  No regulatory changes \nfor the banking sector \n\n \n\u2022  No other exogenous \nfactors that have a \nnegative impact on \nbanking sector \ndevelopment  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n\u2022  ADB provides \n\nsubordinated loan \n\n \n\u2022  IBA \n\n\u2022  At the end of 2007, \nIBA has additional \ntier 2 capital of $40 \nmillion  \n\n\u2022  IBA\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\n\u2022  Stability of prevailing \nmarket conditions \n\n\u2022  All regulatory approvals \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\noperationalizes \nuse of \nsubordinated \nproceeds \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  Loan requests  \nreceived by IBA \nfrom SMEs and \nretail clients \nincrease by 25%  \nper year from \ncurrent levels \n\n \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n\u2022  Reports specifically \nrequested by ADB \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n17\n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nin place for ADB  \n\n \n\u2022  IBA is able to raise tier \n1 capital to access $40 \nmillion of subordinated \nloan from ADB  \n\n \n\nActivities with Milestones \n \n1.1 Provide IBA with up to $40.0 million subordinated loan by September \n\nInputs \n \n\u2022  ADB\u2014$40.0 million \n\n2007 \n\u2022  ADB and IBA enter into a subordinated loan agreement \n\n \n1.2 Operationalization of proceeds of subordinated loan by IBA \n\n(ongoing). \n\u2022  Origination of (new) SME and retail client opportunities \n\u2022  Due diligence on clients \n\u2022  Completion of loan agreements with clients \n\u2022  Disbursement of loans to clients \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CAR  =  capital  adequacy  ratio,  IBA  =  International  Bank  of  Azerbaijan,  GDP  =  gross \ndomestic product, NBA = National Bank of Azerbaijan, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROE = return on equity, SMEs = small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 September 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Azerbaijan new manat (AZN) \n", " AZN1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$1.09529 \nAZN0.91300 \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", " \n \n", " \nADB \n \nATM \nCSPU   \n \nGDP \n \nIBA \n \nNBA \n \nNPL \nPOS \n \nSMEs   \n \n", " \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nautomated teller machine \ncountry strategy and program update \ngross domestic product \nInternational Bank of Azerbaijan \nNational Bank of Azerbaijan \nnonperforming loan \npoint of sale \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises \n", "NOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "L.
