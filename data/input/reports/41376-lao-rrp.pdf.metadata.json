This  first-time  program \nsupport  to  Lao  PDR's  health  sector  will  help  the  Ministry  of  Health \nmove  toward  a  sector  program  approach.  The  combined  outputs  are \n(i)  strengthened  planning  and  financing;  (ii)  increased  access  to \nmaternal,  newborn,  and  child  health  (MNCH)  care;  and  (iii)  improved \nquality of human resources for health (HRH).  \n \nStarting from a low base, the country\u2019s health indicators still lag behind \nthose  of  most  other  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Challenges \ninclude widespread poverty, isolated populations, limited public sector \ncapacity,  and  low  public  financing.  The  sector  will  remain  dependent \non  external  funding  until  domestic  revenues  from  Nam  Theun  2  and \nother sources become substantial, around 2020.   \n \nA PHC network has been put in place, and access to basic health care \nhas  been  substantially  improved  through  a  network  of  district \nhospitals,  health  centers,  and  village  health  volunteers  with  drug \nrevolving  funds.  However,  health  services  are  seriously  underfunded \nand often lack skilled personnel, high out-of-pocket fees deter the poor \nfrom  using  services,  and  appropriate  services  for  women  and  some \nethnic groups are often lacking.   \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  poverty  and  achieving \nMDGs,  and  has  identified  the  health  sector  as  one  of  four  priority \nsectors. The 7th Health Sector Development Plan is to be supported by \na  results-based  sector  program  approach  and  will  focus  on  eight \npriority  areas,  including  the  model  healthy  village,  safe  motherhood, \nchild  survival,  nutrition  and  emerging  diseases,  HRH,  management, \nfinancing, and aid coordination.  \n \nIn  line  with  the  Lao  PDR  country  partnership  strategy,  the  Program \nconsolidates  ADB\u2019s  past  investments  in  PHC  in  eight  northern \nprovinces  and  provincial  health  management  countrywide,  and \n\n \nBeneficiary \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nresponds  to  the  Government's  efforts  and  ADB's  commitment  to \nimplement the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.   \n \nThe Program will provide a platform for the sector program approach \nfor  support  from  other  partners.  The  sector  development  program \nmodality  provides  support  for  policy  reforms  and  technical  and \nfinancial resources to implement reforms.   \n \nIn addition, ADB will provide capacity building technical assistance for \nfinancial  management  in  the  health  sector  to  help  implement  the \nsector  program  approach.  In  public  administration,  ADB  will  also \ncontinue  to  support  the  preparation  of  Lao  PDR's  medium-term \nexpenditure framework and public expenditure management.  \n\n \n\nThe impact of the HSDP will be reduced maternal and child mortality \nand malnutrition by 2015. The outcome will be improved use of PHC, \nin particular for the poor, women and children, and ethnic groups.  \n \nThe  program  grant  supports  reforms  for  (i)  strengthened  provincial \nplanning  and  financing,  including  an  increase  in  nonsalary  recurrent \nbudget,  standards  and  guidelines  for  hospitals,  a  national  health \ninformation  system,  and  rolling  out  health  equity  funds;  (ii)  increased \naccess to MNCH care through a national MNCH strategy, and rolling \nout  mother-  and  child-friendly  health  services  and  model  healthy \nvillages; and (iii) improved quality of personnel through a national HRH \npolicy and skilled birth attendance plan. The Government is committed \nto  releasing  the  equivalent  of  program  funds  to  the  provinces  for \nnonsalary  recurrent  budget  support  for  operation  and  maintenance; \nfor  rolling  out  mother-  and \noutreach;  staff \nchild-friendly health services, model healthy villages, and health equity \nfunds.   \n \nADB will provide a program grant of $10 million from its Special Funds \nresources to be released in two tranches ($5 million each), subject to \ncompliance with grant conditions as provided in the policy matrix, with \nthe first tranche to be released upon grant effectiveness and a second \ntranche within 24 months post-effectiveness.  \n \n\nimprovement;  and \n\n \nCounterpart Funds  The size of the program grant is based on the medium-term costs of \nproposed  policy  actions  with  an  estimated  adjustment  cost  of  $15 \nmillion for the reforms. The Government will pass on the equivalent of \nthe program funds from the Ministry of Finance to the provinces using \na program fund mechanism.   \n \n1 January 2010\u201330 June 2012. \n\n \nProgram Period \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  program  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  excluding  items  included  on  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.

ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  grant \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the recipient's certification. \n \nThe  project  grant  will  support  the  program  outputs  through  specific \ninvestments and assistance for the implementation of the reforms. The \nProject  will  help  strengthen  provincial  planning  and  budgeting  for \nresults-based program support; increase access to MNCH services by \nimproving  four  hospitals  and  45  health  centers;  increase  in-service \ntraining  especially  for  skilled  birth  attendants;  upgrade  training \nprograms for PHC workers; improve pre-service training; and help roll \nout  priority  programs  for  mother  and  child-friendly  services,  model \nhealthy villages, and provincial health equity funds. \n \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $10.8  million,  including  physical  and \nprice contingencies, duties, and taxes.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10.0  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  to  cover  93%  of  the  project  cost.

Within  the  ministry,  program \nimplementation will be delegated to concerned departments acting as \nnational \nthe  departments  of \nCurative,  Food  and  Drugs,  and  Organization  and  Personnel,  and  the \nMNCH  Hospital.

A \nMinistry  of  Health  steering  committee  will  provide  overall  guidance  in \nproject  implementation.  A  sector-wide  coordination  mechanism  is  in \nplace with the support of the World Health Organization and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nWorks,  goods,  and  services  totaling  $100,000  and  above  will  be \n\n \nProject Grant \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfor  a \n\nexperts \n\nprogram  management \n\nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding.

Vehicles may be procured through the United Nations Office \nfor Project Services, as its procurement procedures are acceptable to \nADB. \n \nThe  HSDP  will  require  five  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  39 \nperson-months,  six  national  consultants \ntotal  of  71 \nperson-months, and two national firms for architecture and accounting. \nThe \n(20 \nin \ninternational \nperson-months),  MNCH \n(3  person-months),  medical  education \ndevelopment  (7  person-months),  gender  (6  person-months),  and \nhealth  equity  funds  (3  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual \nconsultants,  with  advance  action  for  engaging  the  planning  and \nfinancing expert. Accounting and architecture firms will be hired using \nbiodata technical proposal and consultant qualification selection. Other \nnational  consultants  will  be  hired  as  individual  consultants.  All \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Program  will  have  significant  impacts  on  the  health  of  the  poor, \nwomen and children, and ethnic groups, as it will address core issues \nin operationalizing the PHC system that has been put in place. In the \nshort term, recurrent budget support will improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency  of  service  delivery,  increasing  coverage  and  impact.  In  the \nmedium to long term, better access to affordable quality services and \nimproved village health will have a major impact on progress towards \nthe MDGs, life expectancy, and public health.    \n \nVery  low,  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditure  in  the  health  sector \nseriously  affects  the  performance  of  health  services  and  outreach. \nWhile  increasing  Government  revenue  from  Nam  Theun  2  and  other \nsources  will  improve  health  sector  financing  in  the  long  term,  bridge \nfunding  is  needed  for  the  coming  10  years.  The  Government  has \ncommitted  to  provide  the  equivalent  of  program  support  to  the \nprovinces for nonsalary recurrent budget support. \n \nExpected  technical  efficiency  gains  from  increased  capacity  in \nplanning and financial management will position the Ministry of Health \nfor approval of Nam Theun 2 proposals for future recurrent funding for \nhealth sector operational expenses. \n \nThe program funding modality and fund-flow mechanism for the health \nsector  have  been  endorsed  by  the  Government,  but  the  funding \nmechanism  still  needs  to  be  put  in  place.  ADB  will  provide  capacity \nbuilding technical assistance to develop the fund-flow mechanism and \nto  strengthen \nthe  provinces \nfinancial  management  capacity  of \ndeveloped through previous projects. \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f102  00'Eo\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA\n\nGnot-Ou\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nHEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nBoun Nua\n\nPhongsali\n\nPHONGSALI\n\nSamphan\n\nMai\n\nSing\n\nBoun Tai\n\nLouang-Namtha\n\nLong\n\nLOUANG-NAMTHA\n\nNamo\n\nKhoua\n\nLa\n\nViangphoukha\n\nXai\n\nNambak\n\nNgoy\n\nM Y A N M A R\nM ekong River\n\nMeung\nBOKEO\n\nBan\nMom\n\nTonpheung\n\nEt Xiangkho\nSopbao\n\nViengxai\n\nHOUAPHAN\n\nXam-Tai\n\nNale\n\nOUDOMXAI\n\nViangkham\n\nXam-Nua\n\nHouayxay\n\nBeng\n\nPha-Oudom\n\n20  00'No\n\nPaktha\n\nPakbeng\n\nNga\n\nHoun\n\nChomphet\n\nXianghon\n\nKhop\n\nNgeun\n\nNamthouam\nLOUANGPHRABANG\n\nPak-Ou\n\nPakxeng\n\nViengthong\n\nPhonxai\n\nLouangphrabang\n\nXiang-Ngeun\n\nEt\n\nKham\n\nHoua-Muang\n\nHongsa\n\nXaignabouli\n\nPhoukhoun\n\nNan\n\nPhiang\n\nKasi\n\nPhoukout\n\nPhaxai\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nXaisomboun\n\nPek\n\nNonghet\n\nKhoun\nMok-Mai \n\nXIANGKHOUANG\n\nThathom\n\nXAIGNABOULI\n\nMet\n\nVangvieng\n\nFuang\n\nNon Hai\n\nThongmixai\n\nPhonhong\n\nSangthong\n\nKeo-Oudom\n\nThaphabat\n\nThoulakhom\n\nHom\n\nBolikhan\n\nBOLIKHAMXAI\nViangthong\n\nPakxan\n\nPakkading\n\nKhamkeut\n\nPaklay\n\nNaxaythong\nSikhottabong\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nXaithani\n\nMai Pak-Ngum\n\nBoten\n\nXanakham\n\nKenethao\n\nChanthabouli\n\nXaisettha\nVIENTIANE\nCAPITAL\n\nHatxayfong\n\nSisattanak\n\n20  00'No\n\nVIET  NAM\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\nTHAILAND\n\nHinboun\n\nNakay\nKHAMMOUAN\n\nGnommalat\n\nM\n\ne\n\nk\n\no\n\nn\n\ng Riv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nThakhek\n\nNongbok\n\nMahaxai\n\nBoualapha\n\nXebangfai\n\nXaibouathong\n\nAtsaphon\n\nVilabouly\n\nXaibouly\n\nOuthoumphon\n\nAtsaphangthong\n\nXepon\n\nPhalanxai\n\n16  00'No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nN\n\nKaysone Phomvihane\n\nChamphon\n\nXonbouri\n\nSAVANNAKHET\n\nPhin\n\nNong\n\nXaiphouthong\n\nSongkhon\n\nSamouay\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nPaved Provincial Road\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n102  00'Eo\n\nThapangthong\n\nTa-Oy\nToumlan\n\n16  00'No\n\nLakhonpheng\n\nVapi\n\nSaLavan\n\nKalum\n\nKhongxedon\n\nSALAVAN\n\nXEKONG\n\nThateng\n\nSanasomboun\n\nLao-Ngam\n\nLamam Dakchung\n\nBachiangchaleunsouk\n\nPhonthong\n\nChampasak\n\nSoukhouma\n\nPakxe\n\nPakxong\n\nPathoumphon\n\nSanxai\n\nXaisettha\nSamakkhixai\n\nCHAMPASAK\n\nSanamxai\n\nATTAPEU\n\nPhouvong\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n106  00'Eo\n\n09-2653 HR\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nMounlapamok\n\nKhong\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  (i)  proposed \nprogram grant, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao  PDR)  for  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (HSDP).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nCountry Context \n\n1. \n \n2. \nThe  Lao  PDR  has  made  significant  but  uneven  progress  toward  its  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs).1 With  the  overarching  goal  of poverty  reduction,  the 6th  National  \nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  identifies  the  health  sector  as  one  of  four \npriority  sectors.2 The  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  has  requested  that  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  support  the  health  sector  with  a  sector  program  approach  to  improve  sector \nperformance  toward  MDGs,  in  line  with  the  Vientiane  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness.3 The \nHSDP is included in the country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011, for $20 million in 2009.4 \n \n3. \nThe Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. However, its average \nper capita income increased from $335 in 2000 to $491 in 2005, then to an estimated $840 in \n2008. Overall income poverty declined from 46% in 1992 to 27% in 2008,5 but economic growth \nhas been primarily urban.6  \n \n4. \nThe country is in transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy, and \neconomic growth is being driven by already completed investments and expansion of outputs. In \nthe last decade, the Lao PDR\u2019s annual gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate \nof 7.2%.7 Real gross domestic product growth is projected to decline to 5.5% in FY2009 due to \nfalling commodity prices, declining exports, and a marked decrease in the garments and tourism \nsectors.  In-migration  of  low-income  workers  has  put  more  strain  on  the  labor  market,  and  low \nelectricity demand caused a delay in major hydropower project construction.  \n \nThe global economic crisis has also added to the Government's budget deficit,8 following \n5. \nemergency spending for flooding and oil price mitigation in 2008. The Government is planning to \nbridge the revenue gap through a range of measures, including seeking additional external aid, \nand estimates that additional external aid totaling $50 million\u2013$60 million is needed in FY2010.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment,  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2008.

ADB Lao Resident Mission, May 2009. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n2. \n\nSector Progress \n\n \n\n \nIn  2009,  the  Lao  PDR  has  an  estimated  population  of  6.2  million,  and  an  annual \n6. \npopulation growth rate of 2%.9\n Its rural population is highly scattered, with an average density of \n24 people per square kilometer\u2014much less than neighboring countries\u2014resulting in substantial \nin-migration.  Fully  73%  of  its  people  live  in  rural  areas  scattered  over  10,552  villages  in  17 \nprovinces  and  141  districts.  The  Lao  mainly  live  in  the  valleys  of  the  Mekong  River  and  its \ntributaries.  Small  ethnic  groups,  about  30%  of  the  population,  live  in  more  remote  and \nmountainous locations, are often poor, and have limited access to services and markets.  \n \n7. \nBetween 1990 and 2005, the Lao PDR\u2019s child mortality rate reduced substantially from \n170 to 98 per 1,000 live births, putting the country on track to achieve its MDG of 55 per 1,000 \nlive  births  in  2015.  Sadly,  newborn  deaths  (i.e.,  deaths  within  the  first  month  after  birth)  still \naccount  for  nearly  one  half  of  infant  mortality  and  nearly  one  third  of  child  mortality.  Child \nmalnutrition remains high, with an underweight rate of 37% in 2006, compared with a target of \n20% in 2015. The maternal mortality rate also decreased from 750 to 405 per 100,000 live births \nbetween 1990 and 2005, but the country is still likely to miss its target of 185 per 100,000 live \nbirths in 2015. Between 2000 and 2005, the total fertility rate declined from 4.9 to 4.1 children \nper woman, and the contraceptive prevalence rate has doubled in 10 years to about 40%. Less \nthan one quarter of women is attended by skilled health personnel when giving birth.  \n \n8. \nInfections still cause the major burden of diseases in the Lao PDR, with malaria as the \nmost  often  reported  cause  of  illness.  With  support  from  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria, malaria incidence has been reduced to 0.4%. While 87% of children \nbelow age 5 years sleep under a bed net, only 43% sleep under an insecticide-treated net.10 Of \nchildren  less  than  age  1  year,  70%  are  immunized  against  measles,  but  a  much  smaller \nproportion  is  fully  immunized.11 With  increasing  connectivity  in  the  subregion,  the  country  has \nseen  an  increase  in  its  HIV/AIDS  prevalence.  Further,  emerging  diseases  and  dengue  fever \noutbreaks,  road  accidents,  and  welfare  diseases  have  put  new  demands  on  underresourced \nhealth services. \n \nUnder the stewardship of the Ministry of Health (MOH), the last decade saw significant \n9. \nexpansion  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  health  services  network,  including  hospitals,  health  centers, \noutreach, village health care, and associated programs. In the Lao PDR, there are 4 central, 4 \nspecialized, 4 regional, 12 provincial, and 126 district hospitals. Due to low population density, \ndistrict hospitals have relatively small catchment populations of 10,000\u201350,000 people. Only 26 \n\u201ctype A\u201d district hospitals provide emergency surgery, unlike 100 \u201ctype B\u201d district hospitals. The \n789  health  centers  serve  small  catchment  populations  of  1,000\u20135,000  people.  One  health \ncenter serves as a focal service point for about eight villages, including for obstetric care. MOH \nalso  operates  centrally  managed  priority  programs  linked  to  a  specific  MOH  department12 and \noften  also  specific  development  partners,  especially  for  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health \n(MNCH) and communicable disease control.  \n \nVillages  have  a  village  health  committee  to  ensure  a  healthy  village  environment, \n10. \nadequate  village  health  care,  and  timely  referral  of  emergencies.  If  it  is  more  than  a  2-hour \n                                                 \n9  National Statistical Centre of the Lao PDR. 2005. Population Census 2005.

There  are  5,668 \nvillages  (54%)  with  drug  kits.  Members  of  mass  organizations  like  the  Lao  Front  for  National \nConstruction  and  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  volunteer  as  peer  educators  for  health  and  nutrition \npromotion.  Village  private  providers  include  former  paramedics,  drug  shop  owners,  and \ntraditional healers. Licensed private providers are mostly located in urban areas.  \n\n11. \nDespite this extensive network, the overall use of health services remains low. Data from \nthe  2008  health  information  system  suggest  that  there  were  0.3  outpatient  visits  per  1,000 \npopulation  per  year  at  all  public  health  facilities  in  the  Lao  PDR,  compared  to  international \nstandards of 1\u20132 interactions with a health facility per year. Bed occupancy rates average 40%, \nand the capacity of health infrastructure in the Lao PDR exceeds its current use. MOH is facing \na  major  challenge  to  make  the  system  more  effective,  efficient,  equitable,  and  sustainable  to \nhelp achieve MDGs by 2015.  \n \n12. \nData from 1999 to 2008 in eight northern provinces illustrate primary health care (PHC) \nprogram  impact  on  utilization  by  the  poor.  VHVs  with  drug  kits  have  substantially  improved \naccess to basic care for both the lowest and second-lowest quintiles, as well as ethnic groups.13 \nAbout 75% of these provinces\u2019 population have access to safe water, surpassing MDG targets. \nFurther,  a  50%  access  rate  to  latrines  will  likely  achieve  the  MDG  target.14 However,  health \nservices  remain  relatively  less  used,  particularly  by  women  and  children.  Overall,  reaching \nMDGs will require more resources to reach lagging communities and households.  \n \n13. \nTotal health expenditure has increased from about $12 to $19 per person between 2005 \nand 2009,15 compared to an international standard of $34 for developing countries in 2000. The \nincrease is mostly due  to higher household out-of-pocket spending. The share of domestically \nfinanced government health spending in total health expenditure was 9.7% in 2005. External aid \nhas  kept  the  share  of  government  health  spending  in  total  health  expenditures  at  33.7%,  with \nthe  remaining  66.3%  coming  from  out-of-pocket  expenditures.  In  real  terms,  public  spending \nhas remained almost constant at around $30 million per year (in current 2009 dollars), or $5\u2013$6 \nper capita from FY2003 to FY2007, with the exception of FY2005 due to an increase in external \naid.16 Domestic  spending  increased  from  $12.6  million  in  FY2003  to  $16.8  million  in  FY2007, \nand  this  trend  is  continuing.  This  increase  is  mainly  for  actual  wage  increases  as  the  health \nworkforce remained more or less constant. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  6th  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  identifies  health  as  one  of  four \npriority sectors for development. The Health Policy and Strategy up to the Year 2020 (2000)17 \nand Primary Health Care policy (2000)18 formulate a vision of achieving health for all through a \nnational public health system based on the principles of PHC and model healthy villages. The \nGovernment is aiming for mandated, universal coverage of the population with health insurance \n\nSector Plans, Policies, and Priorities \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n13 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 1999.

Public financing and provision of services will \ncontinue  to  be  required  in  the  future  given  high  levels  of  poverty,  considerable  market  failure, \nand  limited  private  sector  capacity,  especially  in  remote  areas.  With  new  legislation,  the \nGovernment is also encouraging nongovernment organization and private sector development, \nand urban areas have seen a considerable increase in private practitioners.  \n \n15.  MOH is currently implementing the 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).19 \nA  midterm  review  of  the  plan  in  September  2008  identified  eight  priorities:  (i)  model  healthy \nvillages, (ii) maternal mortality reduction, (iii) child survival, (iv) nutrition and preparedness, (v) \nhuman  resources  for  health  (HRH),  (vi)  organization  and  management,  (vii)  health  care \nfinancing,  and  (viii)  aid  harmonization.  MOH  is  also  preparing  the  7th  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Plan (2011\u20132015), which is being planned and budgeted from districts upwards. \nThis plan will contain the objectives, priorities, strategies, targets, and medium-term expenditure \nprojections for each province and MOH to meet MDG targets for health over the next 5 years.  \n \n16.  MOH has introduced a range of policies to guide health sector reforms, as summarized \nin Appendix 2. Particularly relevant for village care are the national nutrition policy (approved in \n2008) and a decree on model healthy villages  (2009). These policies should help address the \npersistently high malnutrition rate of about 30% and improve overall health status through better \nvillage environments, village health care, social safety nets, and timely referrals. Second, MOH \nand  partners  have  prepared  The  National  Strategy  for  MNCH 20 to  improve  MNCH  delivery, \nincluding  timely  referrals  and  access  to  emergency  obstetric  care.  MOH  has  also  prepared  a \ndraft  national  HRH  policy  to  improve  staff  skills,  quality,  and  distribution.  Further,  MOH  is \naddressing the issue of cost recovery by rolling out provincial health equity funds for the poor. A \nnew health financing policy is scheduled for 2011 to address more long-term solutions for health \nfinancing, universal health insurance, and aid harmonization. While these reforms are potentially \nbeneficial toward achieving MDGs and putting the health sector on a more sustainable footing, \nthe sector is relatively late to develop. Moreover, there are multiple managerial, technical, and \nfinancing constraints in implementing these policies and plans.  \n \n17.  MOH  is  proposing  that  the  7th  Health  Sector  Development  Plan  form  the  basis  for  a \nsector  program  approach  in  line  with  the  Vientiane  Declaration.  ADB  is  a  leading  partner  in \nimplementing the Vientiane Declaration and is committed to increasing program-based lending. \nThe  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA) \nhave been assisting MOH with the establishment of an aid coordination mechanism.21 MOH and \nits development partners have endorsed a new sector-wide coordination framework for health, \nand  there  is  general  agreement  on  the  way  forward  (Appendix  2,  Table  A2.2)  to  a  joint \nformulation,  management,  and  monitoring  of  a  single  sector  program.  Toward  this  objective, \nsector  working  groups  have  been  established  at  the  policy,  operational,  and  technical  levels, \nincluding  technical  working  groups  for  PHC,  MNCH,  HRH,  and  health  financing  and \nmanagement.  Sector  reforms  take  place  in  the context  of  a  broader  review  and  adjustment  of \npublic  sector  fundamentals,  including  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  levels  in  the \nsector;  sources  and  uses  of  funds;  results-based  planning  and  budgeting;  and  financial \nmanagement with support of ADB, World Bank, and other development partners.   \n \n\n                                                 \n19 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

With  low  per  capita  income  and  high  levels  of  poverty,  public  spending  on  health  is \ncritical  in  the  Lao  PDR.  However,  a  major  challenge  confronting  the  health  sector\u2019s  efforts  to \nachieve  the  MDG  targets  is  the  low  level  of  public  financing,  which  is  inadequate  to  run  even \ncurrent  services.  Low  public  spending  on  health  results  in  significant  out-of-pocket  expenses \nincurred by the population for health care in public facilities. This deters the poor from using the \nservices, with a range of consequences for individuals, households, and the public.  \n \n19. \nPrior  to  decentralization  in  2000,  provincial  budgets  were  prepared  centrally,  but  the \nGovernment  now  has  a  highly  decentralized  financing  system.  Provincial  authorities  prepare \ntheir budgets based on general directions and broad budgeting norms, and then submit these to \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  for  approval. \nProvincial  budgets  are  mainly  for  operational  costs  with  small  investments  for  provincial \npriorities  and  counterpart  funding.22 Provincial  recurrent  public  health  services  costs  are  paid \nfrom revenues collected by the provincial authorities, and are largely absorbed by the number of \npersonnel assigned by MOH to the provinces, leaving limited funds for other recurrent costs. In \ncase  provinces  lack  funds  to  achieve  budget  norms,  MOF  may  allocate  additional  funds  from \nshared or central revenues.23  \n \n20. \nIn 2008, the Government did not meet the target for the recurrent health budget trigger \nfor  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategic  Operations  of  the  World  Bank  and  other  development \npartners  (para.  43).  The  share  of  total  recurrent  budget  actually  decreased  to  3.7%  of  total \nhealth spending in FY2008. Another trigger\u2014increase in staff in priority districts\u2014was actually \nachieved,  but  by  doing  so,  it  undermined  the  nonwage  recurrent  budgets  in  these  provinces. \nExternal  aid  also  ties  down  domestic  funding  for  infrastructure  projects,  and  may  lead  to \nreduced domestic funding as sector allocations are based on aggregate budget. MOH and MOF \nrealize the need to contain investment spending and are requesting help to bridge the recurrent \nbudget  gap.  Additional  sector  funding  is  expected  from  Nam  Theun  2  revenue.  Initially,  this \namount  will  be  small,  about  $1  million\u2013$2  million  from  FY2010  onwards,  but  it  will  become \nsubstantial from 2020. In addition, this money is not earmarked for recurrent budget support.24  \n \n21. \nExcluding  cost  recovery  and  aid,  domestic  financing  of  nonwage  recurrent  costs  was \nonly $1.6 million for all public health facilities in the country. Additional nonwage expenditures\u2014\nderived from cost-recovery, extrapolating data from a study in one province\u2014are estimated at \n$1  million  or  more  countrywide.  Some  recurrent  costs  under  external  aid  are  booked  as \ninvestment.  Excluding  provincial  hospitals  and  offices,  the  estimated  nonwage  annual  funding \ngap to operate district health services is at least $5.3 million. For comparison, if health care for \nthe poor were to be subsidized through health equity funds at a modest level of $3 per person, \nthis  would  cost  about  $3.5  million  for  17  provinces  per  year.  If  obstetric  care  for  pregnant \nwomen were to be subsidized, it could cost $5 million per year. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n22 Although some aid also pays for recurrent costs, all aid is categorized as investment. \n23 Technically, MOF redistributes provincial revenue funds among the provinces for equity purposes. \n24 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao \n\nPeople's Democratic Republic for the Greater Mekong Subregion Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nSince the introduction of cost recovery in 1995, the out-of-pocket cost of health care has \n22. \nincreased  substantially.  Transport  charges,  fees,  and  indirect  costs  of  health  care\u2014especially \nfor catastrophic illnesses such as obstetric emergencies\u2014are considerable and often prohibitive \nfor the poor. An emergency caesarean section may cost several hundred dollars if transport at \nnight  is  required.  Low  affordability  of  services  for  the  poor  is  considered  the  most  important \ncause of low use of services. Hence, MOH is considering mandating universal health insurance \nthrough  a  variety  of  schemes,  and  a  new  health  care  financing  strategy  is  being  prepared. \nCognizant  of  the  impact  on  MDGs,  several  development  partners  have  initiated  schemes  to \nsubsidize health care for the poor. Although health equity funds are quick to implement and help \nbuild up provincial capacity for managing health insurance, they are not sustainable. However, \nhealth equity funds are relatively cheap, and if government revenue is increased, they should be \nable to be sustained.  \n \n23. \nLimited resources are also not used efficiently, causing the Lao PDR health care system \nto  be  less  effective.  It  has  been  input-driven,  often  lacking  a  sound  public  health  rationale  for \nallocating resources. In recent years, efforts have been made to make planning and budgeting \nmore  results-oriented  through  the  introduction  of  strategic  planning  and  budgeting,  annual \nplans,  grant  in  aid,  and better  monitoring.  Projects  and  programs  in  the  absence of  an  overall \nprogram approach, however, have led to fragmentation of services. Projects and programs are \ntypically centrally funded and managed, are not well integrated or adapted to local capacity, use \ndifferent indicators and reporting and financial systems, and demand a disproportionate share of \nstaff  time.  Management  responsibilities  are  typically  segregated,  with  local  health  officers \nlacking  the  authority  to  make  adjustments  in  implementing  these  projects  and  programs \naccording to local needs and conditions. This imposes an additional burden on already stressed \nprovincial and district health systems. With MNCH, there is the additional problem of a multitude \nof pilots and packages, all with limited coverage. Hence, it is important that MOH sets national \nstandards for management and services and insists on harmonizing projects and programs. \n \nThe Government lacks a standard arrangement to implement policy and provide health \n24. \nsector-specific financing from the central level to the provinces. MOF and MOH are proposing \nthat,  to  implement  the  sector  program  approach,  a  fund-flow  modality  is  created  to  channel \nprogram  funds  to  the  provinces  and  to  provide  financial  incentives  to  improve  sector \nperformance. The annual planning and budgeting cycle will be the core driver to implement the \nsector  program  approach.  Provincial  health  offices  are  working  to  prepare  and  use \ncomprehensive  annual  operation  plans,  showing  past  performance,  proposed  sources,  and \nuses  of  funds.  These  plans  also  help  reduce  fragmentation  and  improve  provincial  aid \ncoordination.  Several  building  blocks  have  been  put  in  place  with  the  help  of  development \npartners. ADB has been supporting provinces with capacity building in planning and budgeting, \nand a countrywide health management information system has also become operational. ADB \nwill  further  support  provincial  and  district  financial  management  training  under  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n\n \nImproving  access  to  health  services  is  a  difficult  task  in  the  Lao  PDR,  given  the  low \n25. \npopulation  density,  rural  living  conditions,  and  low  salaries.  Health  centers  are  placed \nstrategically  to  maximize  access  for  people  and  providers  while  containing  costs,  using  a \ngeographic  information  system  to  balance  access  and  efficiency.  However,  it  has  not  been \nfeasible  or  cost-effective  to  provide  hospitals  and  health  centers  for  small  catchment \npopulations.  It  is  estimated  that  37  districts  have  around  25%  of  their  populations  living  more \nthan  a  2-hour  distance  from  a  hospital,  and  in  18  districts,  about  50%  of  the  populations  live \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nmore than 2 hours from a hospital. Moreover, the existing network is not operating as planned \ndue to serious resource constraints. It is estimated that one half of the health centers lack staff \nmembers,  and  most  facilities  face  serious  recurrent  budget  constraints.  MOH,  therefore,  is \ngiving priority to improving existing services, their impact, and efficiency, before expanding the \nnetwork.  \n \n26. \nAchieving MDGs 4 and 5 will depend on good village-level prevention and care, timely \nreferrals, and better maternal and child care at health centers and hospitals. The Government is \npromoting the concept of model healthy villages, which should help improve access to care at \nthe  village  level.  In  the  model,  villagers  take  responsibility  for  improving  their  collective  health \nthrough ensuring a healthy environment, nutrition, disease prevention, timely curative care and \nreferral,  and  social  safety  net  for  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups  including  adolescents \nand chronic care patients. MOH has approved a decree to pilot this approach.  \n \n27. \nAlthough  MNCH  services  are  available  at  most  health  facilities,  both  their  quality  and \nquantity  show  major  gaps.  Only  5%  of  type  B  district  hospitals  can  perform  basic  emergency \nobstetric  care.  All  provincial  hospitals  can  provide  complete  services  for  mothers  and  children \non a regular basis, but performance assessments have revealed that the competency score for \nproviders ranged from 51% to 84%, with the exception of active management of the third stage \nof  labor,  which  was  only  22%.  District  hospitals  and  health  centers  frequently  lack  specialists \nand midwives to provide needed care to communities. \n \n28. \nStaff salaries are in the range of $25\u2013$45 per month for civil servants at the operational \nlevel,25 insufficient  to  cover  the  living  expenses  of  an  average  family.  As  a  result,  health  care \nworkers  often  must  engage  in  secondary  occupations  to  augment  their  income.  Drawing  such \nworkers  to  rural  areas  is  difficult  due  to  lack  of  schools,  social  services,  and  higher  transport \ncosts.  The  Government,  with  support  of  Poverty  Reduction  Strategic  Operations,  has  started \nincreasing  salaries  about  15%  in  the  past  2  years,  but  given  the  very  low  base,  this  is  still \ninadequate  to  compensate  staff  members  in  rural  areas.  Therefore,  rural  staff  incentives  are \nbeing considered.  \n \n29.  Many  health  facilities  have  equipment  that  is  not  being  used,  yet  lack  essential \nequipment,  drugs,  and  other  supplies  to  perform  optimally.  In  a  survey  of  12  type  A  district \nhospitals  in  the  eight  northern  provinces,  five  hospitals  had  full  sets  of  basic  equipment,  one \nhospital had a full set of medium-range equipment, and one hospital had a full set of high-range \nequipment.  None  had  a  full  complement  of  31  basic  drugs.  Similar  deficiencies  in  equipment \nand drugs were found at type B district hospitals and health centers.26  \n \n30. \nTo improve MNCH services, MOH and development partners finalized the preparation of \na national strategy, identifying six challenges for achieving MDGs for maternal, infant, and child \nmortality  reduction:  (i)  insufficient  health  system  capacity,  (ii)  fragmented  responsibilities,  (iii) \nlack  of  investment  and  high  out-of-pocket  expenses,  (iv)  limited  availability  and  quality  of \nservices, (v) low access and use of services, and (vi) human resources constraints.  \n \n31.  MOH,  with  help  of  United  Nations  agencies  and  other  development  partners,  is \npreparing standards for MNCH targets, interventions, and resources at various levels. The plan \nis that MNCH-friendly health facilities are rolled out across the country, presuming a strong buy-\n\n                                                 \n25 MOF, Government of the Lao PDR. 2004.

This  is  not  without \nchallenges, due to lack of staff members and posting qualified staff members to remote areas. \nIn addition, ethnic groups are often reluctant to use services if staff members cannot speak their \nlanguage.  Training  students  from  various  ethnic  groups  to  become  PHC  workers  has  proved \nparticularly successful in bridging this social gap, and their skills will also need to be upgraded. \nIt also requires staff incentives and more operational expenses for supplies and maintenance. \nAchieving MNCH targets will require substantial recurrent budget support. \n \n32.  MOH is also considering making delivery care free to overcome the financial obstacles \nof institutional obstetric care. The total cost of all routine and complicated obstetric care amount \nto  about  $5  million  per  year.  One  option\u2014but  only  targeting  the  poor\u2014is  health  equity  funds, \nwhich  provide  an  existing  mechanism  for  paying  for  maternal  and  child  care  for  the  poor, \nincluding  transport  costs.  These  funds  are  being  piloted  at  the  village  level,  whereby  village \nhealth committees have funds for basic care and referral of the poor. Further improvement on \nthe demand for health services, including for MNCH, is expected from model health villages. \n \n \n \n33. \nAs  access  and  acceptability  of  services  improve,  the  quality  of  care  is  gaining \nprominence  as  a  determinant  of  suboptimum  health  service  utilization.  MOH  has  shifted  its \nhuman resources focus from increasing the quantity to improving the quality of its staff.  \n \nBased  on  an  in-depth  HRH  situation  analysis  in  2006,  MOH  indicated  a  need  for  a \n34. \nsystematic  approach \nthe  health  workforce. \nSubsequently, with support from a technical working group and ADB, MOH analyzed the health \nworkforce and prepared a draft national HRH plan, which proposed upgrading the workforce. As \npart  of  the  plan,  MOH  will  endorse  a  skilled  birth  attendance  development  plan  in  all  district \nhospitals,  and  train  a  minimum  of  one  person  per  health  center  in  basic  emergency  obstetric \ncare.  The  plan  will  also  set  standards  for  staff  performance,  remuneration,  education  and \ntraining, professional competence, and certification and licensing. The plan is being reviewed by \nstakeholders in MOH, other government agencies, and development partners. Its promulgation \nis expected by in 2010. \n \n35. \nTo achieve MDG 5, maternal mortality reduction, the number of staff members who can \nprovide skilled birth attendance must increase. Indeed, providing obstetric care at all health care \nfacilities is an important component of the national MNCH strategy. As part of the national HRH \nplan,  MOH  recently  drafted  a  skilled  birth  attendance  development  plan  to  create  a  skilled \nworkforce to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. It aims to train existing staff \nmembers  in  skilled  birth  attendance,  and  new  entrants  in  registered  midwifery  and  community \nmidwifery.  With  this,  MOH  plans  to  provide  comprehensive  emergency  obstetric  care  in  all \nprovincial  and  type  A  district  hospitals  as  well  as  basic  emergency  obstetric  care  in  all  type  B \ndistrict  hospitals  and  health  centers.  In  addition,  MOH  intends  to  train  a  minimum  of  one  \nhigh-level PHC worker per health center, and where needed, an ethnic group member, in basic \nemergency  obstetric  care.  MOH  lacks  funding,  however,  to  implement  the  skilled  birth \nattendance plan.  \n \n36. \nA number of studies have been conducted that found inadequate knowledge and skills of \nMNCH  service  providers  for  the  provision  of  accurate  information  and  appropriate  services  to \nclients,  despite  their  participation  in  several  in-service  trainings.  A  survey  among  health \npersonnel working in Oudomxay and Xieng Khouang provinces revealed that many health care \nworkers were unable to diagnose and treat common diseases. The core problem is thought to \n\nincentivizing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nbe  substandard  pre-service  training,  as  staff  quality  is  affected  by  the  substandard  level  of \nteaching  institutions  at  both  the  central  and  provincial  levels.  Education  of  the  health  care \nworkforce  is  undertaken  in  three  types  of  institutions.  Pre-service  training  for  high-level  staff \nmembers takes place at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane. The College of Health \nTechnology  in  Vientiane  provides  pre-service  training  for  mid-level  technical  nurses  and  \npost-basic  bachelor\u2019s  degrees  for  nurses.  The  Luang  Prabang  School  provides  pre-service \ntraining for high-level PHC workers. Mid-level technical nurses and PHC workers are trained in \nregional public health schools located throughout the country. There is no domestic pre-service \nor post-graduate training of midwives at present.  \n \n37. \nExcessive  intake  of  fee-paying  students,  lack  of  qualified  lecturers,  and  poor  skills \ntraining are some of the basic problems that affect these institutions. The number of fee-paying \nstudents is based largely on demand and the institutions\u2019 desire to generate income, with limited \nconsideration given to institutions\u2019 capacity. By 2008, medical sciences faculty had an intake of \n393  students,  compared  with  intakes  between  100  and  125  students  annually  from  2001  to \n2004.  The  College  of  Health  Technology  reported  that  80%  of  enrolled  students  in  technical \nnurse  training  were  fee-paying  in  2005;  in  technical  nurse  schools  in  Champasak,  Luang \nPrabang,  and  Savannakhet,  fee-paying  students  exceed  60%  of  total  enrolled  students.  While \nthis  trend  has  increased  revenue,  it  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  quality  of  training.  Poor \nstudents  unable  to  afford  fees  are  discriminated  against  by  price.  Without  a  system  for \ncontinuing accreditation of these institutions, the quality of the training has sharply deteriorated.  \n \n38. \nThe  quality  of  education  and  training  at  these  institutions  was  questioned  even  before \nthe added burden of overcrowding. These institutions lack qualified teachers, skills-focused and \nparticipatory  teaching  methods,  and  proper  facilities  and  equipment  such  as  laboratories  and \ncomputers.  Other  problems  are  the  low  level  of  basic  science  and  math  knowledge  in  high \nschool graduates, lack of opportunity for hospital and community practice, and lack of adequate \nplanning  and  supervision.  In  general,  these  institutions  do  not  have  a  strategic  approach  nor \nplan toward improving the quality of education. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n39. \nFollowing  the  Vientiane  Declaration,  MOH  has  moved  toward  a  sector  program \napproach.  The  Government  of  Japan  and  WHO,  with  the  help  of  JICA,  are  assisting  MOH  in \nsector-wide  coordination.  MOH  and  development  partners  have  agreed  on  a  coordination \nframework that is currently being implemented, and a national health sector program has been \nprepared  based  on  priorities  under  the  7th  Health  Sector  Development  Plan.  Sector  working \ngroups  have  been  established  at  policy,  operational,  and  technical  levels.  ADB  is  playing  a \nleading  role  in  the  HRH  working  group  and  participates in working  groups  for  health  financing \nand MNCH. A summary of external assistance and coordination is in Appendix 3.  \n \n40. \nUnder the Minister of Health\u2019s strong leadership, there is good alignment of development \npartner  investment.  ADB,  Lux-Development  S.  A.,  and  World  Bank  are  supporting  provincial \nhealth  services  and  health  financing  with  similar  interventions  in,  respectively,  the  northern, \nmiddle,  and  southern  provinces.  United  Nations  agencies  mainly  provide  technical  support. \nADB;  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement;  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and \nMalaria;  and  World  Bank  provide  complementary  support  for  communicable  disease  control. \nADB, JICA,  WHO, and World Bank also support HRH. The People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nand the Republic of Korea support hospital services.   \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nDonor Coordination \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, the Lao PDR\u2019s health sector has lacked domestic funding, and is increasingly \n41. \nfacing  a  paucity  of  external  funding  as  several  bilaterals  have  moved  out.  It  is  increasingly \ndependent on a few partners, including the Global Fund and Lux-Development. In the next 10 \nyears, the sector will continue to depend on substantial external support. Further, Nam Theun 2 \nrevenues will only become more significant after 2018.      \n \nThe  World  Bank  and  development  partners27 are  currently  providing  support  for  public \n42. \nexpenditure reforms. Public sector fundamentals are being improved, such as through the 2006 \nBudget  Law  and  ADB  support  for  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework.28 The  Ministry  of \nEducation and other ministries have pioneered the sector program approach with considerable \nuncertainty, but now stand committed to developing this approach further. It is now seen as a \nmore strategic and transparent approach with expected impact and efficiency gains.  \n \n43. \nPoverty  Reduction  Strategic  Operations  is  a  budget  support  mechanism  for  poverty \nreduction. Its framework includes a European Commission variable tranche of \u20ac1 million based \non two triggers: (i) recurrent health budget as a percent of total budget, with the share at least \nequal  to  the  baseline  (3.9%  in  FY2007);  and  (ii)  the  number  of  health  personnel  in  47  priority \ndistricts at least equal to the baseline (1,644 in 2007). As stated previously, the first trigger was \nnot achieved, as the share of total recurrent budget decreased to 3.7% in FY2008. The second \nindicator was achieved with an increase to 1,724 staff members in these districts. MOH noted \nthat while Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations puts an additional financial burden on MOH, \neven if triggers were met, there is no assurance that funds would actually flow into the sector or \nbe used for recurrent budget. \n \nAdditional  funding  to  the  health  sector  is  expected  from  Nam  Theun  2  revenue  from \n44. \nFY2010  onwards.  The  amount  and  use  of  these  funds  are  unknown,  but  the  amount  will  be \ndistributed  across  five  sectors  and  will  be  small  until  FY2020. 29 Estimated  revenues  to  the \nGovernment will rise gradually (while commercial debt service is paid) from about $7.2 million in \nthe first year (FY2010), to an average of about $10 million per year in the first 5 years (FY2014), \nto an average of about $15 million from FY2015 to FY2019, and increasing sharply thereafter to \nan  average  of  about  $40  million  from  FY2020  to  FY2024.  The  health  sector  is  expected  to \nreceive about an average of $2 million per year during the first 5-year period, FY2010\u2013FY2014. \nWhile revenues may help increase domestic financing in the health sector in the near to medium \nterm, MOH has not decided for what these funds will be used. These funds may be targeted to \nspecific, centrally funded priority programs like immunization and model healthy villages rather \nthan recurrent budget support.  \n \n \n \n45. \nADB  has  been  successfully  supporting  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  health  sector  in  three  areas:  (i) \nPHC in the eight northern provinces, (ii) MOH and provincial capacity building countrywide, and \n(iii) communicable disease control. ADB's Primary Health Care Expansion Project has just been \nclosed,  and  its  performance  was  satisfactory.  It  helped  improve  access  to  quality  PHC  in  the \neight  northern  provinces,  and  build  institutional  capacity  countrywide.  It  had  demonstrable \n\nLessons from ADB Experience \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n27  World Bank. 2007.

The  initial  target  sectors  for  the  first  round  of  revenue \ninclude  (i)  health,  (ii)  basic  education,  (iii)  rural  roads,  (iv)  environment,  and  (v)  the  poverty  reduction  fund. \nRevenue is to be used for specific sector programs and projects, but may include recurrent budget support.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n3. \n\nSector Program Approach \n\nimpact on the use of health services, such as doubling the number of institutional deliveries. In \ntotal,  almost  100  health  facilities  were  constructed  or  upgraded.  It  also  successfully  trained \nethnic group members as PHC workers and VHVs, and expanded drug revolving funds. While \nproject  implementation  was  relatively  smooth,  project  evaluation  identified  several  lessons \nlinked  to  the  low  use  and  underfunding  of  health  facilities,  including  staff  quality,  low  pay, \ninadequate maintenance of equipment, and inadequate outreach and support of VHVs, which to \na  large  extent  are  driven  by  constraints  addressed  in  this  HSDP,  including  low  recurrent \nspending and substandard quality of pre-service education.  \n \n46. \nADB's  Health  System  Development  Project  approved  in  2007  for  4  years  is  currently \nsupporting  MOH  in  improving  sector  performance  in  eight  northern  provinces  and  institutional \ncapacity  building  countrywide. 30  This  includes  the  preparation  of  the  7th  Health  Sector \nDevelopment  Plan  and  national  HRH  plan,  strengthening  provincial  health  planning  and \nbudgeting, management training, and piloting health equity funds and a results-based approach. \nProject implementation is mainstreamed through the relevant MOH and provincial departments, \nthereby  helping  build  their  capacities.  From  the  end  of  2009,  ADB  will  also  provide  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance to help develop detailed financial arrangements for the sector \nprogram approach and to strengthen provincial and district financial management.31  \n \n \n \n47. \nIn  line  with  the  Vientiane  Declaration,  MOH  wants  to  implement  the  7th  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Plan through a sector program approach. MOH has asked ADB to  help develop \nthe approach in the health sector with its development partners. In view of provincial and district \ncapacity constraints, a sector development program modality for the first program assistance in \nthe  Lao  PDR's  health  sector  is  considered  most  appropriate.  The  modality  supports  a \ncombination of policy reforms and recurrent budget support with accompanying investments and \ncapacity building to help implement the reforms. Drawing on lessons identified in the education \nsector, MOF and MOH are proposing a fund-flow modality that ensures that program funds are \nused in the health sector.    \n \n48. \nSuch an approach is considered in line with Strategy 2020 and the Operational Plan for \nHealth.32 The operational plan envisages a direct role in program-based support for health that \naddress  governance  and  public  expenditure  management  for  cost-effective  delivery  of  health \nprograms  and  services,  based  on  developing  member  country  demand  and  the  individual \ncountry  partnership  strategy  process.  Partners,  especially  Lux-Development  and  World  Bank, \nindicated their support for the approach and interest in future program funding. The Lao PDR\u2019s \nhealth  sector  makes  a  good  case  for  assistance  given  (i)  high  poverty  levels  and  MDG \nchallenges,  (ii)  strong \nfor  sector  reforms  and  aid \nharmonization, and (iii) a current paucity of domestic and external funding. ADB will support a \ntransition to new aid architecture in the Lao PDR's health sector to improve sector performance \nand to ensure that past investments are sustained. \n \n \n \n \n\nthe  Government \n\nleadership \n\nfrom \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB.  2007.

The  outcome  will  be  improved  use  of  PHC,  particularly  for  women,  children,  and  ethnic \ngroups. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  \n \n50. \nFollowing  the  Vientiane  Declaration  in  2006,  MOH,  with  support  of  WHO,  JICA,  and \nother  partners,  have  agreed  to  a  sector-wide  coordination  framework.  MOH  is  committed  to \nimplement part of the 7th Health Sector Development Plan through a sector program approach. \nThe HSDP is the first program assistance for the Lao PDR's health sector. It will focus on planning \nand financing, MNCH, and HRH development as a cohesive set of policy actions to address key \nconstraints in access to and use of health care, particularly for poor women, children, and ethnic \ngroups.  Although  the  HSDP  is  national  in  scope  to  help  create  a  countrywide  platform  for \nsupport, there is considerable variation in provincial financing, and the level of support under the \nHSDP will depend on annual assessment of performance and financing gaps. \n \n51. \nPublic  sector  financing  prospects  for  the  Lao  PDR  are  good  in  the  long  term.  Around \n2020,  domestic  revenues\u2014including  from  Nam  Theun  2\u2014will  be  substantial.  However,  in  the \nmedium term, the sector remains financially dependent on external funding. The HSDP presents \nbridge funding for this interim period. As implementation of policy reforms is partly shouldered \nby  the  provinces,  MOF  has  agreed  that  external  program  funds  will  be  passed  on  to  the \nprovinces as support for recurrent cost financing. The HSDP will support a fund-flow mechanism \nto provide supplementary recurrent budget support to the provinces, districts, and villages. \n \nC.  \n \n52. \nto MNCH care, and (iii) improved quality of HRH. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nThe program outputs are (i) strengthened planning and financing, (ii) increased access \n\nProgram Outputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Planning and Financing \n\n \n53.  MOH is developing the 7th Health Sector Development Plan as input to the 7th National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan. MOH\u2019s plan is results-based, being created and budgeted \nfrom the district level, and aggregated for each province to form provincial health development \nplans. Annual operation plans will be developed for each province for each year in the planning \nperiod,  will  estimate  the  recurrent  and  capital  costs  required  each  year,  and  will  provide  the \nbasis for securing program assistance for recurrent expenditures.  \n \n54. \nProvinces  will  be  largely  responsible  for  financing  the  downstream  costs  of  policy \nactions.  The  program  proceeds  will  be  used  to  provide  supplementary  budget  support  for  the \nprovincial  authorities,  essentially  helping  the  provinces  to  at  least  double  nonwage  recurrent \nspending.  This  will  be  done  through  results-based  supplementary  block  grants  for  recurrent \nexpenditures including, within certain budget norms, operational expenses, staff incentives, field \nallowances, maintenance and repairs, quality improvement measures, monitoring and reporting, \nand  funding  for  health  equity  funds.  These  health  equity  funds  make  health  care  more \naffordable  to  the  poor,  and  are  a  means  to  build  up  capacity  for  universal  health  insurance \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\ncoverage. It is anticipated that other development partners will also use the program financing \nmodality. The budget support is considered a temporary measure until government revenues\u2014\neither central or provincial\u2014increase. \n \nThe first policy action for the first tranche release is that MOF shall have approved the \n55. \nprogram funding mechanism for supplementary program support for the provincial health sector \nand  copy  of  such  Memorandum  of  Understanding  shall  have  been  provided  to  ADB.  It  is \nanticipated that development partners will use this mechanism to increase funding for recurrent \nexpenditures.  Recurrent  budget  support  will,  within  certain  budget  norms,  be  needs-based  for \noperation  and  maintenance,  staff  incentives,  and  health  equity  funds  for  the  poor.  MOF  has \nagreed to use the entire program funds of $10 million for non-salary recurrent budget support to \nthe  provinces.  The  second  policy  action  is  that  MOH  approves  the  national  health  information \nsystem  strategic  plan,  2009\u20132015.33 The  third  policy  action  is  that  MOF  shall  have  provided  a \ncommitment to ADB to increase the domestic nonwage recurrent budget for health by at least \n10%  annually  from  FY2010  to  FY2014  (Appendix  4).  While  as  a  proportion  this  increase  may \nappear high, the Government's recurrent health spending is still very low at less than $2 million \nper year, and the gap can be entirely financed from program proceeds. It is also expected that \nafter this period, other sources of funding will come on line. \n \n56. \nThe  first  policy  action  for  the  second  tranche  release  is  that  provincial  authorities  shall \nhave approved the results-based annual operation plans and budgets and copies thereof shall \nhave been provided to ADB. The second policy action is that MOH issues a decision approving \nstandards, guidelines, and terms of reference for district hospitals, and copies provided to ADB. \nWithout such guidelines, it is difficult to budget MNCH requirements for these facilities. The third \npolicy action is that MOF submits a letter to ADB confirming the increased domestic non-wage \nrecurrent spending by at least 10% compared to FY2010 level. At this time, it is expected that \nthe 7th National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011\u20132015) will have been approved, as \nwell as the health financing strategy, which are expected to mobilize additional program funding. \n \n\n2.  \n\nOutput 2: Increased Access to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n\n \nIn May 2009, MOH approved the national MNCH strategy, the first policy action for the \n57. \nfirst  tranche  release.  It  describes  health  system  strengthening,  and  mobilizing  individuals, \nfamilies,  and  communities  to  achieve  rapid  and  equitable  scale-up  for  delivery  of  essential,  \ncost-effective,  evidence-based  interventions  to  improve  MNCH  in  selected  districts,  monitor \nMNCH care, and ensure that district health plans adequately address MNCH care. The national \nMNCH strategy is initially costed at $6.2 million. As the first policy action for the second tranche \nrelease,  MOH  issues  a  decision  approving  the  rollout  of  the  MNCH  friendly  health  facilities, \nproviding  a  minimum  package  of  MNCH  services  and  a  copy  thereof  provided  to  ADB.  The \nexpansion of coverage of these qualified facilities will be a good indicator for access to quality \nobstetric  care.  A  major  issue  is  the  cost  of  obstetric  care,  and  MOH  is  considering  various \noptions to provide subsidized delivery care through a health equity fund or otherwise.  \n \n58.  Model healthy villages have emerged from the midterm review of the 6th Health Sector \nDevelopment  Plan  as  an  important  priority  for  achieving  MDGs.  A  healthy  model  village  is \ndefined  as  one  that  maintains  basic  conditions  needed  to  lead  a  healthy  life,  emphasizing \nMNCH, including nutrition. With support of a $3 million Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant, \nMOH  will  field  test  a  comprehensive  model  that  has  four  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  village \n\n                                                 \n33 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR.

A \nsecond  policy  action  of  the  first  tranche  release  is  Decree  No.  381,  approved  in  June  2009, \nestablishing the directives for piloting at least two model healthy villages per district in each of \nthe  participating  provinces  (about  300  in  total)  together  with  a  copy  of  the  supplementary \nguidelines on piloting model healthy villages. Using experiences from this pilot, a second policy \naction  of  the  second  tranche  release  is  that  MOH  issues  a  decision  approving  the  standard \nguidelines and strategic plan for the scale up and rollout of model healthy villages in at least 300 \nremote villages in the participating provinces by the end of 2015.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Quality of Human Resources for Health \n\n \n59.  MOH,  through  the  Department  of  Organization  and  Personnel  and  the  HRH  technical \nworking  group,  prepared  a  draft  national  HRH  policy  in  2009  with  support  from  ADB's  Health \nSystem Development Project (footnote 30). Approval is expected in December 2009. The plan \nsets  targets  for  workforce  size,  mix,  and  distribution;  staff  performance,  remuneration, \neducation,  and  training;  professional  competence;  and  certification  and  licensing.  The  plan  is \ncurrently being costed and includes the skilled birth attendance plan of $3.5 million to improve \nskills in maternal and newborn health care. The national HRH policy is to be issued by a Prime \nMinister\u2019s  decree  in  January  2010.  The  policy  action  for  the  first  tranche  release  is  that  MOH \napproves the national implementation plan for skilled birth attendance plan. The policy action for \nthe  second  tranche  release  is  that  MOH  submits  to  ADB  a  copy  of  the  National  Policy  on \nHuman  Resources  for  Health  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  plan,  once  approved,  will \ncommit the central and provincial authorities to finance downstream costs of staff upgrading and \nwages.   \n \nD. \n \n60. \nfinancing capacity, (ii) increased access to MNCH care, and (iii) improved quality of HRH. \n \n\nThe project outputs are coordinated with program outputs: (i) strengthened planning and \n\nProject Outputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Planning and Financing \n\n \n61. \nUnder  the  guidance  of  the  provincial  committees  for  health,  a  bottom-up  planning \nprocess will be supported. Provincial health management teams will conduct strategic planning \nexercises  to  improve  their  5-year  plans  and  prepare  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  to \nsupport basic public health functions. Based on these 5-year plans, district and provinces will be \nassisted  in  preparing  and  implementing  results-based  annual  operation  plans,  including \nbudgets.  The  Project  will  support  the  adaptation  of  guidelines,  standards,  and  procedures  for \nstrategic  planning,  budgeting,  and  management.  It  will  also  help  establish  the  fund-flow \nmechanism for program-financed block grants. It will set up a temporary financial control unit in \nMOH to support the provinces and MOF in the management of block grants to mitigate delays in \nthe release of funds, and conduct periodic inspections of the use of program funds. \n \n62.  MOH  has  established  clear  terms  of  reference  and  guidelines  for  health  centers. \nHowever,  similar  guidelines  have  not  been  established  for  district  hospitals.  Without  such \nguidelines,  it  is  difficult  to  budget  MNCH  requirements  for  these  facilities.  The  Project  will \nsupport MOH to prepare guidelines and terms of reference for district health offices and district \nhospitals.  These  will  contain  standards  for  organizational  structure,  personnel,  management \nresponsibilities, performance criteria, facilities, and equipment and drugs for district hospitals. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n63. \nUnder the overall umbrella of the national health financing policy, the Project will support \nthe  expansion  of  health  equity  funds  based  on  lessons  learned  from  ongoing  pilot  projects  of \nADB  and  development  partners.  The  recurrent  budget  support  can  also  be  used  to  operate \nthese  funds.  It  is  expected  that,  in  addition  to  the  three  provinces  under  the  current  Health \nSystems Development Project (footnote 30), an additional three to five provinces will establish \nhealth  equity  funds,  preferably  to  cover  the  entire  province  but  otherwise  the  poorest  districts. \nExpansion will be based on a firm commitment of the province to sustain the scheme from its \nown  resources.  The  major  challenges  for  scaling  up  health  equity  funds  are  (i)  financial \nconstraints,  (ii)  making  pilots  fully  functional  and  sustainable  at  the  provincial  level,  and  (iii) \ndeveloping standard health equity fund guidelines. The Project will support alignment with other \nhealth  equity  fund  schemes,  preparation  of  guidelines,  provincial  advocacy  and  capacity \nbuilding,  contracting,  and  training.  This  will  include  building  MOH  and  provincial  capacity  in \nhealth  equity  fund  management,  preparation  of  a  strategic  plan,  and  preparation  of  national \nguidelines  for  their  implementation.  The  Project  will  support  the  training  of  health  equity  fund \nmanagement  committees,  staff  training,  field  support,  fund  management  oversight  by  a  third-\nparty managing agency, and technical support required for health equity fund implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Increased Access to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n\n \nThe  Project  will  help  provinces  implement  the  national  MNCH  strategy  through  a  \n64. \ndistrict-wide  rollout  of  mother-  and  child-friendly  health  facilities  in  northern  provinces.  Priority \nwill be given to districts with high maternal mortality rates. MOH, with the help of development \npartners,  has  developed  minimum  standards  for  MNCH  services  and  has  drafted  an \nimplementation plan for district-wide advocacy, planning, upgrading, and recognition of mother- \nand  child-friendly  health  facilities.  The  Project  will  help  conduct  health  services  surveys  for \nimplementing  the  national  MNCH  strategy  in  northern  provinces  to  provide  a  baseline  of \nresources, services, and outputs. Funding will be provided for the use and provision of essential \nequipment at all levels based on need. The survey results will also assist provinces in seeking \nresults-based supplementary budget support for MNCH services under the program assistance.  \n \n65. \nCivil works are concentrated in the northern provinces, as Lux-Development and World \nBank  are  expected  to  provide  similar  support  in,  respectively,  the  central  and  southern \nprovinces. The Project will support upgrading of Boun Neua District Hospital from type B to type \nA  in  Phongsali  Province,  upgrading  Nam  Bak  District  Hospital  (type  A)  and  renovating  Vien \nKham  District  Hospital  (type  B)  in  Luang  Prabang  Province,  and  renovating  Mok  Mai  District \nHospital (type B) in Xieng Khouang Province. It will also support replacing a total of 10 health \ncenters  and  renovating  a  total  of  10  health  centers  in  Luang  Prabang,  Oudomxai,  and  Xieng \nKhouang  provinces.  All  civil  works  will  address  waste  management  issues  including  staff \ntraining. The Project will also support countrywide assessment, advocacy, training, and piloting \nfor the implementation of the national integrated health care waste management plan.34  \n \n66. \nThe Project will also support MOH to achieve its target of piloting model healthy villages \nin at least two villages per district in all provinces (a total of 282 villages) in the first 2 years, and \nfurther roll out the approach with at least proportional representation of small and isolated ethnic \ngroup villages. The experiences of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction pilot will be used to \nprepare standard guidelines and strategic plan for expansion. The Project will finance capacity \nbuilding of provincial and district health offices to organize, implement, supervise, and monitor \nmodel healthy villages, while program funds will be used to finance investment in the villages.    \n\n                                                 \n34 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2008.

However, additional regional training may be required. The United Nations Population \nFund  will  monitor  the  institutional  capacity  for  midwifery  training  including  facilities,  skills,  and \nequipment,  and  indicate  additional  funding  requirements.  According  to  the  skilled  birth \nattendance  plan,  the  Project  will  support  training  of  about  500  staff  members,  including \nobstetricians,  medical  officers,  midwives,  nurses,  medical  assistants,  and  PHC  workers.  The \nProject will support about one third of the projected in-services training in the plan up to 2012. \nImproving  skills  training  will  require  the  recruitment  of  regional  or  overseas  teachers.  The \nProject will use information from its health services survey to fill gaps in essential MNCH skills \nand equipment.  \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  also  begin  to  address  weaknesses  in  the  pre-service  training  and \neducation of health personnel who enter the health workforce. Sustainable improvement of HRH \nwill  require  institutional  strengthening  for  educational  institutions.  MOH  has  requested \nassistance to develop master plans for the University of Health Sciences and College of Health \nTechnology. This output will also provide teaching equipment and help upgrade teachers\u2019 skills. \n \nE. \n \n \n \nThe Government has requested that ADB support the Government's policy actions under \n69. \nthe HSDP by providing a program grant of $10 million from its Special Funds resources to be \nreleased  in  two  tranches  ($5  million  each),  with  the  first  tranche  to  be  released  upon  grant \neffectiveness, and a second tranche within 24 months post-effectiveness. The size of the grant \nis based on the medium-term costs of the proposed policy actions with an estimated adjustment \ncost  of  about  $15  million.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  pass  on  the  equivalent  of  the  $10 \nmillion program grant to the provinces as supplementary nonsalary recurrent budget support for \nthe  health  sector  for  operation  and  maintenance;  quality  improvement;  outreach  and \nsupervision; and rolling out mother- and child-friendly services, health equity funds, and model \nhealthy villages. \n \n70. \nThe two-tranche design ensures follow-up support for policy actions that trigger the first \ntranche.  In  determining  the  amount  of  the  grant,  the  following  factors  were  considered:  (i)  the \nscope and strength of proposed policy actions, (ii) minimum cost of a package of basic services \nfor the poor, (iii) short- and medium-term costs of proposed policy actions, (iv) fiscal constraints \nand associated financing gaps, (v) absorptive capacity of the provinces, and (vi) good prospects \nfor sustaining increased domestic health sector financing in the long term. The Government has \nalso  noted  that  additional  funding  is  expected  from  other  development  partners,  which  would \nallow further rollout of its priority programs for mother- and child-friendly services, health equity \nfunds, and model healthy villages. \n  \n \n \n71. \nsource of financing is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\nThe  project  investment  plan  by  component  is  in  Table  1.

MOH,  through  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  (DPF),  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  (EA)  for  the  HSDP,  responsible  for  overall  implementation  and  coordination.  An  MOH \nsteering  committee,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Health  and  comprising  vice  ministers  and \n\nHSDP Management \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nrepresentatives  of  MOH  departments,  will  provide  overall  guidance  in  HSDP  implementation. \nThe  MOF,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  other  ministries  will  be  invited  to  the \nsteering committee, as required.   \n \n74.  Within DPF, a project coordination unit will be established, with the DPF deputy director \ngeneral as director. The unit will include three deputy directors, two administrative officers, and \none  private  firm  for  accounting  services.  It  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  program  coordination,  (ii) \ntimely submission of policy measures, (iii) preparing and managing the project annual plan and \nbudget, (iv) providing guidance to national and provincial implementing agencies, (v) monitoring \nsocial and environmental safeguards, (vi) ensuring that ADB requirements are being complied \nwith, (vii) monitoring and evaluation, (viii) submitting quarterly progress and financial reports to \nADB, (ix) conducting reviews and surveys, (x) major civil works and procurement of goods and \nservices, (xi) hiring consulting services, and (xii) administrative and financial management.  \n \n75.  Within  MOH,  program  implementation  will  be  delegated  to  concerned  departments \nacting  as  national  implementing  agencies,  including  the  departments  of  Curative,  Food  and \nDrugs,  and  Organization  and  Personnel,  and  the  MNCH  Hospital.  These  departments  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning,  implementing,  and  reviewing  delegated  project  activities  within  their \nresponsibilities.  Provincial  health  offices  will  act  as  implementing  agencies,  through  the  PHC \ncoordination units and will be responsible for (i) supporting the preparation of annual operation \nplans; (ii) facilitating the processing and implementation of conditional grants; (iii) implementing \nprovincial  HSDP  activities,  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  these  activities,  including  training  and \nminor civil works procurement; and (iv) financial management of the HSDP.  \n \nAs per the gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10), gender and ethnic group \n76. \nopportunities  and  concerns  will  be  central  to  project  implementation.  Plans,  training,  and \nservices  will  address  the  special  needs  of  women  and  ethnic  groups,  and  reports  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender and ethnic group. An MOH gender committee will provide oversight to \nensure  implementation  of  the  gender  and  ethnic  group  action  plan.  MOH  will  also  appoint  a \ngender  and  ethnic  group  focal  point.  International  and  national  consultants  (i.e.,  gender  and \ncommunity  development  experts)  will  support  the  EA.  A  gender  specialist  in  the  ADB  Lao \nResident  Mission  will  provide  backstopping  and  also  help  monitor  the  implementation  of  the \nplan. Representatives from the Lao Women\u2019s Union and Lao Front for National Construction will \nfacilitate  participation  by  women  and  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities  and  participate  in \nsteering  committee  meetings.  Quarterly  progress  reports  will  provide  updates  on  the  effect  of \noutputs  on  women  and  ethnic  groups.  The  midterm  review  mission  will  consider  past  updates \nand make adjustments as necessary.  \n \n77. \nImplementation  period. The program period is from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2012. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013, and \nthe grant will close by 30 June 2014. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n78. \nProject  procurement.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procurement  plan \nwith  indicative  contract  packages  is  in  Appendix  8.  Works,  goods,  and  services  $100,000  and \nabove will be procured through national competitive bidding. Minor works, goods, and services \ncosting  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  through  shopping.  Vehicles  may  be  procured \nthrough  the  United  Nations  Office  for  Project  Services,  as  its  procurement  procedures  are \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n79. \nConsulting services. The Project will require five international consultants for a total of \n39  person-months,  six  national  consultants  for  a  total  of  71  person-months,  and  two  national \nfirms  for  accounting  and  architecture.  The  international  experts  in  program  management  (20 \nperson-months), MNCH (3 person-months), medical education development (7 person-months), \ngender (6 person-months), and health equity fund (3 person-months) will be hired as individual \nconsultants,  with  advance  action  for  engaging  the  planning  and  financing  expert.  Accounting \nand architecture firms will be hired using biodata technical proposal and consultant qualification \nselection. Other national consultants will be hired as individual consultants. All consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).   \n  \nAdvance  contracting.  MOH  will  take  advance  action  to  ensure  project  readiness  and \n80. \ntimely  implementation.  It  will  (i)  finalize  the  project  administration  manual,  and  identify  and \napprove key project staff members before grant negotiation; (ii) finalize and approve the terms \nof  reference  of  the  international  planning  and  financing  expert,  as  well  as  the  fund-flow \nmechanism  for  program  funds;  and  (iii)  initiate  the  bidding  process  for  goods  and  civil  works. \nContract with a firm will only be signed after the grant financing agreement is effective. Advance \naction  for  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  this  Project  or  to  finance  recruitment \ncosts.  \n  \n81. \nProgram  disbursement.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  released  at  grant \neffectiveness upon compliance of all the first tranche policy actions, and the second tranche of \n$5  million  will  be  released  after  24  months  upon  compliance  with  the  second  tranche  policy \nactions (Appendix 4). The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included on a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  (Appendix  5).  The \nGovernment  will  certify  if  the  value  of  the  Lao  PDR's  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is at least equal to the amount of the grant to be disbursed in a given period. ADB \nwill  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  grant  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment's  certification.  MOF  will  provide  an  equivalent  amount  to  the  first  and  second \ntranche,  respectively,  in  a  special  MOF  program  account  for  recurrent  budget  support  to  the \nprovinces during the next 2 fiscal years. The first set of policy actions is expected to be fulfilled \nby  October  2009,  and  the  first  tranche  release  is  scheduled  for  December  2009.  The  second \ntranche  is  scheduled  for  release  by  June  2012.  All  policy  actions  will  be  verified  by  official \ndocumentation provided by MOF and MOH. \n \n82. \nProject  disbursement.  Project  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each fiscal year, \nDPF will ensure that each participating department and province prepares annual reports, plans, \nand  budgets,  and  has  these  approved  by  the  MOH  steering  committee  before  any  funds  are \nreleased. MOH and MOF will ensure the timely release of funds.  \n \n83.  MOF  will  open  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  at  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR.  ADB  will \ndeposit  into  the  account  an  estimated  6  months  of  expenditure  or  10%  of  the  project  grant \namount,  whichever  is  less.  DPF  will  open  a  second-generation  imprest  account  to  manage \nproject  funds  for  MOH  at  any  bank  acceptable  to  MOH  and  ADB,  and  MOF  will  deposit  an \nestimated  6  months\u2019  expenditure  or  5%  of  the  project  grant  amount,  whichever  is  less,  in  this \naccount. The statement of expenditure procedure may be used in obtaining reimbursement for \neligible  expenditures  and  in  liquidating  advances  from  the  imprest  account  or  replenishing  the \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\naccount. This procedure applies to contracts of not more than $100,000 equivalent per payment \nand  to  the  liquidation  of  advances  made  from  the  imprest  account  according  to  the  financial \ncovenants  of  the  grant.  Detailed  arrangements  for  establishing  the  imprest  account  and  the \nstate of expenditure procedure will conform to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Adequate \nsupporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  must  be  kept  at \neach level of project management to substantiate all expenditures made with the grant proceeds. \n \n84. \nProject  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting.  The  EA  will  hire  an  accounting  firm  for \nfinancial management according to the terms of reference in Appendix  8. MOH and provincial \nhealth offices will keep separate records and accounts for the Project, identifying the goods and \nservices financed with the grant proceeds. The EA has implemented similar projects financed by \nADB and others in the last 10 years. Past experience and the results of the assessment indicate \nsatisfactory financial management capacity on the part of the EA. \n \n85. \nThe State Audit Organization or any other certified auditor acceptable to ADB will audit \neach year all accounts and financial statements, statements of expenditure and revenues, and \nactivities  in  the  imprest  account  related  to  the  Project,  according  to  auditing  standards \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, including the auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of grant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and use of the imprest \naccount  under  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  submitted  not  later  than  9 \nmonths after the financial year due to the difficulty of arranging audit in scattered field sites. A \nseparate  audit  opinion  will  be  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure. \n \n86. \nThe EA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within \n30  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  The  progress  reports  will  be  in  English  and  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  progress  made  against  established \ntargets,  problems  encountered  during  the  previous  quarter,  steps  taken  to  resolve  problems, \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  succeeding \nquarter. Within 3 months after the physical completion of the Project, MOH will submit to ADB a \nproject completion report with details of program implementation, accomplishments, outstanding \nissues, and proposed remedial actions.  \n \n87. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n88.  MOH has handled five ADB projects through the same administrative unit, which is now \nfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures  and  anticorruption  measures.  The  previous  projects  helped  set \nclear procedures for the procurement of equipment and civil works, with financial management \nsupport from a private accounting firm. There have not been any major audit issues or instances \nof  suspected  fraud.  MOH  will  ensure  that  (i)  staff  members  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy receive orientation; (ii) notice boards at the provincial health offices display \ninformation on contracts, list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\non  bidding  procedures,  contract  award,  and  list  of  goods  and  services  procured;  and  (iii)  an \nMOH  steering  committee  comprising  representatives  from  ADB,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Justice, \nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment  acts  as  the  grievance  redress  body  to  (a)  receive  and \nresolve  complaints  and  grievances  or  act  upon  reports  from  stakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds \nand other irregularities; (b) review and address grievances of stakeholders in relation to either \nthe Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect \nof the Project; and (c) proactively and constructively respond to them. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  four  hospitals  and  20  health  centers  will  be  upgraded, \n89. \nrenovated,  or  replaced  on  existing  government  land  free  of  encumbrances.  No  resettlement \nissues  have  been  identified  or  are  expected.  However,  these  assessments  will  be  confirmed \nduring  project  implementation  of  civil  works.  If  any  land  acquisition  or  other  action  is  required \nthat  affects  private  persons  and/or  users  of  the  land,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nto  guide  the  preparation  of  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (Appendix  11).  In  case  of \nany change in scope, the new site will also be inspected for any possible resettlement issues.  \n \n90. \nEnvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  through  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment.  The  Project  will  support  the  upgrading  of  four  hospitals  and \nupgrading or replacement of 20 health centers based on MOH guidelines for the construction of \nhealth facilities developed under the Primary Health Care Expansion Project (footnote 26). No \nsignificant  adverse  impacts  were  identified;  the  investment  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \nenvironment. The main concern is medical waste management. Most health facilities separate \nwaste,  but  the  subsequent  handling  is  inadequate.  The  Project  will  not  cause  any  significant \npollution,  health  hazards,  or  soil  erosion.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination,  in \nAppendix  12,  examined  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  and  identifies \nmitigation measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts and maximizes beneficial impacts. \nEnvironmental  implications  of  proposed  policy  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  no  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated.  Environmental  impacts  of  the  investment  component \nwere  reviewed,  and  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  were  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign.  Environmentally  sound  medical  waste  treatment  will  be  included  in  the  design  of \nupgraded  health  facilities.  Site  selection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work,  and  facility \noperation  will  conform  to  relevant  regulations  and  standards  of  the  Government,  international \ngood practices, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n \n91.  MOH is planning to roll out a plan to improve waste management in health facilities, and \nthe major challenge will be compliance with these guidelines, in terms of proper disposal of such \nwaste.  The  Project  will  support  the  Environment  Health  Division,  Department  of  Hygiene  and \nPrevention, MOH, to disseminate Decree No. 1706 on health facility waste management signed \nby the Minister of Health on 20 July 2004; health care waste management guidelines developed \nby  WHO,  adopted  by  the  Government  and  translated  into  Lao;  and  the  national  integrated \nhealth care waste management plan.  \n \n92. \nPerformance  monitoring  system.  The HSDP's overall impact, outcome, policies, and \ntargets are aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy results framework, as shown in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework.  The  HSDP  targets  four  out  of  eight  MDGs  directly,  and \nindirectly MDGs for gender, education, environment, and aid coordination. The HSDP supports \npillar  II,  Inclusive  Social  Development;  and  pillar  III,  Good  Governance  and  Capacity \nDevelopment.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nDPF  will  monitor  implementation  of  all  policy  actions  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix.  DPF \n93. \nwill submit to ADB quarterly reports until the completion of the HSDP that provide an update on \nthe status of government policy actions, both in formulation and implementation. Data from the \ncensus, household surveys, service surveys, and HSDP implementation reports and documents \nwill  be  used  to  monitor  progress.  The  national  health  information  system  will  be  used  for \nmonitoring health service performance, which will be supplemented with (i) impact and outcome \nassessment  using  the  Health  Systems  Development  Project  household  survey  scheduled  for \n2010  as  a  baseline,  and  an  HSDP  end-of-project  survey  in  the  fourth  year;  (ii)  annual  health \nservice survey including on village health care; (iii) monitoring of project activities and inputs; (iv) \nsocial  and  environmental  studies;  and  (v)  monitoring  of  project  management  and  financing. \nParticular  attention  will  be  given  to  monitoring  benefits  for  the  poor,  in  particular  women, \nchildren, and ethnic groups.  \n \n94. \nHSDP review. MOH will provide ADB with quarterly and annual reports on the progress \nof the HSDP and related policy issues. The reports should review progress milestones vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe  achievement  of  indicators,  identify  issues,  and  propose  adjustments,  as  needed.  Within  3 \nmonths  after  each  year  following  project  effectiveness,  MOH  will  submit  to  ADB  an  HSDP \nannual  report  summarizing  the  issues  related  to  HSDP  progress  and  compliance  with \ncovenants. The Government and ADB will conduct joint HSDP reviews, including midterm and \ncompletion  reviews.  The  reviews  will  focus  on  outcome,  activities,  inputs,  administration, \nprogram  reforms,  and  institutional  and  sustainability  aspects  including  aid  coordination.  The \nreviews will also examine compliance with social, environmental, financial, and other covenants \nin  the  grant  agreement.  MOH  and  the  provincial  authority  will  ensure  that  their  staff  members \nvisit the field often and join ADB in all review missions.  \n \n\nIV.  \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n95. \nSector  benefits.  The  HSDP  supports  the  implementation  of  the  6th  and  7th  national \nhealth sector development plans, and is aligned with the sector coordination work led by MOH, \nWHO, and the Government of Japan, with technical support of JICA. The HSDP advances MOH \nefforts in implementing the Vientiane Declaration by supporting a sector program approach that \nwill  serve  as  a  platform  for  sector  program  funding.  The  HSDP  helps  establish  a  fund-flow \nmodality  for  MOF  to  provide  external  program  funds  for  recurrent  budget  support  to  the \nprovinces,  thereby  providing  an  instrument  for  policy  compliance  and  improving  sector \nperformance.  The  lack  of  nonwage  recurrent  funds  is  a  key  constraint  in  sector  performance, \nand improving this will help better the quality of operations, maintenance, staff incentives, and \naccess  for  the  poor.  In  addition,  the  HSDP  supports  several  policy  reforms  that  will  help  the \nsector  focus  on  priority  areas,  in  particular  MNCH,  and  improve  staff  standards  and  quality, \nwhich will improve overall sector effectiveness, equity, and efficiency.  \n \n96. \nImproved  planning  and  financial  management  capacity  will  result  in  more  rational \nallocation of resources for recurrent costs and skills necessary to plan and monitor expenditures \nfor uninterrupted flow of funds. This fundamental planning and financial management capacity \nwill  make  management  more  technically  efficient  leading  to  cost  savings,  and  make  resource \nallocation  in  the  health  sector  more  efficient.  In  terms  of  sustainability,  the  HSDP  will  provide \nand  stimulate  critical  bridge  funding  until  domestic  health  financing  improves  to  provide  the \ncountry a head start in modernizing its health care system.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nEconomic  and  financial  benefits.  The  HSDP  supports  the  achievement  of  MDGs \n97. \nthrough cost-effective interventions targeting the poor, women, children, and ethnic groups, and \nwill reduce illness and premature death, thereby improving  productivity and income. Resource \nand  out-of-pocket  savings  will  result  from  increased  access  and  better  quality  of  services. \nProgram  funding  will  improve  overall  sector  efficiency  by  increasing  recurrent  operational \nspending  so  that  past  investments  will  be  preserved  and  better  used.  Improved  planning  and \nfinancial  management  capacity  will  result  in  greater  efficiency  of  health  sector  financing. \nProgram funding will also pave the way for aid harmonization that is expected to result in further \nimprovement of efficiency and impact in the sector. Overall, program investment is expected to \nincrease the number of people receiving good quality health care, and will contribute directly to \nimproving productivity of the beneficiaries.  \n \nEconomic benefits will accrue from reduced health care costs as a result of decreased \n98. \nincidence  and  severity  of  illness.  Benefits  include  (i)  cost  savings  due  to  improved  access  to \nefficient and effective health services, and (ii) increased income through reduced sick leave or \ntime spent caring for the sick. Cost savings may arise from (i) reduced costs of curative services \nas  a  result  of  improved  access  to  prevention  and  health  promotion  services;  (ii)  reduced  \nout-of-pocket  expenditures,  mainly  transport  costs  due  to  improved  access  to  health  services; \nand  (iii)  more  efficient  and  rational  diagnoses  and  treatments  that  reduce  treatment  cost.35 In \naddition,  gains  and  investments  in  women\u2019s  health  will  have  positive  impacts  on  reducing  the \ncountry\u2019s population growth rate, improving the health and welfare of children and families, and \nreducing  health  costs  and  contributing  to  poverty  reduction.  Details  of  the  economic  and \nfinancial analysis are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nSocial  impacts.  The HSDP will increase the access and quality of health services and \n99. \nimprove the health of the population in general, particularly for women, children, ethnic groups, \nand  the  poor,  and  thereby  help  achieve  MDGs.  Increased  recurrent  funding  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs  will  increase  accessibility  and  quality  of  health  care  services  for  the \npopulation  at  large  (and  women,  children,  and  disadvantaged  ethnic  groups  in  particular). \nIncreased  access  to  preventive  and  curative  care  will  lead  to  improvements  in  health  status, \nimproved  quality  of  care  to  reduce  the  number  of  treatments  and  recurrence  of  illness,  and \nbetter  access  for  vulnerable  groups.  Cost-effective  PHC  will  lead  to  decreases  in  maternal \nmortality, infant and child mortality, and general morbidity. Health equity funds will provide free \nhealth  care  services  to  the  poor  and,  as  a  result,  use  of  health  services  by  the  poor  will \nincrease, and equity in the distribution of health services will be improved.  \n \n100.  The  program  and  project  investments  will  provide  significant  benefits  for  the  poorest \ngroups, including improved health care for women, children, disadvantaged ethnic groups, the \npoor, and those living in remote areas; an increase in the number of deliveries done at hospitals \nand health centers; and increased use of health services and health care facilities by the poor. \nImproved  health  care  for  the  poor,  ethnic  groups,  women,  and  those  living  in  remote \ncommunities  will  result  from  increased  access  to  MNCH  services,  strengthened  planning  and \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  the  public  health  system,  improved  quality  of  HRH \n(particularly  skilled  birth  attendants),  and  expanded  health  care  financing  and  affordability. \nThese elements will ensure the reduction of maternal and child mortality and diminish the key \nconstraints  in  access  to  health  care  services,  especially  in  remote  and  rural  areas.  Quality \ncontrol  mechanisms  for  health  professionals  and  facilities,  through  provincial-level  annual \noperation  plans  and  guidelines  for  district  health  systems,  should  disproportionately  benefit \n\n                                                 \n35 Bloom and Choynowski. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nindicators \n\nthose with the poorest quality services and health workers. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n101.  Gender.  Despite  impressive  gains  on  key  health  outcomes,  there  are  wide  variations \nand  persistent  inequities  in  health  indicators  by  area.  Women  and  adolescent  girls  in  poor, \nremote, and ethnic group communities are particularly affected by the limited access to quality \nhealth services and lack of ethnically sensitive health staff members. Also, while the health care \nworkforce is predominantly female (58%), the majority of them are concentrated in medium-level \npositions.  MOH  aims  to  increase  the  proportion  of  women  in  higher-  and  lower-level  positions \nand ensure that all program activities are consistent with the provisions of the 2004 Law on the \nDevelopment and Promotion of Women. The gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10) \noutlines provisions and specific actions to ensure that women will receive access to resources \nequally. \n \n102.  Ethnic  groups.  Poverty  rates  and  health \nlag  substantially  among \nmarginalized ethnic groups. A 2006 survey found that most of the poorest women and women in \nmountainous  areas  delivered  babies  at  home,  compared  with  about  4%  of  well-off  women.36 \nLong distances to the nearest health facility and lack of transport, lack of qualified health staff \nand  equipment  in  health  centers  in  remote  areas,  and  lack  of  ethnic  group  health  workers  or \nthose  who  speak  relevant  languages  at  the  health  centers  and  district  hospitals  discourage \npoor, rural, and ethnic groups from seeking health care. Significant gaps remain in the staffing \nof health facilities in remote areas. The HSDP supports a number of measures to address the \ndeficiencies and inequities in the health care system, particularly through improvements in the \ntraining of ethnic group health workers and in the incentives and support provided to the health \ncare  workforce  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  These  are  integral  to  the  policy  matrix  and  further \nsupported and expanded on in the gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10). \n \n103.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  civil  works  were  reviewed,  and  no  land \nacquisition and resettlement issues have been identified or are expected. Civil works are limited \nto  renovation  and  upgrading  of  health  facilities  on  existing  government  land,  while  there  is  no \nknowledge of any squatters or other use of this government land. The summary land acquisition \nand resettlement framework is in Appendix 11. \n \n104.  Environmental  aspects.  The  main  environmental  concern  is  solid  and  medical  waste \nmanagement. Most health facilities separate waste but the subsequent handling is inadequate. \nThe Project will support MOH plans to roll out improved waste management in health facilities, \nbased on WHO guidelines. A specialized institution will advise MOH whether to use incinerators \nor  other  technology.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (Appendix  12)  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  have  been  prepared.  Individual \nsubprojects  have  been  categorized  as  environmental  category  C  as  environmental  impact  is \nconsidered  minimal.  However,  overall,  the  Project  has  been  categorized  as  environmental \ncategory B (non-sensitive) in view of its overall sector implications.   \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n105.  Program  modality.  The  innovative  nature  of  the  design  requires  a  buy-in  from  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners.  The  program \nfund-flow \nmechanism for the health sector is new in the Lao PDR, and requires agreement from MOH and \nMOF, and in principle, concurrence from partners. To date, full support has been confirmed. \n\nfunding  modality  and \n\n                                                 \n36 National Statistical Center. Government of the Lao PDR. 2007. Multiple Index Cluster Survey III. Vientiane.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n106.  Financial management capacity. MOH and provinces lack experience in implementing \nprogram  grants,  and  have  limited  capacity  in  financial  management.  Delays  in  preparing \nrelevant budget and expenditure documents in accordance with rules and regulations may lead \nto  delayed  recurrent  budget  support.  This  is  mitigated  by  project  investment  in  training  in \nplanning, procedures for accounting, auditing and financial management at all levels, use of a \nspecial account, and monitoring. \n \n107.  Fund-flow  mechanism.  The  fund-flow  mechanism  is  standardized  and  will  be \nimplemented in all provinces. However, each provincial authority will need to agree to this fund-\nflow mechanism to access the funds. Pre-project capacity development technical assistance is \nhelping set this up to ease the transition to the modality in each province. \n \n108.  Recurrent  cost  funding.  Domestic  public  spending  for  recurrent  costs  in  the  health \nsector is low, in particular low nonsalary recurrent spending at the provincial level (about 14% of \ntotal recurrent expenditures). Low recurrent funding undermines past investments and threatens \nthe operational viability of the public health system, especially at the lowest levels where poor \nwomen, children, and ethnic groups often receive care. Program funding mitigates this risk and \nhelps improve efficiency, equity, and effectiveness of services. \n \n109.  Sustainability.  Program  funding  will  help  bridge  the  financing  gap  until  Nam  Theun  2 \nrevenue  becomes  more  substantial.  Expected  revenue  allocations  to  the  health  sector  will  be \nabout  $1  million  in  2010,  and  gradually  increase  to  cover  a  substantial  part  of  recurrent  cost \nrequirements by 2020, if allocated as such. This will mitigate the sustainability risk of program \nfunding.  Expected  technical  efficiency  gains  from  increased  capacity  in  planning  and  financial \nmanagement will well-position MOH for approval of Nam Theun 2 proposals for future funding.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n110. \nassurances. which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nPolicy  adoption  and  actions.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  policies \nadopted  and  actions  taken,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  and \npolicy  matrix  (Appendix  4),  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  and  beyond  the \nprogram period. \n\nUse  of  program  grant  funds.  The Government will ensure that (a) counterpart \nfunds  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  the  program  funds  are  made  available  to  the \nparticipating  provinces  for  nonsalary  recurrent  budget  support  in  the  health \nsector,  and  will  not  be  used  to  pay  for  any  costs  accruing  prior  to  the  effective \ndate or for payment of electricity bills; and (b) the counterpart funds equivalent to \nthe  program  funds  are  completely  additional  to  the  nonsalary  recurrent \nexpenditures  accrued  in  FY2009,  in  real  terms,  for  the  duration  of  the  program \ngrant. \n\n(iii) \n\nProject counterpart financing. The Government will ensure that the counterpart \nfinancing  necessary  for  the  Project  is  provided  in  time,  and  that  MOH,  through \nDPF,  makes  available  all  funds  and  resources  necessary  for  construction  and \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  Project  on  a  timely  basis.  MOH  will  further \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\nensure  that  additional  counterpart  funding  is  available  to  cover  any  funding \nshortfalls that may occur during project implementation. \n\n \n(iv)  Resettlement.  MOH  will  ensure  that  in  the  event  that  any  resettlement  impacts \nare detected for an activity, (a) a resettlement plan for such activity in accordance \nwith  the  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is prepared; (b) resettlement plans are prepared \non the basis of the detailed technical design, disclosed to affected persons, and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval;  and  (c)  all  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance  is  paid  before  dispossession  of  assets.  The  summary \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  full \nresettlement framework and plan is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nGender  and  ethnic  group  action  plan.  MOH  will  ensure  that  the  gender  and \nethnic  group  action  plan  is  fully  implemented  and  that  all  project  activities  are \ndesigned  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) including, but not \nlimited to (a) 40% female participation in HSDP-supported training programs; (b) \ninclusion of equitable provisions relating to the MNCH, gender, and ethnic groups \nin  annual  operation  plan  and  budget;  (c)  inclusion  of  provisions  for  gender  and \nethnic groups for all targets relating to workforce and consumers in all guidelines, \nterms of reference, policies, master plans, strategies, and action plans developed \nunder  the  HSDP;  and  (d)  disaggregating  all  monitoring  and  evaluation  data  by \ngender and ethnicity. The gender and ethnic group action plan is in Appendix 10.  \n\nEnvironment.  MOH  will  ensure  that  the  construction  and/or  upgrading  of  all \nhealth facilities comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the Recipient, \ninitial  environmental  examination,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.  MOH  shall \nfurther  ensure  that  (a)  ADB  is  informed  if  the  construction  and/or  upgrading  of \nany  health  facility  requires  the  removal  of  hazardous  materials;  (b)  Decree  No. \n1706  on  health  facility  waste  management  and  the  national  integrated  health \ncare  waste  management  plan  is  disseminated;  and  (c)  health  care  waste \nmanagement  guidelines  developed  by  WHO  are  translated  into  Lao  and  are \nadopted  by  the  recipient.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n\n(vii) \n\nInternal  financial  control.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Internal \nFinancial  Control  Unit,  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  of  MOH,  has \nbeen  empowered  to  conduct  periodic  inspection  of  program  accounts  in  the \nprovinces and districts. \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Grant Effectiveness and Disbursements \n\n111.  The condition for program grant effectiveness is that all policy actions for the release of \nthe first tranche, as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4), will have been satisfied. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n112. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $10,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, for the program component of the Health \nSector  Development  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Program Grant Agreement presented \nto the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $10,000,000  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic \nfrom  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  for  the  project  component  of  the  Health \nSector  Development  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Project Grant Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n\n15 October 2009 \n\n C.

However, malnutrition remains high, \nand the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to spread.   \n \n2. \nFrom 1995 to 2005, the infant mortality rate reduced from 104 to 70 per 1,000 live births, \nand under age 5 years mortality has fallen from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births. Nearly half of \ninfant deaths (46%) are due to neonatal causes, and 60% occur in the first week of life. Many of \nthese deaths are due to the mother\u2019s poor health or inadequate care during and after pregnancy \nand childbirth, particularly among populations living in remote areas. By 2006, 70% of children \nunder age 1 year received immunization against measles, although there is some disagreement \nregarding  the  accuracy  of  this  figure.2  Fully  87%  of  children  under  age  5  years  sleep  under  a \nbed  net,  but  only  43%  sleep  under  an  insecticide-treated  net.3  Nearly  three  quarters  of  the \npopulation  have  access  to  clean  drinking  water,  and  nearly  one  half  use  safe  sanitation \nfacilities.4 Unmet demand for family planning is also a factor. \n \n3. \nThe maternal mortality ratio decreased from 650 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 405 \nper  100,000  live  births  in  2005,  among  the  highest  rates  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.5  The  most \ncommon \nlabors,  \npregnancy-induced  hypertension,  and  sepsis.  It  is  estimated  that  family  planning  has  the \npotential  to  reduce  maternal  deaths  by  25%\u201340%,  skilled  birth  attendants  by  13%\u201333%,  and \nemergency  obstetric  care  by  70%.  From  1995  to  2005,  the  number  of  births  attended  by  a \nskilled  birth  attendant  increased  from  14%  to  23%  (51%  urban,  10%  rural).  Women's  survival \ndepends  on  timely  access  to  quality  emergency  obstetric  care;  physical  access  to  hospitals \nwithin a 2-hour travel distance is still below 50% in rural Lao PDR. This is compounded by late \nreferral,  lack  of  qualified  personnel,  and  the  relatively  high  cost  of  transport  and  services. \nCoverage  of  antenatal  care  (at  least  one  visit)  rose  from  21.0%  in  2000  to  28.5%  in  2005. \nAccess to antenatal care is lowest in rural areas without roads (9%). Uptake of antenatal care \nalso increases sharply with women\u2019s education.   \n \n4. \nThe total fertility rate declined from 4.88 children per woman in 2000 to 4.07 children per \nwoman in 2005.6 The significant progress in modern contraceptive access and use suggests a \nremarkable  change  in  childbearing  behavior  among  women  in  the  last  decade.  Contraceptive \nprevalence  doubled  from  1994  to  2005.  By  2005,  38%  of  eligible  women  were  using  a \ncontraceptive method. However, rural access to contraceptives remains limited.  \n \n\nthese  deaths  are  hemorrhages,  obstructed \n\nimmediate  causes  of \n\n                                                 \n1  Committee for Planning and Investment, Lao PDR. 2008.

Information  collected  on  this  indicator  in  the  Multiple  Indicator  Cluster  Survey  (MICS)  III  indicates \nthat  67%  of  children  surveyed  had  vaccination  cards,  less  than  15%  of  the  children  had  all  eight  recommended \nvaccinations by age 1 year, while  measles vaccine by age 1 year was only 33%.  \n\n3  National Statistical Centre of the Lao PDR. 2007.

Most  mothers  give  food  supplements  to  infants  within  a  few  weeks  of  birth. \nChildren  with  better  road  access  were  found  to  be  equally  malnourished.9  Micronutrients \ndeficiencies  such  as  of  iodine,  iron,  and  vitamin  A  are  common.  According  to  a  2007  survey, \n37% of women of reproductive age and 41% of children under age 5 years are suffering from \nmoderate anemia (footnote 3). Forty-five percent of the children under age 5 years is shown to \nbe suffering from vitamin A deficiencies.10 Distribution of vitamin A capsules reaches only 29% \nof  children  under  age  5  years.  Twenty-seven  percent  of  school-aged  children  and  13%  of \nwomen  of  reproductive  age  are  found  to  be  at  risk  of  developing  goiters  or  other  \niodine-deficiency  disorders.  In  2007,  75%  of  households  were  using  iodized  salt  (footnote  3). \nMalnutrition in women not only undermines their health and opportunities but also increases the \nincidence and fatality rate of complications in pregnancy and childbirth.  \n \n6. \nCommunicable  diseases  still  cause  the  largest  burden  of  diseases.  Main  causes  of \nillness  are  diarrheal  diseases,  malaria,  measles,  and  common  respiratory  infections.  The \ntuberculosis prevalence rate has also not declined.11 While the HIV prevalence is increasing in \nthe  general  population,  it's  probably  decreasing  in  female  sex  workers  as  the  number  of  sex \nworkers  may  have  increased  in  recent  years  due  to  increasing  income  disparities  and  other \nfactors.  The  country  experienced  outbreaks  of  influenza,  anthrax,  cholera,  dengue  fever,  and \nother emerging diseases. Helminthiasis has a major impact on education and productivity.     \n \n7. \nData on noncommunicable diseases are limited. The burden of road accidents is high at \ntwice  the  rate  found  in  neighboring  countries.  Tobacco  and  alcohol  addiction  also  have  major \nimpacts on health, health services, and household incomes.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  is  responsible  for  health,  nutrition,  population,  and  rural \ndevelopment,  including  small-scale  water  and  sanitation,  and  also  coordinates  multisector \nprograms  such  as  those  for  HIV/AIDS  and  avian  influenza.  It  has  seven  departments:  (i)  the \nCabinet,  (ii)  Curative,  (iii)  Food  and  Drugs,  (iv)  Hygiene  and  Prevention,  (v)  Inspection,  (vi) \nOrganization  and  Personnel,  and  (vii)  Planning  and  Finance.  MOH  has  a  national  steering \ncommittee  for  health  that  oversees  all  MOH  activities,  including  projects.  MOH  also  operates \ncentrally managed priority programs linked to a specific MOH department and often also specific \ndevelopment  partners,  in  particular  for  maternal  and  child  health  and  communicable  diseases \ncontrol. \n \n9. \nBy  2008,  in  17  provinces  and  139  districts,  there  were  4  central,  4  specialized,  4 \nregional,  12  provincial,  and  126  district  hospitals.  Regional  hospitals  provide  a  wider  range  of \nspecialist  services  than  provincial  hospitals  and  are  also  centers  for  training  and  technical \nsupervision. Under each provincial committee for health of the provincial authority, the provincial \n\nSector Organization  \n\n                                                 \n7   Government of the Lao PDR and United Nations. 2009.

In  each \nprovince, a primary health care (PHC) coordination office under the provincial health officer has \nresponsibility for PHC activities.  \n \nDistrict  hospitals  serve  small  catchment  populations  of  10,000\u201350,000  people.  The  26 \n10. \n\u201ctype  A\u201d  district  hospitals  are  expected  to  conduct  surgery  requiring  anesthesia,  including \ncaesarean sections. The 100 \u201ctype B\u201d hospitals only conduct minor surgery. Under each district \nhealth committee, the district health office supervises health centers, the village health program, \nand other services like food security to ensure regular and good-quality service.  \n \n11. \nThe 789 health centers also serve small catchment populations of 1,000\u20135,000 people. \nThe  functions  of  the  health  centers  are  prevention,  health  promotion,  and  diagnosis  and \ntreatment of diseases within their capacity. Like hospitals, health centers manage drug revolving \nfunds  to  sustain  service.  Under  the  supervision  of  the  district  health  office,  the  health  center \nsupervises and monitors village health care providers, and coordinates between villages and the \ndistrict.  \u201cType  A\u201d  health centers  with  five  staff  members  are  headed  by  a  doctor,  and  \u201ctype  B\u201d \nhave three staff members headed by a medical assistant. One health center is a focal service \npoint for about eight villages.  \n \n12. \nThe  village  health  committee  ensures  a  healthy  village  environment,  adequate  village \nhealth care, and timely referral of emergencies. If more than a 2-hour walking distance from a \nhealth facility, the village will usually have a male and a female village health volunteer (VHV) \nand  a  drug  revolving  fund  with  a  drug  kit  containing  11\u201333  essential  drugs.  There  are  13,820 \nVHVs  and  5,668  villages  (54%)  with  drug  kits.  Members  of  mass  organizations  and  others \nvolunteer as peer educators for health and nutrition promotion. Village private providers include \nformer paramedics and traditional healers. All are expected to promote good hygiene (i.e., clean \nwater, food, body, clothes, and environment). In 2008, there were 285 registered private clinics \nand  2,118  registered  pharmacies,  mainly  urban.  There  are  also  many  unlicensed  drug  shops \nand a host of illicit private drug vendors that often sell poor-quality or fake drugs.  \n \nC. \n \nThe Government and MOH have emphasized equitable access to health services for all, \n13. \nespecially  the  poor  and  ethnic  groups.  Since  adoption  of  the  Primary  Health  Care  Policy  in \n2000, MOH has used PHC to expand its network of health facilities. MOH has tracked health-\nseeking behavior among wealth quintiles since 1999 to ascertain the impact of the PHC network \non  access  to  care.  VHVs  and  drug  kits  have  substantially  increased  access  for  the  poor  and \nethnic groups living in remote areas. Time series data from 1999 to 2008 in the eight northern \nprovinces  for  use  of  VHVs,  health  centers,  and  district  hospitals  by  the  poorest  quintile \ndemonstrate substantial increase in use of services by the poor.  \n \n14. \nAmong the poorest quintile, utilization of VHVs has increased significantly. In 1999, only \n3% of the poorest quintile sought care from VHVs. In 2008, nearly 33% of the poorest quintile \nsought care at VHVs. Access to high-quality drugs distributed by a person in the village who has \nreceived training in the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases has significantly improved \naccess to health services for the poor as well. A similarly dramatic pattern of increased care can \nbe seen for health centers, and to a lesser extent for district hospitals. Data on health-seeking \nbehavior in the second-poorest quintile demonstrate the same utilization trends.   \n \n15.  MOH  recently  rolled  out  a  new  countrywide  health  information  system  to  collect  health \nservice  statistics.  The  2008  series  in  Table  A2.1  is  the  dataset  since  time  series  data  are  not \n\nUse of PHC Network \n\n \n\n\f \n34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\navailable for trend comparisons. Reporting is probably incomplete, in particular for immunization \nand  skilled  birth  attendance,  as  the  data  indicate  even  lower  utilization  than  what  is  being \ncollected from household surveys.

In these samples, use of preventive health services still remains low. \nHowever,  in  the  eight  provinces  combined  and  in  four  individual  provinces,  there  has  been  a \ngreat  increase  in  coverage  of  all  nine  preventive  indicators.  Luang  Prabang  Province  showed \npoor performance, where only two indicators improved and two declined, followed by Phongsali \nProvince. \n \nD.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  overall  vision  for  the  health  sector  is  formulated  in  the  MOH  Health \n17. \n12 approved in 2001, and the Policy on Primary Heath Care (2000) \nStrategy up to the Year 2020\nthat  directly  addresses  the  MDGs.  Essentially,  the  Government  aims  to  achieve  health  for  all \nthrough  a  national  public  health  system  based  on  the  principles  of  PHC,  while  continuing  to \nprovide  services  financed  through  universal  health  insurance  and  local  and  central  revenues \nfrom various sources.  \n \nPublic financing of services will continue to be needed in rural areas given high levels of \n18. \npoverty  and  considerable  market  failure.  Capacity  for  service  delivery  is  also  limited  in  rural \nareas,  with  limited  potential  for  contracting  services.  However,  in  2009,  the  Government \napproved  a  new  law  for  nongovernment  organizations,  which  will  help  increase  capacity  for \nnonpublic services. It also encourages private sector development, and urban areas have seen \n                                                 \n12\n\nSector Plans, Policies, and Priorities \n\n MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2000.

MOH is also implementing the 6th Health Sector Development Plan, 2006\u20132010.\n The \nmidterm  review  of  the  plan  identified  eight  priorities:  (i)  healthy  village  development,  including \naccess  to  quality  health  care,  access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation,  safe  environment,  and \nhealth and nutrition promotion; (ii) maternal mortality reduction through birth spacing, antenatal \nvisits,  safe  delivery,  timely  referrals,  management  of  emergency  obstetric  care,  and  postnatal \nvisits;  (iii)  increased  child  survival  through  neonatal  care,  exclusive  breast-feeding  promotion, \nfull  immunization,  and  integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses;  (iv)  preparedness, \nprevention,  and  control  of  natural  and  epidemic  disasters;  (v)  human  resources  for  health  to \ndeliver  high-quality  care;  (vi)  organizational  and  management  strengthening;  (vii)  sustainable \nhealth care financing, including increased public financing for the health sector at all levels; and \n(viii)  creative  implementation  of  the  Vientiane  Declaration  for  Aid  Effectiveness  through \nownership;  aid  harmonization;  making  foreign  assistance  results-based,  efficient,  transparent, \nand accountable; and aiming to mobilize and efficiently use donor support.  \n \n20. \nThe  7th  Health  Sector  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014,  is  the  centerpiece  of  the  MOH \npolicy agenda for the next 5 years. The plan contains objectives, priorities, strategies, targets, \nand medium-term expenditure projections for each province and MOH that will be required for \nthe next 5-year planning period to meet MDG targets for health.  \n \n21.  MOH  has  prepared  a  comprehensive  national  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health \n to increase and integrate resources toward reductions in the maternal, infant, \n(MNCH) strategy\nand child mortality rates. The strategy focuses on health system improvements for both supply \nand demand issues, including MNCH leadership and management, access to quality services, \nnutrition  promotion,  and  social  mobilization.  MOH  will  gradually  roll  out  services  based  on \nMNCH standards for hospitals, health centers, and model healthy villages. \n \n22. \nThe  model  healthy  village  program  seeks  to  inculcate  community  ownership  for  the \nhealth  of  the  family  and  village  and  to  improve  the  village  environment,  family  health  and \nnutrition, and social protection within the village. MOH has issued guidelines for the piloting of \nthe approach in two villages per district. Along with other partners, ADB will support this through \n This will be followed by developing \na Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project of $3 million.\nstandards and a countrywide plan for rolling out model healthy villages. \n \n23. \nTo support the 7th Health Sector Development Plan, MOH has prepared a draft national \nhuman resources for health policy with support of the working group. The policy aims to develop \na professional health workforce that can provide high-quality services. It provides goals, guiding \nprinciples,  a  conceptual  framework,  and  strategic  directions  that  will  guide  human  resources \ndevelopment for the health sector, and includes a plan for skilled birth attendance; accreditation \nof teaching institutions; and regulations for licensing, continuing education, and recertification of \nhealth  professionals.  This  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  January  2010, \n\n14\n\n15\n\n                                                 \n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n  MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

Cost recovery was introduced in 1995 and modified in \n2007  to  address  resource  constraints  in  operating  services.  While  it  helped  improve  and \nincrease the use of services, the poor cannot often afford health services and related costs or \nresort to selling assets. Among others, MOH introduced health equity funds, which are showing \ngood  results  in  bridging  the  financing  gap  for  the  poor  and  creating  capacity  for  expanding \nhealth insurance. MOH is preparing a national health financing plan with three major objectives: \n(i)  achieving  universal  coverage  in  pooled  risk  social  protection  schemes,  (ii)  establishing \nmechanisms for sustainable financing of hospitals, and (iii) attracting private investment to the \nhospital sector.  \n \n25. \nThe implementation of past policies has varied considerably. Factors that influence the \ndegree  of  policy  implementation  are  the  level  of  national  and  provincial  priority,  availability  of \nfinancing, existing capacity, and coordination among levels and partners. A major issue is that \nMOH policy and financial leverage with provinces is limited due to the highly decentralized setup \nand tied to MOH leadership, goodwill, and externally financed projects. The expectation is that a \nnational  program  approach  can  pull  these  policies  together  and  provide  provincial  support  for \nimplementing them in the form of recurrent budget support.  \n \n26. \nProvincial  capacity  for  sector  reform  has  been  developing,  but  there  is  substantial \nprovincial  variation,  with  about  one  third  of  provinces  demonstrating  substantial  capacity  in \npreparing plans and budgets (e.g., Oudomxay, Xaignabouli, Xieng Khouang, Savannakhet, and \nVientiane  Province),  one  third  making  a  reasonable  effort,  and  one  third  clearly  being \nsubstandard.  It  is  noted  that  these  provinces  have  had  more  intensive  and  longer  external \nassistance, including support.        \n \nFollowing  the  Vientiane  Declaration  and  examples  in  other  sectors,  MOH  is  keen  to \n27. \ndevelop a sector program approach. With support from the World Health Organization and the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  has  been  assisting \nMOH with the establishment of a secretariat and aid coordination mechanism.16 It circulated the \ndraft terms of reference of the sector-wide coordination mechanism for health on 15 June 2009, \nand  the  expected  outcome  is  the  joint  formulation,  management,  and  monitoring  of  a  single \nsector program agreed on among MOH and development partners.  \n \nSector  working  groups  have  been  established  at  the  policy  level  (e.g.,  diplomatic \n28. \nrepresentatives),  operational  level,  and  technical  level\u2014including  three  technical  working \ngroups for PHC programs (with a major focus on MNCH), human resources development, and \nhealth financing. There are other working groups outside this framework, such as for HIV/AIDS \nand avian influenza, and discussions are ongoing on how to integrate these. A separate working \ngroup for health systems management and information system is being considered to address a \nrange of program implementation issues such as provincial administrative capacity building, the \nflow of funds, and annual operational plans. The identified priorities are being combined into a \nsingle sector program approach. The building blocks for this approach are summarized in Table \nA2.2.  \n \n\n                                                 \n16\n\n JICA.

The plan and its budget will be results-based. \nIt will produce a medium-term expenditure framework for \nthe health sector by province and program to meet 2015 \ntargets for the health sector. Current plans call for the plan \nto be completed by December 2009.   \nMOH has developed and pre-tested the methodology and \ninstruments required for annual district level results-based \nplanning and budgeting based on quantifiable targets. \n\nAll districts in the eight northern provinces and the \nmajority of districts in other provinces have been trained in \nresults-based planning and budgeting. However, planning \nand budgeting capacity needs to be institutionalized. \nDistrict health managers are provided certificate training, \nand provincial health managers receive master\u2019s degrees \nin public health.   \nThe strategic framework is formulated in the MOH Health \nPolicy and Strategy up to the Year 2020. The Primary \nHealth Care Policy (2000) and other policies provide \nstrategic direction. Specific policies and strategies cover \nall subsectors except for private sector development. \nPolicies outside the sector, including on decentralization \nand budgeting, also shape the sector.    \nA fund-flow mechanism has been agreed between MOF \nand MOH, allowing sector program funds to move from \nMOF to provincial and district levels.  \nThese have been standardized at the MOF.  \n\nCurrent Support \n\nWHO, JICA \n\nWorld Bank, JICA, ADB, \nEuropean Commission  \n\nADB HSDP, World Bank, \nLux-Development, JICA \n\nADB PHCEP and HSDP, \nWorld Bank, and  \nLux-Development support \nthe planning process, with \nADB also supporting the \nplanning and budgeting \ntools and database. \nADB HSDP, World Bank, \nand Lux-Development \nsupport the planning \nprocess. \nADB HSDP is \nstrengthening MOH and \nprovincial capacity.

The  net  increase  in  the  workforce  has \nbeen below 2%, which is below the population growth rate and implies that the national ratio of \n\nHuman Resources \n\n \n\n\f \n38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nhealth  workers  per  capita  has  fallen.  The  Government  gives  priority  to  improving  staff  wages \nand  quality,  rather  than  increasing  the  number  of  staff  members.  In  March  2008,  there  were \n12,013  active  personnel  employed  in  the  health  sector  workforce.17  Active  staff  members \nincluded 2,191 high-level (20%), 3,765 mid-level (34%) and 4,916 low-level (45%).18  Of these, \n29%  work  in  administration.  Staff  members  are  distributed  between  central  (19%),  provincial \n(33%),  district  (39%),  and  village  or  health  center  (10%)  levels.  Women  comprise  58%  of  the \npublic  health  sector  workforce,  but  only  40%  at  health  centers.  The  Lao  comprise  89%  of  the \nworkforce, compared to 65% of the Lao population.   \n \n30. \nOf  the  20,107  volunteers  or  village  providers  in  the  Lao  PDR  in  2005,  13,702  were \nVHVs;  5,241  traditional  birth  attendants;  540  village  health  practitioners;  and  624  traditional \nhealers. While not employed by MOH, these providers are seen as an essential element in the \ndelivery of health services, especially in remote and mountainous rural areas where travel from \nvillages to health centers is difficult. All VHVs, village health practitioners, and most traditional \nbirth attendants have had at least some short-course training by MOH. \n \nOn  average,  there  were  2.1  health  workers  in  health  centers  in  2005  compared  to  a \n31. \ntarget  of  3  health  workers  to  provide  care  and  outreach.  Twenty-three  percent  of  district \nhospitals  in  the  northern  provinces  did  not  have  any  medical  doctors  when  surveyed  in  2006, \ncompared  to  a  standard  of  four  doctors  per  hospital.  The  majority  of  staff  working  in  district \nhospitals  and  health  centers  is  low-level  health  workers  who  lack  necessary  skills  to  provide \nquality  care.  Redistribution  of  staff  members  is  difficult,  as  poorer  provincial  authorities  lack \nfunds to absorb them. In 2005, 39% of new recruits were placed at the central level.   \n \nPHC workers and mid-level technical nurses are trained in regional public health schools \n32. \nthroughout  the  country.  Concerted  efforts  have  been  made  to  improve  their  training  and  to \nincrease  the  number  of  ethnic  group  and  female  health  workers.  The  College  of  Health \nTechnology  in  Vientiane  provides  pre-service  training  for  mid-level  health  workers  and  post-\nbasic  bachelor\u2019s  degrees  for  nurses.  It  provided  direct  entry  midwifery  training  from  1987  to \n1990.  In  1990,  the  course  was  combined  with  nursing  and  upgraded  to  the  technical  nurse \ncourse in 2004. Graduates are expected to be multiskilled nurse-midwives.19 Pre-service training \nfor high-level staff members takes place at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane. The \nNational  Institute  of  Public  Health  and  the  Francophone  Institute  of  Tropical  Medicine  in \nVientiane provide some postgraduate training. Overcrowding of teaching institutions is common \nas more private students are admitted than can be provided with quality education; therefore, it \nwill  be  necessary  to  reduce  (fee-paying)  private  students.  Further  improvement  also  requires \nbetter facilities, teaching skills, skills training, coordination of training, and follow-up of trainees \nto support them in applying their new skills. \n \nF. \n \n33. \nSince  decentralization  in  2000,  MOH  and  provincial  health  authorities  independently \nprepare  their  budget  proposals  for  the  health  sector.  Provincial  recurrent  health  budgets  are \nclosely linked to the number of personnel assigned by MOH to both provincial and district levels.  \n \n\nHealth Planning and Financing \n\n                                                 \n17  Department of Organization and Personnel, Lao PDR. 2005.

Mid-level staff members have completed 3 years \nof  study  after  graduation  from  high  school,  and  include  nurses  and  medical  assistants.  Low-level  staff  members \nhave 2 years of vocational training, such as auxiliary nurses and primary health care workers.  \n\n19 However,  MOH  is  considering  splitting  nursing  and  midwifery,  which,  in  the  Lao  context  with  a  highly  scattered \n\npopulation and small hospitals, may be less optimal. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                            Appendix 2 \n\n39\n\n \n\nThe  allocation  of  nonpersonnel  components  of  the  recurrent  health  budget  is  driven \n34. \nmainly  by  what  is  left  after  paying  for  salaries,  previous  allocations,  and  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF)  budget  norms.  Health  facilities  mainly  finance  nonwage  recurrent  expenses  from  user \nfees  and  drug  revolving  funds.20  Depending  on  the  status  of  the  financial  management \nperformance  of  the  facility,  income  may  not  be  officially  retained  and  used  without  passing \nthrough  the  treasury.  Districts  may  also  receive  separate  support  for  recurrent  expenditures \nthrough  donor  assistance.  While  user  fees  and  donor  funding  supplement  nonwage  recurrent \nspending, it remains very low.   \n \n35. \nPerhaps the major challenge confronting the health sector to achieve the MDG targets is \nthe  extremely  low  level  of  public  financing.  In  2005,  government  health  spending  (i.e., \ndomestically financed and development partners) was about 1% of the gross domestic product. \nLow public health spending results in high out-of-pocket expenses by the population for health \ncare in public facilities (Table A2.3) and low use of health services, causing more health risks. \n \n\nTable A2.3:  Regional Spending on Health, 2005a  \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nCambodia Lao PDR Mongolia Thailand  Viet Nam\n\nExpenditure per Capita \n\nTotal Health Expenditure/GDP  \n\nPublic Expenditure on Health/Total \nGovernment Expenditure \n\nPrivate Spending on Health/Total Health \nSpending \n\nOut-of-Pocket Health Expenditure/Private \nExpenditure on Health \n\n$29 \n\n1.6 \n\n$19 \n\n0.7 \n\n$35 \n\n3.3 \n\n$98 \n\n2.2 \n\n12.0 \n\n4.1 \n\n11.0 \n\n11.3 \n\n$37 \n\n1.5 \n\n5.1 \n\n75.8 \n\n79.4 \n\n22.5 \n\n36.1 \n\n74.3 \n\n79.3 \n\n92.7 \n\n86.5 \n\n76.6 \n\n86.1 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People's Democratic Republic. \na Or latest available year. \nSource: World Development Indicators, online database, 2008. \n\nfor  developing  countries.

Total \nhealth  expenditure  per  capita  from  all  sources  in  2005  was  $19.60,  well  below  the  $34.00 \nrecommended  standard \nfinanced \ngovernment  health  spending  in  total  health  expenditure  was  9.7%  in  2005.  Generous  foreign \nfinancing  has  kept  the  share  of  government  health  spending  in  total  health  expenditure  at \n33.7%, with the remaining 66.3% coming from household out-of-pocket expenditures.  \n \n37.  Most  of  government  recurrent  spending  is  dedicated  to  salaries,  comprising  83%  in \nFY2007. Large expenditures in foreign financial aid may have created substantial inefficiencies \nthrough  an  excessive  focus  on  investment  without  adjusting  for  recurrent  expenditures. \nNonwage  recurrent  expenditures  by  the  government  comprise  only  17%  of  total  government \nexpenditures,  which  is  a  major  constraint  for  effective  service  delivery.  District  hospitals  and \nhealth centers primarily rely on small off-budget margins obtained from the sale of medicines to \npay for operation and maintenance.   \n \n\n                                                 \n20  Drug revolving funds are off-budget and are therefore outside the scope of the formal budget preparation process. \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAccording to government policy (Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 52 of 1995), the poor and \n38. \nseveral other groups (i.e., civil servants and their families, monks, and students in government \nschools)  are  supposed  to  be  exempt  from  having  to  pay  user  fees  at  government  health \nfacilities. In practice, however, few of these exemptions seem to be made. In a recent survey of \nthree northern provinces, for example, less than one third of 1% received free services from a \npublic health provider.21  \n \n\nTable A2.4:  Health Expenditure per Capita by Financing Source, 2005 \n(current $) \n\nExpenditure Per Capita \n\n \n\nFinancing Source \n\nGovernment (domestically financed) \nCentral Ministry of Health \nProvinces  \nDonors \nNongovernment Organizations \nHouseholds \nRisk Pooling \nTotal Per Capita ($) \nHealth Spending (%) \n\nDomestically financed (%) \nForeign-financed (%) \nHousehold-financed (%) \n\n1.90 \n0.45 \n1.45 \n3.70 \n1.00 \n12.90 \n0.10 \n19.60 \n \n9.7 \n24.0 \n66.3 \n\nSource:  Ministry of Health, Lao People's Democratic Republic; United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific, World Health Organization, International Labour Organization. 2008.

None  of  the  three  formal  health  insurance  schemes  (civil  servant  health  insurance, \nsocial security fund, and community-based health insurance), however, benefit the poor. These \nschemes, with a total coverage of less than 10% of the population, are not a viable option for \nmaking the services more affordable to the poor in the medium term. It will take a long time to \ncover the non-poor, given the current pace, capacity, use of services, and quality of care.22 \n \n40. \nHealth equity funds have been successfully pilot tested in a few districts to compensate \nhospitals and health centers for the \u201closs\u201d they incur when treating the poor. The fund currently \nis  being  tested  on  a  large  scale  in  Xieng  Khouang  Province  under  the  Health  System \n  with  two  additional  northern  provinces  scheduled  for  implementation  in \nDevelopment  Project,\n2009  and  2010.  World  Bank  is  pilot  testing  new  health  equity  fund  schemes  in  nine  districts \nlocated  in  four  southern  provinces.  A  standardized  system  for  health  equity  funds  and  a \nstrategic plan for expansion are necessary to build on these pilot tests to develop a countrywide \nsystem.  Health  equity  funds  for  those  who  cannot  afford  health  care  services  are  a  basic \nbuilding block for universal coverage. \n\n23\n\n                                                 \n21  Ministry of Health. 2008.

The  policy  level \nworking  groups  include  heads  of  delegation.  The  operational  level  working  group  consists  of \nrepresentatives of the departments of MOH and development partners. It meets twice a month. \nThere  are  three  technical  working  groups:  programs  (with  a  focus  on  maternal,  newborn  and  \nand  child  health),  human  resources  development,  and  financing.  There  are  other  technical \nworking groups for communicable diseases control, and a subgroup for monitoring. MOH and its \npartners are developing the sector strategic framework as the basis for program funding.  \n \nin  supporting  health  system \n2. \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR: the Asian Development Bank, the European Union (EU), Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Lux-Development,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO).  The  Global  Fund  for  AIDS,  Malaria  and  Tuberculosis  assists \nvertical programs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Joint United Nations Programme \non  HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS),  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  United  Nations \nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) focus on maternal, nenonatal and child health in the health sector.     \n \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  JICA  has  three  ongoing  projects  in  the \n2. \nhealth sector: (i) Capacity Development for Sector-Wide Coordination in Health (August 2007\u2013\nAugust  2010);  (ii)  Project  for  Medical  Education  and  Research  for  Setthathirath  Hospital \n(December 2007\u2013November 2010) to improve the quality of undergraduate clinical training and \nearly  postgraduate  training  at  Setthathirath  Hospital  for  graduates  of  the  University  of  Health \nSciences;  and  (iii)  Project  for  Human  Resources  Development  of  Nursing  and  Midwifery  (May \n2005\u2013May  2010).  This  last  project  aims  to  strengthen  the  technical  nurse  training  program  at \nthe  five  regional  public  health  schools  in  Champassak,  Khammouane,  Luang  Prabang, \nOudomxay, and Savannakhet. It has provided new buildings and teaching equipment for each \nschool,  assisted  MOH  to  prepare  a  ministerial  decree  on  nursing  and  midwifery  regulations \nsigned in 2008, and improved the quality of clinical instruction in the hospitals associated with \nthese schools. \n \n3. \nEuropean Union. The EU provides budget support to the Government of the Lao PDR \nthrough  Poverty  Reduction  Strategic  Operations  (PRSO),  which  is  financed  jointly  by  AusAID, \nEmbassy  of  Japan,  European  Commission,  and  World  Bank.  Funds  are  released  into  the \ngeneral  budget  when  policy  triggers  are  met.  In  July  2008,  under  PRSO  5,  the  EU  began \nproviding a variable tranche of \u20ac1.0 million (about $1.5 million) for the health sector. There are \ntwo benchmarks or triggers for the release of these funds: (i) increase in the recurrent budget \nallocation to the health sector, and (ii) increase in the number of health staff members working \nin  47  priority  districts.  These  funds  are  then  released  as  budget  support  to  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF). Achievement of these triggers are measured based upon a budget summary of \nallocations  to  the  health  sector  produced  by  MOF  and  made  available  to  PRSO.  The  EU  has \nsubsequent plans for PRSO 6 in March 2010 and PRSO 7 (date not yet determined). In addition \nto the triggers under PRSO 5, PRSO 6 will have one additional benchmark for release of funds, \ni.e.,  the  Government  adopts  a  health  financing  strategy;  and  PRSO  7  will  have  one  additional \nbenchmark, i.e., the Government implements a health financing strategy. The EU is prepared to \nprovide technical assistance to MOH to achieve these benchmarks. \n \n4. \nLux-Development S. A. Lux-Development commenced assistance to the health sector \nin  1996  when  it  constructed  Maria  Theresa  Hospital  in  Vientiane  Province.  Since  then,  it  has \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsupported  the  Clinical  Nurses  School  and  PHC  in  six  districts  surrounding  the  Maria  Theresa \nHospital; it has supported MOH\u2019s Medical Equipment Division, and it has provided vaccines and \nsupport to the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Lux-Development is preparing a \u20ac16.7 \nmillion  (about  $25.0  million)  project  that  will  (i)  support  health  system  development  in \nBolikhamxay, Khammouan, and Vientiane provinces; and (ii) support functional programs in the \nhealth  sector  including  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health;  human  resources  development; \nmonitoring and evaluation; asset management; and health care financing. It is being envisaged \nthat  this  support  will  use  a  program  planning  mechanism  at  the  outset,  with  the  possibility  of \nintroducing a program budget support mechanism in the future.   \n \n5. \nWorld Bank. The World Bank-funded Health Services Improvement Project commenced \nin 2005 in the nine southern provinces. One component of the project provides district grants in \naid.  The  project  covers  79  districts.  Support  for  districts  in  Bolikhamxay,  Khammouan,  or \nVientiane  provinces  will  be  transferred  to  Lux-Development.  The  fund-flow  mechanism  for  the \ngrants  is  as  follows:  (i)  MOF  transfers  funds  to  an  MOH  account,  (ii)  MOH  sends  quarterly \nadvances to the districts, and (iii) advances are replenished quarterly. The average size of an \nannual grant is $8,000\u2013$10,000. There is a complex, process-oriented formula for allocating the \ngrants to each district. A portion of Nam theun 2 revenue will be earmarked for the health and \neducation sectors to increase funding for recurrent costs. The fund-flow arrangements have not \nbeen finalized.  \n \n6. \nWorld Health Organization. WHO provides overall technical assistance in the sector, in \nparticular also in the areas of communicable disease control, maternal and child health, health \nfinancing, and health systems development. It also plays a key coordination role in the sector-\nwide coordination mechanism. \n \nUnited  Nations  Population  Fund.  UNFPA  focuses  on  reproductive  health  including \n7. \nbirth  spacing. \nIt  procures  contraceptive  supplies\u2014oral  contraceptives,  condoms,  and \nintrauterine devices\u2014for the entire country. It is also pilot testing a community-based distribution \nscheme in the provinces of Attapeu, Salavan, and Xekong. \n \n8. \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.  UNICEF  focuses  on  maternal,  nenonatal  and  child \nhealth, in particular also maternal mortality reduction and immunization. All vaccines in the Lao \nPDR  are  procured  via  the  UNICEF  procurement  system.  UNICEF  finances  the  vaccines  and \noperational  costs  required  to  implement  the  Expanded  Programme  on  Immunization  in  six \nprovinces. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A3.2: Major External Assistance

The plan identifies the health sector as one of four priority sectors \nand is committed to provide all with access to PHC to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and health for all. \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  2007\u20132011,  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)c is anchored in and closely aligned to the 6th Socio-Economic Development Plan. A results-based \nstrategy,  the  country  strategy  and  program  focuses  on  sustainable  economic  growth,  accelerating  progress  in  non-income \nMDGs, building capacity for good governance, promoting regional cooperation and integration as an engine of progress, and \nfostering  national  development  through  the  country\u2019s  own  strategy  and  plans.  The  Government\u2019s  health  sector  initiatives, \nincluding  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (the  HSDP),  are  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan, \n2009\u20132011.d  The  HSDP  is  also  included  in  the  areas  targeted  for  development  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership \nAgreement,  signed  on  28  September  2001,  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB  is  also  committed  to  support  the \nVientiane Declaration for Aid Effectiveness.  \n \nIn  line  with  the  priorities  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  HSDP  focuses  on  maximizing  past  investments  in  the  country\u2019s \nhealth  sector  by  helping  develop  the  national  health  sector  program  approach  to  improve  overall  health  service  delivery \ncountrywide in terms of effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and sustainability. The HSDP will support MDG attainment and PHC \ndelivery,  with  a  focus  on  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health  (MNCH);  planning  and  financing;  human  resources \ndevelopment; and expanded health care financing for the poor through health equity funds. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  Lao  PDR  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  A  small  domestic  market,  subsistence  nature  of  the  rural \neconomy,  skill  shortages,  and  remoteness  and  isolation  of  much  of  the  population  are  among  the  structural  factors \nconstraining growth and poverty reduction. However, the economy has grown and diversified in the last 5 years, based on the \ncountry\u2019s  natural  resources  base  for  hydropower,  mining,  and  tourism.  Between  2002  and  2007,  annual  growth  in  the \ncountry\u2019s GDP, at constant prices, averaged 6%. The sustained economic growth over the last 5 years has greatly contributed \nto a sharp decline in poverty. From 33.5% in 2003, the poverty incidence fell to 22.3% in 2007, which can be attributed to (i) \nsound macroeconomic fundamentals coupled  with prudent fiscal management; (ii) a decline  in the  unemployment rate from \n5.0%  in 2001 to 1.4%  in  2007; (iii) expansion  of hydropower, mining, and tourism;  and (iv) gradual  shifting of the  economy \nfrom agriculture to high value-added industry. From 49.8% in 2002, the share of agriculture to GDP has declined to 42.3% in \n2006  at  constant  prices.  However,  agriculture  still  provides  80%  of  national  employment,  and  about  79%  of  the  population \nlives in rural areas where livelihoods largely depend on this sector.  \n \nThe Lao PDR has a total area of 236,800 square kilometers, and two thirds of the country is mountainous. The country had a \nvery low population density of 25 persons per square kilometer based on its population of 5.6 million in 2005. The population \nis  composed  of  49  ethnic  groups  that  are  officially  recognized  by  the  Government,  and  which  are  grouped  based  on  four \nethno-linguistic families: (i) Tai-Kadai, (ii) Mon-Khmer, (iii) Hmong, and (iv) Sino-Tibetan. Ethnic minorities more often live in \nthe  mountains,  with \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  roads, \ntelecommunication,  water,  and  electricity)  and  transport,  more  so  in  the  north  than  in  the  central  or  southern  parts  of  the \ncountry.  Poverty  rates  and  health  indicators  are  lagging  among  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  In  addition  to  less  physical \naccess,  the  poor,  rural,  and  minority  ethnic  groups  face  lack  of  access  due  to  relatively  high  out-of-pocket  costs,  lack  of \nqualified health personnel in rural health centers, and lack of health care workers who speak the relevant languages. Village \nhealth volunteers, about two thirds of whom are male, have received short training and only deal with minor illnesses.  \n\nto  social  services  and  markets.  Rural  areas \n\nless  access \n\nlack \n\n2.  Design Features  \nThe  HSDP  will  provide  significant  benefits  for  the  poorest  groups,  including  improved  health  care  services  for  women, \nchildren, disadvantaged ethnic groups, the poor, and those who live in remote areas. This will be achieved by increasing their \naccess to MNCH services, strengthening the planning and financing capacity of the public health system, and improving the \nquality of human resources for health (particularly skilled birth attendants). The HSDP is expected to lead to an increase in the \nuse of health services by the poor, including more deliveries done at hospitals and health centers, a reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality, and improved health outcomes for the poor. Quality control mechanisms for health professionals and facilities, \nthrough provincial-level annual operational plans and guidelines for district health systems, should disproportionately benefit \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nthose  with  the  poorest-quality  services  and  health  workers.  The  HSDP  supports  a  number  of  measures  to  address  the \ndeficiencies  and  inequities  in  the  health  care  system,  particularly  through  improvements  in  the  training  of  health  workers, \nincentives for staff members in rural and remote areas, and support for model healthy villages and health equity funds. The \nHSDP will help increase the roles of the poor, women, and small ethnic groups in local planning, consultation, and decision \nmaking  achieved  through  representation  on  village  health  committees,  located  within  existing  village  development \ncommittees, and as village health volunteers and health staff members. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe policy reforms included in the HSDP are expected to have a variety of positive impacts for health consumers, especially \nthose in poor and remote areas.   \n\n(i)  The  preparation  of  annual  operation  plans  and  budgets  and  the  fund-flow  mechanism  to  provinces  will  improve \nsector management and are also building blocks for channeling program support to the health sector. They will lead \nto more efficient funding of key health sector needs, including to poor and remote provinces.  \n\n(ii)  The national MNCH strategy will address major impediments to achieving MDGs for reducing maternal, infant, and \nchild  mortality.  The  strategy  will  be  comprehensive  and  address  health  system  improvements  such  as  financing, \nmanagement,  leadership,  service  delivery,  and  health  workforce  as  well  as  demand  issues  that  address  efforts  to \nenhance individual, family, and community participation.    \n\n(iii)  Guidelines and terms of reference for personnel, facilities, equipment, and drugs required for provincial and district \nhospitals will help determine the optimum recurrent budget for these facilities, essential for addressing service gaps \nin rural and remote areas. \n\n(iv)  Guidelines  for  implementation  and  expansion  of  model  health  villages  will  support  the  Government's  priority \nintervention for achieving MDGs for maternal, infant, and child mortality and will particularly address current service \ndelivery gaps in rural, remote, and poor areas. \n\n(v)  The national human resources for health policy and national skilled birth attendance development plan will address \ndeficiencies in the health sector workforce that are recognized as major impediments to achieving MDG targets.  \n(vi)  The HSDP will support expansion of provincial health equity funds, which directly target health financing to the poor, \n\nand guarantee financing for MNCH services for poor women and minority ethnic groups.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Lao PDR lags behind on several nonincome MDGs\u2014life expectancy at birth is low (61 years), child malnutrition is high  \n(30%), and infant mortality (55 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality rates (350 per 100,000 live births) are very high \ncompared  with  other  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  One  third  of  the  adult  population\u2014and  nearly  half  of  all  females\u2014cannot \nread  or  write,  and  just  14%  of  the  population  has  completed  primary  schooling.  Diarrhea  continues  to  be  the \nsecond-biggest killer of children and the third-biggest killer of adults in the country. Malaria is the number one ranked cause of \nmortality overall, with 70% of the population at risk. The 2006 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey III reported that 40% of children \nunder  age  5  years  are  moderately  and  16%  are  severely  stunted.  Almost  two  in  every  five  children  under  age  5  years  are \nmoderately  underweight,  and  6%  are  wasted.  Some  37%  of  women  of  reproductive  age  and  41%  of  children  under  age  5 \nyears  suffer  from  moderate  anemia.  Forty-five  percent  of  the  children  under  age  5  years  were  observed  to  have  vitamin  A \ndeficiency.  \n \nWomen are key beneficiaries of the HSDP. About 85% of women give birth at home, according to the 2005 Lao Reproductive \nHealth Survey (footnote). Births assisted by health providers only marginally increased from 17.4% to 18.5% between 2000 \nand 2005. Sixty-three percent of births were assisted by family members or relatives, 12% by traditional birth attendants, and \n3% gave birth alone. There are distinct disparities between urban and rural settings: 51% of the urban population delivered in \nhealth facilities, while most of the rural population gave birth at home (87% with road access and 97% without road access). \nEarly pregnancy is also of concern, with an adolescent birth rate at 76 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 years old in 2005. Ten \npercent of married women had their first birth before they were 15 years old, and about 37% had given birth before turning 18. \nEarly pregnancy has severe implications on the health of physically immature girls. While there is awareness on danger signs \nof  pregnancy  and  childbirth  (e.g.,  bleeding,  lower  back  and  abdominal  pain,  and  baby\u2019s  breech  position  at  the  time  of \ndelivery), such knowledge is limited only among women who may have had two or more children.  \n \nSmall  ethnic  groups  account  for  only  one  third  of  the  country\u2019s  population,  yet  they  make  up  more  than  half  of  the  poor.  A \nfactor for the higher poverty rates among the ethnic groups is their places of residence, which are mainly in mountainous and \nremote  areas  with  limited  infrastructure,  government  access,  and  economic  opportunities.  There  is  a  shortage  of  qualified \nhealth workers at the district hospitals and health centers. In remote areas, health workers face difficulties in communicating \nwith health facility users due to language barriers.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                 Appendix 9 \n\n \n\n61\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe HSDP was designed following a participatory approach and involved consultations with national, provincial, district, and \nvillage officials; staff members at hospitals and health centers; village residents; development partners; and key informants. \nActivities included (i) visits to program areas to consult with and inform officials; (ii) interviews with villagers and health staff \nmembers; (iii) collection of data at all levels; (iv) resettlement, engineering, and environmental field visits and consultations; \n(v) meetings  with development partners; and (vi) a  workshop  with national and  provincial stakeholders to review  policy  and \ndesign issues.  \n\n  \n\nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation     \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \nWas a C&P plan prepared? \nThe  HSDP  design  incorporates  a  number  of  mechanisms  to  ensure  participation  by  a  wide  range  of  government  and \nnongovernment  stakeholders.  The  Gender  and  Ethnic  Group  Action  Plan  includes  several  measures  to  ensure  that  the \nconcerns of ethnic groups and women are represented in the implementation of policy reforms and related investments.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nPromoting gender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR, as reflected in the 1991 Constitution, Lao National \nGrowth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, 6th Socio-Economic Development Plan, and a number of the country\u2019s international \ncommitments.  The  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  was  established  in  1991  to  help  ensure  women\u2019s \nequal access to basic services and productive resources. The commission is responsible for implementing national strategies \nand reports directly to the Government, while the Lao Women's Union helps implementation on the ground.  \n \nWomen  in  the  Lao  PDR  remain  more  vulnerable  and  deprived  than  men  because  of  their  unequal  access  to  land,  food, \neducation, and health care, and their long working hours. While gender roles vary within rural communities, women from ethnic \ngroups  tend  to  be  the  most  disadvantaged.  Compared  with  men,  women  have  far  lower  average  literacy,  enrollment,  and \ncompletion rates, and education gaps widen at higher levels of schooling. In 2004, girls were 30% less likely to participate in \nupper-secondary education and 40% less likely to participate in tertiary education than boys. Although women own and operate \nmost  registered  small  businesses,  they  have  limited  access  to  market  information,  technical  training,  and  financial  services. \nWomen  are  key  beneficiaries  from  investments  in  health  care  as  they  are  primarily  responsible  for  taking  care  of  daily \nhousehold needs and family health. The choice of health practices, such as the location of births and use of birth attendants \ncontinues to be shaped by culture and tradition, decisions that frequently do not appear to reside with women but with their \nparents  and  husbands.  Early  marriages  and  early  child-bearing  ages  of  women  also  build  on  such  traditions,  which  have \nsevere implications for the health and well-being of girls whose bodies are not sufficiently developed to withstand pregnancy \nand childbirth. \n  \n2.

As  part  of  its  planned  restructuring  in  2010,  MOH  is \nconsidering establishing a gender unit for this purpose. It has established a gender committee, \nchaired by a vice minister and including representatives of its departments.  \n \nA  gender  and  ethnic  group  action  plan  has  been  developed  for  the  Health  Sector \n2. \nDevelopment Program (the HSDP) to integrate equity concerns in all program activities and to \nensure that women and ethnic groups have equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from \nthe HSDP. The plan is in accordance with current laws, policies, and regulations of the Lao PDR \nand the Policy on Gender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).

The \ngender  committee  will  monitor  and  provide  guidance  for  plan  implementation  and  will  be \nprovided  with  a  budget  for  quarterly  meetings  and  annual  workshops.  MOH  will  appoint  a \ngender  and  ethnic  group  focal  point  for  the  HSDP  to  ensure  that  all  gender  and  ethnic  group \nopportunities and concerns are addressed. Representatives from the Lao Women\u2019s Union and \nLao Front for National Construction, and from the Department of Ethnic and Social Affairs, will \nplay critical roles in facilitating participation by women and ethnic groups in project activities and \nwill  be  invited  to  participate  in  steering  committee  meetings,  as  required.  International  and \nnational  consultants  (i.e.,  gender  and  community  development  experts)  will  support  the \nExecuting  Agency  in  implementing  the  plan,  particularly  in  integrating  gender  and  ethnic \nconcerns  into  all  program  activities  during  implementation.  The  gender  specialist  in  the  Lao \nResident Mission will provide backstopping and help monitor plan implementation. The plan will \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nbe  monitored  as  part  of  the  overall  system  for  the  HSDP.  Plans,  training,  and  services  will \naddress  the  special  needs  of  women  and  ethnic  groups,  and  reports  will  be  disaggregated  by \ngender and ethnic group. Quarterly progress reports will provide updates on the effect of project \noutputs  on  women  and  ethnic  groups.  The  midterm  review  mission  will  consider  past  updates \nand make adjustments, as required. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n67\n\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\n2\n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (the  HSDP)  will  be  implemented  by  the \n1. \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  as  a  sector  development \nprogram including a Program and a Project. It will feature a comprehensive set of policy actions \nthat will address key constraints in access to health care services in the country, particularly for \nwomen,  children,  and  ethnic  groups.  An  accompanying  project  grant  will  finance  a  set  of \ninvestments directly linked with and supportive of the implementation of the policy actions in the \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH).  The  HSDP  is  designed  to  support  the  6th  National  Health  Sector \n1\nDevelopment  Plan\n  through  maximizing  past  investments  in  the  health  sector.  It  will  focus  on \nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  and  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health  (MNCH)  to  achieve  the \ncountry\u2019s  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)\n  and  will  help  develop  a  sector  program \napproach to improve overall health service delivery in terms of effectiveness, equity, efficiency, \nand sustainability.  \n \n2. \nCivil works covered by output 1 of the Project will involve upgrading four existing district \nhospitals  and  20  health  centers  in  the  provinces  of  Luang  Prabang,  Phongsali,  and  Xieng \nKhouang.  Although  no  land  acquisitions  were  identified  in  the  assessment  and  no  land \nacquisitions  are  anticipated,  MOH  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  has  prepared  a  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF),  as  an  expression  of  its  commitment  to  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  that  it  will  prepare  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan \n(LARP)  in  case  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  arise  from  civil  works.  The  LARF \nprescribes  the  approaches  in  LARP  preparation  and  addresses  the  compensation  and \nresettlement issues under the Project. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nAll  civil  works  have  been  screened  according  to  their  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and no issues have been identified. However, in case of any change of scope that \nmay  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  a  LARF  has  been  prepared.  As  per  selection \ncriteria  developed  in  the  program  preparatory  technical  assistance,\n  only  civil  works  with \ninvoluntary resettlement category B and/or category C will be considered in case of a change of \nscope. If resettlement impacts are unavoidable, the EA will submit a short LARP with the LARF \nbefore ADB considers the change of scope.  \n \nC. \n \nThe legal and policy framework in the LARF are built upon laws currently enforced in the \n4. \nLao  PDR,  such  as  Decree  No.  192/PM  and  Regulation  No.  2432/STEA,  and  the  relevant \npolicies of ADB, such as the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), its Operations Manual, and \nother related policies. The LARF will govern the LARPs that will be prepared under the Project, \n\nLand Acquisition and Processing Requirements \n\nLegal and Policy Framework \n\n3\n\n                                                 \n1\n   MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

Consistent  with  the  provisions  of  Decree  No.  192/PM  and \nRegulation No. 2432/STEA, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, all persons and entities \nwith or without land certificates and/or land titles are eligible to receive compensation. They will \nbe  identified  through  a  census  in  which  the  cutoff  of  eligibility  to  receive  compensation  and \nentitlement is the last day of the survey in civil works sites. The categories of affected persons \n(APs)  under  the  Project  are  (i)  legal  users,  (ii)  nonlegal  users,  (iii)  owners  of  houses  and/or \nstructures, and (iv) agricultural and nonagricultural laborers or employees.

One of their household members \nwill also be given preference for employment in civil works. Specific action plans for women will \nbe incorporated in the LARP. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n71\n\nIndigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups \n\nPublic Participation and Documents Disclosure \n\nF. \n \n7. \nCertain social groups that may be less able to restore their living conditions, livelihoods, \nand income levels will be identified under the Project. The EA will commit for special attention to \nindigenous  peoples  and  vulnerable  groups  like  the  landless,  poor,  households  headed  by \nwomen,  disabled,  elderly,  or  children  without  means  of  support.  The  specific  action  plans  for \nindigenous people and vulnerable groups will be defined in the LARP.  \n \nG. \n \n8. \nThe  HSDP  is  designed  to  encourage  participatory  approaches  that  involve  information \nexchange  and  decision making  in  the  LARP  preparation  process.  The objective  of information \nexchange is to allay the fears of APs about what may happen once the HSDP is implemented. \nThe  objectives  of  consultation  are  to  (i)  obtain  some  details  that  could  be  overlooked  during \nLARP  preparation,  (ii)  formulate  resettlement  options  that  balance  the  APs\u2019  needs  and \ncapabilities with technical requirements of the subproject, and (iii) help avoid unnecessary and \ncostly subproject development delay. A primer on the LARP translated into Lao will be furnished \nto  host  districts  and  villages  as  well  as  to  APs  and  stakeholders.  MOH  will  endorse  the  full \nEnglish version of the LARP to ADB for approval and for posting on the ADB website.   \n \nH. \n \n9. \nCommunications  with  APs  under  the  Project  will  be  designated  to  the  national  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) that will be created for implementing the HSDP. It will ensure that APs \nare  aware  of  the  procedures  in  filing  complaints  or  grievances  that  may  arise  during  LARP \nimplementation. A primer on the grievance and redress mechanism and appeals process will be \ndisseminated to APs during the detailed measurement survey. The PCU will assign a desk unit \nto  receive  complaints  from  the  APs  or  stakeholders.  The  resettlement  committees  at  the \nprovinces,  districts,  and  village  committees  will  also  serve  as  the  grievance  and  redress \ncommittees  in  each  level.  There  are  five  procedural  steps  for  the  filing  and  resolution  of \ngrievance  and  complaints  by  APs,  beginning  from  the  village  and  district  to  the  province  and \nunit. The last resort of appeal by the AP is the court of law that will render the final decision. \n \nI. \n\nManagement  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  Preparation  and \nImplementation \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\n \nThe  LARF  defines  five  areas  of  management  concerns  in  LARP  preparation  and \n10. \nimplementation. On the implementation arrangement, MOH will be on top of decision making. It \nwill create the PCU for the direct supervision and coordination with the resettlement committees \nin  the  provinces,  districts,  and  village  committees,  for  the  preparation,  review,  and  approval \ntoward implementation as well as internal monitoring and evaluation of LARPs. The training and \norientation  aspect  will  cover  the  orientation  and  workshops  for  the  preparation  stage  and  the \nimplementation stage of LARP. In both stages, the PCU will conduct orientation and workshops \nfor all parties involved.  \n \n11. \nThe voluntary donation of land is not ruled out in the HSDP, but in such a situation, the \nPCU  will  adopt  the  conditions  and  procedures  for  voluntary  contributions  that  have  been \nestablished in other projects in the Lao PDR, and will follow the process in accordance with the \nADB  Operations  Manual  (footnote  3)  and  Prime  Ministerial  Decree  No.  192/PM  (2005). \nDatabase management concerning information on all APs will be the responsibility of the PCU. \nAll data on APs will be computerized. On the review, endorsement and approval of LARP, the \nPCU  will  incorporate  comments  of  APs.  The  PCU  will  submit  the  LARP  to  the  provincial \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nresettlement  committee  in  English  and  Lao,  and  then  endorse  to  Water  Resources  and \nEnvironment  Agency,  for  approval.  The  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Agency-approved \nLARP will then be disclosed to the affected community and stakeholders, and submitted finally \nto ADB. ADB will place it on its website for downloading by the public. \n \nJ. \n \n12. \nThe  LARP  will  have  a  section  that  details  the  resettlement  budget  and  financing \narrangements. The budget will include the compensation at replacement cost, other allowances \nand  assistance  to  APs,  cost  of  replacement  cost  survey,  administration  costs,  monitoring  and \nreporting, and contingency allowance for unforeseen expenses and for cushioning the effect of \ninflation  during  LARP  implementation.  The  cost  of  the  LARP  will  be  borne  by  the  provincial \nauthorities. MOH will approve the budget for LARP and request the provinces for the release of \nfunds to the unit that will manage the compensation payments to the APs.    \n \nK. \n \n13. \nThe  primary  objective  of  monitoring  is  to  identify  as  early  as  possible  the  activities \nachieved and the cause(s) of constraints so that arrangements in LARP implementation can be \nadjusted.  Under  the  Project,  the  PCU  will  use  two  mechanisms  for  monitoring  the  LARP \nimplementation: (i) internal monitoring in collaboration with provincial and district health offices \nand village health committees, and (ii) external monitoring by an independent third party.   \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n14. \nThe  PCU  will  routinely  perform  internal  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nwith  results reported  to  ADB  on  quarterly  basis.  Related  information  will  be  collected  from  the \nfield  and  reported  monthly  to  the  PCU  program  director  to  assess  the progress  and  results  of \nimplementation,  and  adjust  the  work  program.  Internal  monitoring  will  apply  the  following \napproaches: (i) review of detailed measurement survey on all APs, (ii) consultation and informal \ninterviews  with  APs,  (iii)  in-depth  case  studies,  (iv)  sample  survey  of  APs,  (v)  key  informant \ninterviews, and (vi) public meetings with people in the community hosting the civil works.  \n \n15. \nThe  independent  third  party  that  will  be  hired  by  MOH  in  consultation  with  ADB  at  the \nearly stage of LARP implementation will (i) verify internal reports with APs as to the payments of \ncompensation  and  entitlements,  including  the  levels  and  timing  of  the  compensation;  (ii) \ninterview  a  random  sample  of  APs  to  assess  their  knowledge  and  concerns  about  the \nresettlement process; (iii) observe the functioning of the resettlement operation at all levels; (iv) \nverify the nature of grievance issues and the functioning of the grievance redress mechanism; \n(v)  survey  the  standards  of  living  of  APs  and  those  in  the  unaffected  portion  nearest  the  civil \nworks  sites  before  and  after  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  to  assess  the  effects  of \nresettlement to APs; and (vi) advise the EA and PCU regarding the possible improvements in \nLARP implementation. Substantial compliance on LARP implementation by MOH will justify its \nrequest to ADB for no objection on the award of the contract for civil works. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n73\n\nSUMMARY INTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA.  \n \nThe summary initial environmental examination (IEE) is based on the IEE prepared for \n1. \nthe  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (the  HSDP).  The  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  C) \nexamined the potential environmental impacts of the HSDP and identified mitigation measures \nto  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  to  maximize  beneficial  impacts.  Individual \nsubprojects have been categorized as environmental category B (nonsensitive) in view of their \noverall  sector  implications,  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  relevant  portion  of  the  Operations  Manual.1  Environmental \nimplications of the policy reforms were also reviewed and are summarized in this summary IEE. \nSince no significant impacts are predicted from those reforms, the IEE focused on the HSDP\u2019s \ninvestment  component.  This  summary  IEE  has  been  prepared  to  comply  with  ADB  guidelines \nfor sector development programs.  \n \nThe  IEE  was  prepared  for  the  proposed  improvement  of  four  district  hospitals  and  20 \n2. \nhealth  centers  in  the  northern  provinces  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR) \naccording to \n\n(i)  \n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003);  \nthe Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s Environmental Protection Law (1999) and its \nImplementing Decree (2002); \nthe Government's Regulation on Environmental Assessment (2000) and Decree \nNo. 1706 on Health Facility Waste Management signed by the Ministry of Health \non 20 July 2004;  \nhealth  care  waste  management  guidelines  developed  by  the  World  Health \nOrganization, adopted by the Government and translated into Lao; and  \nthe  draft  national  integrated  health  care  waste  management  plan,  prepared  by \nMinistry of Health (MOH) and consultants. \n\n \n3. \nConsultations  were  conducted  with  concerned  agencies  and  persons  knowledgeable \nabout  the  local  health  sector.  The  chief  of  the  Environment  Health  Division,  Department  of \nHygiene  and  Prevention,  MOH,  is  the  focal  point  and  is  responsible  for  health  care  waste \nmanagement  in  MOH.  It  was  disclosed  that  MOH  is  preparing  a  plan  to  roll  out  a  solid  waste \nmanagement  program  in  all  health  facilities.  MOH  is  proposing  that  the  HSDP  support  this  by \nensuring  that  all  construction  under  the  HSDP  is  implemented  in  line  with  its  solid  waste \nmanagement  program,  and  if  possible,  also  by  supporting  general  capacity  building  in  the \nsector. Potential grant assistance for technical support was also identified. However, this solid \nwaste management program still needs MOH endorsement.  \n \nSite  surveys,  assessment  visits,  and  public  consultations  were  conducted  in  the  four \n4. \nidentified  hospitals  and  a  sample  of  health  centers.  The  health  center  sample  was \nrepresentative  of  environmental  conditions  for  the  other  health  centers  to  be  renovated  or \nupgraded  under  the  HSDP.  Rapid  environmental  assessment  checklists  in  accordance  with \nADB  guidelines  were  accomplished  during  the  initial  site  visits.  A  situation  analysis  of  the \nproposed upgrading of facilities was prepared; data were gathered from physical inspection of \nthe  facilities;  and  interviews  with  health  care  personnel,  community  members,  and  the  public \nliving in the vicinity of the facilities were conducted.   \n \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2008.

In  these  construction  sites,  in  addition  to  the  proposed  improvements,  investments  will \nbe made as needed for adequate and safe water, sanitation, and medical waste management \nsystems,  including  appropriate  wastewater  systems.  The  Project  will  also  provide  equipment \nrequired for maternal, newborn, and child care in district hospitals and health centers, mainly in \nthe eight northern provinces in line with the sector approach and based on needs and sources \nof funding.  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Civil Works and Equipment Components \n \n \nDistrict Hospital \nCivil Works \n\nNo. of Health \nCenters  \n(upgrading) \n\n \n\nNo. of Health \nCenters \n(replacement) \n\n \n \nProvince \nCivil Works \nDistrict Hospital Type A  \nDistrict Hospital Type B to A \nDistrict Hospital type B \nRenovation \nHealth Centers  \nEquipment \nDistrict Hospitals A \nDistrict Hospitals B \nHealth Centers \nNo. = number. \nSource: Ministry of Health  \n\n  Nambak, Luang Prabang Province  \n  Boun Nua, Phongsali Province  \n  Viangkham, Luang Prabang Province \nMok-mai, Xieng khouang Province \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n140 \n\n \n \n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n10 \n\n \n\n8 \n34 \n \n\n6. \nADB support of facilities in the northern  provinces is complemented by support of Lux-\nDevelopment  S.

The  program  grant  is  $10 \nmillion  and  the  project  grant  is  $10.8  million.  MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  through  the \nDepartment  of  Planning  and  Finance,  while  other  MOH  departments  and  provincial  health \noffices will be the implementing agencies. The Project will be implemented with the support of a \nproject  coordination  unit  established  within  MOH  and  by  the  provincial  health  offices.  HSDP \napproval  is  expected  in  2009,  and  implementation  is  due  to  start  in  early  2010.  It  is  to  be \nimplemented over a 4-year period, concluding in 2014. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nMost Lao PDR hospitals\u2014and almost all health centers\u2014in the northern provinces are \nlocated  in  low  population-density  areas  across  hilly  and  mountainous  terrain,  which  are \nconnected through a system of winding, paved and unpaved roads. Many of the remote health \ncenters are not accessible by main road connections. Reaching them can take a few hours of \ntravel by footpaths and trails, less with the use of motorbikes. The project district hospitals and \nhealth  centers  to  be  upgraded,  improved,  or  replaced  are  not  situated  within  environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  None  of  the  district  hospitals  and  health  centers  proposed  for  upgrading  and \nimprovement is known to be closer than 20 kilometers to the periphery of these areas.  \n \nThe districts comprising the service population of the district hospitals and health centers \n9. \nrange in population from 12,000 to 65,000, implying a low volume of services. Livelihoods are \npredominantly based on agriculture or forest products, although the manufacturing and services \nsectors  are  growing.  Economic  development  and  population  growth  are  occurring,  with \nconsequently increasing\u2014but still modest\u2014demands on health services and infrastructure.  \n \n10. \nSanitation  infrastructure  in  most  districts  and  villages  is  basic,  but  coverage  is  high. \nHouseholds typically construct pit latrines. In the low- and medium-density conditions that typify \nmost small villages, these are usually appropriate and adequate for the disposal of wastewater \nand household sullage. Septic tanks, where used, are often inadequately designed, constructed, \nor regularly emptied. Public sanitation facilities are rarely installed. \n \nSolid  waste  generation  is  currently  increasing  with  economic  activity,  particularly  with \n11. \nmore  trade  in  goods  packaged  in  various  forms  of  plastic  containers.  Some  districts  have \ncollection systems, but none have appropriate disposal facilities. Collection systems are rarely \nadequate to collect refuse on a regular, thorough basis. Very little recycling and composting of \nsolid  waste  takes  place.  The  same  situation  occurs  in  hospitals  and  health  facilities  where \nseparation  of  nonhazardous  and  hazardous  wastes  is  commonly  practiced,  but  not  followed \nthrough with proper storage, collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal. \n \nThe  districts  and  villages  are  impaired  by  poor  drainage  and  indiscriminate  littering  of \n12. \nsolid  waste.  Many  district  and  village  roads  remain  unpaved  and  dusty,  with  poor  surface \ntreatment and appear not to benefit from a regular repair and maintenance program. The main \nroads  are  lined  with  open  canals  or  lined  trench  drains,  which  are  poorly  kept  and  frequently \nblocked. Blocked drains and puddles provide habitats for insect disease vectors. Data show that \nthe  most  common  diseases  such  as  cholera,  diarrhea,  dysentery,  and  hepatitis\u2014related  to \npoor-quality drinking water and hygiene\u2014and dengue fever are attributable to the presence of \nstagnant water.  \n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n13. \nPositive  impacts  are  expected  to  arise  from  the  subproject  improvements  in  health \nfacilities and increased access to health services for women, children, and ethnic groups. The \nupgrading  and  improvement  projects  will  enhance  public  health  and  the  quality  of  health  care \nmade  available  at  the  district  and  village  service  areas.  They  address  priority  problems  that \nwould otherwise hinder health sector development.   \n \nSome  items  of  potential  concern  may  occur  in  connection  with  subproject  location  and \n14. \ndesign, the construction phase, and operation phase. The main environmental concern is solid \nwaste  management.  This  is  not so much  a  result  of  upgrading,  but  a preexisting problem  that \nmay increase in importance with the increased use of services. The upgrading creates a good \nopportunity  to  address  this  problem,  in  line  with  government  plans.  Other  issues  are  (i) \nwastewater  management,  (ii)  an  increased  burden  on  drainage  systems  due  to  upgrades  of \nservice facilities, and (iii) an increased burden on water supply sources. \n \nAs construction will only be concerned with upgrading existing premises, only minor local \n15. \nand temporary negative impacts are expected during the construction phase, in particular some \nnoise,  dust,  deterioration  of  water  quality  through  sediment  laden  runoff  or  improper  waste \ndisposal,  and  added  breading  sites  for  mosquitoes.  These  can  be  readily  managed  to \nacceptable levels through implementation of standard construction environmental management \npractices. Occupational health and safety standards must also be followed. \n \n16. \nProject  design  for  upgrading  of  each  facility  will  incorporate  (i)  improved  drainage  and \nsanitation  conditions  in  the  hospital  and  health  center  facilities,  (ii)  behavioral  changes  in \nsanitation practices and raised awareness of sanitation and health, (iii) improvements to public \nsanitation facilities and drainage, and (iv) enhanced capacity of hospital and health center staff \nmembers  to  manage  solid  waste  and  sanitation  through  capacity  building  and  supply  of \noperation and maintenance equipment.  \n \n17.  MOH  will  be  advised  to  implement  the  establish  policies,  plans,  and  procedures,  and \nnational integrated health care waste management plan. This plan will establish the standards \nbased  on  the  Lao  PDR's  current  environmental  protection  law,  its  implementing  rules  and \nregulations, and World Health Organization standards in health care waste management. It will \nbe implemented at different levels for provincial, district, and health center applications. Health \ncare waste management will be incorporated into operational manuals for health facilities, and \npersonnel will be regularly trained on the implementation of correct practices.  \n \n18. \nTable A12.3. \n\nEnvironmental  impact  and  mitigating  actions  of  program  policies  are  summarized  in \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n77\n\nTable A12.3: Environmental Impact and Mitigating Actions of Program Policies \n \n\nPolicy Measures \n\nPositive/Negative Impacts \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nA.

During  preparation  of  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  reference  will  be  made  to  the  plans  containing  relevant  site-specific \nmitigation measures for inclusion in the environmental management plan.  \n\nfor \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Responsibility \n\n \n20. \nThe  project  coordination  unit  in  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  will  be \nresponsible for the implementation of the environmental safeguards in the HSDP. It will ensure \nadequate  consultation  with  representatives  from  central-level  agencies,  including  the  Water \nResources  and  Environment  Agency  as  the  environmental  regulatory  agency.  It  will  delegate \nimplementation  of  policy  actions  to  the  Environment  Health  Division,  Department  of  Hygiene \nand  Prevention,  as  the  focal  point  for  improving  health  care  waste  management  in  MOH,  and \nprovide this office support for dissemination through workshops, training, and pilots of the new \nMOH standards and guidelines on waste management.  \n \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe  main  environmental  responsibility  resides  in  provincial  health  offices,  which  are \n21. \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  and  preparing  for  IEEs  in  accordance  with  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  prepared  for  the  HSDP.  These  offices  will  also  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  during  detailed \ndesign  and  construction,  with  overall  guidance  from  the  project  coordination  unit.  During \noperation, responsibility for environmental management plan implementation rests primarily with \nthe  MOH-designated  environmental  unit  to  handle  sanitation,  health  care  waste  management, \nand wastewater management.   \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nAn environmental management budget to cover costs for management and monitoring at \n\n \n22.  Main  environmental  monitoring  includes  compliance  monitoring;  community  feedback; \nand  health  care  waste,  sanitation,  and  wastewater  management  monitoring.  Compliance \nmonitoring will be conducted during the detailed design and construction phases to ensure that \nmitigation  specified  in  the  environmental  management  plan  is  carried  out.  The  project \ncoordination  unit  will  assist  provincial  health  offices  in  identifying  proper  indicators  and \nundertaking compliance monitoring. Community feedback and monitoring of key environmental \nindicators will be integrated as part of the activities of the project monitoring group that will be \nformed.  \n \n23. \nthe district hospitals and health centers will be established.    \n \nF. \n \n24. \nThe consultations showed a high level of acceptance of the HSDP as it will improve the \nhospitals  and  health  centers'  current  state  and  capability  for  improved  efficiency  and  service \ndelivery,  particularly \nthe  raised \nenvironmental  concerns  included  the  lack  of  proper  waste  management,  lack  of  adequate \npersonnel for facility operation and maintenance, inadequate water supply at certain times of the \nyear,  internal  drainage  problems  during  rainy  seasons,  and  basic  lack  of  equipment  and \nsupplies.  Such  concerns  will  be  incorporated  in  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  plans  during \nproject design and implementation. \n  \n25. \nTo ensure that future project activities are conducted in a participatory manner, a range \nof  public  consultation  and  disclosure  activities  will  be  implemented  throughout  project \nimplementation and evaluation using project disclosure requirements.   \n \nG. \n\nto  achieve  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Some  of \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n\nThe  project  activities  implemented  under  the  HSDP  are  expected  to  have  a  range  of \n26. \nmajor  social  benefits,  particularly  for  mothers,  children,  and  ethnic  groups.  The  Project  is \nexpected to benefit the population of the targeted district hospitals and health centers. It is also \nexpected  to  support  policy  reforms  on  the  regulation  of  the  hospitals  and  health  centers  with \nrespect  to  hospital  facility  and  equipment  standards,  environmental  protection,  sanitation  and \nhygiene  standards,  environmental  regulation  issues  (particularly  on  health  care  waste \nmanagement  issues),  and  quality  of  health  care  delivery.  Based  on  the  analyses  contained  in \nIEE, the following recommendations are made. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n79\n\nThe  IEE  concluded  that  no  significant  environmental  impacts  will  occur  as  a \nresult  of  the  activities  under  the  Project.  The  overall  HSDP  classification  of \ncategory B will continue to be monitored during implementation. \nTo  ensure  that  environmental  issues  receive an  appropriate  level  of  recognition \nand  action  in  its  implementation,  it  is  recommended  that  the  grant  agreement \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Government  make  specific  reference  to  environmental \nissues and include relevant covenants for action in the said documents.  \nEnvironmental compliance certificates or their equivalent form in the Government \nshould be issued by the Water Resources and Environment Agency before any \ncivil works are contracted for construction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 October 2009) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "\u2013 \n", "kip (KN) \n", "KN1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.0001174743 \nKN8,512.50 \n", " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "executing agency \n", "capacity development technical assistance \n", "gross domestic product \nhuman resources for health \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Department of Planning and Finance \n\u2013 \n\u2013  European Union \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Health Sector Development Program \ninitial environmental examination \n\u2013 \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n\u2013 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013 \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  multiple indicator cluster survey \n\u2013  maternal, newborn, and child health  \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Health \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Nam Theun 2 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations \n\u2013  United Nations Population Fund \n\u2013  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n\u2013 \nvillage health volunteer \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n", "national competitive bidding \nnational socio-economic development plan \n", "project coordination unit \nprimary health care \nprovincial health office \n", "ADB \nCDTA \nDPF \nEA \nEU \nGDP \nHRH \nHSDP \nIEE \nJFPR \nJICA \nLao PDR \nLARF \nLARP \nMDG \nMICS \nMNCH \nMOF \nMOH \nNCB \nNSEDP \nNT2 \nPCU \nPHC \nPHO \nPRSO \nUNFPA \nUNICEF \nVHV \nWHO \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  September.
