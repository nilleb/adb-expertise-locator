The loan will scale up and extend the socioeconomic benefits of the project by improving \nthe quality and reliability of wastewater management services in five additional aimag centers in \nother regions of the country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nCurrent project. On 19 April 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a grant \n2. \nof $15.0 million from its Special Funds resources for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town \nDevelopment Project to support the provision of urban infrastructure and service improvements in \nthe fast-growing urban areas of the Southeast Gobi.1 The grant has been extended and its closing \ndate  is  31  May  2019. 2  To  complement  the  outputs  of  the  grant,  ADB  approved  a  loan  of  \n$19.43  million  on  22  April  2016  as  additional  financing  for  the  construction  and  operation  of \nwastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  in  four  aimag  centers. 3  The  loan  was  approved  with \nattached technical assistance (TA) of $1.0 million provided by the Sanitation Financing Partnership \nTrust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility.4 The TA was to support the Government \nof Mongolia in addressing sludge reuse, including implementing a pilot program in one of the four \naimag  centers. The  loan  closing  date  is  30  June  2020,  while  the  TA  closing  date  is  31 October \n2019.  Project  implementation  progress  is  satisfactory.  The  grant  was  implemented  on  time  and \ncompleted by July 2018 with both physical progress and disbursement at 98%. The first additional \nfinancing is on track with disbursement at 19.7% and contract awards at 58.3% by July 2018.  \n \n3. \nAdditional  financing.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  prioritized  the  request  for  a  second \nadditional  financing  loan  to  replicate  some  of  the  outputs  of  the  current  project5 in  other  aimag \ncenters  with  comparable  geographic  and  economic  characteristics  and  similar  wastewater \ntreatment needs. The proposed loan will finance the construction and operation of WWTPs in five \naimag  centers:  Baruun-Urt  (Sukhbaatar  province),  Bulgan  City  (Bulgan  province),  Chinggis  City \n(Khentii province), Mandalgovi (Dundgovi province), and Murun (Khuvsgul province). \n \n4. \nThe project aimags are examples of rapidly growing second-tier cities. With an aggregate \nurban population of about 115,000, the project aimags made up about 5.4% of Mongolia\u2019s urban \npopulation in 2017.6 Two of the project aimags centers (Chinggis City and Baruun-Urt) have shown \nabove-average  increases  in  population  and  share  of  the  gross  domestic  product,  while  the \npopulation and gross domestic product in the remaining three (Bulgan City, Mandalgovi, and Murun) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n\n2  The implementation of the grant is complete, with only a small disbursement remaining. The good performance of the \n\ngrant enabled its extension and the subsequent processing of the proposed additional financing. \n\n3  ADB  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  for  Additional \nFinancing and  Administration of  Technical  Assistance Grant  to  Mongolia  for  the Southeast  Gobi  Urban and  Border \nTown  Development  Project.  Manila.  The  aimag  centers  are  Arvaikheer  (Uvurkhangai),  Dalanzadgad  (Umnugovi), \nSainshand (Dornogovi), and Tsetserleg (Arkhangai). \n\n4  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Administered by ADB. \n5  For  clarity,  the  original  grant  and  the  first  additional  financing  loan  are  referred  to  as  \u201cthe  current  project\u201d  and  the \n\nproposed second additional financing as \u201cthe proposed project.\u201d \n\n6  The total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 30,273 households in the apartment and ger areas once plants \n\nare operating at full capacity and includes businesses and institutions within aimag centers. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fhave grown at or slightly below the national average outside the capital, Ulaanbaatar.7 All project \ncities  have  a  sewerage  network  that  serves  the  core  urban  area.  The  public  utility  service \norganizations  (PUSOs)  have  found  that  the  relatively  young  sewerage  systems  are  in  generally \ngood condition and not in need of replacement or expansion. 8 All project cities have WWTPs, which \nemploy waste stabilization (oxidation) ponds as the main biological treatment process. The pond \nsystems  are  preceded  in  some  cases  (Chinggis  City  and  Mandalgovi)  by  preliminary  (screening \nand  grit  removal)  and  primary  (sedimentation)  treatment  processes.  However,  these  preliminary \ntreatment units are no longer fully operational.9 Similarly to aimag centers under the current project, \nall the treatment systems (i) are generally in a poor state of repair, (ii) represent a technology that \nis  not  suitable  for  Mongolian  climatic  conditions,  and  (iii)  are  not  providing  a  consistent  level  of \ntreatment that complies with Mongolian wastewater discharge standards. In addition, these aimag \ncenters are growing rapidly, driven by the government\u2019s support for a large apartment construction \nprogram.10 This will lead to significant increases in wastewater flows over the next decade as new \napartment blocks are occupied, exceeding the capacity of most of the existing WWTPs. \n \n5. \non track. \n(i) \n\nPerformance of the current project. The current project has performed well11 and is rated \n\nOutput  delivery.  The  current  project  has  made  significant  progress  toward \nachieving its outcomes. It has (a) improved access to water supply, sewerage, solid \nwaste management, and heating coverage in planned (non-ger) areas in the project \nsoums; (b) ensured that almost 95% of ger area dwellers in the project soums have \naccess to potable water within 300 meters of their dwellings; (c) reduced the time \nwomen and children take to collect water; and (d) established and made operational \nnew water supply, sewerage, and heating networks. The current project is also on \ntrack  to  accomplish  all  of  its  outputs.  Under  part  A,12 standard  lease  agreements \nnow form the basis of the service agreements between the local governments and \nPUSOs.  Urban development  plans (general  plans) for  Khanbogd, Gurvantes,  and \nTsogttsetsii  soums  of  Umnugovi  aimag  and  Sainshand  soum  of  Dornogovi  aimag \nwere  prepared  and  approved  by  aimag  khurals  and  the  relevant  state  expertise \nagency. 13  Capacity  building  seminars  and  training  on  institutional  and  human \nresource development, urban planning and implementation of the general plans, and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  were  held  for  more  than  250  aimag  officials,  of \nwhom  35%  were  women.  Under  part  B,  new  water  supply,  wastewater collection, \nsolid waste management, and heating system improvements have been financed in \nDalanzadgad,  Gurvantes,  Khanbogd,  Sainshand,  Tsogttsetsii,  and  Zamyn-Uud. \nWhile most assets delivered under part A of the current project are completed and \n\n                                                \n7  Based  on  ADB.  2015.  Mongolia  National  Urban  Assessment.  Ulaanbaatar;  and aimag  population  records.  Average \npopulation  growth  rates  from  2008  to  2017  were  as  follows:  national  1.4%,  Bulgan  City  0.7%,  Baruun-Urt  3.5%, \nChinggis City 3.4%, Mandalgovi 1.2%, and Murun 1.0%. \n\n8  PUSOs are agencies responsible for managing and operating water and wastewater services on behalf of the aimag \n\ngovernments. \n\n9  Existing pond systems will be decommissioned, except in Bulgan City, Chinggis City, and Murun, where they will be \nreused  as  polishing  ponds.  The  capacities  of  existing  plants  are  as  follows:  Baruun-Urt  720  cubic  meters  per  day \n(m3/day); Bulgan City 800 m3/day; Chinggis City 1,100 m3/day; Mandalgovi 1,400 m3/day; and Murun 1,000 m3/day. \n10 In 2015, the national government launched the \u201c100,000 houses\u201d program. It aims to build 25,000 homes in aimags \nand soums, and the remaining 75,000 in Ulaanbaatar. The program does not target a specific group, which means it is \nopen to all people who want to own apartments and who can meet the requirements. The program has been funded \nthrough bonds that were issued by the Development Bank of Mongolia. \n\n11 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 The current project included a total of 10 outputs presented under two parts, Part A and B.  \n13 General plans for Khanbogd, Gurvantes, and Tsogttsetsii soums of Umnugovi aimag were approved by aimag khural \non 27 March 2014 and by the State Great Khural on 6 August 2015. The general plan of Sainshand soum of Dornogovi \naimag and New Sainshand residential district partial general plan were approved by aimag khural on 4 December 2013 \nand by the State Great Khural on 24 June 2015. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\noperational,  others  are  on  track,  according  to  the  current  implementation  plan \n(footnotes 1 and 3). \nImplementation  progress.  The  current  project\u2019s  implementation  progress  is \nsatisfactory, and both disbursement and contracts awards are on track. For the first \nadditional financing, the following contracts were awarded: (a) consulting package \nfor  project  management,  procurement,  and  supervision  support  in  June  2017;  \n(b)  capacity  support  for  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  PUSOs  in \nSeptember  2017;  (c)  Umnugovi  WWTP  in  December  2017;  and  (d)  Uvurkhangai \nWWTP  in  February  2018.  The  tender  for  the  Arkhangai  WWTP  was  issued  in \nFebruary 2018. The modification of detailed designs for the Dornogovi WWTP and \nits 4.4-kilometer sewerage pipeline connection were approved in November 2017. \nSafeguard  compliance.  Safeguard  requirements  have  been  met  satisfactorily. \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedures  have  been  well \nestablished  under  the  current  project  and  applied  to  every  subproject.  The \nenvironmental management plan has been executed according to project safeguard \nrequirements. \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risk.  The  reports  and  recommendations  of  the  President  for  the \ncurrent project identified the following project risks: (a) poor capital investment and \nbudget  planning,  (b) underdeveloped  institutional  frameworks  and  poor  capacity,  \n(c) lack of monitoring and evaluation, (d) poor procurement integrity, and (e) weak \nnational  contractors. The  PMU  provided  project management  and  implementation \nsupport, and project implementation units successfully managed most of the risks \nby  (a)  building  the  capacity  of  local  government  service  institutions  in  investment \nplanning  and  improved  service  delivery  and  operation,  (b)  supporting  institutional \nchange on measuring and improving service delivery performance, (c) adopting a \nmodality  for  procurement  of  priority  infrastructure  improvements  to  attract  better-\nqualified  national  contractors,  and  (d)  combining  small  civil  works  activities  into \nlarger contract packages to generate economies of scale. \n\nis  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy \n\n \n6. \nAdditional  financing  eligibility  criteria  met.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the \nproposed project meets the eligibility criteria and standards. It is in line with the government\u2019s action \nplan  for  2016\u20132020,  which  prioritizes  the  development  of  infrastructure  and  services  in  aimag \ncenters.14 The proposed project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, \n2019\u20132021 15  and \nfor  Mongolia,  \n2017\u20132020.16 With its objective to contribute to inclusive economic and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth,  the  proposed  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and follows  ADB\u2019s  urban  and \nwater  operational  plans. 17 The  additional  financing  is  also  consistent  with  the  current  project\u2019s \ndevelopment objective to expand access to sustainable infrastructure and services in aimag urban \ncenters.  Further,  with  the  inclusion  of  the  additional  financing,  the  current  project  remains \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n \n7. \nAdditional financing priority met. The proposed additional financing is for aimag centers \nsimilar to those in the current project and offers a treatment technology that is identical to the first \nadditional financing. The proposed project has a high degree of readiness: subprojects are clearly \nidentified  and  detailed  designs  have  been  fully  prepared  and  are  ready  for  approval.  This  has \n                                                \n14 Government of Mongolia. 2016. Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. \n15 ADB. 2018.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \nThe proposed project demonstrates alignment with the operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030 particularly in terms \nof environmental sustainability and integrated solutions for livable cities. \n\n \n\n\fallowed the required due diligence to be carried out promptly and efficiently, and for feasibility to be \nfirmly  established.  Because  the  proposed  project  will  use  the  management  arrangements  of  the \ncurrent project, the implementation capacity is well advanced through the PMU\u2019s experience with \nsimilar technical, economic, financial, and safeguard requirements. The existing PMU\u2019s capacity for \nproject management and implementation support to the aimag governments, built during the current \nproject, adds to the proposed project\u2019s readiness and supports the effective administration of the \nadditional  financing.  These  features  will  allow  the  executing  agency  and  ADB  to  properly  and \ncomprehensively mitigate implementation-related risks. \n \n8. \nChanges in project scope. In response to a request from the government, the proposed \nproject will (i) extend the geographical scope of the current project by including the construction of \nfive  new  WWTPs  in  the  additional  aimag  centers  of  Baruun-Urt,  Bulgan  City,  Chinggis  City, \nMandalgovi, and Murun;18 and (ii) extend the institutional reform and capacity building being carried \nout under the current project to the five additional aimag centers. Consequently, the focus of the \nproposed project\u2019s outcome extends to achieving government standards for wastewater discharges \nand  reuse  of  sewage  effluent.  The  proposed  project  will  contribute  to  a  more  balanced  national \nurban system and stronger urban\u2013rural relationships by contributing to the development of second-\ntier cities in the country. It will also improve environmental conditions and reduce environmental \npollution in and around the project cities. The proposed project will support improvements to the \ncities\u2019  wastewater  management  by  building  new  WWTPs,  complemented  by  support  for  project \nmanagement,  capacity  development,  and  training.  The  new  WWTPs  include  an  energy-efficient \ntreatment  process  adopting  integrated  fixed-film  activated  sludge  (IFAS)  technology,  which  is \nworking  well  under  the  first  additional  financing.19 This  system  is  suitable  for  the  project  aimag \ncenters\u2019 cold climate and will produce effluent that meets national and international standards. \n \n9. \nLessons  from  the  current  project  on  the  selection  of  the  treatment  technology  and  the \ncapacity of the plants were incorporated in the proposed project design. Through the current project, \nuseful knowledge has ensured the quality of detailed designs which are completed, saving time on \npreconstruction activities and increasing the reliability of cost estimates. Valuable experience from \nthe current project will also allow efficient procurement packaging that secures optimal response to \ntenders and proficient evaluation of contractor capabilities. In addition, the enhanced institutional \nsupport and capacity building provided under the proposed project take into consideration similar \nactivities  under  the  first  additional  financing  and  their  degree  of  success.  Consequently,  the \nproposed use of national consultants to assist the PUSOs is focused on incorporating optimized \norganizational  and  management  reforms  set  out  under  the  current  project  and  through  previous \nurban development projects in Mongolia.20 \n \n\n                                                \n18 Since  2014,  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  (MCUD)  has  been  implementing  a  program  to \nrehabilitate WWTPs across all aimags. MCUD selected these five aimag centers according to (i) urgency in terms of \nlevels of water pollution and numbers of affected people, and (ii) suitability for replication of technology and design from \nthe current project. \n\n19 The IFAS system emerged as the most suitable for use in the project aimags as a result of a two-stage evaluation \nprocess, which assessed the operational efficiency, cost effectiveness, and robustness of WWTPs of this size under \nMongolian conditions. This selection was ratified by a technical committee under MCUD. The IFAS system has the \nadditional benefits of (i) being the technology used for the WWTPs included under the first additional financing project \nin Arvaikheer, Dalanzadgad, Tsetserleg, and Sainshand; (ii) being the technology used for the new ADB-supported \ntreatment plant in Darkhan; and (iii) having been successfully adopted for treatment of wastewater in two aimag centers \nof similar size to the project aimags (Sukhbaatar and Zunmod). Further details on selected technology are in para 16. \n20 These reforms aim at strengthening ownership and accountability of PUSOs during and beyond the project life cycle. \nThis  refers  not  only  to  project  management,  procurement,  and  safeguards  monitoring  but  also  to  sound  asset \nmanagement including operation and maintenance (O&M), and more efficient debt collection systems. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\nB. \n \n10. \nProject impact and outcomes. The proposed project\u2019s impact and outcomes are aligned \nwith  those  of  the  current  project.  The  proposed  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact: \neconomic development and livability in aimag centers (mining and border towns in Southeast Gobi) \nenhanced.21 The proposed project will have the following outcomes: urban governance improved \nand access to sustainable infrastructure and services expanded in urban places in Southeast Gobi \nand other aimags.22 \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe proposed project will have the following outputs: (i) wastewater collection and treatment \ninfrastructure  constructed  and  operationalized,  delivering  effluent  that  satisfies  Mongolian \nwastewater discharge standards; and (ii) strategic planning, management, and cost recovery for \nwastewater management strengthened. \n \n12. \nOutput  A:  Wastewater  collection  and  treatment  infrastructure  constructed  and \noperationalized. The proposed project will establish modern wastewater treatment facilities with \nindividual operating capacity of 3,000 m3 in the aimag centers of Baruun-Urt, Bulgan City, Chinggis \nCity, Mandalgovi, and Murun, replacing the inadequate waste stabilization pond systems.23 Based \non the findings from the pilot operation carried out under ADB\u2019s TA for Management and Reuse of \nSewage  Sludge  from  On-Site  Sanitation  Facilities  and  Decentralized  Wastewater  Treatment \nPlants,24 the project will support the provision of vacuum evacuation trucks to all aimag centers to \nimprove ger area sanitation and prevent ground and surface water pollution (footnote 4). \n \n13. \nOutput  B:  Strategic  planning,  management,  and  cost  recovery  for  wastewater \nmanagement  strengthened.  The  proposed  project  will  (i)  provide  expert  support  for  project \nmanagement,  institutional  enhancement  and  capacity  development  in  utility  management, \noperation  and  service  provision,  emergency  preparedness  and  response,  and  construction \nsupervision;  and  (ii)  strengthen  PMU  and  PUSO  capacities.  Training  and  study  tours  will  be \nprovided during implementation. The proposed project will include policy dialogue with the PUSOs \non water and wastewater tariff reform and sanitation improvements. It will support public awareness \ncampaigns on environmental management and sanitation, as well as improve institutional capacity \nin utility service provision, strategic planning, and operations. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14. \nThe proposed project is estimated to cost $21.75 million.

The PMU\u2019s professional capacity will be strengthened by the addition of six \ntechnical positions in the fields of construction management and supervision. MCUD will nominate \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\na project director, and the PMU will continue to be headed by a project coordinator.

The \nwastewater  treatment  technology  proposed  for  adoption  in  all  five  aimags  was  subjected  to \nintensive scrutiny and analysis, resulting in a short list of technology choices most appropriate for \noperation  under  local  conditions.  A  two-stage  process  was  adopted  to  evaluate  alternative \nwastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-cost solution. In carrying out this \nanalysis,  ADB  made  maximum  use  of  current  operating  experience  in  Mongolia,  as  well  as  the \nanalysis and discussions carried out during preparation of the Darkhan Wastewater Management \nProject and the first additional financing to the current project (footnote 3) which adopted the same \ntechnology.26 The evaluation concluded that the IFAS process provides the most appropriate and \noperationally  sustainable  technical  solution  for  wastewater  treatment.  Measures  to  mitigate \npossible operational and lifetime risks will be implemented, including (i) ensuring that the existing \nWWTPs  can  be  operated  throughout  the  entire  reconstruction  process  while  meeting  treatment \nstandards; (ii) using the polishing ponds as emergency storage if a WWTP fails; and (iii) committing \n                                                \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2014.

While  a  few  of  the  still-\nfunctioning waste stabilization ponds will be reused along with the new WWTPs, most of the existing \nfacilities will be decommissioned by the PUSOs with support from MCUD. 27 \n \nB. \n \n18. \nEconomic and financial analyses were conducted for the overall project and for individual \nsubproject  aimag  centers  and  PUSOs  following  ADB  guidelines. 28  Available  information  from \nsubprojects  was  verified  to  support  new  additional  financing  subproject  sites.  The  economic \nanalysis included a least-cost analysis of alternative options to ensure that optimum benefits accrue \nto service the populations in the aimag centers. The least-cost analysis resulted in the choice of \nIFAS technology rather than bioreactor. The proposed project will generate health benefits such as \navoided  medical  costs;  resource cost  savings,  including  domestic  wastewater  disposal  time  and \ntreatment; and an improved and safer environment. The economic benefits were estimated from \nthe results of willingness-to-pay surveys conducted in the appointed service areas. The economic \nanalysis  indicated  that the  individual  subprojects  are  economically  viable  with  economic  internal \nrates of return of 10.6% for Bulgan City, 13.2% for Chinggis City, 12.6% for Mandalgovi, 10.7% for \nBaruun-Urt and 11.3% for Murun\u2014all exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 11.5% with an economic \nnet present value at MNT10,785 million. \n \n19. \nThe financial analysis for the project was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of \nADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (footnote 28). A stand-alone assessment of \nproject  viability  cannot  be  conducted  at  the  PUSO  level  because  they  do  not  have  a  full  cost-\nrecovery  tariff.  Financial  sustainability  was  assessed  based  on  (i)  subsidies  from  aimag \ngovernments, tariff increases, and efficiency improvements for the PUSOs; and (ii) recurrent costs \nfor  operation  and  maintenance  and  debt  service  obligations.  While  the  PUSOs  incur  net  losses \nnearly annually, aimags partly subsidize operations to avoid a degradation of services. Thus, project \nsustainability is at risk as it depends on these budget allocations. Since 2015 to 2016, the PUSOs \nimplemented  tariff  increases  based  on  rates  approved  by  the  National  Water  Regulatory \nCommission.  Tariffs  are  proposed  to  be  adjusted  at  least  every  3  years,  starting  in  2019  when \nconstruction is underway. To maintain project sustainability, a combination of improved efficiency \nmeasures for the PUSOs, tariff increases, and assurances of subsidies have been covenanted. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nFinancial management assessments of the aimag governments and the PUSOs, coupled \nwith a procurement capacity assessment of MCUD, rated the risks moderate. They concluded that \nMCUD  and  the  aimag  governments,  with  the  support  of  the  PMU,  have  adequate  capacity  for \nfinancial  management  and  procurement  under  the  project.  PMU  staff  for  the  current  project  is \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n27 In the case of Bulgan City, Chinggis City, and Murun, some of the existing ponds will be reused as maturation (polishing) \nponds for treated effluent and sludge drying beds. These will remain within the security fencing of the new WWTPs. \nThose ponds at these three locations, which will not be reused, and the existing ones at Baruun Urt and Mandalgovi \nwill  be  decommissioned.  This  will  involve  (i)  draining  or  pumping  wastewater  for  treatment;  (ii)  allowing  remaining \nwastewater to evaporate and sludge to dry out; (iii) removing the dried sludge for retention on site to support vegetation \ngrowth,  reuse  in  nurseries, or  disposal  in landfill sites;  and (iv)  reforming the  land  for  reuse as  grazing or for  other \npurposes.  These  activities  will  be  supervised  by  the  PUSOs  with  support  from  MCUD  through  the  PMU  and  its \nconsultants. \n\n28 ADB.  1999.

In  2016,  among  the  five  project  aimag  centers,  Baruun-Urt  (47.0%), \nChinggis City (43.8%), Bulgan City (31.4%), Murun (29.1%) and Mandalgovi (22.8%), the first three \nexperienced poverty rates higher the national average. The proposed project will benefit the poor \nand vulnerable households in the apartment and ger areas by improving their health conditions and \nreducing  health  care  expenditure  related  to  poor  water  quality  and  unsanitary  environmental \nconditions.  It  will  increase  participation,  especially  of  the  poor  and  women,  in  improving  public \nservices. The proposed project will create about 256 jobs; most of the unskilled jobs will go to local \npeople, including the poor, and at least 30% will be for women. Details on the specific measures to \nachieve the poverty and social benefits are in the social and gender action plan (SGAP) included \nin  the  PAM  (footnote  25).  The  SGAP  was  prepared  to  ensure  continued  consultation  and \nparticipation  of  the  local  communities  during  project  implementation.  Actions  include  (i)  a  public \nawareness program on improved wastewater public services; (ii) consultations and public hearings \non a wastewater tariff increase; and (iii) targets for employment of local labor, women, and the poor \nduring  construction  and  operation.  Implementation  will  be  monitored  through  the  project \nperformance management system, project progress reports, and ADB missions. \n \n22. \nGender.  The  current  project  was  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  current \nproject gender action plan is ongoing with about 50% of the activities completed and 67% of targets \nachieved. The proposed project will focus only on improving the quality and reliability of wastewater \nmanagement  services  in  five  additional  aimag  centers  in  other  regions  of  the  country.  As  the \nproposed project satisfies the threshold for effective gender mainstreaming, a combined SGAP was \ndeveloped. The SGAP includes activities targeted at both males and females. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nEnvironment (category B). The environment categorization of the current project is B since \nno  unprecedented  or  irreversible  impact  on  the  environment  is  anticipated.  In  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  an \nenvironmental management plan were prepared for the components to be supported through the \nproposed project.29 Short-term impacts are anticipated during construction, including dust, noise, \nand waste generated during earthwork and civil works activities, as well as minor community and \noccupational health and safety risks. Operation and maintenance training, as well as performance \nmonitoring, will minimize operational impacts and risks and optimize environmental benefits. The \nproposed project\u2019s climate risk is low. \n \n24. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The \nproposed project is categorized B for involuntary resettlement as it will affect the leased land and a \nfixed asset (40-meter deep well) of two private companies within the WWTP buffer zone in Chinggis \nCity. The affected entities were consulted during resettlement planning. Replacement land will be \nallocated, while the affected asset will be compensated at replacement cost. A resettlement plan \nwas  prepared.  The  proposed  project  will  be  implemented  in  peri-urban  areas  where  no  specific \ncommunities  of  ethnic minorities  or groups  are  living.  No  adverse  impacts  are  expected,  and  all \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n29 ADB. 2010. Safeguard Policy Statement. Operations Manual. OM F1.
