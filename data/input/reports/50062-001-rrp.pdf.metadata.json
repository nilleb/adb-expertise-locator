THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Road Asset Management Project. \n \n2.  The proposed grant will finance priority maintenance works for part of Afghanistan\u2019s \nregional highway sections from Kabul to Ghazni and from Kabul to Jalalabad, which are the \neconomic  lifeline  of  the  country\u2019s  eastern  region.  The  project  will  include  a  capacity \ndevelopment component to introduce sustainable road management practices, specifically in \nroad asset management and road maintenance.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Prolonged conflict has devastated Afghanistan\u2019s economy by destroying the minimal \neconomic infrastructure and institutions that the country once possessed and driving more than \n2.5 million Afghans away from their homes and livelihoods. Since the fall of the Taliban regime, \nthe country has received billions of dollars in international assistance, which has dramatically \nboosted the country\u2019s gross domestic product to more than $20 billion\u2014five times higher than in \n2002. However, the country is still at the very beginning of recreating an economy that can \naddress  the  needs  of  its  people.  Afghanistan  requires  stable  and  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment.  To  this  end,  and  with  donor  support,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  has \ndeveloped  a  range  of  policies  and  strategies,  not  all  of  which  have  been  successfully \nimplemented. The 2008\u20132013 Afghanistan National Development Strategy,1 the country\u2019s first \nstrategy  paper  for  poverty  reduction,  has  set  the  context  for  rebuilding  the  country  by  \n(i) addressing poverty through private sector-led equitable economic growth and (ii) exploiting \nthe economy\u2019s growth potential. \n \n4.  Afghanistan\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected situation has also heavily damaged its roads. \nBy 1994, around 80% of the 42,000-kilometer (km) network was in a poor state of repair, and \nroad  conditions  deteriorated  further  until  2002,  when  major  reconstruction  programs  were \nbegun. The government focused on reconstructing damaged or destroyed roads, as well as \nrehabilitating roads that had fallen into disrepair due to a prolonged lack of maintenance. A \nmassive  multinational  reconstruction  and  development  effort  to  rebuild  Afghanistan's \ninfrastructure  has  been  underway  since  2002,  and  nearly  8,000  km  of  roads  have  been \nreconstructed or rehabilitated. While the government and development partners have focused \non reconstruction, the sustainability of past investments has resurfaced as a major sector issue. \nAccording to the ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) study for operation and maintenance \n(O&M), 85% of the road network is in poor condition, and only 50% is serviceable year-round \ncondition.  \n \n5.  Financial and institutional sustainability are some of the main challenges facing roads \nnetwork O&M in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has so far been unable to \nfully implement various approaches proposed in the 2006\u20132013 O&M strategy.2 The lack of \npolicies  pertaining  to  road  user  charges  and  O&M  financing  further  complicates  these \nchallenges, both financially and institutionally. Afghanistan is not expected to be financially self-\nreliant in the interim. Institutional O&M challenges include organizational and human resource \nissues. Organizationally, the mandates of the different organizations responsible for the road \n                                                 \n1  Government of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Operation and Maintenance Strategy. Kabul. ", "2 \nnetwork must be properly delineated. Functionally, the MPW lacks the specialized system to \nensure adequate and accountable operations. A tool for planning and managing roads O&M at \nthe national level does not exist. The scattered bits and pieces of this system must be integrated \nand properly developed to enable the systematic planning and management of roads O&M. \n \n6.  Realizing the importance and seriousness of the issue, development partners since \n2011 have started to pay attention to roads O&M and been able to contribute to $150 million. \nThe donors\u2019 primary efforts include the Road Sector Sustainability Program (RSSP) of the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  National  Rural \nAccess Program (NRAP). Under the $109 million Road Sector Sustainability Program, short- \nand  long-term  plans  have  been  jointly  agreed  upon  by  the  government  and  development \npartners. In the short term, a 5-year transfer process has been defined, with roads O&M funded \nby donor contributions in the first year and by road user fees in the fifth and final year. In the \nlong term, three autonomous entities\u2014a road authority, road fund, and transportation institute\u2014\nwill be created to ensure sector sustainability. The road authority will manage road development \nand maintenance; the road fund will provide sustainable financing for roads O&M; and the \ntransportation  institute  will  train  Afghan  professionals  and  build  their  capacity  in  transport \nengineering. Apart from road development, the $332 million NRAP also allocated (i) $21 million \nfor routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved secondary roads, and (ii) $1.5 \nmillion for a road network inventory. \n \n7.  The  proposed  project  aims  to  (i)  initiate  establishment  of  a  sustainable  road \nmaintenance  system  for  the  country\u2019s  major  highways  and  (ii)  develop  the  MPW\u2019s  O&M \ncapacity.  The  project\u2019s  two  major  components  are  road  maintenance  and  road  asset \nmanagement system (RAMS). The road maintenance component will implement RSSP\u2019s short-\nterm plan, which requires donor contributions in its early years before the road fund and road \nauthority are established and fully functional. Two sections of the national highways, namely (i) \nKabul\u2013Jalalabad highway (excluding the section under pilot subproject section),3 and (ii) the \nKabul\u2013Kandahar highway from Kabul to Ghazni, were selected for maintenance due to their \neconomic and strategic importance. The Kabul-Jalalabad highway, the busiest intercity highway \nin Afghanistan with the annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 5,515 vehicles, is one of the \nnation\u2019s economic lifelines. The Kabul-Ghazni section is part of the strategic national ring road. \nThe pavement condition of the two road sections comprises different degrees of deterioration, \nwith the international roughness index (IRI) of 8-10, due to the fact that maintenance has been \nprovided mostly on ad-hoc basis. The RAMS component will develop a RAMS as a primary \ndecision-support tool to help the MPW plan and manage road O&M. This will build on previous \nefforts, especially the road network inventory developed under the World Bank\u2019s NRAP. A \nproper asset management system will help the MPW ensure objective planning and improve \nroad serviceability, and cost-effectiveness utilization of the available resources.  \n \n8.  The fragile and conflict-affected states approach will be adopted to ensure the project\u2019s \nsmooth and successful implementation.4 This will attract funds from other development partners \nto support future roads O&M through the ADB-managed Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Afghanistan for the Transport Network Development Investment Program, Tranche 4. Manila. \nA pilot subproject for road maintenance was launched under Tranche 4 to provide periodic maintenance for a 50 \nkm section of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad highway from Kabul to Surubi. The pilot subproject aims to (i) assess the \nMPW\u2019s overall O&M capacity, and (ii) develop a methodology that best suits the Afghan context and will be used in \nfuture roads O&M projects. The maintenance works include overlay in some sections, pothole patching, crack \nsealing, surface sealing, mill and fill, and roadside maintenance. \n4  ADB. 2016.

The project is fully consistent with the government\u2019s transport strategy and development \nplans (footnotes 1 and 2), and will help achieve the results of the country partnership strategy, \n2009\u20132013 and interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015.5 The project is also included \nin the country operations business plan 2016\u20132018. The project is also consistent with the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 20206 \nand will contribute to achieving goals 3 (good health and well-being) and 9 (industry, innovation, \nand infrastructure) of the Sustainable Development Goals.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project impact is aligned with increased sustainability of the Afghanistan\u2019s road \ntransport sector. The outcome will be improved road connectivity and safety. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs will be (i) national highways in the southeastern region maintained, and  \n(ii) O&M and road asset management capacity enhanced.  \n \n12.  Two sections of the national highways (para. 7), a total of approximately 220 km, will be \nmaintained. The methodology used for the pilot subproject (footnote 3) will be adopted for the \nmaintenance work. It is expected that the maintenance will improve the IRI to 4-5. The proposed \nRAMS\u2019s activities include the design, development, and trial deployment of the system. This \nincludes the proper design and harmonization of the existing geographic information system \ndatabases to combine them into one database under the MPW to support the use of the RAMS \nas a sound decision-support tool to plan and manage roads O&M. Adequate information and \ncommunication technology infrastructure, including equipment and a single network that covers \nboth within the MPW and between the MPW and its provincial offices, will be provided. Finally, \nclassroom and on-the-job training using the RAMS will be provided to enhance the technical \ncapacity of MPW staff in all aspects of the system.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $26.0 million, including taxes, duties, and contingencies \n(Table 1).  \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $25.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources7 to help finance the project. ADB funding for the project includes the financing \nof taxes and duties.8 ADB financing of project taxes and duties is justified because (i) the \namount will not be an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (ii) the financing of \ntaxes and duties is material and relevant to the project\u2019s success. This is in line with ADB\u2019s \nOperations Manual.9 The World Bank also follows this practice in Afghanistan. The financing \nplan is in Table 2. The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and financier are in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).10 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \nAmount   Share of Total  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)  25.5  98.1 \nGovernment  0.5  1.9 \nTotal  26.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MOF will be the executing agency, and the MPW through the program management \noffice  (PMO)  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  Quality  assurance  and  control  of  the \nmaintenance work will be carried out by a team comprising MPW engineers and national \nconsultants under the supervision of the road maintenance expert engaged under the RAMS \ncomponent. Procurement financed by the ADB grant will be undertaken in accordance with \n                                                 \n7  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Afghanistan had a high risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n8  Taxes and duties costs include the business receipt tax estimated at 7%, the fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%, and \ncustoms duties of 2.5%\u201316.0%. These costs do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are \nwithin applicable country partnership strategy parameters. ADB. 2005.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n17.  The condition survey of the project roads, including quantities and cost estimates, is \nbeing carried out by a team of local engineers with the support of the MPW\u2019s O&M department. \nThis condition survey is financed under the capacity development component of the Transport \nNetwork  Development  Investment  Program  Tranche  4  (footnote  3)  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted in December 2016. The detailed maintenance and repair methodology is based on \nthe original methodology developed for the pilot O&M subproject. After a thorough assessment \nby  the  RAMS  consultants,  the  RAMS  database  will  be  built  up  from  the  inventory  being \nconducted under the NRAP financed by the World Bank. The major cost of the RAMS is \nenvisaged to be the system\u2019s hardware, which must have adequate capacity to support the \nsoftware and database.  \n \n18.  Preliminary  climate  risk  screening  shows  that  the  project\u2019s  climate  change  risk  is \nmedium.  The  project  scope  only  includes  the  partial  overlay  and  repair  of  pavement. \n ", "6 \nNevertheless, the development of  awareness of climate risks and knowledge of mitigation \nmeasures for the road project design will be considered under the RAMS component. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The project will help achieve the envisaged benefits of the improved transport corridor, \nincluding lower transport costs and shorter travel times. The economic evaluation of the project \nwas undertaken using ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects11 and following \nthe analytical framework of the highway development and management model.12 The traffic \nforecast is based on traffic counts conducted on the project road in early 2015. Based on the \n2015 average daily traffic volume, annual normal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2016\u20132035. \nProject costs and benefits are calculated based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios. The economic costs are capital cost, including physical contingencies, but excluding \ntaxes and O&M. The economic benefits are vehicle operating cost savings resulting from the \nimproved project road and time savings. The economic analysis showed that the project is \neconomically feasible with a high estimated economic internal rate of return of 33.4%. This \nconfirms past ADB experience with maintenance projects, which are known to generate high \neconomic returns. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain feasible should the \nenvisaged project costs increase or benefits be reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken \nbecause the project road will not generate revenue. \n \n20.  The proposed project addresses the two financial sustainability concerns: the lack of an \neffective O&M regime, and a chronic shortage of funds for O&M. Government funding for \nmaintenance is unlikely to meet the requirements to preserve the value of the road assets. The \ngovernment would have to raise more than $200 million to meet the annual maintenance needs \nof its core road network. Given the country\u2019s narrow economic base and competing needs on \nscarce budget resources, Afghanistan will have to rely on donor contributions to finance road \nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. Increased funds for O&M are necessary, although not \nsufficient, to ensure road asset sustainability. The government was able to collect $83 million \nrecently through road user fees and taxes, more needs to be done. A RAMS to provide a \nrigorous framework for managing future maintenance will be developed in conjunction with the \nproject. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Governance risks are a major challenge in Afghanistan. The project has been designed \nto mitigate these risks, especially in the areas of financial management and procurement. An \nupdated financial management assessment of the MPW and its PMO took into consideration \ntheir  overall  capacity,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  governance,  staffing,  budgeting, \naccounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial information \nsystems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. This assessment found that, from a \nfinancial management perspective, the overall control risk is moderate, and that the MPW and \nPMO have adequate experience and capacity in financial management to manage the project \nfunds as well as adequate fund flow, accounting, and budgeting arrangements. The 2015 \nrestructuring of the PMO has significantly improved its overall capacity. The PMO\u2019s finance \ndepartment staff includes a manager, five accountants, and a trainee. The MPW conducts \ninternal audits periodically annual external audits have yielded satisfactory results since ADB\u2019s \nengagement with the MPW in 2003. The MPW is responsible for ensuring an adequate audit \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Paris. \n ", "7 \ntrail, for which annual financial statements are audited by an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB in accordance with auditing standards. \n \n22.  Improvement  is  needed  in  the  areas  of  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  and  \nreporting and monitoring. In the area of accounting policies and procedures, the PMO has been \nusing a manual book accounting approach, which is being outperformed by modern accounting \nsoftware. In the area of reporting and monitoring, the PMO has demonstrated capacity to \nmonitor and report project finances based on ADB requirements. However, some delays in the \nsubmission of audited project financial statements have occurred. Thus, the updated financial \nmanagement assessment recommended that (i) modern accounting software be procured and \ninstalled as soon as possible so that the relevant PMO staff can be trained in its use; and (ii) an \ninternational financial management specialist be recruited to help PMO staff conduct financial \nmanagement, ensuring that the audited project financial statements are submitted in a more \ntimely manner. Financial management risks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and \nupdated throughout the project\u2019s life. \n \n23.  All goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The government requested and ADB agreed to manage \nthe RAMS component, procure the RAMS, and recruit the consultants. This will ensure the \ntransparency of the procurement process and mitigate the risk of delays, especially of the \nRAMS component of which most activities are on the implementation plan\u2019s critical path. The \nMPW will remain responsible for negotiating and signing the contracts, issuing the notice to \nproceed, and supervising the contracts. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 10).  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOF, and MPW. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The poverty and social assessment conducted for the project revealed the extent of \npoverty in the country, including, among other factors, (i) a high rate of food insecurity affecting \none-third of the population, (ii) a lack of access to improved water resources, and (iii) limited \naccess to education and health services. The gender assessment revealed high maternal and \ninfant mortality rates, limited mobility of women compared to that of men and overall low status \nof  women.  While  the  project\u2019s  long-term  impact  is  expected  to  improve  women\u2019s  physical \naccess to education, health, and other services by shortening travel times and making roads \nsafer, these benefits are indirect. The project will ensure equal pay to work for both men and \nwomen. The project is categorized as no gender elements. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  All three safeguard categories are categorized as C since (i) no land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement is required, as the maintenance work will be carried out within the right \nof  way  of  existing  roads;  (ii)  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  by  ADB  for  operational \npurposes, live within the project area; and (iii) the environmental impact will be minimal, and will \nnot  require  a  related  action.  Thus,  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  indigenous \npeoples plan, or initial environment assessment and environmental monitoring plan will be \nrequired. \n \n ", "8 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  The major residual risk is political stability of the country, which has induced security \nthreats  to  development  operation.  With  the  proposed  mitigation  measures,  the  overall  risk \nassessment is moderate, while the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.13  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \n Implementation of periodic   Development partners are helping the government to create a \nmaintenance has been  road authority, road fund, and transportation institute.
