The  project  will  include  a  capacity \ndevelopment  component  to  introduce  sustainable  road  management  practices,  specifically  in \nroad asset management and road maintenance.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nProlonged  conflict  has  devastated  Afghanistan\u2019s  economy  by  destroying  the  minimal \neconomic infrastructure and institutions that the country once possessed and driving more than \n2.5 million Afghans away from their homes and livelihoods. Since the fall of the Taliban regime, \nthe  country  has  received  billions  of  dollars  in  international  assistance,  which  has  dramatically \nboosted the country\u2019s gross domestic product to more than $20 billion\u2014five times higher than in \n2002.  However,  the  country  is  still  at  the  very  beginning  of  recreating  an  economy  that  can \naddress  the  needs  of  its  people.  Afghanistan  requires  stable  and  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment.  To  this  end,  and  with  donor  support,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  has \ndeveloped  a  range  of  policies  and  strategies,  not  all  of  which  have  been  successfully \nimplemented.  The  2008\u20132013  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy,1 the  country\u2019s  first \nstrategy  paper  for  poverty  reduction,  has  set  the  context  for  rebuilding  the  country  by  \n(i)  addressing  poverty  through  private  sector-led  equitable  economic  growth  and  (ii)  exploiting \nthe economy\u2019s growth potential. \n \n4. \nAfghanistan\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected situation has also heavily damaged its roads. \nBy 1994, around 80% of the 42,000-kilometer (km) network was in a poor state of repair, and \nroad  conditions  deteriorated  further  until  2002,  when  major  reconstruction  programs  were \nbegun.  The  government  focused  on  reconstructing  damaged  or  destroyed  roads,  as  well  as \nrehabilitating  roads  that  had  fallen  into  disrepair  due  to  a  prolonged  lack  of  maintenance.  A \nmassive  multinational  reconstruction  and  development  effort \nto  rebuild  Afghanistan's \ninfrastructure  has  been  underway  since  2002,  and  nearly  8,000  km  of  roads  have  been \nreconstructed  or  rehabilitated.  While  the  government  and  development  partners  have  focused \non reconstruction, the sustainability of past investments has resurfaced as a major sector issue. \nAccording to the ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) study for operation and maintenance \n(O&M),  85%  of  the  road  network is  in  poor condition,  and  only  50% is  serviceable  year-round \ncondition.  \n \n5. \nFinancial  and  institutional  sustainability  are  some  of  the  main  challenges  facing  roads \nnetwork  O&M  in  Afghanistan.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  has  so  far  been  unable  to \nfully  implement  various  approaches  proposed  in  the  2006\u20132013  O&M  strategy.2 The  lack  of \npolicies  pertaining  to  road  user  charges  and  O&M  financing  further  complicates  these \nchallenges, both financially and institutionally. Afghanistan is not expected to be financially self-\nreliant  in  the  interim.  Institutional  O&M  challenges  include  organizational  and  human  resource \nissues.  Organizationally,  the  mandates  of  the  different  organizations  responsible  for  the  road \n                                                 \n1  Government of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Operation and Maintenance Strategy. Kabul. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nnetwork  must  be  properly  delineated.  Functionally,  the  MPW  lacks  the  specialized  system  to \nensure adequate and accountable operations. A tool for planning and managing roads O&M at \nthe national level does not exist. The scattered bits and pieces of this system must be integrated \nand properly developed to enable the systematic planning and management of roads O&M. \n \n6. \nRealizing  the  importance  and  seriousness  of  the  issue,  development  partners  since \n2011 have started to pay attention to roads O&M and been able to contribute to $150 million. \nThe  donors\u2019  primary  efforts  include  the  Road  Sector  Sustainability  Program  (RSSP)  of  the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  National  Rural \nAccess  Program  (NRAP).  Under  the  $109  million  Road  Sector  Sustainability  Program,  short- \nand  long-term  plans  have  been  jointly  agreed  upon  by  the  government  and  development \npartners. In the short term, a 5-year transfer process has been defined, with roads O&M funded \nby  donor  contributions in  the  first  year  and  by  road  user  fees  in  the  fifth  and  final year.  In  the \nlong term, three autonomous entities\u2014a road authority, road fund, and transportation institute\u2014\nwill be created to ensure sector sustainability. The road authority will manage road development \nand  maintenance;  the  road  fund  will  provide  sustainable  financing  for  roads  O&M;  and  the \ntransportation  institute  will  train  Afghan  professionals  and  build  their  capacity  in  transport \nengineering. Apart from road development, the $332 million NRAP also allocated (i) $21 million \nfor  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  paved  and  unpaved  secondary  roads,  and  (ii)  $1.5 \nmillion for a road network inventory. \n \n7. \nThe  proposed  project  aims  to  (i)  initiate  establishment  of  a  sustainable  road \nmaintenance  system  for  the  country\u2019s  major  highways  and  (ii)  develop  the  MPW\u2019s  O&M \ncapacity.  The  project\u2019s  two  major  components  are  road  maintenance  and  road  asset \nmanagement system (RAMS). The road maintenance component will implement RSSP\u2019s short-\nterm  plan,  which  requires  donor  contributions  in  its  early  years  before  the  road  fund  and  road \nauthority are established and fully functional. Two sections of the national highways, namely (i) \nKabul\u2013Jalalabad  highway  (excluding  the  section  under  pilot  subproject  section),3 and  (ii)  the \nKabul\u2013Kandahar  highway  from  Kabul  to  Ghazni,  were  selected  for  maintenance  due  to  their \neconomic and strategic importance. The Kabul-Jalalabad highway, the busiest intercity highway \nin  Afghanistan  with  the  annual  average  daily  traffic  (AADT)  of  5,515  vehicles,  is  one  of  the \nnation\u2019s economic lifelines. The Kabul-Ghazni section is part of the strategic national ring road. \nThe pavement condition of the two road sections comprises different degrees of deterioration, \nwith the international roughness index (IRI) of 8-10, due to the fact that maintenance has been \nprovided  mostly  on  ad-hoc  basis.  The  RAMS  component  will  develop  a  RAMS  as  a  primary \ndecision-support tool to help the MPW plan and manage road O&M. This will build on previous \nefforts,  especially  the  road  network  inventory  developed  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  NRAP.  A \nproper  asset  management  system  will  help  the  MPW  ensure  objective  planning  and  improve \nroad serviceability, and cost-effectiveness utilization of the available resources.  \n \nThe fragile and conflict-affected states approach will be adopted to ensure the project\u2019s \n8. \nsmooth and successful implementation.4 This will attract funds from other development partners \nto support future roads O&M through the ADB-managed Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Afghanistan for the Transport Network Development Investment Program, Tranche 4. Manila. \nA pilot subproject for road maintenance  was launched under Tranche 4 to provide periodic maintenance for a 50 \nkm  section  of  the  Kabul\u2013Jalalabad  highway  from  Kabul  to  Surubi.  The  pilot  subproject  aims  to  (i)  assess  the \nMPW\u2019s overall O&M capacity, and (ii) develop a methodology that best suits the Afghan context and will be used in \nfuture  roads  O&M  projects.  The  maintenance  works  include  overlay  in  some  sections,  pothole  patching,  crack \nsealing, surface sealing, mill and fill, and roadside maintenance. \n\n4  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n\n\fFinancing of the second project is envisaged to be considered through the additional financing \nmodality  if  this  project  is  being  implemented  well  and  bringing  the  results  and  sustainability  to \nthe country\u2019s road asset management system.  \n \nThe project is fully consistent with the government\u2019s transport strategy and development \n9. \nplans (footnotes 1 and 2), and will help achieve the results of the country partnership strategy, \n2009\u20132013  and  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132015.5 The  project  is  also  included \nin  the  country  operations  business  plan  2016\u20132018.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  the \nCentral  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  20206 \nand will contribute to achieving goals 3 (good health and well-being) and 9 (industry, innovation, \nand infrastructure) of the Sustainable Development Goals.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  impact  is  aligned  with  increased  sustainability  of  the  Afghanistan\u2019s  road \n\n10. \ntransport sector. The outcome will be improved road connectivity and safety. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  national  highways  in  the  southeastern  region  maintained,  and  \n\n11. \n(ii) O&M and road asset management capacity enhanced.  \n \n12. \nTwo sections of the national highways (para. 7), a total of approximately 220 km, will be \nmaintained. The methodology used for the pilot subproject (footnote 3) will be adopted for the \nmaintenance work. It is expected that the maintenance will improve the IRI to 4-5. The proposed \nRAMS\u2019s  activities  include  the  design,  development,  and  trial  deployment  of  the  system.  This \nincludes  the  proper  design  and  harmonization  of  the  existing  geographic  information  system \ndatabases to combine them into one database under the MPW to support the use of the RAMS \nas  a  sound  decision-support  tool  to  plan  and  manage  roads  O&M.  Adequate  information  and \ncommunication technology infrastructure, including equipment and a single network that covers \nboth within the MPW and between the MPW and its provincial offices, will be provided. Finally, \nclassroom  and  on-the-job  training  using  the  RAMS  will  be  provided  to  enhance  the  technical \ncapacity of MPW staff in all aspects of the system.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \n(Table 1).  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $26.0 million, including taxes, duties, and contingencies \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

The detailed  maintenance  and  repair  methodology  is  based  on \nthe original methodology developed for the pilot O&M subproject. After a thorough assessment \nby  the  RAMS  consultants,  the  RAMS  database  will  be  built  up  from  the  inventory  being \nconducted  under  the  NRAP  financed  by  the  World  Bank.  The  major  cost  of  the  RAMS  is \nenvisaged  to  be  the  system\u2019s  hardware,  which  must  have  adequate  capacity  to  support  the \nsoftware and database.  \n \n18. \nPreliminary  climate  risk  screening  shows  that  the  project\u2019s  climate  change  risk  is \nmedium.  The  project  scope  only  includes  the  partial  overlay  and  repair  of  pavement. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nNevertheless,  the  development  of  awareness  of  climate  risks  and  knowledge  of  mitigation \nmeasures for the road project design will be considered under the RAMS component. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nThe project will help achieve the envisaged benefits of the improved transport corridor, \nincluding lower transport costs and shorter travel times. The economic evaluation of the project \nwas  undertaken  using  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects11 and  following \nthe  analytical  framework  of  the  highway  development  and  management  model.12 The  traffic \nforecast  is based  on  traffic  counts conducted  on  the  project  road  in  early  2015.  Based  on  the \n2015 average daily traffic volume, annual normal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2016\u20132035. \nProject  costs  and  benefits  are  calculated  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The economic costs are capital cost, including physical contingencies, but excluding \ntaxes  and  O&M.  The  economic  benefits  are  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  resulting  from  the \nimproved  project  road  and  time  savings.  The  economic  analysis  showed  that  the  project  is \neconomically  feasible  with  a  high  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  33.4%.  This \nconfirms  past  ADB  experience  with  maintenance  projects,  which  are  known  to  generate  high \neconomic returns. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain feasible should the \nenvisaged project costs increase or benefits be reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken \nbecause the project road will not generate revenue. \n \n20. \nThe proposed project addresses the two financial sustainability concerns: the lack of an \neffective  O&M  regime,  and  a  chronic  shortage  of  funds  for  O&M.  Government  funding  for \nmaintenance is unlikely to meet the requirements to preserve the value of the road assets. The \ngovernment would have to raise more than $200 million to meet the annual maintenance needs \nof  its  core  road  network.  Given  the  country\u2019s  narrow  economic  base  and  competing  needs  on \nscarce  budget  resources,  Afghanistan  will  have  to  rely  on  donor  contributions  to  finance  road \nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. Increased funds for O&M are necessary, although not \nsufficient,  to  ensure  road  asset  sustainability.  The  government  was  able  to  collect  $83  million \nrecently  through  road  user  fees  and  taxes,  more  needs  to  be  done.  A  RAMS  to  provide  a \nrigorous framework for managing future maintenance will be developed in conjunction with the \nproject. \n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nGovernance risks are a major challenge in Afghanistan. The project has been designed \nto  mitigate  these  risks,  especially  in  the  areas  of  financial  management  and  procurement.  An \nupdated  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MPW  and  its  PMO  took  into  consideration \ntheir  overall  capacity,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  governance,  staffing,  budgeting, \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial  information \nsystems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. This assessment found that, from a \nfinancial management perspective, the overall control risk is moderate, and that the MPW and \nPMO  have  adequate  experience  and  capacity in  financial management  to  manage  the  project \nfunds  as  well  as  adequate  fund  flow,  accounting,  and  budgeting  arrangements.  The  2015 \nrestructuring  of  the  PMO  has  significantly  improved  its  overall  capacity.  The  PMO\u2019s  finance \ndepartment  staff  includes  a  manager,  five  accountants,  and  a  trainee.  The  MPW  conducts \ninternal audits periodically annual external audits have yielded satisfactory results since ADB\u2019s \nengagement  with  the  MPW  in  2003.  The  MPW  is  responsible  for  ensuring  an  adequate  audit \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Paris. \n\n\ftrail, for which annual financial statements are audited by an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB in accordance with auditing standards. \n \n22. \nImprovement  is  needed  in  the  areas  of  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  and  \nreporting and monitoring. In the area of accounting policies and procedures, the PMO has been \nusing a manual book accounting approach, which is being outperformed by modern accounting \nsoftware.  In  the  area  of  reporting  and  monitoring,  the  PMO  has  demonstrated  capacity  to \nmonitor and report project finances based on ADB requirements. However, some delays in the \nsubmission  of  audited  project  financial  statements  have  occurred.  Thus,  the  updated  financial \nmanagement assessment recommended that (i) modern accounting software be procured and \ninstalled as soon as possible so that the relevant PMO staff can be trained in its use; and (ii) an \ninternational  financial  management  specialist  be  recruited  to  help  PMO  staff  conduct  financial \nmanagement,  ensuring  that  the  audited  project  financial  statements  are  submitted  in  a  more \ntimely manner. Financial management risks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and \nupdated throughout the project\u2019s life. \n \nAll goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n23. \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The government requested and ADB agreed to manage \nthe  RAMS  component,  procure  the  RAMS,  and  recruit  the  consultants.  This  will  ensure  the \ntransparency  of  the  procurement  process  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  delays,  especially  of  the \nRAMS  component  of  which  most  activities  are  on  the  implementation  plan\u2019s  critical  path.  The \nMPW  will  remain  responsible  for  negotiating  and  signing  the  contracts,  issuing  the  notice  to \nproceed,  and  supervising  the  contracts.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 10).  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MOF,  and  MPW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n25. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  conducted  for  the  project  revealed  the  extent  of \npoverty in the country, including, among other factors, (i) a high rate of food insecurity affecting \none-third  of  the  population,  (ii)  a  lack  of  access  to  improved  water  resources,  and  (iii)  limited \naccess to education and health services. The gender assessment revealed high maternal and \ninfant mortality rates, limited mobility of women compared to that of men and overall low status \nof  women.  While  the  project\u2019s  long-term  impact  is  expected  to  improve  women\u2019s  physical \naccess  to  education,  health,  and  other  services  by  shortening  travel  times  and  making  roads \nsafer,  these  benefits  are  indirect.  The  project  will  ensure  equal  pay  to  work  for  both  men  and \nwomen. The project is categorized as no gender elements. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nAll  three  safeguard  categories  are  categorized  as  C  since  (i)  no  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement is required, as the maintenance work will be carried out within the right \nof  way  of  existing  roads;  (ii)  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  by  ADB  for  operational \npurposes, live within the project area; and (iii) the environmental impact will be minimal, and will \nnot  require  a  related  action.  Thus,  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  indigenous \npeoples  plan,  or  initial  environment  assessment  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  will  be \nrequired. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \n Implementation of periodic \nmaintenance has been \nlimited by weak capacity \nand inadequate budget \nflows, resulting in \nunsustainability of road \nmaintenance \nPolitical instability across \nthe country \nWeak implementing \nagency \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27. \nThe  major  residual  risk  is  political  stability  of  the  country,  which  has  induced  security \nthreats  to  development  operation.  With  the  proposed  mitigation  measures,  the  overall  risk \nassessment  is  moderate,  while  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.13  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nMitigating Measures \n Development partners are helping the government to create a \nroad authority, road fund, and transportation institute.
