An Environmental Management System Framework \nAssessment  was prepared (Appendix 5). \n   \nProject Description  The Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project \n(SMERDP) is aimed at accelerating the development of small and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs)  located  outside  the  urbanized \nwestern province (Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts) by \nimproving  their  access  to  credit  and  business  development \nservices (BDS), as well as by catalyzing development of SME \nvalue  chain  clusters  for  providing  linkages  to  information, \ntechnology, and markets. The SMERDP also seeks to reinforce \ncorporate governance and strengthen risk management in private \ncommercial or specialized banks (PCBs). \n   \nRationale  The major development challenge in Sri Lanka today is a growing \nregional divide in terms of employment and economic growth. The \ngross regional domestic product of the western province is nearly \ntwo to four times those of the other three provinces. As a result, \nunemployment, underemployment, and the incidence of poverty in \nthese three provinces are much higher than those of the western \nprovince. Accordingly, the policy priority of the Government of Sri \nLanka  (the  Government)  is  to  foster  economic  development \noutside the western province to address regional inequalities.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s development agenda for the underdeveloped \nprovinces recognizes the private sector as the engine for growth \nand employment. Regional SMEs\u2014meaning SMEs outside the \nwestern  province\u2014comprise  75%  of  the  country\u2019s  30,000 \nregistered SMEs. Regional SMEs account for most of the private \nsector in the underdeveloped provinces.  \n \nAn  investment  climate  assessment  conducted  jointly  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the World Bank in December 2004 \nindicates that while Sri Lanka compares well in South Asia for its \nskilled  labor  and  ease  of  doing  business,  access  to  credit \n(particularly medium- to long-term credit) remains for SMEs a key \nconstraint. Lack of credit access is more marked in the provinces \noutside the western province, where credit availability meets only \n40%  of  the  existing  demand.  Regional  SMEs\u2019  competitiveness ", "ii  \nalso suffers disproportionately from limited access to technology \nand markets, as well as from poor infrastructure services. As a \nresult, they are unable to realize their full potential to grow and \ngenerate employment.  \n \nBy  providing  access  to  medium-  to  long-term  funds  and \nencouraging the PCBs to proactively seek financing opportunities \namong regional SMEs, the SMERDP seeks to redress existing \nregional imbalances and enhance the growth and development of \nregional  SMEs.  Simultaneously,  access  to  BDS  can  foster \nlinkages to appropriate technology and target markets. Access to \nscale economies, equity, and skills can be facilitated through the \ndevelopment of SME value chain clusters.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the proposed SMERDP is reduction in regional \ninequalities  through  the  accelerated  development  of  regional \nSMEs  thereby  enhancing  private  sector  share  in  economic \ndevelopment. The SMERDP\u2019s specific and immediate expected \noutcome is accelerated development of the SME sector outside \nthe western province through increased output and employment \ngeneration. \n   \nComponents   The SMERDP comprises a credit facility for enhancing access to \nmedium- to long-term financing through PCBs to eligible regional \nSMEs  and  SME  value  chain  clusters.  The  credit  facility  is \nsupplemented by three complementary components that seek to \nreinforce  PCB  corporate  governance,  strengthen  PCB  risk \nmanagement, and foster regional SME bankability. \n   \nInvestment Plan  The Project\u2019s estimated investment cost is $88.89 million, with \nADB contributing 56.25%. \n \nFinancing Plan   \n  Total \nSource  ($ million)    % \nADB  50.00    56.25 \nPCBs  16.67    18.75 \nSMEs  22.22    25.00 \n  Total  88.89    100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PCB = private commercial or \nspecialized bank, SME = small and medium enterprise. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nFinancing  will  include  a  loan  of  SDR  32,226,000  ($50  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. It will include \nsuch other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n   ", "  iii   \nAllocation and Relending  The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will make the ADB \nTerms  loan available through the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to \nthe PCBs at the average weighted deposit rate under a subsidiary \nloan agreement. The Government has requested that the loan \nterm (from the Government to PCBs) should not exceed 20 years. \n \nThe ADB loan will be relent by the Government to PCBs in local \ncurrency. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \nPCBs will onlend the funds to eligible regional SMEs and SME \nvalue chain clusters. The PCBs will onlend the money at interest \nrates reflecting their costs of funds plus a spread that covers \ntransaction costs and risk-adjusted returns. The ADB loan will be \nallocated to PCBs in the following indicative amounts (in dollar \nequivalents):  (i)  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited,  $15.0 \nmillion; (ii) DFCC Bank, $15.0 million; (iii) National Development \nBank  of  Sri  Lanka  PLC,  $10  million;  and  (iv)  Sampath  Bank \nLimited, $10 million. The PCB loans are to be disbursed over 3 \nyears, subject to a midterm review after 18 months to evaluate \ndisbursement progress. Another review will be undertaken at the \nend  of  3  years,  at  which  point  other  eligible  PCBs  could  be \nconsidered if any of the four PCBs fails to perform satisfactorily. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) \n   \nImplementation  Each  eligible  PCB  will  be  an  implementing  agency  and  will \nArrangements  establish a project implementation unit in its relevant operational \ndepartment. The MOFP will establish a project steering committee \n(PSC) that will oversee implementation of the Project. The PSC \nwill  comprise  six  members,  including  representatives  of  the \nMOFP, CBSL, and the four PCBs.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time),  as  these  relate  to  financial  intermediary  loans. \nSubborrowers  will  be  required  to  undertake  procurement  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices that are acceptable to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  There  are  significant  benefits  in  pursuing  private  sector-led \nBeneficiaries  regional SME development. The SMERDP\u2019s main benefits are \n(i) SME-driven  increased  regional  employment  and  output; \n(ii) enhanced  business  opportunities  for  regional  SMEs,  SME \nvalue  chain  clusters,  SME  BDS  providers,  and  PCBs  through \nimproved access to credit; (iii) enhanced capabilities of PCBs and \ntheir SME credit staff in SME financing operations as well as in \nrisk mitigation, project appraisal, supervision, credit and portfolio \n ", "iv  \nadministration for small loans; (iv) expanded SME portfolios of \nPCBs; and (v) through greater interaction as part of the SMERDP, \nimproved operational governance of PCBs due to closer central \nbank monitoring and supervision, as well as transaction-based \naccountability  for  corporate  governance  and  anti-money \nlaundering. Through support for SME value chain clusters, the \nSMERDP will also benefit from the mapping of SME value chain \nclusters undertaken by development partners. The SMERDP is \nexpected  to  generate  employment  for  approximately  50,000 \npeople  from  mid-2008  to  mid-2011  as  well  as  annual  output \namounting to about 2.0% of the 2005 SME sector output.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Achieving the expected benefits and impacts depends on several \nassumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  risks. \nMitigation  measures  are  being  put  in  place wherever  feasible. \nEscalation of conflict could pose risks for regional SMEs should \nareas outside the current conflict zone become involved. While \nthe PCBs stand ready to lend to SMEs in the conflict-affected \nareas, such lending would be undertaken only as the security \nsituation  permits  and  the  PCBs  perceive  the  risks  to  be \nacceptable.  \n \nDelinquency  risks  that  PCBs  face  in  expanding  regional  SME \nportfolios  are  mitigated  through  (i)  improved  access  to  credit \ninformation,  (ii)  better  use  of  collaterals,  (iii)  strengthened \ngovernance  structures  and  risk  management  practices,  (iv) \nrisk-based pricing, and (v) CBSL monitoring. \n \nRisk  associated  with  the  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  in  some \nlocations could affect utilization of the SMERDP facility. This risk \nis mitigated through access to BDS and introducing lead firms in \nSME value chain clusters that will inject equity, know-how, and \nmarketing into SMEs. In addition, ADB assessment indicates that \nPCBs  have  significant  lending  opportunities  to  viable  regional \nSMEs.  \n \nAlthough the demand for SME credit is robust, there could be \nimplementation delays in case the eligible PCBs would refocus \ntheir  priorities  and/or  fail  to  sustain  expected  performance \nstandards. These risks have been addressed by assessing PCB \neligibility and commitment upfront. In addition, the Project enables \nsubstitution of PCBs in case of performance shortcomings. \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Small and Medium Enterprise Regional \nDevelopment Project (SMERDP). The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Macroeconomic Context. The economy of Sri Lanka witnessed an impressive 7.2% gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in 2006. GDP growth has been consistently above 5.5% since \n2003. The per capita income, at $1,355 in 2006, is the highest in South Asia. While in the 1990s \ngrowth was driven by the manufacturing sector, since 2001 services have taken over the lead in \neconomic  growth.  These  include  in  particular  telecommunication,  transportation,  and  financial \nservices. However, rural and agriculture sectors have remained stagnant. Moreover, high inflation \nand a large fiscal deficit remain concerns. In addition, a financing gap persists with the country\u2019s \ndomestic savings falling far short of its investment needs.  \n \n3.  Development  Challenge.  Notwithstanding  the  economic  growth,  regional  inequalities \nrepresent a major development challenge in Sri Lanka. The per capita gross regional domestic \nproduct of $1,467 in the western province, the most developed of the four provinces, is some two \nto four times those of other provinces. The share of the western province in the total economy has \nincreased while the contribution of the other three provinces has declined. Unemployment fell to \n6.4% in 2006 from 8.3% in 2004,1 but youth unemployment is a particularly critical problem. Nearly \n80% of the unemployed (and mostly outside the western province) are in the age group of 15\u201329 \nyears. The overall poverty incidence is 22.7%. \n \n4.  The ongoing conflict accentuates regional disparities and exacerbates poverty. The share \nof households living below the poverty line in the western province (9.2%) is less than half of those \nin all other provinces (18.1% to 31.8%).2 The indirect and direct economic costs of the ongoing \nconflict in the north and east are estimated to reduce the growth by 2 percentage points per \nannum. The strain on government resources adds to the crowding out of the private sector and \nalso constrains public expenditure for development. Adverse effects on business confidence due to \nthe conflict impede both domestic and foreign private sector investment.  \n \n5.  Development Paradigm. Expanded roles for foreign direct investment and public-private \npartnerships are critical elements of the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s (the Government) development \nagenda.  The  narrowing  fiscal  space  is  prompting  growing  reliance  on  the  private  sector  for \ninvestments and service delivery. The Government is cognizant that a well-functioning small and \nmedium enterprise (SME) sector could take the lead in generating jobs and economic growth while \nraising income levels for a large segment of the population. Since regional3 SMEs (i.e., SMEs \noutside the western province) comprise 75% of the total number of registered SMEs in the country, \nthe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  SMEs  in  equitable  regional  growth.  However, \nregional  SMEs  have  not  realized  their  full  potential  for  contributing  to  economic  growth  and \nemployment generation. Accordingly, regional SME development is one of the key elements of the \n                                                 \n1  The latest census excludes the north and east, and therefore the figures are not strictly comparable. \n2  Sri Lanka Department of Census and Statistics. 2002. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Colombo. The \npoverty line is calculated as SLRs1,423 per month, based on the cost of basic needs methodology. Data is not \navailable for the northern and eastern provinces. \n3  The term \u201cregional\u201d in the context of this document denote all provinces except the western one.  ", "2  \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy  for  reducing  regional  inequalities  in  its  10-year  (2006\u20132016)  National \nDevelopment Strategy, the Mahinda Chintana: Vision for New Sri Lanka.  \n \n6.  SMEs. There are nearly 30,000 registered SMEs4 in Sri Lanka, three fourths of which are \nregional SMEs. Estimates of the SMEs in the informal sector or unregistered is much higher. At the \nsector  level,  SMEs  account  for  65%  of  total  tea  production,  50%  of  apparel  and  garment \nmanufacturing, more than 70% of the road transportation sector, 80% of domestic trade activities, \n45% of tourism and recreation services, and 50% of the local construction industry. It is estimated \nthat one third of the total number of SMEs produce for export markets. Following is a broad \nsegregation of SME types:  \n \n(i)  Small informal enterprises typically employ 5 to 9 persons and are largely family \nbased.  Having  grown  from  microenterprises,5 these  enterprises  use  significant \nportions  of  their  business  revenues  to  invest  in  expansion.  Typically,  these \nenterprises lack access to formal credit and support services. Access to formal \ncredit  and business  development  services  (BDS)  could  help  realize  the  growth \npotential. \n(ii)  Small formal sector enterprises typically employ 6 to 49 persons and have well-\nestablished  relationships  with  larger  manufacturing  and  trading  concerns.  While \nsignificant  growth  potential  exists,  they  face  leadership  and  management \nchallenges. Sources of finance are usually retained earnings and supplier credits.  \n(iii)  Medium-sized enterprises typically employ between 50 and 150 persons and serve \nas  a  link  between  the  formal  and  informal  economies  through  well-established \nsupplier and buyer relationships with small formal and informal SMEs, as well as \nwith  large  domestic  and  international  corporate  entities.  Although  professionally \nmanaged, there is a need to maintain competitiveness. Access to finance remains \nconstrained even for this category of SMEs.  \n \n7.  The vision and strategies for SME development in Sri Lanka explicitly address the concerns \nof entrepreneurs in the SME sector within the national economic and social framework as set out in \nthe 10-year National Development Strategy (2006\u20132016). The Ministry of Enterprise Development \nand Investment Promotion (MEDIP) facilitates measures to promote development, growth, and \ninternational competitiveness in the SME sector as an integral part of the national economy. All \npolicy and programming initiatives for the SME sector are designed to be consistent with and \ncomplementary to the existing policy initiatives of other key ministries. The Government also \nestablished  the  National  Enterprise  Development  Authority  (NEDA),  with  private  sector \nparticipation, to coordinate SME development interventions implemented by various agencies and \ngovernment levels.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  For this document, SMEs are defined as those employing between 10 and 150 staff. Definitions of SMEs vary \nconsiderably and have also evolved. In terms of the total value of assets, the definition proposed by the Task Force for \nSMEs (December 2002) classified (i) small enterprises as those with fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of \nSLRs1 million to SLRs20 million; and (ii) medium-scale enterprises as enterprises with fixed asset value, excluding \nland and buildings, of SLRs20 million to SLRs50 million. However, the definition adopted by banks suggests the need \nfor a more liberal enterprise fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of SLRs100 million (about $1 million) to \nappropriately capture the full extent of the SMEs in Sri Lanka.  \n5  Typically employ up to four persons, mostly from the same family. Activities include handicraft, shops, trade, and \nservices, and often at the premises of the owners. ", "    3    \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Analysis of Key Problems \n \n8.  An investment climate assessment6 indicates that Sri Lanka fares well on indicators such \nas skilled labor force and ease of starting business compared to other developing countries. \nHowever, political stability, quality of infrastructure, and predictability of labor regulations affect \ninvestment  inflows.7 From  a  development  perspective,  the  assessment  emphasizes  that  rural \nSMEs make a large contribution to GDP (12%) and represented 78% of agricultural GDP in 2003. \nNearly 72.2% of the population lives in rural areas.8 The potential for SME-driven regional growth is \nparticularly marked in the sectors of fisheries, dairies, spices, leather and footwear, coir, fruits and \nvegetables, as well as packaging. However, regional SMEs also have restricted access to finance \nand, compared to SMEs in the western province, generate lower employment as well as lower \nquantity and quality of output (please refer to Appendix 2 for a more detailed analysis of the SME \nsector).  \n \na.  Access to Bank Credit  \n \n9.  Banks are the main providers of SME credit, and especially four private commercial  or \nspecialized  banks  (PCBs):  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  (CB),  DFCC  Bank  (DFCC), \nNational Development Bank of Sri Lanka PLC (NDB), and Sampath Bank Limited (SB). Also \nimportant are two state-owned banks: the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and People\u2019s Bank.9 Compared to \nstate-owned banks, the regional SME portfolios of PCBs represent higher proportions of their total \nportfolios.10 Despite PCBs\u2019 relatively smaller regional branch networks,11 their better operational \nefficiencies12 enable PCBs to cover larger areas per branch compared to the state-owned banks. \nSME lending by public sector banks is in instances under government-sponsored programs.  \n \n10.  Notwithstanding the coverage by the banks, an overall limited access to formal credit \nremains the strongest constraint on SMEs. In Sri Lanka, the industrial and agricultural sectors \nreceive only 10% and 4% of total bank financing, respectively. Only 35% of registered regional \nSMEs are estimated to have access to formal finance. The overall supply-demand gap for SME \ncredit is estimated at 50% nationally, and 60% outside the western province. The access to bank \ncredit improves with increasing firm size. Start-up SMEs find it even harder to borrow from banks,13 \nand even SMEs that have access are able to borrow much less than their investment needs.  \n \n11.  Around 65% of total SME lending volume by all banks in Sri Lanka is short-term credit, \nwhile the remaining 35% is medium- to long-term credit. Due to the relatively small equity market \nand  nascent  long-term  debt  market,  financial  institutions  like  banks  are  unable  to  mobilize \n                                                 \n6  ADB and World Bank. 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate. Sri Lanka.  \n7  Compared with Malaysia and Thailand, where annual investment inflows are about 3% of GDP, inflows in Sri Lanka \naveraged 1.3% of GDP during 1990\u20132002. \n8  Sri Lanka Department of Census and Statistics. 2002. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Colombo. \n9  Sri Lanka has a wide range of financial institutions, which number approximately 96, but the discussions in this \ndocument are confined to banks that meet the eligibility criteria set by ADB for participation in the SMERDP. A \nseparate loan is being processed for Bank of Ceylon (BOC).  \n10 On average, SME lending as a percentage of total lending and the number of regional SME loans as a proportion of \ntotal SME loans is greater for the four PCBs.  \n11 The number of regional branches of the four PCBs, at 107, although less than the 212 branches of BOC, are also well \ndispersed throughout the country. \n12 In terms of average processing time (i.e., the number of days from submitting a loan application to funds disbursal). \n13 Only 14% of working capital for small firms in Sri Lanka is financed by bank loans compared to 30% for medium firms. \nUtilization of bank credit by manufacturers employing fewer than 100 employees is just 7%. Only 11% of new SME \ninvestment in Sri Lanka is financed through bank loans. \n ", "4  \nadequate long-term funding domestically. With an international credit rating below investment \ngrade, Sri Lanka also has limited access to the international financial markets.  \n \n12.  SME lending is heavily concentrated in the western province, which limits the potential of \nregional development. Despite having regional branch networks, and due to perceived higher risk \nof lending in other parts of the country, banks have historically concentrated SME lending to the \nmore urbanized western province. Regional SMEs\u2019 relatively smaller size and their geographic \nlocations increase unit transaction costs. Moreover, reliable credit information is often lacking. As a \nresult,  the  banks  require  substantially  larger  spreads  than  are  offered  to  established,  larger \nenterprises. Venture capital companies are also reluctant to invest in SMEs, due to an absence of \ncredible sponsors and information. The poor past performance of venture capital companies that \ndid invest in a few SMEs discourages further investments.  \n \n     b.  Enabling Environment  \n \n13.  While  the  Government  has  successively  taken  measures  for  enhancing  the  operating \nenvironment for SMEs, some gaps and weaknesses still need to be addressed. These include: \n \n(i)  Inadequate and unreliable credit information. The available information and track \nrecord of a potential SME borrower is limited, as credit rating agencies and credit \ninformation bureaus do not cover their operations. Meanwhile, in most cases the \nsystems of internal financial accounting in SMEs are weak. The resulting information \nasymmetry prevents banks from reasonably assessing SMEs\u2019 creditworthiness. As \na result, the banks rely heavily on collateral, and especially in the form of land, when \nconsidering SME loan proposals.  \n(ii)  Lack of a framework and system for securing movables. SME entrepreneurs \ntypically have little land to offer by way of collateral, but they have movable property \nranging from equipment to inventory to receivables. However, the absence of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  to  allow  financial  institutions  to  secure  their  lending \nagainst such security is a constraint. Linked to this is the lack of a central registry to \nensure the integrity of such collaterals. While registries for movable property do \nexist in Sri Lanka, they are many and dispersed throughout the country. Each \ndistrict has its own registry, making it difficult for banks to keep track of pledged \ncollateral nationwide.  \n \nc.  Nonfinancial Constraints  \n \n14.  SMEs\u2019 growth prospects are also impeded by a lack of access to nonfinancial inputs, low \nlevels of technology absorption, and weak management.  \n \n(i)  Nonfinancial inputs. Since the mid-1980s, Sri Lanka has undertaken liberalization \npolicies. Barriers to entry have been reduced and import restrictions have been \nbrought down. In a number of sectors, however, a lack of uniform grading and \nsorting, poor packaging, and weak supply chains result in extensive post-harvest \nwaste from spoilage. Smaller firms that cannot manage their supply chains do not \nfind it easy to obtain access to adequate quantity and quality of raw materials and \nintermediate inputs. \n(ii)  Managerial, technical, and marketing constraints. As in many other developing \ncountries, SMEs in Sri Lanka often begin as family-owned and family-operated ", "    5    \nbusinesses.14 In  addition,  SMEs  are  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  research  and \ndevelopment  as  well  as  vocational  training  required  for  improved  harvesting \nmethods  and  consequent  product  quality.  SMEs,  and  especially  start-ups,  face \ndifficulties in upgrading technology and locating buyers for their products.  \n \nd.  Physical Infrastructure Constraint  \n \n15.  The quality of and access to infrastructure plays an important role in the establishment, \noperation, and expansion of an enterprise. Sri Lankan firms have identified poor infrastructure, like \nroads and unreliable power, as the primary hindrances for doing business (footnote 6). In addition \nto the bottlenecks in medium- to large-scale infrastructure, SMEs are often constrained by a lack of \nsupporting  small-scale  infrastructure  such  as,  for  example,  fishing  harbors,  common  market \nfacilities, and small non-vehicular bridges. Inadequate physical infrastructure is even more acute \noutside the western province. This exacerbates regional disparity as inadequate infrastructure \nfacilities add to SMEs\u2019 costs of doing business, reduce their productivity, and limit their expansion.  \n \n2.  Analysis of Opportunities \n \n16.  Regional  economic  disparity  is  of  enormous  economic  and  political  significance  in  Sri \nLanka. With the availability of medium- to long-term funds, there arises considerable interest \namong the banks in exploring SME financing opportunities beyond the western province. This \nmakes a business case for banks to both diversify and to expand their portfolios outside the \nwestern  province\u2019s  crowded  banking  sector.  As  critical  as  access  to  credit  is,  however,  its \ndevelopment impact depends on reform measures, both financial and nonfinancial. \n \na.  Enhancing the Enabling Environment \n \n 17.  Credit Information. The Government is facilitating the conversion of the manual format at \nCredit Rating Information Bureau (CRIB) to a web-based electronic-enabled system by the end of \n2007 to ensure availability of credit history for all SMEs at the CRIB. These efforts will enable \ncoverage of all SME borrowers and will help the banks to shift from purely collateral-based lending \nto cash flow-based lending that emphasizes greater reliance on character, better understanding of \nthe business, and credit rating information at the outset of the credit relationship with SMEs.15 \nCredit information will also facilitate adoption of credit scoring methods by lenders to reduce \nappraisal time and cost. \n \n18.  Securing  Movables.  The  Government  is  also  pursuing  enactment  of  a  secured \ntransactions bill and the establishment of a national system of registry as part of ADB\u2019s ongoing \nFinancial Markets for Private Sector Development Program16 to enable SMEs to use their movable \nproperty as collaterals. Enactment is expected in March 2008, and CRIB will be assigned the \nfunction of registry for securing movable property.  \n \n                                                 \n14 SMEs with professional managers are more successful in consolidating and expanding their businesses. ADB and \nWorld Bank. 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate. Sri Lanka. \n15 Support for cash flow-based lending, however, does not mean the elimination of collateral. The basis for credit in cash \nflow-based lending is not the collateral offered by the borrower but rather the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan (i.e., \nSMEs can obtain credit on the strength of their creditworthiness). Less restrictive covenants can be utilized, such as \npari passu treatment for all creditors or the guarantee of the owners instead of requiring hard collateral. Having such a \nsystem in place could serve as an incentive for SMEs in the informal sector to move to the formal sector.      \n16 ADB. 2004. Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. Manila (R265-04).  \n ", "6  \nb.  Improving Access to Nonfinancial Inputs  \n \n19.  SME Value Chain Clusters. SME value chain clusters are essentially economic groupings \nthat comprise a group cluster of SMEs in a particular sector around a lead firm.17 SME value chain \nclusters entail vertical integration that allows for transactional and technological efficiencies as well \nas enhanced economies of scale. For the SME, benefits include (i) enhanced economies of scale \nthrough bulk purchasing and coordinated product promotion, (ii) improved market access, (iii) \nadoption  of  the  industry\u2019s  best  practices  and  technological  efficiencies,  (iv)  marketing  and \nmanagerial knowledge, and (v) greater certainty of buyers for the SME\u2019s products and services. \nFurthermore, lead firms can trigger dialogue with equity firms or venture capital companies, for \npurposes of needs-based equity partnerships in new SME businesses. SME value chain clusters \nalso facilitate access to bank finance on account of better business prospects. For the lead firms, \nthe cluster strengthens forward and backward linkages as well as provides economies of scale. \nMapping for SME value chain clusters in illustrative sectors have been undertaken by development \npartners18 for the coir, spices, rubber, ceramics, tea, gems and jewelry, information technology, \norganic products, and tourism segments. Access to credit for such SME value chain clusters will \nenhance the prospects for the underdeveloped provinces as well as for the clusters themselves.  \n \n20.  SME Value Chain Cluster Concept in Sri Lanka. In the fisheries sector, for example, the \nformation of SME value chain cluster between groups of fisher folk and a lead firm (processing \nplant) facilitates access to formal finance for the fisher folk since the banks are more assured of the \nsuccess of enterprise with the presence of a lead firm as part of the cluster. For the fisher folks, this \narrangement enhances productivity through upgrading of boats (from one day to multi day boats) \nand provision of cold storage on the boats. Ultimately, the fisher folk benefit from higher return on \ninvestments in terms of daily landed catch and less wastage. For the lead firm, the incentive is the \nbackward linkage enabling assured supply of raw material (i.e., supply of more fish).   \n \nc.  Providing Business Development Services  \n \n21.  MEDIP has established five centers throughout the country to assist SMEs in obtaining \nBDS,  including  outsourcing  activities  (e.g.,  payroll  and  accounting),  information  technology \nservices, technical services (e.g., design and engineering), and financial brokering. A registry of \nBDS providers is available on the Government\u2019s web site.19 Survey findings20 indicate that only one \nthird of SMEs use BDS at least once in every 3 months, and the rest seldom or never use BDS. \nThe BDS most commonly used are legal and tax advice, business registration and licensing \nassistance, accounting services, and computer-related services. There is significant demand for \nBDS, and primarily for business management training, for preparing loan proposals and business \nand marketing plans, and for quality control. The SMEs feel the need for financing to acquire \nquality BDS services from reputable and competent commercial providers. This, in turn, would \nprovide an incentive for professional BDS providers to upgrade and enhance their skills. Greater \nuse of BDS by SMEs would help to diversify and broaden the availability of such services.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Lead firms are defined as corporations with (i) an established track record in the sector, or an established track record \nof effective diversification in other sectors; and (ii) offtake agreements to buy products or invest a majority equity stake \nin the new SME business as part of a value chain cluster.  \n18 Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeitand (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) and United \nStates Agency for International Development.  \n19 ADB. 2001.

Regional  infrastructure  development  is  critical  for  meeting  SMEs\u2019  needs  for  power, \ntransport, water, and sanitation. The Government recognizes the importance of improving and \nexpanding regional public infrastructure for sustaining economic and social development. In this \ncontext, the 2007 Budget allocates 5% of GDP per annum for infrastructure development over the \nnext  4  years.  Furthermore,  the  2007  Budget  announced  a  2.5%  regional  infrastructure \ndevelopment levy on the value of motor vehicles (inclusive of all taxes and duties) levied at the \npoint of customs. The Government is also keen to enhance the private sector\u2019s role in providing \ninfrastructure services through public-private partnerships.  \n \ne.  Financial Sector Reforms  \n \n23.  Sri Lanka\u2019s financial sector (Appendix 3) has grown rapidly in recent years, both in terms of \nthe number of institutions and the range of services offered. Foreign ownership of banks, insurance \ncompanies, and stockbrokerage firms have been permitted. Interest rates have been deregulated, \nprudential norms have been made more stringent, and credit ratings have been made mandatory. \nBanks have expanded their branch networks, and intense competition has led to rapid growth in \nvalue-added services. Within the financial sector, the PCBs are market leaders in products and \nservices. Mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances are becoming common among banks and \nother financial institutions.  \n \n24.  Through its ownership of BOC and People\u2019s Bank, the Government\u2019s presence remains \nsubstantial.  Although  the  financial  soundness  of  the  banking  system  has  improved,  the \nnonperforming loan ratio, at 12.6% in 2006, is still relatively high for state-owned banks. The \ninterest spread in Sri Lanka is the highest in South Asia,21 reflecting the need for improving banks\u2019 \noperational efficiency and risk management. Further, corporate governance, while significantly \nimproved, needs to be continuously strengthened. Progress in these areas is critical for facilitating \nthe adoption of Basel II. The current policy direction of Government is to commercialize the \noperations of the state-owned banks rather than privatize. \n \n25.  Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market is also small, with a market capitalization of about 25% of GDP. \nHowever, the capital market has proved resilient even in the face of political uncertainties. While \nthere is an active market for government securities, the private debt securities market is small. \nGovernment  control  of  the  long-term  savings  through  two  pension  funds  and  savings  banks \nenables it to preempt most savings for financing government borrowing, which constrains private \ndebt markets.  \n \n3.  The Government Strategy for Regional SME Development  \n26.  The  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  outlined  in  the  Mahinda  Chintana  combines \nmarket-based economic policies (including to attract foreign direct investments) with support for \ndomestic enterprises. The Government aims to pursue a gradual approach to reforms with the aim \nof building broad based ownership of such reforms. To achieve high growth rates, emphasis is on \ninvestments in infrastructure and a knowledge economy with a focus on regional development. A \ngreater role for the private sector underlies the development agenda.  \n \n27.  To bring dynamism in the SME sector in terms of new entrants and growth of established \nenterprises,  the  10-year  National  Development  Strategy  (2006-2016)  emphasizes  increasing \ninvestment in the SME sector and removing barriers to its growth through legislative and regulatory \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka: Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n ", "8  \nreforms. Further, the task force on national strategy for SME development outlined a framework \nthat  includes  (i)  an  enabling  environment  for  preparing  SMEs  to  meet  the  challenges  of  an \ninternationally  competitive  economy; 22  (ii)  facilitating  cooperation  and  synergies  among \nentrepreneurs wherever possible through developing SME value chain clusters; (iii) fostering stable \nand quality employment in SMEs by improving skills and technology; (iv) minimizing the imbalance \nbetween large-scale enterprises and SMEs, including to encourage integration through value and \nsupply  chains;  and  (v)  improving  income-  and  wealth-generating  opportunities  for  low-income \ngroups through enterprises.  \n \n28.  In order to address regional inequalities, the Government has advanced its commitment for \nfacilitating  regional  public  infrastructure  development  (para.  22).  Resources  have  also  been \nearmarked  in  the  budget  for  promoting  value  addition  in  SME  outputs  through  research  and \ndevelopment. In addition, import duty has been removed on machinery and equipment for sectors \nsuch  as  tea,  rubber,  and  coconut  coir.  To  enhance  credit  flow  for  SMEs  and  SME-related \ninfrastructure, the Government has also established Lanka Puthra Development Bank.  \n \n4.  Asian Development Bank Support for SME Development  \n \n29.  ADB has provided sustained support for the SME sector through efforts to broaden financial \nmarkets, fiscal improvement programs, and SME-focused interventions.23 Such long-term structural \nissues as developing the capital market and availability to the private sector of alternative sources \nof medium- to long-term funds are being addressed through ADB support. Continuing ADB support \nin  this  area  has  included  developing  contractual  savings  institutions,  alternative  sources  of \nmedium-  to  long-term  funds,  the  insurance  industry  and  pension  and  provident  funds,  and \nliberalization of these institutions\u2019 investments to include private securities in the capital market.  \n \n30.  Developing  securitized  debt  and  equities  markets  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (1990),  strengthening  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and \nintroducing a securitization bill as well as amendment to the Securities and Exchange Commission \nAct under the ongoing Financial Markets for Private Sector Development Program are all expected \nto  deepen  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  markets  while  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance. Simultaneously, the ongoing Fiscal Management Reform Program is helping create \nan enabling environment to foster tax revenues mobilization, improved effectiveness of public \nexpenditures, fiscal decentralization, and coordination to ultimately place public finances onto a \nsustainable path. These structural measures are long-term initiatives, the impact of which will only \ngradually take hold after continuous implementation. ADB is also providing extensive support for \ninfrastructure development24 involving ports, highways, and roads that cumulatively will enhance \nthe competitiveness of SMEs and provide the basis for a higher growth rate.  \n                                                 \n22 This would include cleaner production technologies and rationalizing regulation and taxes.  \n23 ADB. 2004.

Besides  the  SME  policy  unit  at  MEDIP,  the  ADB-financed  SME  Sector  Development \nProgram I25 also introduced polices to reduce the costs of operating and financing SMEs. These \npolicy changes include reducing the corporate income tax for SMEs, abolishing turnover tax on \nbanking and financing activities, harmonizing tax incentives, and abolishing stamp duty on letters \nof credit. Commercial legal reforms, such as the Bankruptcy Act, are underway to provide for court \nsupervised  restructuring  of  SMEs  in  the  event  of  financial  default.  In  addition,  an  integrated \napproach for enhancing SMEs\u2019 access to finance and BDS was initiated. The associated credit line \nwas fully utilized, but SMEs in the western province (footnote 25) benefited largely.  \n \n32.  Lessons  Learned.  An  Operations  Evaluation  Department  analysis  of  credit  lines26 \nhighlights that (i) it must be recognized that an underdeveloped domestic market for long-term \nfunds for SMEs exists, (ii) appropriate selection of effective private sector banks and selective use \nof performance-oriented state-owned banks are key to efficient delivery of SME subloans, and (iii) \nusing market-based onlending rates to SMEs is more effective than subsidized credit. \n \n5.  Donor Coordination \n \n33.  Private  sector  driven  regional  SME  development  to  generate  employment  is  widely \nconsidered as a priority intervention. Accordingly, technical assistance (TA) studies and capacity \nbuilding  for  fostering  bankable  SME  projects,  especially  through  a  SME  value  chain  cluster \napproach, have been encouraged by development partners in Sri Lanka.27, 28 ADB\u2019s TA study for \npreparing  the  SMERDP  was  coordinated  with  development  partners,  who  concurred  with  the \nsignificance of value chain clusters.29 The German Agency for Technical Cooperation and United \nStates Agency for International Development will recommend value chain clusters mapped and \ndeveloped under their projects for SMERDP financing (para. 55).  \n  \n34.  The SMERDP is designed to benefit from South Asia Enterprise Development Facility  \n(SEDF)30 interventions, funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for enhancing the \nPCBs\u2019 capacity for SME financing with regard to financing product development, risk management \npractices, and knowledge dissemination (paras. 46-47). The SMERDP design also incorporates \nexperience from the ongoing SME credit line from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \nPlease refer to Appendix 4 for the external coordination matrix. \n \n35.  Proposed SMERDP. A dynamic SME sector is needed to accelerate regional growth for \nemployment and private sector development. The contribution of regional SMEs to economic \ngrowth depends on financial and nonfinancial inputs for stimulating start-up SMEs, growth of \nestablished SMEs, and development of SME value chain clusters. The Government initiatives \n(paras. 26\u201328) and ADB\u2019s interventions for SME development as well as the ongoing financial and \nfiscal  reforms  and  infrastructure  investments  (paras.  29\u201331),  provide  the  opportunity  for \naccelerating regional SME development. \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2001.

Inadequate mobilization of medium- to long-term resources by the domestic market and the \nSME financing pattern that is skewed in favor of the western province have resulted in a demand-\nsupply gap for medium- to long-term credit for regional SMEs. Regional SMEs have bankable \ndemand for credit, and therefore access to adequate medium- to long-term credit is important for \nenabling them to benefit from economic opportunities by adopting new technologies and business \nprocesses. This, in turn, is important for increasing and diversifying the sources of income outside \nthe western province. Accordingly, and consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \n2005/2006 for Sri Lanka,31 the proposed SMERDP provides a credit facility to participating financial \ninstitutions (four PCBs) for lending on to SMEs located outside the western province. This will fill a \ncritical market gap and catalyze establishment and development of SME value chain clusters and \nprovision  of  commercial  BDS  for  SMEs.  The  SMERDP  builds  on  lessons  learned  in  SME \ndevelopment (para. 32) and is firmly anchored to the market with risk-based pricing consistent with \nBasel II requirements, as directed by CBSL.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n37.  The impact of the proposed SMERDP is reduction in regional inequalities through the \naccelerated development of regional SMEs thereby enhancing private sector share in economic \ndevelopment.  The  SMERDP\u2019s  specific  and  immediate  expected  outcome  is  accelerated \ndevelopment  of  the  SME  sector  outside  the  western  province  through  increased  output  and \nemployment generation. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project  \n1.  Outputs \n38.  The  Sri  Lankan  credit  market  suffers  from  a  dearth  of  medium-  to  long-term  funds. \nConstrained by the limited availability of matching term funds, the banks and financial institutions \nare reluctant to lend to regional SMEs. The objective of the SMERDP is to fill this critical market \ngap by providing medium- to long-term credit for SMEs, mainstreaming best practices in SME \nfinancing, creating SME value chain clusters as a medium for accelerated SME development, and \nimproving SMEs\u2019 access to nonfinancial inputs by providing BDS.  \n \n2.  Components \n39.  The SMERDP comprises a credit facility, the core component, for enhancing access to \nmedium- to long-term financing through PCBs to eligible regional SMEs and SME value chain \nclusters. The credit facility is supplemented by three complementary components that seek to \nreinforce PCB corporate governance, strengthen PCB risk management, and foster regional SME \nbankability.  \n  \na.  Core Component: Credit Facility  \n \n40.  Eligible PCBs. PCBs eligible to utilize the SMERDP credit facility are CB, DFCC, NDB, and \nSB. The eligible PCBs (i) demonstrated commitment and a proven track record of serving the SME \nmarket, (ii) met operational and financial eligibility criteria (including a credit rating of at least AA-, \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2004.

ADB reserves the right to disallow disbursements to any \neligible PCB for not conforming to any of the eligibility criteria, as outlined in Section A of Appendix \n6, until such time as the PCB is able to satisfy the established criteria. A due diligence analysis of \nthe eligible PCBs is also included in Appendix 6.  \n \n41.  The regional branch network of BOC, including its presence in conflict-affected areas, is \ngreater than those of all the eligible PCBs put together. BOC meets the eligibility criteria and has a \nrating better than some of the eligible PCBs. Considering the ongoing institutional and operational \nreforms at BOC, and in consultation with the Government, it was decided to separately explore a \nnonsovereign facility that will not only anchor BOC to international markets but also ensure that its \nbusiness  decisions  and  processes  align  with  international  best  practices. In  addition,  ADB  is \nexpanding the funding resources and financial services available to the SME sector in Sri Lanka \nthrough an earlier loan in 2007 to Lanka Orix company Limited, as well as through proposed loans \nto People\u2019s Leasing Company Limited and Commercial Leasing Company Limited. \n \n42.  Eligibility Criteria for Subborrowers. The following are eligible to access SMERDP credit \nfacility: \n \n(i)  Start-up SMEs as well as SMEs undertaking expansion or modernization, provided \ntheir annual turnover does not exceed SLRs300 million or their fixed assets do not \nexceed SLRs100 million (excluding land and building). \n(ii)  SME  value  chain  clusters  representing  economic  groupings  of  lead  firms  and \neligible SMEs, or commercially viable partnerships between a lead firm or lead firms \nand group of SMEs, for the purpose of achieving economies of scale through bulk \npurchasing  and  coordinated  product  promotion  by  the  lead  firm  or  enhanced \nimport/export competitiveness, market access, technology, and skills transfer from \nthe lead firm. \n \n43.  Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects. The subproject selection criteria have been designed \nfor outreach to regional SMEs as well SME value chain clusters. The subproject shall:  \n \n(i)  be located outside the western province; \n(ii)  be economically and financially viable;  for SMEs and SME value chain clusters; \n(iii)  either be for start-up, expansion, or modernization activities in any of the eligible \nsubsectors33 as agreed between Government and the ADB, or for financing BDS  \nrequirements34 of SMEs or SME value chain clusters;  \n(iv)  comply with Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies; \nand \n(v)  not  entail  any  activities  that  would  generate  involuntary  resettlement  whether \npermanent or temporary, including for squatters. \n                                                 \n32 Fitch Ratings Lanka (FRL) (formerly known as Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Lanka) pioneered credit ratings in Sri Lanka \non 5 October 1999.  .  \n33 Except those on the exclusion list of ADB (see Supplementary Appendix F), will include but not be limited to the \nfollowing sectors (leather products, fisheries, dairy, coconut coir, spices, fruits and vegetables, as well as packaging) \nthat have been selected on the basis of (i) domestic demand and export potential, (ii) factor endowments, (iii) potential \nfor development of pilot SME value chain clusters, and (iv) credit finance absorption capacity. Any PCB can, with \nadequate justification, request the inclusion of other sectors subject to Government and ADB approval. \n34 Include but are not limited to, providing key sector specific design, testing, standards certification (especially for \nexports), product development, and technology, as well as assistance in the operating functional areas of marketing, \nproduction, financial management and commercial skills transfer services.  \n ", "1 2 \n  b.  Complementary Component 1: Supporting PCB Governance \n44.  Role of CBSL. In addition to channeling the SMERDP credit facility, the CBSL has agreed \nto take an active role in strengthening the governance of eligible PCBs in consideration of its (i) \nready access to information pertaining to the continued eligibility of the PCBs, including their \nfinancial soundness and capabilities for providing credit to the SME sector; (ii) regulatory and \nsupervisory role over the PCBs; (iii) role in setting corporate governance standards for banks;35 \nand (iv) key role through its recently established Financial Intelligence Unit to combat money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism.36 \n \n45.  CBSL\u2019s role was discussed with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Both \nendorsed the strengthened governance on disbursements and utilization under the Project that \nwould be made possible as a result of CBSL monitoring. Supervision of Corporate Governance \nCode compliance involves regular on-site inspections of the PCBs by CBSL\u2019s Bank Supervision \nDepartment. The SMERDP will support further strengthening of PCB governance through active \ndialogue with the PCBs based on project steering committee (PSC, para. 63) assessment of the \non-site inspection reports with respect to (i) corporate governance structures that promote effective \nidentification, monitoring, and management of all material business risks; (ii) systems for ensuring \ncompliance  with  all  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements;  (iii)  implementation  of  financial \ndisclosure  requirements  for  market  participants  and  observers;  and  (iv)  setting  of  corporate \ngovernance objectives, strategies, and techniques. A PCB\u2019s unsatisfactory progress can lead to \ncancellation of its access to the SMERDP credit facility.  \n \n  c.  Complementary Component 2: Strengthening PCB Risk  \nManagement \n46.  Role of SEDF. PCBs need to strengthen their risk management procedures for their SME \nlending portfolios. Such efforts will, for example, require (i) greater reliance on cash flow and past \nperformance  as  bases  for  lending  to  regional  SMEs  instead  of  solely  using  collateral-based \nlending, (ii) increased application of SME credit scoring by PCBs and collaboration with domestic \nrating agencies, and (iii) risk-based loan pricing. The IFC\u2019s SEDF in Colombo has a key role in \nsupporting the PCBs in this regard.37 The SEDF\u2019s ongoing TA programs are enabling capacity \nbuilding  for  PCBs  on  risk  management,  process  reengineering,  streamlining  procedures,  and \ndeveloping new products.38 Utilizing the SEDF\u2019s capacity building complements SME financing \nunder the SMERDP.     \n \n47.  The PSC will call for PCB progress reports by SEDF in order to assess the core areas of \nPCB risk management in terms of (i) management structure and organization, (ii) SME credit \n                                                 \n35 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2002. Code of Corporate Governance for Banks and Financial Institutions. Colombo. \n36 In response to recommendations of the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force to combat money laundering \nand terrorist financing, Sri Lanka has enacted three acts, namely the (i) Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist \nFinancing Act No. 25 of 2005, (ii) Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006, and (iii) Financial Transaction \nReporting Act (FTRA) No. 6 of 2006. The FTRA has institutionalized the CBSL\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and \nmade it mandatory for all financial institutions and professionals to adhere to guidelines and stipulations on reporting \nsuspected transactions seeming to suggest money laundering activities. Financial institutions are required to report to \nthe FIU cash transactions and electronic fund transfers above SLRs500,000 and any suspicious transactions.     \n37 Required  improvements  in  risk  management  by  PCB  include  (i)  CB:  streamlining  and  automation  of  the  risk \nmanagement  function  in  view  of  the  growing  portfolio  diversification;  (ii)  DFCC:  creation  of  a  centralized  risk \nmanagement function, initially focusing on credit and progressively on operational and market risk management; (iii) \nNDB: rationalization of the risk management function and increased automation of the credit process; and (iv) SB: \nfurther streamlining of the risk management function, focusing on credit and operational risk management processes. \n38 IFC\u2019S SEDF has concluded memoranda of understanding with CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB. SEDF has been undertaking \ncomprehensive capacity building activities for all the PCBs, as well as for SME borrowers.  ", "   13    \npolicies, (iii) SME credit approval processes, (iv) SME portfolio monitoring mechanisms, (v) SME \nbad debts management, and (vi) SME risk modeling. To track improvements in the PCBs\u2019 risk \nmanagement, a midterm evaluation (18 months after effectiveness of the Project) and a final \nevaluation at the end of the Project will be conducted. Unsatisfactory progress by a PCB can lead \nto cancellation of its access to the SMERDP credit facility. \n  \n  d.   Complementary Component 3: Fostering Regional SME Bankability  \n48.  Access to Investments. The SMERDP fosters regional SME bankability by lending to \nSME value chain clusters which, in turn, promote equity investments through (i) lead firms in the \nformation of SME value chain clusters; and (ii) local venture capital companies (such as Lanka \nVenture Capital), facilitating such companies also to link up with lead firms. Local venture capital \ncompanies have a greater incentive to participate since the presence of a lead firm in the cluster \nwill ensure adequate equity capital and support for the venture. Letters of intent received from Sri \nLankan  private  equity  firms  for  specific  subprojects  confirm  their  interest  as  possible  equity \ninvestors in potential SMERDP subprojects. \n \n49.  An indicative pipeline of possible bankable equity investments in SME value chain clusters \nin the illustrative sectors (footnote 33) has been outlined in Supplementary Appendix C.    \n \n3.  Project Investment Plan and Financing Plan \n50.  Cost Estimates. The total project investment cost (Table 1) is estimated at $88.89 million \nequivalent. The SMERDP funding will not exceed 56.25% of subproject costs. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.  Base Cost    \n  1.  ADB Project Loan  50.00 \n  2.

Financing Plan. The Government has requested a loan of SDR 32,226,000 ($50.0 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nIt will include such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. The financing charges are not to be capitalized. The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk.   \n \n53.  Relending (Government through CBSL to PCBs). The Government will be the borrower. \nThe ADB loan will be provided in foreign exchange and relent by the Government to PCBs in local \ncurrency. The Government will make the ADB loan available through CBSL to the PCBs at the \naverage weighted deposit rate (AWDR)39 under a subsidiary loan agreement. The Government has \nrequested that the loan term (Government to PCBs) not exceed 20 years. \n \n54.  The SMERDP proceeds will be allocated to the PCBs in the following indicative amounts \n(dollar equivalents): (i) CB, $15.0 million; (ii) DFCC, $15.0 million; (iii) NDB, $10 million; and (iv) \nSB, $10 million. The PCB loans are to be disbursed over a 3-year period, subject to a midterm \nreview after 18 months40 to review disbursement progress and refine the arrangements as needed. \nAt the end of 3 years, another progress review will be undertaken. Reallocation of funds can occur \nif any eligible PCB is not in compliance with (i) all applicable prudential regulations and guidelines \nof the CBSL, and (ii) maintenance of at least investment grade as rated by a credit rating agency \nacceptable to ADB. Reallocation of funds, if it leads to an increase in the approved amount of loan \nto any PCB or the addition of any new eligible PCB, will be subject to prior agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB, and consequent changes to the subsidiary loan agreements with the PCBs. \n \n55.  Onlending (PCBs to Regional SMEs and/or SME Value Chain Clusters). The maximum \nsubloan size will be SLRs20 million, of which PCBs will be able to lend up to 75% from the ADB \nloan proceeds. The minimum tenor of a subloan will be 4 years. Onlending from PCBs to eligible \nsubprojects  will  be  at  interest  rates  that  reflect  their  cost  of  funds41 plus  a  spread  to  cover \ntransaction costs and risks. Subloans will be on commercial and competitive terms based on the \nPCB\u2019s  selection  process.  Subloans  will  only  include  activities  not  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  Subproject \nExclusion List (Supplementary Appendix F) and will be subject to post-lending monitoring and \nreview by ADB. Appendix 7 provides a funds flow illustration for the Project.  \n                                                 \n39 Average weighted deposit rate is defined as the weighted average of the interest rates on all outstanding interest \nbearing deposits of commercial banks calculated and published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on its website, \nwww.cbsl.gov.lk. \n40 There will also be annual reviews to assess disbursement progress.  \n41 This currently represents the average weighted deposit rate. ", "   15    \n4.  Procurement \n56.  Procurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) as they relate to financial intermediary loans. \nSubborrowers will be required to undertake procurement in accordance with established private \nsector or commercial practices that are acceptable to ADB.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n57.  The PSC will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting supporting \ndocuments, preparing withdrawal applications, and sending the latter to ADB in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate the timely \nrelease of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Government will, immediately \nafter the loan becomes effective, open and maintain a project imprest account with CBSL for the \nProject that is to be managed by the PSC. The initial advance to the imprest account will be 6 \nmonths\u2019 worth of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To \nfacilitate implementation, a second-generation imprest account will be set up in each PCB to draw \nits equitable share from the first-generation imprest account. ADB's statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum individual \npayment  permitted  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  is  $200,000  equivalent. \nAppendix 10 provides the financial management assessment report.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n58.  The Government\u2019s equitable regional development priority allows ADB the opportunity to \nsupport a high-priority inclusive development intervention. The request for ADB support recognizes \nits involvement with the financial sector, SMEs, microfinance, and private sector development.  \n \n59.  Regional Development. The SMERDP provides critical support for minimizing the regional \ndivide by systematically providing business and employment opportunities for populations outside \nthe western province to participate in, and benefit from, economic growth. Broader sharing of the \nbenefits  of  growth  will  reinforce  the  sustainability  of  the  development  process.  This  is  also \nconsistent with the Government's and ADB\u2019s strategies for supporting growth outside the western \nprovince.  \n \n60.  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Role.  Private  sector-led  SME  development  for  economic \ngrowth  and  employment  through  the  SMERDP  includes  piloting  successful  practices  in  the \ndevelopment of SME value chain clusters in Sri Lanka through commercially viable supporting \npartnerships between credible private lead companies and a cluster of SMEs. Among other things, \nthis will mainstream skills and technology required for enhancing productivity and competitiveness. \nIt  also  fosters  bankable  SMEs  and  encourages  the  lead  firms  to  contribute  equity  to  SMEs. \nIdentified sectors aligned with underdeveloped resource endowments, such as those related to \nvalue addition to agriculture produce, are expected to have significant impact. The efforts of \ndevelopment partners (paras. 33\u201334) in mapping SME value chain clusters will be leveraged \nthrough the SMERDP credit facility.  \n \n61.  Governance. The SMERDP seeks to accelerate and deepen good governance in the \nPCBs in accordance with CBSL corporate governance standards and Sri Lanka\u2019s international \nobligations by (i) using CBSL for linking corporate governance with disbursements to PCBs, (ii) \nincorporating anti-money laundering risk management requirements, (iii) reporting on corporate \ngovernance  structures  and  activities  in  PCB  annual  reports,  and  (iv)  applying  SME  lending \n ", "1 6 \nmonitoring systems. The SMERDP also seeks to accelerate and enhance financial management \ncontrols  through  (i)  the  CBSL  imprest  account;  (ii)  funds  flow  controls,  including  vetting  and \napproval procedures; and (iii) audit and accounting requirements. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  SMERDP Management \n62.  Executing Agency/Implementing Agency. The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) \nis the Executing Agency (EA), and each eligible PCB will be an implementing agency (IA). Each \neligible  PCB  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  its  relevant  operational \ndepartment.  Appendix  8  provides  an  SMERDP  organization  chart  showing  implementation \narrangements.  \n \n63.  Project Steering Committee (PSC). Within one month of loan effectiveness, MOFP will \nestablish a PSC to oversee SMERDP implementation. The PSC will comprise six members that will \ninclude representatives of the MOFP, CBSL, and four PCBs. The PSC will be chaired by the \nSecretary of MOFP or, in his absence, Deputy Secretary, Treasury. The PSC chairperson will liaise \nwith ADB. The PSC may, from time to time, co-opt representatives from other relevant agencies. \nThe committee will meet as needed, but at least once every 2 months. ADB may attend the PSC \nmeetings as determined necessary. The PSC will regularly monitor (i) PCBs\u2019 continued eligibility \nbased on eligibility criteria, corporate governance, and anti-money laundering requirements; and \n(ii) eligible disbursements against estimated PCB targets to regional SMEs and SME value chain \nclusters at market interest rates consistent with ADB\u2019s financial intermediary loan policy.42 The \nPSC will also be responsible for fostering dialogue with the PCBs on implementation progress for \ncomplementary components 2 and 3.  \n \n64.  CBSL will provide a secretariat to the PSC for coordinating the inputs of all PIUs, including \nbenefit  and  impact  monitoring  reports  for  consideration  by  the  PSC.  The  PCB  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  with  relevant  PCB  departments,  ensuring  that  information  and \nreporting requirements related to PCBs and subloans are met, and making sure all necessary \naccounts,  related  financial  statements,  and  disbursement  records  are  duly  submitted  through \nCBSL to the PSC. Appendix 10, Section F provides details of staffing arrangements for the PIUs \nand PSC secretariat. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n65.  The SMERDP will be implemented over 3 years. The schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Anticorruption   \n66.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  EA,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the SMERDP. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with SMERDP \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof the EA, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. During review missions, the \n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section D6/BP: Bank Policies. Manila (15 December). ", "   17    \nfinancial management, governance, and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure \nthat their provisions remain valid and are helping to realize the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \n67.  The Project supports good governance in PCBs by ensuring CBSL monitoring of PCB \ngovernance,  including  transparency  and  disclosure  requirements.  In  addition,  market-based \npricing, autonomy to PCBs in selecting subprojects, and regular monitoring by PSC reduce the \nvulnerability  to  corruption.  A  summary  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessment  is  in \nAppendix 11, and a detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n4.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n68.  The  PCBs  will  have  their  accounts  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income \nstatement, and statement of sources and applications of funds) audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The PCBs will submit their audited accounts and financial statements, through \nCBSL, to the EA and ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition, PCBs \nwill submit semiannual unaudited accounts to CBSL. \n \n69.  Through  CBSL,  the  EA  will  (i)  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify goods and services financed from the Project\u2019s proceeds, (ii) ensure separate accounts for \neach loan to the IAs, (iii) ensure accounts and related financial statements are audited annually in \naccordance with appropriate auditing standards consistently applied by auditors acceptable to \nADB, and (iv) submit to ADB certified audited accounts and financial statements within 9 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year.   \n \n70.  The Project\u2019s monitoring reports prepared by the PSC secretariat based on inputs from \nPCBs will be provided quarterly to the PSC, EA, and ADB. The reports will contain (i) description of \nprogress made during the period; (ii) changes to the implementation schedule, if any; (iii) problems \nand difficulties encountered and the remedial actions taken; (iv) the social, environmental, and \neconomic impacts; (v) the work to be carried out in the next period; and (vi) a summary financial \naccount for the SMERDP with expenditures to date. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s completion, \nthe EA, through the PCBs, will furnish to ADB a project completion report containing a detailed \nevaluation of project design, costs, PCB performance, social and economic impacts, and other \ndetails as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n5.  Project Performance and Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation  \n71.  The CBSL and PCBs, will need to maintain a systematic project performance management \nsystem (PPMS), satisfactory to ADB, that will be included in the PCBs\u2019 management information \nsystem. The key performance indicators and assumptions in the design and monitoring framework \nwill be the basis for the PPMS. Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the CBSL and PCBs will \nhave established the baseline for each of these indicators and such information will be made \navailable to review missions and to the Government for future impact assessment surveys. The \nscope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of collection will be guided by the \nneed for feedback on implementation. \n \n6.  Project Review \n72.  To  ensure  responsive  and  timely  implementation,  there  will  be  review  missions  in \naccordance with the SMERDP implementation schedule set forth in Appendix 8. There will be \nregular interaction among the EA, CBSL, PIUs, and ADB. Annual performance review will be \nconducted by the Government, CBSL, ADB, and the PCBs based on an annual progress report to \n ", "1 8 \nbe prepared by each PCB. In addition, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken by the \nGovernment, CBSL, PCBs, and ADB approximately 18 months after the Project\u2019s effectiveness \nthat  will  (i)  evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess \nimplementation performance against project indicators; (iii) review and establish compliance with \nloan covenants; (iv) identify problems and constraints and, if necessary, recommend changes in \nthe design or implementation arrangements.    \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n73.  The PCBs, SMEs and SME value chain clusters are private sector entities. The benefits of \npursuing a private sector-led regional SME development could be significant. More broadly, an \nemphasis on market-based interest rates for SME credit introduces a sustainable development \nparadigm  in  contrast  to  dependence  on  government-sponsored,  subsidized  programs.  In  this \ncontext, successful SMERDP implementation will develop support for sustaining private sector-\ndriven policies for economic growth.  \n \n74.  Regional Development. Recognizing that high incidence of poverty and lack of gainful \nemployment opportunities fuel discontent and unrest, the Project\u2019s regional development impact \ncontributes to stability in Sri Lanka\u2019s less developed provinces. Designed to promote regional \nSMEs, the Project will benefit SMEs and SME value chain clusters by improving access to credit. \nSubloans are estimated to generate employment for approximately 50,000 people from mid-2008 \nto mid-2011, as well as annual output equal to 2.0% of the 2005 SME sector output. Employment \nwill  help  reduce  the  relatively  high  incidence  of  poverty  outside  the  western  province.  The \nSMERDP also supports the poverty reduction goal through greater access to skills and technology \nfor SME development, which, in turn, will facilitate better utilization and value addition of such \nproductive resources as labor, farm inputs, and infrastructure. The Project\u2019s poverty impact is \ndiscussed in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 9.  \n \n75.  Institutional. The SMERDP will enhance the regional outreach of PCBs and the capability \nof  PCBs\u2019  SME  credit  staff  in  terms  of  (i)  project  appraisal,  supervision,  credit  and  portfolio \nadministration; (ii) opportunities to apply relevant risk management and credit scoring techniques; \nand (iii) improved operational governance of PCBs through transaction-based accountability for \ncorporate governance and anti-money laundering. Mainstreaming best practices in SME financing \nwill also improve portfolio quality over time, which will prompt other banks to increase their regional \nSME portfolios. Moreover, gradual broadening and deepening of SME portfolios not only provides \na base of recurring earning assets but also enables the PCBs to tap into the savings potential \noutside the western province.  \n \nB.  Risks \n76.  Achieving expected impacts will depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees of risks. Mitigation measures are being put in place wherever feasible. Major risks are \nseen to be the following: \n(i)  Security. Escalation of conflict could pose risks for regional SMEs should areas \noutside the current conflict zone become involved. While the PCBs stand ready to \nlend to SMEs in the conflict-affected areas, such lending would be undertaken as \nthe security situation permits and the PCBs perceive the risks as acceptable. \n(ii)  SME  viability.  The  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  in  some  locations  could  affect \nutilization of the SMERDP facility. ADB\u2019s assessment indicates that PCBs have \nsignificant opportunities for lending to viable regional SMEs. This risk is further ", "   19    \nmitigated through access to BDS and the introduction of lead firms in SME value \nchain clusters that will inject equity, know-how, and marketing into SMEs.  \n(iii)  Delinquency. Delinquency risks that PCBs face in expanding their regional SME \nportfolios are mitigated through (a) improved access to credit information, (b) better \nuse of collaterals, (c) strengthened governance structures and risk management \npractices, (d) risk-based pricing, and (e) CBSL monitoring.  \n(iv)  Implementation. While the demand for SME credit is robust, there could still be \nimplementation delays in case the eligible PCBs would refocus their priorities and/or \nfail to sustain expected performance standards. These risks have been dealt with by \nassessing PCB eligibility and commitment up front. In addition, the Project enables \nsubstitution of PCBs in case of performance shortcomings.  \n(v)  Complementary support. The risk of complementary support not progressing as \nenvisaged  is  not  considered  significant.  The  Government  fully  realizes  that \nmacroeconomic stability requires structural and sector-level reforms. In particular, \nthe Government has reemphasized financial and fiscal reforms.  \n(vi)  Private sector perception. Private investors\u2019 perceptions are critical for the flow of \ninvestment  in  regional  SMEs.  Measures  under  the  Project  to  sustain  investor \nconfidence include PCBs\u2019 commitments upfront to provide credit to viable regional \nSMEs and SME value chain clusters. For its part, the Government has given priority \nto  reducing  regional  inequalities  by  facilitating  regional  public  infrastructure \ndevelopment and promoting value addition in products manufactured or processed \nby SMEs. The enabling environment for SMEs is also being enhanced. \n \n77.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies. The SMERDP is classified as Category FI \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). An environmental management system \nframework  endorsed  by  the  Government  on  behalf  of  the  PCBs  is  attached  as  Appendix  5.  \nSMERDP will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). SMERDP will also not \nhave any impacts on indigenous peoples/ethnic minorities and will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  An  annual  environmental  compliance  monitoring  report  will  be \nsubmitted by the PCBs to ADB through the PSC. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n78.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)   In the event of default by a PCB and its failure to remedy within 6 months, MOFP, \nthrough CBSL, will ensure a new PCB is selected in accordance with the same \nselection criteria as for the four initial PCBs as agreed between the Government and \nADB. The selection of a new PCB will be subject to prior joint approval by MOFP \nand ADB; \n(ii)   MOFP will ensure not to onlend any funds to a PCB, unless such PCB has recruited \nthe necessary safeguard implementation staff and that such positions will remain \nfilled throughout the duration of the Project; \n(iii)   Within one month of loan effectiveness, each PCB will have established or updated \nits  Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)  in  accordance  with  the  EMS \nframework  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Each  PCB  will \nimplement the Project in full compliance with such EMS, as may be amended from \ntime to time, in line with the EMS framework; \n ", "2 0 \n(iv)  The Government shall ensure that a satisfactory financial management system is \nmaintained throughout the duration of SMERDP; \n(v)   Annual Project reports will include at least the following information (a) emerging \nsector policy issues; (b) performance of all PCBs; (c) subproject performance; (d) \nsubborrowers  repayment  performance;  (e)  subprojects'  contributions  towards \nachieving project objectives; (f) lessons learned; and (g) benefit monitoring in terms \nof output and employment; \n(vi)   Each PCB will ensure to advise the PSC (and the PSC shall immediately advise \nADB) in advance of any major decision on events such as mergers and acquisitions, \nchanges in key management officers, and any charter changes that may have a \nsignificant adverse impact on its organization, management, policies, procedures \nand  operations.  In  such  event,  MOFP  and  ADB  jointly  reserves  the  right  for \nreallocation of credit across PCBs and for lending to new eligible PCBs; \n(vii)   Throughout Project implementation, the PCBs must be in compliance with (i) all \napplicable prudential regulations and guidelines of the CBSL, and (ii) maintenance \nof at least investment grade as rated by a credit rating agency acceptable to ADB. \nCompliance with CBSL prudential regulations and guidelines will be certified by an \nacceptable auditor to ADB while the applicable credit rating will be based on the \nsubmission of the actual credit rating report to CBSL.  \n(viii)  The Government shall through the PSC monitor the PCBs\u2019 progress reports under \nthe International Finance Corporation funded South Asia Enterprise Development \nFacility. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n79.

Overview. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for about 80\u201390% of the total \nnumber of enterprises in Sri Lanka and 75% of employment in the private sector. Nevertheless, \nSMEs are not realizing their full potential for contributing to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth and \nemployment.  Strong  SME  growth  could  therefore  underpin  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  drive  to  achieve \nprosperity, alleviate conflict, increase employment, and lessen the fiscal burden.  \n \nA.  Major Constraints Facing SMEs \n \n2.  Although successive governments in Sri Lanka since 1948 have introduced various \nsupport programs to facilitate SMEs\u2019 growth and expansion, many SMEs still face significant \nconstraints in doing business. As revealed in an investment climate survey, firms emphasize \nfinancing and infrastructure constraints as two major impediments in their development.1 Rural \nfirms also face major constraints in gaining access to markets.  \n \n3.  Financing. Only 14% of working capital for small firms in Sri Lanka is financed by bank \nloans, and that figure is about 30% for medium-sized firms. Bank finance is even more limited \nfor new investment. Only about 11% of new investment at small firms in Sri Lanka is financed \nthrough bank loans. Private commercial or specialized banks play a particularly limited role for \nrural firms, with less than 12% of them applying to these institutions for credit. \n \n4.  Infrastructure. The prolonged civil conflict in Sri Lanka since 1983 has discouraged \ninvestment and diverted resources from productive uses. Low investment in infrastructure has \nundermined firms\u2019 productivity and economic growth. The lack of roads and unstable electricity \nsupply are key obstacles to existing businesses and start-up enterprises. To cope with outages, \nnearly 75% of urban manufacturing firms own generators. For these firms, a generator costs the \nequivalent of 12% of their fixed assets, on average, and absorbs resources that could otherwise \nbe invested productively in their core business. In addition to the bottlenecks in large-scale \ninfrastructure,  SMEs  are  often  constrained  by  a  lack  of  such  supporting  infrastructure  as \ncommon markets, small connection roads, landing piers, and waste disposal facilities.    \n \n5.  Markets. More than 27% of nonfarm rural business owners cite low market demand as a \nkey constraint (footnote 1). This constraint stems from a range of factors. Rural entrepreneurs \nhave few contacts or links with larger firms or buyers that could increase their exposure to \nbigger and more diverse markets. The goods they produce are often of low quality and have \nlimited appeal in larger markets. Poor transport and telecommunications restrict their access to \ninformation. The vast majority of firms sell their goods locally and only about 10% of rural \nnonfarm enterprises sell their output to a large domestic or international firm.  \n \n6.  The lack of finance, infrastructure, and markets reinforce one another and exacerbate \nthe difficulties SMEs face in doing business.    \n \nB.  Increasing Regional Disparity \n \n7.  The constraints are felt more strongly by SMEs outside the western province, and this \ncontributes to mounting regional disparity. The economic weight and growth in Sri Lanka is \n                                                 \n1  World Bank and ADB. 2004. Sri Lanka Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate Survey. Colombo. ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nheavily biased in favor of the western province,2 where the capital and main port are located. \nThe western province\u2019s share of national gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 45% in \n1998 to 50% in 2003. The per capita gross regional domestic product of the western province \nwas about $1,467, while that of the northwestern province was next, at $697. Gross regional \ndomestic product in 2003 was lowest, at just $397, for the northern province. The incidence of \npoverty is also much higher outside the western province. The share of households living below \nthe poverty line3 was 9.2% in the western province in 2002 but more than double this (19.2%) in \nall other provinces.    \n \n8.  The western province, with its higher concentration of economic activity, receives net \npositive financial transfers from the rest of the country. Based on information gathered from \nforeign banks and the five largest domestic commercial banks that hold 90% of commercial \nbank assets, the ratio of net credit to deposits for the western province is 110% compared to the \nnational average of 83%. This net transfer of savings from poorer to more developed regions \nexacerbates regional disparities.   \n \n9.  As better economic conditions and opportunities attract more businesses to the western \nprovince, the concentration of wealth and development is bound to intensify. Large regional \ndisparities create potential for dissatisfaction, disunity, and conflict. Therefore, reducing regional \ndisparity is of enormous economic and political significance for Sri Lanka.  \n \nC.  Fostering Linkages: SME Value Chain Clusters to Address Constraints   \n \n1.   Potential Benefits of Improving Supply Chain and SME Value Chain   \n    Clustering \n \n10.  The Government recognizes that constraints faced by regional firms are associated with \nregional disparity in Sri Lanka. Past measures, however, have focused on the state\u2019s trying to \nsubstitute for the role of markets. In finance, for example, the Government directed lending \nthrough state-owned financial institutions, and it subsidized or controlled interest rates.  \n \n11.  The SME value chain cluster concept has proven useful in addressing SME financing \nand other constraints, especially in agriculture-related sectors. The concept encourages firms of \ndifferent sizes and at different levels in a value chain to develop mutually beneficial commercial \nrelationships. Typically, an SME value chain cluster involves large lead firms engaging SMEs as \nsuppliers and subcontractors of products and services. Large firms benefit by gaining reliable \ninputs and supply chain integration while SMEs are able to overcome bottlenecks in marketing, \nlogistics, technology, product development, quality assurance, and standards. Involving large \nfirms also helps to address the information opaqueness of SMEs that limits their access to bank \nfinancing. More importantly, clustering can help SMEs to improve the competitiveness of their \nproducts and services so as to boost their financial performance. An SME that consistently \nproves it can pass the test of markets will overcome initial financing difficulties. The benefits of \nclustering  stem  from  economies  of  scale,  increased  information,  and  technology  spillovers \namong firms. \n \n12.  While SME value chain clusters warrant support from governments and development \nagencies for their initialization, direct credit allocation from, or directed lending by, governments \n                                                 \n2  The western province comprises the Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts. \n3 The poverty line is calculated as SLRs1,423 per month, based on the cost of basic needs methodology. Data is not \navailable for the northern and eastern provinces. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nis not appropriate. Lending should be carried out by financial intermediaries having sound \nproject evaluation, risk management, and market discipline. Thus, the development of clustering \nshould be driven by private sector firms in pursuit of mutually beneficial outcomes. Resources \nfor cluster development, including finance, should come from private sector participants. \n \n2.  Need and Potential for Cluster Development in Illustrative Sectors \n \n13.  A number of sectors were studied carefully at the project preparatory stage to examine \ntheir potential for clustering. These include leather products, fisheries, dairy, spices, coconut \ncoir, fruits and vegetables, and packaging.4 Performance in these sectors has been relatively \nunsatisfactory  due  to  low  quality  of  output  and  fragmented  supply  chains  that  result  in \nconsiderable waste in production and distribution. These sectors have (i) potential for improved \nquality and output by geographically dispersed SMEs; (ii) rich factor endowment in Sri Lanka \nand  potential  for  exports;  and  (iii)  corresponding  opportunities  for  credit  backed  equity \ninvestment from larger corporations with good track records in growth and exports, along with \nexperience in developing value chains through SME clusters.  \n \n14.  Fisheries Sector. Wastage is estimated at 30\u201340% due to inadequate cold storage and \npreservation. Fishing clusters can be formed by enhancing the linkage between fishing societies, \nprocessing companies, and markets. This will improve collection logistics, reduce fuel usage, \nimprove  fish  quality,  and  facilitate  faster  collection  and  quicker  disposal.  There  are  large \ncorporations  that  have  indicated  interest  in  strengthening  the  supply  chain  by  engaging \nfishermen as suppliers.  \n \n15.  Dairy Sector. Farms are small and productivity per animal is low because of poor quality \nbreeding and feeds. The relatively long time between milk collection and milk processing leads \nto milk having a heightened bacteria count and excessive spoilage. The costs of bringing milk \nfrom the farm to the factory are very high, as is taking the products from the factory to the \nmarket. An enhanced supply chain can bring down collection and distribution costs, which could, \nin turn, bring down costs and retail prices. That would boost sales volumes and margins for \nprocessors and farmers. An SME value chain cluster can be made up of dairy processing \ncompanies and dairy farmers, with enhanced linkages between the farmers and processors. It \nalso could involve improving dairy farmers\u2019 access to extension services. Such support facilities \nas, for example, cooling equipment can also be established to reduce waste.   \n \n16.  Fruit and Vegetable Sector. Sri Lanka possesses good growing potential due to the \ncountry\u2019s climate and fertile soil. The sector is composed of a large number of small growers \nwho  are  price-takers,  however,  and  margins  are  largely  determined  by  middlemen  and \ncollectors. Contract farming accounts for only a small fraction of production. Post-harvest losses \nare estimated at 30\u201340%. Exports of perishable fruits and vegetables are still limited, as the \nsector lacks the ability to provide a stable supply with consistent quality to overseas buyers. The \ndevelopment of some clustering by leading exporters engaging in contract farming has yielded \npositive results. Under these contracts, the farmer (or farmer group) is obliged to grow a certain \nvolume and quality for a specified off-taker (trade house or supermarket chain). Small farmers \nhave  benefited  from  increased  pre-  and  post-harvest  information  and  services;  improved \nproduction quality; and better access to packing, storage, and distribution channels. Meanwhile, \nleading exporters have benefited from increased supply and quality. Contract farming has also \nimproved  farmers\u2019  access  to  finance,  as  it  helps  in  providing  financial  institutions  with \ninformation about the creditworthiness of farmers.   \n                                                 \n4  It is important to bear in mind that these are illustrative sectors and do not constitute an inclusive list. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n \n17.  Coconut Coir Sector. Although Sri Lanka is the leading exporter of coir fiber and pith, \nmore than half of these products are exported as low-value commodities. In contrast, 95% of \nIndia\u2019s coir-based products are value-added outputs. A key obstacle facing Sri Lanka\u2019s coir \nindustry is the low level of its technology and absence of an effective quality control system. \nPoor and variable husk quality (relating to high dust content, short fibers, husk residues, and \nmoisture in the fiber) limits export potential. The industry\u2019s future success lies in improved \nproduct quality and consistency. Consequently, export opportunities will be critically dependent \nupon value chain development to facilitate supply chain efficiencies. A cluster of spinning and \nweaving SMEs could be developed around larger producers and exporters, which could in turn \nact as a resource and information center for the cluster. Development of the industry will \nparticularly benefit poorer areas, where there is an urgent need to create employment and \ngenerate income.   \n \n18.  Spices Sector. Cinnamon and pepper are the two leading exports in the sector. As \nelsewhere in agriculture, however, the spices sector is negatively affected by uneven quality \nand much post-harvest loss. For example, spice collectors use the same bag to hold all grades \nof the particular spice purchased, which leads to mixed product quality and additional costs from \nsorting. There are also many layers of collectors and dealers in the supply chain, which adds to \nthe cost of distribution. The priorities for the spice sector are to establish effective collecting and \nprocessing cooperatives and supply chain institutions for the small producers that are similar to \nthose already established in the tea industry.   \n \n19.  Leather Sector. The sector can be developed by using a cluster approach where much \nof the manufacturing tasks can be subcontracted out and the final assembly and marketing can \nbe done by large-scale manufacturers. In this arrangement, the large companies are able to \naccept and fill bigger orders and the SMEs are assured of work and upgrading their skills and \nequipment. Cluster development can take advantage of this market opportunity by improving \ntime and quality management, as well as by facilitating the diffusion of skills and technology to \nsmall subcontractors.     \n \nD.  Economic and Poverty Reduction Benefits from Clustering Development  \n \n20.  Overall, there is a strong potential for developing clusters to strengthen many sectors\u2019 \nsupply chains. This can benefit large as well as smaller firms. In particular, it helps SMEs to gain \ninformation, technology, market access, and creditworthiness. It also helps SMEs to overcome \nsome size limitations. For example, Sri Lankan entrepreneurs operating in export markets often \nface difficulties in meeting the minimum order sizes placed by importers in other countries. Fruit \nand vegetable exporters, for example, are often unable to fill even one container with produce of \nconsistent quality  while  a  single order  may  be  for  several  containers.  Utilizing  the  market \ncapacity of large firms clearly benefits smaller players.  \n \n21.  The investment in developing SME clusters through the $50 million ADB loan can have \ndirect impact on the regional economies. The $50 million loan will be accompanied by about \n$16.67  million  in  the  private  commercial  or  specialized  banks\u2019  (PCBs\u2019)  own  increased \ninvestment into regional SMEs and SME value chain clusters. Injecting $66.67 million into the \nregional economies will first increase credit and investment in the underdeveloped provinces. \nThe initial investment will initiate a series of expanding effects, conventionally known as the \n\u201cmultiplier process.\u201d This is because, given initial investment, additional income is created that is \nagain partly spent on consumption goods and so on. As a result, national income increases by \nmore than the initial investment expenditure. The magnitude of the investment multiple varies, \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nbut it is estimated to be around 2.5 times.5 Assuming that the investment is rolled over every \nfour years, this could induce an increase in output outside the western province of about $170 \nmillion from 2008 to 2011.  \n \n22.  Benefits will arise from greater direct investment. More importantly, increased linkages \nbetween firms will facilitate efficiency improvements. Given that investment is located outside \nthe western province, it represents a step towards encouraging private investment where it is \nneeded most. Contributing to the prevalence of poverty outside the western province is the fact \nthat  agricultural  productivity  grew  little  over  the  past  decade,  even  as  agricultural  prices \nstagnated. As a result, rural and agricultural households suffered a decline in real incomes. The \ndevelopment of industries through SME clustering outside the western province can help to lift \nhousehold income.     \n \nE.   Overall SME Credit Demand Analysis \n \n23.   Demand and supply of SME credit is determined by a complex set of factors. However, \nSME financing issues can be largely overcome (and, as a result, the supply-demand gap for \nSME credit can be minimized) if two fundamental factors are addressed: (i) improving the \ncapacity and incentives to provide SME finance from the bank level, and (ii) fostering bankable \nprojects at the firm level. The Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project can \nact as a catalyst in addressing SME financing issues from both the bank and firm level by: (i) \nstrengthening PCBs\u2019 risk management as well as providing PCBs with access to medium- to \nlong term funds thereby encouraging PCBs to proactively seek financing opportunities among \nregional SMEs, and (ii) financing SME value chain clusters to overcome market imperfections \nsuch as coordination failures through forging stronger linkages between large firms and SMEs, \nthereby nurturing the supply of bankable projects at the firm level.  \n  \nF.  Growth Impediments and Interventions in the SME Sector \n \n24.

The Financial Sector \n1.  The past two decades witnessed significant financial reforms in Sri Lanka. Reforms \nconsisted of interest rate deregulation, restructuring of state-owned banks, allowing entry of \nprivate sector financial institutions, easing restrictions on foreign financial institutions, reduction \nof directed lending, and a shift in focus of banking sector supervision from micro-intervention to \nprudential regulations. As a result of reforms, the Sri Lankan financial sector has become a \ndiversified sector that includes most of the institutional elements of a modern financial system.  \n \n2.  In Sri Lanka, the commercial banks dominate in terms of assets, but a wide range of \nother  institutions  also  offer  financial  services.  In  addition  to  the  financial  intermediaries,  a \ndomestic capital market has developed over the years. There are 22 commercial banks, 42 \ndepository institutions (a national savings bank, 24 finance companies, and 17 regional rural \ndevelopment  banks),  3  state-sponsored  long-term  financial  institutions,  13  insurance \ncompanies, and 2 public pension funds. The equity market has remained fairly small (with a \nmarket capitalization of about 25% of GDP), despite a relatively long period of existence. Some \n241 companies are listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, representing 20 business sectors. \nGovernment debt securities dominate Sri Lanka\u2019s debt market, representing 98% of the total \nvalue of issued debentures. Until recently, there has been no market-based yield curve because \nprimary government issues were sold at below-market rates to state-owned institutions. To \nprevent losses, almost all investors hold bonds to maturity. The maximum maturity of most \nsovereign bonds is 5\u20137 years. Since 1997, certain corporate bonds have also been listed on the \nStock Exchange, but such instruments are relatively illiquid. There is also a wide range of \nnonbank financial institutions that complement the role of the commercial banks. The major \nnonbank  financial  institutions  include  insurance  companies,  contractual  savings  institutions, \nfactoring  companies,  leasing  companies,  venture  capital  and  private  equity  firms,  and \nmicrofinance providers.  \n \n3.  Overall, the banking sector dominates the financial sector, with total assets of commercial \nbanks accounting for about 70% of all financial sector assets. This discussion is thus focused on \nthe banking sector. The institutional structure of the banking market reflects the long history of \nestablishing special-purpose institutions or providing specific legal powers to meet identified \neconomic needs. The three state-owned institutions, namely, People\u2019s Bank, Bank of Ceylon \n(BOC), and National Savings Bank (NSB), have the largest branch networks and numbers of \ndeposit accounts. There are 11 licensed commercial banks having broad business activities, \nand  these  generally  have  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  engaged  in  all  areas  of  the  financial \nservices. There has been some consolidation in the sector, with four foreign banks exiting the \nmarket over the past few years while several of the smaller domestic banks were restructured.  \n \n4.  The two state-owned commercial banks, the BOC and People\u2019s Bank, are incorporated \nunder their own statutes rather than the banking law. This reflects their mandates to meet the \npolicy objectives of providing financial services throughout the country and to target government \npriority sectors rather than the pursuit of purely commercial objectives. While the two banks still \naccount for over 40% of commercial banking assets, their market share has declined in recent \nyears. Loans to government and state-owned enterprises now constitutes some 20\u201330% of the \ntotal loan portfolio in the two banks, whereas that figure was some 60% about a decade ago.       \n \n5.  The policy of the current government is not to proceed with the previously planned \nprivatization of People\u2019s Bank (or of any other state-owned enterprise). The current policy ", "  Appendix 3  31 \ndirection of Government is to commercialize the operations of the state-owned banks, including \nPeople\u2019s Bank, rather than privatize. \n \n6.  There  are  four  relatively  large  private  domestic  banks:  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon \nLimited (CB), Hatton National Bank, Sampath Bank Limited (SB), and Seylan Bank. The CB has \nbeen  consistently  the  most  profitable  domestic  bank,  due  in  large  part  to  its  much  lower \nnoninterest expenses and success in migrating customers to electronic transactions. Of the 11 \nforeign banks in Sri Lanka, only Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation  and Standard \nChartered, with 10 and nine branches, respectively, compete in the retail market. Collectively, \nthe foreign-owned banks account for about 18% of commercial bank assets but only about 9% \nof loans, reflecting the much higher liquidity of the foreign banks. These indicators understate \nthe importance of foreign banks, however, as they provide the majority of trade finance activities \n(for example, import letters of credit). Most medium to large businesses in Sri Lanka have a \nrelationship with at least one of the foreign-owned banks, largely because of the need for letters \nof credit from banks with international reputation.         \n \n7.  There are 14 licensed specialized banks. These comprise a diverse set of institutions and \ninclude  savings  banks,  housing  banks,  development  finance  institutions,  and  regional \ndevelopment banks. By far the largest of the licensed specialized banks is NSB, which is the \nsecond-largest  deposit-taking  institution  in  the  country,  ranking  behind  the  BOC.  NSB\u2019s \noperations  are  narrowly  focused,  as  it  mostly  provides  savings  accounts  through  its  large \nnetwork of branches, post offices, and savings shops. NSB invests about 80% of its total assets \nin government debt. This narrow bank function helps to keep operating costs and credit risk low \ncompared  to  those  of  banks  which  must  support  the  costs  of  developing  investment \nopportunities  and  have  much  more  robust  systems  for  credit  risk  management  and  credit \nadministration.   \n \n8.  The licensed specialized banks also include development financing companies. Sri Lanka \nhas two primary development finance companies: the Development Finance Corporation of \nCeylon, now the DFCC Bank (DFCC), and the National Development Bank of Sri Lanka PLC \n(NDB). NDB1 and DFCC were originally government-owned development finance institutions \nthat were privatized in the 1990s, with the Government retaining a minority stake in each \ninstitution.  Both  DFCC  and  NDB  have  evolved  from  state-owned  development  finance \ninstitutions  to  becoming  universal  and  cohesive  financial  services  groups  with  the  right  to \ncompete  with  commercial  banks.  They  depend  primarily  on  funding  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  agencies  to  support  their  development  lending  activities.  Reliance  on  donor \norganizations and a product base of project loans are not sustainable. Each bank endeavors to \nincrease the mobilization of domestic deposits and has acquired a commercial bank license as \na means of broadening its range of product offerings. As a result, both institutions have also \nbecome less concentrated on development-oriented projects and more commercially based. \nNDB and DFCC have been highly profitable and have much lower overhead costs than do the \nother commercial banks. The CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB are engaged in onlending of an ADB \nloan2 to the SME sector. In keeping with the needs of SMEs, DFCC and NDB have been scaling \nup training facilities and creating specialized branches or divisions geared to serving SMEs.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Privatized with ADB support. \n2  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans, Partial \nCredit Guarantee, and Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n9.  There are six regional development finance institutions: Kandurate, Rajaratna, Ruhuma, \nSabaragamuwa, Uva, and Wayamba. These are mainly conduits for government-subsidized \ncredit programs, small business lending, and microlending. They collectively have 194 branches \nand assets of SLRs13.5 billion, or just short of 5% of the assets of all licensed specialized \nbanks. There are also three small private savings and development banks. The regional finance \ninstitutions have been mainly ineffectual because they lack basic lending and other skills. The \nGovernment is contemplating to merge the six regional institutions with the recently established \nLanka Putra Bank so as to better serve the SME sector. However, it remains to be seen \nwhether Lanka Putra Bank can fulfill its mandate to cater to the demands in the areas of \ninfrastructure,  SME  sector,  microfinance  and  development  banking.  Past  experience  from \nspecialized SME banks in Sri Lanka and elsewhere points to their difficulties in delivering \ndesigned outcomes. As such, SME financing cannot be divorced from the mainstream financial \ninstitutions.  \n \nB.  Achievements \n10.  The banking sector in Sri Lanka is sounder and more resilient as a result of reforms \nundertaken over the past two decades. The benefits of reforms are borne out by banking sector \nperformance indicators: the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans has fallen, the \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  has  increased,  and  profitability  has  risen.  Capital  adequacy \nreflects the overall position of bank capital. Adequate capital helps in absorbing financial risks \nand protects depositors from potential losses that a bank might incur. In Sri Lanka, the average \nCAR of state-owned commercial banks increased from 2.9% in 2001 to 5.5% in 2004, and that \nof domestic private banks rose from 10.5% to 11.1%. While the CAR of foreign banks declined \nfrom 14.2% in 2001 to 12.4% in 2004, it is still well in excess of the 9% minimum requirement. \nThe average CAR for licensed commercial banks further improved from 10.3% in 2004 to 12.4% \nin 2005. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPLs declined from 21.8% in 2001 to 12.6% in \n2006 for state-owned banks, from 18.1% to 10.5% for domestic private banks in the period, and \nfrom 12.8% to 3.3% for foreign banks. The quality of banking supervision has improved since \n2002, with all banks now being examined on-site at least once in a 2-year cycle. Together with \nincreased depth in off-site analysis, this has greatly improved the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\u2019s \nability to identify weaknesses in banks. Prudential standards also have been strengthened.       \n \nC.  Remaining Issues \n11.  Recent indicators point to improved bank soundness and performance in Sri Lanka. \nHowever, the reform process remains incomplete. Some segments of the banking sector and \nsome individual banks remain vulnerable. In particular, the performance of state-owned banks \nhas generally been weaker than that of private and foreign banks. Improving the performance of \nstate-owned banks should remain a high priority on the reform agenda. The keys to financial \nsector development in Sri Lanka are to continue the broad thrust of reforms begun in the 1990s \nto strengthen the governance infrastructure and institutional framework, while also decreasing \ndirect government intervention. Sustainable progress is dependent upon further improvements \nin the legal framework for financial services and for commercial transactions more generally, \nbuilding financial market infrastructure, and strengthening and enforcing prudential norms.   \n \n12.  The high cost of credit remains a significant policy concern. The spread between deposit \nand lending rates has widened since improved margins are needed by the weaker banks to \nearn enough to cover their accumulated loan losses and high operating expenses. Until weak \nbanks (both state owned and private sector) are restructured or exit the market, competition will \nbe  limited,  margins  will  remain  high,  and  the  relatively  more  efficient  banks,  even  if ", "  Appendix 3  33 \nuncompetitive by international standards, will be highly profitable. Major potential reform areas \ninvolve (i) completing the financial sector legal reforms, including a securitization bill and anti-\nmoney laundering statute; (ii) reforming the state-owned financial institutions, addressing not \nonly asset quality and capital issues but also modernization so that Sri Lankans will be able to \ntake full advantage of electronic payments, ATMs, and credit and debit cards; (iii) stringently \nenforcing  prudential  standards  for  both  public  and  private  sector  banks  to  avoid  market \ndistortions, higher costs for consumers, and extraordinary profits for well-run banks due to the \nweak  banks\u2019  lack  of  competitiveness;  and  (iv)  addressing  the  infrastructure  weakness  for \nfinancial services. \n  \n \n \n \n \n ", "3\n  Appendix 4  4\nA\nEXTERNAL COORDINATION MATRIX  p\np\ne\n  n\nd\nName of  Type of        ix\n 4\nOrganization  Assistance  Major Activities  Amount  Time Frame   \nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Value Chain Cluster Development \nGTZ  TA  TA to facilitate the establishment of SME value chain clusters in spices,  TA grant of  Mid-2004 to \nrubber, construction, packaging, dye and mold making, and organic farming.  \u20ac1.5 million   mid-2008  \nThe major activities include setting up core groups to facilitate the technology \ntransfer of sector-specific know-how, certifications, branding, marketing, and \nlinkage between firms.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP \nor the Project) seeks to facilitate the development of SMEs outside the western province, with a \nspecific emphasis on moderating regional disparities. The SMERDP consists of a project loan of \nSDR 32,226,000 ($50.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for extending \ncredit through 4 private commercial or specialized banks (PCBs) to regional SMEs and SME \nvalue chain clusters.  \n \n2.  The four private commercial or specialized banks (PCBs) eligible for credit facility under \nthe SMERDP include Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited (CB), DFCC Bank (DFCC), National \nDevelopment Bank Limited of Sri Lanka PLC (NDB), and Sampath Bank Limited (SB). These \nbanks are among the strongest and most mature financial institutions in Sri Lanka and are \nexperienced in implementing credit line projects from donor agencies. CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB \nwere also participating banks for ADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development \nProgram (SMESDP) 1 loan in 2001. Past experience from similar credit lines (e.g., SMESDP) \nindicates that lending to SMEs is unlikely to involve significant adverse environmental impacts. \n \n3.  All the four banks adhere to the rules and regulations of Central Environmental Authority \n(CEA) of Sri Lanka. Their current environmental management systems (EMSs) are now under \nreview. Improving and sustaining EMS implementation will benefit the Project and the banks. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangement of the Project \n4.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project is the Ministry of Finance and Planning \n(MOFP), and the implementation agencies are the four banks participating in the SMERDP. The \nMOFP thus has overall responsibility for ensuring that national environmental policies and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements are adhered to by the four \nparticipating  banks.  MOFP  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  that  will  include \nrepresentatives of the MOFP, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and the PCBs. The committee will \nhave the authority to make decisions essential to ensuring the Project\u2019s progress. As credit \ndelivery institutions, the PCBs commit to updating or establishing and sustaining implementation \nof EMSs. To ensure successful EMS implementation, the PCBs will allocate appropriate staff \nresources and develop appropriate procedures (relevant to the types of subprojects to be \nfunded and nature of their impacts) in order to screen subprojects, conduct due diligence, \nreview environmental assessment reports, monitor and report on implementation, and evaluate \nthe performance of the EMS for continual improvement. An annual environmental compliance \nmonitoring report submitted by the PCBs through the project steering committee to ADB is \nrequired to support ADB\u2019s compliance oversight of the Project.   \n \n5.  The MOFP, through the PSC and PCBs, will ensure that the environmental assessment \nwill be undertaken in a manner including participation of the PCBs\u2019 clients. Consistent with the \nGovernment  and  ADB  guidelines,  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  documented  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  documents.  The  PSC  will  ensure  compliance  with  government \nregulations on environmental permits, licenses, and clearance.

Manila \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nsubprojects  will  be  contingent  upon  prior  issuance  of  necessary  permits  or  licenses  and \nclearance by relevant government authorities and/or by ADB, as required.   \n \nC.  Policies  \n6.  A PCB\u2019s EMS embodies policies, procedures, and required capacity. The objectives of \nthe environmental policy are to (i) protect the environment, (ii) encourage the efficient use of \nnatural resources, and (iii) promote environmental improvement wherever possible. The national \npolicies constitute the basis for EMS polices in the PCBs. All the participating banks will comply \nwith  national  environmental  policies,  rules,  and  regulations.  The  Government\u2019s  National \nEnvironment Act 1981 is supported by conservation laws including the (i) Coast Conservation \nAct of 1981, requiring environmental assessment for projects undertaken in coastal areas; (ii) \nSoil Conservation Act, which aims at erosion protection in areas highly susceptible to erosion; \n(iii) State Lands Ordinance provisions on control of water use from public sources; (iv) National \nWater Supply Board Act provisions on protecting water supply sources; (v) Fauna and Flora \nProtection Ordinance, which aims at conservation of forest and wildlife and provides the basic \nlegal framework for environmental assessment in Sri Lanka; and (vi) Land Acquisition Act and \nNational Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Other relevant regulations include bylaws related to \npollution control, health and sanitation, and disposal of solid waste; the Geological Survey and \nMining Bureau Act; Motor Traffic Act; Ministry of Defense and Police Policies; Agrarian Services \nAct; and Antiquities Ordinance.  \n7.  The PCBs will ensure subprojects\u2019 compliance with national environmental policies and \nregulations as well as with ADB\u2019s applicable environmental assessment requirements. The \nnational policies and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements reinforce each other.   \n8.  The PCBs will only invest in subprojects:  \n(i)  if their activities are outside of the Subproject Exclusion List (Supplementary \nAppendix F); \n(ii)  that take account of the environmental impacts of their operations and take steps \nto avoid, minimize, and mitigate any risks; \n(iii)  that are designed, implemented, and operated in compliance with all government \nenvironmental regulations and requirements, as well as with ADB\u2019s requirements, \nas applicable; and \n(iv)  that take account of relevant international environmental agreements. \n \n9.  The operational principles of a PCB\u2019s environmental policy include: \n(i)  Ensuring  that  environmental  safeguards  as  defined  by  the  Environmental \nProtection Act, and rules and regulations issued by the Central Environmental \nAuthority of Sri Lanka are integrated into project design prior to its financing and \ncomplied with during construction and operation. \n(ii)  Adopting a risk classification system in accordance with government procedure \nor international best practice. \n(iii)  Ensuring that no activities on the \u2018exclusion list\u2019 of activities are financed or \nfostered by the PCBs.  \n(iv)  Where potential adverse social and environmental impacts are exptected, the \nmeasures to prevent these from  occurring in the first place are preferred to \nmeasures seeking minimization, mitigation, or compensation. \n(v)  Disclosing relevant information and consulting with project-affected people for \nsubprojects with potential adverse environmental and social impacts.  \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n(vi)  Where required to mitigate significant adverse environmental risk, ensuring that \nrelevant  international  best  practices,  are  integrated  into  project  design, \nimplementation,  construction and operation. \n(vii)  Encouraging  project  promoters  and  other  project  partners  to  adopt \nenvironmentally sound practices. \n(viii)  Where  subprojects  have  potential  significant  adverse  impacts,  ensuring \nindependent compliance review by the PCB.  \n(ix)  Ensuring transparency in and commitment to continual improvement of its EMS. \n \nD.   Procedure  \n10.  The  procedure  below  provides  a  basis  for  the  PCBs  to  develop  their  own  set  of \nprocedures and requirements to avoid, minimize, mitigate, manage, and monitor subproject \nimpacts,  as  appropriate  to  the  types  and  scale  of  subprojects,  and  regarding  the  nature, \nsensitivity, and magnitude of subprojects\u2019 impacts.   \n \n1.  Screening \n \n11.  Please find below the necessary screening measures that need to be implemented by \nthe PCB to ensure that the subprojects are not included in the exclusion list. \n \n(i)  The PCB will screen the proposed subproject to ensure that it is not included in \nthe Exclusion List.   \n(ii)  The PCB\u2019s safeguard officer will carry out a rapid environmental assessment and \nprepare a brief report to summarize the results, including issues identified that \nneed to be addressed and the type and scope of environment assessments \nneeding to be conducted to mitigate the potential impacts.   \n(iii)  Using project classification criteria, the proposed subproject will be classified \naccording to the significance of environmental impacts. The category determines \nthe  level  and  type  of  environmental  assessment  (initial  environmental \nexamination or environmental impact assessment) to be conducted to address \npotential environmental impacts.  \n \n2.  Environment Assessment and Review \n \n12.  Please find below the required environment assessment and review that has to be \nundertaken by the PCBs. \n \n(i)  After reviewing the proposal, the PCB will recommend the level of environmental \nassessment to be prepared if a feasibility study has not been prepared for the \nsubproject.  If  potential  environmental  impacts  are  few  in  number,  generally \nsite-specific,  largely  reversible,  and  readily  addressed  through  mitigation \nmeasures, narrower scope assessments (e.g., initial environmental examination) \nmay  be  conducted.  If  potential  significant  adverse  impacts  are  diverse, \nirreversible,  or  unprecedented,  a  comprehensive  environmental  assessment, \nsuch as an environmental impact assessment (EIA), is needed. If an EIA is \nrequired,  it  must  include  an  environmental  management  plan  consisting  of \nmitigation measures for identified environmental impacts, staffing, monitoring and \nreporting arrangements, and budget.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  39 \n(ii)  If a feasibility study has been done and an environmental assessment report2 has \nalready been prepared, the PCB will conduct a desk review of the environmental \nassessment report to ensure the adequacy of the environmental management \nplan to manage the risks, as well as to ensure compliance with all government \nenvironmental  regulations  and  requirements  and,  as  applicable,  ADB \nenvironmental assessment requirements. \n(iii)  The PCB should ensure that clients comply with the requirement for consultation \nwith project-affected people that is preceded by information disclosure to those \npeople. Information relevant to a subproject\u2019s environmental issues is disclosed \nand consultation with subproject-affected people is done at the early stage of \nenvironmental assessment work so that the views of the affected people are \ntaken into account in project design. For category A projects, consultation should \nbe done twice, with the second consultation process occurring when the draft EIA \nreport is available. Consultation will continue during implementation. As required, \nthe PCB will establish a grievance mechanism as part of its project management \nsystem.   \n(iv)  The  PCB  will  inform  its  client  about  the  applicable  Government  and  ADB \nenvironmental requirements. \n(v)  If the subproject to be funded is an existing facility, the PCB will conduct an \nenvironmental  audit  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  all  environmental \nareas  of  concern  at  the  existing  facility.  The  audit  identifies  and  justifies \nappropriate measures to mitigate the areas of concern, estimate the cost of the \nmeasures, and recommend a schedule for implementing them.   \n(vi)  The PCB will conduct a site visit to validate or update the information or to verify \nthe findings of an EA or audit report (if already available).   \n(vii)  The  safeguard  officer/project  team  will  present  the  initial  findings  on  the \nenvironment  to  the  committee  (e.g.,  Credit/Investment  Committee)  which  is \nresponsible for approving the full credit appraisal of the proposed subproject. The \nsafeguard  compliance  officer,  reporting  to  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  wil \nprovide an independent view of the risks and assigns an environmental risk \nrating for discussion by the Financial Committee  and Credit Committee.  \n(viii)  For any category A and environmentally sensitive category B subproject, the \nPCB  will  be  required  to  obtain  ADB\u2019s  clearance  of  the  environmental \nassessment.  For  these  category  A  and  sensitive  B  subprojects,  a  summary \nenvironmental assessment must also be disclosed to the public, and a full round \nof public consultation must be completed, for a period of at least 120 days before \nthe subproject is approved. A detailed environmental assessment report will be \nprepared for approval by ADB before the subproject is approved.  \n(ix)  The safeguard officer will conduct an indepth review of environmental plans \nincluding the budget  Review will also be made of clearances and permits from \nthe  CEA,  and  relevant  local  authority.  The  legal  officer  formulates  legal \nagreements with the subproject sponsor on safeguards. The safeguard officer \nalso assists the client in preparating tender documents to ensure implementation \nby contractors of agreed mitigation measures. \n(x)  The results of due diligence from the previous steps are reflected in the feasibility \nand  appraisal  reports  which  highlight  the  recommended  environmental \nmanagement or corrective action plan to mitigate the risk. \n                                                 \n2  Environment assessment report is a generic term that refers to initial environmental examination, environmental \nimpact assessment, or an environmental audit report. \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \n  3.   Monitoring and Supervision \n13.  During subproject implementation, the PCBs will monitor and supervise implementation \nof  subprojects  with  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  review  and  monitoring \nactivities of the PCBs, include, but are not limited to, the following activities: \n(i)  Conducting site visits of projects with environmental risks and impacts. These visits \noccur during due diligence but more often occur at the implementation stage. \n(ii)  Reviewing project performance on the basis of the client\u2019s commitments in the \nlegal agreement, as reported by the client\u2019s monitoring reports, and, where \nrelevant, reviewing with the client any performance improvement requirements.  \n(iii)  If  changing  project  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse  environmental \nimpacts, revising the environmental management plan and working with the client \nto address those impacts. \n(iv)  Requiring clients to notify the PCB immediately of any accidents and incidents \n(e.g., spillages) that have or are likely to have a material adverse effect on the \nenvironment, including any remedial action planned or taken by the company in \nresponse to the accident or incident.   \n(v)  If  the  client  fails  to  comply  with  its  environmental  commitments,  as \nexpressed in the legal agreement, working with the client to bring it back into \ncompliance  to  the  extent  feasible,  and,  if  the  client  fails  to  reestablish \ncompliance, exercising remedies when appropriate. \n \n  4.   Reporting  \n14.  The PCBs will prepare and submit annual environmental compliance monitoring reports \nto ADB within 90 days after the close of their respective financial years.  \n \n15.  In  the  event  that  a  significant  environment-related  accident  or  incident  occurs  in  a \nsubproject, the  PCB  will  notify  the  project  steering  committee  and  ADB  immediately  upon \nbecoming aware of the matter and indicate the proposed corrective actions to be taken. Upon \nthe request of ADB, the PCB will arrange access for ADB staff to visit subprojects to verify \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policies. \n \nE.  Use of Independent Experts \n \n16.  Financial intermediaries for subprojects with potential significant adverse impacts may  \ncommission independent environmental experts to conduct full or partial environmental audits if \nthe  information  collected  at  screening  or  any  other  stage  indicates  potentially  significant \nenvironmental risks and liabilities (e.g., due to regulatory noncompliance or site contamination).   \nF.  Capacity \n17.  The PCBs will endeavor to achieve high standards of EMS practice by recruiting staff or \nconsultants with environmental management skills and through in-house or external training \nprograms.3 Some specialist staff will be required to drive the internal process. A senior member \nof the management team will be appointed to drive the program internally and take responsibility \nfor designing, if applicable, and implementing the EMS. All activities related to the environment \nwill be coordinated by a dedicated environment staff in the projects department.  \n                                                 \n3  The PCBs are encouraged to send representatives to participate in relevant training programs sponsored by ADB \nand IFC.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  41 \n18.  In addition, it is recommended that a separate function of the EMS compliance officer be \nestablished to assist the credit function in evaluating, monitoring, and managing all matters \ninvolving EMS risk. \n \n19.  By providing additional training, as required, the four participating banks will ensure that \ntheir safeguard officers are qualified to play their roles and to discharge their responsibilities.  \n \nG.   Guidelines and Handbook \n \n20.  The PCBs are also to have available an environmental guidebook for clients to provide \nguidance on applicable environmental requirements and good practices.  \n \n \n \n ", "42      Appendix 6 \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DUE DILIGENCE OF PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS   \n \n \nA.

Eligible  PCBs.  Based  on  application  of  the  above  criteria,  the  PCBs  eligible  for \nonlending of the credit line consist of CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB.4  In addition to this appendix, \nfurther details on PCB due diligence are provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB.  Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited (CB) \n \n9.  Background. CB was established in 1969. It recorded high loan growth in 2005 and is \ncurrently the largest private sector bank in Sri Lanka, with assets of SLRs180.1 billion as of the \nend of 2005 (up from SLRs138 billion at end-2004). The bank\u2019s major shareholders are DFCC \nBank (29.77%), International Finance Corporation (IFC) (14.99%), Al Mashal Investment Group \n(10%), and SLIC-Life Fund (5.33%).   \n \n10.  Corporate  Governance.  CB  has  complied  with  a  majority  of  the  good  corporate \ngovernance practices recommended by ICA of Sri Lanka and CBSL. CB employs so-called \n\"enterprise  governance,\"  which  is  a  combination  of  business  governance  and  corporate \ngovernance to ensure that strategic goals are aligned and good management is achieved and \nleads to corporate success and value creation. The structures promote effective identification, \nmonitoring, and management of material business risks. The procedures ensure implementation \nof  financial  disclosure  requirements  and  compliance  with  statutory  as  well  as  regulatory \nrequirements. \n \n11.  SME Outreach and Branch Network. The bank has 134 branches across the island \nand  has  a  far-reaching  presence  in  the  country.  Along  with  its  growing  branch  network, \nexposure to SMEs has increased considerably since the mid-1990s. A significant portion of \nCB\u2019s new loans were SMEs and to a lesser extent consumers. Collectively, retail banking \n(which includes SME lending) and consumer banking accounted for around 45% of its total loan \nportfolio as of the end of 2005 (i.e., approximately SLRs56 billion).   \n \n12.  The bank\u2019s SME loan profile indicates significant lending to areas outside Colombo, \nGampaha, and Kalutara. For the last 2-1/2 years, the number of SME loans to districts outside \nColombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara, has hovered around 81% of the total number of SME loans. \nFurthermore, the volume of SME loans outstanding in districts outside Colombo, Gampaha, and \n                                                 \n2  Each PCB will provide such written policies and procedures.  \n3  Capacity building in these and other market demand-side activities are being strengthened in the PCBs through \nIFC\u2019s SEDF technical assistance program focusing on SME lending capacity. \n4  Sampath has a lending restriction regarding the killing of livestock. \n ", "44      Appendix 6 \nKalutara was around 70% of the total volume of SME loans outstanding during 31 December \n2004 to 30 June 2006.   \n \n13.  Risk Management. Historically, CB\u2019s risk management practices have been considered \nsound. CB\u2019s work procedures, system of controls, and management information system are \nconsidered  to  be  of  a  relatively  good  standard.  This  is  also  reflected  in  its  asset  quality \nindicators. It has decided to set up a full-fledged independent risk management department in \nthe Bank, with a view to undertaking an integrated approach to risk management. Once fully set \nup and operational, the bank\u2019s entire risk management process is expected to be in line with \ninternational best practices (i.e. Basel II compliant). \n \n14.  CB, along with the three other banks, has signed a memorandum of understanding \n(MOU) with IFC\u2019s South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) that would lead to a \ntechnical assistance for capacity building in CB and include such measures as strengthening \nrisk management processes and procedures.  \n \n15.  Rating. CB is rated AA+ (investment grade of a very high credit quality) by Fitch Ratings \nLanka. \n \nC.  DFCC Bank (DFCC) \n \n16.  Background. DFCC was formed as a development finance institution with the objective \nof fostering economic growth in Sri Lanka. DFCC\u2019s core activity is the provision of long-term \nproject finance and its total assets were SLRs45.04 billion as at end of FY2005. Though state \nsupport  was  injected  through  state-owned  institutions,  DFCC  was  formed  as  a  so-called \n\u201cprivate\u201d entity and was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1956. Currently, DFCC is \nmajority owned by the private sector, with the Stassens Group owning about 19% of DFCC\u2019s \nequity and Commercial Bank of Ceylon having a 13.5% stake. Other major shareholders include \na major public sector shareholder, Bank of Ceylon, which owns 14.7%. \n \n17.  Corporate Governance. DFCC is guided by the guidelines issued by the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka (CBSL), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants  (ICA)  of  Sri  Lanka  with  regard  to  implementing  best  practices  in  corporate \ngovernance. The structures promote effective identification, monitoring, and management of \nmaterial  business  risks.  The  procedures  ensure  implementation  of  financial  disclosure \nrequirements and compliance with statutory as well as regulatory requirements. \n \n18.  SME  Outreach  and  Branch  Network.  DFCC  has  11  full-fledged  branches  with \nprofessional staff in every province except for the northeast (two branches are coastal and the \nother nine are in major provincial towns). Each regional branch covers a wide catchment area, \nranging from 50 to 100 kilometers from the provincial capitals. For the financial year that \nconcluded at the end of March 2006, DFCC accommodated 2,000 new SME clients who had \nhad no previous relationship with the bank, and a total credit of SLRs5.546 billion (i.e., 55% of \ntotal  SME  credit  approval  for  the  year)  was  approved  for  branches  outside  Colombo  and \nGampaha. The portfolio of SME loans outstanding has increased, on average, by SLRs1.2 \nbillion for the last 2 years outside Colombo and Gampaha (as of March 2004, SLRs7.22 billion; \nas of March 2005, SLRs8.105 billion; and as of March 2006, SLRs9.55 billion).   \n \n19.  Risk Management. Over the years, DFCC\u2019s risk management function has been refined \nand  strengthened  along  the  lines  of  modern  risk  management  practices.  DFCC\u2019s  risk \nmanagement  framework  has  been  considered  to  be  relatively  good  in  the  local  context. \n ", "  Appendix 6  45 \nCommittees  with  defined  responsibilities,  along  with  well-structured  and  clearly  articulated \nprocedures and demarcated accountability contribute to the risk management framework. A \ncentralized  database  incorporating  data  from  branches  further  enhances  the  bank\u2019s  risk \nmanagement capabilities. In preparation for Basel II, a more sophisticated risk rating system \ndeveloped with the aid of external consultants is to be implemented. Ultimately, the new rating \nsystem will enable rating transitions to be monitored in order to facilitate a transition to the \nInternal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach.  \n \n20.  DFCC has signed an MOU with IFC\u2019s SEDF that would lead to technical assistance for \nfurther capacity building of DFCC and include such measures as strengthening the processes \nand procedures of risk management. \n  \n21.  Rating. DFCC is rated AA (investment grade of a very high credit quality) by Fitch \nRatings Lanka. \n \nD.  National Development Bank of Sri Lanka PLC (NDB) \n \n22.  Background.  NDB  of  Sri  Lanka  was  established  in  1979  as  a  fully  state-owned \ninstitution to provide project funding along with DFCC. In 1993, it was privatized with ADB \nsupport and 61% of the capital floated on the stock exchange. The state has adopted a hands-\noff approach towards both NDB of Sri Lanka and DFCC from the start, letting the banks make \nbusiness decisions freely. As a result, the performance and financial health of both banks have \nbeen relatively good. \n \n23.  Corporate  Governance.  NDB  supports  the recommendations  of  the  Committee  on \nFinancial Aspects of Corporate Governance initiated by ICA of Sri Lanka, including the aspects \nreferred  to  by  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission.  NDB  has  adopted  (i)  an  appropriate \nstructure for the Board of Directors and for appointments to the Board; (ii) internal controls \nsystems  including  internal  and  external  audits,  as  well  as  risk  management  functions \nindependent of the business lines; (iii) effective internal and external information flows and \nappropriate financial reporting; and (iv) appropriate financial and managerial incentives tied to \naccountability and responsibility. \n \n24.  SME Outreach and Branch Network. NDB\u2019s branch network expanded to 24 branches \nin  FY2005  from  13  in  FY2004.  As  of  the  end  of  June  2006,  NDB\u2019s  branch  network  had \nincreased to 33 branches, out of which 13 are solely dedicated to SME lending. The expanded \nbranch network will support growth in its consumer and SME segments. It is estimated that 26 \nbranches are committed to both SME and consumer segments. Direct SME credit approvals for \n2005 through the branches stood at SLRs2.425 billion for 844 projects, an increase of 26% over \nthe previous year\u2019s figure of SLRs1.917 billion for 794 projects. The SME credit portfolio was at \nSLRs4.127 billion in 2005, an increase of 14% over the 2004 figure of SLRs3.608 billion. As of \nthe end of June 2006, SME lending volume was around 21% of total lending volume, and the \ntotal number of facilities and loans offered to SMEs was 74% of the total number of facilities and \nloans offered by NDB.   \n \n25.  As of the end of June 2006, NDB\u2019s SME loan profile indicated significant lending to \nareas outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara. Around 6.6% of the SME facilities offered by \nthe Colombo branch were distributed to districts outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara. \nSimilarly, 10.3% of the total SME lending volume of the Colombo branch was distributed to \ndistricts outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara. Furthermore, the total number of facilities \nand loans offered to SMEs outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara represented 69% of SME \n ", "46      Appendix 6 \nfacilities and loans. The SME lending volume outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara was \naround 55% of total SME lending volume.   \n \n26.  Risk Management. NDB\u2019s risk management procedures have improved since FY2001, \nboth in terms of the framework and its application. Management has emphasized maintaining \nasset quality and earning an adequate return on equity. In preparation for Basel II compliance, \nthe bank intends to implement a more sophisticated risk rating system developed with the aid of \nexternal consultants. It will enable rating transitions to be monitored in order to facilitate a \ntransition to the IRB approach. Following modern credit risk management practices, NDB is \ntaking an overall portfolio view in managing risk. However, it will review large exposures and \nhigh-risk deals on a transaction basis. NDB\u2019s risk appetite is conservative in the area of project \nlending, as demonstrated by single borrower limits set at 20% of equity for a company and 25% \nfor a group, compared with the regulatory prudential limit of 30% of equity. \n \n27.  NDB, along with the three other banks, has signed an MOU with IFC\u2019s SEDF that would \nlead  to  technical  assistance  for  capacity  building  at  NDB  and  which  would  include  such \nmeasures as strengthening risk management processes and procedures.  \n \n28.  Rating. NDB is rated AA (investment grade of a very high credit quality) by Fitch Ratings \nLanka. \n \nE.  Sampath Bank Limited (SB) \n \n29.  Background. This bank is the smallest of the six major domestic banks, with assets as \nof the end of December 2005 totaling SLRs87.5 billion, but it ranks relatively well by such \nindicators  as  profitability  and  efficiency.  The  bank\u2019s  network  at  end-2005  comprised  84 \nbranches and 95 ATMs, supported by such other delivery channels as telebanking and internet \nbanking. SB is considered a technologically advanced bank in the local context. \n \n30.  Corporate  Governance. SB is committed to strong corporate governance, which is \nreflected in its structure, processes, and governance procedures. It has adopted practices to \nfulfill its objectives of transparency, integrity, disclosure, and accountability in all dealings. SB \nhas implemented (i) an appropriate structure for the Board of Directors and appointments to the \nBoard; (ii) effective internal controls systems that include internal and external audits, as well as \nrisk management functions independent of the business lines; (iii) unimpeded internal and \nexternal information channels and appropriate financial reporting; and (iv) appropriate financial \nand managerial incentives tied to accountability and responsibility. \n \n31.  SME Outreach and Branch Network. Over the last 5 years, SB\u2019s network has doubled, \nand the bank had 83 branches as of the end December 2005. The well disbursed network of \nSB\u2019s branches across the island will facilitate SME lending outside the Colombo area. SB has \nbeen actively involved in SME credit lines through Japan Bank for International Cooperation, \nAsian Development Bank, and other donors. \n \n32.  Risk  Management.  SB,  along  with  other  Sri  Lanka  banks,  is  in  the  process  of \nimplementing an enterprise-wide risk management approach and putting into place the building \nblocks necessary to function within a Basel II environment (i.e., building a database of credit \nhistory to evaluate probability of default, rating transitions, and loss experience). Given SB\u2019s \nrobust IT infrastructure, the bank is positioned well to successfully implement the measures. \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  47 \n33.  SB, along with the three other banks, has signed an MOU with IFC\u2019s SEDF that would \nlead to technical assistance for capacity building in SB that would include such measures as \nstrengthening risk management processes and procedures.  \n \n34.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP) seeks to enhance small and \nmedium enterprise (SME) development by addressing barriers to growth faced by SMEs. The Project\u2019s \nmain thrust is to foster partnership and clustering between firms at different levels of value chains of \ndifferent sizes. This is an integrated approach that tackles SMEs\u2019 development constraints in the areas of \nfinance, information, marketing, management, and inputs. The development of such SME value chain \nclusters will boost opportunities for SMEs to engage in commercially viable business activities. The \nexperience of a number of countries has demonstrated the soundness and efficacy of this approach. By \nthis approach, the Project will facilitate development of a competitive SME sector that is capable of growth \nand expansion, and it will directly contribute to poverty reduction. Furthermore, a dynamic SME sector will \ngenerate employment, contribute to reducing direct government budget support to SMEs and free up \nresources for infrastructure and social development. All these factors will lead to reduced poverty.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe SMERDP is indirectly pro-poor in supporting the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy: pro-poor sustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development. Pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the Project\u2019s focus on measures to improve SME \ngrowth and development in the nonurban and rural areas that have the highest incidence of poverty in the \ncountry. The SMERDP is timely, as economic growth and development have stagnated in the nonurban \nand rural areas. To facilitate good governance, the SMERDP is strengthening a number of organizations\u2019 \ngovernance structures, namely those of the four private commercial or specialized banks (PCBs) involved. \nThis will contribute to the flow of improved services from these organizations to SMEs. By paying particular \nattention to the development of rural SMEs, the SMERDP will improve the incomes of rural households \nand increase employment opportunities for rural residents, including women, through establishing new \nSMEs or expanding existing SMEs. That, in turn, will foster social development. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nWidespread consultations were held with stakeholders, including SMEs, large corporations, banks and \nother financial institutions, nongovernment organizations, research institutions, SME business service \nproviders, government departments, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and various donor organizations. The \nfeedback from all these stakeholders has been carefully analyzed and reflected in the design of the loan. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe SMERDP aims to employ a consultative approach throughout its processing and implementation \nstages to ensure effective participation of stakeholders, generation of high quality action plans and \nrecommendations, and that the SMERDP delivers the desired economic and social outcomes. The action \nplans relate to conceptualization of SME value chain clusters to foster bankable projects and redress the \ngeographically skewed SME lending.

Executive Summary \n \n1.  The objective of the financial management assessment is to determine whether the \nentities  implementing  the  project  components  have  acceptable  financial  management \narrangements\u2014including  procedures  for  making  payments,  accounting  treatment  of \ntransactions, financial reporting, audit of financial statements, and internal control procedures\u2014\nto avoid misuse or misappropriation of funds and assets. The assessment indicates that the \nproject is being prepared in an area of low financial management risk, as the entities that will \nimplement the Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP) have \nsuccessfully undertaken (or are currently undertaking) similar lines of credit from numerous \ndonor agencies (including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB)]. \n   \n2.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  SMERDP  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nPlanning  (MOFP).  Each  eligible  private  commercial  or  specialized  bank  (PCB)  will  be  an \nimplementing agency (IA) and will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) in its relevant \noperational  department.  MOFP  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  that  will \noversee  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  comprise  six  members,  including \nrepresentatives of the MOFP, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), and the four PCBs. The PSC \nwill be chaired by the Secretary of MOFP or, in his absence, Deputy Secretary of MOFP. The \nPSC may, from time to time, co-opt representatives from other relevant agencies. CBSL will \nform and provide a secretariat to the PSC that will be responsible for coordinating the inputs of \nall PIUs, including benefit and impact monitoring reports, for consideration by the PSC. The \nresponsibility for major payments, accounting, and conduct of audit will remain with the PSC \nsecretariat.  \n   \nB.  Summary  Project  Description  and  Introduction  to  the  Financial  Management \nAssessment \n \n3.  The  proposed  SMERDP  seeks  to  facilitate  the  development  of  SMEs  outside  the \nwestern  province  of  Sri  Lanka,  with  the  specific  objective  of  reducing  regional  economic \ndisparities.  The  SMERDP  consists  of  a  project  loan  of  SDR  32,226,000  ($50.0  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for extending credit through four PCBs to \nregional SMEs and SME value chain clusters.  \n \n4.  Given the objective of the financial management assessment above, the arrangements \nare considered acceptable if the EA and PCBs are capable of making timely payments as they \nbecome due, recording correctly all transactions and balances, supporting the preparation of \nregular and reliable financial statements, and are subject to appropriate auditing. The financial \nmanagement assessment also provides stakeholders an opportunity to discuss any issues \nrelated to the proposed funds flow and financial management structure and finalize actions \nrequired to ensure sound financial management arrangements exist before loan effectiveness. \nThe financial management and accounting questionnaire was completed with the help of the \nEA, IA, and CBSL staffs, and the final version is attached with the report.  \n \nC.  Country Issues and Risks \n \n5.  The  framework  for  public  financial  accountability  in  Sri  Lanka  is  founded  on  the \nprinciples of governance associated with the model inherited from the British. This framework is \nwidely accepted as appropriate for the country. The primary accountability institutions and \n ", "    Appendix 10       53     \norganizations for financial management, control, audit, and legislative scrutiny, however, need \nto evolve in line with the changes in the more advanced democracies of a similar background. \n \n6.  Financial accountability at the subnational level is less developed than at the center. For \nexample, the control over funds is subject to less public scrutiny and financial reporting is less \nregular. In addition, provincial and local governments' dependency on the central government \nfor  funds,  results  in  duplication  of  effort  and  resources.  However,  results  based  budget \nindicators at the sub-national level are under preparation through the fiscal program of the \nGovernment  with  ADB.  On  the  other  hand,  some  state  owned  enterprises  experience \ninefficiencies.  The  Government  is  attempting  to  address  these  issues  through  various \ninterventions that are part of programs of Government with ADB.  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements  \n \n7.  The EA for the SMERDP will be the MOFP. Each eligible PCB will be an IA, establishing \na PIU in its relevant operational department not later than one month after loan effectiveness. \nMOFP will establish a PSC, not later than one month after loan effectiveness, that will oversee \nimplementation of the SMERDP. The PSC will comprise 6 members, including representatives \nof the MOFP, CBSL, and the 4 PCBs. The PSC will be chaired by the Secretary of MOFP or, in \nhis  absence,  Deputy  Secretary  of  MOFP.  The  committee  will  have  the  authority  to  make \ndecisions that are essential to ensure the progress of SMERDP. The PSC may, from time to \ntime, co-opt representatives from other relevant agencies. The committee will meet as needed, \nbut at least once every 2 months and will be responsible for the overall guidance to the PCBs \nand  the  direction  of  SMERDP  as  well  as  on  matters  related  to  financial  reporting  and \ndisbursements.  \n \n8.  CBSL  will  form  and  provide  a  secretariat  to  the  PSC  that  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  inputs  of  all  PIUs,  including  benefit  and  impact  monitoring  reports  for \nconsideration by the PSC. The PCB PIUs will be responsible for (i) coordinating with relevant \nPCB departments to ensure appraisal and management of subloans; (ii) ensuring that ADB \ninformation and reporting requirements related to PCBs and subloans are met; and (iii) ensuring \nthat all necessary submissions of accounts, related financial statements, and disbursement \nrecords are duly submitted through CBSL to the PSC. \n \nE.  Funds Flow Arrangements \n \n9.  The coursing of project loan funds will be undertaken through CBSL to the eligible PCBs \nfor regional SME lending. CBSL was deemed appropriate because of (i) CBSL\u2019s ready access \nto information pertaining to the continued eligibility of the PCBs, including financial soundness \nand capabilities of PCBs for providing credit to the SME sector; (ii) the strengthening of CBSL\u2019s \nregulatory and supervisory capacity under the World Bank\u2019s Central Bank Strengthening Project \nthat encompasses support for (a) CBSL reorganization and restructuring by reforming human \nresources  policies,  outsourcing  and  training,  and  skills  upgrading  of  audit  and  other \ndepartments, (b) training and technical support for the payments and securities clearing and \nsettlements system, and (c) financial market regulation and development; (iii) CBSL\u2019s role in \nsetting corporate governance standards for banks;1 and (iv) CBSL\u2019s key role through its recently \nestablished Financial Intelligence Unit to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. \n \n                                                 \n1  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2002. Code of Corporate Governance for Banks and Financial Institutions. Colombo. \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \n10.  A project imprest account will be opened and maintained at CBSL for the SMERDP. \nCBSL will inform MOFP about receipt of ADB funds into the imprest account (which is in foreign \ncurrency).  MOFP  then  will  direct  CBSL  to  convert  and  transfer  the  requested  amount  in \nequivalent local currency. The PSC will advise CBSL to release funds to a second-generation \nimprest account set up in each IA to draw their equitable share from the first-generation imprest \naccount.  The  requisition  forms  submitted  by  the  PSC  would  require  joint  signatures.  One \nsignatory will be the project director of the PSC secretariat and the other signatory will be any \none of the other three PSC secretariat staff.   \n \nF.  Staffing Arrangements  \n \n11.  The PSC\u2019s financial management infrastructure will be adequate to provide the requisite \nfinancial management arrangements for the Project because qualified regular CBSL staff will be \nemployed for the various positions within the PSC secretariat. The position of project director at \nthe PSC secretariat will be assigned to the director of the Regional Development Department at \nCBSL while the position of alternate project director will be assigned to the deputy director of the \nRegional Development Department. The project director at the PSC secretariat will (i) liaise with \nthe  PSC,  (ii)  liaise  with  all  PIU  project  directors,  and  (iii)  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nsupervision of the PSC secretariat. The major responsibilities of the alternate project director will \ninclude overseeing the budgeting, accounting, and reporting of all financial transactions related \nto  implementing  the  Project  under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  project  director.  For  the \nreporting  of  all  financial  transactions,  the  alternate  project  director  will  be  assisted  by  the \nappointment  of  a  finance  officer  from  CBSL\u2019s  Regional  Development  Department.  For  the \nbudgeting and accounting, the alternate project director will be assisted by the appointment of \nan accounts officer from CBSL\u2019s Regional Development Department.  \n \n12.  Since all four PCBs have undertaken (or are currently undertaking) similar lines of credit \nfrom numerous donor agencies (including ADB), and as qualified regular PCB staff will be \nemployed that have the relevant experience, the financial management infrastructure of the four \nPCB PIUs will be adequate to provide the requisite financial management arrangements for the \nProject. Each PCB will establish a PIU in its relevant operational department (i.e., the SME \ndepartment). The director of the SME department in each PCB will be the project director of \neach PIU while the position of alternate project director will be assigned to the deputy director of \nthe SME department. The project director for each PIU will (i) liaise with the PSC, (ii) liaise with \nthe project director of the PSC secretariat as well as project directors of other PIUs, and (iii) be \nresponsible for overall supervision of the PIU. Under the overall supervision of the project \ndirector, the major responsibilities of the alternate project director in each PIU will include \noverseeing  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  of  all  financial  transactions  related  to \nimplementing the allocated funds of the PCB. For the reporting of all financial transactions, the \nalternate project director will be assisted by the appointment of a finance officer from the PCB \nSME  department.  For  the  budgeting  and  accounting,  the  alternate  project  director  will  be \nassisted by the appointment of an accounts officer from the PCB\u2019s SME department.  \n \nG.  Accounting Policies and Procedures and Financial Reporting  \n \n13.  The  PCBs  employ  accrual-based  accounting,  with  cash  accounting  only  for \nnonperforming loans as mandated by CBSL\u2019s prudential requirements. The PCBs follow Sri \nLanka Accounting Standards, which correspond with international accounting standards. CBSL \nutilizes an accrual basis of accounting and follows International Financial Reporting Standards. \nMOFP uses cash-basis accounting, but it is planning a migration to full accrual accounting in the \nnext 3 to 4 years. \n ", "    Appendix 10       55     \n \n14.  The PCBs will have their accounts and financial statements (balance sheet, income \nstatement, and statement of sources and applications of funds) audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The PCBs will submit, through CBSL, to the EA and ADB their audited \naccounts and financial statements not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. In \naddition, the PCBs will submit semiannual unaudited accounts to CBSL. \n \n15.  Through CBSL, the EA will (i) maintain consistent records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  goods  and services  financed  from  proceeds  of  the  SMERDP,  (ii)  ensure  separate \naccounts  for  each  project  loan  under  an  IA,  (iii)  ensure  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  are  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards  by \nauditors acceptable to ADB, and (iv) submit to ADB certified audited accounts and financial \nstatements within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year.   \n \n16.  SMERDP reports prepared by the PSC secretariat based on inputs from PIUs will be \nprovided quarterly for the PSC, EA, and ADB. The reports will contain (i) descriptions of the \nprogress made during the period, (ii) changes to the implementation schedule, if any, (iii) \nproblems/difficulties encountered and the remedial actions taken, (iv) the work to be carried-out \nin the next period, and (v) a summary financial account for the loan with expenditures to date. \nWithin 3 months of the Project\u2019s completion, the EA, through the PCBs, will furnish to the ADB a \nproject completion report containing a detailed evaluation of social and economic impact, as \nwell as other details as may be requested by the ADB.   \n  \nH.  Information Systems \n \n17.  Since CBSL and all four PCBs have undertaken (or are currently undertaking) similar \nlines of credit from numerous donor agencies (including ADB), the management organization \nand processing systems of CBSL and the PIUs can produce satisfactory project financial reports \nthat  meet  the  requirements  of  SMERDP  financial  reporting.  These  systems  ensure  the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. The staff is adequately trained to maintain \nthe  systems.  The  accounting  practices  at  MOFP  have  been  computerized  by  employing \nsoftware known as the Computerization Integrated Government Accounting System (CIGAS) \nand that has been in use since its introduction in 1995. \n \nI.  Audit Arrangements  \n \n18.  The project accounts will also be audited by CBSL\u2019s internal auditor and the Auditor \nGeneral. The audited project financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of \nthe end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year or such other date as ADB may agree.    \n \nJ.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n19.  PSC will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections, collecting supporting \ndocuments, preparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate the \ntimely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Government will, \nimmediately after the loan becomes effective, open and maintain a project imprest account with \nCBSL for the SMERDP to be managed by the PSC. The initial advance to the imprest account \nwill be 6 months\u2019 worth of estimated expenditures, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. To facilitate implementation a second-generation imprest account will be set up in each \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \nPCB to draw its equitable share from the first-generation imprest account. ADB's statement of \nexpenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The \nmaximum individual payment permitted under the SOE procedure is $200,000 equivalent. \n \nK.  Action Plan \nTable A10: Action Plan \nNo.  Actions Required  Target Dates \n1.

Supervision Plan \n \n21.  The PSC will have the authority to make decisions that are essential to ensuring the \nprogress of the SMERDP. The committee will meet as needed, but at least once every 2 \nmonths. It will be responsible for overall guidance to the PCBs and direction of the SMERDP as \nwell as on matters related to financial reporting and disbursements.  \n \nN.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n22.  MOFP,  CBSL,  and  all  four  PCBs  have  successfully  undertaken  (or  are  currently \nundertaking) similar lines of credit from numerous donor agencies (including the World Bank \nand ADB). As a result, the financial management capacities of the EA, CBSL, and the IAs are \ndeveloped to a satisfactory level to ensure smooth functioning of the SMERDP. \n ", "Appendix 11  57\nGOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION RISK ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  This assessment considers (i) relevant governance issues in the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP); (ii) relevant risk analysis of the SMERDP; \n(iii) controls for corruption at the sector and project levels; and (iv) recommendations on how the \nfindings of the assessment can be incorporated into the design of the Project. \n2.  Relevant Governance Issues in SMERDP. Governance issues with respect to the \nGovernment\u2019s SMERDP can be considered along the following lines: (i) regional inequality and \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs), (ii) legislative and policy framework, (iii) institutional \ndimensions, and (iv) accountability and transparency. \n3.  Regional Inequality and SMEs. Regional inequality is a major developmental challenge \nin Sri Lanka. Further, such regional divergence has increased steadily since the early 1990s. \nThere is potential for SME-driven growth to correct regional disparities in specific sectors where \nperformance has been relatively unsatisfactory in terms of quality, waste, and distribution.  \n \n4.  Legislative and Policy Framework. The Government\u2019s past measures for supporting \nregional enterprises and SMEs have focused on the state\u2019s trying to substitute the role of \nmarkets by subsidizing or controlling interest rates and facilitating lending through state-owned \nfinancial enterprises. Such a policy has not been sustainable and effective. More recently, the \nGovernment has accepted that financing of SMEs should be left to the market with private \nsector engagement whereby bankable and commercially feasible SME projects are funded and \nestablished.   \n \n5.  Institutional  Dimensions.  SMEs  are  institutionally  weak  as  business  enterprises \nbecause of limited production and technical capacity, inadequate market support services, small \nsize of operation, lack of access to business information, and low-quality products. \n \n6.  Accountability and Transparency. The accounting systems and information disclosure \nof SMEs will have to be improved to remove information opaqueness, since the Government is \nfacilitating the conversion of the manual format at Credit Rating Information Bureau (CRIB) to a \nweb-based electronic-enabled system by the end of 2007 to ensure availability of credit history \nfor all SMEs at the CRIB.  \n \nA.  Risks, Their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  Underlying Assumptions. The main assumptions in the risk analysis are that (i) the \nGovernment will stay the course in its objective and intention for regional SME development, (ii) \nthe legal and institutional reforms brought about to date will be sustained in the immediate \nfuture, (iii) effective institution building and capacity development in key agencies will continue, \nand (iv) the Government shares the view that this assessment presents a thorough review of \nSME development risks.  \n \n8.  Risk Specification. The potential risks can be grouped into several categories: \n(i)  Legal risks include, for example, lack of legal provisions to deal with disputes on \nSME  loans  and  debt  recovery  as  well  as  inadequate  legislation  on  secured \ntransactions.   \n(ii)  Policy risks include, among others, reluctance of private sector banks to lend to \nregional SMEs since they are considered risky ventures. ", "58  Appendix 11 \n(iii)  Institutional risks include weak managerial and technical capacity and skills in \nSMEs, including reluctance of management graduates to work in regional SMEs.  \n(iv)  Regulatory risks include weak implementation of governance code and standards \nby Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and banks.  \n \n9.  Risk Severity. The risks highlighted in the paragraphs above are not all equally severe \nfor regional SME development and the Project. Table A11.1 provides a risk severity matrix, \nwhich gives an indication of the four types of risks based on severity.1 \n \nTable A11.1: Risk Severity Matrix \n  Impact (I) \n    5  4  3  2  1 \nVery High  High  Moderate  Low  Very Low\n   \n5  Very likely  Type I    Type II    Type III \n     \n\u2022 Weak managerial and technical     \ncapacity and skills in SMEs,   \nL)  including reluctance of \ng ( management graduates to work in \nn regional SMEs   \nri\nur 4  Likely  \u2022 Lack of legal provisions to deal with \u2022 SME authority not       \nc\nc disputes on SME loans and debt  adequately \no\nt  recovery    institutionalized to \nn\ne lead SME \nev development  \nof  3  Moderately  \u2022 Reluctance of private sector banks  \u2022 System at CRIB      Type IV \nod  likely  to lend to regional SMEs, including  does not capture    \no investment in medium- and long- credit history below \nh  \neli term loans, since they are  current threshold \nk considered risky ventures   \u2022 Inadequate \nLi\n\u2022 CBSL\u2019s ongoing internal reform  legislation on \nprograms discontinued, adversely  secured \naffecting SME development   transactions \n\u2022 Weak implementation of   \ngovernance code and standards by \nCBSL and banks  \n2  Unlikely           \nCBSL = Central Bank of Sri Lanka, CRIB = Credit Rating Information Bureau, SME = small and medium enterprise. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Proposed Mitigation Measures.

Controls for Corruption  \n \n11.  Effective adoption and implementation of the Code of Corporate Governance by the \nPCBs will be critical to ensure good governance and to check corrupt practices while lending to \nSMEs under the Project. To minimize the inherent investment risks in lending to regional SME \nprojects, PCBs will need to adhere to strict internal controls, checks and balances, and risk \nmanagement procedures. The regulatory and supervisory role of CBSL over the PCBs will be \nequally important to ensure corruption-free business practices.  \n \nC.  Recommendations \n12.  To enhance the design and implementation of the SMERDP, it is recommended to: \n(i)  incorporate good governance and anticorruption provisions in loan assurances, \n(ii)  get  stakeholder  concurrence  of  governance  and  corruption  risk  mitigation \nstrategies,  \n(iii)  acquire information during review missions on revised structures and processes \nwithin SMERDP to assess progress in managing governance and corruption \nrisks, and \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \n(iv)  revisit this assessment at a suitable opportunity in the project period to assess \nhow  conditions  may  have  been  more  (or  less)  favorable  for  effective \nimplementation. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20071212123429+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20071115110545+08'00'", "Title": "Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "MP6", "Keywords": "rrp: srilanka 36117, sri lankan small medium enterprises, regional development project, ", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice President  L.
