As  part  of  the  Country \nStrategy  and  Program  process,  ADB  is  carrying  out  private  sector  assessments  (PSAs)  to \nidentify constraints to PSD and address them through operations in various sectors. In addition, \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  carry  out  PSD  initiatives  with  assistance  from  other \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) and aid agencies. These PSD initiatives are often sector-\nspecific,  lack  horizontal  integration,  and  are  driven  by  sources  rather  than  by  the  DMCs'  own \nlong-term strategic vision or consideration of the overall picture of PSD.  \n \n2. \nWhile  PSD  is  supported  by  ADB  and  other  IFI  and  aid  agency  initiatives,  DMC \nownership  of  a  strategic  and  horizontally  integrated  PSD  agenda  will  greatly  enhance  these \nexternal efforts. In addition, DMC-driven PSD strategies will make government PSD intentions \nmore  transparent  to  investors,  allow  for  better  IFI  and  aid  coordination,  and  provide  a \nbenchmark for monitoring progress on PSD over time and across countries. As an initial step in \ndeveloping  country-driven  PSD  strategies  and  building  on  existing  ADB  PSD  initiatives,  this \nregional technical assistance (TA) will equip DMCs with increased understanding of approaches \nand steps for preparing a PSD strategy. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nISSUES \n\n3. \nMobilizing the enormous resources required to achieve the growth necessary for poverty \nreduction\u2014provision  of  infrastructure,  social  services,  and  employment\u2014will  not  be  possible \nwithout the active participation of the private sector. Continued budgetary pressures increasingly \nlead  DMCs  to  look  for  private  sector  investments  to  stimulate  growth  and  create  jobs.  Public \ninvolvement  in  the  productive  sectors  is  often  not  the  most  effective  use  of  scarce  funds, \nespecially if such use is at the expense of the social sectors where such funds are truly needed. \nPrivate  investment  and  management  in  properly  regulated  infrastructure  and  social  services \nprojects  can  relieve  pressure  on  public  budgets  and  enable  the  government  to  redirect  more \nresources to social spending. Consequently, governments need to shift away from playing the \nrole of an owner/producer and become a facilitator/regulator. \n \n4. \nADB is committed to expanding and expediting the role of the private sector through its \nPSD strategy adopted in 2000,4 and assists DMCs in building and reinforcing the confidence of \ninvestors  and  commercial  lenders.  Country  ownership  and  leadership  in  this  process  require \ncapacity  building  as  well  as  continued  dialogue  and  consultation  between  ADB  and  key \nstakeholders in and among the DMCs. ADB's LTSF states that ADB will help build the capacity \nof DMCs to design policies and reforms that create an effective enabling environment for PSD.  \n \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  1999.

Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2001-2015). Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 July 2002. \n4  ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nPSD  policy  statements  in  DMCs  are  general  in  nature.  Because  PSD  initiatives  from \n5. \ndifferent IFIs and aid agencies are predominantly sector-specific and anchored in Iine ministries \nresponsible for the sector, coordinating the initiatives is often suboptimal. Moreover, a number \nof  PSD  initiatives  take  place  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  when  aid  funds  become  available.  The \npresent situation demonstrates the need for assistance to give direction to the development of \ncountry-driven  PSD  strategies.  While  toolkits  have  been  developed  for  certain  areas  of  PSD \n(e.g., WB Toolkit for Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure, MIGA Investment Promotion \nToolkit),  no  overall  guidance  is  available  for  DMCs  on  how  to  take  a  coordinated  sequenced \napproach to PSD. \n \n6. \nInstitutional  capacity  building  and  policy  reform  for  PSD  require  a  strategic  approach. \nFollowing  a  request  from  their  shareholders,  IFIs  have  started  to  prepare  investment  climate \nstudies and private sector assessments and strategies. Even though these initiatives involve the \ngovernments of the DMCs, the IFIs appear to be really driving the process. According to ADB's \nMedium-Term Strategy,5 ADB must become more client focused. To play a key role in helping \ncreate  the  enabling  environment  so  that  the  private  sector  can  be  fully  involved  in  the \ndevelopment process ADB must support institutional capacity building and policy reform. \n  \n \n7. \nADB operates under the principle that DMCs must exercise leadership and ownership of \ntheir  own  development  agenda  and  priorities  by  demonstrating  initiative,  commitment,  and \naccountability. The TA will facilitate DMC ownership of the PSD agenda by providing guidance \non  the  concept  and  value  of  PSD  strategies  and  a  strategic  approach  to  developing  them.  In \nformulating  the  PSD  strategy  framework,  key  factors  to  be  considered  in  line  with  ADB's  PSD \nstrategy include (i) ADB's overarching objective of poverty reduction, which DMCs have adopted \nthrough poverty partnership agreements; (ii) the development challenges facing the region; (iii) \nexperience and lessons learned from ADB's existing PSD operations in the participating DMCs; \nand (iv) PSD-related activities of other IFIs.  \n \n \nThe  TA  will be a collaborative effort and will be implemented in close consultation with \n8. \nstakeholders.  Dissemination  will  include  an  interregional  workshop  for  governments,  IFIs, \nbusiness organizations, and the private sector to facilitate dialogue and interregional exchange. \nregional departments of ADB will be closely involved. The TA will also recommend how existing \nalliances  and  interregional  networks  (e.g.,  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC) \nPrivatization  Forum,  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  and  other  fora)  can  be \nutilized for continued exchange on the topic. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nPurpose and Output \n\n9. \nThe  TA  will  develop  a  coherent  framework  for  the  preparation  of  DMC-driven  PSD \nstrategies  that  promote  the  development  of  a  strong  and  dynamic  private  sector  able  to \ncontribute  to  long-term  economic  growth  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  A  coherent \nframework means a logical guide that outlines strategic initiatives for PSD from the policy level \ndown. The framework will provide DMCs with a conceptual guidance for a strategic approach to \ngrowth-oriented,  pro-poor  PSD  strategy  development,  and  will  highlight  how  to  identify  and \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2001. Medium-Term Strategy (2001-2005), Manila. \n\n\f \n \n\n3 \n\nfocus  on  priority  areas  for  PSD  in  an  integrated  manner.  The  goal  is  for  DMCs  to  have  an \nincreased understanding of how to formulate and integrate PSD strategies.  \n \n10. \nThe  TA  activities  are  targeted  at  senior  government  officials  and  policy  makers.  The \nactivities aim to increase awareness of the central role of the private sector in generating growth \nand  of  ways  of  improving  the  environment  in  which  the  private  sector  operates.  The  TA  will \ndemonstrate that a PSD strategy complements other policy interventions and will elaborate PSD \nissues  and  synergies  in  DMCs  through  capacity  building,  collaboration,  and  interregional \nexchange.  The  TA  will  produce  a  framework  report  for  the  development  of  PSD  strategies  for \nDMCs.  \n \nB. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nThe TA will comprise three activity clusters: (i) analysis of successes and failures of PSD \n11. \ninitiatives, (ii) framework development and capacity building, and (iii) promotion and knowledge \ndissemination.  Activities  will  be  carried  out  in  consultation  with  governments,  IFIs,  other  aid \nagencies, and the private sector. \n \n12. \nKey  activities  under  activity  cluster  (i)  include  research  and  analysis  of  PSD-related \ngovernment  statements;  successes  and  failures  of  key  PSD  initiatives  undertaken,  including \nsuccesses and failures with respect to phasing reforms in the participating DMCs as well as in \nother  countries  and  regions  of  the  world;  and  a  background  report  on  PSD  research  and \nanalysis for the participating DMCs. The consultants will write about the strategic PSD initiatives \nidentified  under  this  cluster  as  theme  papers  for  presentation  at  the  interregional  workshop. \nExamples  of  major  themes  include  good  practices  for  the  reform  of  fixed  property  rights  to \npromote land ownership and investment, reform of the collateral framework to promote financial \nmarket  development,  regulations  to  promote  the  private  provision  of  infrastructure,  creation  of \nequal  opportunities  (e.g.,  in  terms  of  taxation,  trade  or  foreign  exchange  policy),  prudential \nregulations,  business  registration  processes,  business  forums,  or  the  establishment  of \nregulatory  bodies.  Further  theme  papers  will  be  prepared  on  strategic  PSD  initiatives  in  other \ncountries  and  regions,  so  that  DMCs  can  benefit  from  the  lessons  learned  and  apply  what  is \nappropriate  for  their  situation.  The  findings  of  the  background  report  will  be  discussed  with \nrepresentatives of the respective governments during in-country consultations. \n \n13. \nActivity cluster (ii) will include identifying problems created and opportunities lost in the \nabsence of a coherent PSD strategy to facilitate an understanding and demonstrate the need for \na  strategic  approach  to  PSD,  translating  the  analytical  findings  of  the  previous  activity  cluster \ninto  a  framework  to  support  DMCs'  reform  agendas  in  support  of  PSD,  developing  PSD \nmonitoring/benchmarking  indicators,  developing  a  scorecard  for  PSD,  preparing  a  framework \nreport  for  developing  PSD  strategies,  liaising  with  other  IFIs  and  aid  agencies  on  the  tools \nprepared in this cluster, and providing capacity building on these tools. \n \n14. \nKey  activities  of  activity  cluster  (iii)  include  an  interregional  workshop  for  disseminating \nthe theme papers and the PSD strategy framework. Participants will be senior representatives \nfrom DMCs, IFIs, business organizations, and the private sector. To the extent possible, the TA \nwill attempt to use existing PSD-related networks to disseminate the TA results. The outputs will \nbe  presented  in  the  form  of  a  publication.  In  addition,  a  CD  Rom  will  be  prepared  and  web \ncontent for ADB\u2019s web site will be developed for wider dissemination.  \n \nThe budget allows for up to five DMCs to participate in the TA. The selected countries \n15. \ninclude Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. One other DMC may be added at a later \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nstage,  subject  to  the  government's  no  objection.  DMCs  from  all  regions  will  be  invited  to  the \ninterregional  workshop.  The  selection  criteria  for  participant  countries  include  the  expressed \ninterest  of  the  countries  to  participate  in  the  TA  and  to  reconsider  their  PSD  strategies \nthereafter,  experience  and  lessons  learned  from  existing  PSD-related  ADB  operations,6  the \nexistence  of  replicable  good-practice  PSD  initiatives,  manageability  due  to  size  and  central \nregime,  and  the  fact  that  PSAs  have  been  or  are  in  the  process  of  being  carried  out  in  all  of \nthese  countries,  except  for  Thailand.  The  suggested  inclusion  of  Thailand  follows  the \nPresident's visit to the country, during which ADB support for PSD and private sector operations \nwas expressed.  \n \nC. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $500,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \n\n16. \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Governance  and  Regional \n17. \nCooperation Division (RSGR) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will be \nresponsible for all TA activities. RSGR staff will supervise TA implementation and participate in \ndiscussions with stakeholders. The PSD committee established under ADB's revised business \nprocesses will serve as the TA team for reviewing and commenting on consultant\u2019s deliverables. \nThe  TA  activities  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  relevant  ongoing  ADB  activities  as  well  as \nthose  of  other  IFIs  and  aid  agencies.  Each  participating  DMC  will  nominate  a  high-level \ncounterpart to be responsible for the TA (at least director level). The counterpart will guide the \nconsultants'  research,  facilitate  access  to  relevant  government  agencies  and  officials,  and \nprovide the necessary documents for the TA.  \n \n18. \nConsulting  services  of  30.5  person-months  (8.5  international,  and  22  domestic)  will  be \nrequired. The consultant team hired through a firm will comprise three international consultants: \nPSD  specialist/team \nlegal/regulatory  expert,  with \nexperience  in  the  region.  The  international  consultants  will  be  supported  by  one  domestic \nconsultant per participant DMC. The domestic consultants will be experienced in PSD and will \nbe  recruited  to  effectively  interface  with  government  counterparts.  An  editor  and  a  domestic \nconsultant with experience in TA management and based in Manila will be recruited individually \nfor the study period. This consultant will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the \nTA,  communication  between  the  TA  stakeholders,  organizing  the  interregional  workshop  in \nManila, and coordinating the publication of the various outputs of the TA. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19. \nUsing  the  simplified  format  for  technical  proposals,  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Given the complexity of the area of expertise, the specialization required, \nand the scarcity of expertise in the area of PSD policy in the market, as well as the fact that the \nsuccess  of  this  highly  visible  TA  is  crucially  dependent  on  recruiting  the  best  consultants \navailable  in  the  area  of  PDS  policy,  the  quality-based  selection  method  will  be  applied  in \nselecting the consulting firm.  \n\nleader,  development  economist,  and \n\n                                                \n6  e.g. Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program; TA 3934-MON: Trade Policy Review; Loan VIE: Financial \nSector Program Loan (under processing); Loan 1800/1801-SRI: Private Sector Development Program Loan; Loan \n1894/1895-SRI: SME Sector Development Program; Loan 1729-PHI: LGU Infrastructure Development Facility. \n\n\f \n \n\n5 \n\n \n20. \nThe TA is expected to start in January 2003 and will be implemented over a period of 8 \nmonths.  Implementation  will  involve  an  interregional  workshop,  planned  after  6  months,  to \ndiscuss  the  outputs  of  the  TA.  The  main  participants  will  comprise  senior  level  government \nofficials  and  policy  makers.  Local  workshops\u2014including  capacity-building  workshops  on  the \nstudy  findings  for  relevant  line  ministries  and  other  stakeholders  in  each  DMC\u2014will  be  held \nduring TA implementation, as required. The consultants will submit an inception report 1 month \nafter  the  TA  starts;  an  interim  report  after  3  months;  a  draft  final  report,  including  a  draft \npublication,  after  5.5  months;  draft  inclusions  of  the  workshop  proceedings  1  week  after  the \nworkshop;  a  final  Report  and  final  inclusions  of  the  workshop  proceedings  2  weeks  after \ncomments on the respective documents are received; and the final publication by the end of the \nTA period. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n\n21. \nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nTowards  Developing  Country-Driven  Private  Sector  Development  Strategies,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n\n\f6 \n\nAppendix 2                                                                                      \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  FRAMEWORK \n\n \n \n\n \n \nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nIncreased  understanding \nby  developing  member \ncountries  (DMCs)  of  how \nto \nand \nformulate \nimplement  Private  Sector \nDevelopment \n(PSD) \nstrategies   \nPurpose \ncoherent \nDevelop \nframework \nthe \npreparation of DMC-driven \nPSD strategies  \n\nfor \n\na \n\nOutputs \nConceptual framework for \nthe development of DMC \nPSD strategies \nInterregional workshop for \ndisseminating regional TA \nfindings \nActivities \nPrepare PSD background \nand input report for up to \nfive study countries \nPrepare of PSD theme \npapers for participating \nDMCs and other countries \nPrepare diagnostic \nframework for DMC-\nowned Private Sector \nAssessments (PSAs) \nDevelop PSD \nbenchmarking indicators \nDevelop PSD scorecard \nFormulate PSD strategy \nframework \nDevelop web site content \n \nDevelop CD Rom for \ntraining purposes \nPrepare publication \nInputs \nConsulting Services \n \n \n \nWorkshops \n\n \n\n \nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n \n\n \nFoundation for viable PSD \nstrategies established \nInformed DMC decisions \non whether or not to \npursue PSD strategy \npreparation \n\n \nFramework for developing \nPSD strategies \nunderstood and accepted, \nand collaboration on PSD \nagenda among DMCs \nenhanced \n \nFramework developed \nand delivered \n \nWorkshop conducted \n \n \n \nPSD background and \ninput report prepared \n \n \nPSD theme papers \nprepared \n \nDiagnostic framework \ncompleted \n \nPSD benchmarking \nindicators prepared \nScorecard prepared \nPSD strategy framework \ncompleted \nWeb site content \ncompleted \nCD Rom prepared \n \nPublication prepared \n \n8.5 person-months \ninternational \n22 person-months \ndomestic \n$82,000 \n\n \nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n \n\n \nAssumptions \nand Risks \n \n\n \nFollow-up consultative \nmeetings between ADB and \nDMCs \n\n \n \n\n \nFeedback from workshops \nand consultative meetings \nConsultant\u2019s reports \n\n \nDMCs' political commitment to \nPSD \n\n \nFeedback from workshops \nDraft final report \nFinal report \n \n \n \n \nConsultant's reports, \nincluding: inception report,  \ninterim report, draft final \nreport , final report \nClose supervision by Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) \nstaff \n\n \nDMC capacity and sustained \ncommitment to PSD  \n \n\n \nConsultants adequately \nqualified and available \nGovernment cooperation \nEffective dissemination of  \nmaterials and messages \n\n \nConsultant's reports \nClose supervision by ADB \nstaff \n\n \nSuccessful recruitment and \ntimely fielding of adequately \nqualified consultants within \navailable budget \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nItem \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n7 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nCost a \n \n \n \n242,000 \n78,000 \n30,000 \n3,000 \n82,000 \n10,000 \n5,000 \n50,000 \n \n500,000 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\na.

As  part  of  the  Country \nStrategy  and  Program  process,  ADB  is  carrying  out  private  sector  assessments  (PSAs)  to \nidentify constraints to PSD and address them through operations in various sectors. In addition, \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  carry  out  PSD  initiatives  with  assistance  from  other \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) and aid agencies. These PSD initiatives are often sector-\nspecific,  lack  horizontal  integration,  and  are  driven  by  sources  rather  than  by  the  DMCs'  own \nlong-term strategic vision or consideration of the overall picture of PSD.  \n \n2. \nWhile  PSD  is  supported  by  ADB  and  other  IFI  and  aid  agency  initiatives,  DMC \nownership  of  a  strategic  and  horizontally  integrated  PSD  agenda  will  greatly  enhance  these \nexternal efforts. In addition, DMC-driven PSD strategies will make government PSD intentions \nmore  transparent  to  investors,  allow  for  better  IFI  and  aid  coordination,  and  provide  a \nbenchmark for monitoring progress on PSD over time and across countries. As an initial step in \ndeveloping  country-driven  PSD  strategies  and  building  on  existing  ADB  PSD  initiatives,  this \nregional technical assistance (TA) will equip DMCs with increased understanding of approaches \nand steps for preparing a PSD strategy. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n", "II. \n", "ISSUES \n", "3. \nMobilizing the enormous resources required to achieve the growth necessary for poverty \nreduction\u2014provision  of  infrastructure,  social  services,  and  employment\u2014will  not  be  possible \nwithout the active participation of the private sector. Continued budgetary pressures increasingly \nlead  DMCs  to  look  for  private  sector  investments  to  stimulate  growth  and  create  jobs.  Public \ninvolvement  in  the  productive  sectors  is  often  not  the  most  effective  use  of  scarce  funds, \nespecially if such use is at the expense of the social sectors where such funds are truly needed. \nPrivate  investment  and  management  in  properly  regulated  infrastructure  and  social  services \nprojects  can  relieve  pressure  on  public  budgets  and  enable  the  government  to  redirect  more \nresources to social spending. Consequently, governments need to shift away from playing the \nrole of an owner/producer and become a facilitator/regulator. \n \n4. \nADB is committed to expanding and expediting the role of the private sector through its \nPSD strategy adopted in 2000,4 and assists DMCs in building and reinforcing the confidence of \ninvestors  and  commercial  lenders.  Country  ownership  and  leadership  in  this  process  require \ncapacity  building  as  well  as  continued  dialogue  and  consultation  between  ADB  and  key \nstakeholders in and among the DMCs. ADB's LTSF states that ADB will help build the capacity \nof DMCs to design policies and reforms that create an effective enabling environment for PSD.  \n \n", "                                                \n1   ADB.  1999.
