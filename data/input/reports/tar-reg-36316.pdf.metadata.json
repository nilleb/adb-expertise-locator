Support for private sector development (PSD) is an integral part of the poverty reduction \nstrategy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and PSD as an engine of growth is a pillar of \nADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework (LTSF)2 for poverty reduction. As part of the Country \nStrategy and Program process, ADB is carrying out private sector assessments (PSAs) to \nidentify constraints to PSD and address them through operations in various sectors. In addition, \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) carry out PSD initiatives with assistance from other \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) and aid agencies. These PSD initiatives are often sector-\nspecific, lack horizontal integration, and are driven by sources rather than by the DMCs' own \nlong-term strategic vision or consideration of the overall picture of PSD.  \n \n2.  While  PSD  is  supported  by  ADB  and  other  IFI  and  aid  agency  initiatives,  DMC \nownership of a strategic and horizontally integrated PSD agenda will greatly enhance these \nexternal efforts. In addition, DMC-driven PSD strategies will make government PSD intentions \nmore  transparent  to  investors,  allow  for  better  IFI  and  aid  coordination,  and  provide  a \nbenchmark for monitoring progress on PSD over time and across countries. As an initial step in \ndeveloping country-driven PSD strategies and building on existing ADB PSD initiatives, this \nregional technical assistance (TA) will equip DMCs with increased understanding of approaches \nand steps for preparing a PSD strategy. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Mobilizing the enormous resources required to achieve the growth necessary for poverty \nreduction\u2014provision of infrastructure, social services, and employment\u2014will not be possible \nwithout the active participation of the private sector. Continued budgetary pressures increasingly \nlead DMCs to look for private sector investments to stimulate growth and create jobs. Public \ninvolvement in the productive sectors is often not the most effective use of scarce funds, \nespecially if such use is at the expense of the social sectors where such funds are truly needed. \nPrivate investment and management in properly regulated infrastructure and social services \nprojects can relieve pressure on public budgets and enable the government to redirect more \nresources to social spending. Consequently, governments need to shift away from playing the \nrole of an owner/producer and become a facilitator/regulator. \n \n4.  ADB is committed to expanding and expediting the role of the private sector through its \nPSD strategy adopted in 2000,4 and assists DMCs in building and reinforcing the confidence of \ninvestors and commercial lenders. Country ownership and leadership in this process require \ncapacity  building  as  well  as  continued  dialogue  and  consultation  between  ADB  and  key \nstakeholders in and among the DMCs. ADB's LTSF states that ADB will help build the capacity \nof DMCs to design policies and reforms that create an effective enabling environment for PSD.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development \nBank. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2001. Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2001-2015). Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 July 2002. \n4  ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. ", "2   \n \n5.  PSD policy statements in DMCs are general in nature. Because PSD initiatives from \ndifferent IFIs and aid agencies are predominantly sector-specific and anchored in Iine ministries \nresponsible for the sector, coordinating the initiatives is often suboptimal. Moreover, a number \nof PSD initiatives take place in an ad hoc manner when aid funds become available. The \npresent situation demonstrates the need for assistance to give direction to the development of \ncountry-driven PSD strategies. While toolkits have been developed for certain areas of PSD \n(e.g., WB Toolkit for Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure, MIGA Investment Promotion \nToolkit), no overall guidance is available for DMCs on how to take a coordinated sequenced \napproach to PSD. \n \n6.  Institutional capacity building and policy reform for PSD require a strategic approach. \nFollowing a request from their shareholders, IFIs have started to prepare investment climate \nstudies and private sector assessments and strategies. Even though these initiatives involve the \ngovernments of the DMCs, the IFIs appear to be really driving the process. According to ADB's \nMedium-Term Strategy,5 ADB must become more client focused. To play a key role in helping \ncreate  the  enabling  environment  so  that  the  private  sector  can  be  fully  involved  in  the \ndevelopment process ADB must support institutional capacity building and policy reform. \n    \n7.  ADB operates under the principle that DMCs must exercise leadership and ownership of \ntheir  own  development  agenda  and  priorities  by  demonstrating  initiative,  commitment,  and \naccountability. The TA will facilitate DMC ownership of the PSD agenda by providing guidance \non the concept and value of PSD strategies and a strategic approach to developing them. In \nformulating the PSD strategy framework, key factors to be considered in line with ADB's PSD \nstrategy include (i) ADB's overarching objective of poverty reduction, which DMCs have adopted \nthrough poverty partnership agreements; (ii) the development challenges facing the region; (iii) \nexperience and lessons learned from ADB's existing PSD operations in the participating DMCs; \nand (iv) PSD-related activities of other IFIs.  \n \n \n8.  The TA will be a collaborative effort and will be implemented in close consultation with \nstakeholders.  Dissemination  will  include  an  interregional  workshop  for  governments,  IFIs, \nbusiness organizations, and the private sector to facilitate dialogue and interregional exchange. \nregional departments of ADB will be closely involved. The TA will also recommend how existing \nalliances  and  interregional  networks  (e.g.,  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC) \nPrivatization Forum, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and other fora) can be \nutilized for continued exchange on the topic. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA will develop a coherent framework for the preparation of DMC-driven PSD \nstrategies  that  promote  the  development  of  a  strong  and  dynamic  private  sector  able  to \ncontribute  to  long-term  economic  growth  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  A  coherent \nframework means a logical guide that outlines strategic initiatives for PSD from the policy level \ndown. The framework will provide DMCs with a conceptual guidance for a strategic approach to \ngrowth-oriented, pro-poor PSD strategy development, and will highlight how to identify and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2001. Medium-Term Strategy (2001-2005), Manila. ", "  3 \n \nfocus on priority areas for PSD in an integrated manner. The goal is for DMCs to have an \nincreased understanding of how to formulate and integrate PSD strategies.  \n \n10.  The TA activities are targeted at senior government officials and policy makers. The \nactivities aim to increase awareness of the central role of the private sector in generating growth \nand of ways of improving the environment in which the private sector operates. The TA will \ndemonstrate that a PSD strategy complements other policy interventions and will elaborate PSD \nissues  and  synergies  in  DMCs  through  capacity  building,  collaboration,  and  interregional \nexchange. The TA will produce a framework report for the development of PSD strategies for \nDMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will comprise three activity clusters: (i) analysis of successes and failures of PSD \ninitiatives, (ii) framework development and capacity building, and (iii) promotion and knowledge \ndissemination. Activities will be carried out in consultation with governments, IFIs, other aid \nagencies, and the private sector. \n \n12.  Key activities under activity cluster (i) include research and analysis of PSD-related \ngovernment statements; successes and failures of key PSD initiatives undertaken, including \nsuccesses and failures with respect to phasing reforms in the participating DMCs as well as in \nother countries and regions of the world; and a background report on PSD research and \nanalysis for the participating DMCs. The consultants will write about the strategic PSD initiatives \nidentified under this cluster as theme papers for presentation at the interregional workshop. \nExamples of major themes include good practices for the reform of fixed property rights to \npromote land ownership and investment, reform of the collateral framework to promote financial \nmarket development, regulations to promote the private provision of infrastructure, creation of \nequal opportunities (e.g., in terms of taxation, trade or foreign exchange policy), prudential \nregulations,  business  registration  processes,  business  forums,  or  the  establishment  of \nregulatory bodies. Further theme papers will be prepared on strategic PSD initiatives in other \ncountries and regions, so that DMCs can benefit from the lessons learned and apply what is \nappropriate for their situation. The findings of the background report will be discussed with \nrepresentatives of the respective governments during in-country consultations. \n \n13.  Activity cluster (ii) will include identifying problems created and opportunities lost in the \nabsence of a coherent PSD strategy to facilitate an understanding and demonstrate the need for \na strategic approach to PSD, translating the analytical findings of the previous activity cluster \ninto  a  framework  to  support  DMCs'  reform  agendas  in  support  of  PSD,  developing  PSD \nmonitoring/benchmarking indicators, developing a scorecard for PSD, preparing a framework \nreport for developing PSD strategies, liaising with other IFIs and aid agencies on the tools \nprepared in this cluster, and providing capacity building on these tools. \n \n14.  Key activities of activity cluster (iii) include an interregional workshop for disseminating \nthe theme papers and the PSD strategy framework. Participants will be senior representatives \nfrom DMCs, IFIs, business organizations, and the private sector. To the extent possible, the TA \nwill attempt to use existing PSD-related networks to disseminate the TA results. The outputs will \nbe presented in the form of a publication. In addition, a CD Rom will be prepared and web \ncontent for ADB\u2019s web site will be developed for wider dissemination.  \n \n15.  The budget allows for up to five DMCs to participate in the TA. The selected countries \ninclude Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. One other DMC may be added at a later ", "4   \n \nstage, subject to the government's no objection. DMCs from all regions will be invited to the \ninterregional workshop. The selection criteria for participant countries include the expressed \ninterest  of  the  countries  to  participate  in  the  TA  and  to  reconsider  their  PSD  strategies \nthereafter, experience and lessons learned from existing PSD-related ADB operations,6 the \nexistence of replicable good-practice PSD initiatives, manageability due to size and central \nregime, and the fact that PSAs have been or are in the process of being carried out in all of \nthese  countries,  except  for  Thailand.  The  suggested  inclusion  of  Thailand  follows  the \nPresident's visit to the country, during which ADB support for PSD and private sector operations \nwas expressed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Governance  and  Regional \nCooperation Division (RSGR) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will be \nresponsible for all TA activities. RSGR staff will supervise TA implementation and participate in \ndiscussions with stakeholders. The PSD committee established under ADB's revised business \nprocesses will serve as the TA team for reviewing and commenting on consultant\u2019s deliverables. \nThe TA activities will be closely coordinated with relevant ongoing ADB activities as well as \nthose  of  other  IFIs  and  aid  agencies.  Each  participating  DMC  will  nominate  a  high-level \ncounterpart to be responsible for the TA (at least director level). The counterpart will guide the \nconsultants'  research,  facilitate  access  to  relevant  government  agencies  and  officials,  and \nprovide the necessary documents for the TA.  \n \n18.  Consulting services of 30.5 person-months (8.5 international, and 22 domestic) will be \nrequired. The consultant team hired through a firm will comprise three international consultants: \nPSD  specialist/team  leader,  development  economist,  and  legal/regulatory  expert,  with \nexperience in the region. The international consultants will be supported by one domestic \nconsultant per participant DMC. The domestic consultants will be experienced in PSD and will \nbe recruited to effectively interface with government counterparts. An editor and a domestic \nconsultant with experience in TA management and based in Manila will be recruited individually \nfor the study period. This consultant will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the \nTA, communication between the TA stakeholders, organizing the interregional workshop in \nManila, and coordinating the publication of the various outputs of the TA. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  Using the simplified format for technical proposals, ADB will engage the consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Given the complexity of the area of expertise, the specialization required, \nand the scarcity of expertise in the area of PSD policy in the market, as well as the fact that the \nsuccess  of  this  highly  visible  TA  is  crucially  dependent  on  recruiting  the  best  consultants \navailable in the area of PDS policy, the quality-based selection method will be applied in \nselecting the consulting firm.  \n                                                \n6  e.g. Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program; TA 3934-MON: Trade Policy Review; Loan VIE: Financial \nSector Program Loan (under processing); Loan 1800/1801-SRI: Private Sector Development Program Loan; Loan \n1894/1895-SRI: SME Sector Development Program; Loan 1729-PHI: LGU Infrastructure Development Facility. ", "  5 \n \n \n20.  The TA is expected to start in January 2003 and will be implemented over a period of 8 \nmonths. Implementation will involve an interregional workshop, planned after 6 months, to \ndiscuss the outputs of the TA. The main participants will comprise senior level government \nofficials and policy makers. Local workshops\u2014including capacity-building workshops on the \nstudy findings for relevant line ministries and other stakeholders in each DMC\u2014will be held \nduring TA implementation, as required. The consultants will submit an inception report 1 month \nafter the TA starts; an interim report after 3 months; a draft final report, including a draft \npublication, after 5.5 months; draft inclusions of the workshop proceedings 1 week after the \nworkshop;  a  final  Report  and  final  inclusions  of  the  workshop  proceedings  2  weeks  after \ncomments on the respective documents are received; and the final publication by the end of the \nTA period. \n \n \nIV.
