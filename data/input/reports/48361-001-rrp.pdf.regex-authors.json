THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Building  Macroeconomic  Resilience  Program,  and  (ii)  a \nproposed policy-based loan and grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for subprogram 1 of the Building \nMacroeconomic Resilience Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen Tonga\u2019s long-term growth prospects and capacity to \nrespond to external shocks. The programmatic approach, with three subprograms from 2016 to \n2018, builds on the previous policy-based operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other partners to sustain government efforts to improve (i) its fiscal position by adopting \nprudent policies and better public financial management (PFM); and (ii) the business climate by \ncontinuing policy, regulatory environment, and public enterprise reforms. The programmatic \napproach allows sequencing of reforms across a broad range of reform areas, accounting for \nthe limited implementation capacities of the small administration. Alongside ADB, the European \nUnion, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank are providing \nfinancing, and the International Monetary Fund has been part of the coordinated policy dialogue. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development  context.  Tonga  has  about  104,000  people  living  across  750  square \nkilometers  of  land  scattered  over  700,000  square  kilometers  of  the  South  Pacific  Ocean. \nTonga\u2019s economic growth in 2005\u20132014 has been low, highly volatile, and largely driven by the \npublic sector. Gross domestic product (GDP) only grew by an average 0.7% during the period.2 \nNatural  constraints  (remoteness,  smallness,  and  dispersion),  exposure  to  external  shocks \n(natural and economic), and internal bottlenecks (thin capacity, small and intertwined networks, \nand migration) have undermined Tonga\u2019s economy. Tonga has the second-highest disaster risk \nin  the  world. 3  Most  recently,  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston  caused  substantial  crop  and \ninfrastructure damage in the Vava\u2019u island group in February 2016, only 2 years after the \nHa\u2019apai island group was severely damaged by Cyclone Ian, mirroring a tendency toward more \nfrequent and intense extreme weather events across the South Pacific. \n \n4.  Political commitment to reforms. A period of political transition from 2005 to 2009, \nwhich included a push for more democratic participation and an attempt by the government to \nreform the civil service, led to internal tensions and civil unrest. The resulting reconstruction \nneeds and public wage bill spending strained the country\u2019s fiscal and debt positions, leaving \nTonga in high risk of debt distress. Subsequent governments have worked to improve the \nsituation by maintaining prudent fiscal and debt policies and reforming public enterprises and \nthe business environment in order to increase private sector activity. These efforts improved \nTonga\u2019s debt distress risk rating to moderate in 2013 and lifted Tonga into a leading position \namong  Pacific  countries,  with  high  country  performance  assessment  and  ease  of  doing \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Reliance on external assistance. Tonga relies heavily on external support. In FY2016, \ncash and in-kind aid are expected to account for 54.8% of total revenue and grants, and \nremittances are projected to be 29.8% of GDP. While these inflows support the country\u2019s \nperformance, they also create dependencies. If these inflows abate, as seen in the aftermath of \nthe  2007\u20132008  food  and  fuel  and  global  financial  crises,  sustainable  service  delivery, \nlivelihoods, and human development could be at risk. This shows the urgent need to build \nmacroeconomic  resilience.  The  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  identifying  and \nimplementing  critical  reforms  that  leverage  public  resources\u2014via  domestic  resource \nmobilization, better resource allocation, and more efficient spending\u2014and private financing to \nreduce external dependencies and improve future growth prospects. Policy-based operations \nplay an important role in supporting the government. \n \n6.  Government reforms. In 2009, the government embarked on an ambitious multiyear, \nmultisector reform program, focusing on both the public and private sectors. These reforms \nstrengthened domestic resource mobilization, debt management, public wage bill management, \nPFM, the business regulatory framework (receivership and business registration), public service \nprovision (electricity tariff reform and improved governance of public utility providers), and public \nenterprise portfolio management.7 Limited government capacity in each area requires spreading \nreform efforts across several government ministries, as well as prioritizing and sequencing \nreforms  over  several  years.  Despite  thin  policy-making  and  administrative  capacity  and  a \npolitical economy environment with small, intertwined political and social networks that pose \ninherent risks to reform implementation, substantial progress has been made and successive \ngovernments have shown persistence.  \n \n7.  Volatile external environment and persistent fiscal deficit. Benefiting from a positive \nexternal environment, including low global commodity prices, Tonga\u2019s macroeconomic position \nimproved in FY2015. This contributed to low inflation and a narrowing current account deficit, \nexpected at 1.9% of GDP in FY2016, despite increasing imports for investments in the 2019 \nSouth Pacific Games facilities, tourism, and government infrastructure. The outlook for Tonga is \npositive as expanding construction, agricultural production, and tourism are expected to uphold \ngrowth at 2.8% in FY2016 and 2.7% in FY2017 (Table 1). Despite these positive external and \ndomestic  developments,  Tonga\u2019s  fiscal  position  remains  strained:  fiscal  deficits  (excluding \ngrants) averaged 9.2% of GDP in FY2011\u2013FY2015,8 putting substantial pressure on continuous \n                                                \n4  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2013.

Drastic cuts in capital and recurrent \nspending would be needed if aid flows abate. With public debt estimated at 51.3% of GDP in \nFY2015,  Tonga  is  at  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress  and  has  limited  capacity  for  further \nborrowing.

Tax increases on unhealthy food items and beverages, improvements in tax compliance, \nand  reduced  exemptions  helped  raise  tax  revenue  from  an  average  of  16.5%  of  GDP  in \nFY2010\u20132012  to  17.8%  in  FY2013\u2013FY2015.  This  trend  is  expected  to  continue  over  the \nmedium term provided that reforms continue to be implemented. On the expenditure side, the \nlarge public sector wage bill has gradually increased from 11.4% of GDP in FY2012 to an \nexpected 13.8% in FY2016, which risks crowding out spending on operations and maintenance \nand capital outlays, and could undermine implementation of policy priorities under the national \ndevelopment plan. The government has made continuous progress in strengthening Tonga\u2019s \nPFM systems and capacity, e.g., in planning, budgeting, and procurement, which is reflected in \ngradually higher public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment ratings.9 \nWeaknesses in procurement, financial management, and audit continue to pose some fiduciary \nrisk,  and  thin  public  sector  capacity  poses  a  lasting  threat  to  maintaining  and  advancing \nachieved functionality. This also threatens effective service regulation, which is important in a \nsmall market like Tonga, where limited scope for competition can result in inflated consumer \n                                                \n9  Government of Tonga. 2007.

Supporting the private sector and diversifying economic growth. Tonga is the best \nperforming Pacific country in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business ranking, but its private sector is \nconstrained by high cost structures, a small market, and the outward migration of limited skilled \nlabor. In  2009, Tonga embarked  on  business environment reforms that  have  since  led to \nsubstantial improvements to business licensing and secured transaction frameworks, which help \nminimize transaction costs for businesses and improve access to finance.10 However, progress \nhas  been  slow  on  the  business  law  side\u2014the  implementation  of  legal  frameworks  for \nbankruptcy, foreign investment, and contracting is still incomplete\u2014because of extensive reform \nconsultation needs and limited government capacity and technical assistance (TA) support. With \nthe credit bureau inactive, reliable credit information is missing, which drives up the costs of \nextending credit to new customers. \n \n10.  Improving  the  productivity  of  public  enterprises. After implementing a series of \nreforms focused on strengthening the governance framework of public enterprises, liquidating \ninsolvent public enterprises, and increasing private sector participation in public enterprises in \n2009\u20132015, Tonga\u2019s public enterprise portfolio became one of the Pacific\u2019s best performers.11  \nHowever, fiscal costs and risks can still be reduced substantially, and public enterprises can \ncontribute more to GDP. For example, public enterprises account for 16% of total fixed assets in \nthe economy but contributed only about 6% to GDP in FY2014. Public enterprises in competitive \nsectors such as telecommunications continue to face stiff competition, which can pose a risk to \npublic asset values in the medium term. Portfolio performance can be further improved through \nreforms to the governance and ownership structures of individual public enterprises, and service \ndelivery arrangements that make use of private sector efficiencies.  \n \n11.  Continued reform. The reform momentum must be sustained for Tonga to face its \ndiverse challenges and allow fiscal and structural change to take root. The fiscal position must \nbe made more sustainable through continued revenue and wage bill reform and prudent debt \nmanagement. More efficient and effective PFM systems to make the best use of limited public \nresources\u2014and reforms to strengthen competition policy, service, and labor market regulation\u2014\nare vital to establish an inclusive, modern, and accountable state. Lastly, continual reform \nefforts to improve the business regulatory framework in order to attract foreign and domestic \ninvestment, improve financial sector functioning, and reduce the risk from ambiguous legal \nframeworks are essential to establish a more dynamic and inclusive economy, with increased \nprivate sector contribution to job creation, growth, and development.  \n \n12.  Partner support. Development partners have been supporting the government along its \nreform path with policy advice, TA, and budget financing. Since 2011, reforms have been \nprioritized  and  sequenced  through  the  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM)  process\u2014widely \nconsidered international good practice. This process regularly brings together key ministries and \ndevelopment partners to map out critical constraints, design policy and TA solutions, monitor \ntheir implementation, and provide budget financing. By strengthening country systems and \nfacilitating partner harmonization and alignment, the JPRM increases aid effectiveness. The \nJPRM  prioritizes  public  and  private  sector  reforms  under  the  government\u2019s  multiyear, \n                                                \n10 IMF. 2015.

The International Monetary \nFund has also been part of the coordinated policy dialogue under the JPRM. Jointly with the \nWorld Bank, ADB has been a lead partner in advancing JPRM discussions and is absorbing \nsubstantial reform coordination and transaction costs to avoid overburdening the small public \nadministration and decision makers. \n \n13.  ADB priorities and contributions. ADB\u2019s sector priorities in Tonga are public sector \nmanagement  (including  PFM  and  private  sector  development),  energy,  information  and \ncommunication technology, and urban services (water, sanitation, and waste). ADB provides a \ncombination of investment projects, TA, and policy-based programs to maximize development \nimpact in these sectors. Within the JPRM process, ADB has provided budget support\u2014some \nyears jointly with other partners, some years alternating\u2014to address development financing \nneeds, cover the cost of reforms, and incentivize reform implementation. ADB is the leading TA \nprovider in utility regulation, private sector development strategy preparation, business law and \nforeign  investment  framework  reform,  and  public  enterprise  reform.  It  also  contributes \nsubstantially to fiscal strategy preparation, financial sector development, and reforms of the civil \nservice,  PFM  systems,  the  labor  market,  and  the  energy  sector.12 The  reform  outcomes \nsupported through TA and under the program, including improved governance and efficiency of \npublic  enterprises,  better  service  regulation,  and  improved  public  procurement  and  audit \nfunctionality, in turn positively impact and directly complement ADB\u2019s sector investments. \n \n14.  Programmatic  approach.  The  proposed  programmatic  approach  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  building  on  two  programs  in  2009  and  2013.  The  three \nsubprograms in 2016\u20132018 allow for reform sequencing while providing flexibility to respond to \nemerging opportunities and constraints.13 The programmatic approach is fully integrated with \nthe  JPRM  dialogue  and  aligned  with  policy-based  operations  by  the  European  Union, the \nGovernments of Australia and New Zealand, and World Bank.14 The International Monetary \nFund has been involved in the JPRM dialogue, although is not providing funding. The program \nincorporates past lessons to build a strong political reform consensus, limit reform to a few \nmajor  actions,  institutionalize  a  government\u2013partner  coordination  mechanism,  and  adopt  a \nmedium-term view for institutional and structural change to take root. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The program is fully aligned with the Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u2013\n2025 and its impacts (or national outcomes) of (i) more inclusive and sustainable growth and \ndevelopment; (ii) a more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy; and \n(iii) more responsive good governance (footnote 5). The outcome will be an improved fiscal \nposition and business environment in Tonga. \n \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2013.

Outputs \n16.  The program has four outputs. The first three outputs are fully aligned with the JPRM \nand continue the government\u2019s reform efforts supported by ADB and other partners since \n2009.15 The fourth output reflects a response to damage caused by Tropical Cyclone Winston \non the Vava\u2019u island group in February 2016, which increased financing needs in FY2016. All \n10 prior actions under subprogram 1 have been completed. Subprogram 2 has 10 tentative \npolicy actions; subprogram 3 has 13.  \n \n17.  Output 1: Fiscal resilience supported. This output aims to increase Tonga\u2019s fiscal \nresilience by updating the fiscal framework, generating more domestic revenue, stabilizing the \npublic wage bill, and ensuring prudent debt management. Subprogram 1 continued tax regime \nchanges related to health and environment through increases in selected excise and import duty \nrates (on fuel, alcohol, tobacco, and processed food items). It also supported the development, \napproval, and publishing of a new medium-term debt strategy for FY2016\u2013FY2019, as well as \ncabinet approval of remuneration review recommendations as a first step in the government\u2019s \ncomprehensive civil service reform program. Subprograms 2 and 3 continue tax reforms with \nthe implementation of consumption and corporate tax review recommendations, as well as the \ncivil service reform program. Subprogram 2 introduces a new relative salary structure in FY2017 \nthat  provides  for  fair  remuneration,  while  subprogram  3  introduces  a  basic  performance \nmanagement framework. Together, these reforms will form an effective management instrument \nfor government, help meet sustainable wage bill targets preset in the fiscal framework that is \nrecalibrated under subprogram 2, and lay the foundation for a performance-based civil service \nculture.  The  stabilized  wage  bill  will  become  more  affordable  through  increases  in  tax \ncollections, which will gradually free up resources for discretionary spending on infrastructure \nand social programs. \n \n18.  Output  2:  An  inclusive,  modern,  and  accountable  state  supported. This output \ngroups reforms in procurement, PFM, and regulation of utilities, services, and the labor market, \nwhich share the goals of promoting good governance and public sector functioning. Subprogram \n1 continued past efforts to establish a centralized procurement system and introduced a revised \nset of procurement regulations, standard bidding documents, and a procurement manual. It also \nestablished  the  Audit Oversight  Committee  of  the  Cabinet  to support  timely  and  thorough \nimplementation of audit recommendations. Subprogram 1 also supported new communication \nand communication commission bills that establish an independent regulator with powers to \nregulate communication services, as well as issue licenses and set fees. Subprograms 2 and 3 \nsupport  the  development  and  approval  of  a  government  accounting  policy  and  a  chart  of \naccounts revision, as well as improved functionality of the financial management information \nsystem (commitment control, financial reporting, budget preparation, sales and receipts, and \ncash management). Subprogram 2 also supports the development and approval of a policy \nframework and action plan to strengthen institutional arrangements and capacity for service \nregulation across multiple sectors. Subprogram 3 supports the implementation of the action plan \nand the approval of a competition policy that is currently lacking. Lastly, subprogram 3 supports \nthe approval of an employment relations bill, which aims to improve labor market functioning \nwhile safeguarding employee rights and reducing gender disparities. \n \n19.  Output 3: A more dynamic and inclusive economy supported. This output covers \nreforms to establish a supportive environment for private sector development and to improve \n                                                \n15 Overview  of  Past  and  Planned  Policy  Reform  Actions,  2009\u20132018  provides  detailed  information  on \nJPRM-supported reforms since 2009 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nproductivity of public enterprises, with the aim of boosting inclusive growth. Subprogram 2 \nsupports the approval  of a private sector development strategy to guide reforms over the \nmedium-term. To increase access and affordability of finance, subprograms 2 and 3 support \nbetter credit information by mandating credit reporting to ensure universal use of the credit \nbureau and extending credit bureau coverage to nonbank credit providers such as utilities. \nSubprograms 2 and 3 also support (i) the approval of new foreign investment legislation and \nrevised foreign investment regulations (including reserved and restricted lists, and work permit \nrules);  and  (ii)  a  bankruptcy  policy  and  legislation  to  complete  the  insolvency  framework. \nSubprogram 3 supports the approval of a contracting policy framework and the implementation \nof an entity structure that facilitates formalization of businesses. Subprogram 1 supported the \ndevelopment of a new policy and reform plan for public enterprise ownership, performance \nimprovement, and divestment as a framework for continued reform. Initial implementation steps \nincluded the establishment of shared boards of directors for all public enterprises in a sector and \nthe  conclusion  of  a  contract  between  the  Tonga  Water  Board  and  a  private  business  to \noutsource asset maintenance and pipe-laying services. Subprograms 2 and 3 each support the \nreform of at least two public enterprises in accordance with the new public enterprise policy. TA \nhelps to identify reform candidates and the most suitable reform paths (e.g., privatization, \noutsourcing of activities, or restructuring).  \n \n20.  Output 4: Effective response to disasters supported. Subprogram 1 supported the \ndevelopment  and  approval  of  a  costed  response  plan,  based  on  a  post-disaster  needs \nassessment, to guide an effective and efficient response to damage caused by Tropical Cyclone \nWinston. The response plan aims to alleviate the hardship and secure the livelihoods of the \naffected populations in the Vava\u2019u island group, as well as increase future disaster resilience by \nbuilding back better. Financing of $1.0 million from ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility, funded by \nthe Asian Development Fund, is provided under subprogram 1 to implement the response plan, \nparticularly to address damage in the agriculture sector and rehabilitate infrastructure in Vava\u2019u. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n21.  Table  1  provides  an  overview  of  development  financing  needs  over  the  expected \nduration of the programmatic approach in FY2016\u2013FY2018. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) \nin FY2016 is estimated at $27.8 million (6.7% of GDP). Grants are expected to amount to \n$18.2 million, of which $9.8 million is in the form of confirmed budget support ($3.0 million from \nADB plus $2.8 million from the European Union, $3.0 million from the Government of Australia, \nand $1.0 million from the World Bank\u2014all of which are parallel cofinancing not administered by \nADB), leaving an overall deficit of $9.5 million (2.3% of GDP). In FY2016, budget support loans \nare expected to amount to $4.0 million ($3.0 million from ADB and $1.0 million from the World \nBank), with the remaining gap filled by concessional project loans and issuance of domestic \nbonds (Table 1). In FY2017 and FY2018, fiscal deficits (excluding grants) of $28.1 million and \n$24.8 million are expected to be covered by $21.7 million and $18.7 million in grants (of which \n$9.3 million is in the form of budget support, including $2.5 million from ADB each year), \n$3.5 million in budget support loans, including $2.5 million from ADB each year, and some \nexternal project financing (and domestic borrowing in FY2017). \n \n22.  The program is expected to contribute to increased tax revenue from an annual average \nof 17.4% of GDP in FY2011\u2013FY2015 to at least 21.4% of GDP from FY2017 onward. As \noutlined in the development policy letter, the government\u2019s development expenditure program \nincludes increased allocations to social sectors and for the maintenance of infrastructure, as \nwell as an allocation to cover costs resulting from the introduction of a new salary structure as \npart of the civil service reform. Further financing needs stem from the government\u2019s response to \n ", "8 \nTropical  Cyclone  Winston,  particularly  to  address  damage  in  the  agriculture  sector  and \nrehabilitate infrastructure in Vava\u2019u (Appendix 3).16 \n \n23.  In line with financing needs, the government requested a single-tranche loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,125,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (including \n$500,000  equivalent  allocated  from  the  Disaster  Response  Facility  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund) to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing \nagreement. The government also requested a single-tranche grant17 of $3.0 million from the \nAsian Development Fund (including $500,000 from the Disaster Response Facility) to help \nfinance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports.18 The loan and grant proceeds will be \nwithdrawn, upon effectiveness, in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplified procedure for disbursement \nof program loans.19 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) is the executing agency. The \nministries  of  public  enterprises,  commerce  and  labor,  revenue  and  customs  services,  and \nmeteorology, energy, information, disaster management, climate change and communications; \nand  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  Budget  Support \nManagement Committee, which leads the JPRM process, oversees program implementation \nand monitoring. It is chaired by MFNP\u2019s chief executive officer and comprises all implementing \nagencies and major development partners, including ADB. Subprogram 1 is implemented from \nOctober 2014 to June 2016. Implementation of subprogram 2 is tentatively scheduled from July \n2016  to  June  2017  and  subprogram  3  is  from  July  2017  to  June  2018,  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s budget cycle. The policy matrix (Appendix 4) indicates the program framework, \nincluding the policy actions completed before Board consideration for subprogram 1, and those \nindicatively proposed for subprograms 2 and 3. Subprograms 2 and 3 will be submitted for \nBoard consideration upon completion of the respective indicative actions. The JPRM process \nfacilitates broad consultations on reform priorities, with the cabinet providing strategic guidance. \nIndividual reform initiatives form part of existing sector strategies and are being discussed with \nprivate sector and civil society groups during program preparation and implementation. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n25.  Economic and financial. Envisaged reform impacts include allocative efficiency gains \nfrom the rebalancing of expenditure from wage bill and debt servicing to priority areas, including \noperations and maintenance. Increases in domestic revenue and higher returns (or less drain) \nfrom more efficient public enterprises will gradually reduce future development financing needs. \nIncreased  macroeconomic  resilience  will  reduce  the  negative  impacts  of  external  shocks, \n                                                \n16 Tropical Cyclone Winston Response Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Loan and \ngrant financing from ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility is earmarked to implement the response plan. \n17 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Tonga had a moderate risk of debt distress and was \ntherefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n18 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 1998.

Strengthened utility and service regulation is expected to improve \naccess to and the quality and cost of services\u2014benefiting households and businesses. \n \n26.  Governance. Promoting good governance is a key priority of the new government. The \ngovernment is implementing its PFM reform road map, FY2015\u2013FY2019, which aims to close \ngaps  identified  in  an  external  PEFA  assessment  in  2010  and  a  self-assessment  in  2014 \n(footnote  9).  Despite  capacity  limitations  stemming  largely  from  Tonga\u2019s  smallness,  PEFA \nratings have gradually improved. The government is assessed to have the ability to implement \nits budget, which is integral to the program\u2019s success. Remaining weaknesses in procurement, \naccounting,  financial  reporting,  and  audit  are  addressed  by  the  program\u2019s  policy  actions, \ncomplemented by development partner TA. Tonga has taken steps to strengthen anticorruption \nmeasures, including the creation of a Parliament Standing Committee on Anti-Corruption in \n2015, and is seeking to appoint the first anticorruption commissioner.21 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n27.  Poverty and social. The program will assist the government in building macroeconomic \nresilience, improving public service delivery, and promoting inclusive growth. A more resilient \nmacroeconomic and fiscal position will reduce the impact of external shocks and allow the \ngovernment to respond effectively while maintaining basic social services. Fair and efficient \ndomestic revenue mobilization will increase funding and strengthen accountability relationships \nbetween  taxpayers  and  the  government,  which  are  both  essential  for  sustainable  service \ndelivery. Better prioritized and more efficiently executed public spending will have a positive \nimpact on service delivery in the medium term. Service regulation is expected to have positive \nimpacts on service access, quality, and costs. Private sector development is expected to create \njobs\u2014an important way to address income poverty in Tonga. While subprogram 1 is classified \nas having no gender elements, positive poverty and social impacts through better and more \nsustainable services and private sector job creation will benefit women equally.22 \n \n28.  Safeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram \n1 is classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the activities \nwill result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, nor will they negatively affect indigenous people \nor the environment. Regular and close dialogue with stakeholders is carried out during program \ndesign and reform implementation. \n \n29.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 PFM \nsystems are assessed as strong and able to support mostly reliable services. The remaining \nfiduciary risks will be addressed through policy reforms and TA support. Integrated benefits and \nimpacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n20  Macroeconomic resilience comprises fiscal health (i.e., manageable fiscal deficits and public debt levels), adequate \npublic financial management systems and regulation for efficient and effective service delivery, sufficient cash and \nforeign reserves to respond to external shocks, and a growing and gradually more diversified economic base.  \n21 The Joint Policy Reform Matrix, 2015/16\u20132017/18 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \nincludes the appointment of an anticorruption commissioner to boost the government\u2019s anticorruption efforts. \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nWomen\u2019s labor market access and rights, as well as transitioning women-run businesses into the formal sector, will \nbe directly targeted under subsequent subprograms. \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
