Road  improvement  works  under  the  Project \ninclude upgrading of existing roads to two lanes, strengthening \nculverts  and  bridges,  constructing  new  bridges  and  cross-\ndrainage structures, and constructing structures for resettlement \nand rehabilitation.   \n \nThe Project will enhance overall sector management capacity by \nproviding (i) equipment necessary for the government of Bihar \n(GOB) to enhance sector capacity in areas such as quality control, \nsurvey and design, road safety, and control of overloading and \nvehicle emissions; and (ii) technical assistance (TA) to support \ninstitutional development initiatives of GOB, especially for reform \nof  the  Road  Construction  Department  (RCD)  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  including  (a)  modernization  of  road  institutions, \n(b) improvements to RCD business processes, and (c) support for \nincreasing private sector participation. \n   \nRationale  The road network in Bihar is very poor in terms of coverage and \nconditions  while  demand  for  road  transport  is  increasing. \nInsufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  increased  the \nnumber of roads that are beyond maintainable condition, and the \nbacklog of deferred maintenance. GOB is undertaking the State \nHighway Development Program to rehabilitate and upgrade state \nhighways to at least two lanes and expand the state highway \nnetwork  by  upgrading  major  district  roads  to  two  lanes.  The \nimprovement of 820 km of state highways is part of a series of the \nprogram to help meet increased demands for road transport, and \naccelerate the process of economic development in the state. \n ", "ii   \n  RCD, in charge of overall sector development and management, \nlacks  modern  project  management  and  procurement  systems. \nThis often leads to cost and time overruns in project delivery. For \nefficient and effective road asset development and management, \nRCD needs to be modernized by (i) harnessing private sector \nstructures and skills to meet the public demand for infrastructure; \n(ii) encouraging private sector participation in road financing; and \n(iii)  outsourcing  functions  of  project  preparation,  design, \nconstruction, construction supervision, and quality audit to private \nentities. Improvements to road safety and control of overloading \nand vehicle emissions are also required for the safe and efficient \nuse of road assets with minimal adverse environmental impacts. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road \nnetwork,  which  will  contribute  to  expansion  of  economic \nopportunities  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be  realized  by \n(i) improving the state highway network, (ii) facilitating safe and \nappropriate  road  usage,  (iii)  increasing  efficiency  of  transport \nservices,  and  (iv)  enhancing  GOB  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management.  Improved  roads  will  improve \naccessibility  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  enhance  the \nefficiency of road transport usage. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $468 million, \nincluding taxes and duties.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $420,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of India (the Government) will provide the loan \nTerms  proceeds  in  local  currency  to  GOB  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  received  from  ADB.  GOB  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk on the loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 July 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 January 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  GOB through RCD \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  The project management unit, headed by the chief engineer at \nArrangements  RCD  headquarters,  will  implement  the  Project.  Project \nimplementation units, each headed by a project manager, have \nbeen established and will be responsible for implementation in the \nfield. One or two full-time project managers will be assigned for \neach contract package. The project managers will be delegated \nadequate  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious \nproject implementation. RCD will engage construction supervision \nconsultants to act as the engineer for the construction contracts. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Project  will  provide  $4  million  for \nequipment  to  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if the estimated contract is valued from $0.1 million to \n$1 million, and shopping if the estimated contract amount is less \nthan $0.1 million. \n   \nConsulting Services  Two international consulting firms will be recruited for construction \nsupervision of civil works under the Project. RCD will select and \nengage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAbout 68 person-months of international consultants and 3,020 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Improving management of the state highway network through the \nBeneficiaries  institutional  development  component  and  the  TA,  and  the \nimprovement to the road network under the Project will enhance \nthe overall road condition and usability of state trunk roads. This \nwill increase travel speeds, and reducing travel time, accidents, \noverloading,  and  vehicle  emissions.  The  Project  will  enhance \nRCD capacity for road asset development and management. This \nwill improve governance in road administration and accountability, \nand  create  an  environment  encouraging  competition  and \nefficiency  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry.  This  will \nensure more efficient road asset development and management, \nand higher quality of construction and maintenance, resulting in \ndecreased recurrent costs over the medium and long term. These \nwill lead to overall social and economic development in Bihar. \n \n  Poverty is high in Bihar, among the highest of all India\u2019s states. \nThe  Project  will  improve  access  to  socioeconomic  services, \nincrease  employment  opportunities,  and  improve  transport \nservices. This will reduce poverty in the region, and stimulate \neconomic growth and human development in the state. Improved \nmobility will provide households with better-paying jobs outside of \ntheir villages.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  risk  of  initial  delays  has  been  mitigated  through  advance \nactions  by  RCD  and  support  provided  by  ADB.  Training  on \nsafeguard and procurement requirements was provided to RCD \nstaff to mitigate potential risk of initial delays due to procedural \nclearance.  ADB  has  provided  support  to  due  diligence  for  all \nproject roads. \n \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated \nby  reflecting  the  context  of  the  state  in  the  institutional \nstrengthening action plan. The plan considers the rather short-\nterm  project  duration,  actions  taken  by  GOB,  Planning \nCommission  recommendations,  and  recent  development  policy \nloan approved by the World Bank.  \n \nThe  risk  of  maintenance  financing  will  be  mitigated  by  GOB \ninitiatives  to  implement  road  asset  management  systems  for \nbetter  planning  and  budgeting.  GOB  has  increased  its \nmaintenance  budget  to  substantially  meet  requirements  and \nobtained  the  full  Government  grant-in-aide  under  the \n12th Finance Commission. RCD\u2019s strict monitoring systems for \nproject  implementation  minimize  the  risk  of  underutilizing  the \nmaintenance budget. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, a TA will be provided to support \nGOB sector development initiatives. RCD will be developed into a \nstate-of-the-art road agency equipped with modern systems of \nbusiness  procedures,  planning  processes,  quality  assurance, \nengineering  (pavement  design,  maintenance  methods,  and \nsafety), and human resource management. The estimated total \ncost  of  the  TA  is  $1,250,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance \n$1,000,000 on a grant basis from the ADB TA funding program. \nThe TA consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \n \n ", " \n \nv", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Bihar State Highways Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of the Bihar Road Sector, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Bihar, a landlocked state lying in the middle Gangetic region, has an area of 94,164 \nsquare kilometers. It is surrounded by Uttar Pradesh (west), Jharkhand (south), West Bengal \n(east), and Nepal (north). The state has a rich history and cultural tradition, making it a major \nreligious and tourist destination. While it has an extensive and well-developed rail system, and \nconsiderable potential for developing and utilizing inland waterways, rapid development and \nstrengthening  of  the  road  network  will  provide  momentum  for  accelerating  economic \ndevelopment in the state, enabling Bihar to move from being dependent on subsistence farming \nto focusing on market-oriented agriculture and tourism. Since Bihar is the third most populous, \npoorest, and slowest-growing state in fast-growing India, development of the state is key to the \ncountry\u2019s goal of regionally balanced growth. \n \n3.  Bihar has 82,000 kilometers (km) of roads; 45,000 km are surfaced. It has 3,723 km of \nnational highways, 3,128 km of state highways, 7,714 km of major district roads (MDRs), and \n67,080 km of other district roads (ODRs) and village roads. The road density is 901 km per \nmillion population compared with the national average of 2,567 km. Almost all of the higher \nclass of roads (national highways, state highways, and MDRs) are provided with a sealed \n(bitumen or concrete) surface, while 55% of ODRs and village roads remain unsealed. Only 2% \nof state highways have two or more lanes; 71% are single lane. For MDRs, 83% are single lane. \nAll ODRs and village roads are single lane. The majority of state highways, MDRs, ODRs, and \nvillage roads are assessed to have deteriorated severely and require major rehabilitation largely \nbecause of the continuous short fall in investment for road maintenance until recently, and \nincreasing volume of traffic and loads. The need to increase and improve the existing state \nhighway network is critical. This can be accomplished by widening existing carriageways, and \nstrengthening and constructing or reconstructing bridges and culverts. \n \n4.  Bihar Road Construction Department (RCD) is responsible for state highways, MDRs, \nand national highways approved and funded by the Government of India (the Government). Of \nthe  3,700  km  of  national  highways  in  Bihar,  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  is \nresponsible for 800 km. The Government recently approved upgrading 890 km of national \nhighways  to  four  lanes  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  III  using  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT).  Roads  that  GOB  identifies  for  development  on  a  BOT  basis  are \nentrusted to India Infrastructure Finance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance \nCompany  to  structure  and  implement  the  projects.  District  councils  and  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  ODRs  and  village  roads.  The  Rural  Works  Department  is \nresponsible for the chief minister\u2019s rural roads program, Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \n(MMGSY),  which  connects  habitations  with  populations  of  500\u2013999,  in  parallel  with  the \nnationwide  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY), which gives priority to connectivity for habitations with populations of more than \n1,000. The chief minister\u2019s rural roads program follows the basic principles and incorporates the ", " 2   \ngood practices of the Prime Minister\u2019s rural roads program, but employs more decentralized \nadministrative and technical sanction procedures, and utilizes a separate set of guidelines for \nproject selection.  \n \n5.  Budgetary expenditure for state roads in 2006/07 was Rs1,974 crore1 ($506 million) \nagainst an original budget of Rs2,147 crore ($551 million). In 2006/07, the budget was 2.8 times \nas large as the previous year\u2019s Rs648 crore ($171 million) due to the new state government\u2019s \npriority  for  road  rehabilitation  and  development,  supported  by  the  Government\u2019s  Backward \nRegion Grant Fund (Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana or RSVY). The extent of underspending was \nonly 8% of the original budget. This demonstrates remarkable improvement in RCD capacity \nand commitment to deliver. The 2007/08 budget has gone up further to Rs2,379 crore ($610 \nmillion). \n \n6.  Revenues relating to road use include vehicle taxes, permits, fees, and penalties and \nwere Rs308 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, up from Rs178 crore ($87 million) in 2002/03. The \naverage annual increase is very high at 20% due to improved vehicle registration and tax \npayment. In addition, road users pay commercial sales taxes for such items as vehicles, fuel, \ntires,  and  spare  parts.  The  Bihar  Transport  Department  is  a  major  resource-generating \ndepartment, along with the commercial tax, registration, and excise departments. \n \n7.  The Transport Department is responsible for licensing, registration, and regulation of \nmotor  vehicles,  drivers,  and  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Motor  vehicle  registration \nincreased from 0.95 million in 2000/01 to 1.56 million in 2006/07, an annual average of 8.6%. \nThe highest increase was for two-wheelers; when they are excluded, registration increased by \n5.5%. Of the 1.56 million motor vehicles registered, 68% were two-wheelers. Excluding two \nwheelers,  registered  vehicles  comprise  cars  and  jeeps  (31%),  trucks  (10%),  buses  and \nminibuses (3%), and  tractors and trailers (43%). \n \n8.  The state-owned Bihar State Road Transport Corporation provides intra- and interstate \nbus services. It currently operates 2%\u20133% of buses in the state, and is authorized by GOB to fix \nits fares based on sound business principles. GOB grants permission for contract and private \nbuses also on the same routes of the State Road Transport Corporation. Private bus operators \nadopt fares based on demand for specific routes. Truck hire rates are fixed by market demand. \nPrivate  sector  operators  provide  most  of  the  services  for  passenger  and  freight  transport. \nCompetition is good. \n \n9.  The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 \nprovides details of the road sector in Bihar.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n10.  The state\u2019s road network is very poor in terms of coverage and conditions. Demand for \nroad transport is increasing. Insufficient funding to road maintenance in the past has increased \nthe  number  of  roads  that  are  beyond  maintainable  condition  and  the  backlog  of  deferred \nmaintenance. GOB has taken on the State Highway Development Program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade state highways to at least 2 lanes, and expand the state highway network by upgrading \nMDRs to 2 lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km of the 3,127 km of state highways \n                                                 \n1 A crore is equal to 10,000,000. \n ", "    3\nduring the 11th Five Year Plan period through various schemes, including the Government-\nsupported RSVY, BOT schemes, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. \n \n11.  GOB also takes on sector development initiatives in the framework specified in Bihar \nRoad  Sector  Development\u2013New  Dimensions2 to  develop  and  sustain  the  road  network  by \nmodernizing  road  agencies;  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing; \noutsourcing design, supervision, and construction along with systems for independent proof \nchecking  and  audit;  setting  up  a  stable  source  of  funding  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance;  attracting  financially  sound  and  fully  equipped  contractors  by  offering  large \ncontracts  for  national  and  state  highway  projects;  enabling  smaller  contractors  to  acquire \nexperience; introducing long-term, performance-based maintenance contracts; initiating corridor \nmanagement to expedite clearance of utilities and availability of materials; and strengthening \ncapacity of local contractors. \n \na.  Reform and Capacity Building in Road Sector Management \n \n12.  Approaches identified by the Bihar road sector development strategy (footnote 2) include \n(i) harnessing private sector structures and skills to meet public demand for infrastructure;  \n(ii) encouraging private sector participation in road financing; and (iii) outsourcing functions of \nproject preparation, design, construction, construction supervision, and quality audit to private \nentities. This would leave government functionaries with the limited but important responsibility \nof policy development and management oversight, and improving accountability concentrating \non performance monitoring and output, rather than the day-to-day running of public services. \n \n13.  For this purpose, RCD initially outsourced works of upgrading old state highways under \nRSVY with Rs3,000 crores ($790 million) to other road implementation agencies, targeting \ncompletion by 2008/09. Work on the remaining 1,554 km, of newly declared state highways, is \nproposed to be implemented with international best practices with ADB financing, adopting \nFIDIC3-based contract management and international competitive bidding procedures. GOB has \nbeen discussing potential BOT projects for 500 km of national highways with India Infrastructure \nFinance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance Company. \n \n14.  RCD is considering setting up a state roads and highways development authority or \ncorporation to streamline decision making and increase autonomy for project execution and \ndelivery. This requires redefinition of powers, functions, and accountability of road agencies; \nand changes to existing business procedures. Major actions taken by RCD so far include \nstreamlining bidding procedures, quality control, asset management, and project management \nand monitoring. RCD\u2019s sector management capability, which was significantly strengthened \nduring the last one and half years, will be improved under the Project. The established project \nmanagement unit (PMU) for the ADB project is considered an embryo cell to be expanded and \nstrengthened to become an autonomous authority for state road development and maintenance. \n \nb.  Road Maintenance Financing \n \n15.  The  nonplan  budget  increased  from  Rs201  crore  ($52  million)  in  2003/04  to  \nRs311  crore  ($80  million)  in  2006/07,  an  annual  increase  of  15.6%.  The  maintenance \nrequirement until completion of the State Highway Development Program is not high as most \n                                                 \n2  Government of India. 2007. Bihar Road Sector Development \u2013 New Dimensions. New Delhi. \n3 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n \n ", " 4   \nstate highways and MDRs will be upgraded under the program. After the program, the budget \nrequirement for maintenance will be increased and is estimated at Rs420 crore ($108 million) \nannually. Revenue relating to road use is estimated at Rs308 crore ($79 million) in 2005/06, \nexcluding  excise,  with  historical  increase  of  20%  per  annum.  This  matches  maintenance \nrequirements and is absorbed in the general government revenue. \n \n16.  Efficiency of the use of nonplan budget has improved. The share of salaries and wages \nin the nonplan budget reduced from 43% in 2003/04 to 36% in 2006/07. This demonstrates \nGOB\u2019s increased commitment to maintenance and efficiency of road maintenance. Considering \npast budgetary provisions and trends, GOB is assessed as adequately providing maintenance \nfinancing in a sustainable manner. Increased maintenance quality due to introduction of 5-year \nperformance-based maintenance contracts will increase the efficiency of maintenance works \nand reduce maintenance costs. GOB has provided assurance that it will provide adequate \nfinancing to maintain state highways developed with ADB financing.  \n \nc.  Road Safety \n \n17.  Bihar has a higher accident rate (17.3 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles between 2001 and \n2004) than the national average (12.8 in 2003), and the rate is expected to increase as traffic \ngrows. One of the major causes of accidents is lack of awareness and knowledge of traffic \nrules. To enhance awareness of traffic rules, the Transport Department organizes a road safety \nweek every year for school children and the public. In Patna and major district centers including \nrural areas, the Transport Department undertakes inspection missions to ensure people follow \ntraffic rules. GOB is planning to establish state and district road safety councils to provide \nguidance on road safety.  \n \n18.  RCD will develop a road safety unit within its organization to institutionalize road safety \naudits, ensuring safety elements of India Roads Congress standards are incorporated in design \nand during construction. \n \n19.  In 1996, the Government recommended establishing a directorate of safety and traffic \nmanagement  and  set  up  a  road  safety  fund  allocating  1%  of  cess  revenue  for  national \nhighways. An expert committee at the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways will \nreview these recommendations and finalize a road safety policy to address legal, institutional, \nand  financial  issues  for  road  safety.  This  will  provide  a  new  context  for  the  funding  and \ninstitutional setup for state road safety. \n \nd.  Overloading \n \n20.  Overloading is a nationwide problem; the number of multiaxle trailers has increased. \nOverloaded trucks on Bihar\u2019s major highways are also expected to increase in accordance with \neconomic growth. An overloading control program is being set up; six weighbridges are being \ninstalled at state border points. More weighbridges will be installed, and regulations more strictly \nenforced, e.g., off-loading of overloaded trucks will be enforced in coordination with the police. \n \ne.  Vehicle Pollution Control \n \n21.  To support a clean environment, GOB amended the 1992 Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules to \nrequire all vehicles to have a pollution control certificate. All vehicles must undergo pollution \nchecks  to  obtain  the  certificate.  While  it  continues  to  establish  permanent  pollution  check \ncenters, GOB is encouraging the private sector to develop centers and has given permission for \n ", "    5\n103 so far. GOB has established centers in 21 of the 38 districts in the state. Emission test \nmachines are further required for each center.  \n \nf.  Construction Industry \n \n22.  The proposed large programs require good construction firms equipped with adequate \ntechnical personnel and modern construction machinery. In the absence of regular work in the \npast, the state\u2019s construction industry has become weak; only a few contractors are from \noutside the state. Local contractors have difficulty mobilizing the necessary financial resources \nto even bid and subsequently implement the works. \n \n23.  A local construction industry can develop around a large program if work is seen to be \navailable on a regular basis over a long time. Initially, local agencies could associate with \nqualified construction firms from outside the state, and acquire the necessary technical and \nmanagerial skills to subsequently qualify on their own. Good contractors from outside the state \nwill invest their resources only if they perceive a good opportunity in terms of contract size. \nUnder the Project, GOB made the contracts as large as possible to attract qualified bidders. \n \n24.  The infrastructure equipment bank was set up to lease construction equipment to local \ncontractors, starting with the first three branches at Bhagalpur, Muzaffapur, and Patna. This will \nhelp  expedite  the  process  of  road  construction  in  the  state.  RCD  simplified  contractor \nregistration  rules  to  reduce  barriers  to  entry.  This  will  help  increase  competition  between \ncontractors, and hence increase quality and reduce cost. \n \n25.  Key sector development initiatives are summarized in the institutional strengthening \naction plan (Appendix 3). \n \n  2.  External Assistance and ADB Strategy \n \n26.  External assistance to roads in India has been substantial. ADB has provided loans as \nwell as TA for about $3.7 billion. The World Bank has provided loans and grants totaling $5.6 \nbillion for upgrading national highways, improving state highways, and upgrading rural roads. \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has provided five loans for a total of $0.33 \nbillion to upgrade national highways and construct bridges. The Government of the United \nKingdom has provided TA to support the sector. ADB support has been developed in close \ncollaboration  with  these  key  development  partners.  Coordination  with  the  World  Bank  has \nparticularly been active for transport operations. Mini retreats for transport operations in South \nAsia have become a regular practice for headquarters staff. For the resident missions, a broad-\nbased  sector  collaboration  mechanism  has  been  instituted  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of \ninformation between key sector coordinators of both institutions. With the Government of Japan \nand JBIC, cooperation has been active, particularly for the railway and urban subsectors. ADB \nhas formed a close partnership with the Department for International Development (DFID) of the \nUnited Kingdom for the provision of TA for areas contributing to poverty reduction in India. Two \norganizations  hold  regular  coordination  meetings.  A  summary  of  external  assistance  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n27.  Since 2002, ADB has provided four loans to improve India\u2019s state road network; to \nMadhya Pradesh in 2002 and 2007, Chhattisgarh in 2003, and Uttarakhand in 2006. Other state \nroad projects are being prepared for the eight northeastern states and Jharkhand. In principle, \nADB\u2019s support is provided to improve state road management capacity along with physical \ninvestment to improve the state road network. The states have shared their experience to \n ", " 6   \nimprove sector management and project implementation capacity. ADB facilitates experience \nsharing by holding workshops in states utilizing TA for state road projects. \n \n28.  To provide assistance to Bihar, ADB, DFID, and the World Bank have established a \nBihar assistance coordination working group. The World Bank approved a development policy \nloan and credit in 20074 for policy and institutional reforms covering fiscal and procurement \nreforms,  governance  and  administrative  reforms,  investment  climate  reforms,  and  sector-\nspecific policy reforms. For the road sector in Bihar, it has been closely coordinated to make \nsynergy. The World Bank is providing support to rural road development and medium- to long-\nterm sector reform, while ADB provides support for developing state roads in parallel with \ninstitutional strengthening focusing on project delivery in coordination with DFID.  \n \n  3.  Lessons \n \n29.  Many  ongoing  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  India  are  experiencing  delays.  These \ndelays  are  mostly  attributable  to  (i)  lack  of  safeguard  consideration  in  the  selection  and \npreparation of investments, and insufficient support in safeguards planning and implementation; \nand  (ii)  the  gap  in  support  between  the  feasibility  phase  and  the  construction  phase  for \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  that  are  often  not  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  for \nprocurement of civil works contracts and recruitment of consultants. For the Project, RCD \nengaged detailed project report consultants to prepare subprojects and ADB provided support to \nRCD preconstruction activities so that the construction can commence without unnecessary \ndelay after loan approval. RCD has prepared bidding documents, in close consultation with \nADB,  and  initiated  advance  action  for  contracting,  such  as  engagement  of  construction \nsupervision consultants. RCD takes initiatives for speedy and quality completion of construction \nworks, which include regular weekly monitoring of project progress. \n \n30.  For state road projects, ADB has undertaken policy dialogue in sector performance \nimprovement;  ADB\u2019s  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  recommends  broadening  policy \ndialogue  while  ADB  has  been  promoting  private  sector  involvement  in  roads,  mostly  in \nrehabilitation and maintenance activities for state road projects. Under the Project, TA will be \nprovided to support RCD initiatives in setting up enabling environments for implementing public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  schemes.  The  Project  takes  into  account  broad  areas  to  be  improved \nincluding development of the local construction industry. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The Project will improve transport efficiency of the state road network in Bihar, which will \ncontribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction. This will be realized by \n(i)  improving  the  state  highway  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and  appropriate  road  usage,  \n(iii) increasing efficiency of transport services, and (iv) enhancing GOB capacity for road asset \ndevelopment and management. Improved roads will improve accessibility to social services and \nmarkets, and enhance the efficiency of road transport usage. \n \n                                                 \n4  IBRD and IDA. 2007.

Outputs \n32.  Investment Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about 820 km of \nstate highways identified under the State Highway Development Program, focusing on newly \ndeclared state highways. Consulting services will be provided to support implementation of civil \nworks. Under the program, about 2,800 km of state highways and 5,700 km of MDRs are \nidentified for rehabilitation and upgrading. During RCD\u2019s detailed project report preparation, \nmore than 1,000 km of state highways were initially selected and about 820 km of these were \nidentified for the Project, taking into account preliminary assessment of traffic volume, social \nand  environmental  impacts,  state  priority,  and  project  readiness  (Appendix  5).  Road \nimprovement works under the Project include improving roads to two lanes, strengthening \nculverts and bridges, constructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures, and constructing \nstructures for resettlement and rehabilitation.   \n \n33.  Institutional Development Component. The Project will provide equipment required by \nGOB to enhance sector capacity in areas such as quality control, survey and design, road \nsafety, and control of overloading and vehicle emissions. Major equipment includes laboratory \nequipment, survey and design equipment and software, vehicle emission and fitness testing \nmachine,  and  weighbridges.  The  consultants,  engaged  under  a  TA  to  support  institutional \nstrengthening, will identify the required equipment and timing for installation in line with the \ndetailed institutional development action plan (Appendix 3). \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  This is the first road construction project in Bihar to adopt international best practices of \nprocurement and contract management, e.g., international competitive bidding, FIDIC-based \ncontracts, and outsourcing of construction supervision. This will attract qualified contractors to \nparticipate  in  state  projects.  Contracts  are  packaged  into  a  larger  size  to  attract  qualified \ncontractors who will transfer the necessary technical and managerial skills to local contractors \nthrough  association  like  subcontracts.  RCD  officials  will  be  exposed  to  international  best \npractices in bidding procedures and contract management. ADB will provide support to RCD in \nmanaging FIDIC-based contracts. This exposure will help equip RCD with capacity to take on \nmodern road development methods such as performance-based contracts, long-term operation \nand maintenance contracts, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n35.  The Project was prepared in collaboration with state government officials of Madhya \nPradesh Road Development Corporation; they have gained substantial experience with ADB \nrequirements and procedures. RCD engaged detailed project report consultants with its own \nfunds, for possible ADB financing, and requested ADB to supplement the consultants\u2019 work to \nfully comply with ADB requirements. The engineering design is prepared to minimize social and \nenvironmental impacts. Advance actions have been undertaken to ensure that the construction \ncan be commenced without unnecessary delay. All of these are enabled by the support of ADB \nconsultants, various exchanges between officials of state road agencies, and workshops and \ntraining provided. The Project demonstrates sufficient lessons accumulated to share among \nstate road agencies to prepare and implement successful state road projects with improved \nproject readiness. \n \n ", " 8   \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n36.  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $468  million,  including  taxes,  duties, \ncommitment charges, and interest during construction (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 6.   \n \n37.  ADB will finance part of the local taxes and duties estimated at $47 million. On average, \ntaxes and duties, which amount to 9%\u201313% of project costs for construction of state highways \nin India, are considered reasonable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Financing Plan \n38.  The Government has requested a loan of $420,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n39.  The ADB loan will finance about 90% of the project cost. This is considered acceptable, \ntaking into account that (i) the Project is part of the $2 billion state road development programs \nover the next 5 years, excluding projects under the National Highway Development Program, \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s rural roads program, and the chief minister\u2019s rural roads program; (ii) the \nProject is part of ADB assistance to the Government\u2019s overall development program for roads, \nincluding the National Highway Development Program III ($12.5 billion by 2012) and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s rural roads program ($11 billion by 2009); (iii) state road development is the priority \nfor ADB assistance in India and the Project serves one of the poorest states in India; (iv) even if \nthe Project is included to the country program and strategy period starting from 2003, average \n ", "    9\ncost sharing will remain at 68%, which is less than the current country limit of 70%; and (v) the \nhigher cost sharing by ADB helps the state with fiscal reforms. \n \n40.  The Government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency to GOB on the same \nterms and conditions as received from ADB. GOB will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan. The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  420.0  89.7 \nGovernment  48.0  10.3 \n  Total  468.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be the state of Bihar through RCD. RCD has \nestablished a PMU at its headquarters, headed by a chief engineer, for implementation of the \nProject. RCD has also established five project implementation units, each headed by a project \nmanager, who will be responsible for the implementation of one or two project roads in the field. \nOne or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract package. The project \nmanagers will be delegated adequate technical and administrative authority for expeditious \nproject implementation. RCD will engage construction supervision consultants to act as the \nengineer for the civil works contracts. The organization structure for project implementation is in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, inclusive of procurement, preconstruction \nactivities in 2007, and defect liability period of 1 year. It is expected to be completed by January \n2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n43.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts \nwill be undertaken in nine contract packages (Appendix 9). These contracts are estimated at \nmore  than  $10  million  and  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. ADB standard bidding documents for large works with postqualification under the \ntwo-envelope system will be adopted. Equipment financed by the Project will be $4 million under \nthe  institutional  development  component,  and  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive \nbidding procedures if the estimated contract is $0.1 million to $1.0 million, and shopping if the \nestimated contract amount is less than $0.1 million. Contract packaging for equipment will be \nbased on required technical features and timing of procurement. The TA consultants engaged \nfor  institutional  development  will  identify  the  packages  during  TA  implementation.  The \nprocurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  10.  National  competitive  bidding  procedures  adopted  for \nprocurement of goods and services under the Project will use the advertised tender enquiry \n ", " 10   \nmethod stipulated in the General Financial Rules, 2005, and elaborated in the Manual on \nPolicies and Procedures for the Purchase of Goods issued in August 2006, by the Ministry of \nFinance of the Government, with clarifications and modifications described in the procurement \nplan. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  RCD  will  recruit  two international consulting  firms  using  the  quality and  cost-based \nselection method to supervise construction of civil works under the Project. One consultant will \nbe engaged for the north region and the other for the south. RCD will select and engage \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  About  68  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and about 3,020 person-months of national consultants will be required. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n45.  ADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  May  2007.  During  project \npreparation, RCD\u2019s procurement activities were well advanced; all contracts were bid out in \nFebruary 2008. Based on this, the Government and GOB requested retroactive financing for all \nproject components. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the \nProject in accordance with agreed procedures and during the 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. The Government and GOB have been informed that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption  \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, GOB, and RCD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject.  In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB \nto be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nExecuting Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n47.  RCD  has  significantly  strengthened  its  governance  during  the  last  2  years.  It  has \nstandardized bidding documents and initiated e-procurement for selected contracts. For project \nmanagement  and  monitoring,  RCD  introduced  strict  monitoring  systems  of  work  progress, \ncontrolled under the newly established supervision and monitoring wing. It discloses the targets, \nprogress, and achievements to the public on the website and in the local newspaper. RCD has \nidentified  roads  for  inclusion  in  public\u2013private  partnership  schemes,  and  outsourced  all \nmaintenance works to the private sector. Accounting officers in field offices have been deputed \nfrom the accountant general\u2019s office to ensure appropriate recording of financial matters. To \nensure construction quality, laboratory equipment is being enhanced, and mobile quality control \nsquads have been established in all district offices. It also introduced a third-party quality control \nsystem. To enhance competition and capacity of the construction industry, RCD set up an \n ", "    11\nequipment bank and simplified contractor registration rules. This will help increase competition \nbetween contractors, and hence increase quality and reduce cost. To enhance overall road \nsector  management,  TA  will  be  provided  for  institutional  strengthening  of  RCD,  which  will \nimprove governance of road administration and accountability and create an environment that \nencourages  competition  and  efficiency  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry.  For  the \nProject,  ADB  procurement  procedures  using  international  competitive  bidding  will  enhance \ntransparency  and  fair  competition,  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  FIDIC-based \ncontract management will mitigate corruption problems during implementation. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be \nused  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed under statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed $100,000. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  RCD will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds \nunder the project components and their subprojects. The accounts will be set up in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the \naccounts and related financial statements annually. The Government will submit consolidated \nannual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months from the end of \nthe previous fiscal year. The annual audit report will include an audit of the statement of \nexpenditure procedures, and will include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan proceeds \nand compliance with statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n50.  RCD will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly project progress reports, including any \nchanges to the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered and remedial \nactions taken, anticipated problems and the proposed remedial measures, and work to be \nundertaken in the following period. RCD will submit the quarterly progress reports to ADB within \n45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will include a summary financial account \nfor each subproject, expenditures to date, report on performance monitoring, and results of \nmonitoring of social and environmental impacts. \n \n51.  RCD will prepare and provide ADB with a road completion report within 3 months of \nphysical completion of each individual road and a project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion of transactions under the Project. These reports will provide a detailed evaluation of \nthe  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact, \neconomic rate of return, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  RCD will, within 3 months of the loan signing, develop a systematic project performance \nmonitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, for use throughout the life of \nthe Project. \n \n53.  RCD will establish, within 3 months of loan effectiveness, a baseline for performance \nindicators to be used for monitoring implementation of each road subproject. It will conduct \nannual evaluation surveys for each road subproject, in accordance with the project performance \n ", " 12   \nmonitoring  system,  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress,  and \nachievement of the project objectives. \n \n10.  Project Review \n54.  ADB and RCD will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures required to achieve the \nproject  objectives.  They  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  focusing  on  issues  related  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n55.  A TA for $1,000,000 for Institutional Strengthening of the Bihar Road Sector will support \nsome  of  GOB\u2019s  institutional  development  initiatives  set  out  in  the  action  plan  \n(Appendix 3). The focus of the TA will be to (i) redefine and restructure RCD to a state-of-the-art \nroad agency, and (ii) implement new business procedures and provide training to RCD officials \nto enable RCD to restructure and adopt a new institutional and management structure. New \nbusiness  procedures  will  cover  (i)  procurement  and  contracting  processes,  (ii)  planning \nprocesses, (iii) quality assurance systems, (iv) engineering (pavement design, maintenance \nmethods, and safety), and (v) human resource management.  \n \n56.  The consultants will undertake the services in close consultation with principal secretary \nand engineer-in-chief, RCD. They will conduct district and state training and workshops as \nrequired. They will consult with all RCD divisions to disseminate the concepts of the sector \ndevelopment initiative.  \n \n57.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB TA funding program, and be \ncarried  out  by  an  international  consulting  firm,  to  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. International consulting inputs of 31 person-months are \nrequired (Appendix 11). The TA will be implemented from October 2008 to August 2009. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Institutional and Operational Improvements \n \n58.  Improving management of the state road network through the institutional development \ncomponent  and  the  TA,  and  the  improvement  to  the  road  network  under  the  Project  will \nenhance overall road conditions and usability. This will increase travel speeds and reduce travel \ntime,  accidents,  and  overloading.  The  enhancement  of  RCD\u2019s  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment and management will improve road administration governance and accountability, \nand  create  an  environment  within  RCD  and  the  construction  industry  that  encourages \ncompetition  and  efficiency.  This  will  ensure  more  efficient  road  asset  development  and \nmanagement,  and  higher  quality  of  construction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in  decreased \nrecurrent costs over the medium and long term. This will lead to overall social and economic \ndevelopment in Bihar. \n \nB.  Economic Assessment \n \n59.  The approach used to evaluate the Project follows the standard practice of comparing \nlife cycle road agency and user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \n ", "    13\na 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model,  HDM-4,  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis focuses on transport cost savings. Value added from better transport links resulting in \nnew industries and employment are not quantified in this analysis but are captured through \nbenefits to generated traffic. \n \n60.  The EIRR for the roads evaluated varies from 15% to 48%. The EIRR for three roads is \nbelow 20%, and for five roads is higher than 30%. The Project, which is for the state road sector \nrather  than  for  individual  roads,  is  very  robust  with  a  high  EIRR,  satisfying  the  economic \nefficiency criteria. \n \n61.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  \n(i) construction costs increase by 15%, (ii) no time is saved, (iii) benefits decrease by 15%, and \n(iv) generated traffic is reduced by 50% in addition to a combination of (i) and (iii). The results \nshow that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. Only two roads \nhave an EIRR slightly below 12% in the worst case scenario. These two roads serve relatively \nless-developed areas of the state and their improvement will have a positive impact on the \ndevelopment of these areas. Considering their positive development impact and the fact that \neven in the worst case scenario, they have an EIRR more than 10%, these two roads are \nrecommended for implementation under the Project along with all other roads included in the \nanalysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n \n62.  RCD is currently undertaking a comprehensive road rehabilitation program to rehabilitate \nand upgrade 91% of state highways and 74% of MDRs in the next 5 years. During this period, \nthe funding requirement for maintenance is small compared to capital expenditure and can be \naccommodated by the budget. After completion of the rehabilitation program, sufficient funds \nare expected to be available for all recurrent and periodic maintenance work of the upgraded \nstate highways and MDRs; total annual maintenance costs are likely to be less than 4% of the \nprojected GOB budget or 40% of the RCD budget. \n \nD.  Social Impacts \n \n63.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact. GOB and the Planning Commission of India \nestimate that 42.6% of Bihar\u2019s total population lives below the poverty line, which is highest in \nthe country. The human development index,5 a composite of literacy, life expectancy, and per \ncapita income, has increased for Bihar as in the rest of India. Bihar\u2019s rank among the states has \nremained unchanged at 15 since 1981. The human development index for Bihar was 0.267 in \n2001 in comparison to the national value of 0.472. A poverty and social assessment was \nundertaken during project preparation. Agriculture is the mainstay of residents in the project \nareas, with the majority deriving their livelihood from agriculture and labor (both agricultural and \nnonagricultural). By improving state roads, economic opportunities are expected to increase by \n(i) enabling villagers to shift from subsistence farming to market-oriented agricultural surplus \nproduction; and (ii) helping local people, particularly rural youth, to work at better-paying jobs in \ntrading and other new jobs. The Project will indirectly contribute to social benefits such as \nimproved access to health, education, and social services. The Project will have a short-term \nimpact on poverty reduction as the rural poor will be hired for construction, tree planting, and \n                                                 \n5  National Planning Commission, Government of India. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi.  \n ", " 14   \nensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly increase earnings of the poor who \nare largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n64.  Gender. In Bihar, the gender ratio of the population is 921 females for every 1,000 \nmales (2001 census). The literacy rate is 47.53%: 60.32% for males and 33.57% for females \n(2001 census). Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different \nsocioeconomic groups in project influence areas. The majority of women work in the home and \noutside; the majority are consulted by their spouse and other family members prior to any family \ndecision. Improved road conditions will encourage better transport services, thereby improving \naccess for women and children to social services, markets, workplaces, higher education, better \nhealth facilities, and better employment opportunities for women and men.  \n65.  HIV/AIDS. India is on the brink of one of the biggest public health challenges in its \nhistory. The Government estimates that in 2006, about 2.45 million Indians were living with HIV \n(1.75 million\u20133.15 million) with an adult prevalence rate of 0.41%. According to India\u2019s National \nAIDS Control Organization, HIV infection is typically concentrated among poor, marginalized \ngroups,  including  sex  workers,  drug  users,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers  who  are \ncategorized  as  high-risk  groups.  These  groups,  particularly  truckers,  drive  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic and many studies indicate that infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nBihar is categorized as a low prevalence state. The detailed study undertaken during project \npreparation did not anticipate any risks that HIV/AIDS would increase as a result of the Project. \nIn addition, state, district, and block campaigns by the health department and state AIDS \nControl  Society  are  already  being  undertaken  to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease. \nInteractions with the medical health officer, AIDS counsellors, nongovernment organizations, \nand  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  officers  in  the  project  areas  indicate  that  2\u20133  block \nawareness campaigns are organized each year to increase awareness of HIV and AIDS. RCD \nwill conduct awareness program of social aspects including HIV/AIDS in project areas for which \nGOB may engage an agency/nongovernment organization. \n \n66.  Indigenous People. According to the Census of India 2001, Bihar has an indigenous \npeople population of 758,351, constituting 0.9% of the state\u2019s total population vis-\u00e0-vis the \nnational percentage of 8.2%. Of the 38 districts in Bihar, 6 have no indigenous people members; \nin the rest, the indigenous people population varies from 0.1% to 5.9%. Katihar district has the \nhighest proportion of indigenous people (5.9%), followed by Jamui (4.8%), Banka (4.7%), and \nPurnia (4.4%). Sheohar district has the lowest proportion (0.01%), preceded by Darbhanga and \nKhagaria (0.03% each). No demarcated indigenous people areas are located in the project \narea. Since the Project entails rehabilitating existing road alignments, the social assessments \nundertaken have revealed limited or no significant impact on indigenous people groups within \nthe  area  of  influence  of  the  project  roads.  Such  impacts  are  addressed  through  specific \nmeasures for indigenous groups embedded in the resettlement plans. The assessment also \nnotes that the indigenous people members in the project area have been mainstreamed and \nassimilated into the local population. The study undertaken for project preparation did not \nindicate differential impacts between indigenous and non-indigenous groups in project locations. \nThe  improved  road  network  is  expected  to  augment  access  to  socioeconomic  facilities  of \nindigenous people groups along with other sections of the subproject population. Construction \nwill not have any adverse consequences for socioeconomic conditions or lead to any disruption \nin the community life or culture of these communities. \n \n ", "    15\n67.  Resettlement Impacts. The Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the \nneed for land acquisition and resultant involuntary resettlement by means of adopting the most \nfeasible technical design. In addition, the Project entails rehabilitation of existing state roads, \nwhich will occur within the available right-of-way; no land acquisition will be required. A 100% \ncensus  was  conducted  based  on  detailed  design  of  nine  roads.  Resettlement  plans  were \nprepared in accordance with the Government\u2019s National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy \n2007, and GOB\u2019s Bihar Land Acquisition Resettlement & Rehabilitation Policy 2007, ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Operation  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement, for each road. Based on the census survey, all nine roads will have resettlement \nimpacts limited to nontitleholders as the proposed work is within the existing right-of-way. A total \nof 2,067 structures will be affected including 1,944 private structures (residential, commercial, \nand mixed), 5 community structures, 78 religious structures, and 40 government structures and \nutilities.  Among  the  1,944  private  structures,  1,156  belong  to  encroachers,  784  belong  to \nsquatters, and 4 are owned by business license holders. The compensation entitled for the loss \nof structures at replacement value, shifting assistance, and other income restoration assistance \nis detailed in the entitlement matrix of the resettlement plans. Special support provisions for \naffected people belonging to vulnerable groups, e.g., indigenous people groups, are included in \nthe resettlement plans. The total cost for resettlement for all nine subproject roads is estimated \nat Rs58 million. A summary of the resettlement plans is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n \n68.  The Project is classified \"B\" in accordance with Government and ADB environmental \nassessment requirements. Therefore, initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared \nfor  the  nine  subprojects.  The  summary  of  the  IEE  reports  provides  a  brief  description  of \nenvironmental conditions of the project-affected areas, a summary of potential environmental \nimpacts,  and  the  recommended  mitigation  measures.  The  summary  IEE  is  attached  as \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  and  will  be  disclosed  simultaneously  with  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President.  \n \n69.  The findings of the IEEs indicate that the Project is not expected to have adverse \nenvironmental impacts. The impacts mainly occur during construction and are mostly temporary. \nThe main causes are land clearing for widening the carriageway, earthwork involving cut and fill, \nand quarrying and transportation of construction materials to support construction activities. \nDuring the operation, direct local impacts are mostly related to road accidents. The IEE reports \ndetail  proposed  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  these  adverse  impacts.  They  include \nenvironmental  management  plans  to  guide  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  by \ncontractors, supervision consultant, and RCD through its PMU (to be assisted by a consultant). \nThe PMU with the assistance of a consultant and in close consultation with relevant state \nagencies, such as the Forest Department and Bihar Pollution Control Board, will be responsible \nfor carrying out environmental monitoring and preparing an environmental monitoring report on \nbehalf of RCD.   \n \nF.  Risks \n \n70.  A recent sector assistance program evaluation identified issues for state road projects in \nIndia, including (i) initial delays in implementation, (ii) risk of incomplete network development \nbecause of avoiding areas that require major involuntary resettlement and are environmentally \nsensitive, (iii) appropriateness of sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government \nto efficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \n ", " 16   \n71.  The risk of initial delays has already been mitigated through RCD\u2019s advance actions and \nsupport  provided  by  ADB  for  full  compliance  with  requirements.  Training  on  safeguard \nrequirements was provided to RCD staff to mitigate the potential risk of initial delays due to \nprocedural clearance. \n \n72.  Project  roads  were  identified  in  accordance  with  the  state  highway  development \nprogram. The Project will minimize or nullify any negative social and environmental impacts \nthrough appropriate engineering design. \n \n73.  The risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \ncontext in the institutional strengthening action plan by taking into account the rather short-term \nproject  duration,  actions  taken  by  GOB,  and  the  policy  framework  of  Bihar  Road  Sector \nDevelopment\u2013New Dimensions (footnote 2). \n \n74.  GOB has increased its maintenance budget to meet requirements and obtained the full \ngrants-in-aide provided by the Government\u2019s under the 12th Finance Commission by providing \nadequate funds under the nonplan budget. The risk of underutilization of the maintenance \nbudget is low based on the recent year\u2019s high utilization, resulting from RCD\u2019s strict monitoring \nsystems for project implementation. \n \n75.  Fiduciary risks are addressed by adopting international best practices in procurement \nwith ADB prior review; and parallel support by the World Bank and DFID in improving public \nfinancial management, governance, and anticorruption initiatives.   \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n76.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOB  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n77.

GOB shall cause RCD to report to ADB any change in the alignment of any project road, \nso as to determine if additional environmental assessment study is necessary. \n \n84.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Government through GOB shall cause RCD to ensure \nthat (i) the Project is implemented in accordance with the Government\u2019s National Rehabilitation \nand Resettlement Policy 2007, GOB\u2019s Bihar Land Acquisition Resettlement and Rehabilitation \nPolicy 2007, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Indigenous Peoples Policy \n(1998), and the resettlement plans; (ii) all affected people are given adequate opportunity to \nparticipate  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation;  (iii)  the  resettlement  plans  are \ndisclosed to the affected people, who are compensated and assisted prior to displacement from \ntheir houses, land, and assets; and before commencement of civil works in the relevant section \nof  the  project  road;  (iv)  affected  people  receive  priority  for  wage  employment  in  project \nconstruction; (v) additional assistance is provided for vulnerable groups; (vi) resettlement plans \nare updated, if necessary, in course of project implementation, disclosed to the affected people, \nand submitted to ADB for approval and disclosure on its website; (vii) civil works contracts under \nthe Project include requirements to comply with the resettlement plans; (viii) implementation of \nthe  resettlement  plans  is  monitored  (a)  internally  by  the  project  implementation  units  and \nreported  monthly  to  the  PMU,  which  shall  report  the  results  quarterly  to  ADB,  and  (b) \nindependently  by  an  expert  under  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and  reported \nbiannually directly to ADB; and (ix) affected people have an opportunity to express grievance at \nappropriate levels, and that local officials are instructed to resolve disputes and implement \nmeasures promptly. \n \n85.  HIV/AIDS,  Human  Trafficking,  and  Child  Labor.  GOB  shall  conduct  awareness \nprogram in respect of HIV/AIDs, human trafficking, and child labor in project areas for which \nGOB may engage an agency/nongovernment organization. RCD will ensure that the civil works \ncontracts under the Project incorporate provisions to the effect that the contractor is required to \n(i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor; (ii) disseminate information at worksites \non risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures \nfor those employed during construction; and (iii) follow and implement all statutory provisions on \nlabor (including equal pay for equal work and non-employment of child labor), health, safety, \nwelfare, sanitation, and working conditions. The civil works contract will provide for termination \nof the contracts by GOB and RCD in case of breach of any of the said provisions by the \ncontractors. \n \n ", " 18   \nVII.

Bihar, a landlocked state in the middle Gangetic region, has an area of 94,164 square \nkilometers. It is surrounded by Uttar Pradesh (west), Jharkhand (south), West Bengal (east), \nand Nepal (north). The state has a rich history and cultural tradition, making it a major religious \nand tourist destination. \n \n2.  While  an  extensive  and  well-developed  rail  system  passes  through  Bihar  and \nconsiderable  potential  exists  for  development  and  utilization  of  inland  waterways,  rapid \ndevelopment and strengthening of the road network will provide momentum for accelerating the \nprocess of economic development. \n \nA.  Road Network and Traffic \n \n3.  The road network in Bihar in 2007 is described in Table A2.1. Not all roads are of the \nsame type in terms of either width or quality. Most of the higher class of roads have been \nprovided with a sealed (bitumen or concrete) surface while the less important ones remain \nunsealed (metalled or gravel). \n \nTable A2.1: Roads in Bihar \n(kilometers) \n     \nNo.  Class of Road  Sealed  Gravel/Earth  Total \n1.

New Delhi. Updated \nfor national highways, state highways, and major district roads. \n \n4.  The carrying capacity of a road is governed by its carriageway width. Nearly 70% of state \nhighways and 80% of the major district roads (MDRs) are single lane (Table A2.2). Of national \nhighways, 45% have not been improved to two or more lanes. \n \nTable A2.2: Distribution of Roads by Carriageway Width (%) \nPercent of Road Length \nTwo or \nSingle  Intermediate  More \nNo.  Class of Road  Lane  Lane  Lanes  Total \n1.

The  road  network  is  poorly  developed,  and  for  years  has  been  underfunded  and \nexperienced extensive damage due to lack of maintenance, overloading, and frequent floods. \nRecent  floods  have  washed  away  many  roads  built  recently  under  various  government \nprograms. The road density in Bihar is only 901 kilometers (km) per million population compared \nwith the national average of 2,567. About half of villages lack all-weather road connectivity. Most \nroads have poor riding quality, poor geometry, weak pavement, and inadequate capacity; and \n ", "22 Appendix 2 \nlack bridges. The result is high transport costs and excessive travel time. A major part of the \nnetwork is almost not usable. \n \n6.  Vehicle registrations increased from 0.95 million in 2000/01 to 1.56 million in 2006/07, an \nannual averaging increase of 8.6%. The highest increase was 2-wheelers; excluding the 2-\nwheelers, the increase is 5.5%. Trucks increased at a very low rate, whereas tractors and \ntrailers have increased more quickly. This may be mainly due to the poor road network, where \ntractors  and  trailers  are  preferred  for  transporting  goods,  especially  agricultural  produce\u2014\nagriculture is the mainstay of the rural economy. The number of trucks, especially multiaxle \ntrailers, is expected to increase once the road conditions and network are improved.  \n \nB.  Asset Management of State Roads \n \n7.  Bihar Road Construction Department (RCD) is responsible for state highways, MDRs, \nand national highways approved and funded by the Government of India (the Government). Of \nthe  3,700  km  of  national  highways  in  Bihar,  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  is \nresponsible for 800 km. The Government recently approved upgrading 890 km of national \nhighways  to  four  lanes  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  III  using  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT).  Roads  that  GOB  identifies  for  development  on  a  BOT  basis  are \nentrusted to India Infrastructure Finance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance \nCompany  to  structure  and  implement  the  projects.  District  councils  and  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  ODRs  and  village  roads.  The  Rural  Works  Department  is \nresponsible for the chief minister\u2019s rural roads program, Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \n(MMGSY),  which  connects  habitations  with  populations  of  500\u2013999,  in  parallel  with  the \nnationwide  Prime  Minister\u2019s  rural  roads  program,  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY), which gives priority to connectivity for habitations with populations of more than \n1,000. The chief minister\u2019s rural roads program follows the basic principles and incorporates the \ngood practices of the Prime Minister\u2019s rural roads program, but employs more decentralized \nadministrative and technical sanction procedures, and utilizes a separate set of guidelines for \nproject selection. \n \n8.  RCD is responsible for construction and maintenance of roads on behalf of GOB. The \nengineer-in-chief is the technical head of the department and professional advisor to GOB on \npolicy and implementation related to road construction. The engineer-in-chief reports to the \nRCD  principal  secretary.  RCD  is  organized  with  four  wings,  which  are  responsible  for \nconstruction and maintenance of roads (north Bihar, south Bihar, national highway, special \nproject). The wings are headed by chief engineers who are responsible for implementation of \npolicy and overall supervision of RCD administration. \n \n9.  Under each wing are circle offices headed by superintending engineers. Under every \ncircle are divisions, headed by executive engineers. They are the basic operations units and \nexecutive engineers are responsible for management of works including contracts and payment \nfor works. In every division, subdivisions are headed by assistant engineers who manage and \nsupervise  works  within  their  subdivision.  This  involves  design  and  contract  management \nincluding quality control and testing. Assistant engineers are required to check the quality and \nquantity  (measurement)  of  works.  Under  every  subdivision  are  sections  headed  by  junior \nengineers  who  are  the  basic  field  functionaries  and  responsible  for  managing  actual \nconstruction  activity  in  the  field,  taking  measurements,  giving  day-to-day  guidance,  and \nreporting to the assistant engineer. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  23\n10.  In addition, there are wings in charge of surveys and planning (advance plan); design, \ntraining,  and  research  (central  design  office);  monitoring  implementation  (supervision),  and \nmaintaining RCD equipment including machinery for roads (mechanical). RCD has divisions in \ncharge of procurement (headed by a director) and transport (headed by a special officer), \ncentrally operated under the engineer-in-chief. \n \n11.  The existing RCD headquarters organization meets the assigned requirements. The \nmechanical wing functions well, and is equipped with adequate machines and compactors. The \nBihar State Bridge Construction Corporation effectively undertakes all major bridge works in the \nstate.  However,  the  capacity  of  RCD  for  core  processes  requires  strengthening  and \nreorganization, especially in the areas of policy making, planning, and programming. No training \ninstitutes  are  available  to  train  contractors  and  RCD  personnel  to  improve  their  skills  in \nconstruction management. \n \nC.  Road Transport Regulation and Industry \n \n12.  The Bihar Transport Department is responsible for licensing, registration, and regulation \nof motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport; as well as road safety policy and \nenforcing axle-load regulations. It has started to address controlling overloading and installing \nsix  weigh  stations  at  entry  points  into  the  state.  Installation  of  additional  weighbridges  is \nplanned. Traffic police, under the Home Department, are responsible for enforcing traffic and \nroad safety regulations. The Transport Department is headed by principal secretary and its \nfunctions are designed in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The \nprincipal legislation and regulations affecting the functioning of the department are the Motor \nVehicles Act, 1988; Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989; Bihar Motor Vehicles Rules, 1992; \nBihar Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1994; Bihar Motor Vehicles Tax Rules, 1994; Bengal Ferries \nAct and rules; and Inland Vessels Act, 1917. The principal functions of the department are \nrevenue collection; registration of vehicles; issuance of permits; inspection of vehicles and \nenforcement of penalties under various central and state laws and regulations; monitoring, \nimplementing, and coordinating interstate and interregional transport arrangements; prevention \nof vehicular pollution and enforcement of relevant regulations; and maintenance of statistical \ndata for the use of the central and state governments and transport organizations. \n \n13.  The state-owned Bihar State Road Transport Corporation provides intra- and interstate \nbus services with about 350 buses, i.e., about 2%\u20133% of buses operated in the state. It is \ncurrently restructuring in line with the state program. Buses are replaced with new ones, and \nfleet utilization, bus productivity, and effective operation kilometers are being improved. Most of \nthese efficiency parameters are also expected to be improved as a result of improving road \nconditions. GOB grants permission to contract and private buses to use the same routes as the \nState Road Transport Corporation. GOB authorized the corporation to fix fares based on sound \nbusiness principles. Private bus operators adopt different fares based on demand for specific \nroutes.  Truck  hire  rates  are  fixed  by  market  demand.  Competition  is  good.  Private  sector \noperators provide most of the services for passenger and freight transport.  \n \nD.  Road Expenditures and Revenues \n \n14.  Budgetary expenditure for state roads in 2006/07 was Rs1,974 crore1 ($506 million) \ncompared with the original budget of Rs2,147 crore ($551 million). In 2006/07, the budget is 2.8 \ntimes  larger  than  the  previous  year\u2019s  Rs648  crore  ($171  million)  due  to  the  new  state \n                                                 \n1 A crore is equal to 10,000,000. \n ", "24 Appendix 2 \ngovernment\u2019s  high  priority  for  road  rehabilitation  and  development,  supported  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s grant fund (Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana). The extent of underspending was only \n8% of the original budget. This demonstrates remarkable improvement in RCD\u2019s capacity and \ncommitment to deliver. The 2007/08 budget increased to Rs2,378.85 crore ($610 million). Table \nA2.3 summarizes the plan and nonplan budget allocation with details of the nonplan budget. \n \nTable A2.3: Road Construction Department Budget Allocation and Expenditure \n(Rs Crore) \nItem  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07 \nBudget Allocation             \n   Plan  120.88  318.48  648.04  1,804.80 \n   Nonplan  228.22  248.00  289.56  342.31 \n     Wages and Salaries  101.81  107.01  116.41  126.01 \n     Maintenance  124.92  140.15  172.15  215.00 \n      Other  1.50  0.83  1.00  1.30 \n   Total  349.10  566.48  937.60  2,147.11 \nExpenditure             \n   Plan  51.20  133.87  263.26  1,663.25 \n   Nonplan  201.23  228.31  263.95  310.78 \n     Wages and Salaries  87.03  89.27  98.00  112.70 \n     Maintenance  112.78  138.25  164.97  196.86 \n      Other  1.42  0.80  0.99  1.23 \n   Total  252.43  362.18  527.21  1,974.03 \nSource: Bihar state government. \n \n15.  Revenues relating to road use, including vehicle taxes, permits, fees, and penalties, \nwere Rs308 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, up from Rs178 crore ($87 million) in 2002/03. The \naverage annual increase is very high at 20% due to improved vehicle registration and tax \npayments. In addition, road users pay commercial sales taxes such as for vehicles, fuel, tires, \nand  spare  parts.  The  Transport  Department  is  one  of  the  major  resource-generating \ndepartments along with the commercial tax, registration, and excise departments. \n \nE.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n16.  The state\u2019s road network is very poor in terms of coverage and conditions. Demand for \nroad transport is increasing. Insufficient funding to road maintenance in the past has increased \nthe  number  of  roads  that  are  beyond  maintainable  condition  and  the  backlog  of  deferred \nmaintenance. GOB has taken on the State Highway Development Program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade state highways to at least 2 lanes, and expand the state highway network by upgrading \nMDRs to 2 lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km of the 3,127 km of state highways \nduring the 11th Five Year Plan period through various schemes, including the Government-\nsupported RSVY, BOT schemes, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. \n \n17.  GOB also takes on sector development initiatives in the framework specified in Bihar \nRoad  Sector  Development\u2013New  Dimensions2 to  develop  and  sustain  the  road  network  by \nmodernizing  road  agencies;  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  road  financing; \n                                                 \n2  Government of India. 2007. Bihar Road Sector Development \u2013 New Dimensions. New Delhi. \n ", "Appendix 2  25\noutsourcing design, supervision, and construction along with systems for independent proof \nchecking  and  audit;  setting  up  a  stable  source  of  funding  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance;  attracting  financially  sound  and  fully  equipped  contractors  by  offering  large \ncontracts  for  national  and  state  highway  projects;  enabling  smaller  contractors  to  acquire \nexperience; introducing long-term, performance-based maintenance contracts; initiating corridor \nmanagement to expedite clearance of utilities and availability of materials; and strengthening \ncapacity of local contractors. \n \n1.  Sector Institution Framework \n \n18.  The sheer magnitude of the task requires substantial improvement in efficiency of sector \nmanagement. Currently RCD is in charge of all state roads, e.g., state highways and MDRs, \nirrespective of strategic importance requiring priority improvement and maintenance. \n \n19.  Approaches identified by the Bihar road sector development strategy (footnote 2) include \n(i) harnessing private sector structures and skills to meet public demand for infrastructure;  \n(ii) encouraging private sector participation in road financing; and (iii) outsourcing functions of \nproject preparation, design, construction, construction supervision, and quality audit to private \nentities. This would leave government functionaries with the limited but important responsibility \nof policy development and management oversight, and improving accountability concentrating \non performance monitoring and output, rather than the day-to-day running of public services. \n \n20.  For this purpose, RCD initially outsourced works of upgrading old state highways under \nRSVY with Rs3,000 crores ($790 million) to other road implementation agencies, targeting \ncompletion by 2008/09. Work on the remaining 1,554 km, of newly declared state highways, is \nproposed to be implemented with international best practices with ADB financing, adopting \nFIDIC3-based contract management and international competitive bidding procedures. GOB has \nbeen discussing potential BOT projects for 500 km of national highways with India Infrastructure \nFinance Company and Infrastructure Development Finance Company. \n \n21.  For long-term frameworks, it is often effective to split the functions of road development \npolicy/programming, and project implementation. While the government would determine the \nextent, an autonomous body like a highway authority or road development corporation would \nexecute  the  project,  e.g.,  project  preparation,  design,  bidding,  and  contract  awards  and \nmanagement. This will ensure efficient decision making for program implementation and help \nbuild up expertise in outsourcing technical work, understanding FIDIC, other new forms of \ncontracts, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n22.  RCD  is  considering  setting  up  a  state  road  and  highway  development  authority  to \nstreamline decision-making and provide more autonomy for project execution and delivery. This \nrequires redefining powers, functions, and accountability of road agencies. The established \nproject management unit of the ADB project is considered an embryo cell to be expanded and \nstrengthened to be an autonomous authority for state road development and maintenance. \n \n23.  All right-of-way management authority is currently with police and revenue departments, \nand  managing  encroachments  requires  time,  resulting  in  time  and  cost  overruns  for  road \nprojects. Well-defined right-of-way and asset management authority should be placed with RCD \nengineers to provide long-term benefits of road development planning. \n                                                 \n3 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n \n ", "26 Appendix 2 \n \n2.  Business Procedures \n \n24.  RCD  undertakes  businesses  in  accordance  with  the  1958  Bihar  Public  Works \nDepartment Code. Layers of approval for project sanctioning are required, which takes time for \nproject approval and payment to contractors. GOB recently amended the code to delegate more \nsanctioning power with increased financial amount to field offices, which helps expedite project \nimplementation. RCD\u2019s sector management capability was significantly strengthened during the \nlast one and half years. Major actions taken by RCD include streamlining bidding procedures, \nquality control, asset management, and project management. \n \n25.  Procurement and Bidding Documents. For procurement and subsequent execution of \nworks, outdated performance standards resulted in very poor quality of the road network. No \nmechanism  was  available  to  measure  contractor  performance.  RCD  developed  standard \nbidding documents for civil works in 2006 to streamline procurement procedures. For larger \ncontract  packages,  such  as  those  under  ADB  financing,  it  adopts  FIDIC  contracts  and \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. \n \n26.  Quality Control. A 2\u20133 year performance guarantee and/or defect liability are included \nin contracts. Laboratory equipment is being enhanced, and mobile quality control squads are set \nup in all district offices. A third-party quality control system has been introduced. \n \n27.  Asset  Management.  A  geographic  information  system-linked  database  of  road \ninventory  and  work  history  is  currently  being  prepared.  At  the  same  time,  a  new  asset \nmanagement  system  is  being  set  up,  which  plans  the  budget  under  headings  of  routine \nmaintenance,  periodic maintenance,  widening/strengthening,  and  resurfacing.  This  will  help \ndevelop optimal allocations of the road budget for development and maintenance.   \n \n28.  Project Management and Monitoring. RCD introduced penalty and bonus clauses in \ncontracts to motivate completion of projects on time. To implement the system, RCD introduced \nstrict monitoring systems of work progress. This will be connected online between all field \noffices and headquarters by the end of this fiscal year. Accounting officers for the field offices \nwere deputed from the accountant general\u2019s office to ensure appropriate recording of financial \nmatters.  \n \n3.  Road Maintenance Financing \n \n29.  The  nonplan  budget  increased  from  Rs201  crore  ($52  million)  in  2003/04  to  \nRs311  crore  ($80  million)  in  2006/07,  an  annual  increase  of  15.6%.  The  maintenance \nrequirement until completion of the State Highway Development Program is not high as most \nstate highways and MDRs will be upgraded under the program. After the program, the budget \nrequirement for maintenance will be increased and is estimated at Rs420 crore ($108 million) \nannually. Revenue relating to road use is estimated at Rs308 crore ($79 million) in 2005/06, \nexcluding  excise,  with  historical  increase  of  20%  per  annum.  This  matches  maintenance \nrequirements and is absorbed in the general government revenue. \n \n30.  Efficiency of the use of nonplan budget has improved. The share of salaries and wages \nin the nonplan budget reduced from 43% in 2003/04 to 36% in 2006/07. This demonstrates \nGOB\u2019s increased commitment to maintenance and efficiency of road maintenance. Considering \npast budgetary provisions and trends, GOB is assessed as adequately providing maintenance \nfinancing in a sustainable manner. Increased maintenance quality due to introduction of 5-year \n ", "Appendix 2  27\nperformance-based maintenance contracts will increase the efficiency of maintenance works \nand reduce maintenance costs. GOB has provided assurance that it will provide adequate \nfinancing to maintain state highways developed with ADB financing.  \n \n4.  Road Safety \n \n31.  Bihar has a higher accident rate (17.3 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles between 2001 and \n2004) than the national average (12.8 in 2003), and the rate is expected to increase as traffic \ngrows. One of the major causes of accidents is lack of awareness and knowledge of traffic \nrules. To enhance awareness of traffic rules, the Transport Department organizes a road safety \nweek every year for school children and the public. In Patna and major district centers including \nrural areas, the Transport Department undertakes inspection missions to ensure people follow \ntraffic rules. GOB is planning to establish state and district road safety councils to provide \nguidance on road safety. \n \n32.  RCD will develop a road safety unit within its organization to institutionalize road safety \naudits, ensuring safety elements of India Roads Congress standards are incorporated in design \nand during construction. \n \n33.  In 1996, the Government recommended establishing a directorate of safety and traffic \nmanagement  and  set  up  a  road  safety  fund  allocating  1%  of  cess  revenue  for  national \nhighways. An expert committee at the Ministry of Sipping, Road Transport and Highways will \nreview these recommendations and finalize a road safety policy to address legal, institutional, \nand  financial  issues  for  road  safety.  This  will  provide  a  new  context  for  the  funding  and \ninstitutional setup for state road safety. \n \n5.  Overloading \n \n34.  Overloading is a nationwide problem and the number of multiaxle trailers is increasing. \nOverloaded  trucks  are  expected  to  increase  on  major  Bihar  highways  in  accordance  with \neconomic growth. An overloading control program being set up comprises 43 actions, such as \nmultilane weighbridge installation with separate lanes for small vehicles, officers residing at \ncheck  posts,  computerized  processing  and  networking,  and  smart-card-based  systems  for \nverification and payment. Initially, six weighbridges are being installed at state border points, \nand  more  are  planned.  Strict  enforcement  of  the  regulation,  e.g.,  practicing  off-loading  of \noverloaded trucks, will be undertaken in coordination with the police. \n \n6.  Vehicle Pollution Control \n \n35.  To support a clean environment, GOB amended the 1992 Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules to \nrequire all vehicles to have a pollution control certificate. All vehicles must undergo pollution \nchecks  to  obtain  the  certificate.  While  it  continues  to  establish  permanent  pollution  check \ncenters, GOB is encouraging the private sector to develop centers and has given permission for \n103 so far. GOB has established centers in 21 of the 38 districts in the state. Emission test \nmachines are now required for each center.  \n \n7.  Construction Industry \n \n36.  The proposed large programs require good construction firms equipped with adequate \ntechnical personnel and modern construction machinery. In the absence of regular work in the \npast, the state\u2019s construction industry has become weak; only a few contractors are from \n ", "28 Appendix 2 \noutside the state. Local contractors have difficulty mobilizing the necessary financial resources \nto even bid and subsequently implement the works. \n \n37.  A local construction industry can develop around a large program if work is seen to be \navailable on a regular basis over a long time. Initially, local agencies could associate with \nqualified construction firms from outside the state, and acquire the necessary technical and \nmanagerial skills to subsequently qualify on their own. Good contractors from outside the state \nwill invest their resources only if they perceive a good opportunity in terms of contract size. \nUnder the Project, GOB made the contracts as large as possible to attract qualified bidders. \n \n38.  The infrastructure equipment bank, QUIPO, was set up to lease construction equipment \nto local contractors, starting with the first three branches at Bhagalpur, Muzaffapur, and Patna. \nThis will help expedite the process of road construction in the state. RCD simplified contractor \nregistration rules to reduce barriers to entry to help increase competition between contractors, \nand hence increase quality and reduce cost. \n \n39.

Objective \n \n1.  The main objective of the consulting services is to support the government of Bihar \n(GOB) in improving sector management performance by implementing institutional development \ninitiatives. The focus of the technical assistance (TA) is to (i) redefine and restructure the Road \nConstruction Department (RCD) as a state-of-the-art road agency, and (ii) implement new \nbusiness procedures and provide training to RCD officials to enable RCD to adopt a new \ninstitutional and management structure. New business procedures will cover (i) procurement \nand  contracting  processes,  (ii)  planning  processes,  (iii)  quality  assurance  systems,  \n(iv) engineering (pavement design, maintenance methods, and safety), and (v) human resource \nmanagement. \n \nB.  Scope of Services \n \n2.  The  consultants  will  undertake  the  services  in  close  consultation  with  the  principal \nsecretary  and  engineer-in-chief,  RCD.  They  will  conduct  state  and  district  training  and \nworkshops as required. RCD-wide consultation will be conducted to disseminate the concepts of \nthe sector development initiative.  \n \n3.  For  a  long-term  framework,  splitting  the  functions  of  road  development  policy  and \nprogramming  from  project  implementation  is  often  effective.  While  the  government  would \ndetermine  the  extent,  an  autonomous  body  like  a  state  highway  authority  (SHA)  or  road \ninfrastructure corporation (RIC) would execute the project, e.g., project preparation, design, \nbidding, contract awards, and management. This will ensure efficient decision making for project \nimplementation and help build up expertise in outsourcing of technical work, understanding \nFIDIC,1 using new forms of contracts, and developing public\u2013private partnerships. For these \nterms of reference, the newly modernized RCD is, in any form, named as the SHA/RIC. \n \n4.  The consultant will be expected to undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Recommend an appropriate institutional structure for managing the overall state road \nnetwork, including state highways and major district roads. \n(ii)  Recommend appropriate management structures for managing each layer of the \nroad network. \n(iii)  Review existing and draft laws and acts being prepared for Bihar and examples in \nother  states  and  countries;  and  use  these  to  develop  a  draft  highway  act, \nincorporating adequate provision for concession arrangements like public\u2013private \npartnerships for consideration by GOB.  \n(iv)  Recommend and implement new business procedures, and provide training to RCD \nstaff to enable restructuring and adoption of a new institutional and management \nstructure. \n \n1.  Institutional Framework  \n \n5.  The main task of the consultants is to seek agreement from various groups involved on \nhow roads are to be administered. They will be expected to (i) examine if SHA and/or RIC \n                                                 \n1 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n   ", "Appendix 11  45\nremain  responsible  for  all  state  highways  and  major  district  roads,  or  be  dedicated  to \nstrategically important roads with other roads left for RCD; (ii) identify functions and powers \nRCD and/or SHA and/or RIC require for effective corridor management; and (iii) identify and \nstructure  for  SHA  and/or  RIC  to  be  able  to  work  as  a  project  implementation  agency  for \ndedicated roads, e.g., strategically important roads. \n \n2.  Management Structures  \n \n6.  The institutional analysis should determine how each part of the road network is to be \nmanaged.  The  task  following  is  to  recommend  appropriate  organization  and  management \nstructures for SHA/RIC. The intention is to do most road works under contract. RCD and \nSHA/RIC should thus be primarily staffed to plan and manage the road network, and to hire and \nsupervise consultants and contractors to carry out any required civil works. In this connection, \nthe consultant will be expected to undertake the following: \n  \n(i)  Recommend an appropriate organization structure for SHA/RIC, including the \nneed  for  a  management  board  (including  functions,  composition,  and \nremuneration of members). Recommend the management structure, e.g., chief \nexecutive  officer  (CEO)  and  line  managers,  and  develop  procedures  for \nappointing the CEO and, if necessary, the deputy CEO; and the relationship \nbetween other line departments, the board, and the CEO.  \n(ii)  Define the middle-management structure. Arrangements should articulate the \nregional structure of the proposed organization. Proposals should indicate the \nmiddle management structure, how it relates to the CEO, and appropriate terms \nand conditions for staff employment for staff to ensure the agency can attract and \nretain suitably qualified staff. \n(iii)  Propose suitable financial reporting and accounting arrangements. Proposals \nshould  include  recommended  formats  for  simple  accounts  to  help  SHA/RIC \nmaintain effective financial control; including identification of costs by activity and \nproject; and preparation of a consolidated income statement, partial balance \nsheet, and cash flow statement. Advise on the most appropriate way of reflecting \nshortfalls in regular road maintenance and erosion of capital in the accounts.  \n(iv)  Propose  (a)  arrangements  for  establishing  a  performance-based  budgeting \nsystem for planning, implementing, and monitoring road maintenance; and (b) an \nappropriate auditing system, including internal audit and control procedures, with \nindependent external audit arrangements.  \n(v)  Recommend how SHA/RIC should deal with planning and management of road \nnetworks. \n(vi)  Identify arrangements needed for the unclassified road network. Determine if a \nform of cost-sharing arrangement would encourage local communities to take \nownership. When they agree to take ownership of these roads, tracks, and trails, \nidentify  how  to  register  their  commitment  and  provide  advice  and  technical \nassistance. Identify arrangements to ensure the funds allocated from the road \nfund are used effectively. \n \n3.  Highway Act \n \n7.  The consultant will be expected to review draft laws being prepared for Bihar and \nexamples from other states and countries, and taking into account the work specified in the \nterms of reference, to prepare a draft highway act.

The \npreference  is  for  short  enabling  legislation,  supported  by  regulations  to  be \npublished (and updated) by RCD and GOB. \n \n4.  Business Procedures  \n \n8.  Adherence to old codes and procedures sometimes cause delays in preparing and \nimplementing projects. Decision making is not sufficiently decentralized and operating decisions \nare delayed due to too many layers of interventions. RCD is aware of the need to streamline \nbusiness  procedures  and  introduce  internationally  recognized  systems  and  practices  for \nprocurement, quality management, planning, contract and project management, and financial \nmanagement. \n  \n9.  The consultants are to help RCD and SHA/RIC to become modern road management \nagencies.  This  requires  introducing  new  business  procedures  for  new  institutional  and \nmanagement  structures,  covering  (i)  procurement  and  contracting  processes,  (ii)  planning \nprocesses, (iii) quality assurance systems, (iv) engineering (pavement design, maintenance \nmethods, and safety), and (v) human resource management. \n \n    a.

The consultants will establish manuals, introduce the system, and provide training to \nconcerned officials in RCD and SHA/RIC in pavement design, maintenance methods, and \nsafety audit. \n \n    e.  Human Resource Management \n \n14.  RCD engineers are competent but need training, capacity building, and more effective \ncadre management; career development strategies are needed. Avenues for promotion of staff \nhave  to  be  ensured,  particularly  for  lower  level  functionaries.  The  consultants  will  do  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Identify human resource requirements and assist RCD and SHA/RIC in recruiting \nadequate  number  of  staff  for  planning,  procurement,  quality  assurance,  and \nsocial and environment aspects. \n(ii)  Develop and implement a scheme of skill development and redeployment in \nother organizations for full utilization of available human resources. \n(iii)  Develop cadre management and help RCD and SHA/RIC with implementation to \nensure opportunities for promotion and adequate staffing. \n(iv)  Develop continuous results-oriented posting of personnel and help RCD and \nSHA/RIC with implementation. \n(v)  Identify training requirements and develop a learning and training program. \n \nC.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBetween 2002 and 2006, based on 1999 constant prices, India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 8.6%, \nlargely pushed by transportation and communication (including trade), agriculture, and manufacturing. Of all the industry \nsubsectors, transportation, communication, and trade combined for the highest share, at 25.6% of the country\u2019s GDP. This \nperformance should be largely credited for the country\u2019s impressive economic growth and for reducing poverty. However in \nsome poor areas, gains from economic growth have yet to be distributed equitably, including in the state of Bihar. \n \nIn 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the 2008\u20132010 country operations business plana. This is part of the \nlarger 2008\u20132012 India country partnership strategy. Under the strategy, support for infrastructure development will remain \nthe core focus of ADB\u2019s India assistance strategy. For transport and communications, the Bihar State Highways Project will be \nADB\u2019s first support for Bihar\u2019s roads; it aims to improve transport connectivity within the state. The Project will augment \ntransport capacity in a financially sustainable manner. As Bihar is one of the least-developed states in India, the Project is \nexpected to have significant development impacts. Its short-term impacts on poverty reduction include employment of poor \npeople in road construction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly increase their \nearnings, especially for those who are largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. Over the long-term, \nvillagers are expected to shift from subsistence farming to market-oriented agricultural surplus production. The Project will \nhelp residents, particularly the youth, of rural areas to work for better-paying jobs in trading and other new employment areas. \nMoreover, it will directly contribute to peoples\u2019 access to social benefits such as health, education, and social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nThe main objective of the Project is to rehabilitate the state roads in Bihar and augment connectivity within the state. The \nProject will cover an estimated 820 kilometers of state roads in 18 districts, hence creating a reliable and efficient road \nnetwork within the state. Some of the immediate benefits will be improved access to socioeconomic facilities, safe and \ncomfortable journeys with reduced fuel consumption and vehicle operating cost, and development of the rural economy. \n \nA socioeconomic baseline survey, community consultations, and focus group discussions were undertaken for all the \nsubprojects during August\u2013October 2007. In addition, poverty analysis using secondary data, and a review of government \nprograms and schemes were conducted. The data revealed that 42.6% of the total population in Bihar lives below the poverty \nline, the highest in the country. The human development index for Bihar was 0.267 in 2001 in comparison to the national \nvalue of 0.472. The people largely depend on agriculture, which has the lowest value-added among the country\u2019s industries. \nThe literacy rate at 47.53% is also an issue; 60.32% for males and 33.57% for females.  \n \n2.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nBihar has a large population, a high unemployment rate, and increasing social tensions arising from failure to meet \ndevelopment aspirations. The main sources of income of residents in the project locations are agriculture wages or casual \nnonfarm jobs. Many are landless or near landless. All economic and noneconomic indicators indicate their poor status. All \nbasic services and infrastructure are poor. The communities look forward to having upgraded roads as improved transport \nservices will provide them with better economic opportunities and quality of life.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \n \nA socioeconomic survey covering 908 households from 20 districts, and 73 focus group discussions were conducted during \nAugust\u2013October  2007  to  gather  feedback  from  local  communities  on  the  proposed  development  and  perceived \nsocioeconomic impacts. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, indigenous people, high-income groups, the \npoor,  shopkeepers,  and  truckers  to  ensure  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  Project  and  its  impacts.  Other  key \nstakeholders such as government officials; including Bihar Sate AIDS Control Society, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, village \nhealth workers, and block development officers were consulted by means of key stakeholder discussions. Additionally, \nscreening and categorization checklists were completed for each road to assess the likely impact of project development in \nterms of indigenous population and involuntary resettlement.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nC&P will be carried out during implementation of resettlement plans by local nongovernment organizations.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. Gender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by undertaking a process of gender \nanalysis to assess the impact of the Project. Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different \nsocioeconomic groups such as high-income group, the poor, and women belonging to other vulnerable classes. These \ndiscussions brought forth that the majority of the women felt the expansion of the road will benefit them as they will be able to \ntransport their products to markets and help increasing household income. They expected that some local residents will get \ninvolved in project activities. They wanted that the road should be constructed without any delay. During the discussions, it \nwas observed that literacy among women is low, but education status has improved for the younger generation. Participation \nof women in political activities and employment opportunities is limited. However, the majority of women in the project areas \ntake an active part in family decision making. Some noted that the status of women is far better in this state than in many \nstates in the country. The women work both in the house and outside; the majority reported that they are consulted by their \nspouse and other family members for taking any decision in the family. \n \n2. Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use \nof relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n  \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nThe Project will provide women with job opportunities and will not differentiate wages between men and women particularly \nfor work of equal value. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix  12 51\n   \nIII.
