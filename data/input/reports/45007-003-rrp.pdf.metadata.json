It  proposes  an  integrated \nresponse to urgently needed basic urban services and to develop urban subcenters to catalyze \ngrowth in ger areas.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn 2012 Ulaanbaatar had a population of 1.3 million. Since the 1990s, it has had limited \nformal  extension  of  its  core,  which  largely  comprises  apartment  blocks  with  comprehensive \nutility services, including dedicated heating, water, and sanitation. However, successive waves \nof  in-migration  with  ger  tents  have  reshaped  the  city\u2019s  geography,  with  (i)  little  upgrading  or \nextension  of  basic  urban  services;  and (ii) government  policy, since  2003,  to give  each  citizen \nabout  700  square  meters  of  land.2 A  vast  low-density  peri-urban  area,  named  ger  areas,  now \nextends  around  the  city  core,  characterized  by  unplanned  settlement  of  low-  and  medium-\nincome  households  with land ownership,3 unserviced  plots,  unpaved  roads,  and poor facilities. \nThe  ger  area  population  is  estimated  at  800,000,  representing  60%  of  Ulaanbaatar  or  30%  of \nthe  country  population.  Despite  their  size,  ger  areas  have  until  recently  been  considered \ntemporary settlements. However, their official integration in the 2013 city master plan provides \nthe necessary provision to plan the redevelopment of a formal peri-urban area. \n \nLiving  conditions  in  ger  areas  are  difficult.  Poor  sanitation\u2014households  almost \n4. \nexclusively rely on open pit latrines\u2014and poor waste collection have created highly unsanitary \nliving conditions. Air pollution is among the most severe in the world, particularly during winter \nbecause  of  inadequate  household  heating  systems 4  and  unpaved  roads.  Access  to  water, \nsupplied by kiosks operated by the Ulaanbaatar Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (USUG), \nis limited.5 In 2011, most of the 40,000 people migrating to Ulaanbaatar settled in ger areas; by \n2022  the  population  is  estimated  to  grow  by  400,000  from  in-migration  and  natural  growth. \nUnder  current  situation,  the  forecasted  population  increases  is  a  serious  threat  to  the  city \nenvironment and the health of the population if the situation is not improved. \n \nLack  of  long-term  planning,  infrastructure  investment,  and  land  use  regulation  in  ger \n5. \nareas have resulted in haphazard development, limited availability of space for public facilities, \npoor  access  to  socioeconomic  services,  reduced  livelihood  opportunities,  and  insecure \n\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance financed by the Japan Fund \nfor  Poverty  Reduction.  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Preparing  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban \nServices  and  Ger  Areas  Development  Investment  Program.  Manila  (TA  7970);  and  ADB.  2011.  Technical \nAssistance for Urban Infrastructure Development and Financing. Manila (TA 7918). \n\n2  Large-scale in-migration, started in 1991 during the economic transition, has been exacerbated by recent severe \n\nwinters (dzud). During 2000\u20132010, the population of ger areas increased by about 400,000.  \n\n3  Most ger residents have two types of land ownership: right of possession or right of use. Rights of possession are \n\ngradually converted into rights of ownership subject to an administrative procedure and a small fee.  \n\n4  Most households rely on unimproved individual coal stoves. \n5  Water consumption in ger areas is low at about 10 liters per capita per day (half the recommended minimum by the \n\nWorld Health Organization in similar context). Residents pay 2\u201310 times more than non-ger area residents. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nneighborhoods.  The  lack  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  is  constraining  rational  and  dynamic \nurban development, increasing the costs of doing business and of accessing services. The city \ncore where jobs and services are concentrated now has unprecedented congestion. The service \ngap between the city core and ger areas means ger residents are poorly integrated in the urban \neconomy;  it  is  one  of  the  most  urgent  and  difficult  development  challenges.  While  various \ngovernment and development partner initiatives have significantly improved living conditions in \nger  areas,  approaches  have  generally  focused  on  specific  sectors,  failing  to  design  a \nsustainable vision and provide integrated solutions for the problems of peri-urban development.  \n \nSubcenter  upgrading. High construction cost,6 lack of urban planning, and inadequate \n6. \ninfrastructure  constrain the  upgrading  of  ger  areas. These  areas  are  predominately  residential \nwith  pockets  of  activity  nodes,  called  subcenters,  providing  commercial  and  administrative \nservices. The influence area of a subcenter varies from 30,000 to 100,000 people. Despite the \ncritical function of subcenters in overall spatial and local development, urban services have not \nbeen  substantially  improved.  The  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  limits  economic  growth  and \nincreases negative environmental impacts.  \n  \nThe program approach aims to initiate a redevelopment process in ger areas. Improving \n7. \ninfrastructure within the ger area subcenters and connectivity with the city core center is critical \nfor inclusiveness and important to facilitate the movement of people and goods, develop urban \ncorridors, and create clusters of subcenters. Better urban planning combined with a network of \ninfrastructure along priority roads will initiate a structural change of subcenter urban fabric. This \nwill  (i)  improve  residents\u2019  access  to  basic  urban  services,  public  space,  and  socioeconomic \nfacilities;  (ii)  support  local  economic  development;  (iii)  allow  residents  and  businesses  to  take \nadvantage  of  urban  economies;  and  (iv)  provide  better  housing  options.7 The  changes  in  land \nuse and higher urban density will improve water, sanitation, and heating services delivery. \n \n8. \nRoad  map.  Based  on  government  and  Municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar  (MUB)  priorities  to \nredevelop  ger  areas,  the  road  map  for  the  program  will  support  the  MUB  in  establishing  a \nnetwork of well-developed subcenters to provide jobs, housing, and economic opportunities with \nreduced  soil  and  air  pollution.  It  comprises  sequenced  investments,  municipal  reforms,  and \ncapacity  building  (policy,  planning,  and  monitoring),  with  four  strategic  objectives:  (i)  expand \nroads and basic urban services (water, sewerage, and heating) within subcenters and improve \nconnectivity  to  initiate  land  use  transformation;  (ii)  increase  economic  and  public  services \nthrough  investments  in  socioeconomic  facilities  to  meet  population  needs,  increase  urban \nfunctions,  and  encourage  job  creation;  (iii)  increase  service  provider  efficiency  by  improving \nwater  supply,  sewerage,  and  heating  service  operations;  and  (iv)  strengthen  institutions  and \ncapacity  by  improving  urban  planning  and  subcenter  development,  community  awareness, \nparticipation  and  empowerment,  service  provider  operations  and  management,  and  program \nimplementation capacity.  \n \n9. \nStrategic  context  and  sector  policy.  In  February  2013,  Parliament  approved  the \nAdjustments  to the  Ulaanbaatar  City  Urban  Development  Master  Plan  2020  and Development \nDirections 2030. The master plan produced two important outcomes: (i) integration of ger area \ndevelopment into the city master plan, and (ii) acknowledgement of the value and function of ger \narea  subcenters  as  key  elements  of  future  city  growth.8 The  MUB  is  developing  the  Ger  Area \n\n                                                \n6  Partly due to cold climate conditions and outdated construction standards. \n7  Up to 60% of subcenter households may consider exchanging their land for fully serviced apartment units. \n8  ADB  has  helped  the  MUB  introduce  a  redevelopment  strategy  for  ger  areas  through  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  [footnote  1]  and  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Ulaanbaatar  Water  and \nSanitation Services and Planning Improvement. Manila (TA 7591). \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nDevelopment  Program  and  established  a  Ger  Area  Development  Agency,  supervised  by  the \nvice mayor in charge of urban development and investment. On 30 May  2013, the city council \nresolution  No.10/38  endorsed  the  program,  subcenter  locations  under  project  1,  and \ncoordination of the investment program with the city master plan. The MUB proposed a special \npurpose  development  vehicle  (subcenter  redevelopment  authority)  to  facilitate,  supervise,  and \ncoordinate  the  redevelopment  process  of  the  selected  subcenters.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic  Development\u2019s  Street  Project  is  to  improve  road  conditions  in  Ulaanbaatar  and \nincludes  a  ger  area  component.  The  National  Development  Strategy  and \nthe  New \nReconstruction  Midterm  Program  (2008\u20132016)  constitute  the  national  framework  for  program \nimplementation.  The  program  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Mongolia; 9  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020 10  priorities,  including \nenvironmental  sustainability  and  private  sector  development;  as  well  as  the  core  themes  of \ngreen, competitive, and inclusive cities of ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.11 \n \n10. \nPolicy  dialogue  and  capacity  development.  To  supplement  the  strong  policy \nframework,  policy  dialogue  and  capacity  development  will  focus  (i)  in  communities,  on \ncommunity participation, awareness, and empowerment,12 including design and implementation \nof  the  social  and  gender  action  plan;  and  establishment  of  community  development  councils \n(CDCs)  and  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  development  councils  (SDCs);  (ii)  in \nsubcenters,  on  subcenter  upgrading, \nfor  preparing  and \nincluding \nimplementing local development plans, urban zoning regulation and construction standards, and \na  development  framework  with  a  transparent  mechanism  to  regulate  land  redevelopment \ninsuring  current residents  are integrated  in the  redevelopment  plan;  and  (iii)  in the  city,  on  the \nmaster plan through ongoing ADB technical assistance to strengthen urban planning capacity.13 \nCapacity  development  for  water  and  wastewater  utilities  will  target  (i)  improving  the  MUB  and \nUSUG management contract, (ii) defining a clearer tariff road map, and (iii) providing technical \nsupport  to  the Water  and  Sewerage  Regulatory  Commission.  For  heating,  the  focus  will  be  to \nensure financial sustainability and capacity of new and existing heating facilities operators in the \nselected subcenters and to strengthen provisions in management contracts. \n \n11. \nFinancing modality. An MFF is the proposed financing modality to promote a long-term \npartnership  between  ADB,  the  government,  and  the  MUB  to  facilitate  the  development  of \nsustainable, inclusive, and livable ger areas. The MFF will support the policy framework for the \nredevelopment  of  ger  areas,  and  provide  opportunities  for  constructive  dialogue  and  capacity \ndevelopment on city planning, policy reforms, and physical and nonphysical investments. It will \ngenerate  critical  mass,  predictability,  and  continuity  for  basic  urban  services  provision  in  ger \nareas, and enable ADB to better respond to MUB needs.  \n\ntechnical  guidance \n\n \n12. \nDevelopment  coordination.  In  preparing  the  program,  ADB  coordinated  closely  with \ndevelopment partners involved in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s urban sector. Three ADB-financed projects will \ndirectly support the program: (i) a bus rapid transit line from the city center to Selbe subcenter; 14 \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012.

Implementation  of  the  loan  is \nindependent of and will not affect implementation of the proposed program. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the program is improved living conditions in Ulaanbaatar. The outcome is \n\n(ii) support for housing and micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprise financing in ger areas \ntargeted  by  the  program;15 and  (iii)  capacity  development  technical  assistance  to  strengthen \nMUB urban planning capacity (footnote 13). \n \nB. \n \n13. \na network of livable, competitive, and inclusive subcenters in Ulaanbaatar\u2019s ger areas.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe program has four outputs: (i) roads and urban services are expanded within priority \nsubcenters,  and  connectivity  between  them  is  improved;  (ii)  economic  and  public  services  in \ntargeted  areas  are  improved;  (iii)  service  providers  become  more  efficient;  and  (iv)  institutions \nand  capacity  for  urban  development,  program  management,  and  service  delivery  are \nstrengthened. The program will be implemented over three tranches. \n \n15. \nProject 1. The first tranche will support implementation of a city master plan to develop \nSelbe  and  Bayankhoshuu  subcenters:  (i)  extend  the  sewerage  network  from  the  city  core: \ncollector  main  (6.1  kilometers  [km])  and  sewer  pipes  (2.9  km);  (ii)  within  subcenters,  develop \npriority  roads  (15  km),  water  supply  network  (18.6  km),  sewerage  network  (20  km),  district \nheating  network  (21  km),  and  five  heating  facilities  using  most  suitable  state-of-the-art \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies;  (iii)  construct  social  and  economic  facilities,  i.e.,  two \nkindergartens,  green  areas,  and  small  squares;  and  two  business  incubators,  associated  with \ntwo vocational training centers; (iv) improve USUG operations and service delivery efficiency of \nwater supply and wastewater collection; and (v) provide institutional and capacity development \nto (a) prepare detailed design and construction supervision; (b) support community participation, \nawareness,  and  SME  development;  (c)  improve  subcenter  redevelopment;  (d)  strengthen \nprogram management office (PMO) capacity; and (e) support service provider reforms. \n \n16. \nProjects  2  and  3.  The  projects  will  (i)  expand  coverage  of  similar  investments  in  \nproject  1  subcenters,  and  in  other  subcenters  in  the  northern  and  eastern  ger  areas;  and  \n(ii)  improve road connections  between  targeted subcenters.  Khaniin Material  and Market  Area \nsubcenters  are  tentatively  targeted  for  project  2,  and  Ulyastai  and  Amgalan  subcenters  for \nproject 3. Other subcenters may be considered. Heating solutions developed under tranches 2 \nand  3  will  prioritize  gas-fired  state-of-the-art  environmentally  friendly  technology,  subject  to \nsatisfactory due diligence.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  program  is  estimated  at  $320.00  million.  The  cost  of  Project  1  is \n17. \nestimated at $104.52 million (Table 1). The government has requested an MFF in an amount up \nto  $163.70  million,  or  51.2%  of  the  investment  program,  from  a  blend  of  ADB  resources:  the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  and  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  and  cofinancing  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB.

An  initial  environmental  examination \nwas  disclosed.23 It  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  is  deemed \nadequate. Environmental impacts are anticipated during construction, including dust and noise \n(arising from earthworks, transport, and handling of aggregate materials and waste), temporary \ntraffic  disturbance,  risks  to  community  and  occupational  health  and  safety,  and  impacts  of  the \nheating subcomponent operations (gas emissions, ash, and slag). Mitigation measures defined \nin  the  environmental  management  plan,  such  as  construction  site  management  and  regular \nmonitoring  of  the  project\u2019s  environmental  performance  during  construction  and  operation,  will \nreduce  anticipated  impacts  and  other  construction-related  health  and  safety  concerns  to \nacceptable levels. Subsequent projects are expected to be categorized B for environment. \n \n28. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  resettlement  framework  prepared  for  the \nprogram outlines procedures required to prepare satisfactory  land acquisition and resettlement \nplans (LARPs) and stipulates arrangements for consultation and public participation, grievance \nredress, and monitoring and evaluation. Project 1 is categorized A for resettlement. LARPs were \nprepared for Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters and disclosed to the affected people in their \nlocal  language.  Copies of  the  LARPs  are  available  in  subdistrict  and  community  offices  in  the \nproject 1 area. While road design is optimized to minimize the resettlement impact, small strips \nof land (3,800 square meters) will be acquired to widen roads in the two subcenters. The project \nwill  affect  about  12  residential  structures,  32  toilets,  21  ground  attachments,  five  gers,  and  75 \nfences; and a total of 75 households and 379 people.
