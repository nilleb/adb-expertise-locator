I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfacility of $30,000,000 to Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IIDFC) \nand  other  financial  institutions  for  the  Industrial  Energy  Efficiency  Finance  Program  in \nBangladesh. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Industrial \nEnergy Efficiency Finance Program to IIDFC, and if the Board approves the proposed loan \nfacility, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Bangladesh suffers from a chronic shortage of energy. Gas, the main source of energy, \nis insufficient to meet demand. Power supply is 29% short of demand.1 Energy shortages are \nundermining the country\u2019s competitiveness, causing an estimated two percentage point loss in \ngross domestic product growth potential. The situation is not expected to improve soon as \nproduction from existing gas fields is forecast to decline from 2019.2 Securing new sources of \nenergy (e.g., coal, liquefied natural gas) locally or abroad will take time because of the need for \npolicy decisions to bring energy tariffs up to full cost recovery at market levels. \n \n3.  Energy efficiency provides a cost-effective response to energy shortages. On the supply \nside,  existing  gas-fired  power  plants  can  be  made  more  efficient,  and  transmission  and \ndistribution losses can be reduced. On the demand side, the Government of Bangladesh has \ninitiated efficiency measures in the commercial and residential sectors.3 Industries should also \nbe a key focus for energy efficiency initiatives: directly and indirectly, industries consume about \n50% of Bangladesh\u2019s gas. They also consume oil and coal, so energy efficiency in industry can \nhelp reduce the country\u2019s carbon emissions.  \n \n4.  The proposed finance program will promote energy efficiency investments in industry \nthrough a loan facility to selected financial institutions. These financial institutions will onlend the \nproceeds to eligible energy efficiency projects in seven industries: brick making, textiles, steel, \ncement, ceramics, chemicals, and agri-industries. These industries have large energy saving \npotential and energy efficiency improvement technologies are readily identifiable (either retrofits \nof existing systems or new systems). A GTZ\u2013World Bank report4 showed that energy efficiency \nprojects in textiles, steel, and chemicals have the greatest carbon emission reduction potential \nper dollar invested by comparing 16 pilot studies across industries.5 \n \n5.  IIDFC  will  be  the  first  participating  financial  institution  in  the  finance  program.  In \nSeptember 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) organized a workshop on Improving the \nRegional Distribution of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Projects in Asia and the Pacific \nat ADB\u2019s headquarters. The workshop aimed at increasing the number of CDM projects in \ncountries  currently  hosting  fewer  than  10  registered  CDM  projects.  IIDFC  was  invited  to \nparticipate as a representative from Bangladesh. In December 2010, IIDFC requested ADB\u2019s \nassistance for improving kiln efficiency in the brick-making industry in Bangladesh. \n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Power Development Board. 2010.

Bangladesh Roadmap for Energy Efficiency Improvements and Demand Side \nManagement. Dhaka (September). \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n \n6.  IIDFC has experience and expertise in industrial energy efficiency, particularly in the \nbrick-making industry. It has been involved in promoting hybrid Hoffman kiln (HHK) projects \nsince 2006. HHKs are 50% more energy efficient than the brick kilns traditionally used in \nBangladesh  (footnote  5).  In  2009,  the  company  signed  an  emission  reduction  purchase \nagreement with the World Bank and the Government of Denmark for 16 HHK projects. IIDFC \nacts as the CDM bundling agent, while providing debt financing to some projects. It has also \nencouraged other financial institutions to finance HHK projects, and established a dedicated \nenergy efficiency and carbon finance team in 2009. \n \n7.  Other participating financial institutions are likely to include 1\u20133 private sector banks or \nnonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) in Bangladesh. Participating financial institutions will be \nselected based on six criteria: (i) satisfactory integrity due diligence; (ii) compliance with all \nprudential ratios; (iii) credit strength above industry average; (iv) operating policies, guidelines, \nand systems in loan origination, credit assessment, loan administration, loan collection, and \nenforcement;  (v)  commitment  to  investing  in  energy  efficiency  and  adequate  staffing, \nmanagement, and technical capacity to implement the finance program; and (vi) commitment to \nmanaging environmental and social impacts associated with the finance program. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n8.  IIDFC is a leading NBFI in Bangladesh.6 It was established in 2000 to boost investment \nin the industry and infrastructure sectors by providing long-term finance. As of December 2010, \nit had an asset base of $156.9 million and net worth of $14.4 million. IIDFC\u2019s local credit rating \nis AA\u2013, which corresponds to institutions having very strong capacity to meet their financial \ncommitments and carrying very low credit risk in the local context.7 \n \n9.  IIDFC  offers  selected  financial  services,  including  term  lending,  lease  finance, \nsyndication services, securities trading services, and margin loans. Its clients mainly comprise \nlarge  industrial  groups,  but  also  include  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  retail \ncustomers (term deposits, brokerage services). Revenues from traditional lending and leasing \nhave displayed solid growth (35% per year on average during 2008\u20132010), and fee-based \nrevenues have grown even faster (248%). \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n10.  IIDFC was founded by 14 Bangladesh financial institutions\u2014eight private sector banks, \nthree private sector insurance companies and three state-owned financial institutions (each \nholding approximately 6.9% of equity)\u2014and one individual, Matiul Islam (with approximately \n3.0%).  The  14  financial  institution  shareholders  provide  IIDFC  with  banking  and  financial \nexpertise and a good network, as well as access to finance in case of unexpected needs. The \naverage  long-term  local  credit rating  of the  financial  institution  shareholders  is  between  A \n(strong) and AA (very strong). Six out of the eight private sector shareholder banks have already \nbeen accepted as participants in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. \n \n                                                \n6  IIDFC ranks among the top three Bangladesh NBFIs, measured by 2010 total revenues. \n7  Two local rating agencies assigned an AA\u2013 rating to IIDFC: National Credit Ratings (NCR) in July 2011 and Credit \nRating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB) in October 2009. ", "  3 \n11.  IIDFC\u2019s  board  of  directors  consists  of  highly  qualified  individuals.  Matiul  Islam,  the \ncompany chair, is a former finance secretary of the Government of Bangladesh, and also served \nat the World Bank and the United Nations. He founded several financial institutions before \nIIDFC, including the AB Bank, now one of the leading private banks in Bangladesh. All other \nboard members are top executives of the institutions they represent. \n \n2.  Management \n12.  IIDFC\u2019s core management includes managing director A. Khan, additional managing \ndirector K. Rahman, head of credit R. Islam, and chief financial officer S. Ahamed, having on \naverage 30 years banking experience. All bring vast experience in Bangladesh\u2019s commercial \nbanking sector. A. Khan also worked at Bangladesh Bank (central bank and finance sector \nregulator) where he gained experience in policy formulation and bank supervision.  \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n13.  IIDFC is governed by its board of directors. The management team is responsible for \nday-to-day  operations  but  needs  board  approval  for  all  important  decisions.  The  board  is \nsupported by seven committees, including the audit committee, the credit risk management \ncommittee, the asset liability management committee, and the central compliance unit. \n \n14.  IIDFC\u2019s risk management policies incorporate banking best practices. The principal risks \nof proposed transactions are summarized through a scoring system. All credit proposals are \nreviewed  by  an  independent  credit  risk  department  before  submission  to  the  credit  risk \nmanagement committee and, if required, to the board of directors. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n15.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to the finance program will consist of two components: (i) a \n$30 million loan facility to be disbursed to participating financial institutions (IIDFC and other \nparticipating financial institutions to be selected) for them to onlend to eligible industrial energy \nefficiency projects, and (ii) a $1.5 million TA to identify bankable energy efficiency projects in \ntarget industries other than brick making.8 \n \n16.  While ADB\u2019s loan facility is proposed to be limited to $30 million, the demand for energy \nefficiency funding arising from the projects identified through the finance program may be \nhigher. Participating financial institutions and other local or international financial institutions \nmay  provide  cofinancing  to  the  identified  projects.  Hence,  it  is  expected  that  the  finance \nprogram could result in up to $100 million of industrial energy efficiency investments (assuming \n$30 million in cofinancing and $40 million in equity contribution from the industrial sponsors). \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  To be eligible to receive a loan from a participating financial institution, a potential \nenergy efficiency project in a target industry will need to demonstrate the following: \n                                                \n8  The brick-making industry has not been included in the TA scope as energy efficiency projects using the proven \nHHK technology have already been implemented (four of them financed by IIDFC) and can be replicated. \n ", "4 \n(i)  An energy audit and feasibility study have been prepared by an internationally \nrecognized expert, validating either (a) at least 20% energy savings per unit \nproduced with the new technology compared to the old technology, or (b) an \ninvestment payback from savings on energy costs within 7 years. \n(ii)  The project\u2019s sponsor has a relevant industry track record, integrity, and financial \nstrength (existing profitable business and/or ability to provide the required equity \nand support to the project). \n(iii)  All  applicable  national  environmental  requirements  (including  permits  and \nemission/discharge standards) have been met, or will be met within a reasonable \ntime frame based on a corrective action plan. \n(iv)  The debt\u2013equity ratio after financing is 3:1 at most. \n(v)  The  loan  is  within  the  financial  institution\u2019s  single  obligor  and  single  sector \nexposure limits. \n \n18.  The  finance  program  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Where ADB provides funds to an intermediary institution to be \nonlent to borrowers for the partial financing of subprojects, procurement is generally undertaken \nby  the  respective  borrowers  \u2015in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB\u2016  (ADB  Procurement  Guidelines,  clause  3.12).  In \naddition, the ADB loan documentation will require goods to be procured from ADB member \ncountries. \n \n19.  Loan documentation will also include covenants requiring IIDFC and other participating \nfinancial institutions to provide financial reports and annual monitoring reports about their loans \nto eligible projects. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB\u2019s financing is long-tenor, which is not readily available in Bangladesh given liquidity \nconstraints  in  the  banking  sector.  The  finance  program  will  help  catalyze  further  private \ninvestment. Through the TA, ADB will assist industries in identifying commercially viable energy \nefficiency projects. ADB will also help participating financial institutions to establish or improve \nESMS,  promoting  adoption  of  safeguards  best  practices  in  Bangladesh.  Finally,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance could catalyze cofinancing from international commercial banks, other international \nfinance institutions, or donor countries. \n \nD.  Technical Assistance \n21.  Nonsovereign TA of $1.5 million for the Industrial Energy Efficiency Finance Program is \nproposed to be provided as a reimbursable advance to IIDFC from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  advance  will  be  used  to  identify  bankable  energy  efficiency \nprojects  in  target  industries  other  than  brick  making.  A  consulting  firm  that  includes  both \ninternational and local engineers will be hired according to ADB\u2019s guidelines. The firm will help \nidentify potential projects within the client portfolios of participating financial institutions. It will \nthen prepare energy audits and feasibility studies for these projects. The TA funds will be \nreimbursable to ADB if and to the extent that the projects identified receive financing from the \nparticipating financial institutions using ADB financing. The consultant will organize workshops ", "  5 \nfor the participating financial institutions to ensure their staff understand the results of the \nstudies and know how to translate the studies into bankable projects.9 \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n22.  The finance program is expected to have the following development impacts: (i) energy \nsavings  contributing  to  reducing  Bangladesh\u2019s  energy  supply\u2013demand  gap  and  mitigating \nclimate change, (ii) demonstrating that industrial energy efficiency solutions are commercially \nviable, and (iii) developing local energy efficiency expertise within the finance sector and among \ntechnical consultants and energy efficiency solution providers. \n \n2.  Outcome \n23.  The  finance  program\u2019s  expected  outcome  will  be  greater  efficiency  in  the  financed \nindustrial projects, resulting in energy savings and carbon emission reduction. Industries are \nexpected  to  reduce  their  gas,  coal,  and  power  consumption  by  at  least  20%  per  unit  of \nproduction, contributing to energy savings equivalent to at least 350 gigawatt-hours per year by \n2015 and to a reduction in carbon emissions of at least 150,000 tons per year by 2015. More \nefficient  industrial  processes  can  also  reduce  air  pollution  and  improve  labor  conditions, \nparticularly in the brick-making industry.10 \n \n3.  Outputs \n24.  The finance program\u2019s outputs will be (i) the completion of industrial energy efficiency \nprojects expected to represent an aggregate investment of at least $50 million (and up to $100 \nmillion) by 2014, and (ii) the implementation of an ESMS by all participating financial institutions. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n25.  The promotion of energy efficiency is a key objective under ADB's Strategy 2020.11 \nEnergy efficiency is mentioned under both the infrastructure (energy) and the  environment \n(climate change) core areas of operations. Strategy 2020 estimated the annual investment \nneeds for energy efficiency in Asia and the Pacific at $14 billion over the 2009\u20132018 period. \nEnergy efficiency is also an objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh.12 \n \n                                                \n9  Technical Assistance: Industrial Energy Efficiency Finance Program (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2) includes details on the TA\u2019s objectives, activities, budget, implementation arrangements, and the \nconsulting firm\u2019s terms of reference. \n10 IIDFC. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "6 \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n26.  The finance program is aligned with energy and finance sector strategies. According to \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy, \u2015harnessing energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to meet \nenergy demand, while addressing global warming.\u201613 In particular, the Energy Policy calls for \nADB to expand its energy efficiency operations \u2015in the industry sector by collaborating with \nindustry associations, domestic banks, and specialized energy efficiency agencies and energy \nservice companies.\u2016 As such, climate change finance has been elevated as a new area of focus \nin ADB\u2019s private sector operations since 2010.14 Moreover, ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational \nPlan recommends that financial intermediation (credit line) operations should be combined with \neffective TA to the financial intermediaries.15  \n \n27.  The  finance  program  is  consistent  with  other  ADB  operations  in  Bangladesh.  The \npromotion  of  demand-side  energy  efficiency  in  the  industry  sector  will  complement  ADB\u2019s \nsupply-side assistance to improve efficiency in the power sector.16 Sovereign assistance to the \nbrick-making industry is also being considered and will complement and create synergies with \nthe finance program. The proposed sovereign assistance will address the issue of immediate \nemission reduction and the longer-term modernization of the sector. It will include a $50 million \nloan facility and $3 million of TA.17 The loan facility would offer funds at rates that are conducive \nto promote development of the brick-making industry. The TA will provide policy support to \nensure enforcement of the ban on inefficient brick kilns and will contribute to creating awareness \nof efficient brick kiln technologies, including HHK, which will thus benefit the finance program.18 \n \n28.  The  finance  program  can  also  benefit  from  policy  and  tariff  reforms  that  other \ndevelopment agencies are promoting. German development cooperation through GIZ19 has \nbeen providing policy support to prepare a draft Energy Conservation Act, which in particular \nwould  mandate  the  replacement  of  highly  inefficient  technologies.20 To  reduce  the  budget \ndeficit, the International Monetary Fund is considering including an increase in energy prices \nthrough lower subsidies as one of the conditions to a $1 billion sovereign loan currently under \ndiscussion.21 Although these reforms may take time to materialize, they would provide further \nimpetus to the adoption of energy efficiency solutions across sectors. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009.

The policy and advisory TA funds \ncould potentially be combined with those from the development partners (World Bank and  United Nations \nDevelopment Programme) for the possible establishment of a brick technical information center as a one-stop \nshop for all industry development needs. \n19 Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit. \n20 ADB. 2011.

The finance program\u2019s design incorporates key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous \nenergy efficiency interventions. A recent draft evaluation knowledge brief concludes that energy \nefficiency in industry and buildings should be promoted through commercial financing, and in \nparticular through lines of credit dedicated to financing projects that qualify as energy efficiency \ninvestments.22 Lines of credit should be combined with TA to support the origination of energy \nefficiency  projects  and  to  help  financial  intermediaries  understand  the  bankability  of  these \nprojects.  ADB\u2019s  recent  nonsovereign  assistance  to  Indonesia  Eximbank  included  capacity \nbuilding TA: this finance program\u2019s design greatly benefited from the precedent.23 The draft \nevaluation  knowledge  brief  also  highlights  the  importance  of  identifying  \u2015local  financial \nintermediaries  that  are  interested  in  energy  efficiency  lending\u2016  and  of  letting  the  financial \nintermediary \u2015identify, appraise, and approve a subloan itself, without further approvals from any \ngovernment  body  or  a  development  partner\u2016  (footnote  22).  Finally,  energy  efficiency \ninterventions need not be big and broad to start with; at times it is best to start with small, \nnarrowly focused programs and to increase the scope and sophistication over time. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n30.  The  finance  program  is  classified  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The finance program's potential environment \nand social impacts, the risks associated with IIDFC\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and \nIIDFC\u2019s commitment to and capacity for environmental management have been assessed. \nSimilar due diligence will be conducted on other participating financial institutions. IIDFC and the \nother participating financial institutions will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited activities list, ensure that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with \nADB Safeguards and Policy Statement (2009), and establish and maintain appropriate ESMSs, \neach satisfactory to ADB, before disbursement for the financing of investments. An ESMS \nframework has been prepared to guide participating financial institutions in developing an ESMS \nto address impacts and risks.24 The participating institutions\u2019 ESMS will include arrangements to \ncomply with national labor laws and ADB Social Protection Strategy (2001) to ensure adherence \nto core labor standards. As industries become more efficient, they will also become more \ncompetitive and create jobs. The finance program will have some gender benefits as women \nrepresent the great majority of workers in light industries such as textiles and garments, agri-\nbusiness, and brick making. \n \nB.
