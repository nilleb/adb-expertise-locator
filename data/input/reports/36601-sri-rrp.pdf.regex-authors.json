Interventions  involve  the  rehabilitation  of  small-scale \nAssessment  community  facilities,  schools,  rural  and  district  hospitals,  rural \nelectrification,  and  shelter  reconstruction  at  locations  and  sites \npreviously  or  currently  used  for  the  same  or  similar  purposes  and \nunlikely to generate any significant environmental impact. All subprojects \nwill  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an  environmental  checklist \nduring formulation. Category A subprojects will not be financed. \n   \nProject Description  The North East Community Restoration and Development (NECORD) \nProject  II  continues  the  government\u2019s  rehabilitation  program  for  the \nconflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces.  Post-\nconflict rehabilitation will address basic needs in the conflict-affected \nareas  through  health,  education,  irrigation,  agriculture,  community \ndevelopment,  institutional  infrastructure,  and  income-generation \nsubprojects.  \n   \nRationale  In May 2009, the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil \nEelam and gained full control of the Northern province. However, the \nconflict  displaced  more  than  290,000  people  from  districts  in  the \nNorthern province. These internally displaced persons (IDPs), who were \nhoused in 32 special welfare centers, were in addition to the more than \n150,000 people who were displaced before the renewed outbreak of \nfighting in 2006 and who are living with friends and relatives and in \nwelfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya districts. About 65% of \nthe recent IDPs living in welfare centers have been relocated to their \noriginal places of residence, or with host families (including friends and \nrelatives) by the end of January 2010. The rest are expected to be \nresettled by about mid-2010 as demining progresses.  \n \n  The government initiated a needs assessment in the second quarter of \n2009  by  interdepartmental  teams  from  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments.  The  needs  assessment  identified  two  programs  for \nimmediate rehabilitation and medium-term reconstruction: (i) the 180-\nday  program,  and  (ii)  the  medium-term  (3  years)  rehabilitation  and ", "ii \ndevelopment needs program. The 180-day program is concentrating on \nrepairing the most urgently needed partially damaged community and \nadministrative infrastructure, while the medium-term program will focus \non  rebuilding  the  destroyed  larger  infrastructure  needed  to  support \nmedium- to longer-term development and livelihood needs. An estimated \n$800 million is required for the 180-day program. About $2,680 million is \nneeded to meet the medium-term requirements. Main sectors include \nhousing  (more  than  $317  million);  electricity  ($152  million);  roads \n($949 million);  transport  ($238  million);  agriculture,  fisheries,  and \nlivestock  (more  than  $186  million);  and  education  (more  than  $90 \nmillion). \n   \nImpact and  The  main  objective  of  NECORD  II  is  to  rapidly  improve  the  living \nOutcome  conditions  and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the \nconflict-affected  areas  of  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  by \nrestoring basic social infrastructure, community and public services, and \nlivelihoods. NECORD II will also support and augment the government\u2019s \nrehabilitation and relief efforts under way in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \n  NECORD  II  rehabilitation  subprojects  will  further  community \ndevelopment,  rehabilitate  access  roads,  develop  institutional \ninfrastructure, and restore basic infrastructure. Given the recent increase \nin  construction  activity  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces,  an \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  carried  out  for  construction \nworkers and returnees.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The revised estimated total cost is $78.9 million equivalent, including \ntaxes, duties, and interest during implementation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank      52.8 66.9\n   Asian Development Fund grant      14.0 17.7\n   Asian Development Fund loan  16.2  22.7  38.8 49.2\nGovernment of Sri Lanka    12.9  12.9 16.4\nGovernment of Australia        7.3 9.2\nGovernment of Sweden      5.9 7.5\nTotal       78.9 100.0\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nSupplementary  The government has requested a supplementary loan of $12.8 million \nLoan Amount and  from the Asian Development Fund for the unmet basic and urgent needs \nTerms  of the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces. The loan will \nhave  a  40-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  with \nrepayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the \ngrace period and 4% a year thereafter. The terms and conditions of the \nloan will be as set forth in the loan agreement presented to the Board.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2012  \nUtilization   ", "    iii\n   \nImplementation  NECORD  II  will  be  implemented  through  project  management  units \nArrangements  already established under the ongoing loan.  \n \n  A national project coordination committee chaired by the Secretary of \nthe  Ministry  of  Nation  Building  and  Estate  Infrastructure  will  provide \noversight and coordination. Members will come from the presidential \ntask  force  for  rebuilding  the  Northern  province;  other  ministries, \ndepartments,  and  agencies  responsible  for  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation; the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the chief secretaries \nof the Northern and Eastern provincial councils; project director; and \nothers as appropriate. The committee will meet at least quarterly and \noversee project coordination and implementation at the national level.  \n \n  To  ensure  beneficiary  participation  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation, sector subprojects will generally be prepared for and \napproved by a provincial project coordination committee. The Northern \nand  Eastern  provincial  councils  currently  perform  this  function \neffectively.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand the government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB. For civil \nworks contracts with estimated values more than $3 million, procurement \nwill be in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures. \nFor contracts with estimated values of $3 million or less, procurement \nwill  be  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB, using single-stage, two-envelope procedures where \nrelevant, and bidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \n  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding when the estimated cost is more than $500,000 \nequivalent and through national competitive bidding when the estimated \ncost  is  $500,000  equivalent  or  less.  Goods  and  works  valued  at \n$100,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  under  shopping \nprocedures. Goods costing less than $10,000 equivalent may be directly \npurchased from a supplier.  \n   \nConsulting  The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nServices  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011  \nCompletion Date \n   \nProject Benefits  Because of the many years of conflict, poverty levels in the conflict-\nand Beneficiaries  affected  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces  are  estimated  to  be  about \n37%\u2014much higher than in the rest of the country, although there are \ngaps in government surveys for much of the area.  \n \n ", "iv \n  The project will help to meet the urgent basic needs of about 1.5 million \npeople,  including  a  significant  number  of  physically  disabled  people, \nhouseholds headed by women, and children. By restoring sectors that \nform the backbone of the economy in affected areas, the subprojects will \nhelp to rebuild communities and stabilize the economic base of the local \npopulations, helping them to move from dependence on government \nsupport toward sustainable livelihoods.  \n   \nAssumptions,  The  design  of  NECORD  II  incorporates  safeguards  to  improve  and \nRisks, and  strengthen governance and the institutional capacity of the executing \nMitigation  agencies,  the  implementing  agencies,  and  the  project  management \nMeasures  units.  \n \n  Mines and unexploded ordinance are the main risks in the project areas. \nThe government is coordinating with demining agencies to ensure that \nthe areas where people are resettling, including subproject sites, are \nprioritized. District secretaries are responsible for coordinating demining \nat the ground level, and the executing agency is responsible at the \nnational level. \n \n  Price  escalation  is  another  risk.  An  increase  in  the  demand  for \nconstruction materials, which are already in short supply, could drive up \nprices and affect the amount of reconstruction that can be carried out in \nthe area. Based on the lessons after the tsunami, ADB has raised the \nissue with the government. Studies are under way to identify adequate \nsites for supply of construction materials and to obtain all necessary \nstatutory permits to facilitate the construction industry. \n \n ", " \n I.   THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development Project (NECORD) II.1 \n \nII.   THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.   Project Rationale \n \n2.  Approved on 14 April 2005, NECORD II was designed to assist the Government of Sri \nLanka with its rehabilitation program for the conflict-affected areas of the Northern and Eastern \nprovinces. The project was processed concurrently with the Tsunami-Affected Areas Rebuilding \nProject2 to ensure that people affected by both the conflict and the December 2004 tsunami would \nbenefit equally since they are in the same districts. Post-conflict rehabilitation seeks to address \nbasic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education,  irrigation,  agriculture, \ncommunity development, institutional infrastructure, and income-generation subprojects. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n3.  The main objective of NECORD II is to help meet basic human needs and improve living \nconditions rapidly in conflict-affected areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces by restoring \nbasic social infrastructure, community and public services, and livelihoods. NECORD II is also \nsupporting  rehabilitation  and  relief  efforts  under  way  in  conflict-affected  areas.  Rehabilitation \nsubprojects under NECORD II will further community development, rehabilitate access roads, \ndevelop institutional infrastructure, and restore basic infrastructure. Given the recent increase in \nconstruction activity in the Northern and Eastern provinces, an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign will \nbe carried out for construction workers and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The project design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.   Original Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n4.  As shown in Appendix 2, NECORD II was financed by an Asian Development Fund (ADF) \nloan of SDR16.91 million ($26.0 million at the time of approval) together with an ADF grant of \n$14.0 million and a cofinancing grant from the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency (Sida) of SKr40 million ($5.9 million). The government's contribution for taxes and duties is \n$9.1 million. The loan and grants became effective on 28 July 2005, and the closing date for \nNECORD II is currently 30 March 2010. \n \nD.   Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n \n5.  NECORD II has performed satisfactorily in meeting its objectives. Between 2006 and May \n2009,  renewed  conflict  disrupted  the  project.  After  the  government  gained  full  control  of  the \nEastern province in mid-2007, the working environment in its districts improved. The government \nintroduced  a  180-day  program  to  rehabilitate  the  essential  basic  infrastructure  and  facilitate \nresettlement of IDPs in the Eastern province. Most IDPs in the province\u2014about 150,000\u2014were \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The project management unit (PMU) for NECORD II has accelerated project \nimplementation in districts in the Eastern province, and all the current subprojects in those districts \nare scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2010.  \n \n6.  Following the resurgence of the conflict, the government imposed access and security \nrestrictions in districts of the Northern province, mainly in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, in 2006. \nSubprojects have and are being implemented in parts of Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya districts, \nwhere  there  is  access  and  no  security  restrictions.  Since  2008,  no  subprojects  involving \nreconstruction activities that require cement and steel (being bulk items and difficult to transport) \nhave been approved in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts, where the conflict was most severe. \nHowever, small community-based activities, such as training and reconstruction of village gravel \nroads, were undertaken under both NECORD II and other Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects \nto remain engaged with the people of the area. The project performance assessments as of \nNovember 2009 are in Appendix 3.  \n \n7.  In May 2009, the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and gained full \ncontrol of the Northern province.3 By the end of the war, about 290,000 IDPs from districts in the \nNorthern province were housed in 32 special welfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya. An \nadditional 150,000 IDPs who had been displaced before the outbreak of the 2006 conflict are still \nliving with friends and relatives and in welfare centers in Jaffna, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya \ndistricts.  \n \n8.  On 1 July 2009, the government launched a 180-day plan4 for emergency rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of public administration and provision of basic human needs related infrastructure \nand services to facilitate resettlement of IDPs and restart their livelihoods.By mid-January 2010, \n \nabout 190,000 of the IDPs who had been housed in the Vavuniya welfare camps since May 2009 \nhad returned to their original places of residence or temporary transit centers closer to their original \nplaces of residence, or were staying with host families (including friends and relatives).5 This is \nbroadly in line with the government target to resettle a majority of these people in their original \nplaces of residence by the end of January 2010. Returnees are engaging in reconstruction of their \nhomes; cleaning the village access roads and common facilities such as wells and irrigation \ncanals; and restarting livelihoods such as agriculture, fishing, small business, and trading. While \nabout 100,000 IDPs remain in the main welfare centers, they have been able to move in and out of \nthe centers for extended periods since 1 December 2009. These remaining IDPs are expected to \nbe resettled in the first half of 2010, after land mines have been cleared.  \n \n9.  To help meet basic human needs and the most urgent community and social infrastructure \nneeds of the returning IDPs, as identified by the 180-day program, the government requested ADB \nand other development partners to (i) assist with restarting stalled projects in the conflict-affected \nareas, (ii) provide additional assistance through surplus funds and loan savings from the existing \nportfolio, and (iii) provide additional emergency financing. In response, NECORD II has supported \nthe 180-day program, providing $1 million for the most urgently needed repairs to some of the \ndamaged basic infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and administrative facilities. In December \n2009, the Government of Australia through the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID) provided grant cofinancing of A$8 million ($7.3 million) to NECORD II.6 This cofinancing \n                                                 \n3  Northern province comprises Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaittivu, and Vavuniya districts.  \n4  The resettlement plan is part of the Wadakkil Wasantham Development Program - Plan of Action for Implementation of \n180 Days Crash Program in the Northern Region. This program is also called the \"Northern Reawakening.\" \n5  As per United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees weekly bulletins.  \n6  The governments of Sri Lanka and Australia have agreed to use the grant to assist IDPs in resuming their livelihoods \nupon returning to their original places of residence. The A$20 million grant is divided between ADB (A$8 million) and ", "    3\nwill help nearly 35,000 families resume their livelihoods under the government's unified assistance \nscheme (UAS), which is open to every returning IDP. Under the UAS, a family is entitled to \nSLRs25,000 as a livelihood or resettlement grant and SLRs325,000 as housing grant after they \nsettle in their original place of residence. The method of selecting the beneficiaries is a transparent \nand well documented, and the payment is only through a bank account opened on behalf of the \nbeneficiary. The grant is to buy basic kitchen utensils, agricultural implements, seeds, school \nbooks or uniforms, livestock, roofing and building materials, or any other activity that will enable the \nIDPs to restart their lives. AusAID is also providing funding to the World Bank supported work-fare \nscheme under the Emergency Northern Recovery Project (ENREP),7 which is similar to the UAS \nscheme. On average, each family will receive SLRs25,000.  \n \n10.  Review missions in 2009 observed that some of the infrastructure built or rehabilitated by \nthe government and its development partners since 2001 has been partially damaged. In most \ncases, the assets have not been destroyed and can be repaired quickly. Interdepartmental teams \nfrom  the  central  and  provincial  governments  conducted  needs  assessments  for  the  180-day \nprogram, as well as the medium-term (3 years) rehabilitation and development of the former \nconflict-affected areas, in the second quarter of 2009. The 180-day program is concentrating \nmainly on repairing the most urgently needed and partially damaged community infrastructure, \nwhile the medium-term program will focus on rebuilding the destroyed larger infrastructure needed \nto support medium- to longer-term development and livelihood needs. Appendix 4 summarizes the \nmedium-term  requirement  based  on  the  needs  assessment.  An  estimated  $2,680  million  is \nrequired to meet the medium-term requirements. The main sectors that require support include \nhousing  (more  than  $317  million);  power  ($152  million);  roads  ($949 million);  transport  ($238 \nmillion); agriculture, fisheries, and livestock (more than $186 million); and education (more than \n$90 million).  \n  \n11.  As of 31 December 2009, $25.88 million (99.95%) of the original ADF loan component had \nbeen committed. The ADF grant and the Sida grant had been fully committed. The disbursements \nwere as follows: $22.47 million (86.77%) for the ADF loan, $13.06 million (93.3%) for the ADF \ngrant, and $4.77 million (82.2%) for the Sida grant. Of the 593 subprojects identified, more than \n500 subprojects were completed and handed over to the beneficiaries. The rest of the subprojects \nare progressing satisfactorily and will be completed by March 2010 (the current loan closing date).  \n \n12.  NECORD II is complying with key project covenants, as detailed in Appendix 5. One key \ncovenant includes filling vacancies, especially in the education and health sectors where NECORD \nII had the most subprojects. Based on the observations during recent ADB review missions, \nteachers  and  medical  staff  vacancies  are  being  filled  in  all  the  rural  facilities  created  under \nNECORD  II.  Specific  subprojects  have  been  included  in  the  ongoing  loan  to  train  staff  in \nanticipation of the future requirements.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Proposed Changes \n \n13.  Given the still urgent needs and substantial costs involved in helping resettled IDPs return \nto a normal life in an area badly affected by war, the government requested ADB to identify loan \n                                                                                                                                                               \nWorld Bank (A$12 million). The funding to ADB will be managed through NECORD II, while the World Bank's funding \nwill be managed through its Emergency Northern Recovery Project for $65 million approved on 17 December 2009.  \n7  World Bank. 2009. International Development Association Project Paper on a Proposed Emergency Recovery Credit in \nthe Amount of SDR40.9 million (US$65 million equivalent) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nEmergency Northern Recovery Project (ENREP). Washington, DC. \n ", "4 \nsavings that could be used as supplementary financing to NECORD II. Based on portfolio review \nmissions in 2009, ADB identified loan savings and surpluses totaling SDR8.15 million ($12.77 \nmillion) of ADF that could be allocated to NECORD II.8 Appendix 6 provides details of the proposed \nloans from which the funds will be reallocated to NECORD II. \n \n14.  Through  this  proposed  supplementary  loan  to  NECORD  II,  ADB  will  support  the \ngovernment's efforts to meet basic human needs, particularly of the returning IDPs, and assist \nthem in restarting their livelihood activities through the reconstruction of essential community and \nsocial infrastructure damaged by the conflict. Areas where the conflict was heavy since 2006 will \nbe prioritized. These areas include parts of Jaffna, Mannar, and Vavuniya, and all of Kilinochchi \nand Mullaitivu districts. The emphasis will be on helping to reestablish the civil administration, basic \nhealth care and education services as well as support for rural electrification schemes, minor \naccess roads, minor irrigation, community water supply, and vocational and skills training for \nlivelihood development. Using existing PMUs and institutional resources of the NECORD II will \nprovide a quick, effective, and efficient way to meet essential needs and deliver services to \nreturning IDPs using the proposed additional funds.  \n \nB.   Impact on the Project \n \n15.  The proposed supplementary financing will directly benefit the returning IDPs and host \ncommunities,  and  assist  in  rehabilitating,  reconstructing,  and  developing  areas  affected  by \ndecades of conflict. The project design incorporates opportunities to enhance participation of the \nlocal community and local staff in decision making, and aims to build local capacity. Equity and \nconflict sensitivity will be pursued through (i) the selection of subprojects that ensure an ethnic \nbalance,  reflecting  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  affected  areas;  (ii)  geographical  balance; \n(iii) consultation  with  affected  stakeholders  regarding  the  final  choice  of  subprojects;  and \n(iv) livelihood recovery activities that are undertaken close to the affected populations, with their \nactive involvement as stakeholders in the process. Details of the proposed sector scope and \nselection criteria, including the estimated costs, are in Appendix 7. The expanded scope of the \nNECORD II will enhance the project\u2019s impact, outcome, and outputs. The revised design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 8. Appendix 9 provides details of the grievance and dispute \nprevention and settlement mechanisms designed to minimize tensions between communities.  \n \nC.   Rationale \n \n16.  Since the conflict ended in 2009, ADB has worked with the government to find ways to \nsupport urgent rehabilitation through ongoing projects in the conflict-affected areas. These projects \ninclude (i) NECORD II (repairing damaged schools, hospitals, and administrative buildings; and \nproviding farm tractors to farmers societies to restart agriculture); (ii) the Conflict-Affected Areas \nRebuilding Project9 (expediting the ongoing road works in Northern province and purchasing a \nmotor  launch  to  connect  the  islands  of  Jaffna  district  with  Jaffna  peninsula;  and  restarting \ninstallation  of  medium-voltage  and  rural  electrification  schemes,  especially  in  Kilinochchi  and \n                                                 \n8  Loan savings identified totaled SDR15.41 million ($24.17 million) from ADF and $3.63 million from ordinary capital \nresources. However, to maintain balanced support between Northern and Eastern provinces and to ensure that critical \nbasic needs in Eastern province are also met, the government also requested that a portion of the surplus funds, about \n$13 million, be allocated as supplementary financing to the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water \nSupply and Sanitation Project to complete the head works and water treatment plant in the Muttur water supply \nscheme in Eastern province. The scheme will serve an area resettled by IDPs and directly benefit about 55,000 \npeople. The supplementary financing for the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and \nSanitation Project is being processed separately on a non-emergency basis.  \n9 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Conflict-Affected Areas Rebuilding Project. Manila (Loan 2043-SRI[SF]). ", "    5\nMullaitivu districts); and (iii) the Secondary Education and Modernization Project II10 and Education \nfor Knowledge Society Project11 (using loan savings of nearly $5 million from within these loans to \nprovide funds to nearly 500 schools in the Northern province to undertake urgent repairs of school \nbuildings,  and  rehabilitation  of  computer  and  science  labs).  Further,  ADB  is  processing  an \nemergency assistance loan for $150 million for the Northern province for Board consideration in \nMarch 2010, which will complement these initiatives and the proposed supplementary financing of \nNECORD II by focusing on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of priority infrastructure in the \nconflict-affected districts. \n \n17.  The  proposed  reallocation  meets  the  policy  criteria  and  eligibility  requirements  for \nsupplementary financing, as modified to ensure expedited processing as specified under the ADB\u2019s \nDisaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004).  Since  NECORD  II  was  processed  as  an \nemergency loan, emphasizing least-cost, high-impact, and rapid solutions for rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, financial and economic analyses were not performed. The proposed reallocated \namount will be used for subprojects applying the same selection criteria as the original assistance, \nand the supplementary financing is also being processed under ADB's disaster and emergency \npolicy. As such, additional financial and economic analyses are not required.  \n  \nD.   Safeguards \n \n18.  NECORD II was classified as environmental category B, which is not changed with this \nsupplementary financing. As indicated in the original agreement, category A subprojects will not be \nfinanced under this proposed supplementary financing. An environmental assessment and review \nframework  in  line  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is  in  Appendix  10.12 Most  of  the \nsubprojects approved under NECORD II involved the rehabilitation of old or conflict-damaged \ninfrastructure. All subproject proposals have been reviewed against the checklist developed for \nsocial and environment assessments, and they met the criteria. As given in the environmental \nassessment and review framework, the PMU verifies the information before recommending the \nsubproject for approval to the provincial project coordination committee. Where necessary, the \nPMU requests additional information before the subproject is approved for implementation. Since \nmost of the subprojects involved the rehabilitation or rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, they did \nnot require the acquisition of land or relocation of people. If any land acquisition (temporary or \npermanent) is involved, a resettlement plan will be prepared for the subproject, as provided for in \nthe resettlement framework attached in Appendix 11. \n \nE.   Revised Cost Estimates \n \n19.   The  revised  project  cost,  including  the  amount  originally  financed,  is  estimated  at \n$78.9 million.  Loan  financing  of  $38.8 million  equivalent  comprises  $16.2 million  in  foreign \nexchange and $22.7 million equivalent in local currency costs. Table 1 contains a summary cost \nestimate. Appendix 12 contains revised project cost details and the financing plan for NECORD II.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2004.

Revised Financing Plan \n \n20.  The supplementary loan for $12.77 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund resources (ADF) to finance NECORD II. The revised cost estimates and financing plan, \nincluding this supplementary loan are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The total project of $78.9 \nmillion is being financed with (i) a loan not exceeding $38.8 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources; (ii) a grant of $14.0 million from the eighth replenishment of the ADF; (iii) a grant \nfrom Sida for SKr40 million ($5.9 million equivalent), which is being used to finance 100% of the \ncost  (excluding  duties  and  taxes)  of  rehabilitating  provincial  and  rural  roads  in  Northern  and \nEastern provinces; and (iv) a grant of A$8 million ($7.3 million equivalent) from the Government of \nAustralia. The government's contribution for taxes and duties is $12.9 million. Details on the \noriginal and revised project financing plan are in Appendix 2 and 12 respectively. ADB will finance \nthe cost of the activities to be undertaken under the scope of NECORD II except for duties, taxes, \nand incremental expenditures.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The  executing  agency  for  the  project  is  the  Ministry  of  Nation  Building  and  Estate \nInfrastructure and the implementing agencies are the Northern and Eastern provincial councils. \nThe government and ADB are proposing this supplementary finance because NECORD II has \nestablished effective implementation mechanisms in all districts in Northern province, enabling \nspeedy implementation and results. Therefore, the implementation arrangements and structure will \nnot be changed, except that additional engineers will be included to ensure quality and further \nexpedite the implementation of the subprojects (Appendix 13).The approval of subprojects will \nfollow the transparent process adopted under the ongoing loans and grants implemented in the \nconflict-affected areas, and subprojects will be approved by the provincial project coordinating \ncommittee as in the original loan. Ground-level coordination through the government agent and by \nthe ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission with other multilateral and bilateral development partners will \nensure activities and approaches are complementary.  \n  \n22.  The PMU will use the same management information system that was developed for the \nNorth East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD) to track progress and \nperformance of subprojects and generate progress reports.13 The information is also uploaded to \nthe project website.14  \n \n23.  Procurement. International competitive bidding will be used to procure equipment and \nmaterials with an estimated cost of more than $500,000 equivalent. National competitive bidding \nwill be used when the estimated cost is $500,000 equivalent or less. Goods and works valued at \n$100,000 equivalent or less will be procured under shopping procedures. Goods costing less than \n$10,000 equivalent may be directly purchased from a supplier. The average value of the 565 \nsubprojects implemented under NECORD II is less than $1 million, and mainly national contractors \n(including  contractors  from  the  provinces)  were  used.  This  has  helped  develop  the  local \nconstruction industry, especially the contractors in Northern and Eastern provinces. The use of \nprivate sector contractors is expected to continue with the new subprojects. If because of urgency \nthe government requests the use of state-owned enterprises to repair some of the damaged \ncommunity infrastructure (as done under government's 180-day program explained in para. 8), \nstaff will review the requests on a case-by-case basis. Where justified in accordance with ADB's \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President: Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project. Manila (Loan 1846-SRI). \n14  North East Community Restoration and Development Project. http://www.necord.org/  \n ", "8 \nrequirements and policies, the use of state-owned enterprises will be allowed for limited force \naccount work. The revised procurement plan is in Appendix 14.  \n \n24.  Implementation schedule. The current loan closing date of 30 March 2010 is proposed to \nbe extended to 31 December 2011, resulting in a cumulative loan period of 6.5 years. ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy states a maximum time frame of 5 years in a post-\nconflict situation. If not for the proposed supplementary financing, NECORD II would have been \nclosed within the allowed time frame for post-conflict rehabilitation. However, a waiver is requested \nto allow an additional 1.5 years to complete the proposed activities under this supplementary \nfinancing in view of the new emergency situation that has arisen and the resettlement process now \nunder way. Since NECORD II has established effective implementation mechanisms in all districts \nin Northern province, speedy implementation is possible in responding to a new post-conflict \nemergency situation.  \n \n25.  Retroactive  financing. To continue the ongoing urgent small rehabilitation works, the \ngovernment has asked for retroactive financing for immediate imports and rehabilitation of key \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  facilities.  ADB  has  agreed  to  provide  retroactive  financing  for \nexpenditures incurred during the 4 months before the signing of the loan, subject to a maximum of \n20% of the loan amount, provided that the expenditures are procured in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The government has been advised \nthat provision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any part of the proposed \nsupplementary financing to NECORD II. \n \n26.  Potential  cofinancing.  Many  bilateral  development  partners  are  considering  providing \nadditional support in Northern provincial districts to address the still urgent need to help returning \nIDPs meet their basic needs and reestablish their livelihoods in the post-conflict situation. To \nensure quick, efficient, and complementary assistance to the beneficiaries, some development \npartners are considering linking with ongoing successful projects in the area. Cofinancing allows \nfull and efficient use of the existing PMU and institutional resources, and effective accountability. \nGrant cofinancing also provides an effective complement to loan funds. ADB has had discussions \nwith several development partners and additional grant cofinancing is possible.  \n \n27.  Under the original report and recommendation of the President for NECORD II, the Board \nauthorized ADB to administer loans or grants to be provided by any development partner or \ncofinancier, after the date of the project\u2019s Board approval. For the reasons set out in para. 26 it is \nproposed  that  the  Board  also  authorize  ADB  to  administer  loans  or  grants  provided  by  any \ndevelopment partner or cofinancier after the date of Board approval of this supplementary loan, on \nthe same basis. These bases are that approval of such additional cofinancing would be confirmed \nand approved by Management, and reported to the Board in accordance with the usual quarterly \nreporting. This procedure would only be adopted to the extent that the additional funds provided by \ncofinanciers would not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and scope \nof the existing project.  Any proposed cofinancing that did materially alter or fundamentally affect \nthe objectives, purposes, and scope of the project would be processed as a major change in scope \nand circulated to the Board.   \n \n28.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and executing agency. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed ", "    9\nby ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \nIV.   PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n29.  In the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, poverty levels are estimated to be \nabout 37%\u2014much higher than in the rest of the country, although there are gaps in government \nsurveys  for  much  of  the  area.  Basic  socioeconomic  facilities  need  to  be  restored  if  affected \ncommunities are to recover and return to normalcy. An updated summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 15.  \n \n30.  NECORD II will address the urgent needs of about 1.5 million people, including a significant \nnumber  of  physically  disabled  people,  households  headed  by  women,  and  children.  Of  this \npopulation,  about  290,000  people  who  were  in  welfare  centers  for  much  of  2009  are  being \nresettled  in  their  original  places  of  residence.  By  restoring  essential  community  and  social \ninfrastructure and services, as well as agriculture and fisheries sectors that form the backbone of \nthe economy in the affected areas, NECORD II will help to rebuild affected communities and to \nstabilize the economic base of local populations, helping people to move from dependence on \ngovernment support to sustainable livelihoods.  \n \n31.   NECORD II focuses on restoring preexisting facilities, allowing for technical improvements \nand future demand, based on a least-cost approach. Taking into consideration the many years of \nneglect, project interventions focus not only on the physical rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure \nbut also on the restoration of the physical and institutional arrangements for legal, administrative, \nand technical services.  \n \n32.  Creating  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  the  participation  of  vulnerable  and \nmarginalized groups in the conflict-affected areas in reconstruction activities is an urgent need. \nWar widows, households headed by women, single parent families and single women with elderly \ndependents have to deal with transformations in social roles that place new burdens on them. The \nproject  will  help  them  to  reestablish  local  community  organizations  and  provide  them  with \nlivelihood-related  skills  training,  access  to  credit  and  extension  services  and  necessary \nadministrative and legal services. This will enable them to become economically independent, \nimprove the well-being of their families and in the longer term will reduce existing inequalities, \ndiscrimination and marginalization. An updated gender action plan is in Appendix 16. \n \nB.  Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigation Measures \n \n33.  The  project  incorporates  a  number  of  safeguards  to  improve  and  strengthen  the \ngovernance and institutional capacity of the executing agency, implementing agencies, and the \nPMU. The assessment of ongoing projects indicates that the risks have been well managed. \nCoordination and monitoring by the ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission further strengthened the \nprocess.  \n \n34.  Risks. Price escalation is one of the main risks. An increase in the demand for construction \nmaterials, which are already in short supply, could drive up prices and affect the amount of \nreconstruction that can be carried out in the area. Based on the lessons after the 2004 tsunami, \nADB has highlighted the issue with the government. To minimize the risk, studies are under way to \n ", "10 \nidentify adequate sites for supply of construction materials, and to obtain all necessary statutory \npermits  to  facilitate  the  construction  industry.  Contracts  will  be  closely  monitored  for  price \nvariations.   \n \n35.  Demining. Complete demining of the area will still take some time. In addition to the \nsecurity forces, eight agencies are assisting the government in demining. The Ministry of Nation \nBuilding is coordinating the activities of these agencies at the national level, while government \nagents  or  district secretaries  are  facilitating  at  the  ground  level.  Some  development  partners \n(mainly the United Nations and bilateral agencies) are also supporting this effort. Clearing village \nareas and farmland to enable the prompt return of IDPs is the priority. \n \nV.   ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has given the following assurances, relevant to NECORD II, in addition to \nthe standard assurances. These will be incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Continuity  and  integration.  The  government  will  ensure  the  continuity  of  the \nimplementation of the work financed under the original NECORD II and the work \nfinanced under the supplementary finance. \n \n(ii)  Government administration. The project management arrangements reflect the \npresent  government  administrative  structure  that  may  change  during \nimplementation.  The  government  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  any  proposed \nchange  in  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  areas,  and  take  all  steps \nnecessary to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability of the project. The government will take all steps necessary and within its \npower to ensure that any successor project management entities enter into such \nproject agreements, or other agreements with ADB, as ADB may request.  \n \n(iii)  Peace building and community reconciliation. The government will ensure that \nall conflict-related project interventions contribute to peace building and community \nreconciliation. If any proposed subproject or intervention has an actual or threatened \nnegative impact on peace building and community reconciliation, the government \nagrees that ADB shall be entitled to determine whether such intervention should be \ncontinued, redesigned, suspended, or canceled.  \n \n(iv)  Access. The government will ensure that staff, consultants, materials, vehicles, \nequipment,  and  other  items  required  for  project  implementation  will  be  given \nreasonable access to project areas.  \n \n(v)  Operation  and  maintenance.  The  government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies to ensure, that the project facilities \nare operated and maintained, and that adequate budgetary and other resources are \nprovided for this purpose. The government will also ensure that community-based \norganizations charged with operating and maintaining facilities provided under both \nprojects are provided with the necessary support and training to undertake such \nactivities.  \n \n(vi)  Subproject selection. The government and each implementing agency will ensure \nthat all subprojects meet to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, the agreed selection criteria and ", "    11\nother  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  subprojects  are  controlled  and \nmonitored to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \n \n(vii)  Governance  and  anticorruption. The government and ADB agree to adopt a \npolicy of zero-tolerance of corruption in relation to assistance provided under the \nproject(s), and by development partners. The government will take measures to \nquickly  sanction  private  individuals,  entities,  or  public  officials  who  actually  or \nattempt to take advantage of donor funds, or the loss of documents, such as the \nabsence of property title documents, court records, or bank accounts.  \n \n(viii)  Statement of expenditures audit. The government agrees to ensure that ADB staff \nmembers are granted access to key books and records in order to complete a \nstatement of expenditures audit within 6 months of effectiveness.  \n \n(ix)  Post-completion audit. The government will ensure that a special post-completion \nperformance audit is conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency \npolicy to consider governance, transparency, and financial accountability.  \n \n(x)  ADB monitoring and compliance. The government will allow and facilitate ADB\u2019s \nrepresentatives to conduct spot and random checks on (a) flow of funds through the \nimprest  account,  each  second-generation  imprest  account,  and  each  third-\ngeneration imprest account, and their use for the project in accordance with the \nfinancing agreement; (b) work in progress; and (c) project implementation. \n \n(xi)  Participation. The government will ensure, or will cause each executing agency or \nimplementing  agency  to  ensure,  that  community-based  organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  beneficiaries  are  involved  in  subproject \nselection, design, implementation, and monitoring.  \n \n37.  The execution of a project agreement in a form satisfactory to ADB is a condition to loan \neffectiveness.  ADB will require a project agreement in a form substantially the same as that \nagreed under the original NECORD II project.  \n \nVI.   RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n(i)   the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR8.15 million to the Democratic \nSocialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project II from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest rate of \n1.0% per year; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; repayment \nof principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board;  \n \n(ii)  a waiver of para. 88 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), which \nsets the maximum term of an emergency loan in a post-conflict situation at 5 years; \nand \n \n ", "12 \n(iii)   the

This section outlines the scope of the sectors. The broad selection criteria are explained \nin  the  main  text  of  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  the  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development Project II1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  Areas where the conflict was heavy since 2006 will be prioritized. These areas include \nparts  of  Jaffna,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya,  and  all  of  Kilinochchi  and  Mullaitivu  districts.  The \nsubprojects will cover the reconstruction of partly and fully damaged basic social infrastructure, \nexpansion  of  rural  electrification,  and  restarting  livelihoods.  Emphasis  will  be  given  to \nreestablishing the civil administration, basic health care, schools, rural electrification schemes, \nminor access roads, minor irrigation, community water supply, and vocational and skills training \nfor livelihood development. An indicative cost estimate for the sectors is in Table A7.1.  \n \n3.  Health.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture, construction of doctors quarters at hospital compounds, and rehabilitation of village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection  criterion  will  stipulate  the  availability  of  sufficient  qualified  staff  to  operate  the \nrehabilitated facilities, as well as other existing facilities. Some of the key facilities identified \ninclude  the  Kilinochchi,  Mullaitivu,  and  Trincomalee  hospitals.  Funds  earmarked  for  the \nTrincomalee hospital are being used for urgent works under the 180-day program in selected \nvillages in Northern province. 2 \n \n4.  Education. Subprojects will restore services and facilities through (i) reconstruction and \nrehabilitation  of  teaching  facilities  and  school  buildings  serving  a  large  population  area; \n(ii) construction  of  cluster  housing  units  for  teachers  in  areas  where  housing  is  limited  or \nunavailable; and (iii) provision of training to teachers in special subjects, such as primary, \nenglish, science, and math. Schools will only be rehabilitated where teachers are or can be \nmade available. Cluster housing units will be provided where housing is limited or has been \ndestroyed. Specialist training will be provided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially \nnew recruits.  \n \n5.  Community  development. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several \nsectors will help restore livelihoods. These subprojects include livelihood development, skills \ndevelopment, small community-based and medium-sized town water supply schemes along \nwith sanitation facilities, and support for reconciliation and social cohesion. These activities will \nbe undertaken, particularly where internally displaced persons (IDPs) are returning. Livelihood \nopportunities  will  be  provided  in  communities  through  subprojects  that  promote  livestock \ndevelopment and home gardening, microfinance and creating a revolving fund, provide facilities \nfor seed production, and support fisheries development. Also includes the unified assistance \nscheme, which is provided to every returning IDP. Under this scheme, a family is entitled to \nSLRs25,0003 as a livelihood or resettlement grant and SLRs325,000  as a housing grant after \nthey  settle  in  their  original  place  of  residence.  Beneficiaries  are  selected  using  a  strict \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II. \nManila (Loan 2168-SRI[SF], Grants 0007-SRI and 0013-SRI) \n2  The government introduced a 180-day program to rehabilitate the essential basic infrastructure and facilitate \nresettlement of IDPs in Eastern province. Most IDPs in the province\u2014about 150,000\u2014were resettled during 2008 \nand almost all by mid-2009. \n3  The Government may revise this scheme to reflect the current requirement.  \n ", "3 0  Appendix 7 \nmethodology, and the payment is made only through a bank account opened on behalf of the \nbeneficiary.  The  grant  is  to  buy  basic  kitchen  utensils,  agricultural  implements,  seeds, \nschoolbooks or uniforms, livestock, roofing and building materials, or any other activity that will \nmake IDPs confident and restart their lives. Skills development and service training will be \nprovided  for  microenterprise  development  in  areas  such  as  horticulture,  post-harvest  food \nprocessing, and tourism and hotels. To enable community-based organizations to promote \nmicroenterprise development at the village level, skills training will be carried out, and revolving \nfunds will be established and managed by the community-based organization. Gender-oriented \nprograms for enterprise development, initiated as a pilot program under the previous projects \nrelated to northeast community restoration and development, will be expanded to a wider range \nof fishing and agricultural communities.  \n \n6.  Irrigation. Activities will include rehabilitation of small, medium-sized, and large irrigation \nschemes. Works will include rehabilitation of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and \nother structures\u2014without changes to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The activity will be \nlinked to village, agriculture, and livestock development.  \n \n7.  Access  roads.  Rural  access  road  construction  will  use  labor-intensive  methods  to \nprovide gravel-surfaced rural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, \nor community facilities. A small number of class C or D provincial roads will be rehabilitated with \nall-weather surfaces. All road construction will be on existing alignments and will not require \nland acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n8.  Institutional infrastructure. Service delivery will be improved through subprojects that \nrestore damaged local government facilities, district administrative offices, corporative societies, \ncourts,  and  registrars  offices.  Based  on  needs,  damaged  transportation  facilities  (such  as \ndouble cabs and motorcycles) will be provided. 4 \n \n9.  Rural electrification. Northern province has the lowest electrification ratio in Sri Lanka. \nThe electrification ratio is particularly low in Kilinochchi, Mannar, and Mullaitivu. Under ADB\u2019s \nConflict-Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project,5 cofinanced by the Government of Norway, 102 \nrural schemes and 21 medium-voltage schemes were identified for rural electrification in these \ndistricts. Before the closure of the Conflict-Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project, only 76 rural \nschemes and 1 medium voltage scheme could be completed. However, under that project, all \nmaterials  required  for  the  balance  schemes  will  be  procured  before  March  2010.  For  the \nremaining 26 rural and 20 medium-voltage schemes, it is proposed that the local input cost be \nfunded under this project. The list of the 46 schemes is in Table A7.2.  \n \n10.  Under  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project, 6 \nelectromechanical facilities such as hospital bed lifts, piped medical gas system, mortuary \ncoolers,  air  conditioning  system,  package  waste  treatment  plant,  generators,  and  hospital \nfurniture were provided to Kilinochchi General Hospital. Some of the electromechanical items \nand  furniture  were  provided  with  grant  cofinancing  from  the  governments  of  Norway  and \nFinland. However, because of the resurgence of conflict and resulting security restrictions, these \nitems were installed at other hospitals in Northern and Eastern provinces. The subprojects will \n                                                 \n4   It is estimated that at least 15 double cabs and 50 motorcycles will be purchased. \n5  ADB. 2004.

Introduction \n \n1.  The project-specific grievance prevention and resolution analysis intends to contribute to \nenhancing the capability of the North East Community Restoration and Development Project \n(NECORD) II to address potential project-related conflict and grievances arising during design \nand implementation. This appendix (i) examines the sources and consequences of conflict, (ii) \ndetermines  the  factors  that  can  be  addressed  or  prevented  through  NECORD  II,  and  (iii) \ndetermines how to strengthen resilience through development assistance.  \n \nB.   Setting \n \n2.  Northern province has an area of 8,884 square kilometers, covering 14% of the total \nlandmass of Sri Lanka. This includes 6.6% (594 square kilometers) of inland waters and about \n54% of forest coverage (4,797 square kilometers). Based on the 1981 census, the province had \nan estimated population of more than 1.1 million, of which nearly 86% are Sri Lankan Tamils, \n3% Sinhalese, 6% Tamils of Indian origin, and 5% Muslims. Before the conflict, the province \naccounted for a significant share of the gross domestic product (GDP) through agricultural \nproducts such as paddy, vegetables, livestock, and fruits. It also had small-scale industries such \nas light manufacturing and textiles. Further, the province had significant potential to increase the \nexport-oriented industries based on its rich natural resources. However, Northern province \ncontributed only 2.9% of GDP in 2007\u2014the lowest regional share. \n \nB.  Conflict Prevention and Resolution Analysis \n \n3.  NECORD II responds to the needs of the IDPs from all ethnic groups in the Northern \nprovince. During the preparation of the supplementary financing, discussions were held with \nprovincial and district officials (where possible), as well as central government officials, to \nensure  ownership  of  the  project  and  its  outputs.  Given  that  the  resettlement  process  is \nunderway and many IDPs have recently started to return to their original home areas, it was not \npossible to undertake consultations with the returning IDPs themselves. However, consultations \nwill be done during subproject design and implementation once communities have begun to be \nreestablished.  The supplementary financing is designed to ensure that the outcomes are \nshared equitably among ethnic groups and across the entire target areas. NECORD II is not \nexpected to contribute to any intensification of social tensions. Based on lessons derived from \nimplementing ADB-funded projects in conflict-affected areas, the implementing agencies should \ncontinue to explain the objectives to local political and other community leaders to gain their \nendorsement and acceptance.  \n \n4.  As noticed in the ongoing projects in the conflict-affected areas, a large percentage of \nthe  contracts  based  on  competitive  bidding  are  being  undertaken  by  contractors  from  the \ndistricts. The same trend is expected with the proposed supplementary loan. Similarly, local \nlabor is seen to benefit from the subprojects in these areas. Local labor will not only earn \nlivelihoods from jobs created by the subprojects, but also gain skills that will make the workers \nmore employable in the long term all around the country.  \n \n5.  In  the  current  post  conflict-situation,  some  security  restrictions  will  continue.  The \nimplementing agencies, as in the ongoing projects in these areas, will coordinate and facilitate \nimplementation of subprojects without undue delay. All contractors are expected to adhere to \nthe security procedures in place. During the initial phases of implementation, subprojects are \n ", "4 2  Appendix 9 \nexpected to be slow in areas where significant security restrictions remain (especially in some \ndivisions of the Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts) because mines need to be cleared and the \nsearch for arms and ammunition that may still be stored in these areas must be completed. \nHowever, these restrictions will be removed and free access will be given once a secure and \nsafe  environment  for  the  returning  internally  displaced  persons  is  ensured.  Further,  the \ngovernment has indicated that an elected provincial council, as in Eastern province, will be \nestablished as soon as the situation permits. Project reviews would also include assessments of \nchanges in the political and security environment, as well as project impacts on community \nharmony in the target areas. \n \n6.  Table  A9  identifies  potential  problems  that  could  arise  during  the  design  and \nimplementation of the supplementary finance project. These problems are common to all the \ndistricts under NECORD II. Where relevant and appropriate, specific requirements have also \nbeen mentioned. Table A9 provides key indicators for each set of potential problems and \nproposed solutions to them. \n \n7.  Project components, as presented, will contribute to rebuilding confidence in conflict-\naffected areas and improving access to basic social services. Implementing the supplementary \nfinance project in a manner that reduces social tensions between districts or areas will be a \nchallenge. This can be done by ensuring that (i) target areas and communities are selected in \nways that reflect the ethnic composition of the area; and (ii) transparency is pursued in all \nphases of the project, allowing the relevant authorities, community leaders, and beneficiaries to \nunderstand the project parameters and how it is progressing. \n \nTable A9: Grievance Prevention and Resolution Analysis \n \nSpecific Issues \nPotential Problem  Indicators  Identified  Means of Solving \nDesign Stage \nDistrict imbalance  Most of the  Needs of some  The project incorporates detailed \nsubprojects from one  districts may be  selection criteria, and balance is \ndistrict   greater than other  maintained through the \ndistricts   subproject selection and \napproval process.  \nPoverty and  Exclusion of a  Average poverty level  The design includes the needs of \neconomic  particular location,  in project area is high  all ethnic groups in the project \ninequality in  area, or ethnic group  compared to the rest  area. \nproject areas    of the country \nProject components focus on \nExclusion of host \nneeds of all IDPs. \nfamilies and internally \ndisplaced persons  All project districts are treated \n(IDPs) as project  homogeneously to ensure that \nbeneficiaries  infrastructure development \nprograms are consistent with \nbasic needs and consistent with \nthe \"do no harm\" principle. \nImplementation Stage \nRestrictions in  Security restrictions  Possible security  The government agents or \nmovement  restrictions to certain  district secretaries facilitate to  \nareas because of land  priority demining to the proposed \nmines  subproject areas.  \n \n ", "        Appendix 9   43 \n \nSpecific Issues \nPotential Problem  Indicators  Identified  Means of Solving \nEmployment and  Employment  High unemployment  Contract packages are small and \naccess to  opportunities for the  rate  district-level local employment is \nproductive  local population  foreseen. \nSeasonal availability \nresources   \nof labor  Skills training will be provided by \nExcess movement of \na number of development partner \nlabor forces from  Low number of \nprograms.  \noutside the districts  qualified and skilled \nemployees available  Temporary migration of skilled \nin the area   personnel during the initial period \nis foreseen.  \nLack of capacity in  Delay in  Additional workload  There will be close and \nprovincial and  implementation  because of the  continuous monitoring and \ndistrict institutions  number of  discussion with the government \ndevelopment partners  to ensure necessary additional \nin the area.  staff are allocated to the \nimplementing agencies.  \nLack of local  Unfair   competition.

Introduction \n1.  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  for  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project (NECORD) II will support the government\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate essential \ninfrastructure and services damaged or destroyed as a result of the conflict in Northern and \nEastern provinces. Subprojects to be supported under the supplementary finance components \ninclude (i) reconstruction of partly and fully damaged basic infrastructure (schools, basic health \ncare services, minor irrigation schemes); (ii) expansion of rural electrification; (iii) rehabilitation \nof minor access roads; and (iv) reconstruction and rehabilitation of vocational and skills training \ncenters to assist livelihood restoration and development. \n2.  Exact locations of subprojects have not yet been identified. The final location of some of \nthe  subprojects  may  include  areas  that  are  being  demined.  Therefore,  environmental \nassessments cannot be prepared before approval of this supplementary finance. Given the \ntypes of subprojects that have been identified, it is unlikely that any of the components will \ngenerate significant, adverse environmental impacts. The anticipated impacts will largely be \nreversible  and  manageable  through  the  adoption  of  suitable  mitigation  measures.  The \nsupplementary loan will support subprojects that are similar in scope to those subprojects \nsupported earlier under NECORD II. Therefore, the supplementary finance project is classified \nas category B for environmental impacts. The assessment and review procedures proposed in \nthe framework are based on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement.1 \nB.  Assessment of Legal Framework and Institutional Capacity \n3.  Environmental assessment requirements stipulated by the Government of Sri Lanka for \nprojects outside the coastal zone are found in the National Environmental Act 47 of 1980, \namended by Act 56 of 1988 and Act 53 of 2000.2 Environmental assessments of projects within \nthe coastal zone are governed by the Coast Conservation Act 57 of 1981, amended by Act 64 of \n1988.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  National  Environmental  Act,  environmental \nassessments  are  required  for  prescribed  projects.3 Under  the  National  Environmental  Act, \nprescribed projects are stipulated in three parts listed in the schedule of the respective Gazette. \nPart I identifies prescribed projects based on type and magnitude; Part II identifies prescribed \nprojects as, all subprojects identified in Part I, irrespective of their magnitude and  selected high-\npolluting industries, if near culturally and/or environmentally sensitive areas defined in Part III of \nthe schedule (presented in Table A10). Since the subprojects focus on rehabilitating community \ninfrastructure  and  services,  none  fall  within  type  (i)  prescribed  projects.  Nevertheless,  all \nsubprojects will be screened for type (ii) prescribed projects, using the checklist provided (Table \nA10). All subproject interventions within the coastal zone require the approval of the Coast \nConservation Department. The department director may request the developer to submit an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) before any development work starts. In addition, under \nthe Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance 2 of 1937, amended by Act 49 of 1993 and Act 22 of \n2009, any new development activity within 1 mile (1.61 kilometers) of the boundary of a national \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n2  Defined in the Coast Conservation Act as \u201cthe area lying within a 300m landwards of the mean high water line and \na limit of 2 km seawards of the mean low water line and in the case of rivers, streams, lagoons, or any other body \nof water connected to the sea either permanently or periodically, the landward boundary shall extend to a limit of 2 \nkm measure perpendicular to the straight base line drawn between the natural entrance points thereof and shall \ninclude waters of such rivers, streams and lagoons or any other body of water so connected to the sea.\u201d \n3  Listed in Gazette Extraordinary of 772/22 of 24 June 1993. \n ", "        Appendix 10  45 \n \nreserve  requires  prior  written  approval  of  the  director  of  the  Department  of  Wildlife \nConservation. \n4.  During  project  implementation,  as  per  the  national  environmental  requirements, \nenvironmental  protection  licenses  and  other  permits  from  relevant  agencies,  such  as  the \nGeological Survey and Mines Bureau, would be needed to operate quarry sites, borrow sites, \nasphalt plants, and crusher plants. \n5.  The  EIA  process  in  Sri  Lanka,  which  has  been  in  operation  since  1981,  is \ncomprehensive and well developed.4 One of the notable features is the mandatory 30-day \npublic  review  and  comment  period  and,  if  thought  necessary,  the  requirement  of  a  public \nhearing. However, while the EIA process functions well, it is limited to prescribed projects, which \nare based on predetermined criteria (that specify limits and types of activities). As a result, \ndevelopment activities not listed among the prescribed projects, but which have the potential to \ncause  significant  environmental  impacts,  escape  the  formal  requirements  of  environmental \nassessment. This is a key difference between the government's environmental assessment and \nADB's  environmental  assessment  requirements.  Furthermore,  because  of  inadequate \nmanpower  and  financial  resources,  monitoring  and  inspection  by  the  approval  authority  is \ngenerally  complaint-driven,  or  carried  out  during  processing  or  renewals  of  environmental \nprotection licenses. Recognizing these limitations, this framework describes measures to be \nadopted to improve environmental monitoring and compliance. \nC.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts \n6.  Negative project impacts are expected mainly during the construction stage. As most of \nphysical works will constitute rehabilitation of damaged or destroyed infrastructure, new impacts \nassociated with the location of the respective subprojects are not expected. Typical impacts \nexpected  in  reconstruction  activities  are  generation  of  dust,  erosion,  disruption  of  traffic, \ndisposal of waste, and temporary disruption to access of those living next to the works areas. \nDust will be generated during the haulage of construction material from exposed working areas, \nand at crusher plants and borrow pits. This can be mitigated through the adoption of suitable \nmitigation  measures,  such  as  covering  material  during  transport  and  stockpiling,  proper \ncompaction of base (in road construction projects) and regular watering during construction, and \nadoption of sufficient numbers of sprinklers at plant sites. In addition, soil erosion from exposed \nsurfaces will create adverse impacts, such as blocking of drainage paths and silting of paddy \nlands. These will have to be managed through the adoption of temporary and permanent \nerosion-control measures and the provision of suitable drainage.  \n7.  One main issue with respect to all construction activities is the limited availability of \nsufficient quantities of construction material (earth and gravel) in Northern province. Suitable \nborrow and quarry sites are often not found in Northern province, which means such materials \nmust be brought in from faraway places. The implementing agency and project management \nunit (PMU) will ensure that sites selected as borrow and quarry sites will have sufficient material \nto cater to the needs of Northern province, including the area it is located in, and that haulage \nwill be done along roads approved by the respective local authorities to ensure that the roads \nhave sufficient carrying capacity for such cargo. Borrow pits and quarry sites will have the \nrequired government permits, and will be managed during and after use, following government \nprescribed guidelines or good practices. \n8.  Off-site impacts include impacts of disposal sites (for spoil waste) and of borrow and \nquarry sites. Borrow and quarry sites should be rehabilitated after the extraction to ensure that \n                                                 \n4  First introduced through the Coast Conservation Act in 1981 for only the coastal zone, and then through the \nNational Environmental Act in 1988 for the entire country. \n ", " 46  Appendix 10 \nwater does not stagnate and erosion does not increase, nor pose risks of drowning. Spoil waste \nwill be disposed of only at sites approved by local authorities and that meet standards and \nrequirements stipulated in the respective environmental protection licenses provided by the \nCentral Environmental Authority (CEA) or relevant local authority.  \n9.  The reconstruction and renovation of irrigation schemes include canal desilting, and \nrepairing earthen bunds, channels, anicuts, and sluice gates. Typical impacts associated with \nthe reconstruction of such irrigation schemes are similar to those described in para. 6 - 8, and \ncan be mitigated with appropriate measures. Other impacts associated with irrigation schemes \nare the possibilities of water logging, and increase in salinity. One key concern will be finding \nsuitable sites for disposal of dredged material. All dredged material will be disposed of at sites \napproved by local authorities. The sites should have arrangements to contain the disposal areas \nto avoid spillovers to adjoining land by having suitable protection bunds and drainage measures \nin place. Once the water has drained through the material, it is suitable to fertilize fields as such \nmaterials are often rich in organic matter. Therefore, wherever possible, reuse of disposed \nmaterials in agriculture will be considered. Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes will exclude tanks \nthat require raising of bunds, as this would increase the inundation area. \n10.  The impacts associated with the rehabilitation of buildings are minimal and typical of \nthose experienced during any construction activity. They can be managed. Impacts associated \nwith operations such as solid waste disposal, waste water management, and drainage are dealt \nwith during the design of such buildings. In particular, rehabilitation of medical centers should \nensure that proper systems are in place to separate clinical waste from other waste, and that \nappropriate design and operational measures are in place to deal with the disposal of such \nwaste.  Appropriate measures are required to address these impacts and should be included in \nthe designs submitted to local authorities, as per the requirements of the building code to obtain \nthe building permits.  \nD.  Environmental Assessment for Components \n11.  To ensure that the supplementary finance project meets ADB's environmental safeguard \nrequirements stipulated in the Safeguard Policy Statement, subprojects will be screened to \ndetermine the level of environmental assessment required. Based on preliminary information \navailable on the type of project activities, the rehabilitation of roads, water supply, and irrigation, \nas well as hospital construction are expected to have limited environmental impacts. As such, \nthey  would  need  initial  environment  examinations  (IEEs)  together  with  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs). The rehabilitation of buildings will also be screened to determine \ntheir environmental impact category, and if required, environmental assessments will be carried \nout.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  screening  the  subprojects,  conducting  the  necessary \nenvironmental assessments, and submitting them to ADB for concurrence.  \n12.  Consultants funded under the project will support the implementing agency in preparing \nthe necessary environmental assessments, if required. All IEEs including EMPs will be prepared \nreviewed and cleared by ADB, and approved by the government, as required, prior to issuance \nof  bid  documents  and  award  of  construction  contracts.  Bid  documents  will  include  the \nrequirement to incorporate adequate resources for implementing the EMP, which will form part \nof the contract document and, if required, will need to be updated during project implementation. \n \n \n \n \n ", "        Appendix 10  47 \n \nE.   Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Redress Mechanism \n13.  During  planning  and  implementation,  beneficiary  and  affected  communities  will  be \nconsulted to ensure that their concerns and needs are addressed. The consultation process will \nbe well documented in the environmental assessment reports. During the consultations, the IA \nwill provide relevant environmental information, including information from the IEE documents \nand in a form understandable to affected people and other stakeholders.  This information will \nbe  shared  with  all  beneficiaries  and  project-affected  persons.  Project  information  will  be \ndisseminated in local languages, and environmental assessment reports will be made available \nto all project-affected persons in a publicly accessible place. While there is no mandatory \ndisclosure of IEE reports for category B subprojects, the IEE will be made available to any \nmember of the public, if requested. \n14.  During  the  preparation  of  the  environmental  assessment  reports,  the  PMU  and \nimplementing agency will discuss and agree on a suitable grievance redress mechanism in \nconsultation with other stakeholders. The grievance redress mechanism shall be in place during \nconstruction and operation, until project closure. The grievance mechanism shall tame into \naccount specific cultural attributes as well as traditional mechanisms for raising and resolving \nissues.  The grievance redress system will allow parties affected by project activities to raise \ntheir concerns to contractors, government officials, and officers of the implementing agency \nincluding environmental and social safeguard specialists. The grievance redress committees \n(GRCs) are formed in districts to address land and compensation disputes and grievances. \nThey will also be the forum for addressing environmental grievances. The borrower/client should \nalso be aware of judicial and administrative mechanisms available in the country for resolution \nof disputes, and should not impede access to these mechanisms. The adoption of a grievance \nredress mechanism will facilitate timely implementation of the project. The GRC will meet as \nnecessary and when grievances are referred to it for redress at locations and times convenient \nto displaced persons. Records of all GRC meetings and proceedings will be kept at the PMU. \n15.  A grievance action form will be used to record all grievances and actions taken. The \ninformation to be recorded in this form will (at a minimum) contain (i) basic information about the \naffected  person  (name,  address,  contact  number);  (ii)  date  of  last  disclosure  meeting;  (iii) \ncategory of grievance filed (e.g., legal, social, environmental, technical and/or engineering, \nfinancial); (iv) detailed description of grievance; and (v) type of action taken (resolved at the \nGRC) or referred to higher authorities. The grievance action form will be filled out by the GRC \nmember  receiving  a  grievance  and  signed  by  the  affected  party  and  the  receiver  of  the \ncomplaint.

The following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \nof potential environmental problems and risks related to each subproject. \n \n17.  The implementing agencies will have the following responsibilities: \n \n(i)  Determine  the  environmental  category  of  each  subproject  where  the \nenvironmental category has already not been determined.  \n(ii)  Inform  and  consult  project  affected  persons  and  beneficiaries  during \npreparation of the IEE report  \n(iii)  Prepare  an  IEE  report  with  EMP  for  each  subproject  categorized  as \ncategory B, and submit the documents to ADB for review and clearance. \n ", " 48  Appendix 10 \n(iv)  Obtain environmental clearance from the project approving agency (if \nrequired) and ADB for environmental compliance before awarding any \ncivil works contracts for the subproject.  \n(v)  Include environmental safeguards to be adopted during construction in \nthe contract documents of all subprojects. For a subproject that requires \nan  IEE,  its  contract  documents  will  also  include  clauses  for  the \nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures, as described in the \nIEE  report  and  EMP,  and  the  implementing  agency  will  obtain  the \napproval of the project approving agency, if required.  \n \n18.  ADB will have the following responsibilities: \n  \n(i)  Ensure that the executing agency informs and consults all stakeholders \nas prescribed in the SPS. \n(ii)  Review IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \n(iii)  Monitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring,  as \nnecessary. \n(iv)  Upload the monitoring reports upon receipt. \n \nD.  Monitoring and Reporting \n19.  The  implementing  agency  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake \nenvironmental monitoring of all subprojects. However, the implementing agency of a subproject \nis  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  and  the  approving  agency  on  the \nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures, as described in the IEE report and EMP. \nIf the implementing agency does not have the requisite staff to monitor the implementation of \nthe EMP, the implementing agency could engage consultants through the project. \n \n20.  Quarterly progress review reports submitted by the implementing agency to ADB shall \ninclude the progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental issues \nthat may have arisen during implementation, as well as the measures taken to address them. \nThe  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment \ndocuments, including the environmental monitoring reports, are maintained systematically as \npart  of  the  subproject  record.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB \nsemiannually. \n \nTable A10: Environmental Checklist \nDoes the subproject wholly or partly fall within any of these \nYes  No  Remarks \ncategories? \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed supplementary loan will support the Government of Sri Lanka in rebuilding \ncommunity  infrastructure  facilities  damaged  in  districts  in  Northern  province.  These  areas \ninclude parts of Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu districts. The subprojects \nwill cover the reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged social and physical infrastructure, \nsuch as rural minor access roads, minor irrigation, community water supply, hospitals, and \nschool buildings. The subprojects will also support the early recovery and restoration of income \nsources and livelihoods of conflict-affected persons. Most of physical works associated with \nthese subprojects will take place at their original locations, and therefore will not require land \nacquisition or minimize land acquisition and other resettlement impacts of the supplementary \nfinance project. 1 \n \n2.  Resettlement impacts of specific subprojects of the supplementary loan will only be \nknown during project implementation. As a result, the preparation of resettlement plans cannot \nbe done before approval of the supplementary loan. The resettlement framework sets out the \npolicy and procedures for screening project subprojects to identify resettlement impacts, if any, \nand to guide the executing agency and implementing agencies on how to prepare resettlement \nplans to address such impacts adequately and to implement them effectively. \n \n3.  If a subproject has involuntary resettlement impacts, a resettlement plan will be prepared \nto  address  such  impacts.  It  will  be  implemented  following  the  guidelines  given  in  the \nresettlement framework. The entitlement matrix of the resettlement framework will indicate the \napproved safeguard entitlement for each resettlement impact of the project. During project \nimplementation, if any other resettlement impact is identified, the executing agency of the \nproject, in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will revise the entitlement \nmatrix to address such impacts. \n \nB.  Subprojects with Resettlement Impacts  \n \n4.  Livelihood support. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several sectors \nwill  help  restore  livelihoods.  These  subprojects  include  skills  development,  water  supply \nschemes, and community mobilizations, particularly where the internally displaced people are \nreturning to their original locations. The main activities of livelihood restoration include training, \nhome garden improvements, fisheries development, seeds production, and fishing.  \n \n5.  School buildings. The damaged school buildings and teacher housing facilities will be \nrehabilitated, teachers will be provided training, and schools will be provided other facilities for \nthe students.   \n \n6.  Irrigation.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  the  selected  medium  and  minor  irrigation \nschemes  to  augment  irrigation  water  supplies  to  agriculture.  Tank  bunds,  access  roads, \nchannels, and other structures will be rehabilitated. \n \n                                                 \n1  Resettlement impacts arise from physical displacement (relocation, loss of residential land, or loss of shelter and \neconomic displacement (loss of land, assets, access to assets, income sources, or means of livelihood). They \ncould be permanent or temporary, and full or partial. \n ", "        Appendix 11  51 \n \n7.  Public  offices. The project will support the rehabilitation of office buildings.  District \nadministrative offices, courthouses, and associated facilities will be provided in some districts to \nenable the restoration of civil administration. \n \n8.  Health. Primary and secondary care health facilities will be rehabilitated, and hospitals \nwill  be  reconstructed  and  refurbished  with  provision  of  medical  equipment  and  furniture, \nincluding construction of doctors' quarters and dispensaries damaged during the conflict. \n \n9.  The rehabilitation of access roads, irrigation systems, and water supply schemes, and \nthe expansion of physical facilities are likely to have involuntary resettlement impacts. However, \nsuch impacts will be minor as most of the physical infrastructure will be rebuilt or rehabilitated at \ntheir original locations. \n \nC.  Scope, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n \n10.  The  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  the  Sri  Lanka  National  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  of  2001,  the  involuntary  resettlement  policy  component  of  the  ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement,2 the Land Acquisition Act of Sri Lanka, and various government \nregulations  pertaining  to  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance.  The  resettlement \nframework  distilled  the  relevant  policy  principles  from  these  sources,  and  they  reflect  the \nsafeguard policy requirements of the government and ADB. \n \n1.  The Scope of Resettlement Framework  \n11.  The resettlement framework covers involuntary physical displacement and economic \ndisplacement arising from land acquisition and restrictions on land use. Special attention is paid \nto the ownership rights of the affected persons. Any physical or economic displacement arising \nfrom the proposed project will require resettlement plans, formulated by following the guidelines \nof the resettlement framework.  \n \n2.  Policy Principles \n12.  Sri Lanka National Involuntary Resettlement Policy of 2001 lists several policy principles \nthat are applicable to all development projects: \n(i)  Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or reduced as much as possible by \nreviewing alternatives to the project as well as alternatives within the project. \n(ii)  Where  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  affected  people  should  be \nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life. \n(iii)  Gender equality and equity should be ensured and adhered to throughout the \npolicy application. \n(iv)  Displaced persons should be fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, \nlivelihood compensation, and development options as early as possible. \n(v)  Replacement land should be an option for compensation in the case of loss of \nland; in the absence of replacement land cash compensation should be an option \nfor all displaced persons. \n(vi)  Compensation for loss of land, structures, other assets and income should be \nbased on full replacement cost and should be paid promptly. This should include \ntransaction costs. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n ", " 52  Appendix 11 \n(vii)  Resettlement should be planned and implemented with full participation of the \nprovincial and local authorities. \n(viii)  To assist those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host \ncommunities, participatory measures should designed and implemented. \n(ix)  Common  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be \nprovided to project-affected people. \n(x)  Resettlement should be planned as a development activity for the benefit of the \nproject-affected people. \n(xi)  Displaced persons who do not have documented little to land should receive fair \nand just treatment. \n(xii)  Vulnerable  groups  should  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards. \n(xiii)  Project  executing  agencies  should  bear  the  full  costs  of  compensation  and \nresettlement. \n \n13.  The following ADB safeguard policy principles will also apply to the project: \n(i)  Develop procedures in a transparent, consistent, and equitable manner if land \nacquisition is through negotiated settlement to ensure that those people who \nenter into negotiated settlements will maintain the same or better income and \nlivelihood status. \n(ii)  Pay compensation and provide other resettlement entitlements before physical or \neconomic displacement. \n(iii)  Prepare a resettlement plan elaborating on displaced persons' entitlements, the \nincome and livelihood restoration strategy, institutional arrangements, monitoring \nand reporting framework, budget, and time-bound implementation schedule. \n \n3.  Land Acquisition Procedures \n14.  The land acquisition method is the application of the Land Acquisition Act. It is a long \nprocess  that  follows  prescribed  steps  and  procedures.  The  executing  agency  will  take \nnecessary actions to not to acquire land or any other asset under the Land Acquisition Act. \nHowever, if private lands are acquired, the affected persons are compensated according to the \nentitlement matrix, which reflects Sri Lankan laws and its involuntary resettlement policy, and \nthe ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n  \n4.  Entitlement Matrix \n15.  The  entitlement  matrix  is  not  exhaustive.  More  entitlements  may  be  added  if  any \nresettlement impact not listed in the matrix is identified during project implementation. However, \nthe entitlements may not be reduced or lowered. The entitlement matrix outlines the categories \nof resettlement impacts, displaced persons' entitlements, and implementation issues that need \nspecial attention of the executing agency and implementing agencies.  \n \n16.  In  accordance  with  the  involuntary  resettlement  framework,  displaced  persons  are \nentitled to a combination of compensation packages and resettlement assistance based on the \nnature  of  their  ownership  rights,  their  socioeconomic  vulnerability,  and  the  severity  of  the \nresettlement impacts. Their entitlements would include all or several of the following categories: \n(i)  compensation for permanent land losses at replacement cost, \n(ii)  compensation for temporary land losses at agreed rates,  \n(iii)  compensation for structures (residential and commercial) and other immovable \nassets at their replacement cost,  \n ", "        Appendix 11  53 \n \n(iv)  assistance to restore and improve income sources and livelihoods,  \n(v)  assistance for shifting belongings and salvaged items,  \n(vi)  market value of lost crops and trees at approved rates, \n(vii)  relocation facilities including housing and basic infrastructure, and \n(viii)  rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources and facilities.  \n \n \n ", " 54  Appendix 12 \nREVISED PROJECT FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A12.1: Revised Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan (ADF Grant) \n($ million) \n         Project  ADB  Cofinancing   Government and \nGrant Activity  Cost  ADF  Sida  AusAID  Beneficiaries  \n \nCommunity development  15.85  8.60    7.30      \n \nCivil works (access roads)  4.80  0.00  4.80       \n \nCivil works (institutional infrastructure)  2.00  2.00         \n \nEquipment (access roads)  0.50  0.00  0.50       \nGender programs and HIV  0.40  0.40         \nLivelihood grant  1.00  1.00         \nTraining (including skills)  2.00  2.00         \nConsulting services (access roads)  0.30  0.00  0.30       \nProject management and incremental expenditure  0.30  0.00  0.30  0.03       \n  Base cost  27.15  14.00  5.90  7.33      \n \n  Taxes and Duties  3.80        3.80    \n30.95  14.00  5.90  7.33 \nTotal Project Costs  3.80    \nFinancing Plan    14.00  13.18  3.80    \nFinancing Percentage    45.23%  42.58%  12.28%   \n                          \nAusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.  \nNotes:  \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describes how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nSri Lanka's poverty reduction strategy is included in the 10-year development framework (10YDF) 2006\u20132016, Mahinda \nChintana. ADB's country partnership strategy (CPS) 2009\u20132011 for Sri Lanka, approved in 2008, is aligned to the framework \nand the program for the next 3 years is focused on the government's priority areas. ADB\u2019s strategy focuses on the two pillars \nidentified  in  the  framework.  These  are  (i)  strengthening  the  investment  climate,  and  (ii)  achieving  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment.  The  first  pillar  deals  with  infrastructure  development  and  human  resource  development  to  improve \ncompetitiveness.  The  second  pillar  focuses  on  regional  disparities  and  looks  at  development  of  infrastructure  and \nadministrative and absorptive capacity in the poorer regions to improve the delivery of public services.    \n \nComprehensive poverty data is not available for Northern and Eastern provinces. However, poverty in the former conflict \nareas is significant, with government figures indicating the poverty incidence at around 37%, well over twice the national \naverage but still likely to be an underestimate. Destruction of assets and infrastructure, displacement, loss of life and \nlivelihood, and destruction of the social fabric characterize the poverty situation in these areas, setting it apart from rest of the \ncountry. The 10-year development framework has a separate chapter on the conflict-affected areas and states that the current \npolicies are designed to protect and resettle displaced communities and to reconstruct the economic and physical and social \ninfrastructure with the aim of assuring sustained long-term development of Northern and Eastern provinces. With the ending \nof military operations in May 2009, reconstruction and development of the former conflict areas has become a priority for the \ngovernment. In May 2009 the government formulated a development plan for Northern province, similar to the one developed \nfor Eastern provinces as the government gained full control of that province. This is a 3-year plan, which looks at the same \nissues discussed in the Mahinda Chintana. \n  \nThrough this proposed supplementary loan to NECORD II, ADB will support the government's efforts to meet basic human \nneeds, particularly of the returning IDPs, and assist them in restarting their livelihood activities through the reconstruction of \nessential community and social infrastructure damaged by the conflict. The emphasis will be on helping to reestablish the civil \nadministration, basic health care and education services as well as support for rural electrification schemes, minor access \nroads, minor irrigation, community water supply, and vocational and skills training for livelihood development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                  Targeting Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe civil conflict over 3 decades has severely affected the communities in these areas. Loss of life, livelihoods, incomes, and \nproperty  has  resulted  in  significant  socioeconomic  and  psychological  stress.  In  the  conflict-affected  areas,  essential \ninvestments have not been made for a long time. \n \nThe project will meet basic human needs by reestablishing vital services such as fisheries and irrigation infrastructure, health \nand educational facilities, water supply, agricultural support services, and institutions to revive economic activities. This will \nlead to employment, income generation, rehabilitation of displaced persons, and restoration of social stability in these areas.  \n \nImprovement of services and infrastructure will also encourage people to return to their original villages and settlements. With \nthis end in view, the project will strengthen health and educational facilities, while bolstering local institutions. Community-\nbased organizations will be established and supported, saving will be encouraged, women will be made more self-reliant, \nmicrocredit will be introduced, and recreational facilities will be provided.  \n                               \nIn Northern and Eastern provinces, the people affected by the conflict are especially vulnerable because of gender, age, \ndisability, and general breakdown in their traditional livelihood systems. Internally displaced persons who wish to return to \ntheir areas of origin need support in reestablishing their homes and their livelihoods. Essential services such as schools, \nhospitals, clinics, water, and power supply are lacking in these areas. The neglect of minor irrigation schemes has constrained \nagricultural production. Onetime surplus food production areas have become food-deficit areas. Livestock numbers have \n ", " 62  Appendix 15 \ndeclined. In general, the provinces have suffered extensive dislocation and economic progress has been hampered. These \nproblems were exacerbated by the 2004 tsunami through loss of lives and property. Livelihoods, especially of fishers, have \nbeen destroyed. The psychological trauma from the loss of lives has been tremendous. \n \nThe people in the project areas face major challenges in terms of basic human needs: shelter, employment and livelihoods, \naccess to services (education, health, agricultural support services, irrigation, markets, and power supply), and community-\nbased institutions.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe beneficiaries of the project are a war-affected population that had suffered loss of family members, displacement, loss of \nproperty, lack of access to essential social services, and long years of violence and insecurity. Income levels and human \ndevelopment indicators for these areas are among the gravest in Sri Lanka. The conflict and lack of security were the principal \ncause for poverty and the most binding constraint to poverty reduction and economic development. Poverty in these areas is \ndue to war-related destruction of property and life, which has set back these regions from where they were prior to the war, \nand lack of development over the last 30 years. Restrictions on movement of people and taking over of property by parties to \nthe war have interrupted traditional livelihoods including in agriculture and fisheries. The needs of these communities are \nmanifold. It consists of rebuilding and restoration of infrastructure and systems, establishing community life in certain areas, \nprovision of basic social services, and connecting these regions with the rest of the country.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations were done with relevant government stakeholders and other development partners to identify needs and outline \nthe  scope  of  the  project.  As  IDPs  (internally  displaced  persons)  are  in  the  process  of  returning,  consultations  with \nbeneficiaries is limited. Beneficiary consultation and participation will be facilitated in subproject selection and implementation, \nwhere possible. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing       Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes     No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.).  \nAs the project was processed as an emergency loan, a C&P plan was not prepared.   \n \nMuch  of  the  project  will  be  implemented  through  stakeholder  consultation,  using  a  bottom-up  approach.  Subproject \nformulation, design, and selection will be through community consultation. Local participation in the implementation of \nsubprojects will be encouraged as appropriate. This process has proven highly successful in other ongoing rehabilitation \nprojects in Northern and Eastern provinces.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Decades of conflict have devastated community and family life in Northern and \nEastern provinces. Vulnerable groups, including war widows, households headed by women, single women with elderly \ndependents, elderly, and disabled persons, have increased disproportionately in these provinces. This presents significant \nchallenges in these communities where women traditionally have many other disadvantages\u2014women have had to be the \nprovider as well as the caregiver for the family. The project provides opportunities for both women and men to have access to \nbasic facilities, and to restart or initiate livelihoods and micro or small enterprise activities. While the project will support \ninternally displaced persons who have returned to their original habitats, the project will identify and target vulnerable groups, \nsuch as war widows, households headed by women, single women, in the project area in the provision of shelter and training \nin livelihood-related skills, and access to credit and technical support. The aim is to enable them to improve their economic \nstrength and contribute to the enhanced well-being of their families. The project will engage with and also strengthen the \ncapacity of local CBOs and local nongovernment organizations, especially women's NGOs, enabling them to act as a \nresource on gender awareness and skills development, and assist in and monitor gender-related project activities. \n \n2.

The objectives of the gender action plan (GAP) are to promote and enable the equal \nparticipation of men and women stakeholders as agents and beneficiaries of the North East \nCommunity Restoration and Development (NECORD) Project II supplementary loan. The GAP \nis  based  on  the  analysis  that  women  are  disadvantaged  and  discriminated  against  in \nsociocultural, economic, and political spheres of life; and they are denied equal access to \nresources, services, and opportunities that would enable them to participate in, contribute to, \nand benefit fully from development processes in the country. 1 The project will encourage and \nsupport the increased participation of women in needs assessment and consultation, as well as \nin planning and implementing activities in different sectors through the components of NECORD \nII supplementary loan. The GAP will give particular attention to \n(i)  the equal participation of and benefit to women and men in urban and village \nreconstruction and development activities and processes;  \n(ii)  the recovery of livelihood and economic activities for both women and men, with \nspecial  attention  paid  to  the  introduction  of  and  support  for  livelihood  and \nenterprise activities for war widows, households headed by women, and single \nwomen with elderly dependents in the project areas; and \n(iii)  the equal access of women and men to infrastructure activities in relation to \nplanning and construction, as users and in maintenance. \n \n2.  The  GAP  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  and  planned  implementation \nmechanisms  for  NECORD  II.  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  training.  Consultants  and  consulting  agency  services  will  be  engaged,  where \nnecessary, to enable the effective implementation of the GAP. \n \nTable A15: Gender Action Plan \n \nSector  Outputs  Targets \nHealth     \nHealth facilities   About 45 medical facilities to cover more  Ensure that health facilities cater to \nthan 120,000 families, restored  the special physical and psychological \nHIV/AIDS campaign  \nneeds of conflict-affected men, \nAwareness on HIV/AIDS raised among \nwomen, children, the elderly and the \nmore than 5,000 families and \ndisabled. \nconstruction workers  \nEnsure wage parity for male and \nfemale labor in reconstruction of \nhealth facilities. \nEnsure that the health facilities have \nseparate units for STI and HIV/AIDS \nand psychological care providing \ninformation, testing services, and \ntreatment. \nRecruit women and men (from state \nand NGO sectors) with appropriate \nskills to deliver awareness and \nprevention training on HIV/AIDS to \ncontractors, construction personnel \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.
