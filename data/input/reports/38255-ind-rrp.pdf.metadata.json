The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nAssessment  framework  (EARF)  for  the  Uttaranchal  State-Road  Investment \nProgram (Investment Program) is in Appendix 8. The summary \nenvironmental impact assessment report for Project 1 and the \nEARF were submitted to the Board and publicly disclosed through \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Website on 17 July 2006. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  Investment  Program  is  a  multi-year  program  of  financial \nDescription  support  for  the  road  subsector  in  the  state  of  Uttaranchal  to \nimplement part of its road development plan, and to increase the \nroad  asset  management  capacity  of  the  state\u2019s  Public  Works \nDepartment  (PWD).  The  Investment  Program  will  provide \nfinancing for seven discrete investment projects, which will be \nimplemented sequentially over 10 years. Each project will have \ntwo  main  components  as  needed:  infrastructure  improvement \n(physical  investment)  and  infrastructure  management \n(nonphysical  investment).  The  main  collective  outputs  of  the \nseven  projects  would  be  (i)  10,800  kilometers  (km)  of  state \nroads\u2014about two thirds of PWD\u2019s network\u2014improved; and (ii) \nenhanced accountability and transparency of PWD. \n \nThe first Project (Project 1) of the Investment Program is designed \nto  help  the  State  of  Uttaranchal  (Uttaranchal)  (i)  improve  a \nsubnetwork  of  roads,  totaling  about  570  km,  for  which  pre-\nconstruction activities have been completed; (ii) initiate business \nprocess  reengineering  of  PWD;  and  (iii)  increase  PWD  staff\u2019s \nasset management skills. \n \nSupport for business process reengineering will include updates, \nwhere necessary, to operating manuals, operationalization of the \nmanagement  information  and  project  management  system \n(MIPMS),  and  mainstreaming  of  strategic  planning  and  new \nprocedures.  Staff  skills  will  be  improved  through  a  long-term \neducation  and  training  program  in  leading-edge  road \ninfrastructure management techniques. Awareness and skills of \nthe state road builders will also be enhanced. \n \nThe Investment Program has a special feature to introduce a new \nmethod of works procurement. With this method, performance- \n \n ", "ii   \n \nbased  contracts  (PBC)  will  be  used  to  procure  physical \nimprovements and 3 consecutive years of maintenance thereafter. \nThis method, which will be used for the first time by a state in \nIndia  in  an  externally  funded  project,  will  increase  the \nsustainability of the road network. In addition to savings in road \nmaintenance  costs,  the  benefits  of  PBCs  include  increased \nopportunities for private sector involvement. Cost savings would \nbe derived from economies of scale and lower prices in return for \nlong-term work assurances for contractors.  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  ADB's financial support will be extended through a multitranche \nFacility  financing facility (the Facility). \n \nThe  Facility  will  be  provided  in  tranches  to  support  separate \nprojects  of  the  Investment  Program  when  they  are  ready  for \nfinancing, provided that India and Uttaranchal are in compliance \nwith the assurances to ADB, and the investments are in line with \nthe framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \nEach tranche may be financed under terms different from those of \nprevious or subsequent tranches. The choice of financing terms \nwill depend on the project, and ADB's financing policies at the \ntime the tranche is legally documented. \n \nIf India requests from ADB any cofinancing or related assistance \nfor the projects from the Facility, ADB may assist, subject to its \nrelated policies and procedures. \n   \nRationale for the Facility  More than 90% of intra- and intercity freight and passenger traffic \nin Uttaranchal moves by road. However, about 30% of the main \narterials (state highways and major district roads) and more than \n70% of the collector and distributor roads (other district roads and \nvillage  roads)\u2014about  65%  of  the  road  network  under  the \njurisdiction of PWD\u2014need to be repaired or rehabilitated. The \nprimary reasons for the poor condition of the road network are \ninefficient  road  asset  management  (planning,  budgeting,  and \nsupervision) and inadequate funding. \n \nIndia  and  Uttaranchal  envision  a  reduction  in  poverty  and  an \nincrease in personal incomes by improving personal mobility and \naccessibility through increased investment in road infrastructure. \nThe  National  Highway Development Program (NHDP) and the \nPradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY)  Program  are \nimportant  features  of  the  India\u2019s  economic  development  and \npoverty  reduction  strategy.  Uttaranchal  has  prepared  a  road \ndevelopment  plan  (RDP)  to  guide  its  investment  in  roads. \nInvestments under the RDP include 7 sequential projects to be \nimplemented under this Facility between 2007 and 2017.  \n \nThe estimated cost of implementing the RDP is $1.2 billion.  \n ", "  iii\nAccording to the investment program in the RDP, an increase of \napproximately 80% in the current level of annual funding would be \nrequired  over  the  next  10  years.  While  improved  planning \nprocedures,  new  construction  and  maintenance  standards,  and \nincreased  supervision  and  monitoring  can  help  reduce  future \nexpenditure,  the  forecast  level  of  state  and  central  government \nfinancing would be inadequate to implement the RDP fully. More \nthan 90% of Uttaranchal\u2019s population and the two main drivers of \nthe economy\u2014agriculture and tourism\u2014depend on road transport \nfor intra- and intercity, as well as inter-village, conveyance. As such, \nfailure to implement fully the multi-project RDP would perpetuate \nrural  remoteness  and  poverty,  and  exacerbate  the  outward \nmigration of labor.  \n \nUttaranchal  is  committed  to  financing  the  RDP  through  a \ncombination  of  central,  state,  and  external  sources.  India  has \nrequested financial support from ADB to meet part of Uttaranchal\u2019s \nexternal  resource  needs,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  road  sector \nstrategy  for  India.  This  Investment  Program  has  been \nconceptualized  and  included  in  the  India  country  strategy  and \nprogram  update  (2006\u20132008)  to  help  Uttaranchal  achieve  its \npoverty reduction and economic development goals by financing \npart  of  the  infrastructure  and  institutional  capacity  development \ncosts of the RDP.  \n \nUttaranchal requires periodic funding in tranches corresponding to \nthe sequential projects of the RDP. A multitranche financing facility \nfrom  ADB  is  best  suited  to  meet  this  need.  It  would  allow \nUttaranchal  to  commit  to  its  multi-year  investment  plans  with  a \ndegree  of  certainty  about  the  source  of  financing,  and  borrow \nincrementally  according  to  the  development  road  map.  Such  a \nfacility  also  would  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to \ndevelopment, while closely monitoring progress of the road network \nand guiding development on a project-by-project basis. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will have an incremental, positive long-\nterm impact on Uttaranchal\u2019s economy and living standards of the \nrural population. The principal outcomes of the physical investments \nunder the Investment Program will be increased efficiency, safety, \ncomfort, and reliability of inter- and intra-state transport services, \nand lower road maintenance costs. The nonphysical investments of \nthe program would lead to (i) increased satisfaction among road \nusers;  (ii)  more  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation;  (iii) \nmore synergy benefits for the parallel road development programs; \nand  (iv)  improved  governance.  Together,  the  investments  would \nincrease  mobility  and  accessibility  to  educational  and  health \nservices, employment opportunities, and markets for the community \nand enterprises in rural and urban areas of Uttaranchal.   \n \n \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nCost Estimates  The Investment Program is estimated to cost $830.0 million. The \ncost of Project 1 is estimated at $74.0 million.   \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nSource  Total  % \nInvestment Program:     \nAsian Development Bank  550.0  66 \nIndia  280.0  34 \nTotal  830.0  100 \n     \nProject 1     \nAsian Development Bank  50.0  68 \nIndia  24.0  32 \n Total  74.0  100 \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The maximum financing amount available under the Facility is $550 \nFacility Amount and  million. It will be provided in individual tranches from ADB\u2019s ordinary \nTerms  capital resources.  \n \nEach tranche will be no less than $50 million, and will be used to \nfinance  infrastructure  development  and  capacity  development \nneeds identified under each Project. India will provide the proceeds \nof the loans under the Facility in local currency to Uttaranchal on \nterms  and  conditions  applicable  to  its  own  lending  modalities.\n \nUttaranchal will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loans. \n \nIndia will cause the proceeds of each tranche to be applied by \nUttaranchal to finance expenditures of the Investment Program, in \naccordance  with  conditions  set  forth  in  the  FFA  and  the  legal \nagreements for each tranche. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The last date on which any disbursements under any tranche may \nbe made will be 31 December 2017. The last periodic financing \nrequest (PFR) is expected to be submitted no later than 1 May \n2012. The availability period will lapse 12 months from the date of \nADB Board approval of the Facility, unless by such time the legal \nagreements for the first tranche under the Facility are signed and \nmade effective. \n   \nExecuting Agency  PWD  \n   \nImplementation  Uttaranchal has established a project management unit (PMU) to \nArrangements  monitor, evaluate, report, and serve as its representative for the \nInvestment Program. Site-level management of works and related \nactivities of each contract package will be assigned to one or more \nproject implementation units (PIUs). The PIUs will be reporting to \nthe project director of the PMU.   \n \nA steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of Uttaranchal, \nand comprising the secretary of PWD and secretaries of key state  \n ", "  v \nagencies,  has  been  set  up  to  monitor  the  implementation  of \nInvestment  Program.  It  will  be  functional  within  3  months  of \neffectiveness of the first loan.  \n \nA road board chaired by the secretary of PWD, and comprising key \nroad sector stakeholders, will be established to serve as a medium \nfor gaining the perspective of road users and sharing information on \nthe outcomes of the Investment Program. \n \nStarting from Project 2, the PMU will prepare and appraise projects \naccording to the frameworks and safeguards agreed with ADB. ADB \nthen will conduct a due diligence analysis of each appraised project \nand the corresponding PFR. The PMU will finalize PFR, with any \nmodifications and revisions required by ADB, and submit to ADB \nthrough India. \n \nAs  the  Executing  Agency,  PWD,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will \nengage  independent  external  firms  to  conduct  annual  financial \naudits  of  project  and  investment  program  accounts  and \nprocurement,  in  keeping  with  its  commitment  to  increase \ntransparency and good governance.   \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of works to be financed from the Facility will be carried \nout using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures and post-\nqualification  method,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006), as described in the procurement plan for \nthe Investment Program as amended from time to time (Appendix \n7).  The  procurement  plan  may  be  revised  and  amended,  as \nnecessary, during implementation of the Investment Program. The \nmaximum amount of a civil works contract procured through NCB \nprocedures will be set initially at $10.0 million, and will be reviewed \nduring implementation.  \n \nAll works will be procured under PBCs. ADB\u2019s standard review and \napproval procedure will be used for procurement in Projects 1 and 2 \nof the Investment Program. PWD will submit the documentation, as \nspecified in the Guidelines, for ADB\u2019s review and approval before \nawarding  the  Procurement  contracts.  ADB  may  allow  post  facto \napproval  procedures  starting  with  Project  3,  if  Uttaranchal  is \ndeemed to have followed satisfactorily the procedures in Projects 1 \nand 2.  \n   \nAdvance Contracting  Management  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nand Retroactive  financing for projects to be financed from the Facility. \nFinancing \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be used for design and construction supervision of \nall roads, and for technical and other specialist support to the PMU. \nPWD  will  engage  program  support  consultants  individually  or \nthrough consulting companies. Supervision consultants in Project 1 \nwould provide about 1,000 person-months of inputs. In addition,  \n ", "vi \n  PWD  would  procure  about  90  person-months  of  services  from \nprogram  support  consultants.  The  consultants  financed  from  the \nFacility would be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time), and other arrangements for recruitment of national \nconsultants acceptable to ADB. \n   \nBenefits and  The  main  immediate  benefit  streams  of  the  Investment  Program \nBeneficiaries  include  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  travel  time,  and \nmaintenance  costs  stemming  from  the  physical  improvements. \nHowever, a large part of the road network lies in rolling terrain at high \naltitudes, which makes the costs of construction and maintenance \ngenerally higher than in level terrain. As such, the net benefits in the \ninitial years are not expected to be high. Moreover, many direct and \nindirect  benefits  from  the  nonphysical  parts  of  the  Investment \nProgram  are  not  expected  until  the  latter  years.  These  benefits \ninclude (i) systematic planning and programming; (ii) staff training; \n(iii) improved financial management and governance; and (iv) PBCs. \nThe  adoption  of  PBCs  can  generate  savings  of  up  to  20%. \nAdditionally, PBCs would encourage innovations in materials and \nequipment. \n \nDespite the relatively small benefits, as well as the high cost of \nphysical works due to terrain conditions, the economic rate of return \nof Project 1 is 16.3%, and the net present value at a 12% discount \nrate is $14.4 million equivalent. The poverty impact ratio of Project 1 \nis 0.30.  \n \nThe roads to be improved under the Investment Program are spread \nacross all 13 districts of the state, and would be accessible to about \n3.5  million  people  living  in  adjacent  villages.  The  physical  works \nplanned under the Investment Program will require about 8.4 million \nperson-days of input.  Project 1 would require about 900,000 person-\ndays of direct input from unskilled workers. Moreover, about $7.5 \nmillion in benefits would accrue to road users in the form of travel \ntime savings from Project 1. \n   \nRisks and  The main risk of poor performance of the Investment Program arises \nAssumptions  from possible project preparation delays, implementation delays, and \nlow  quality  of  physical  outputs.  To  minimize  this  risk,  ADB  has \nagreed on a feasible schedule and a systematic procedure for PFR \nsubmissions. Projects have been scheduled and sequenced to allow \nthe capacity enhancement initiatives, including staff training, to take \neffect. Consultant support is provided to PWD to help anticipate the \nfactors in the critical paths of project implementation schedules, and \nto take advance contracting to minimize such delays. The planned \nengagement  of  consultants  for  supervision  of  works,  safeguard \nmonitoring, and the opportunities to select contractors from a larger \npool due to the increased size of the contract packages will reduce \nthe risk of poor quality. \n ", "(cid:55)(cid:56)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (the Facility) to India for the Uttaranchal State-Road Investment \nProgram1 (Investment Program).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Uttaranchal\u2019s  transportation  system,  comprising  road,  rail,  and  air,  does  not  meet \nadequately the current demand for intra- and intercity passenger and freight movement. Air and \nrail transport serve the intercity market, while road transport serves both interstate and intrastate \nmarkets. The only scheduled air service2 is between the state capital Dehradun and New Delhi, \nand is infrequent and unreliable. Roads connecting the four rail termini inside the southern \nfringe of the state are inadequate to offer intermodal or multimodal freight and passenger \nservices. Consequently, more than 90% of the passenger and freight traffic moves by road. \n \n3.   The road network is made up of about 36,000 kilometers (km) of links ranging from two-\nlane highways to foot paths. Public investment in roads has risen from about $91 million in 2001 \nto $150 million in 2006. Yet, about a quarter of the state\u2019s small villages and habitations are \nunconnected or only seasonally connected to collector and distributor roads. The Public Works \nDepartment (PWD) of Uttaranchal is responsible for planning, designing, constructing, and \nmaintaining about 17,000 km of the network roads,3 of which about 7% are built to two-lane \nstandards and around 60% are paved. PWD performs routine maintenance, and all capital \nworks are outsourced to private contractors through competitive bidding. The average service \nlife of a rehabilitated road has remained between 3 and 4 years, about half the international \nbenchmark, largely due to the poor construction and maintenance.  \n \n4.  About 30% of the main arterials (state highways and major district roads) and more than \n70% of the collector and distributor roads (other district roads and village roads)\u2014about two \nthirds of PWD\u2019s network\u2014need to be repaired or rehabilitated. The poor surface condition, \ncoupled with low capacity due to the narrow alignments in hilly terrain, seasonal traversability of \nroads at higher altitudes, and increasing traffic, is causing speed and reliability of transport \nservices to decline gradually. The resulting delays are limiting the growth of the agriculture \nsector in particular, which contributes one third of the state\u2019s net domestic product and employs \n58%  of  the  workforce.  Reportedly,  around  75%  of  the  state\u2019s  fresh  produce  reaches  the \nmarkets. The tourism industry, which depends heavily on visitors to some of the country\u2019s most \nrevered shrines in the northern parts of the state, also is suffering due to the lack of year-round \naccess to those locations. Consequently, the earning potential of small farmers and businesses \nremains low, and poverty persists in the rural areas. \n \n5.  Vehicle registration data shows that the number of motor vehicles has increased at an \naverage annual rate of about 15% since 2001. The rise in the two- and three-wheelers in the \ncities and townships has fueled a large part of that increase. At the end of January 2006, the   \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Introduced in 2004. \n3  Comprising 437 km of state roads, 1,369 km of major district roads, 6,910 km of other district roads, 5,631 km of \nlight vehicle roads, and 2,633 km of village roads.  \n ", "2   \n \nnumber of registered vehicles in the state had reached about 650,000, with two- and three-\nwheelers accounting for more than three quarters of that total. State agencies have indicated \ncorresponding increases in network traffic in the past 3 years. The average daily traffic on \nselected roads, estimated from 7-day counts taken during the Investment Program preparation,4 \nranged from 100 to 700. This confirms that volume is correlated to road quality (i.e., some major \ndistrict and other district roads in better condition carry more traffic than the higher class state \nhighways in poor condition), not the class of road.   \n \n6.  State authorities have reported that road freight and passenger services are available in \nmore parts of the state than in 2001. While freight transport operators in the state are entirely \nprivate, the State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC) and private operators provide passenger \nservices. Service quality offered by private operators is not significantly different from SRTC\u2019s \nservices.  SRTC  provides  mostly  line-haul  services  on  35  major  routes  using  conventional \nbuses, while private operators, under a regime of permits issued by state transport authorities, \nprovide both line-haul and door-to-door services using pickup trucks. SRTC has published fare \nschedules and timetables, while private operators\u2019 services are unscheduled, \u201con-demand\u201d, \ncostlier, and also carry freight. Surveys conducted as part of Investment Program preparation \nhave showed that, even on routes operated by SRTC, passengers rely more on costlier private \ntransport due to the low frequency of SRTC services. The higher fares of private operators, \nmany of whom are individual vehicle owners, are partly a result of the added convenience of \nmore direct services. In addition, the permits, which limit the number of passengers that each \noperator can carry and the routes on which they can operate, also contribute to the higher fares. \nVehicle owners have formed associations in their operating areas to lobby Uttaranchal for better \nroads, more flexible permits, and lower taxes to enable them to increase capacity and improve \nthe quality of service. \n \n7.  Intercity  freight  is  transported  in  two-axle  trucks,  which  constitute  the  bulk  of  the \ncommercial vehicles registered in the state. An increase in multi-axle vehicles has been noted \non state highways since the introduction of the axle-based taxes in 2005. Field observations, \nsurveys, and personal interviews have indicated that demand for intercity freight services is \nsignificantly higher than the supply. Specialized vehicles, such as freezer trucks and semi-trailer \ntrucks, are in particularly short supply. This, in concert with rising fuel prices, poor condition of \nroad surfaces, accidents, and inadequate financing for truck owners, has caused the cost of \nroad transport to rise substantially in the past 2 years. Nationally, transport costs on average \naccount for nearly one third of the total product cost, compared with 10% or less in more \ndeveloped countries. This incremental factor cost constrains the expansion of rural industries \nand the progress of rural communities. A detailed analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix \n2. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.   Constraints \n   \n8.  Despite the extensive length of the network, the road subsector has been unable to \ncontribute adequately to economic growth due to the inadequacy of transport services between \nhabitations and centers of economic and social activity. The relative inadequacy of the transport \nservices is caused by the (i) hilly and rolling terrain; (ii) poor condition of the existing network \nroads; and (iii) missing links. Road transport is the only viable mode due to the terrain, which \n                                                 \n4  The Investment Program was prepared between November 2005 and May 2006 with ADB support: ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to India for Uttaranchal State Roads. Manila (TA 4607, approved on 1 July, for $208,000).  ", "  3\nalso  limits  the  directness  of  routes.  However,  the  present  approach  to  road  infrastructure \nmanagement has to be modified to improve the road conditions and provide the missing links.  \n \n9.  Infrastructure management can be improved by better strategic state-wide planning. \nCurrently, PWD\u2019s divisions (lowest operational level) are responsible for road development \nprogramming and budgeting. Those programs and budgets are transmitted through the circle \nand zone channels (the next higher administrative levels) to the office of the head of PWD. The \nhead of PWD collates this information into an annual capital works and routine maintenance \nfunding request, which is submitted to the state. The budget that the state approves is allocated \nto the divisions in proportion to the requests. However, capital works receive a higher priority \nthan maintenance of existing roads.  \n \n10.  Procurement procedures are another infrastructure management constraint. Although \nprocurement is based on competitive bidding, the method of packaging works does not offer \nincentives, such as assurances of future work opportunities, which allow contractors to develop \nand improve quality. Contracts, typically valued between $0.2 million and $1.0 million, have \nattracted only local contractors. This has prevented PWD from achieving economies of scale \nand  developing  local  contractors\u2019  capacity.  Inadequate  supervision  of  contractors,  lack  of \nmonitoring of asset performance based on consistent standards and specifications, and the vast \ngeographical scope of the operational zones also have affected the road network condition.  A \ndetailed assessment of the constraints and their implications are in Appendix 3. \n \n2.   Opportunities \n \n11.  Inefficient transport and communications infrastructure increases transaction costs and \nconstrains the national economy from realizing its full potential. As part of the strategy for \nimproving  transport  sector  performance,  India  has  initiated  a  balanced  program  of  road \nsubsector development under the 10th Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007), which will continue under \nthe 11th Five Year Plan (2008\u20132012). The program aims to increase the capacity of the road \nnetwork, as well as improve (i) maintenance of rural roads, (ii) road safety, (iii) riding quality of \nnational highways, (iv) rural connectivity with all-weather roads, and (v) access to intermodal \nterminals.  The two main components of that program are the National Highway Development \nProgram (NHDP),5 and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Program.6  \n \n12.  Uttaranchal\u2019s vision to \u201creach a level of economic development that would generate \nemployment and income opportunities for its people to achieve a good quality of life and social \nprogress while preserving the environment and nature.\u201d7 Towards this end, Uttaranchal has \nannounced an infrastructure plan to (i) double per capita income, (ii) halve the population living \nin poverty, (iii) arrest the migration of workers, and (iv) provide universal access to electricity \nand safe drinking water. The plan envisages investments in key components of the state\u2019s \ninfrastructure  system  to  stimulate  agriculture,  industry,  and  service  industries;  and  create \nemployment opportunities.  \n                                                 \n5  Announced in 1998, NHDP was intended to upgrade 13,146 km to multi-lane standards between 2001 and 2007. It \nwas expanded in February 2005 to seven phases. Phases III through VII are intended to upgrade an additional \n45,000 km, and add a 1,000 km of new expressways, between 2005 and 2012. \n6  The program was initiated in 2000 by the Government of India with the aim of providing all-weather access from \nmain thoroughfares to rural settlements with more than 250 people by constructing and improving the previously \nused foot paths and village roads.   \n7  Uttaranchal: a state on the move. Additional Secretary & Infrastructure Development Commissioner, State of \nUttaranchal.  \n ", "4   \n \n13.   Uttaranchal\u2019s  vision  for  road  infrastructure  is  \u201crapid  and  social  upliftment  of  the \npopulation while simultaneously ensuring balanced regional development and spreading the \naccruing benefits evenly over all sections of the society.\u201d8 To realize this vision, Uttaranchal \nformulated a draft road policy in 2005 with the objective of creating a road network that would \nprovide  (i)  high-speed  connectivity  with  the  rest  of  the  country,  (ii)  adequate  and  efficient \nconnectivity to all the demand drivers (tourism, industries, agriculture, and urban centers), (iii) \nconnectivity to all villages and/or habitations through roads and bridges, and (v) year-round \nservice. The relevant state ministries are reviewing the draft road policy. The policy emphasizes \npreserving road network investments through asset maintenance strategies, including the wider \nuse of performance-based contracts (PBC); and developing the capacity of PWD to support the \npolicy objectives.   \n \n14.  The draft road policy will be implemented through the road development plan (RDP) \nprepared by PWD in November 2005. The RDP outlines a multi-project program of physical \nimprovements and maintenance strategies designed to (i) surface all network roads that are not \nsurfaced; (ii) upgrade safety features on roads to meet Indian Roads Congress standards; (iii) \nprovide road links to all social facilities that are more than 1.5 km from any habitation; (iv) \nprovide road links to all tourist centers and 60%\u201370% of pilgrimage centers; (v) maintain 85% of \nthe network roads in good condition by 2015; and (vi) outsource all maintenance works on a \ncompetitive basis through PBCs. \n \n15.  A study commissioned by PWD in 2005 demonstrated that substantial economies of \nscale can be gained from a well-executed RDP that is supported by stable, long-term financing. \nAccordingly, Uttaranchal intends to finance capital costs through external borrowings, and divert \na higher portion of the state\u2019s funds to asset preservation. To boost preservation efforts, state \ntaxes on multi-axel vehicles have been lowered with the intent of encouraging the replacement \nof two-axle vehicles by the more \u201cpavement-friendly\u201d multi-axel vehicles, which cause a quarter \nof the damage. The improvements to roads would encourage the shift to multi-axle trucks due to \nthe expected lowering of operating costs and increased maneuverability.  \n \n16.  Uttaranchal expects the RDP to increase the benefits of past and future investment \nunder four national road development programs,9 which depend on the level of the connectivity \nprovided  to  them  through  the  state  highways  and  district  roads.  Of  those  four  programs, \nPMGSY has enabled people in 60% of the 15,672 villages in the state to gain access to a main \nthoroughfare by direct or indirect all-weather links (paved roads). Another 1,935 villages have \nbeen  identified  for  connections,  of  which  472  connections  have  been  sanctioned  by  the \nGovernment of India. At the end of April 2006, 93 villages had been connected, and the rest \nwere expected to be connected by 2010.  \n \n17.  Parts  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  2,107  km10 national  highway  network  that  radiate  from  the \nsouthwest to the main commercial centers are scheduled to be upgraded or improved under \nPhases III and IV of the NHDP. Phase III civil works are expected to be completed by 2010. \nThat will upgrade a 120 km section of National Highway 72, connecting Delhi and Dehradun, to \nfour-lane divided highway standards. Under Phase IV, another 640 km of single-lane national \nhighways will be upgraded to two-lane standards, and 780 km of two-lane national highways will \nbe repaired or rehabilitated.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Infrastructure Vision.

", "  5\n18.  Senior  management  of  PWD  is  strongly  committed  to  implementing  capacity \ndevelopment  measures  needed  to  improve  asset  performance.  An  agreement  has  been \nreached to establish a road board to increase stakeholder participation and transparency of \nPWD operations. The State has approved establishing a central planning unit under the chief \nengineer, with a head of division and technical and administrative staff for (i) reviewing and \nupdating the RDP according to input from the divisions and circles; (ii) setting performance \nstandards; and (iii) monitoring infrastructure performance.  \n \n19.  Uttaranchal\u2019s commitment to procuring works through PBCs demonstrates a greater \nemphasis on asset preservation. PWD has a broad understanding of the underlying direct \nbenefits of PBCs. Fundamental to the success of the RDP, these benefits stem from reductions \nin (i) risk and the number of contract variations common in conventional contracts, (ii) in-house \nstaff and equipment, and (iii) single-period plans and programs. In developed and developing \ncountries, PBCs have achieved 10%\u201320% savings and encouraged technological innovation in \nthe form of new materials and equipment. PWD also is aware of the initial challenges of setting \nperformance standards, and contractor evaluation and monitoring. Further, it is willing to take \nthe necessary action to overcome these challenges, as stated in Uttaranchal\u2019s transport policy. \nPWD is confident of rapidly acquiring the experience to engage professional contractors on a \nlong-term basis to build and maintain good roads at predetermined standards to provide greater \ncustomer satisfaction.  \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n20.  Improving  the  physical  condition  of  roads  must  be  supplemented  by  nonphysical \nmeasures to enhance operational efficiency, such as (i) improved driver licensing procedures; \n(ii) awareness campaigns; (iii) increased enforcement of traffic laws; and (iv) emissions control.  \nMoreover, improved roads cannot meet the mobility needs, or fill the mobility gaps, without \nbetter  road  transport and modal integration. In particular, the development of the logistics \nindustry and provision of intermodal transportation facilities will be needed in the future to derive \nthe full benefits of the investment in road improvements. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill conduct a regular policy dialogue with the Executing Agency on these issues, and continue \nto  review  and  assist  Uttaranchal\u2019s  efforts  in  key  areas  that  emerge  from  the  dialogue. \nAssistance will be provided through specific components of future projects in the road map and \nInvestment Program.  \n \n4.  ADB Strategy and Lessons Learned \n \n21.  In the past 5 years, ADB\u2019s support to the road sector in India (Supplementary Appendix \n1) has taken the form of project and sector loans to advance development programs for the \nnational (NHDP), state, and rural (PMGSY) road network. The NHDP aims to increase mobility \nthrough the provision of better roads, while the state and rural roads programs seek to increase \naccessibility. Support for developing the capacity of road agencies is also a main component of \nADB\u2019s overall transportation strategy in India. Since 2000, ADB has provided five loans to assist \nwith the first two phases of the NHDP, which sought to increase safety and capacity of the \nintercity highways. ADB is now focusing on the subsequent phases (NHDP III, IV, V, VI, and \nVII), which are estimated to cost around $40 billion. ADB recently provided support for state \nroad  network  development  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Chhattisgarh.  In  2005,  a  facility  was \nprovided for the Rural Roads II Program.11 Such support, provided through loans and technical \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "6   \n \nassistance grants, has helped the agencies12 restructure and improve the management and \npreservation of road assets, including new assets.   \n \n22.  In developing its support for the road subsector, ADB has collaborated closely other \nexternal funding agencies active in the transport sector in India. ADB and the World Bank have \nadopted a coordinated strategy for the road sector, which was prepared in March 2001 and \nupdated in January 2002. Following this strategy, regular tripartite meetings are held with the \nGovernment to discuss road policy issues. ADB also meets regularly with its development \npartners, shares experiences, and coordinates investment programs.   \n \n23.  The implementation of ADB-financed road development projects in India over the past 5 \nyears have been delayed due largely to lengthy environmental and social safeguard approval \nprocesses. In particular, the need for full payment of compensation to affected persons and \ncomplete  clearance  of  the  site  before  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  have  delayed \nimplementation. The Investment Program is classified as environmental category A, Involuntary \nResettlement  impact  category  A, and Indigenous Peoples category B, according to ADB\u2019s \nclassification criteria. However, improvements to the 10,800 km of roads under the Investment \nProgram are not expected to have irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts, \nwhich would require mitigation measures or extensive monitoring that cause delays. Further, it \nwill  not  require  significant  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  of  persons,  and  will  not  affect \nindigenous peoples.   \n \n  5.  Need for ADB Support for the Investment Program \n \n24.  According to the RDP, approximately $120 million of additional annual funding, above \nthe current budget, will be needed in the next 10 years to meet the road condition targets. While \nimproved planning and budgeting procedures, new construction and maintenance standards, \nand increased supervision and monitoring can help reduce future expenditures, the forecast \nlevel of state and central government financing would be inadequate to implement fully the \nRDP. More than 90% of Uttaranchal\u2019s population and the two main drivers of the economy\u2014\nagriculture and tourism\u2014depend on road transport for intra- and intercity, as well as inter-\nvillage, conveyance. As such, failure to implement fully the multi-project RDP would perpetuate \nrural remoteness and poverty, and exacerbate the outward migration of labor. Uttaranchal, \ntherefore, plans to finance the RDP through a combination of central,13 state, and external \nsources. \n \n25.  India has requested financial support from ADB to meet Uttaranchal\u2019s external resource \nneeds, in accordance with ADB\u2019s road sector strategy for India. The Investment Program has \nbeen conceptualized and included in the India country strategy and program update (2006\u2013\n2008) to help Uttaranchal achieve its poverty reduction and economic development goals by \nfinancing part of the infrastructure and institutional capacity development costs of the RDP. \nUttaranchal requires periodic funding in tranches corresponding to the sequential projects of the \nRDP. A facility from ADB is best suited to meet this need. It would allow Uttaranchal to commit \nto its multiyear investment plans with a degree of certainty about the source of financing, and \nborrow  incrementally  according  to  the  development  road  map.  In  turn,  a  facility  would \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s long-term commitment to development, while closely monitoring progress of \nthe road network and guiding development on a project-by-project basis.  \n                                                 \n12  Public Works Departments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. \n13  Central sources include reallocation of state tax revenues, special grants, and budgetary allocations for special \ncategory states.  ", "  7\nIII.   THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Road Development Plan \n \n26.  The RDP is programmed for implementation as a series of seven discrete projects \nbetween 2007 and 2017, and specific capacity development initiatives. Its goal is to improve the \n16,800 km state-roads network to national standards, and maintain it in a good condition. The \nRDP  needs  an  investment  of  about  $1.2  billion  over  the  next  10  years.  The  proposed \nInvestment Program would finance part of the RDP. \n \nB.   Impact and Outcomes \n \n27.  The Investment Program will have a positive long-term impact on the state\u2019s economy \nand living standards of the rural population. The principal outcomes of the physical components \nunder the Investment Program will be increased efficiency, safety, comfort, and reliability of \ninter- and intrastate transport services, and lower road maintenance costs. The nonphysical \ncomponents of the Investment Program would lead to (i) increased satisfaction among road \nusers; (ii) more opportunities for private sector participation; (iii) more synergy benefits for the \nparallel  road  development  programs;  and  (iv)  improved  governance.  Together,  these \ninvestments  would  increase  mobility  and  accessibility  to  educational  and  health  services, \nemployment opportunities, and markets for the community and enterprises in rural and urban \nareas of the state.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n28.  The main outputs of the seven-project Investment Program would be (i) about 10,800 km \nof motorable state roads\u2014almost two thirds of the PWD network\u2014repaired or upgraded,14 and \nmaintained for a minimum of 3 years under PBCs; and (ii) a proactive and accountable PWD \nthat is better equipped to manage road infrastructure.   \n \n29.  Under the first project (Project 1) of the Investment Program, a subnetwork of 23 roads \ntotaling about 570 km would be improved and maintained. Pre-construction activities have been \ncompleted for Project 1. These physical improvements will increase the percentage of the state-\nroad network in good condition from 6% to 10% by 2008. The nonphysical outputs of Project 1 \nwould be (i) staff skilled in essential areas of road asset management; (ii) a fully functional \nplanning  unit  responsible  for  strategic-level  programming;  (iii)  a  road  board  to  increase \ntransparency and stakeholder participation; and (iv) revised accounting, planning, and asset \nmanagement  procedures  based  on  a  computerized  management  information  and  project \nmanagement system (MIPMS) to increase the operational efficiency of PWD.   \n \n1.  Infrastructure Improvement Component  \n \n30.  The  Investment  Program  outputs  will  be  derived  from  the  two  main  physical  and \nnonphysical  components\u2014infrastructure  improvement  and  infrastructure  management.  The \ninfrastructure improvement component of each project will include five elements (i) consulting \nservices  for  preparation  of  detailed  project  reports;  (ii)  physical  improvements  (repair, \nrehabilitation, reconstruction) to selected roads to elevate them to a good condition with higher \n                                                 \n14  Includes  improvements  to  transverse  and  cross-sectional  drainage;  minor  widening;  paving,  repaving,  or \nreconstruction of pavements; and stabilization of slopes. \n ", "8 \ncapacity and safety standards; (iii) maintenance of improved roads according to predetermined \nperformance  standards;  (iv)  supervision  of  physical  improvements  and  administration  of \nmaintenance contracts; and (v) consulting services for increasing the capacity of the program \nmanagement unit (PMU) and project implementation units (PIU) to administer contracts and \nensure compliance with safeguards. The roads to be improved under each project have been \nselected and prioritized using a multi-criteria ranking system based on the overall vision of \nUttaranchal, and considering the financial, environmental, social, and technical constraints. The \nlist of prioritized roads to be improved under the first four projects of the Investment Program is \nin Appendix 4. \n \n2.  Infrastructure Management Component  \n \n31.  The main objective of the infrastructure management component is to increase the \nsustainability of the investment by helping PWD restructure and adopt improved policies and \noperational procedures, and increase staff skills (Appendix 3). The infrastructure management \ncomponent in Project 1 will include (i) assistance for the planning unit at PWD headquarters to \nstart developing policies, setting performance targets, and programming to ensure road network \nquality and consistency; (ii) assistance to establish a fully functional road board1 comprising \nrepresentatives  of  PWD's  senior  management,  transport  users,  automobile  associations, \ntransport operators, and road builders; (iii) revisions to operating manuals for planning, design, \nconstruction, and maintenance in line with the vision and mission of PWD; (iv) training in areas \nsuch as design review, performance monitoring, quality assurance, financial management, and \nthe MIPMS to improve the staff\u2019s ability to execute tasks under the revised organizational \nstructure and operational procedures; and (v) workshops to increase the awareness and skills of \nstate  civil  works  contractors  on  preparation  and  bidding  for  PBCs,  quality  control,  overall \nconstruction,  equipment  and  labor  management,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard \ncompliance. \n \nD.  Special Feature \n \n32.  Physical works under the Investment Program would include improvements to road \ninfrastructure and performance-based maintenance. This would be the first time a state agency \nin India has agreed to adopt PBCs in an externally funded program. Moreover, the Executing \nAgency has agreed to its gradual adoption as the default method of works procurement. PBCs \ncan generate substantial savings, and increase opportunities for private sector involvement.  \nThe savings would be derived from economies of scale and lower prices in return for long-term \nwork assurances for contractors. PBCs, which are generally larger and longer than conventional \nconstruction contracts, also help contractors spread the overhead, and provide incentives to \nbuild better roads to lower subsequent maintenance costs. That would encourage in-state \ncontractors to consolidate or expand, and be more professional and innovative. PWD, on the \nother hand, can reduce the number of contracts and variation orders, which create opportunities \nfor misrepresentation of work and ex gratia payments for expeditious processing.   \n  \n \n                                                 \n1  The main objective of the road board is to provide a forum for the PWD to soliciting input from key stakeholders on \nthe performance of the road network.  The terms of reference for the road board as well as its mandate will be \nfinalized with the assistance of the infrastructure management consultants in Project 1.  ", "  9\nE.  Investment Program Cost Estimates  \n \n33.  The Investment Program is estimated to cost the equivalent of about $830.0 million, \nincluding  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loans  from  ADB  during \nconstruction (Table 1).

Investment Program Financing Plan  \n \n34.  India has requested financing of up to the equivalent of $550 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance part of the Investment Program. The financing will be provided \nunder the Facility in accordance with ADB policy.16 The Facility will extend multiple loans of no \nless  than  $50  million  to  finance  part  of  the  costs  of  the  seven  projects  constituting  the \nInvestment Program. These will be subject to submission of related periodic financing requests \n(PFR) by India, and execution of the related loan and project agreements. India has entered into \na framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB, which satisfies the requirements set forth in \nAppendix 4 of the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities (footnote 17). India is required to \ncomply with the FFA requirements. If India requests from ADB any cofinancing or related \nassistance for the projects under the Facility, ADB may assist, subject to compliance with its \nrelated policy and procedures.  \n \n35.   The provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to ADB\u2019s London \nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans17 will apply to each loan, subject to modifications, \nif any, that might be included under any loan agreement. India can choose between the eligible \ncurrencies and the interest rate regimes for each loan.

Project 1 Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n37.  Project 1 is estimated to cost the equivalent of about $74.0 million, including taxes, \nduties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  (Table  3).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure \ncategory and financier of Project 1 are in Appendix 5. A loan of $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility to cover \npart of the cost of Project 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears. It will have an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms and conditions as agreed \nin the FFA, and supplemented under the Loan Agreement. The financing plan is in Table 4. \n  \nH.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Program and Project Management  \n \n38.  As the Executing Agency, PWD of Uttaranchal has established a PMU for Project 1 to \nserve as its representative. That PMU will remain adequately staffed and functional for the \nduration of the Investment Program, and will be responsible for day-to-day operation of each \nsubsequent  project  and  the  Investment  Program.  The  PMU  also  will  undertake  periodic \nfunctions, such as (i) preparation of PFRs; (ii) announcement of projects; (iii) engagement of \nconsultants and contractors; (iv) preparation of reports; (v) obtainment of approvals from ADB \nand government agencies; and (vi) supervision of consultants. \n \n39.  The PMU staff will comprise a project director and at least one planning and design \nengineer; procurement specialist; project finance manager; and an environment specialist and \nsocial  and  resettlement  specialist  to  help  implement  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement \nframework  (RF),  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  (IPDF),  and  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF). The project director will report to the chief engineer \nwho, as the head of PWD, would be responsible for approving submissions to ADB through the \nsecretary  of  PWD.  The  secretary  of  PWD  would  be  responsible  for  interdepartmental \ncoordination, as well as overall supervision of the Investment Programs and individual projects.

PWD will establish an adequate number of PIUs for each Project. Six PIUs have been \ndesignated for Project 1. Each PIU for a project will be headed by a superintending engineer, \nassisted by an executive engineer and at least two other technical staff, an accounts officer, and \ntwo  administrative  staff.  The  PMU  will  engage  independent  consultants,  financed  by \nUttaranchal, for monitoring social and environmental safeguard implementation. The head of \neach PIU will liaise with the project director of the PMU on matters of implementation of the \nrelated project, and will be responsible for providing the information and data necessary for \nrecording and reporting purposes.  \n \n41.  The steering committee set up by Uttaranchal to monitor and guide the preparation of \nthe  Investment  Program  will  remain  properly  constituted  and  functional  during  the \nimplementation of the Investment Program. It will help the PMU to ensure effective and timely \nimplementation of the Investment Program and projects. The chief secretary of Uttaranchal will \nchair the steering committee, which will comprise the secretary of PWD, and secretaries of key \nstate agencies.  The secretary of PWD will call meetings every quarter or earlier, if necessary.  \n \n42.  PWD will establish a road board chaired by the secretary of PWD, and comprising at \nleast one representative from (i) passenger and freight transport providers\u2019 associations; (ii) \n ", "12  \n \nstate traffic police; (iii) state medical department; and (iv) any other agency that can provide \ninput to increase the impact of the Investment Program and projects. The road board chair will \nconvene bi-annual  meetings, and minutes of the meetings and any actions taken will be made \npublic.  The salient aspects of the discussions and the main actions taken will be summarized in \nthe quarterly project and Investment Program reports to ADB.    \n \n2.  Project Preparation and Appraisal \n \n43.  For Project 1, pre-construction activities, including those related to environmental and \nsocial safeguards, have been completed. Resettlement activities are expected to be completed \nbefore the commencement of works. For subsequent projects, PWD, with the assistance of the \nprogram support consultants, will prepare a detailed project report, including environmental, \nsocial, and economic assessments; and a PFR for each project. Further, each project will be \nprepared in accordance with the FFA, RF, IPDF, and EARF agreed with ADB; and criteria and \nprocedures outlined in Appendix 4. After appraising each project for technical and economic \nfeasibility,  and  compliance  with  safeguards  and  requirements,  PWD  will  submit  to  ADB  a \nsummary  appraisal  report  prepared  in  the  format  specified  in  the  Investment  Program \nadministration memorandum, and the draft PFR. ADB will perform a due diligence analysis in \naccordance with the relevant policies and frameworks, and approve PWD\u2019s appraisal, subject to \nany amendments and revisions. If required by ADB, PWD will revise and amend the PFR, which \nit will submit through India to ADB for approval on or before the PFR due date in the FFA.   \n \n44.  PWD  simultaneously  will  carry  out  advance  contracting,  such  as  recruitment  of \nconsultants and selection of contractors as approved by ADB, to ensure timely implementation \nof each project.   \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule  \n \n45.  The  seven  projects  of  the  Investment  Program  and  their  subcomponents  will  be \nimplemented over 10 years, as shown in the indicative implementation schedule in Appendix 6. \nThe detailed schedules for the first four projects have been finalized, and the schedules for the \nremaining three projects will be completed during the implementation of Project 3. PWD will \nprepare detailed implementation schedules those projects during the pre-construction of the \nprevious project.  \n \n46.  Project 1 is expected to be implemented over 4.5 years, beginning April 2007. This \nschedule includes 1.5 years for the physical improvements and 3 years of performance-based \nmaintenance. The infrastructure management component in Project 1 will be implemented over \n2 years, commencing upon the effectiveness of the first loan.  \n  \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n47.  Design and Supervision of Works. PWD will engage one or more private firms of \nengineering consultants for design and construction supervision of each project, except for \nProjects 1 and 2.18 For these two projects, consulting firms will be engaged only for supervision. \nThe number of construction supervision consulting service packages needed for each project \nwill be determined based on the scope and geographic spread of the works packages. For \nProject 1, three packages will be used to procure the 1,000 person-months of input needed.  \n                                                 \n18  PWD has financed the design part of Projects 1 and 2 to increase project readiness. ", "  13\nThe  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  supervision  consultants  for  Project  1  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix 3.  \n \n48.  Program Support. PWD will engage experienced national consultants, financed under \nProject 1, to provide 92 person-months of inputs to help the PMU coordinate and facilitate timely \nprocessing and implementation of the Investment Program activities. The scope of services \nwould  include  assistance  to  the  PMU  to  (i)  update  the  RDP;  (ii)  prepare  the  supporting \ndocumentation required for the future PFRs and PBCs; (iii) carry out technical reviews of the \nsubproject designs, including safeguard compliance; and (iv) prepare reports for submission to \nADB. Outline terms of reference for this consulting service are in Supplementary Appendix 4. \nAdditional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured in subsequent projects to ensure \ntimely implementation. \n \n49.  Infrastructure Management. PWD will engage an international consulting firm working \nwith  national  experts  to  provide  98  person-months  of  assistance  (14  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 84 person-months of national consulting services) to the \nPMU to implement the infrastructure management component in Project 1. Outline terms of \nreference for these consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix 5. Additional consulting \nservices, if necessary, will be procured in subsequent projects. \n \n50.  All consultants financed from the Facility would be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \n5.  Procurement  \n \n51.  Works  to  be  financed  from  the  Facility  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  procedures  and  post-qualification  method,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  as  described  in  the \nprocurement plan for the Investment Program in Appendix 7. The bidding documents and \nprocurement procedures agreed between PWD and ADB for use under advance contracting, as \nalso set out in the procurement plan, will be followed for NCB. Any modifications to these will be \nagreed between PWD and ADB, and further set out in the procurement plan. The upper limit for \na works contract to be procured through NCB procedures initially will be set at $10.0 million, \nand will be reviewed during implementation.  \n \n52.  The  standard  review  and  approval  procedure  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and the procurement plan (Appendix 7) will be used for procurement in Projects 1 \nand 2 of the Investment Program. PWD will submit the documentation, as specified in the \nguidelines,  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  before  signing  the  works  contracts.  Indicative \ncontract packages for Project 1 are described in Appendix 7.  \n \n53.  If PWD is deemed to have adhered closely to the procurement plan and guidelines in \nProjects 1 and 2, ADB may allow subsequent NCB contract packages to be awarded without \nprior review to reduce procurement time. This would increase ownership of the process within \nPWD, as well as promote transparency, accountability, and good governance practices. This \napproval procedure requires that PWD (i) retains records of all procurement documentation, \nincluding  copies  of  the  signed  contracts  and  the  bid  evaluation  reports  for  inspection;  (ii) \nprovides ADB with a certified summary sheet describing the main aspects of the bid evaluation \nand contract award at the time of each contract award; (iii) engages an independent private firm \nto perform periodic audits of the procurement processes and contract awards; (iv) engages an \n ", "14  \n \nindependent  private  firm  of  chartered  accountants  to  audit  the  PMU  annually;  and  (v) \nacknowledges that, if any contract award is found to be unacceptable, ADB may refuse to \nfinance the contract. ADB will select contracts at random for review to ensure that all due \nprocesses have been followed.  \n \n54.  Works in any project may be procured under PBCs or traditional works contracts if only \nimprovement works are procured. ADB has reviewed the documents to be used for combined \nimprovement and maintenance works procurement, which are based on ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments for small works and other national and international guidelines, and found them to \nbe generally acceptable.  \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n \n55.  ADB management has approved advance contracting for components to be financed \nfrom the Facility.  Up to 20% of the proceeds of a loan will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works and consulting services of a project eligible for \nfinancing from the Facility, in accordance with agreed procedures and during the 12 months \nbefore the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement.  This approval, however, \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project(s) from the Facility. \n \n7.   Anticorruption Measures \n \n56.  ADB  has  assessed  thoroughly  the  accounting  and  financial  management  policies, \nregulations, and practices of PWD (Supplementary Appendix 9); and agreed on measures to \nimprove governance, accountability, and transparency. These measures include (i) independent \nexternal audits of contracts and accounts; (ii) the stakeholder road board; (iii) Web-based bid \ndisclosures; and (iv) project performance tracking Web-based systems (i.e., MIPMS). ADB has \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  Uttaranchal  and  PWD  the  Anticorruption  Policies  and \nStrategies (1998), as amended from time to time; and its right to investigate, directly or through \nits  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nprojects under the Facility. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policies and Strategies \n(1998) and oversight measures are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents \nfor the projects financed from the Facility. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB from the \nFacility will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of PWD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the projects under the Facility.  \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n57.  The  last  disbursements  under  any  tranche  from  the  Facility  must  be  made  by  31 \nDecember 2017. The last PFR is expected to be submitted no later than 1 May 2012, provided \nthat the availability period will lapse 12 months from the date of approval of the Facility by ADB\u2019s \nBoard, unless by such time the legal agreements for the first tranche under the Facility are \nsigned and made effective. For consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works \ncontracts, loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement \nprocedures.  The  PMU  may  use  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  under  the \nreimbursement procedure for individual payments not exceeding $100,000, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to time.    \n ", "  15\n58.  The PMU will maintain separate bank accounts for each project. The funds drawn down \nin accordance with each PFR, with the corresponding counterpart funds, will be credited to the \ncorresponding account. Each PIU for a project will submit contractor payment certificates to the \nPMU, which will arrange for the necessary bank transfers to be made into the contractors\u2019 \nnominated account(s). PWD will be responsible for monitoring the project bank accounts, and \nfor reviewing monthly reconciliation of the accounts made by the PMU. PWD also will approve \nwithdrawal applications.  \n \n   9.  Midterm Reviews  \n \n59.  ADB, India, and Uttaranchal will undertake a midterm review of the Investment Program \nin June 2012.  A midterm review of Project 1 will be undertaken in January 2010.  The timing of \nmidterm reviews of subsequent projects will be agreed upon during the approval of each project.  \nThe reviews will focus on impacts, particularly those relating to institutional, administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects,  and  poverty  reduction.    The \nprojects\u2019 economic viability, and other relevant aspects that might impact performance, also will \nbe assessed during the reviews.  In addition, the reviews will examine the implementation \nprogress for the sector reforms, policy development, performance of the road sector as a whole, \nand compliance with assurances in the FFA.  \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n60.  Uttaranchal has agreed to adhere strictly to accounting, financial management, and \ncorporate governance requirements during implementation of the Investment Program. PWD \nwill assign to the PMU a professionally qualified finance manager, as well as an administrative \nassistant trained on the new computer-based system. The PMU will maintain separate records \nand accounts adequate to identify (i) the goods and services financed from the proceeds of \neach  loan;  (ii)  the  financing  resources  received;  (iii)  the  expenditures  incurred  on  the \ncomponents of each project; and (iv) use of local funds. PWD will engage independent external \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  consolidated  project  accounts  annually,  and  provide \nopinions on the accounts and statement of expenditure operations. The state auditor general\u2019s \noffice, which also maintains the accounts, will conduct its routine annual audits of PWD, as well \nas the projects and the Investment Program. The independent financial audits will enable PWD \nto submit its audited financial statements and audited project accounts to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n61.   ADB\u2019s Board will be briefed annually on the progress through the review missions\u2019 back-\nto-office reports, and after the review of the PFRs.  \n \n11.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n62.  With the assistance from the construction supervision consultants of Project 1, PWD will \ndevelop an investment program performance monitoring system and a project performance \nmonitoring system to monitor and evaluate the impacts, outcomes, outputs, and activities in \nrelation to the targets and milestones set for each project and the Investment Program.    \n \n63.  At the beginning of each project, PWD and ADB will agree on a set of baseline values of \neconomic, social, environmental, and poverty reduction impact indicators. With the assistance \nof  the  construction  supervision  engineer(s)  of  that  project,  PWD  will  conduct  participatory \nsurveys, and collect and analyze data at intervals agreed with ADB. Comments and findings of \n ", "16  \n \nthe data analyses will be submitted as part of every other quarterly report of PWD to ADB. A \ncomplete analysis of related primary and secondary data on impacts and outcomes will be \nperformed at completion, and 3 years after completion of each project and the Investment \nProgram. The results, which will be reported to ADB within 3 months, will highlight the positive \nand negative impacts and outcomes of each project and the Investment Program. \n \n12.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation  \n \n64.  PWD will ensure that the Investment Program is implemented with active participation of \nall  stakeholders,  using  participatory  practices.  As  part  of  the  preparation  of  Project  1, \nconsultations  were  held  with  stakeholders,  including  directly  affected  people,  and  local \nadministrative departments. Issues related to the implementation of Project 1 and activities \ninvolved in the implementation were discussed. Stakeholder consultation and participation will \ncontinue throughout implementation. The initial poverty and social assessment report, and the \nshort resettlement plans (RP) for Project 1 have been made available to the public by PWD and \nare posted on the ADB Web site. For subsequent projects, PWD will ensure that completed \nRPs, IPDPs, and resettlement monitoring reports are made available to affected people and are \nsubmitted to ADB for posting on its Web site. Additionally, the meetings of the road board would \nserve as a forum for stakeholders to discuss and seek resolutions to significant issues. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n65.  The main immediate benefits of the Investment Program include savings in vehicle \noperating costs, travel time, and maintenance costs stemming from the physical improvements.  \nHowever, a large part of the road network lies in rolling terrain at high altitudes, which makes \nthe cost of construction and maintenance generally higher than in plain areas. As such, the net \nbenefits in the initial years are expected to be low. Moreover, much of the network has been \ndesigned to connect low-income hamlets, which generate few daily trips. While improvements to \nthe roads in those areas would increase the people\u2019s level of accessibility to basic services and \nmarkets, the number of additional trips at the outset would be small. Consequently, travel time \nand vehicle operating cost savings in the initial years are expected to be small. However, as the \nInvestment Program advances and more parts of the network\u2014including links to the national \nhighway system\u2014are improved, the generation of passenger and freight trips is expected to \nincrease substantially. Moreover, indirect benefits expected from the nonphysical parts of the \nInvestment Program would increase and become substantial after about the third year. These \nbenefits would include (i) increased local contractor capacity; (ii) systematic road investment \nplanning and programming; (iii) improved financial management and governance; (iv) reduced \naccidents; and (v) walking time savings for bus passengers, which currently are not reasonably \nquantifiable. \n \nA.  Economic Benefits  \n \n66.  The economic analysis of the subnetwork of roads in Project 1 has been performed \nbased  on  the  expected  benefits  from  the  physical  improvement  and  performance-based \nmaintenance of 23 roads totaling 570 km (about 3% of the network). The benefits considered \nare  (i)  operating  cost  savings  for  normal  passenger  and  freight  traffic  resulting  from  the \nimprovements to riding quality; (ii) travel time savings for normal passengers and shippers \nresulting from the improvements in riding quality; (iii) travel time savings for passengers and \nfreight resulting from fewer temporary road closures; (iv) savings in routine and periodic road ", "  17\nmaintenance costs due to PBCs for maintenance; and (v) savings to generated19 and induced \ntraffic.   \n \n67.  Due to the low trip generation rates and the opportunity cost of time, as well as the \nvehicle composition in the project area, the total (discounted) benefits20 are expected to be $48 \nmillion. The distributive analysis of Project 1 benefits has shown that (i) about 32% of the \nvehicle operating cost savings would accrue to car and light commercial vehicle operators that \nprovide the bulk of the informal passenger services in the hill areas; (ii) about 32% to freight \noperators; and (iii) about 14% to formal bus operators. Of the travel time savings, nearly 62% \nwould accrue to passengers21 and the rest to shippers (freight). The poverty impact ratio of \nProject 1 is 0.30.  \n \n68.  Despite the relatively small benefits and the high cost of physical works due to terrain \nconditions, the economic rate of return (EIRR) of Project 1 is 16.3%. The net present value \n(NPV) at a 12% discount rate is $14.4 million equivalent. Sensitivity testing has demonstrated \nthat Project 1 remains viable, with EIRR values above the normally accepted viability threshold \nof 12%, if costs increase by 20% or benefits decrease by 20%. In a worst case test, when costs \nincrease by 20% and benefits decrease by 20%, the EIRR drops to 11.2%. A summary of the \nsensitivity tests carried out is in Table 6.  \n \n69.  A probabilistic risk analysis also has been carried out to assess the combined effects of \nkey input parameters, including costs, benefits, and traffic growth, on the EIRR and NPV. This \nrisk analysis has provided a more realistic indication of the robustness of the overall EIRR than \nthe conventional sensitivity tests reported in paragraph 68. It found only a 3% probability that \nthe EIRR will be below 12%, and a 95% probability that the EIRR would be greater than 20%. \nFurther details of these analyses are in Supplementary Appendix 6. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Economic Appraisal Sensitivity Tests \n     \nSensitivity Test  EIRR  NPV \n  (%)  (Rs Million) \nBase case  16.3  647.9 \n     \nBenefits reduced by 20%  13.5  211.7 \nInitial construction costs increased by 20%   13.7  297.4 \nBenefits reduced by 20% and initial construction costs increased by 20%  11.2  (138.7) \n     \nTraffic growth reduced by 20%  14.9  408.2 \nTraffic growth reduced by 50%  12.8  104.7 \n     \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Sustainability of Physical Investments  \n \n70.  Despite  the  absence  of  state-road  network  components  with  sufficient  potential  to \ngenerate toll or other revenues, Uttaranchal is committed to funding the Investment Program \n                                                 \n19  The generated traffic was estimated by adopting a price elasticity of demand of one (i.e., a 10% decrease in \ntransport costs would give a 10% increase in traffic).  \n20  About 85% of the benefits result from vehicle operating cost savings and 15% from travel time savings. \n21  Assuming that capacity of the light commercial vehicles is shared equally by passengers and freight. \n ", "18  \n \nthrough  additional  budget  allocations  and  external  borrowings,  which  might  come  from \nincreased revenue from the technology and power22 sectors. Uttaranchal is also committed to \nproviding adequate funds to maintain the roads after the improvements, which would require a \n5%\u201310% increase in the current funding level23 (when adjusted for inflation). Part of these funds \nare expected to come from vehicle taxes and licensing fees, which have been growing at more \nthan 15% annually since 2003. Moreover, the additional funding needed likely would decline \nover time with the anticipated reduction of about 10%\u201320% in maintenance costs due to PBCs \nand increased use of multi-axel trucks.24 That would permit the savings to be used for activities \nto increase mobility and accessibility for the rural people.  \n \nC.  Sustainability of Nonphysical Investments  \n \n71.  The  infrastructure  management  components  would  help  PWD  to  maintain  the \nmomentum of the RDP and the infrastructure improvement components at a level needed to \nachieve the national and state development goals. The mix of interventions planned under the \ninfrastructure management component in Project 1, which range from staff training to functional \nreorganizations to involvement of road users in planning, will transform the business process of \nPWD. The training program, in particular, is expected to increase staff productivity and asset \nperformance by providing the skills necessary for efficient execution of the work programs using \ninformation technology and higher quality control systems. Training and awareness programs \ndesigned to increase civil works contractors\u2019 capacity would improve work quality, increasing \nthe life of assets. Integrity and transparency of the processes will be enhanced by the use of \ninformation technology, which will be supported by staff training on MIMPS. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts  \n \n72.  The Investment Program is categorized as A, because parts of two roads in Project 1 \nare  within  environmentally  sensitive  or  protected  areas.  Field  observations  during  the \npreparatory  stage  also  indicated  that  most  roads  in  their  current  condition  damage  the \nenvironment through surface runoff, earth slips, dust, erosion, noise, and air pollution. The \nproposed improvements under the Investment Program will reduce several of the sources of \nsuch  pollutants,  particularly  runoff,  earth  slips,  and  dust.  The  initial  environmental  impact \nexamination  (IEE)  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  have  shown  that  some \ntemporary and reversible negative environmental impacts are likely during construction. These \ninclude (i) temporary reduction in water quality in nearby streams; (ii) temporary increases in \nparticulate emissions and noise levels near settlements; and (iii) minor impacts on flora and \nfauna, especially in sections in forests and protected areas. These impacts will be mitigated by \nfully  implementing  the  protective  measures  and  closely  monitoring  construction  works, \naccording to the environmental management plans (EMP). \n \n73.  The two roads (from Almora to Bageshwar, and Barechina to Sheraghat) in Project 1, \nparts of which pass through Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, have been operational for more than 40 \nyears. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a protected area, and ownership of the roads was \ntransferred from PWD to the Forest Department in 1988. The roads, which are about 25 km \nfrom the main wildlife habitats, connect several communities to the national highway system and \nprovide access to potential tourist destinations. The improvements proposed for these two \nroads will be limited to the pavement and drainage facilities within the existing rights-of-way. \n                                                 \n22  Power generation increased 14% between 2005 and 2006. \n23  About 2.3% of the total annual state capital disbursement. \n24  Resulting from tax incentives offered by the state government. ", "  19\nTherefore,  the  short-term,  construction-related  negative  impacts  will  be  few.  The  EMPs  to \naddress those short-term impacts have been prepared based on the EIA studies of the two \nroads. The Ministry of Environment and Forest of India will review and approve the EIA reports \nbefore the award of works contracts. An IEE report encompassing the rest of the roads in \nProject 1 also has been prepared. The summary EIA report for Project 1 and EARF were \nsubmitted to the Board and disclosed to public through ADB\u2019s Web site on 17 July 2006. \n \n74.  In each subsequent project of the Investment Program, PWD will try to contain the \nimprovements within the existing rights-of-way, and conduct environmental assessments of \neach road to be improved in that project. An EIA, including an EMP, will be prepared for each \nroad categorized as A according to ADB guidelines; and a summary EIA will be prepared and \nsubmitted to ADB for review. To avoid short-term impacts of the road improvement works on \nwildlife  sanctuaries  and  forested  areas,  asphalt  mixing  plants,  crusher  plants,  construction \ncamps, and disposal of construction material will not be permitted within such areas. The \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  work  closely  with  the  Sanctuary  Wardens  and  Forest \nConservators of the relevant areas. PWD will be responsible for implementing the EMPs, while \nthe  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  during \nconstruction.  \n \n75.  For  roads  categorized  other  than  A,  PWD  will  prepare  an  IEE  report  and  a \ncorresponding EMP. The environmental assessments required for environmental categorization, \nreview and approval procedures, as well as the responsibilities of ADB and PWD, are described \nin EARF. For village roads and light vehicle roads, an IEE checklist and a standard EMP will be \nemployed.25 To comply with national requirements, PWD will obtain the necessary permits from \nthe relevant agencies before handing over the construction sites. All environmental reports and \nEMPs will be prepared according to the relevant national and state laws and regulations, as well \nas ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EARF. \n \nE.  Social and Poverty Impacts  \n \n76.  The Planning Commission of Uttaranchal has estimated that more than 35% of the \npeople in the state live in poverty. The population in the Investment Program catchment areas \nconsists largely of rural people (75%), who are mostly farmers and unskilled laborers. A social \nassessment along the roads to be improved in Project 1 found that 4%\u201311% of the households \nare involved in businesses, while 19%\u201335% of the households are engaged in agriculture. Each \nday, women on average spend 4 hours on household activities and 5 hours on agricultural \nactivities. An average person travels 3\u20136 km to access health facilities. In most of the districts, \nthe surveys found that people walk 6\u20137 km to the nearest bus stop or local transport services. \nLocal transport is infrequent\u2014in most cases, SRTC services are provided only once per day. \nHence, people resort to other forms of local transport services. In cases of emergency, people \ndepend on private transport services for which they pay higher charges. The roads to be \nimproved  under  the  Investment  Program  are  spread  across  all  13  districts,  and  will  be \naccessible to about 3.5 million people living in adjacent villages. The improved roads are \nexpected to increase service frequencies and enable more through services to a wider set of \ndestinations. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n                                                 \n25  The IEE checklist and standard EMP served as the IEE for the rural road projects under the components of \nPMSGY funded by ADB.  \n ", "20  \n \nF.  Investment Program Beneficiaries  \n \n77.  In addition to the benefits to the rural people from increased access to markets and \nsocial  services,  the  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  create  business  and  employment \nopportunities in the state. Approximately 80 contract packages, each valued between $8 million \nand $10 million, will be awarded for physical works over 7 years. The larger contracts would \ncreate opportunities for existing contractors to expand and invest in new construction equipment, \nand new contractors to enter the market. Expansion of the construction industry would create \ndirect, permanent employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. Project 1 will require \nabout 0.8 million person-days of input from unskilled workers, and the Investment Program will \nrequire about 15.2 million person-days of input.  \n \nG.  Impact on Indigenous Peoples  \n \n78.  The  Investment  Program  will  not  hinder  or  negatively  impact  any  segment  of  the \npopulation based on ethnic origin. It will generate equal benefits to all persons in the influence \narea of the Investment Program and the region. The improvement to the roads and connectivity \nwill encourage better transport services, thereby improving access for all people, to social \nservices, higher levels of schooling, health facilities, etc.  \n \n79.  No scheduled tribe households will be adversely affected by Project 1. The Indigenous \nPeople Development Framework (IPDF) in Supplementary Appendix 7 was prepared in case \nindigenous people issues arise in the subsequent projects of the Investment Program. If such \nissues arise in any subsequent project, an IPDP will have to be prepared for each road, in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). This will have to be submitted \nto ADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \nH.  Resettlement Impacts  \n \n80.  Four of the 23 roads that will be improved in Project 1 will have resettlement impacts. A \ndetailed census has been conducted along those four roads, and short resettlement plans have \nbeen prepared for each section. No private land acquisition will be required. However, the \nstructures of 17 encroacher and squatter households (totaling 87 affected persons) will be \npartially damaged, including boundary walls and parts of buildings. Six of those 17 structures \nare residential, commercial, or residential-cum-commercial. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy On \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the  resettlement  framework,  if  future  projects  of  the \nInvestment Program entail land acquisition and resettlement impacts, a resettlement plan for \neach  impacting  road  will  have  to  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before \ncontracts are awarded. PWD has disclosed the short resettlement plans for the four impacting \nroads in Project 1 to the affected persons. A summary of the short resettlement plans is in \nAppendix 10.  \n \nI.  Risks  \n \n81.  The main risk to success of the Investment Program is likely to stem from project \npreparation  delays,  implementation  delays,  and  the  quality  of  physical  outputs.  Project \npreparation delays might lead to delays in the submission of PFRs, and subsequent delays in \nthe Investment Program implementation. To minimize this risk, ADB has reviewed all steps in \nproject  preparation  in  detail  with  PWD,  and  has  agreed  on  a  feasible  schedule  for  PFR \nsubmissions. Another potential cause of procurement delays will be mitigated in the Investment ", "  21\nProgram by appropriately grouping and spacing the calls for bids. The projects also have been \nsized and sequenced to allow PWD\u2019s capacity to be enhanced incrementally.  \n \n82.  Evidence  from  recent  road  development  programs  in  India,  particularly  NHDP  and \nPMGSY, suggest that implementation delays in many cases are related to (i) land acquisition; \n(ii)  cumbersome  environmental,  forest,  and  railway  clearance  procedures;  (iii)  procurement \ndocument  preparation;  (iv)  inadequate  procurement  planning;  and  (v)  complexities  of  bid \nevaluation. Poor quality of physical outputs has been found to be a function of executing \nagencies\u2019 lack of experience with contract administration and contracting. To minimize these \nrisks in the Investment Program, PWD\u2019s consultants and later its trained staff will prepare \nadvance plans for each project, identifying the critical paths and necessary advance contracting. \nAdequate  resources  are  provided  for  consulting  services  for  supervision  of  works,  and \nresources are allocated from the infrastructure management component in Project 1 for training \nPWD\u2019s staff in contract administration. Additionally, the PBCs are expected to expand the \ncontractor  pool  due  to  the  increased  size  of  the  contract  packages  and  the  potential  for \nextended work.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n83.  ADB will seek the following broad assurances, in addition to the assurances consistent \nwith its policies applicable to all projects and all borrowers, which will be incorporated in the \nlegal documents: \n \nA.  General \n \n84.  Uttaranchal will \n \n(i)  provide its share of funding for the Investment Program in accordance with the \nFinancing Plan and the implementation schedule, as well as provide for any cost \noverruns in excess of the contingencies; and   \n(ii)  provide the funding needed for maintaining the network roads in a good condition \nduring and after the completion of the Investment Program. \n \nB.  Environment  \n \n85.  Uttaranchal through PWD will \n \n(i)  implement EARF in every project in the Investment Program in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and applicable laws and regulations of India \nand Uttaranchal; and   \n(ii)  provide  training  for  engineers  to  be  assigned  to  projects  for  environmental \nmanagement, and to ensure that PWD\u2019s responsibilities as described in EARF \nare  fully  implemented  in  consultation  with  the  contractor  and  construction \nsupervision consultants.  \n \n ", "22  \n \nC.

Social Impacts and Other Issues \n \n87.  Uttaranchal through PWD will \n \n(i)  implement all projects in the Investment Program in accordance with the RF and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Indigenous  Peoples \nPolicy (1998), and applicable national and state laws and regulations;  \n(ii)  if there are any design changes in Project 1 roads, ensure that the short RPs are \nupdated on the basis of the final alignment and submitted to ADB for review and \napproval prior to awarding of civil works contracts. \n  \nE.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n \n88.  PWD will ensure that the works contractors under the project(s) incorporate provisions to \nthe effect that the contractor will (i) carry out HIV/AIDs awareness and prevention programs for \nlabor; (ii) not employ or use children as labor; (iii) disseminate information at worksites on risks \nof sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDs as part of health and safety measures for those \nemployed during construction; and (iv) follow and implement all statutory provisions on labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe civil works contract will also provide for termination of the contract by PWD in case of \nbreach of any of the stated provisions by the contractors. \n \nF.  Road Safety \n \n89.  Uttaranchal will ensure strict adherence of contractors to national and state road safety \nstandards in terms of signage, road markings, roadside structures, and maintenance. As part of \nthe midterm review of the Investment Program, Uttaranchal and ADB will conduct a road safety \naudit and, if necessary, implement any measures needed to revise the institutional mechanisms, \nfinancing modalities, and detailed implementing arrangements to improve safety. \n ", "  23\nG.  Selection and Approval Process for Project Roads  \n \n90.  PWD will ensure that selection of roads to be improved in each project of the Investment \nProgram  is  based  on  the  procedures  and  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  4,  and  will  be  in \naccordance with the RDP. The request for approval of each project will follow the stages \ndescribed in Appendix 4 and the FFA. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n91.  Uttaranchal through PWD will   \n \n(i)  ensure that the steering committee set up to monitor and guide the Investment \nProgram will remain for the entire duration of the Facility, and will oversee the \nimplementation of all projects to ensure timely and successful completion; \n(ii)  ensure that the PMU set up for Project 1 shall remain adequately staffed and \nfunctional during the implementation of subsequent projects in the Investment \nProgram and provide, as necessary, counterpart staff;   \n(iii)  within  2  months  of  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan,  engage  program  support \nconsultants  financed  by  the  first  loan,  to  assist  the  PMU  to  coordinate  and \nfacilitate processing and implementation of the Investment Program activities, \nand liaise with the consultants in different projects;   \n(iv)  at least 1 month prior to the award of the first works contract under each project \nor no more than 1 month from the date of effectiveness of the loan for each \nproject,  whichever  comes  first,  establish  an  adequate  number  of  PIUs  to \nadminister the works contracts in each project; \n(v)  ensure that the composition of the Steering Committee and the PMU staff agreed \nwith ADB remains fixed for the entire duration of the Investment Program, and \nthe composition of the staff of the PIU(s) set up for a particular project will remain \nfixed for the entire duration of that project; \n(vi)  ensure that necessary authority is delegated to the appropriate PMU staff for \ntimely  processing  of  PFRs  and  implementation  of  individual  projects  to \ncoordinate with ADB for strict adherence to implementation schedules including, \nbut not limited to, recruitment of consultants and safeguard compliances, as \nagreed under the Facility as well as for individual projects; and \n(vii)  provide adequate funding for independent monitoring of safeguard activities in \nthe projects under the various frameworks. \n \nI.  Performance Monitoring and Reporting \n \n92.  Uttaranchal will  \n \n(i)  ensure that PWD, in consultation with ADB, develops within 3 months of the \napproval of the Facility an investment program performance monitoring system.  \nSimilarly within 3 months of the effective date of each Loan Agreement, PWD will \ndevelop  a  project  performance  monitoring  system.  The  investment  program \nperformance monitoring system and project performance monitoring system will \nmonitor and evaluate the impacts, outcomes, outputs and activities in relation to \nthe targets and milestones set for the overall Investment Program and the project \nrespectively; \n \n ", "24  \n \n(ii)  ensure that PWD prepares reports in the format provided in the PAM of each \nproject and the facility administration memorandum and submits to ADB at the \nagreed frequency for each type of report. \n \n93.  India will submit a project completion report to ADB for each project within 3 months of \nphysical completion for the project, and a Facility completion report within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the Investment Program.  \n \nJ.  Reviews \n \n94.  ADB,  India,  and  Uttaranchal  will  meet  periodically  to  discuss  the  progress  of  the \nproject(s) and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures required to \nbe undertaken ensure the impacts and outcomes of the project(s) and Investment Program.  \n \n95.  Midterm reviews of Project 1 and the Investment Program will be undertaken by ADB, \nIndia, and Uttaranchal in January 2010 and June 2012 respectively.  The reviews will focus on \nissues related to implementation arrangements, and the reviewers would agree on changes, if \nneeded, to achieve the objectives of Project 1 or the Investment Program. Timing for the \nmidterm review of each subsequent project will be agreed upon at the time of approval of that \nproject. \n \nK.  Audits \n \n96.  PWD  will  ensure  that  contracts  financed  from  the  Facility  will  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of PWD and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project(s) \nunder the Facility.  \n \n97.  Uttaranchal through PWD will \n \n(i)  ensure that proper accounts and records are maintained and audited in a timely \nmanner to adequately identify the use of loan proceeds in such manner and \ndetail  as  may  be  specified  under  each  Loan  Agreement  and  Project \nAgreement(s); \n(ii)  in consultation with ADB, engage an independent external  audit firm to conduct \nannual  audits  of  consolidated  accounts  of  each  Project  prior  to  the  audit \nperformed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India; and \n(iii)  submit the annual financial statements and audited accounts for each Project to \nADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year of Uttaranchal.   \n \nL.

Performance and Constraints \n1.  Introduction \n1.  The roads subsector in the state of Uttaranchal comprises road infrastructure, which is \nadministered  by  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD);  and  transport  services,  which  are \noverseen by the Transport Department. Both departments have a state cabinet minister. PWD is \nresponsible  for  planning,  financing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  roads,  bridges,  and \ngovernment  buildings.  Uttaranchal\u2019s  Transport  Department  is  the  remit  of  Uttar  Pradesh\u2019s \nTransport Department, which was constituted in 1945 under the provisions of Section 133 A of \nthe Motor Vehicles' Act 1939, and is headed by a commissioner. Transport Department is \nresponsible for issuing licenses for vehicles and operators, operating permits for private freight \nand passenger service operators, and managing the State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC). \n2.  Transport Services \n2.  Approximately 90% of passenger and freight traffic in the state moves by road. Further, \nmore than 80% of the freight and passenger traffic and heavy vehicles use national highways, \nwhich account for less than 7% of the road network.1 Rail services offer freight and passenger \nconnections to the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh and to New Delhi through four rail heads \nin Uttaranchal\u2019s southern low-lying plain region.2 The hilly and mountainous terrain that covers \nmore than 90% of state\u2019s land area would preclude the development of railway infrastructure \ncatering to intrastate services. Although an air service operates once a day between the state \ncapital Dehradun and New Delhi, its capacity is limited and its reliability is poor.   \n \n3.  SRTC  operates  inter-  and  intrastate  passenger  services  on  35  nationalized  routes \n(mostly national highways, state highways, and district roads), and on many non-nationalized \n(routes of other classes of roads). However, private operators provide the bulk of the freight and \npassenger services under permits issued by state transport authorities. These private operators \nare responsive to customer demand, and are not constrained by fixed schedules. The private \npassenger and freight transport operators have formed independent unions and associations to \nsafeguard their interests and lobby the state government for concessions.   \n \n4.  SRTC has a fleet of 968 buses operating out of 15 depots across the state.3 In 2005, \nSRTC\u2019s vehicle utilization averaged 288 kilometers (km) per day at an average occupancy of \n63%. Gross income from operations during the same period was approximately $28.5 million, \nand monthly income increased by 27% during the year. SRTC has embarked on a program to \nreplace the aging bus fleet it inherited from Uttar Pradesh, with the replacement of the full fleet \nplanned by the end of 2007. Although SRTC\u2019s bus operations are well used and show healthy \ngrowth, they focus on connecting the main population centers throughout the state, as well as \nserving Delhi and other important cities in neighboring Uttar Pradesh. \n \n5.  Privately  operated  passenger  transport  predominates  in  the  rural  hill  areas.  These \nservices often serve the smaller villages off the main routes between towns, providing a more \n                                                 \n1  Source: Strategic Options Study. Prepared for the PWD by CES Ltd., New Delhi, May 2005.   \n2  Rail heads are located at the state capital, Dehradun, as well as at Kotdwar, Kathgodam, and Ramnagar. \n3 The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. 2006.

In the hill areas, the private passenger services are provided \nby jeeps that are frequently grossly overloaded with passengers. Operators of these jeeps set \ntheir own fares, within maximum and minimum limits prescribed by SRTC. The state does not \nexercise control over freight tariffs, which are purely market-driven.      \n \n3.  Vehicle Fleet  \n6.  Uttaranchal\u2019s vehicle fleet has been growing steadily over the past 5 years. Since 2001, \nvehicle registration data shows consistent annual growth rates of 12%\u201314%, with the number of \nregistered vehicles reaching 565,700 in March 2005. Of these vehicles, some 77% are two-\nwheelers and 10% are cars. Commercial vehicles (buses, trucks, vans, etc.) account for only \n13% of registered vehicles. Although the high growth rates suggest a buoyant vehicle fleet, \nthese statistics tend to represent conditions in the plains and in the main urban centers where \npopulation densities are higher. They do not reflect the general conditions in the hill areas, \nwhere incomes and population densities are lower. Overall, average vehicle ownership in the \nstate is about 30% lower than the national average. \n   \n4.  Road Network \n7.  The road network administered by PWD comprises of national highways (NH),4 state \nhighways (SH), major district roads (MDR), other district roads (ODR), village roads (VR), light \nvehicle roads (LVR), and footpaths. Approximately 16,800 km of that network are motorable \nroads. The Border Roads Organization manages about 1,200 km of NHs, SHs, MDRs, and \nODRs; while local authorities and other state departments manage approximately 8,100 km of \nlower category roads.   \n \n8.  Only 103 km of roads in the network are two-lane with a carriageway width of 7.0 meters \nor more.5 The rest are single-lane roads with carriageway widths of 3.75 meters or less.6 In \ntotal, 62% of roads are bitumen or concrete surfaced. Table A2.1 shows the proportions of \nsurfaced and un-surfaced roads for the various road categories.   \n \nTable A2.1:  Surface Types of PWD Network in Financial Year 2004 \nNetwork Roads (%) \nRoad Category \nSurfaced   Unsurfaced  \nState Highways  100  0 \nMajor District Roads   99  1 \nOther District Road   66  34 \nVillage Roads   69  31 \nLight Vehicle Roads    10  90 \nTotal PWD Road Network   62  38 \n PWD = Public Works Department.  \n Source: Road Development Plan (November 2005). \n                                                 \n4  NHs fall under the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which has delegated maintenance responsibility to \nPWD. \n5  This excludes the 455 km of NHs with more than two lanes.  \n6  PWD. 2005. Road Network Development Master Plan. Dehradun. (November). ", "Appendix 2  31\n9.  Table A2.2 shows that 28% of the higher class paved roads (SHs7 and MDRs8) are in \npoor condition. More than 80% of the collector and distributor roads (ODRs and VRs9), which \naccount for about 65% of PWD\u2019s network, needs to be repaired or rehabilitated. Consequently, \npoor network connectivity and restrictions on formal transport services to the main arterials \nincrease the cost of transport for people and enterprises. On the roads that are in good and fair \ncondition, geometric deficiencies, lack of signs and delineation, and temporary closures due to \nearth slips and rock falls constrain capacity. Continuation of this phenomenon has deprived a \nlarge part of the population of access to basic services and opportunities to maintain or enhance \nincomes and quality of life during winter and rainy seasons. \n      \nTable A2.2: Surface Condition of PWD Roads by Category in Financial Year 2004 \nCondition Rating (% of length) \nRoad Category \nGood   Fair   Poor   Total \nState Highways   32  46  22  100 \nMajor District Roads   19  75  6  100 \nOther District Road   12  48  40  100 \nVillage Roads   13  45  42  100 \nLight Vehicle Roads    1  23  76  100 \nTotal PWD Road Network   12  45  43  100 \nPWD = Public Works Department. \nSource: PWD\u2019s Road Condition Study 2004\u20132005. \n \n10.  Traffic on SHs, MDRs, and ODRs in the hilly parts of the state reportedly average \naround  500,  300,  and  150  vehicles  per  day,  respectively.  The  Strategic  Options  Study \nconducted by the PWD found that only three roads, totaling 150 km, would warrant widening \nbased on traffic volume. Traffic generation rates in the scarcely populated hilly areas, which are \nserved  by  the  state  roads,  have  remained  low  mostly  due  to  the  poor  surface  condition, \nconstraining  geometry,  and  seasonality  of  the  roads.  Most  of  the  traffic  on  the  state-road \nnetwork is small multipurpose vehicles (jeeps) and non-motorized vehicles.  \n \n11.  A summary of the network and its geographic dispersion is in Table A2.3. The roads are \ndispersed throughout all 13 districts of the state. While the road density per capita is highest in \nthe hilly region, the density per area drops substantially. The majority of those roads are the \nleast maintained and repaired ODRs and VRs, which is the origin of poor connectivity.   \n \n12.  Local contractors carry out periodic maintenance using mostly labor-intensive, outdated, \nand inefficient construction methods. Small local contractors also undertake the capital works. \nThe practice of awarding many small contracts valued at around $1.0 million each provides no \nincentive for those small contractors to invest in modern construction plant, raise production \nrates, and improve quality. In FY2005, 47 contracts were awarded, with the largest being the \nequivalent of  about  $1.2  million  for  the  rehabilitation  of  about  25 km.  Although  PWD  has \nprequalified 65 grade A private contractors to undertake works valued at equivalent of about \n                                                 \n7  The total length of SHs is 696 km. PWD is responsible 437 km, while the Border Roads Organization is responsible \nfor the rest.  \n8  Totaling about 1,370 km. \n9  Totaling about 12,200 km. ", "32  Appendix 2 \n$100,000, only about two in-state contractors reportedly are likely to qualify for works valued at \n$10 million. \n \n13.  Local contractors carry out the majority of routine road maintenance operations, albeit in \nsmall contracts. PWD still has its own labor workforce of about 5,000, which it tends to use in \nthe hilly remote areas. However, a moratorium has been placed on hiring new maintenance \nlabor to reduce the workforce through attrition, which would allow even the routine maintenance \nto be outsourced to the private sector. Under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), \ncontractors carry out road maintenance according to agreed performance standards for 5 years \nafter  completion  of  construction.  Use  of  performance-based  contracts  (PBC)  has  been \nincreasing in India. PWD intends to adopt this method of contracting for area-wide maintenance. \nThis is a positive development that is expected to increase cost efficiency and effectiveness of \nroad maintenance operations. \n \nB.  Planning and Financing  \n14.  Investment in roads is based on annual construction and maintenance budgets prepared \nby the divisional offices of the PWD. The annual budgets include the estimated cost of capital \nworks (new roads and periodic maintenance) and routine maintenance costs. However, works \nare  not  prioritized  and  programmed  according  to  state  or  local  goals.  These  budgets  are \nsubmitted to PWD headquarters for review. Based on those submissions, a budget request is \nmade to the state, which then appropriates the full amount or part of the funds requested to the \nPWD. Those funds then are allocated to the various divisions in proportion to their requests and \nother considerations. \n \n15.  State sources include (i) direct revenue earned through road tax, (ii) license fees, (iii) \nfreight operator\u2019s licenses, and (iv) passenger transport operator\u2019s licenses. The transport tax \nrevenue goes into the state government\u2019s reserves, and is not dedicated for road development. \nThis  revenue  amounted  to  $21.9  million  in  FY2004,  which  was  around  20%  of  the  total \nexpenditure budget for that year. The remainder was from direct budget allocations. In FY2006, \nthe state\u2019s contribution was approximately 83%, with the national sources making up the rest. \nTable A2.410 shows an increasing trend in financing for road infrastructure since FY2002, and a \nlarger portion being allocated to maintenance. Revenues from vehicle taxes and licenses have \nbeen increasing at an average annual rate of around 15%. The maintenance budget estimate \nfor  FY2006  is  more  than  twice  that  of  FY2005,  demonstrating  an  increased  focus  on \nmaintenance operations.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  These budget allocations are for the PWB road network, and they exclude central Government funding for National \nHighways and PMGSY.

Road Development Plan \n16.  Inefficient transport and communications infrastructure increase transaction costs and \nconstrain the national economy from realizing its full potential. As part of the strategy for \nimproving overall transport sector performance, India has initiated a balanced program of road \nsubsector development under the 10th Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007), which will continue under \nthe 11th Five Year Plan (2008\u20132012). The program aims to increase the capacity of the road \nnetwork, as well as improve (i) maintenance of rural roads, (ii) road safety, (iii) riding quality of \nnational highways, (iv) rural connectivity with all-weather roads, and (v) access to intermodal \nterminals. The two main components of that program are the National Highway Development \nProgram (NHDP),11 and PMGSY Program.12  \n \n17.  The state government\u2019s vision, as outlined by the chief minister in 2005, is to reach a \nlevel of economic development that would generate employment and income opportunities for \nits people to achieve a good quality of life and social progress, while preserving the environment \nand nature. Towards this end, the state government has announced an infrastructure plan to (i) \ndouble per capita income, (ii) halve the population living in poverty, (iii) arrest the migration of \nworkers, and (iv) provide universal access to electricity and safe drinking water. The plan \nenvisages investments in key components of the state\u2019s infrastructure system to stimulate \nagriculture, industry, and service industries; and create employment opportunities.   \n \n18.   The  vision  for  road  infrastructure,  as  described  by  the  state,  is  \u201crapid  and  social \nupliftment of the population while simultaneously ensuring balanced regional development and \nspreading the accruing benefits evenly over all sections of the society\u201d. To realize this vision, \nUttaranchal formulated a draft road policy in 2005 with the objective of creating a road network \nthat would provide (i) high-speed connectivity with the rest of the country, (ii) adequate and \nefficient  connectivity  to  all  the  demand  drivers  (tourism,  industries,  agriculture,  and  urban \ncenters), (iii) connectivity to all villages and habitations through roads and bridges, and (v) year-\nround service. The relevant state ministries are reviewing the draft road policy. \n \n19.  The draft road policy will be implemented through the road development plan (RDP) \nprepared  by  PWD  in  2005.  The  RDP  outlines  a  program  of  physical  improvements, \n                                                 \n11  Announced in 1998, NHDP was intended to upgrade 13,146 km to multi-lane standards between 2001 and 2007. It \nwas expanded in February 2005 to seven phases. Phases III through VII are intended to upgrade an additional \n45,000 km, and add a 1,000 km of new expressways between 2005 and 2012. \n12  Initiated in 2000 with the aim of providing all-weather access from main thoroughfares to rural settlements with \nmore than 250 people by constructing and improving the previously used foot paths and village roads.

Physical improvements have been programmed in the RDP using a multi-criteria ranking \nsystem,  which  takes  into  account  the  remaining  life  and  economic  importance  (population \ndensity and connectivity) of the road section.13 The program is divided into three stages, as \nshown  in  Table  A2.5.  Staging  has  been  determined  largely  on  the  basis  of  the  rankings. \nAccordingly,  344  road  sections  have  been  assigned  to  Stage  I.  These  sections  must  be \nimproved within the next 3 years, because they are (i) scheduled for improvement, or (ii) needed \nto link the federally funded rural road and NHDP. The roads included in Stage II have less \nurgency. Road sections assigned to Stage III are both less urgent and less than 5 km long. \nStage III would cover all secondary and tertiary roads, as well as the balance of roads in the \nnetwork that recently have had (or will soon have) periodic maintenance treatment, and would \nrequire more extensive interventions in the later years of the program.   \n \nTable A2.5: Stages of Road Development Plan \nRoad Improvements \nStage  Period  Length  Roads  Cost  \n(km)  (#)  ($ million)a\nI  2007\u20132010  5,650  344  352 \nII  2011\u20132014  5,150  334  262 \nIII  2015\u20132017  6,180  to be determined  346 \n Total    16,980    960 \nkm = kilometers \na In 2005 prices.

Pre-construction  work  on  roads  in  Project  1  has  been  completed,  and  pre-\nconstruction work for Project 2 is expected to start in mid-2006.   \n \nTable A2.6: Projects in Stage I of Road Development Plan \nRoads  Length   Cost   Implementation \nActivity \n(#)  (km)  ($ million)  Period \nProject 1  23  573  58  2007\u20132008 \nProject 2  49  1,270  75  2007\u20132009 \nProject 3  114  1,847  110  2008\u20132009 \nProject 4  158  1,960  110  2009\u20132010 \n  Total   344     5,650  352  2007\u20132010 \nkm = kilometers \na In 2005 prices. \nSource: Road Development Plan (November 2005). \n \n                                                 \n13  As estimated during PWD\u2019s road condition survey (2004\u20132005). The full list of criteria employed for ranking is   in \nAppendix 4.   ", "36  Appendix 2 \n22.  As  shown  in  Table  A2.5,  the  program  of  physical  improvements  and  maintenance \nrequires approximately $960 million,14 which would amount to about $120 million per year in real \nterms over the next 10 years. Based on the state\u2019s budget allocation to PWD in FY2006 of \nabout $150 million, as shown in Table A2.4, the program would require approximately an 80% \nincrease in annual funding. The proposed multitranche financing facility (MFF) from ADB is \nintended to help finance part of the investments under the RDP. An MFF is best suited to \nsupport planned sequential investments, which progressively would elevate percentage of the \nstate roads in good condition to 90%. The Investment Plan under the MFF and the investment \nroad map are in Table A2.7. These investments will be in parallel, and in addition to, the PWD\u2019s \nother road development and maintenance programs.    \n \n23.  To enhance the sustainability of the impact of this large investment, PWD intends to cut \ncosts and improve maintenance by procuring civil and maintenance works under PBCs. Indirect \nbenefits of PBCs include increased opportunities for private sector involvement, and fewer \nopportunities for misappropriation of funds. The lower costs would be derived from economies \nof scale and reduced prices in return for long-term work assurances for contractors. PBCs, \nwhich are generally larger and longer than conventional construction contracts, help contractors \ndistribute  overhead,  and  generate  incentives  to  enhance  construction  quality  to  lower \nsubsequent maintenance costs. This would encourage private road builders in the state to \nconsolidate or expand, and be more professional and innovative. PWD, on the other hand, can \nreduce  the  number  of  contracts  and  variation  orders,  thereby  reducing  opportunities  for \nmisrepresentation of work and ex-gratia payments for expeditious processing. Under PBCs, the \ncontractors will be delegated the responsibility of managing and maintaining specific segments \nof roads, or part of a network, at predefined minimum levels of serviceability. Payments will be \nperiodic lump sums, conditional on maintaining the road at the established serviceability or \nperformance standards. PWD also can use the assurances to leverage a lower price and focus \nmore on monitoring, instead of devoting time to procurement.  \n \n24.  Combined type PBCs would be awarded initially in projects financed from the MFF, \nwhich will be mainstreamed into PWD's standard procurement policy over the duration of the \nMFF. To allow time for preparation, the first set of PBCs is scheduled to be awarded in Project \n2, as shown in Table A2.7. Subsequently, area-wide maintenance works will be awarded under \nPBCs.  \n                                                 \n14  Approximately $1.2 billion when adjusted for inflation.

PWD\u2019s Structure and Responsibilities \n \n1.  The  Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  is  a  statutory  department  of  the  state  of \nUttaranchal under the Ministry of Public Works Department. PWD is headed by chief engineer I, \nwho reports to the PWD secretary appointed by the Public Service Commission of India. The \nsecretary is assisted by an additional secretary of PWD, also appointed by India; and a joint \nsecretary appointed by the state Public Service Commission. The secretaries are responsible \nfor establishing the policy framework and monitoring organizational performance. The current \norganization chart is in Figure 3.1, showing the reporting lines and other senior staff positions. \n \nFigure A3.1: Current Organizational Structure of PWD \n \n \nPWD Minister\n \n \n  Secretary \u2013 Additional Secretary \u2013Joint Secretary\n \n \n  Engineer-in-Chief \u2013Level 1\n \n \n  Senior Staff Officer  Senior State Officer  Finance \nOperations  Establishment Controller\n \n \n \n  Chief Engineer  Chief Engineer \n  Pauri  Kumaun \n \n \n \nSE  SE  SE   SE  SE \nNation al Highways  Circle (5)  Electrical  Circle (4) Electrical \n  Mechanical  Mechanical \n \nAbbreviations: PWD = Public Works Department; SE = superintendent engineer. \n \n2.  For planning, budgeting, and executing work programs, the state is divided into two main \nPWD operational zones headed by a chief engineer. The zones are divided into circles headed \nby superintending engineers, divisions headed by executive engineers, and areas headed by \nassistant engineers. Each AE is supported by three to four junior engineers. In total, PWD has \n9,383 employees: 895 engineers; 2,061 administrative staff; 1,425 field staff, including skilled \nlaborers and drivers; and 5,000 maintenance workers. The maintenance workers are being \nphased  out  though  a  hiring  freeze.  Staff  cost  has  decreased  as  a  percentage  of  the \nadministrative budget from 25% in FY2003 to the current estimate of 16% in FY2005, which is \nconsiderably less than the national average. \n \nB.  Procedural Deficiencies \n \n3.  Clearance Procedures. More than 50% of the PWD road network passes through forest \nareas. As such, PWD must obtain clearances from the state Department of Forests (DOF) for ", "Appendix 3  39\nany major repairs or rehabilitation work on those roads. Clearances for up to 5 hectares of land \nare  issued  through  its  district  offices.  However,  given  the  average  10-meter  rights-of-way \n(ROW) of most roads, the maximum length of a road that a district DOF office can clear is 5 \nkilometers (km). Clearances for longer stretches must be obtained from higher authorities of the \nstate or central governments, which is often time consuming. In a state where the construction \nseason is short,1 those delays have had undermined productivity significantly.  \n \n4.  Excessive Travel Times. The hilly terrain that characterizes the state limits speeds to \n25\u201330 km per hour on most roads. As a result, traveling from each of the two zone offices to \nmany of the respective divisions takes 1 day, and to the circles requires half a day. That \nreduces the time available for supervision and monitoring of works by PWD staff.   \n \n5.  Excessive  Consultation.  Another  factor2  that  affects  effective  supervision  and \nmonitoring  time  is  the  many  state-level  meetings  between  headquarters  staff  and  chief \nengineers; and zone-level meetings between the superintending engineers and the executive \nengineers. Reportedly, an average of 10\u201320 days a month are spent attending meetings, which \nmostly address one outstanding issue and are often do not produce a result.  \n \n6.  Archaic Manuals. PWD\u2019s procedures still contain remnants of the system set up in the \nmid-1850s, and are guided by manuals from Uttar Pradesh. For instance, the outline of the \nbasic organizational structure and job descriptions stem from the Financial Handbook, Volume \nVI that the government of Uttar Pradesh issued in 1974. Likewise, maintenance methods are \nbased on the Maintenance Manual for Roads issued by the PWD of Uttar Pradesh in 1984. \nWhile  supplementary  manuals  and  guidelines  have  been  issued  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  an \nintegrated updated manual has not been produced.  \n \n7.  Inadequate Planning. Planning is limited to preparation of budget proposals for the next \nfiscal year, largely in isolation from state development goals and stakeholder views. Proposals \nare based on quantities from project lists submitted by the districts and inflation-adjusted unit \nrates  from  the  previous  fiscal  year,  and  include  amounts  for  completing  ongoing  works. \nDepending on the central allocations to the state roads sector for the corresponding fiscal year, \nand the share of federal projects in the work program, the state determines and allocates the \nadditional funding needed to accomplish PWD\u2019s work program from its own sources. As a \nresult, road investment has been uncoordinated and unstable. Moreover, this has perpetuated \nthe practice of preparing single-year work programs based on ad hoc criteria, which in turn has \ncreated opportunities for political interference.   \n \n8.  Weak Accounting and Reporting. PWD uses manual accounting procedures, which \nare based on the financial handbook adopted by Government organizations and the Central \nPublic Works accounts Code. PWD does not have (i) a formal system of regular financial \nmanagement  reporting,  (ii)  a  system  of  comparing  actual  expenditures  with  budgeted  and \nprogrammed allocations, or (iii) a practice of exception reporting. The comptroller and auditor \ngeneral of India conduct the statutory audit of PWD once per year through the Office of the \nState Accountant General of Uttaranchal, which is also responsible for the accounting and \nrecord keeping aspects of PWD. The audit report is not received on a timely enough basis to \nallow corrective action to be taken. Further, an external audit opinion is not expressed on PWD \nas an entity.  \n                                                 \n1  About 6 months from mid-February to the end of June, and from mid-September to mid-November. \n2  Highlighted by working groups at an institutional review workshop conducted by the project preparatory technical \nassistance consultants in Dehradun on 10 April 2006. ", "40  Appendix 3 \n9.  Inadequate  Supervision  and  Monitoring.  The  average  observed  service  life  of \nimproved  and  new  roads  is  almost  half  the  established  service  life  for  comparable  roads \ninternationally. For instance, rehabilitation is needed every 3\u20134 years, compared to every 6\u20138 \nyears if properly constructed. This is attributable to construction methods and material that \nsometimes are unsuited for the climate and terrain in Uttaranchal, as well as to inadequate \nsupervision. Limited quality control and survey equipment, visual inspection and other imprecise \ntechniques,3 and limited expertise among the engineers constrain supervision. On average, a \nsupervision  engineer  makes  less  than  three  site  visits  per  month.  Periodic  maintenance \ninterventions are determined through ad hoc visual inspection of a limited number of roads.  \n \n10.  Dated Standards and Specifications. The sequence followed by the junior engineers \nwho prepare bidding documents is site inspection and identification of required intervention(s), \nfollowed  by  preparation  of  bills  of  quantities.  Force  account  workers  perform  typical \ninterventions under routine maintenance, including (i) shoulder repairs, (ii) pothole patching, (iii) \nlandscaping, (iv) removal of minor earth slips, and (v) road sign and furniture repair. However, \nperformance standards have not been established, and evaluation of works is highly subjective. \nConstruction specifications generally are set according to Indian Roads Congress\u2019 geometric \nand pavement design standards.   \n \n11.  Low Value of Contracts and Quality of Contractors. The practice of awarding many \nsmall  contracts  reduces  the  intensity  of  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  attracts  only \ncontractors with limited capacity to perform quality work (Appendix 2).   \n  \n12.  Lack  of  Incentives.  The  opportunities  for  promotion  and  career  development  are \nlimited. More than half the executive engineers and superintending engineers are designated as \n\u201cacting\u201d. Although training courses are available, finding a relevant course at a convenient time \nhas been difficult for most staff. \n \nC.   Ongoing or Planned Efficiency Improvement Initiatives \n \n13.  Reduction  in  Implementation  Delays.  The  chief  secretary  of  Uttaranchal  has \ninstructed district magistrates to conduct biweekly coordination meetings with PWD, DOF, and \nother relevant government agencies to ensure that all clearance applications are approved \nwithin 2 weeks.  \n \n14.  Increased Supervision Capacity. Funding has been allocated for purchasing 100 new \nvehicles, and additional surveying and testing equipment, in FY2006. Legislative approval has \nbeen  received  for  subdividing  the  two  existing  zones,  which  would  enable  the  number  of \noperational zones to be increased to four. Additionally, state approval has been sought for (i) \ndesignation  of  a  separate  chief  engineer  for  externally  funded  projects,  including  National \nHighways (NH), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB); (ii) establishing one maintenance and one PMGSY division in each circle; and (iii) \nestablishing asset development and maintenance cells at the zone level. These changes are \nexpected to increase accountability, enable more delegation of duties to the divisions and \ncircles, increase monitoring of asset development and asset maintenance targets, increase \nfamiliarity with best practices, and increase overall return on investment.  \n \n                                                 \n3  For example, distance is based on odometer readings; pavement thickness is not based on soil strength; quantities \nare estimated using average per km values.  \n ", "Appendix 3  41\n15.  Computerization.  A  Web-based  management  information  and  project  management \nsystem (MIPMS) funded by the World Bank is expected to be introduced to PWD by December \n2006. This would vastly improve asset planning, budgeting, construction and maintenance work \nmonitoring, personnel management, and procurement.  \n \n16.  Draft Road Policy. A draft road policy, covering 10 years through 2015, has been \nprepared to guide road sector reforms aimed increasing economic growth and ensuring an \nequitable distribution of benefits among regions and population groups. Reforms will ensure that \n(i) investment is in line with the Road Development Plan (RDP), or priorities based on sound \ntechnical and economic criteria; (ii) asset maintenance strategies will increase service life and \nprivate  sector  participation;  (iii)  adequate  funds  are  available  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance; and (iv) legislation is in place to promote sector efficiency.  \n \n17.  Improved Planning. The state has prepared a RDP to guide the implementation of the \nroad policy (Appendix 2). Additionally, the state government has approved the creation of a \nseparate unit within PWD headquarters that would be responsible for strategic planning. The \nplanning unit would undertake review and updating of the RDP, programming and budgeting, \nand monitoring and evaluation. The unit will be headed by a chief engineer, supported by \nprofessionals. The organizational chart after the establishment of this unit is shown in Figure \n3.2. \n \nFigure 3.2: Organizational Chart of PWD After Restructuring \n \n \n  Public Works Department Minister \n \n \n \nSecretary \u2013 Additional Secretary \u2013JointSecretary\n \n \n \nRoad Stakeholder Board  Contractor and Consultant Registration \n \nBoard \n \n \nEngineer-in-Chief \u2013Level 1\n \n \nChief Engineer    Additional Engineer-in-Chief  Senior State Officer  Finance \nNational Highways   Quality and Strategic Planning Establishment Controller\n \n \nChief Engineer    Chief Engineer  Chief Engineer  Chief Engineer  Chief Engineer \nExternal Funding  Dehradun  Pauri Almora  Nainital\n \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \n18.  Increased Stakeholder Participation. PWD will establish a road board to increase \nstakeholder participation and transparency of decision making. This board will ensure that the \nviews of road users and stakeholders are considered for strategic planning and investment \ndecision making. The secretary PWD would chair the board, which would include the engineer \nin chief of PWD, as well as six to eight members representing (i) private and public sector freight \nand passenger transport service providers, (ii) consumer protection groups, (iii) traffic police, (iv) \nchamber of commerce, (v) engineering and contractor associations, (vi) the state accountant \ngeneral  or  a  senior  deputy  of  the  office  of  the  accountant  general,  and  (vii)  other  state \nstakeholder agencies.   \n \nE.   Actions Required to Support Efficiency Initiatives \n \n19.  Information Technology. Staff training for MIPMS on data collection and input, and \nreport production will be needed to enhance PWD-wide usage of the system. \n \n20.  Business Processes. Operations manuals and guidelines must be revised in line with \nthe contract administration duties that will ensue from the creation of new zones; establishment \nof the planning division; new civil works procurement methods, such as performance-based \ncontracts; and the need to be more customer-oriented. The state also must finalize the road \npolicy  and  submit  it  for  approval  by  the  state  cabinet,  and  implement  the  organizational \nrestructuring. \n \n21.  Financial management and corporate governance mechanisms must be improved to \nsupport  the  increased  level  of  investment,  based  on  the  RDP.  A  review  of  the  financial \nhandbook, the PWD account codes, and related financial guidelines and procedures must be \nundertaken  to  (i)  revise  and  update  financial  and  management  accounting  and  related \nprocedures, (ii) ensure compliance with related ADB financial management guidelines, and (iii) \nstrengthen procedures necessary to ensure compliance with anticorruption guidelines and good \ngovernance.  A  training  module  to  enhance  awareness  of  these  mechanisms  must  be \ndeveloped, and training sessions conducted.   \n \n22.  Adequate annual financing is needed to implement the RDP if the share of state roads in \ngood condition4 is to be increased to 90% by 2017. An additional $14 million is needed to clear \nthe maintenance backlog.5   \n \nF.   ADB Assistance \n \n23.  To  accelerate  the  reform  process  and  increase  its  impact,  ADB  has  prepared  an \ninfrastructure management component to be implemented under Project 1 of the Investment \nProgram. This component will provide technical support to PWD through a consulting service \ncontract  to  restructure  PWD  and  reengineer  the  business  processes,  develop  a  human \nresources strategy and provide staff and contractor training. The expected outcomes of this \n                                                 \n4  Current condition of the network was estimated by the consultant engaged to develop the road development plan. \nThe estimate for 2015 is based on the length of scheduled for rehabilitation under the investment program plus an \naverage allowance of 150 km per year through the PWD program. \n5  The annual costs of routine and periodic maintenance are Rs1.05 billion and Rs0.95 billion respectively. Routine \nmaintenance costs are based on unit per km cost estimates for 5-year post construction performance-based \ncontracting on PMGSY roads in Uttaranchal adjusted for road width and condition of the existing PWD network. \nPeriodic maintenance costs are based on per km costs for 50 mm bituminous concrete overlay applied on a six- to \neight-year cycle depending on road class.  ", "Appendix 3  43\ncomponents and implementation schedule are in Table A3. The outline terms of reference and \nscope of services for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix 8.  \n \n24.  Organizational  Restructuring  and  Business  Process  Reengineering.  Support \nprovided  for  these  activities  will  cover  revisions  to  operating  manuals  to  reflect  the  new \nprocesses.  These  include  (i)  preparation  and  approval  of  divisional  budget  proposals;  (ii) \nsupervision and monitoring of works; (iii) procurement, particularly state-wide performance-\nbased maintenance works; (iv) use of the MIPMS; and (v) guiding and assisting the PWD in \nobtaining the necessary approvals for the revised manuals. The revisions will be based on \ncurrent requirements and best practices in road construction and maintenance.   \n \n25.  Human  Resources  Strategy.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  skills  needed  to \nimplement the RDP, consultants will prepare and deliver training programs for PWD staff. They \nalso will provide training and guidance for the state road contractors. The main objective of the \ntraining modules is to familiarize PWD staff with the revised manuals.   \n \n26.  Financial Management. Finance and accounting staff deployed at the PWD divisions \nwill  receive  training  on  the  use  of  the  new  planning,  budgeting,  project  evaluation,  and \nmonitoring systems, as well as the MIPMS. Additionally, semiannual reporting requirements will \nbe introduced. A firm of chartered accountants will perform external audits, in compliance with \ninternational accounting and auditing standards, to ensure transparency, accountability, and \ngood governance.   \n \n27.   Risk Management and Insurance. The consultants also will review the adequacy of \ninsurance coverage of all assets, workmen\u2019s compensation, and public liability; and propose a \nrisk management and insurance plan to be considered by the state.  \n \nG.

Environmental Assessment Requirements \n2.  The Government\u2019s environmental impact assessment requirements are based on the \nEnvironment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 1994 \nand its amendment in 1997; the Ministry of Environment and Forest\u2019s (MOEF) Environmental \nImpact Assessment Guidelines for Rail, Road & Highways Projects, 1989; and the Indian Roads \nCongress  Guidelines  for  Environmental  Impacts  Assessment  (IRC:104-1988)  of  highway \nprojects. In addition, the road improvement and rehabilitation activities require also to comply \nwith Forest (Conservation) Act as amended in 1980; Forest (Conservation) Rules, 1981; Wildlife \n(Protection) Act 1972; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 (Amended 1988); \nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 (As Amended in 1987); and Noise Pollution \n(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.  \n \n3.  These acts and regulations (para. 2) require  \n \n(i)  clearance from MOEF in the form of an approved environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) report for all improvements and rehabilitation activities within the purview of \nenvironmental  assessment  notification  and  located  in  the  protected  areas  and \nreserve forest areas;  \n(ii)  clearance from the Uttaranchal Department of Forests to carry out the work within \nforest areas, to use forest land for non-forest purposes, and to fell roadside trees; \nthe department also requires that cutting of trees be compensated by compensatory \nafforestation;   \n(iii)  a no-objection certificate (consent to establish and consent to operate) from state \nPollution  Control  Board  before  establishment  and  placement  of  hot-mix  plants, \nquarrying and crushers, and batch mixing plants; and   \n(iv)  permission from Uttaranchal Ground Water Board to extract water for construction \npurposes. \n \n4.  Based on the Government and Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Environmental Policy \n(2002), the Uttaranchal Public Works Department (PWD) is expected to undertake the following \nfor the roads in the subsequent years:   \n \n(i)  Perform an environmental assessment of each road depending on its potential \nimpacts.  Based  on  these  potential  impacts,  each  road  must  be classified in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nguidelines, using the ADB\u2019s rapid environmental assessment.  \n ", "Appendix 8  67\n(ii)  Perform an EIA and prepare an environmental management and monitoring plan \n(EMP) for each road in category A. An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nand an EMP should be prepared for all other roads or roads categorized as \u201cB\u201d. \nA road will be categorized as A if \n \n(a)  an in-depth assessment of the impacts  and detailed studies are needed \nto prepare mitigation measures;  \n(b)  the  alignments  pass  through  or  fall  within  100  meters  of  ecologically \nsensitive  areas,  particularly  designated  wildlife  sanctuaries,  national \nparks,  other  sanctuaries,  botanical  garden,  or  area  of  international \nsignificance  (e.g.,  protected  wetland  designated  by  the  Wetland \nConvention); or within 300 meters of the coastline or pass through any \ncultural heritage sites designated by UNESCO; and \n(c)  a bypass or realignment is required to avoid ecologically sensitive areas \n(mountainous,  forested  area,  wetlands,  nearby  estuarine,  or  other \nimportant ecological areas). \n \n(iii)  For village roads and light vehicle roads to be improved as part of Investment \nProgram, the IEE will be carried out using the IEE checklist and the standard EMP that \nhave been used by Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). \n \nC.

ADB Responsibilities \n \n6.  ADB will \n \n(i)  review IEE and/or EIA reports, which will be the bases for issuing road approvals; \n(ii)  review summary EIA reports, and disclose them through ADB\u2019s Web site;  \n(iii)  review the performance of the EMP implementation, and conduct due diligence \nanalyses as part of overall  project review mission; and \n(iv)  if  required,  provide  assistance  to  PWD  in  carrying  out  its  responsibilities  to \nimplement the Investment Program. \n \nD.  Compliance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy\u2014Due Diligence \n \n7.  ADB must be given access to undertake environmental due diligence for all roads, if \nneeded. However, PWD has the main responsibility for undertaking environmental due diligence \nand monitoring the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for all roads. The due \ndiligence report, as well as monitoring implementation of the environmental management plan \nas part of the annual report, needs to be documented systematically.  \n \nE.  Public Disclosure \n \n8.  PWD  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documentation, \nincluding  the  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  reports,  are  kept  properly  and \nsystematically as part of the PWD project record. \n \n9.  All environmental documents are subject to public disclosure. As such, these documents \nshould be made available to public, if requested \n \n10.  For a category A road, the summary EIA needs to be disclosed to the public through \nADB, 120 days before beginning approval of the roads.    \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangements  \n \n11.  The  executive  engineers  in  PWD  divisional  offices  have  been  assigned  to  process \nenvironment-related  clearances  for  all  projects  within  PWD.  The  chief  engineer  at  the \ndepartment level and the division office at the district level will monitor execution of PWD\u2019s \nprojects.  However,  PWD\u2019s  activities  have  specific  guidelines  or  instructions  on  managing \nenvironmental impacts. Therefore, with ADB\u2019s requirement to mainstream environmental and \nsocial concerns in its development program, PWD needs to institutionalize such concerns.  \n ", "Appendix 8  69\n12.  To  implement  the  Investment  Program,  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  at  the \ndepartment level has been established with staff seconded from PWD.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    priority in country poverty partnership \n   \nagreement?   \n \n    No    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \nThe proposed Uttaranchal State-Road Investment Program is a part of the state\u2019s infrastructure vision, which \ncovers improvement of the existing road network and provision of all-weather accessibility to rural areas. The \nInvestment Program will help Uttaranchal Public Works Department (PWD) to develop their road network, as \nwell as to build the capacity of road sector institutions at the state level and contribute to effective and efficient \nmanagement of the road assets. About 10,800 kilometers of project roads, including state highways, major \ndistrict roads, other district roads, and village roads, were selected because they offer the best opportunities to \nimprove road network connectivity within the states, and provide a connection between the lesser roads and \nthe national highway network. The Investment Program will be implemented as seven projects, which have \nbeen programmed according to the level of urgency and importance attached to the roads selected for \nimprovement. Pre-construction work on about 570 kilometers of the selected roads has been completed, and \nwill be implemented under the first project (Project 1). The road sections to be improved in Projects 5\u20137 will be \nreprioritized and designed during implementation. The Investment Program will benefit directly the poor living \nin the region, as road transport is the primary\u2014and often the only\u2014form of transport. Thus, an efficient road \nnetwork linking villages, towns, and cities will provide stronger links between remote and poor regions and \nmore  developed  markets.  Infrastructure  development  encourages  other  development  initiatives,  which \ntogether  considerably  stimulate  economic  growth.  Thus,  the  investment  is  expected  to  improve  the \nsocioeconomic situation significantly, and enhance poverty reduction. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nThe project roads are spread across all the 13 districts of Uttaranchal. The planning commission estimates \nthat more than 35% of the state\u2019s population lives in poverty. The sample socioeconomic survey carried out \nalong the roads to be improved under Project 1 indicates that 3 to 6% of the households lived in poverty. \nHowever, the levels of poverty are expected to be much higher in the interior villages of the districts. As a new \nstate, Uttaranchal does not have much data available on the extent of poverty in the 13 hill districts. However, \nestimates show that the people are surviving by depending on remittances (about$72.7 million) yearly from \nmigrant workers all over India. The population in the Project 1 catchment area consists largely of rural people \n(75%), the majority of whom are farmers and unskilled laborers. During the social assessment along the road \nsections, 4\u201311% were found to be involved in businesses, while 19\u201335% of the households were engaged in \nagricultural activities. On average, women spend 4 hours on household activities and 5 hours on agricultural \nactivities per day, and have to travel 10\u201312 kilometers (km) a day. The average distance that households \ntravel to access the nearest health facilities ranged from 3 to 6 km. In most of the districts, the survey reported, \npeople have to travel 6\u20137 km to the nearest bus stop to use local transport. The frequency of local transport is \nvery poor. In most cases, only one government bus is available per day, forcing people to use other forms of \ninformal local transport services. In cases of emergency, people depend on these private transport services, \nwhich cost more. \n \nThe Investment Program will benefit directly approximately 3.5 million people living in the villages along the \nroads. Vehicle ownership among the residents of adjoining areas is low, and generally limited to two-wheelers. \nAs a result, significant operating cost savings are unlikely to be passed on to local road users. However, users \nwill benefit from time savings. The government is involved heavily in the operation of public transport services, \nwith the state governments effectively setting fares. In the hill areas, informal passenger transport services \nprovided by light vehicle owners, which are largely unregulated, are thriving. Freight services are more \ncompetitive, with a large proportion of these benefits likely to be passed on to the community through higher \nservice frequencies. As the Investment Program will improve road surfaces, widen some sections within the \nexisting rights-of-way, and replace bridges, it will reduce travel times and lower operating vehicle costs. With \nimproved roads and better connectivity, farmers will be able to transport agricultural products and perishables \nto neighboring markets more easily. The Investment Program will enable reliable access to social services, \nparticularly health care services and education facilities. It also will benefit those who use the project roads to \naccess district town centers, and the national highway network. People will benefit from lower transport costs, \nlowering consumer prices and inducing economic and social development. The Investment Program also will \ngenerate significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during construction. Unskilled \nlabor (males and females) will be employed directly in road construction and indirectly by providing materials ", "Appendix 9  71\nand services to the construction and maintenance activities. Project 1 will generate about 912,600 person-\ndays of work for unskilled workers, while the Investment Program will generate 8.4 million person days. The \npoverty impact ratio of Project 1 is 0.30.  \n \nThe improved road network also will improve links between the village communities and urban centers, which \nprovide wider marketing opportunities for agricultural and other indigenous products. People will have wider \noptions in buying and selling their commodities. Small and petty village traders may tap bigger markets, \ntransport produce faster, and receive higher prices, instead of depending solely on local markets and \nintermediaries. Road networks not only link the village communities to better markets, but also open up wider \nwork opportunities in distant places. People can shuttle to distant work sites and towns for construction, \nfactory, business, and domestic jobs. When transportation is efficient, people can engage in regular work \nwithout migrating permanently or seasonally. Improved roads also will encourage urban entrepreneurs to \ninvest in commercial farming and industrial activities in remote areas. Villagers may create new business \npartnerships that, in turn, develop their entrepreneurship skills. With more money flowing to the villages, more \nwork opportunities will be generated through multiplier effect and backward-forward links in the economy. \nPeople will have opportunities to open up tea stalls, hotels, garages, and rest houses, which would generate \nskilled and unskilled jobs. With the improved networking and cash management, the villagers can tap into new \ninstitutional credit and financial services. The scope for better management of public schemes also will \nincrease,  which  will  help  people  gain  new  knowledge  on  improved  farming,  land  development,  and \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  natural  resources  through  the  formation  of  economic  and  social \ndevelopment committees. Thus, direct benefits (access to social services, market, credit facilities, new \ntechnology, etc.) and indirect benefits (employment) of the Investment Program will help reduce poverty and \nimprove the quality of life of people. \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nAs part of Project 1 preparation, consultations were held at the level of primary and secondary stakeholders, \nincluding directly affected people, Executing Agency, local administration departments in the Project\u2019s area of \ninfluence, and nongovernment organizations. Issues related to the proposed project development and various \nactivities involved in the planning and implementation were discussed. At the field level, 37 focus group \ndiscussions were held in subproject areas under Project 1 to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the \nProject and its impacts. These discussions involved village administrative officers, men, women, farmers, \nbusiness communities, concerned government departments, and disadvantaged groups. The main objective of \nthese discussions was to ascertain (i) community response to the Project, (ii) community needs and demands \nfrom the Project, (iii) an estimate of losses that the community would suffer, and (iv) steps to mitigate those \nlosses. The directly affected populations were consulted to understand their concerns regarding the road \nconstruction, and to gather suggestions on the types of mitigation measures that should be considered to \naddress the envisaged impacts. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen in the region are involved largely in household work, cultivation, and other agricultural activities, \nspending 12\u201317 hours per day to carry out these activities. The reasons for their road use ranges from day-to-\nday household activities to economic activities, such as agriculture and marketing, for which they travel up to \n10\u201312 km per day. The improvement in road conditions and improved connectivity of village roads to the main \nnetwork will encourage better transport services, thereby improving access for women and children to social \nservices, markets, workplace, higher levels of schooling, and better health facilities. In addition to the \nimprovement in transport services, travel time savings due to improved road conditions will allow them more \ntime  to  make  frequent  visits  to  health  clinics,  access  marketing  and  credit  facilities,  and  seek  better \nemployment opportunities. The project design also includes provision for bus stops, rest sheds with drinking \nwater facilities, and public toilets, which also will benefit women. During construction, women will have the \nopportunity to gain employment in construction and associated activities. Along the road corridor, women \nnormally are involved in roadside activities, such as running small eateries, tea stalls, and pan shops, etc. \nThus, with the envisaged colonies for construction workers and contractors, petty businesses\u2014e.g., tea or \nfood stalls, and groceries, etc.\u2014will flourish. This will benefit women by improving their income-earning \ncapacities. In Project 1, no households headed by women will be adversely affected. However, adequate \nprovision is included in the resettlement framework to mitigate risks and reduce the hardship of women in \nsubsequent  projects.  During  the  Investment  Program  implementation,  women  will  receive  preferential ", "72  Appendix 9 \ntreatment for employment in civil works, and will receive equal wages to men for work of equal value with \nproper safeguards for the safety of their health. \nE.

Investment Program and Project Description \n \n1.  The state government of Uttaranchal has embarked on a 10-year road improvement \nprogram, the Uttaranchal State Roads Investment Program (Investment Program), to support \nthe  state\u2019s  infrastructure  vision.  Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF),  the  Investment  Program  will  have  two  major  components:  (i) \nimprovement  of  about  10,800  kilometers  (km)  of  the  existing  road  network;  and  (ii) \nstrengthening  of  the  infrastructure  management  capacity  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  Public  Works \nDepartment (PWD), which will be the Executing Agency for Investment Program. The first \ncomponent  will  focus  on  improving  the  condition  of  the  road  network  by  carrying  out \nrehabilitation and reconstruction works that are confined mostly within the existing rights-of-way \n(ROW). \n \n2.  Following the Strategic Option Study and the pre-feasibility study, PWD has identified \nand prioritized around 5,600 km of roads for improvement. Of the prioritized roads, detailed \nproject reports based on detailed design have been prepared for 573 kilometers of roads (23 \nroads), which will form Project 1 of the MFF. The scope of the Project 1 road improvement \ncomponent includes strengthening and reconstructing selected sections of state highways (SH), \nmajor district roads (MDR), and other district roads (ODR). In general, the existing single-lane \ncarriageway (3.5 meters) will be retained with some standardization. Upgrading to intermediate (5 \nmeters) and two-lane carriageway (7 meters) might be necessary on technical, traffic, and safety \ngrounds  in  a  few  cases.  Final  selection  of  road  sections,  and  detailed  project  reports  for \nsubsequent projects,  will be  prepared during implementation of the Investment  Program.  In \nProject 1, the resettlement impacts are confined to four of the 23 roads. Four short resettlement \nplans (SRP) have been prepared for these roads. This summary resettlement plan is for those \nfour roads: (i) Dhakia\u2013Gulabo\u2013Pagia\u2013Mukundpur, (ii) Almora\u2013Bageshwar, (iii) Raniket\u2013Mohan, \nand (iv) Kakrali\u2013Thuligarh. As land acquisition will not be required for any of the roads, no legal \ntitle holders will be affected. However, some encroachers and squatters will lose portions of \ntheir structures and sources of livelihood.  \n \nB.  Scope and Objectives of the Short Resettlement Plans \n \n3.  The aim of the SRPs are to mitigate all unavoidable negative social and resettlement-\nspecific impacts caused due to the the road improvements. To protect the rights of affected \npersons (AP) and communities, the plans have been prepared based on survey findings and \nconsultation with stakeholders, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995) and Indigenous Peoples (1999). The issues identified and addressed in the SRPs are (i) \nthe  type  and  extent  of  loss  of  land  and  non-land  assets,  loss  of  livelihood,  or  income \nopportunities,  and  collective  losses,  such  as  common  property  resources  and  social \ninfrastructure; (ii) impacts on indigenous people and vulnerable groups, specifically women; (iii) \nconsultation with stakeholders, and scope of people\u2019s participation in the project; (iv) existing \nlegal  and  administrative  framework,  and  formulation  of  resettlement  framework  for  the \nInvestment  Program;  (v)  entitlement  matrix  with  provisions  for  relocation  assistance  and \nrestoration  of  business  incomes;  (vi)  cost  estimate  for  implementation  of  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation (R&R) activities; and (vii) institutional framework for the implementation of plan, \nincluding a monitoring and evaluation mechanism.  ", "Appendix 10  75\nC.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n4.  The proposed work for all the road sections includes strengthening of existing single or \nintermediate-lane carriageway, and widening of existing single-lane carriageway to intermediate \nlane. The required formation width varies from 5 meters to 7.5 meters in single-lane and \nintermediate-lane carriageway, respectively. The four roads pass through mostly hilly terrain. \nAccording to PWD records, the ROW available varies from 9 meters to 15 meters. Minimization \nof  resettlement  was  achieved  mainly  by  reducing  the  corridor  of  impact.  Based  on  the \navailability of ROW and likely improvement strategy, an agreement was reached with affected \npersons and PWD to reduce the corridor of impact to the minimum required construction width. \nThis helped reduce the resettlement impact considerably in a majority of the road sections\u2014and \nin some cases by 100%. In 19 of the 23 road sections, the resettlement impact was eliminated. \nThe minimization of resettlement impacts for the four road sections are summarized in Table \nA10.1. \n \nTable A10.1: Minimization of Resettlement Impact \nNo. of Affected Families  No. of Families \nRoad Section \nBefore Mitigation  After Mitigation  Saved \nDhakia\u2013Gulabo\u2013Pagia\u2013Mukundpur  52  14  38 \nRaniket\u2013Mohan  413  2  411 \nAlmora\u2013Bageshwar  1422  1  1421 \nKakrali\u2013Thuligarh  39  1  38 \nTotal  1,926  18  1,908 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n5.  After  minimizing  the  impacts  by  adopting  a  suitable  engineering  option,  only  18 \nstructures will be affected. The type and use of various structures, with number of households \nand APs as enumerated during the census survey, are summarized in the Table A10.2.  \n \nTable A10.2: Types and Uses of Affected Structures \nNo. of  No. of \nTypes of Structures  No. of APs \nStructures  Households \nResidential Structures  1  1  4 \nResidential and Commercial Structures  4  4  24 \nCommercial Structures  1  1  9 \nOther Private Structuresa 11  11  50 \nReligious Structures  1  0  0 \nTotal  18  17  87 \nAP = affected person \na The other private structures include boundary walls, private school, kitchens, and vacant room. \n  Source: ADB estimates \n \n6.  Of the 18 private structures likely to be affected, 14 belong to encroachers and three to \nsquatters with no land titles. The four residential-cum-commercial structures that will be affected \nbelong to encroachers. The six APs who will lose the boundary walls of their residences, and \none AP who will lose a portion of his kitchen, are encroachers. In addition, two private schools \nthat  also  will  lose  their  boundary  walls  are  encroaching  on  government  ROW.  The  three \nsquatter households will suffer partial impacts on a commercial structure, a kitchen, and a \nvacant room, respectively. More than half of the boundary walls of the residential structures will \nbe lost, while two residential and commercial structures also will suffer up to 30% loss. The rest \nof the structures will lose only 10% of their total structures. Of the affected structures, 12 are \npermanent, one is semi-permanent, and the remaining five are temporary. \n ", "76  Appendix 10 \nD.  Socioeconomic Profile of the Affected Persons \n \n7.  People living along the roads are from various socioeconomic groups. Of the 17 affected \nhouseholds, about 10 households live in poverty line and two households are from scheduled \ncastes. None of the households are headed by women, or involve scheduled tribes physically \nhandicapped persons. The average size of the affected households is 6.2 people, though one \nhousehold has more than 10. In general, the economy of the area is agrarian. Most of the \nroadside settlers are involved into petty roadside businesses, though about five of the affected \nhouseholds are also employed in the government sector. About 12 households have annual \nincomes of less than Rs20,000, while and remaining have an annual income of about Rs50,000. \n \nE.  Relocation and Compensation \n \n8.  Relocation of households is not envisaged in any of the road sections, as none of the \nresidential or commercial structures will be lost totally. Most of the structures would lose around \n10%  of  their  total  area.  The  APs  have  indicated  of  rebuilding  their  structures  within  their \navailable existing land. For that, they need advance notification and some assistance from the \nExecuting Agency.   \n \nF.  Issues Related with Indigenous People  \n \n9.  In the state of Uttaranchal, scheduled tribes constitute only 3% of the population. Project \n1 will not adversely impact any scheduled tribe households. The tribal population in Uttaranchal \nand the areas affected by the roads is integrated with the modern and dominant population of \nthe state. Tribal groups in the project area freely interact and share their sources of water, \nfolklore, food, infrastructure, and other belongings with the mainstream population and outside \ncommunity. Moreover, these groups have nuclear families and are open to new ideas, such as \nfamily planning and formal education. Therefore, the socioeconomic impacts due to roads will \nbe the same for these people as the mainstream population. In view of these facts, a separate \nindigenous people development plan (IPDP) was not prepared for any road.   \n \nG.  Gender Issues in the Project \n \n10.  Women in the region are involved largely in household work, cultivation, and other \nagricultural activities. They use the roads for their routine household activities and economic \nactivities,  such  as  agriculture  and  marketing.  Availability  of  all-weather  roads  with  safe \nconnectivity and better transport services will benefit the women of the area. Their mobility will \nbe augmented, allowing them to access social services, higher levels of schooling, and better \nhealth facilities. Project 1 roads will not adversely affect any households headed by women.   \n \nH.  Review of Government Policy and Resettlement Principles for the Project \n \n11.  In India, the Land Acquisition Act (1894), which has been amended from time to time, \ngoverns  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  assistance  for  project-affected \npeople. The state government does not have a policy on resettlement and rehabilitation. Under \nthe Land Acquisition Act, compensation is paid only to the legal titleholders. Non-titleholders, \nsuch  as  encroachers,  squatters,  etc.,  are  not  entitled  to  compensation.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  adopted  a  national  policy  on  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  (NPRR)  on \nproject-affected families, known as NPRR-2004, to address development-induced resettlement. \nThe policy essentially addresses the need to (i) provide succor to the asset-less rural poor; and \n(ii)  support  the  rehabilitation  efforts  of  the  resource-poor  sections,  particularly  small  and ", "Appendix 10  77\nmarginal farmers, scheduled castes and tribes, and women who have been displaced. For \nacquisition of strips of land for railway lines, highways, transmission lines, and pipelines, only an \nex gratia payment of Rs10,000 per family is to be paid under NPRR. This policy does not \nrecognize squatters and encroachers, and no provision is made for resettlement assistance and \ntransitional  allowances,  etc.  Despite  these  provisions,  the  policy  does  not  restrict  the \ncompensation  of  lost  assets  to  replacement  cost.  Based  on  this  analysis  of  Government \nprovisions  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  project-specific  R&R \nmeasures have been formulated.  \n \n12.  In  accordance  with  the  R&R  measures  suggested  for  the  Investment  Program,  all \naffected households and persons will be entitled to a combination of compensation packages \nand resettlement assistance. The support will depend on the nature of ownership rights of lost \nassets and scope of the impacts, including the socioeconomic vulnerability of the APs. The APs \nwill  be  entitled  to  the  following  five  types  of  compensation  and  assistance  packages:  (i) \ncompensation  for  the  loss  of  land,  and  crops  or  trees  at  their  replacement  value;  (ii) \ncompensation for structures (residential or commercial) and other immovable assets at their \nreplacement value; (iii) assistance in lieu of the loss of business or wage income; (iv) assistance \nfor shifting; and (v) rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources or facilities.  \n \n13.  Compensation for the lost assets of APs will be paid based on replacement value. \nResettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods will be provided to titleholders and non-\ntitleholders,  such  as  people  with  traditional  or  customary  land  rights,  and  roadside \nresidences/owners with permits from local agencies to which they are paying annual tax for the \nsame. The vulnerable group comprises (i) APs living in poverty, (ii) scheduled castes and tribes, \n(iii) households headed by women, and (iv) the elderly and disabled. An entitlement matrix \n(Table A10.3) has been developed, which recognizes and lists various types of losses resulting \nfrom  a  project,  and  provides  for  compensation  and  resettlement  packages.  Further, \ncompensation and assistance will be paid to APs in the first section of each contract package, \nbefore commencement of civil works in first section and displacement or dispossession of \nassets. The subsequent sections under each contract package will be handed over to the \ncontractor only after compensation/assistance to the APs is completed for each of the sections. \n \nTable A10.3: Entitlement Matrix \nUnit of \n  Type of Loss  Entitlement  Details \nEntitlement \n1  Loss of   Households  (cid:131) No compensation for land  (cid:131) Encroachers will be notified and given \nresidential and  who have  (cid:131) Compensation for structures to only  a time in to remove their assets and \ncommercial  illegally  vulnerable household  harvest their crops. \nstructure  by  extended  (cid:131) Shifting assistance for vulnerable  (cid:131) Compensation for structures at \nencroachers   their legally  encroachers  replacement cost to the vulnerable \nowned land  (cid:131) R&R assistance only to vulnerable  households. \nor property  households  (cid:131) Training would be provided to \nonto public or  (cid:131) Right to salvage materials  upgrade the skills of the APs \nother private  belonging to vulnerable groups who \nland  lost their commercial structures. \n(cid:131) Shifting allowance of Rs1,500\u20132,500 \nor lump sum for shifting depending on \nthe type of structure and extent of \nimpact. \n(cid:131) Right to salvage materials from the \ndemolished structure. \n2  Loss of  Households  (cid:131)  No compensation for land  (cid:131) Compensation for loss of structure at ", "78  Appendix 10 \nUnit of \n  Type of Loss  Entitlement  Details \nEntitlement \nresidential and  living or  (cid:131)  Compensation for structures.  replacement cost.  \ncommercial  earning their  (cid:131)  Shifting assistance  (cid:131) A lump sum shifting amount of \nstructure by  livelihood by  (cid:131)  R&R assistance  Rs1500\u20132500 depending on the type \nsquatters or  illegally  (cid:131)  Right to salvage materials  of structure. \ninformal settlers  occupying  (cid:131) Squatters or informal settlers will be \npublic or  notified and given a time to remove \nprivate land  their assets. \n(cid:131) Transitional allowance of Rs3000 for \n3\u20136 months, depending on the extent \nof impact.  \n(cid:131) Training would be provided to \nupgrade the skills to the APs who \nlose their commercial structures. \n(cid:131) Right to salvage material from the \ndemolished structure. \n(cid:131) Project-assisted relocation option will \nbe provided to those whose \nresidential or commercial structures \nbecome unlivable as a result of \nproject impacts.

The entitlement matrix was based on a social assessment carried out on the Project 1 \nroads. During loan implementation, if additional impacts are identified, the entitlement matrix will \nbe updated by including provision of compensation and assistance for the additional impacts in \nthe short resettlement plans. ", "Appendix 10  79\nI.  Consultation and Public Participation \n \n15.  All relevant aspects of project planning and development were discussed with primary \nand secondary stakeholders, including directly affected people, Executing Agency, and other \nlocal administrative agencies and departments. The directly affected population was consulted \nto understand their concerns and receive their suggestions on the types of mitigation measures \nthat should be considered to address them. At the field level, 37 focus group discussions were \nheld for all 23 roads. To ensure a comprehensive perspective on the project and its impacts, \nthese discussions involved (i) village panchayats, (ii) village administrative officers, (iii) men, (iv) \nwomen, (v) farmers, (vi) business communities, (vii) concerned government departments, and \n(viii) disadvantaged groups. Further, the consultations and discussions with the project-affected \npeople will continue throughout the implementation of the Program. A local nongovernment \norganization (NGO) will assist the project implementation units (PIU) with it. The NGO involved \nin the resettlement implementation activities will keep the APs informed about the impacts, \ncompensation,  and  assistance  proposed  for  them;  and  will  facilitate  in  addressing  any \ngrievances. The summary of the short resettlement plans and the entitlement matrix will be \ntranslated into the local language; disclosed to the APs; and made available at the offices of \nPWD and project management unit (PMU) and on the ADB Web site.  \n \nJ.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n16.  PWD has set up a project management unit (PMU) in Dehradun, which will be functional \nfor  the  duration  of  the  Project.  For  resettlement  activities,  the  PMU  will  handle  overall \ncoordination, planning, implementation, and financing. The PMU will create a resettlement cell, \nwith appointment of a resettlement officer (the rank of an executive engineer) and required \nsupport staff for the duration of the Project, to ensure timely and effective implementation of \nRPs. The consultant appointed by PWD for preparation of RPs for Project 2 roads will assist the \nresettlement officer. A social development or resettlement specialist under the loan-financed \nsupervision consultant will be responsible for implementation of the RPs for subsequent roads. \nPIU will be established at PWD circle level for implementation of the project. The PMU will \ncoordinate with PIUs for road-level, RP-related activities, and each PIU will designate one \nsenior  staff  (not  below  the  rank  of  an  executive  engineer)  to  coordinate  the  resettlement \nactivities. The PIU, if required by the workload, also will appoint an assistant resettlement officer \n(at the rank of assistant engineer) with adequate land acquisition implementation expertise., \nwho will be deputed from PWD to the PIU or engaged on contractual basis The social or \nresettlement specialist of the supervision consultant will train the staffs at the PIU level for \nimplementation of the RP. The PIU will maintain all databases, work closely with APs and other \nstakeholders, and monitor the day-to-day resettlement activities. In addition, an experienced \nand well-qualified NGO in this field will be engaged to assist the PIUs in the implementation of \nthe RP. Due to the limited resettlement impacts of the project, only one NGO will be hired for the \nProject 1 roads. The NGO would play the role of a facilitator, and will work as a link between the \nPIU and the affected community.  \n \n17.  A grievance redress committee (GRC) at the PIU level will be formed to handle APs\u2019 \ndisputes and grievances, and facilitate timely implementation of the Project. The GRC will be \nheaded by the district collector, or a representative from the collector\u2019s office. The GRC will \ninclude representatives from (i) the PIU office; (ii) APs, particularly of vulnerable APs; (iii) local \ngovernment; (iv) NGOs; and (v) other interest groups. The GRC will meet to review grievances \ninvolving resettlement benefits, compensation, relocation, and other assistance. \n ", "80  Appendix 10 \nK.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n18.  Internal project monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by PMU, PIU and the \nimplementing NGO. An independent monitoring and evaluation consultant (IMEC) will be hired \nfor the external monitoring and evaluation of the Project. In view of the minimum impacts \nexpected from the Project, the external monitoring and evaluation shall be done by engaging an \nindividual consultant with intermittent input during the project period. The PMU, PIU and NGO \nwill be responsible for internal monitoring. The internal monitoring by PMU and PIU will include: \n(i)  administrative  monitoring,  including  (a)  daily  planning,  implementation,  feedback,  and \ntroubleshooting;  (b)  individual  AP  database  maintenance;  and  (c)  progress  reports;  (ii) \nsocioeconomic monitoring, including case studies using baseline information to compare AP \nsocioeconomic conditions, evacuation, demolition, salvaging materials, morbidity and mortality, \ncommunity relationships, dates for consultations, and number of appeals placed; and (iii) impact \nevaluation monitoring, including income standards restored or improved, and socioeconomic \nconditions  of  the  APs.  PIU  will  provide  the  PMU  with  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports \ndocumenting progress on resettlement implementation, and RP completion reports, for review \nand approval by ADB. \n \n19.  For external project monitoring and evaluation, the PMU will engage an IMEC with \nexperience in resettlement activities and familiarity with Government and ADB resettlement \npolicy. The IMEC will be engaged with ADB concurrence within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe IMEC will monitor and verify RP implementation to (i) determine whether resettlement goals \nhave been achieved, (ii) assess whether livelihood and living standards have been restored, \nand (iii) recommend improvements. Monitoring also will ensure recording that APs\u2019 views are \nrecorded on resettlement issues, such as (i) their understanding of entitlement policies, options, \nand  alternatives;  (ii)  site  conditions;  (iii)  compensation  valuation  and  disbursement;  (iv) \ngrievance redress procedures; and (v) staff competencies. The IMEC also will evaluate the \nperformance of the PIU and NGOs. PMU will submit quarterly progress reports, while the IMEC \nwill  report  its  findings  simultaneously  to  the  Executing  Agency  and  to  ADB  twice  a  year. \nFinancial  provisions  will  be  made  under  the  project  budget  for  the  suggested  institutional \narrangements, such as establishing a resettlement cell, appointing a resettlement officer, hiring \nan NGO, and hiring an IMEC. \n \nL.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cost Estimate \n \n20.  The implementation period for the SRPs under Project 1 will begin from third quarter of \n2006 to the first quarter of 2007. The R&R cost estimate for all roads includes (i) eligible \ncompensation and resettlement assistance, (ii) establishment of resettlement unit, (iii) staffing, \n(iv) training, (v) transportation, (vi) monitoring and evaluation, (vii) involvement of an NGO in \nproject implementation, and (viii) other administrative expenses. The cost structure that has \nbeen used in the cost estimates has been derived through rapid field appraisal, and consultation \nwith  affected  households  and  relevant  local  authorities.  This  will  be  updated  during  the \nimplementation. To cover the cost of updating these estimates, an additional provision has been \nmade with 15% contingency. The estimated R&R cost, including implementation cost of the \nProject 1 roads, is about $66,432.
