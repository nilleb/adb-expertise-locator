The  environmental  assessment  and \nreview \nframework  (EARF)  for  the  Uttaranchal  State-Road  Investment \nProgram  (Investment  Program)  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  report  for  Project  1  and  the \nEARF were submitted to the Board and publicly disclosed through \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Website on 17 July 2006. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  a  multi-year  program  of  financial \nsupport  for  the  road  subsector  in  the  state  of  Uttaranchal  to \nimplement part of its road development plan, and to increase the \nroad  asset  management  capacity  of  the  state\u2019s  Public  Works \nDepartment \nInvestment  Program  will  provide \nfinancing  for  seven  discrete  investment  projects,  which  will  be \nimplemented  sequentially  over  10  years.  Each  project  will  have \ntwo  main  components  as  needed:  infrastructure  improvement \n(physical \ninfrastructure  management \n(nonphysical  investment).  The  main  collective  outputs  of  the \nseven  projects  would  be  (i)  10,800  kilometers  (km)  of  state \nroads\u2014about  two  thirds  of  PWD\u2019s  network\u2014improved;  and  (ii) \nenhanced accountability and transparency of PWD. \n \nThe first Project (Project 1) of the Investment Program is designed \nto  help  the  State  of  Uttaranchal  (Uttaranchal)  (i)  improve  a \nsubnetwork  of  roads,  totaling  about  570  km,  for  which  pre-\nconstruction  activities  have  been  completed;  (ii)  initiate  business \nprocess  reengineering  of  PWD;  and  (iii)  increase  PWD  staff\u2019s \nasset management skills. \n \nSupport for business  process  reengineering  will  include  updates, \nwhere necessary, to operating manuals, operationalization of the \nmanagement \ninformation  and  project  management  system \n(MIPMS),  and  mainstreaming  of  strategic  planning  and  new \nprocedures.  Staff  skills  will  be  improved  through  a  long-term \nroad \neducation  and \ninfrastructure  management  techniques.  Awareness  and  skills  of \nthe state road builders will also be enhanced. \n \nThe Investment Program has a special feature to introduce a new \nmethod of works procurement. With this method, performance- \n \n\ntraining  program \n\nleading-edge \n\ninvestment) \n\nand \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\nincrease \n\nin  an  externally \n\nfunded  project,  will \n\nto  procure  physical \nbased  contracts  (PBC)  will  be  used \nimprovements and 3 consecutive years of maintenance thereafter. \nThis  method,  which  will  be  used  for  the  first  time  by  a  state  in \nIndia \nthe \nsustainability  of  the  road  network.  In  addition  to  savings  in  road \nmaintenance  costs,  the  benefits  of  PBCs  include  increased \nopportunities  for  private  sector  involvement.  Cost  savings  would \nbe derived from economies of scale and lower prices in return for \nlong-term work assurances for contractors.  \n \nADB's  financial  support  will  be  extended  through  a  multitranche \nfinancing facility (the Facility). \n \nThe  Facility  will  be  provided  in  tranches  to  support  separate \nprojects  of  the  Investment  Program  when  they  are  ready  for \nfinancing,  provided  that  India  and  Uttaranchal  are  in  compliance \nwith the assurances to ADB, and the investments are in line with \nthe framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \nEach tranche may be financed under terms different from those of \nprevious  or  subsequent  tranches.  The  choice  of  financing  terms \nwill  depend  on  the  project,  and  ADB's  financing  policies  at  the \ntime the tranche is legally documented. \n \nIf India requests from ADB any cofinancing or  related  assistance \nfor  the  projects  from  the  Facility,  ADB  may  assist,  subject  to  its \nrelated policies and procedures. \n \n\n \nRationale for the Facility  More than 90% of intra- and intercity freight and passenger traffic \nin  Uttaranchal  moves  by  road.  However,  about  30%  of  the  main \narterials (state highways and major district roads) and more than \n70% of the collector and distributor roads (other district roads and \nvillage  roads)\u2014about  65%  of  the  road  network  under  the \njurisdiction  of  PWD\u2014need  to  be  repaired  or  rehabilitated.  The \nprimary  reasons  for  the  poor  condition  of  the  road  network  are \ninefficient  road  asset  management  (planning,  budgeting,  and \nsupervision) and inadequate funding. \n \nIndia  and  Uttaranchal  envision  a  reduction  in  poverty  and  an \nincrease in personal incomes by improving personal mobility and \naccessibility  through  increased  investment  in  road  infrastructure. \nThe  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP)  and  the \nPradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY)  Program  are \nimportant  features  of  the  India\u2019s  economic  development  and \npoverty  reduction  strategy.  Uttaranchal  has  prepared  a  road \ndevelopment  plan  (RDP)  to  guide  its  investment  in  roads. \nInvestments  under  the  RDP  include  7  sequential  projects  to  be \nimplemented under this Facility between 2007 and 2017.  \n \nThe estimated cost of implementing the RDP is $1.2 billion.  \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto \n\nfor \n\nfinancing \n\nthe  RDP \n\nIndia.  This \n\nis  committed \n\nthe  next  10  years.  While \n\nAccording  to  the  investment  program  in  the  RDP,  an  increase  of \napproximately 80% in the current level of annual  funding  would  be \nrequired  over \nimproved  planning \nprocedures,  new  construction  and  maintenance  standards,  and \nincreased  supervision  and  monitoring  can  help  reduce  future \nexpenditure,  the  forecast  level  of  state  and  central  government \nfinancing  would  be  inadequate  to  implement  the  RDP  fully.  More \nthan  90%  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  population  and  the  two  main  drivers  of \nthe  economy\u2014agriculture  and  tourism\u2014depend  on  road  transport \nfor intra- and intercity, as well as inter-village, conveyance. As such, \nfailure  to  implement  fully  the  multi-project  RDP  would  perpetuate \nrural  remoteness  and  poverty,  and  exacerbate \nthe  outward \nmigration of labor.  \n \nUttaranchal \nthrough  a \ncombination  of  central,  state,  and  external  sources.  India  has \nrequested financial support from ADB to meet part of Uttaranchal\u2019s \nexternal  resource  needs,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  road  sector \nstrategy \nInvestment  Program  has  been \nconceptualized  and  included  in  the  India  country  strategy  and \nprogram  update  (2006\u20132008)  to  help  Uttaranchal  achieve  its \npoverty  reduction  and  economic  development  goals  by  financing \npart  of  the  infrastructure  and  institutional  capacity  development \ncosts of the RDP.  \n \nUttaranchal  requires  periodic  funding  in  tranches  corresponding  to \nthe sequential projects of the RDP. A multitranche financing facility \nfrom  ADB  is  best  suited  to  meet  this  need.  It  would  allow \nUttaranchal  to  commit  to  its  multi-year  investment  plans  with  a \ndegree  of  certainty  about  the  source  of  financing,  and  borrow \nincrementally  according  to  the  development  road  map.  Such  a \nfacility  also  would  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to \ndevelopment, while closely monitoring progress of the road network \nand guiding development on a project-by-project basis. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  have  an  incremental,  positive  long-\nterm  impact  on  Uttaranchal\u2019s  economy  and  living  standards  of  the \nrural population. The principal outcomes of the physical investments \nunder  the  Investment  Program  will  be  increased  efficiency,  safety, \ncomfort,  and  reliability  of  inter-  and  intra-state  transport  services, \nand lower road maintenance costs. The nonphysical investments of \nthe  program  would  lead  to  (i)  increased  satisfaction  among  road \nusers;  (ii)  more  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation;  (iii) \nmore synergy benefits for the parallel road development programs; \nand  (iv)  improved  governance.  Together,  the  investments  would \nincrease  mobility  and  accessibility  to  educational  and  health \nservices, employment opportunities, and markets for the community \nand enterprises in rural and urban areas of Uttaranchal.   \n \n \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nThe  Investment  Program  is  estimated  to  cost  $830.0  million.

It will be provided in individual tranches from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources.  \n \nEach  tranche  will  be  no  less  than  $50  million,  and  will  be  used  to \ninfrastructure  development  and  capacity  development \nfinance \nneeds identified under each Project. India will provide the proceeds \nof  the  loans  under  the  Facility  in  local  currency  to  Uttaranchal  on \nterms  and  conditions  applicable  to  its  own  lending  modalities. \nUttaranchal will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loans. \n \nIndia  will  cause  the  proceeds  of  each  tranche  to  be  applied  by \nUttaranchal  to  finance  expenditures  of  the  Investment  Program,  in \naccordance  with  conditions  set  forth  in  the  FFA  and  the  legal \nagreements for each tranche. \n \nThe last date on which any disbursements  under  any  tranche  may \nbe  made  will  be  31  December  2017.  The  last  periodic  financing \nrequest  (PFR)  is  expected  to  be  submitted  no  later  than  1  May \n2012.  The  availability  period  will  lapse  12  months  from  the  date  of \nADB  Board  approval  of  the  Facility,  unless  by  such  time  the  legal \nagreements  for  the  first  tranche  under  the  Facility  are  signed  and \nmade effective. \n \nPWD  \n \nUttaranchal  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to \nmonitor,  evaluate,  report,  and  serve  as  its  representative  for  the \nInvestment  Program.  Site-level  management  of  works  and  related \nactivities of each contract package will be assigned to one or more \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs).  The  PIUs  will  be  reporting  to \nthe project director of the PMU.   \n \nA steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of Uttaranchal, \nand comprising the secretary of PWD and secretaries of key state  \n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nits  commitment \n\nin  keeping  with \n\nagencies,  has  been  set  up  to  monitor  the  implementation  of \nInvestment  Program.  It  will  be  functional  within  3  months  of \neffectiveness of the first loan.  \n \nA road board chaired by the secretary of PWD, and comprising key \nroad sector stakeholders, will be established to serve as a medium \nfor gaining the perspective of road users and sharing information on \nthe outcomes of the Investment Program. \n \nStarting from Project 2, the PMU will prepare and appraise projects \naccording to the frameworks and safeguards agreed with ADB. ADB \nthen will conduct a due diligence analysis of each appraised project \nand  the  corresponding  PFR.  The  PMU  will  finalize  PFR,  with  any \nmodifications  and  revisions  required  by  ADB,  and  submit  to  ADB \nthrough India. \n \nAs  the  Executing  Agency,  PWD,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will \nengage  independent  external  firms  to  conduct  annual  financial \ninvestment  program  accounts  and \naudits  of  project  and \nprocurement, \nincrease \ntransparency and good governance.   \n \nProcurement of works to be financed from the Facility will be carried \nout using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures and post-\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nqualification  method, \nGuidelines  (April  2006),  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  for \nthe  Investment  Program  as  amended  from  time  to  time  (Appendix \n7).  The  procurement  plan  may  be  revised  and  amended,  as \nnecessary,  during  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  The \nmaximum  amount  of  a  civil  works  contract  procured  through  NCB \nprocedures will be set initially at $10.0 million, and will be reviewed \nduring implementation.  \n \nAll works will be procured under PBCs. ADB\u2019s standard review and \napproval procedure will be used for procurement in Projects 1 and 2 \nof the Investment Program. PWD will submit the documentation, as \nspecified  in  the  Guidelines,  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  before \nawarding  the  Procurement  contracts.  ADB  may  allow  post  facto \napproval  procedures  starting  with  Project  3,  if  Uttaranchal  is \ndeemed to have followed satisfactorily the procedures in Projects 1 \nand 2.  \n \nManagement  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing for projects to be financed from the Facility. \n\nto \n\n \nConsultants will be used for design and construction supervision of \nall roads, and for technical and other specialist support to the PMU. \nPWD  will  engage  program  support  consultants  individually  or \nthrough consulting companies. Supervision consultants in Project 1 \nwould provide about 1,000 person-months of inputs. In addition,  \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nAdvance Contracting \nand Retroactive \nFinancing \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\f \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\ntravel \n\nPWD  would  procure  about  90  person-months  of  services  from \nprogram  support  consultants.  The  consultants  financed  from  the \nFacility  would  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime  to  time),  and  other  arrangements  for  recruitment  of  national \nconsultants acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  main  immediate  benefit  streams  of  the  Investment  Program \ntime,  and \nin  vehicle  operating  costs, \ninclude  savings \nmaintenance  costs  stemming  from  the  physical  improvements. \nHowever, a large part of the road network lies in rolling terrain at high \naltitudes,  which  makes  the  costs  of  construction  and  maintenance \ngenerally higher than in level terrain. As such, the net benefits in the \ninitial years are not expected to be high. Moreover, many direct and \nindirect  benefits  from  the  nonphysical  parts  of  the  Investment \nProgram  are  not  expected  until  the  latter  years.  These  benefits \ninclude  (i)  systematic  planning  and  programming;  (ii)  staff  training; \n(iii) improved financial management and governance; and (iv) PBCs. \nThe  adoption  of  PBCs  can  generate  savings  of  up  to  20%. \nAdditionally,  PBCs  would  encourage  innovations  in  materials  and \nequipment. \n \nDespite  the  relatively  small  benefits,  as  well  as  the  high  cost  of \nphysical works due to terrain conditions, the economic rate of return \nof  Project  1  is  16.3%,  and  the  net  present  value  at  a  12%  discount \nrate is $14.4 million equivalent. The poverty impact ratio of Project 1 \nis 0.30.  \n \nThe roads to be improved under the Investment Program are spread \nacross all 13 districts of the state, and would be accessible to about \n3.5  million  people  living  in  adjacent  villages.  The  physical  works \nplanned under the Investment Program will require about 8.4 million \nperson-days of input.  Project 1 would require about 900,000 person-\ndays  of  direct  input  from  unskilled  workers.  Moreover,  about  $7.5 \nmillion  in  benefits  would  accrue  to  road  users  in  the  form  of  travel \ntime savings from Project 1. \n \nThe main risk of poor performance of the Investment Program arises \nfrom possible project preparation delays, implementation delays, and \nlow  quality  of  physical  outputs.  To  minimize  this  risk,  ADB  has \nagreed on a feasible schedule and a systematic procedure for PFR \nsubmissions. Projects have been scheduled and sequenced to allow \nthe capacity enhancement initiatives, including staff training, to take \neffect. Consultant support is provided to PWD to help anticipate the \nfactors in the critical paths of project implementation schedules, and \nto  take  advance  contracting  to  minimize  such  delays.  The  planned \nengagement  of  consultants  for  supervision  of  works,  safeguard \nmonitoring, and the opportunities to select contractors from a larger \npool  due  to the  increased  size  of  the  contract  packages  will  reduce \nthe risk of poor quality.

\n\n \n\nI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1.  \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (the  Facility)  to  India  for  the  Uttaranchal  State-Road  Investment \nProgram1 (Investment Program).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA.  \n \n2. \nUttaranchal\u2019s  transportation  system,  comprising  road,  rail,  and  air,  does  not  meet \nadequately the current demand for intra- and intercity passenger and freight movement. Air and \nrail transport serve the intercity market, while road transport serves both interstate and intrastate \nmarkets. The only scheduled air service2 is between the state capital Dehradun and New Delhi, \nand  is  infrequent  and  unreliable.  Roads  connecting  the  four  rail  termini  inside  the  southern \nfringe  of  the  state  are  inadequate  to  offer  intermodal  or  multimodal  freight  and  passenger \nservices. Consequently, more than 90% of the passenger and freight traffic moves by road. \n \n3.  \nThe road network is made up of about 36,000 kilometers (km) of links ranging from two-\nlane highways to foot paths. Public investment in roads has risen from about $91 million in 2001 \nto  $150  million  in  2006.  Yet,  about  a  quarter  of  the  state\u2019s  small  villages  and  habitations  are \nunconnected or only seasonally connected to collector and distributor roads. The Public Works \nDepartment  (PWD)  of  Uttaranchal  is  responsible  for  planning,  designing,  constructing,  and \nmaintaining  about  17,000  km  of  the  network  roads,3 of  which  about  7%  are  built  to  two-lane \nstandards  and  around  60%  are  paved.  PWD  performs  routine  maintenance,  and  all  capital \nworks  are  outsourced  to  private  contractors  through  competitive  bidding.  The  average  service \nlife  of  a  rehabilitated  road  has  remained  between  3  and  4  years,  about  half  the  international \nbenchmark, largely due to the poor construction and maintenance.  \n \n4. \nAbout 30% of the main arterials (state highways and major district roads) and more than \n70%  of  the  collector  and  distributor  roads  (other  district  roads  and  village  roads)\u2014about  two \nthirds  of  PWD\u2019s  network\u2014need  to  be  repaired  or  rehabilitated.  The  poor  surface  condition, \ncoupled with low capacity due to the narrow alignments in hilly terrain, seasonal traversability of \nroads  at  higher  altitudes,  and  increasing  traffic,  is  causing  speed  and  reliability  of  transport \nservices  to  decline  gradually.  The  resulting  delays  are  limiting  the  growth  of  the  agriculture \nsector in particular, which contributes one third of the state\u2019s net domestic product and employs \n58%  of  the  workforce.  Reportedly,  around  75%  of  the  state\u2019s  fresh  produce  reaches  the \nmarkets. The tourism industry, which depends heavily on visitors to some of the country\u2019s most \nrevered shrines in the northern parts of the state, also is suffering due to the lack of year-round \naccess to those locations. Consequently, the earning potential of small farmers and businesses \nremains low, and poverty persists in the rural areas. \n \n5. \nVehicle registration data shows that the number of motor vehicles has increased at  an \naverage  annual  rate  of  about  15%  since  2001.  The  rise  in  the  two-  and  three-wheelers  in  the \ncities and townships has fueled a large part of that increase.  At  the  end  of  January  2006,  the   \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Introduced in 2004. \n3   Comprising 437 km of state roads, 1,369 km of major district roads, 6,910 km of other district roads, 5,631 km of \n\nlight vehicle roads, and 2,633 km of village roads.  \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \n\nnumber  of  registered  vehicles  in  the  state  had  reached  about  650,000,  with  two-  and  three-\nwheelers  accounting  for  more  than  three  quarters  of  that  total.  State  agencies  have  indicated \ncorresponding  increases  in  network  traffic  in  the  past  3  years.  The  average  daily  traffic  on \nselected roads, estimated from 7-day counts taken during the Investment Program preparation,4 \nranged from 100 to 700. This confirms that volume is correlated to road quality (i.e., some major \ndistrict and other district roads in better condition carry more traffic than the higher class state \nhighways in poor condition), not the class of road.   \n \nState authorities have reported that road freight and passenger services are available in \n6. \nmore parts of the state than in 2001. While freight transport operators in the state are entirely \nprivate, the State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC) and private operators provide passenger \nservices.  Service  quality  offered  by  private  operators  is  not  significantly  different  from  SRTC\u2019s \nservices.  SRTC  provides  mostly  line-haul  services  on  35  major  routes  using  conventional \nbuses, while private operators, under a regime of permits issued by state transport authorities, \nprovide both line-haul and door-to-door services using pickup trucks. SRTC has published fare \nschedules  and  timetables,  while  private  operators\u2019  services  are  unscheduled,  \u201con-demand\u201d, \ncostlier,  and  also  carry  freight.  Surveys  conducted  as  part  of  Investment  Program  preparation \nhave showed that, even on routes operated by SRTC, passengers rely more on costlier private \ntransport  due  to  the  low  frequency  of  SRTC  services.  The  higher  fares  of  private  operators, \nmany  of  whom  are  individual  vehicle  owners,  are  partly  a  result  of  the  added  convenience  of \nmore direct  services.  In  addition,  the  permits,  which  limit  the  number  of  passengers  that  each \noperator can carry and the routes on which they can operate, also contribute to the higher fares. \nVehicle owners have formed associations in their operating areas to lobby Uttaranchal for better \nroads, more flexible permits, and lower taxes to enable them to increase capacity and improve \nthe quality of service. \n \n7. \nIntercity  freight  is  transported  in  two-axle  trucks,  which  constitute  the  bulk  of  the \ncommercial vehicles registered in the state. An increase in multi-axle vehicles has been noted \non  state  highways  since  the  introduction  of  the  axle-based  taxes  in  2005.  Field  observations, \nsurveys,  and  personal  interviews  have  indicated  that  demand  for  intercity  freight  services  is \nsignificantly higher than the supply. Specialized vehicles, such as freezer trucks and semi-trailer \ntrucks, are in particularly short supply. This, in concert with rising fuel prices, poor condition of \nroad  surfaces,  accidents,  and  inadequate  financing  for  truck  owners,  has  caused  the  cost  of \nroad  transport  to  rise  substantially  in  the  past  2  years.  Nationally,  transport  costs  on  average \naccount  for  nearly  one  third  of  the  total  product  cost,  compared  with  10%  or  less  in  more \ndeveloped  countries.  This  incremental  factor  cost  constrains  the  expansion  of  rural  industries \nand the progress of rural communities. A detailed analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix \n2. \n \nB.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nConstraints \n\n1.  \n \n \n8. \nDespite  the  extensive  length  of  the  network,  the  road  subsector  has  been  unable  to \ncontribute adequately to economic growth due to the inadequacy of transport services between \nhabitations and centers of economic and social activity. The relative inadequacy of the transport \nservices  is  caused  by  the  (i)  hilly  and  rolling  terrain;  (ii)  poor  condition  of  the  existing  network \nroads;  and  (iii)  missing  links.  Road  transport  is  the  only  viable  mode  due  to  the  terrain,  which \n\n                                                 \n4   The  Investment  Program  was  prepared  between  November  2005  and  May  2006  with  ADB  support:  ADB.  2005. \nTechnical Assistance to India for Uttaranchal State Roads. Manila (TA 4607, approved on 1 July, for $208,000).  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nalso  limits  the  directness  of  routes.  However,  the  present  approach  to  road  infrastructure \nmanagement has to be modified to improve the road conditions and provide the missing links.  \n \n9. \nInfrastructure  management  can  be  improved  by  better  strategic  state-wide  planning. \nCurrently,  PWD\u2019s  divisions  (lowest  operational  level)  are  responsible  for  road  development \nprogramming  and  budgeting.  Those  programs  and  budgets  are  transmitted  through  the  circle \nand zone channels (the next higher administrative levels) to the office of the head of PWD. The \nhead  of  PWD  collates  this  information  into  an  annual  capital  works  and  routine  maintenance \nfunding request, which is submitted to the state. The budget that the state approves is allocated \nto  the  divisions  in  proportion  to  the  requests.  However,  capital  works  receive  a  higher  priority \nthan maintenance of existing roads.  \n \nProcurement  procedures  are  another  infrastructure  management  constraint.  Although \n10. \nprocurement  is  based  on  competitive  bidding,  the  method  of  packaging  works  does  not  offer \nincentives, such as assurances of future work opportunities, which allow contractors to develop \nand  improve  quality.  Contracts,  typically  valued  between  $0.2  million  and  $1.0  million,  have \nattracted  only  local  contractors.  This  has  prevented  PWD  from  achieving  economies  of  scale \nand  developing  local  contractors\u2019  capacity.  Inadequate  supervision  of  contractors,  lack  of \nmonitoring of asset performance based on consistent standards and specifications, and the vast \ngeographical scope of the operational zones also have affected the road network condition.  A \ndetailed assessment of the constraints and their implications are in Appendix 3. \n \n\n2.  \n\nOpportunities \n\n \nInefficient  transport  and  communications  infrastructure  increases  transaction  costs  and \n11. \nconstrains  the  national  economy  from  realizing  its  full  potential.  As  part  of  the  strategy  for \nimproving  transport  sector  performance,  India  has  initiated  a  balanced  program  of  road \nsubsector development under the 10th Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007), which will continue under \nthe  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (2008\u20132012).  The  program  aims  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  road \nnetwork, as well as improve (i) maintenance of rural roads, (ii) road safety, (iii) riding quality of \nnational  highways,  (iv)  rural  connectivity  with  all-weather  roads,  and  (v)  access  to  intermodal \nterminals.  The two main components of that program are the National Highway Development \nProgram (NHDP),5 and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Program.6  \n \n12. \nUttaranchal\u2019s  vision  to  \u201creach  a  level  of  economic  development  that  would  generate \nemployment and income opportunities for its people to achieve a good quality of life and social \nprogress  while  preserving  the  environment  and  nature.\u201d7 Towards  this  end,  Uttaranchal  has \nannounced an infrastructure plan to (i) double per capita income, (ii) halve the population living \nin  poverty,  (iii)  arrest  the  migration  of  workers,  and  (iv)  provide  universal  access  to  electricity \nand  safe  drinking  water.  The  plan  envisages  investments  in  key  components  of  the  state\u2019s \ninfrastructure  system  to  stimulate  agriculture,  industry,  and  service  industries;  and  create \nemployment opportunities.  \n\n                                                 \n5   Announced in 1998, NHDP was intended to upgrade 13,146 km to multi-lane standards between 2001 and 2007. It \nwas  expanded  in  February  2005  to  seven  phases.  Phases  III  through  VII  are  intended  to  upgrade  an  additional \n45,000 km, and add a 1,000 km of new expressways, between 2005 and 2012. \n\n6   The program was initiated in 2000 by the Government of India  with  the  aim  of  providing  all-weather  access  from \nmain  thoroughfares  to  rural  settlements  with  more  than  250  people  by  constructing  and  improving  the  previously \nused foot paths and village roads.   \n\n7   Uttaranchal:  a  state  on  the  move.  Additional  Secretary  &  Infrastructure  Development  Commissioner,  State  of \n\nUttaranchal.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\n13.   Uttaranchal\u2019s  vision  for  road  infrastructure  is  \u201crapid  and  social  upliftment  of  the \npopulation  while  simultaneously  ensuring  balanced  regional  development  and  spreading  the \naccruing  benefits  evenly  over  all  sections  of  the  society.\u201d8 To  realize  this  vision,  Uttaranchal \nformulated a draft road policy in 2005 with the objective of creating a road network that would \nprovide  (i)  high-speed  connectivity  with  the  rest  of  the  country,  (ii)  adequate  and  efficient \nconnectivity  to  all  the  demand  drivers  (tourism,  industries,  agriculture,  and  urban  centers),  (iii) \nconnectivity  to  all  villages  and/or  habitations  through  roads  and  bridges,  and  (v)  year-round \nservice. The relevant state ministries are reviewing the draft road policy. The policy emphasizes \npreserving road network investments through asset maintenance strategies, including the wider \nuse of performance-based contracts (PBC); and developing the capacity of PWD to support the \npolicy objectives.   \n \nThe  draft  road  policy  will  be  implemented  through  the  road  development  plan  (RDP) \n14. \nprepared  by  PWD  in  November  2005.  The  RDP  outlines  a  multi-project  program  of  physical \nimprovements and maintenance strategies designed to (i) surface all network roads that are not \nsurfaced; (ii) upgrade safety features on roads to meet Indian Roads Congress standards; (iii) \nprovide  road  links  to  all  social  facilities  that  are  more  than  1.5  km  from  any  habitation;  (iv) \nprovide road links to all tourist centers and 60%\u201370% of pilgrimage centers; (v) maintain 85% of \nthe  network  roads  in  good  condition  by  2015;  and  (vi)  outsource  all  maintenance  works  on  a \ncompetitive basis through PBCs. \n \n15. \nA  study  commissioned  by  PWD  in  2005  demonstrated  that  substantial  economies  of \nscale can be gained from a well-executed RDP that is supported by stable, long-term financing. \nAccordingly, Uttaranchal intends to finance capital costs through external borrowings, and divert \na higher portion of the state\u2019s funds to asset preservation. To boost preservation efforts, state \ntaxes on multi-axel vehicles have been lowered with the intent of encouraging the replacement \nof two-axle vehicles by the more \u201cpavement-friendly\u201d multi-axel vehicles, which cause a quarter \nof the damage. The improvements to roads would encourage the shift to multi-axle trucks due to \nthe expected lowering of operating costs and increased maneuverability.  \n \n16. \nUttaranchal  expects  the  RDP  to  increase  the  benefits  of  past  and  future  investment \nunder four national road development programs,9 which depend on the level of the connectivity \nprovided  to  them  through  the  state  highways  and  district  roads.  Of  those  four  programs, \nPMGSY has enabled people in 60% of the 15,672 villages in the state to gain access to a main \nthoroughfare  by  direct  or  indirect  all-weather  links  (paved  roads).  Another  1,935  villages  have \nbeen  identified  for  connections,  of  which  472  connections  have  been  sanctioned  by  the \nGovernment  of  India.  At  the  end  of  April  2006,  93  villages  had  been  connected,  and  the  rest \nwere expected to be connected by 2010.  \n \nParts  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  2,107  km 10  national  highway  network  that  radiate  from  the \n17. \nsouthwest  to  the  main  commercial  centers  are  scheduled  to  be  upgraded  or  improved  under \nPhases  III  and  IV  of  the  NHDP.  Phase  III  civil  works  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  2010. \nThat will upgrade a 120 km section of National Highway 72, connecting Delhi and Dehradun, to \nfour-lane  divided  highway  standards.  Under  Phase  IV,  another  640  km  of  single-lane  national \nhighways will be upgraded to two-lane standards, and 780 km of two-lane national highways will \nbe repaired or rehabilitated.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8   Infrastructure Vision.

An  agreement  has  been \nreached  to  establish  a  road  board  to  increase  stakeholder  participation  and  transparency  of \nPWD  operations.  The  State  has  approved  establishing  a  central  planning  unit  under  the  chief \nengineer,  with  a  head  of  division  and  technical  and  administrative  staff  for  (i)  reviewing  and \nupdating  the  RDP  according  to  input  from  the  divisions  and  circles;  (ii)  setting  performance \nstandards; and (iii) monitoring infrastructure performance.  \n \nUttaranchal\u2019s  commitment  to  procuring  works  through  PBCs  demonstrates  a  greater \n19. \nemphasis  on  asset  preservation.  PWD  has  a  broad  understanding  of  the  underlying  direct \nbenefits of PBCs. Fundamental to the success of the RDP, these benefits stem from reductions \nin (i) risk and the number of contract variations common in conventional contracts, (ii) in-house \nstaff  and  equipment,  and  (iii)  single-period  plans  and  programs.  In  developed  and  developing \ncountries, PBCs have achieved 10%\u201320% savings and encouraged technological innovation in \nthe form of new materials and equipment. PWD also is aware of the initial challenges of setting \nperformance  standards,  and  contractor  evaluation  and  monitoring.  Further,  it  is  willing  to  take \nthe necessary action to overcome these challenges, as stated in Uttaranchal\u2019s transport policy. \nPWD  is  confident  of  rapidly  acquiring  the  experience  to  engage  professional  contractors  on  a \nlong-term basis to build and maintain good roads at predetermined standards to provide greater \ncustomer satisfaction.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n20. \nImproving  the  physical  condition  of  roads  must  be  supplemented  by  nonphysical \nmeasures  to  enhance  operational  efficiency,  such  as  (i)  improved  driver  licensing  procedures; \n(ii) awareness campaigns; (iii) increased enforcement of traffic laws; and (iv) emissions control.  \nMoreover,  improved  roads  cannot  meet  the  mobility  needs,  or  fill  the  mobility  gaps,  without \nbetter  road  transport  and  modal  integration.  In  particular,  the  development  of  the  logistics \nindustry and provision of intermodal transportation facilities will be needed in the future to derive \nthe full benefits of the investment in road improvements. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill conduct a regular policy dialogue with the Executing Agency on these issues, and continue \nto  review  and  assist  Uttaranchal\u2019s  efforts  in  key  areas  that  emerge  from  the  dialogue. \nAssistance will be provided through specific components of future projects in the road map and \nInvestment Program.  \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy and Lessons Learned \n\n \n21. \nIn the past 5 years, ADB\u2019s support to the road sector in India (Supplementary Appendix \n1)  has  taken  the  form  of  project  and  sector  loans  to  advance  development  programs  for  the \nnational (NHDP), state, and rural (PMGSY) road network. The NHDP aims to increase mobility \nthrough the provision of better roads, while the state and rural roads programs seek to increase \naccessibility. Support for developing the capacity of road agencies is also a main component of \nADB\u2019s overall transportation strategy in India. Since 2000, ADB has provided five loans to assist \nwith  the  first  two  phases  of  the  NHDP,  which  sought  to  increase  safety  and  capacity  of  the \nintercity  highways.  ADB  is  now  focusing  on  the  subsequent  phases  (NHDP  III,  IV,  V,  VI,  and \nVII),  which  are  estimated  to  cost  around  $40  billion.  ADB  recently  provided  support  for  state \nroad  network  development  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Chhattisgarh.  In  2005,  a  facility  was \nprovided for the Rural Roads II Program.11 Such support, provided through loans and technical \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2005.

ADB and the World Bank have \nadopted  a  coordinated  strategy  for  the  road  sector,  which  was  prepared  in  March  2001  and \nupdated  in  January  2002.  Following  this  strategy,  regular  tripartite  meetings  are  held  with  the \nGovernment  to  discuss  road  policy  issues.  ADB  also  meets  regularly  with  its  development \npartners, shares experiences, and coordinates investment programs.   \n \n23. \nThe implementation of ADB-financed road development projects in India over the past 5 \nyears  have  been  delayed  due  largely  to  lengthy  environmental  and  social  safeguard  approval \nprocesses.  In  particular,  the  need  for  full  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons  and \ncomplete  clearance  of  the  site  before  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  have  delayed \nimplementation. The Investment Program is classified as environmental category A, Involuntary \nResettlement  impact  category  A,  and  Indigenous  Peoples  category  B,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nclassification criteria. However, improvements to the 10,800 km of roads under the Investment \nProgram  are  not  expected  to  have  irreversible  or  permanent  negative  environmental  impacts, \nwhich would require mitigation measures or extensive monitoring that cause delays. Further, it \nwill  not  require  significant  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  of  persons,  and  will  not  affect \nindigenous peoples.   \n \n \n \nAccording  to  the  RDP,  approximately  $120  million  of  additional  annual  funding,  above \n24. \nthe current budget, will be needed in the next 10 years to meet the road condition targets. While \nimproved  planning  and  budgeting  procedures,  new  construction  and  maintenance  standards, \nand  increased  supervision  and  monitoring  can  help  reduce  future  expenditures,  the  forecast \nlevel  of  state  and  central  government  financing  would  be  inadequate  to  implement  fully  the \nRDP.  More  than  90%  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  population  and  the  two  main  drivers  of  the  economy\u2014\nagriculture  and  tourism\u2014depend  on  road  transport  for  intra-  and  intercity,  as  well  as  inter-\nvillage, conveyance. As such, failure to implement fully the multi-project RDP would perpetuate \nrural  remoteness  and  poverty,  and  exacerbate  the  outward  migration  of  labor.  Uttaranchal, \ntherefore,  plans  to  finance  the  RDP  through  a  combination  of  central, 13 state,  and  external \nsources. \n \nIndia has requested financial support from ADB to meet Uttaranchal\u2019s external resource \n25. \nneeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  road  sector  strategy  for  India.  The  Investment  Program  has \nbeen  conceptualized  and  included  in  the  India  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006\u2013\n2008)  to  help  Uttaranchal  achieve  its  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development  goals  by \nfinancing  part  of  the  infrastructure  and  institutional  capacity  development  costs  of  the  RDP. \nUttaranchal requires periodic funding in tranches corresponding to the sequential projects of the \nRDP. A facility from ADB is best suited to meet this need. It would allow Uttaranchal to commit \nto its multiyear investment plans with a degree of certainty about  the  source  of  financing,  and \nborrow  incrementally  according  to  the  development  road  map.  In  turn,  a  facility  would \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s long-term commitment to development, while closely monitoring progress of \nthe road network and guiding development on a project-by-project basis.  \n\nNeed for ADB Support for the Investment Program \n\n                                                 \n12  Public Works Departments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. \n13  Central  sources  include  reallocation  of  state  tax  revenues,  special  grants,  and  budgetary  allocations  for  special \n\ncategory states.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\nRoad Development Plan \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  RDP  is  programmed  for  implementation  as  a  series  of  seven  discrete  projects \n26. \nbetween 2007 and 2017, and specific capacity development initiatives. Its goal is to improve the \n16,800 km state-roads network to national standards, and maintain it in a good condition. The \nRDP  needs  an  investment  of  about  $1.2  billion  over  the  next  10  years.  The  proposed \nInvestment Program would finance part of the RDP. \n \nB.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  have  a  positive  long-term  impact  on  the  state\u2019s  economy \n27. \nand living standards of the rural population. The principal outcomes of the physical components \nunder  the  Investment  Program  will  be  increased  efficiency,  safety,  comfort,  and  reliability  of \ninter-  and  intrastate  transport  services,  and  lower  road  maintenance  costs.  The  nonphysical \ncomponents  of  the  Investment  Program  would  lead  to  (i)  increased  satisfaction  among  road \nusers; (ii) more  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation;  (iii)  more  synergy  benefits  for  the \nparallel  road  development  programs;  and  (iv) \nthese \ninvestments  would  increase  mobility  and  accessibility  to  educational  and  health  services, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  markets  for  the  community  and  enterprises  in  rural  and  urban \nareas of the state.   \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe main outputs of the seven-project Investment Program would be (i) about 10,800 km \nof motorable state roads\u2014almost two thirds of the PWD network\u2014repaired or upgraded,14 and \nmaintained  for  a  minimum  of  3  years  under  PBCs;  and  (ii)  a  proactive  and  accountable  PWD \nthat is better equipped to manage road infrastructure.   \n \n29. \nUnder the first project (Project 1) of the Investment Program, a subnetwork of 23 roads \ntotaling about 570 km would be improved and maintained. Pre-construction activities have been \ncompleted for Project 1. These physical improvements will increase the percentage of the state-\nroad network in good condition from 6% to 10% by 2008. The nonphysical outputs of Project 1 \nwould  be  (i)  staff  skilled  in  essential  areas  of  road  asset  management;  (ii)  a  fully  functional \nplanning  unit  responsible  for  strategic-level  programming;  (iii)  a  road  board  to  increase \ntransparency  and  stakeholder  participation;  and  (iv)  revised  accounting,  planning,  and  asset \nmanagement  procedures  based  on  a  computerized  management  information  and  project \nmanagement system (MIPMS) to increase the operational efficiency of PWD.   \n\nimproved  governance.  Together, \n\nOutputs \n\n \n1. \n\nInfrastructure Improvement Component  \n\n \n30. \nThe  Investment  Program  outputs  will  be  derived  from  the  two  main  physical  and \nnonphysical  components\u2014infrastructure  improvement  and  infrastructure  management.  The \ninfrastructure  improvement  component  of  each  project  will  include  five  elements  (i)  consulting \nservices  for  preparation  of  detailed  project  reports;  (ii)  physical  improvements  (repair, \nrehabilitation, reconstruction) to selected roads to elevate them to a good condition with higher \n\n                                                 \n14  Includes  improvements  to  transverse  and  cross-sectional  drainage;  minor  widening;  paving,  repaving,  or \n\nreconstruction of pavements; and stabilization of slopes. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\ncapacity and safety standards; (iii) maintenance of improved roads according to predetermined \nperformance  standards;  (iv)  supervision  of  physical  improvements  and  administration  of \nmaintenance  contracts;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  program \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation  units  (PIU)  to  administer  contracts  and \nensure  compliance  with  safeguards.  The  roads  to  be  improved  under  each  project  have  been \nselected  and  prioritized  using  a  multi-criteria  ranking  system  based  on  the  overall  vision  of \nUttaranchal, and considering the financial, environmental, social, and technical constraints. The \nlist of prioritized roads to be improved under the first four projects of the Investment Program is \nin Appendix 4. \n \n\n2. \n\nInfrastructure Management Component  \n\n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  infrastructure  management  component  is  to  increase  the \n31. \nsustainability  of  the  investment  by  helping  PWD  restructure  and  adopt  improved  policies  and \noperational procedures, and increase staff skills (Appendix 3). The infrastructure management \ncomponent in Project 1 will include (i) assistance for the planning unit at PWD headquarters to \nstart developing policies, setting performance targets, and programming to ensure road network \nquality  and  consistency;  (ii)  assistance  to  establish  a  fully  functional  road  board1  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  PWD's  senior  management,  transport  users,  automobile  associations, \ntransport operators, and road builders; (iii) revisions to operating manuals for planning, design, \nconstruction, and maintenance in line with the vision and mission of PWD; (iv) training in areas \nsuch as design review, performance monitoring, quality assurance, financial management, and \nthe  MIPMS  to  improve  the  staff\u2019s  ability  to  execute  tasks  under  the  revised  organizational \nstructure and operational procedures; and (v) workshops to increase the awareness and skills of \nstate  civil  works  contractors  on  preparation  and  bidding  for  PBCs,  quality  control,  overall \nconstruction,  equipment  and  labor  management,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard \ncompliance. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nPhysical  works  under  the  Investment  Program  would  include  improvements  to  road \ninfrastructure and performance-based maintenance. This would be the first time a state agency \nin  India  has  agreed  to  adopt  PBCs  in  an  externally  funded  program.  Moreover,  the  Executing \nAgency has agreed to its gradual adoption as the default method of works procurement. PBCs \ncan  generate  substantial  savings,  and  increase  opportunities  for  private  sector  involvement.  \nThe savings would be derived from economies of scale and lower prices in return for long-term \nwork assurances for contractors. PBCs, which are generally larger and longer than conventional \nconstruction  contracts,  also  help  contractors  spread  the  overhead,  and  provide  incentives  to \nbuild  better  roads  to  lower  subsequent  maintenance  costs.  That  would  encourage  in-state \ncontractors  to  consolidate  or  expand,  and  be  more  professional  and  innovative.  PWD,  on  the \nother hand, can reduce the number of contracts and variation orders, which create opportunities \nfor misrepresentation of work and ex gratia payments for expeditious processing.   \n  \n \n\nSpecial Feature \n\n                                                 \n1   The main objective of the road board is to provide a forum for the PWD to soliciting input from key stakeholders on \nthe  performance  of  the  road  network.    The  terms  of  reference  for  the  road  board  as  well  as  its  mandate  will  be \nfinalized with the assistance of the infrastructure management consultants in Project 1.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nE. \n\nInvestment Program Cost Estimates  \n\n33. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  about  $830.0  million, \nincluding  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loans  from  ADB  during \nconstruction  (Table  1).

The salient aspects of the discussions and the main actions taken will be summarized in \nthe quarterly project and Investment Program reports to ADB.    \n \n\nProject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n2. \n \nFor  Project  1,  pre-construction  activities,  including  those  related  to  environmental  and \n43. \nsocial safeguards, have been completed. Resettlement activities are expected to be completed \nbefore the commencement of works. For subsequent projects, PWD, with the assistance of the \nprogram  support  consultants,  will  prepare  a  detailed  project  report,  including  environmental, \nsocial,  and  economic  assessments;  and  a  PFR  for  each  project.  Further,  each  project  will  be \nprepared in accordance with the FFA, RF, IPDF, and EARF agreed with ADB; and criteria and \nprocedures  outlined  in  Appendix  4.  After  appraising  each  project  for  technical  and  economic \nfeasibility,  and  compliance  with  safeguards  and  requirements,  PWD  will  submit  to  ADB  a \nsummary  appraisal  report  prepared  in  the  format  specified  in  the  Investment  Program \nadministration  memorandum,  and  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  perform  a  due  diligence  analysis  in \naccordance with the relevant policies and frameworks, and approve PWD\u2019s appraisal, subject to \nany amendments and revisions. If required by ADB, PWD will revise and amend the PFR, which \nit will submit through India to ADB for approval on or before the PFR due date in the FFA.   \n \n44. \nPWD  simultaneously  will  carry  out  advance  contracting,  such  as  recruitment  of \nconsultants and selection of contractors as approved by ADB, to ensure timely implementation \nof each project.   \n \n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule  \n\n \nThe  seven  projects  of  the  Investment  Program  and  their  subcomponents  will  be \n45. \nimplemented over 10 years, as shown in the indicative implementation schedule in Appendix 6. \nThe detailed schedules for the first four projects have been finalized, and the schedules for the \nremaining  three  projects  will  be  completed  during  the  implementation  of  Project  3.  PWD  will \nprepare  detailed  implementation  schedules  those  projects  during  the  pre-construction  of  the \nprevious project.  \n \n46. \nProject  1  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  4.5  years,  beginning  April  2007.  This \nschedule includes 1.5 years for the physical improvements and 3 years of performance-based \nmaintenance. The infrastructure management component in Project 1 will be implemented over \n2 years, commencing upon the effectiveness of the first loan.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n47. \nDesign  and  Supervision  of  Works.  PWD  will  engage  one  or  more  private  firms  of \nengineering  consultants  for  design  and  construction  supervision  of  each  project,  except  for \nProjects 1 and 2.18 For these two projects, consulting firms will be engaged only for supervision. \nThe  number  of  construction  supervision  consulting  service  packages  needed  for  each  project \nwill  be  determined  based  on  the  scope  and  geographic  spread  of  the  works  packages.  For \nProject  1,  three  packages  will  be  used  to  procure  the  1,000  person-months  of  input  needed.  \n\n                                                 \n18  PWD has financed the design part of Projects 1 and 2 to increase project readiness. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nThe  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  supervision  consultants  for  Project  1  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix 3.  \n \n48. \nProgram  Support. PWD will engage experienced national consultants, financed under \nProject 1, to provide 92 person-months of inputs to help the PMU coordinate and facilitate timely \nprocessing  and  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  activities.  The  scope  of  services \nwould  include  assistance  to  the  PMU  to  (i)  update  the  RDP;  (ii)  prepare  the  supporting \ndocumentation  required  for  the  future  PFRs  and  PBCs;  (iii)  carry  out  technical  reviews  of  the \nsubproject designs, including safeguard compliance; and (iv) prepare reports for submission to \nADB.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  this  consulting  service  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  4. \nAdditional consulting services, if necessary, will be procured in  subsequent  projects  to  ensure \ntimely implementation. \n \n49. \nInfrastructure  Management. PWD will engage an international consulting firm working \nwith  national  experts  to  provide  98  person-months  of  assistance  (14  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  84  person-months  of  national  consulting  services)  to  the \nPMU  to  implement  the  infrastructure  management  component  in  Project  1.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for these consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix 5. Additional consulting \nservices, if necessary, will be procured in subsequent projects. \n \n50. \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nAll consultants financed from the Facility would be selected and engaged in accordance \n\nProcurement  \n\n5. \n \n\n51.  Works  to  be  financed  from  the  Facility  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  procedures  and  post-qualification  method, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  as  described  in  the \nprocurement  plan  for  the  Investment  Program  in  Appendix  7.  The  bidding  documents  and \nprocurement procedures agreed between PWD and ADB for use under advance contracting, as \nalso set out in the procurement plan, will be followed for NCB. Any modifications to these will be \nagreed between PWD and ADB, and further set out in the procurement plan. The upper limit for \na  works  contract  to  be  procured  through  NCB  procedures  initially  will  be  set  at  $10.0  million, \nand will be reviewed during implementation.  \n \n52. \nThe  standard  review  and  approval  procedure  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  and  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  7)  will  be  used  for  procurement  in  Projects  1 \nand  2  of  the  Investment  Program.  PWD  will  submit  the  documentation,  as  specified  in  the \nguidelines,  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  before  signing  the  works  contracts.  Indicative \ncontract packages for Project 1 are described in Appendix 7.  \n \n53. \nIf  PWD  is  deemed  to  have  adhered  closely  to  the  procurement  plan  and  guidelines  in \nProjects  1  and  2,  ADB  may  allow  subsequent  NCB  contract  packages  to  be  awarded  without \nprior review to reduce procurement time. This would increase ownership of the process within \nPWD,  as  well  as  promote  transparency,  accountability,  and  good  governance  practices.  This \napproval  procedure  requires  that  PWD  (i)  retains  records  of  all  procurement  documentation, \nincluding  copies  of  the  signed  contracts  and  the  bid  evaluation  reports  for  inspection;  (ii) \nprovides ADB with a certified summary sheet describing the main aspects of the bid evaluation \nand contract award at the time of each contract award; (iii) engages an independent private firm \nto perform periodic audits of the procurement processes and contract awards; (iv) engages an \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\nindependent  private  firm  of  chartered  accountants  to  audit  the  PMU  annually;  and  (v) \nacknowledges  that,  if  any  contract  award  is  found  to  be  unacceptable,  ADB  may  refuse  to \nfinance  the  contract.  ADB  will  select  contracts  at  random  for  review  to  ensure  that  all  due \nprocesses have been followed.  \n \n54.  Works in any project may be procured under PBCs or traditional works contracts if only \nimprovement works are procured. ADB has reviewed the documents  to  be  used  for  combined \nimprovement and maintenance works procurement, which are based on ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments for small works and  other  national  and  international  guidelines,  and  found  them  to \nbe generally acceptable.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n\n \n55. \nADB  management  has  approved  advance  contracting  for  components  to  be  financed \nfrom the Facility.  Up to 20% of the proceeds of a loan will be eligible for retroactive financing, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred on works and consulting services of a project eligible for \nfinancing  from  the  Facility,  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures  and  during  the  12  months \nbefore  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement.    This  approval,  however, \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project(s) from the Facility. \n \n\n7.  \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n56. \nADB  has  assessed  thoroughly  the  accounting  and  financial  management  policies, \nregulations,  and  practices  of  PWD  (Supplementary  Appendix  9);  and  agreed  on  measures  to \nimprove governance, accountability, and transparency. These measures include (i) independent \nexternal  audits  of  contracts  and  accounts;  (ii)  the  stakeholder  road  board;  (iii)  Web-based  bid \ndisclosures; and (iv) project performance tracking Web-based systems (i.e., MIPMS). ADB has \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  Uttaranchal  and  PWD  the  Anticorruption  Policies  and \nStrategies (1998), as amended from time to time; and its right to investigate, directly or through \nits  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nprojects under the Facility. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policies and Strategies \n(1998) and oversight measures are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents \nfor the projects financed from the Facility. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB from the \nFacility will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of PWD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the projects under the Facility.  \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n57. \nThe  last  disbursements  under  any  tranche  from  the  Facility  must  be  made  by  31 \nDecember 2017. The last PFR is expected to be submitted no later than 1 May 2012, provided \nthat the availability period will lapse 12 months from the date of approval of the Facility by ADB\u2019s \nBoard,  unless  by  such  time  the  legal  agreements  for  the  first  tranche  under  the  Facility  are \nsigned and made effective. For consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works \ncontracts, loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement \nprocedures.  The  PMU  may  use \nthe \nreimbursement procedure for individual payments not exceeding $100,000, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to time.    \n \n\nthe  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  under \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n 9. \n\nMidterm Reviews  \n\nThe PMU will maintain separate bank accounts for each project. The funds drawn down \n58. \nin accordance with each PFR, with the corresponding counterpart funds, will be credited to the \ncorresponding account. Each PIU for a project will submit contractor payment certificates to the \nPMU,  which  will  arrange  for  the  necessary  bank  transfers  to  be  made  into  the  contractors\u2019 \nnominated  account(s).  PWD  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  project  bank  accounts,  and \nfor reviewing monthly reconciliation of the accounts made by the PMU. PWD also will approve \nwithdrawal applications.  \n \n \n \n59. \nADB, India, and Uttaranchal will undertake a midterm review of the Investment Program \nin June 2012.  A midterm review of Project 1 will be undertaken in January 2010.  The timing of \nmidterm reviews of subsequent projects will be agreed upon during the approval of each project.  \nThe  reviews  will  focus  on  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional,  administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects,  and  poverty  reduction.    The \nprojects\u2019 economic viability, and other relevant aspects that might impact performance, also will \nbe  assessed  during  the  reviews.    In  addition,  the  reviews  will  examine  the  implementation \nprogress for the sector reforms, policy development, performance of the road sector as a whole, \nand compliance with assurances in the FFA.  \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n10. \n \n60. \nUttaranchal  has  agreed  to  adhere  strictly  to  accounting,  financial  management,  and \ncorporate  governance  requirements  during  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  PWD \nwill assign to the PMU a professionally qualified finance manager, as well as an administrative \nassistant trained on the new computer-based system. The PMU will maintain separate records \nand  accounts  adequate  to  identify  (i)  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of \neach  loan;  (ii)  the  financing  resources  received;  (iii)  the  expenditures  incurred  on  the \ncomponents of each project; and (iv) use of local funds. PWD will engage independent external \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  consolidated  project  accounts  annually,  and  provide \nopinions on the accounts and statement of expenditure operations. The state auditor general\u2019s \noffice, which also maintains the accounts, will conduct its routine annual audits of PWD, as well \nas the projects and the Investment Program. The independent financial audits will enable PWD \nto submit its audited financial statements and audited project accounts to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n61. \nto-office reports, and after the review of the PFRs.  \n\n ADB\u2019s Board will be briefed annually on the progress through the review missions\u2019 back-\n\n \n11. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n62.  With the assistance from the construction supervision consultants of Project 1, PWD will \ndevelop  an  investment  program  performance  monitoring  system  and  a  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impacts,  outcomes,  outputs,  and  activities  in \nrelation to the targets and milestones set for each project and the Investment Program.    \n \n63. \nAt the beginning of each project, PWD and ADB will agree on a set of baseline values of \neconomic,  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  indicators.  With  the  assistance \nof  the  construction  supervision  engineer(s)  of  that  project,  PWD  will  conduct  participatory \nsurveys, and collect and analyze data at intervals agreed with ADB. Comments and findings of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\nthe  data  analyses  will  be  submitted  as  part  of  every  other  quarterly  report  of  PWD  to  ADB.  A \ncomplete  analysis  of  related  primary  and  secondary  data  on  impacts  and  outcomes  will  be \nperformed  at  completion,  and  3  years  after  completion  of  each  project  and  the  Investment \nProgram. The results, which will be reported to ADB within 3 months, will highlight the positive \nand negative impacts and outcomes of each project and the Investment Program. \n\n \n12. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation  \n\n \nPWD will ensure that the Investment Program is implemented with active participation of \n64. \nall  stakeholders,  using  participatory  practices.  As  part  of  the  preparation  of  Project  1, \nconsultations  were  held  with  stakeholders,  including  directly  affected  people,  and  local \nadministrative  departments.  Issues  related  to  the  implementation  of  Project  1  and  activities \ninvolved  in  the  implementation  were  discussed.  Stakeholder  consultation  and  participation  will \ncontinue throughout implementation. The initial poverty and social assessment report, and the \nshort resettlement plans (RP) for Project 1 have been made available to the public by PWD and \nare  posted  on  the  ADB  Web  site.  For  subsequent  projects,  PWD  will  ensure  that  completed \nRPs, IPDPs, and resettlement monitoring reports are made available to affected people and are \nsubmitted to ADB for posting on its Web site. Additionally, the meetings of the road board would \nserve as a forum for stakeholders to discuss and seek resolutions to significant issues. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n65. \nThe  main  immediate  benefits  of  the  Investment  Program  include  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs, travel time, and maintenance costs stemming from the physical improvements.  \nHowever, a large part of the road network lies in  rolling  terrain  at  high  altitudes,  which  makes \nthe cost of construction and maintenance generally higher than in plain areas. As such, the net \nbenefits  in  the  initial  years  are  expected  to  be  low.  Moreover,  much  of  the  network  has  been \ndesigned to connect low-income hamlets, which generate few daily trips. While improvements to \nthe roads in those areas would increase the people\u2019s level of accessibility to basic services and \nmarkets, the number of additional trips at the outset would be small. Consequently, travel time \nand vehicle operating cost savings in the initial years are expected to be small. However, as the \nInvestment  Program  advances  and  more  parts  of  the  network\u2014including  links  to  the  national \nhighway  system\u2014are  improved,  the  generation  of  passenger  and  freight  trips  is  expected  to \nincrease  substantially.  Moreover,  indirect  benefits  expected  from  the  nonphysical  parts  of  the \nInvestment Program would  increase  and  become  substantial  after  about  the  third  year.  These \nbenefits  would  include  (i)  increased  local  contractor  capacity;  (ii)  systematic  road  investment \nplanning and programming; (iii)  improved  financial  management  and  governance;  (iv)  reduced \naccidents; and (v) walking time savings for bus passengers, which currently are not reasonably \nquantifiable. \n \nA. \n \n66. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  subnetwork  of  roads  in  Project  1  has  been  performed \nbased  on  the  expected  benefits  from  the  physical  improvement  and  performance-based \nmaintenance  of  23  roads  totaling  570  km  (about  3%  of  the  network).  The  benefits  considered \nare  (i)  operating  cost  savings  for  normal  passenger  and  freight  traffic  resulting  from  the \nimprovements  to  riding  quality;  (ii)  travel  time  savings  for  normal  passengers  and  shippers \nresulting  from  the  improvements  in  riding  quality;  (iii)  travel  time  savings  for  passengers  and \nfreight  resulting  from  fewer  temporary  road  closures;  (iv)  savings  in  routine  and  periodic  road \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nmaintenance costs due to PBCs for maintenance; and (v) savings to generated19 and  induced \ntraffic.   \n \n67. \nDue  to  the  low  trip  generation  rates  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  time,  as  well  as  the \nvehicle composition in the project area, the total (discounted) benefits20 are expected to be $48 \nmillion.  The  distributive  analysis  of  Project  1  benefits  has  shown  that  (i)  about  32%  of  the \nvehicle operating cost savings would accrue to car and light commercial vehicle operators that \nprovide  the  bulk  of  the  informal  passenger  services  in  the  hill  areas;  (ii)  about  32%  to  freight \noperators; and (iii) about 14% to formal bus operators. Of the travel time savings, nearly 62% \nwould  accrue  to  passengers21 and  the  rest  to  shippers  (freight).  The  poverty  impact  ratio  of \nProject 1 is 0.30.  \n \nDespite  the  relatively  small  benefits  and  the  high  cost  of  physical  works  due  to  terrain \n68. \nconditions,  the  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  Project  1  is  16.3%.  The  net  present  value \n(NPV) at a 12% discount rate is $14.4 million equivalent. Sensitivity testing has  demonstrated \nthat Project 1 remains viable, with EIRR values above the normally accepted viability threshold \nof 12%, if costs increase by 20% or benefits decrease by 20%. In a worst case test, when costs \nincrease by 20% and benefits decrease by 20%, the EIRR drops to 11.2%. A summary of the \nsensitivity tests carried out is in Table 6.  \n \nA probabilistic risk analysis also has been carried out to assess the combined effects of \n69. \nkey input parameters, including costs, benefits, and traffic growth, on the EIRR and NPV. This \nrisk analysis has provided a more realistic indication of the robustness of the overall EIRR than \nthe  conventional  sensitivity  tests  reported  in  paragraph  68.  It  found  only  a  3%  probability  that \nthe EIRR will be below 12%, and a 95% probability that the EIRR would be greater than 20%. \nFurther details of these analyses are in Supplementary Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Economic Appraisal Sensitivity Tests \n\n \nSensitivity Test \n \nBase case \n \nBenefits reduced by 20% \nInitial construction costs increased by 20%  \nBenefits reduced by 20% and initial construction costs increased by 20% \n \nTraffic growth reduced by 20% \nTraffic growth reduced by 50% \n \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n \n70. \nDespite  the  absence  of  state-road  network  components  with  sufficient  potential  to \ngenerate  toll  or  other  revenues,  Uttaranchal  is  committed  to  funding  the  Investment  Program \n\n \nNPV \n(Rs Million) \n647.9 \n \n211.7 \n297.4 \n(138.7) \n \n408.2 \n104.7 \n \n\n \nEIRR \n(%) \n16.3 \n \n13.5 \n13.7 \n11.2 \n \n14.9 \n12.8 \n \n\nSustainability of Physical Investments  \n\n                                                 \n19  The  generated  traffic  was  estimated  by  adopting  a  price  elasticity  of  demand  of  one  (i.e.,  a  10%  decrease  in \n\ntransport costs would give a 10% increase in traffic).  \n\n20  About 85% of the benefits result from vehicle operating cost savings and 15% from travel time savings. \n21  Assuming that capacity of the light commercial vehicles is shared equally by passengers and freight. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\nThe \n\nto  maintain \n\nSustainability of Nonphysical Investments  \n\ninfrastructure  management  components  would  help  PWD \n\nthrough  additional  budget  allocations  and  external  borrowings,  which  might  come  from \nincreased  revenue  from  the  technology  and  power22 sectors.  Uttaranchal  is  also  committed  to \nproviding adequate funds to maintain the roads after the improvements, which would require a \n5%\u201310% increase in the current funding level23 (when adjusted for inflation). Part of these funds \nare expected to come from vehicle taxes and licensing fees, which have been growing at more \nthan  15%  annually  since  2003.  Moreover,  the  additional  funding  needed  likely  would  decline \nover time with the anticipated reduction of about 10%\u201320% in maintenance costs due to PBCs \nand increased use of multi-axel trucks.24 That would permit the savings to be used for activities \nto increase mobility and accessibility for the rural people.  \n \nC. \n \nthe \n71. \nmomentum  of  the  RDP  and  the  infrastructure  improvement  components  at  a  level  needed  to \nachieve the national and state development goals. The mix of interventions planned under the \ninfrastructure management component in Project 1, which range from staff training to functional \nreorganizations to involvement of road users in planning, will transform the business process of \nPWD.  The  training  program,  in  particular,  is  expected  to  increase  staff  productivity  and  asset \nperformance by providing the skills necessary for efficient execution of the work programs using \ninformation  technology  and  higher  quality  control  systems.  Training  and  awareness  programs \ndesigned  to  increase  civil  works  contractors\u2019  capacity  would  improve  work  quality,  increasing \nthe  life  of  assets.  Integrity  and  transparency  of  the  processes  will  be  enhanced  by  the  use  of \ninformation technology, which will be supported by staff training on MIMPS. \n \nD. \n \n72. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  categorized  as  A,  because  parts  of  two  roads  in  Project  1 \nare  within  environmentally  sensitive  or  protected  areas.  Field  observations  during  the \npreparatory  stage  also  indicated  that  most  roads  in  their  current  condition  damage  the \nenvironment  through  surface  runoff,  earth  slips,  dust,  erosion,  noise,  and  air  pollution.  The \nproposed  improvements  under  the  Investment  Program  will  reduce  several  of  the  sources  of \nsuch  pollutants,  particularly  runoff,  earth  slips,  and  dust.  The  initial  environmental  impact \nexamination  (IEE)  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  have  shown  that  some \ntemporary and reversible negative environmental impacts are likely during construction. These \ninclude  (i)  temporary  reduction  in  water  quality  in  nearby  streams;  (ii)  temporary  increases  in \nparticulate  emissions  and  noise  levels  near  settlements;  and  (iii)  minor  impacts  on  flora  and \nfauna, especially in sections in forests and protected areas. These impacts will be mitigated by \nfully  implementing  the  protective  measures  and  closely  monitoring  construction  works, \naccording to the environmental management plans (EMP). \n \nThe  two  roads  (from  Almora  to  Bageshwar,  and  Barechina  to  Sheraghat)  in  Project  1, \n73. \nparts of which pass through Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, have been operational for more than 40 \nyears.  The  wildlife  sanctuary  was  declared  a  protected  area,  and  ownership  of  the  roads  was \ntransferred  from  PWD  to  the  Forest  Department  in  1988.  The  roads,  which  are  about  25  km \nfrom the main wildlife habitats, connect several communities to the national highway system and \nprovide  access  to  potential  tourist  destinations.  The  improvements  proposed  for  these  two \nroads  will  be  limited  to  the  pavement  and  drainage  facilities  within  the  existing  rights-of-way. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n                                                 \n22  Power generation increased 14% between 2005 and 2006. \n23  About 2.3% of the total annual state capital disbursement. \n24  Resulting from tax incentives offered by the state government. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nfor \n\nimplementing \n\nTherefore,  the  short-term,  construction-related  negative  impacts  will  be  few.  The  EMPs  to \naddress  those  short-term  impacts  have  been  prepared  based  on  the  EIA  studies  of  the  two \nroads. The Ministry of Environment and Forest of India will review and approve the EIA reports \nbefore  the  award  of  works  contracts.  An  IEE  report  encompassing  the  rest  of  the  roads  in \nProject  1  also  has  been  prepared.  The  summary  EIA  report  for  Project  1  and  EARF  were \nsubmitted to the Board and disclosed to public through ADB\u2019s Web site on 17 July 2006. \n \n74. \nIn  each  subsequent  project  of  the  Investment  Program,  PWD  will  try  to  contain  the \nimprovements  within  the  existing  rights-of-way,  and  conduct  environmental  assessments  of \neach road to be improved in that project. An EIA, including an EMP, will be prepared for each \nroad categorized as A according to ADB guidelines; and a summary EIA will be prepared and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review.  To  avoid  short-term  impacts  of  the  road  improvement  works  on \nwildlife  sanctuaries  and  forested  areas,  asphalt  mixing  plants,  crusher  plants,  construction \ncamps,  and  disposal  of  construction  material  will  not  be  permitted  within  such  areas.  The \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  work  closely  with  the  Sanctuary  Wardens  and  Forest \nConservators of the relevant areas. PWD will be responsible for implementing the EMPs, while \nthe  mitigation  measures  during \nthe  contractors  will  be  responsible \nconstruction.  \n \n75. \nFor  roads  categorized  other  than  A,  PWD  will  prepare  an  IEE  report  and  a \ncorresponding EMP. The environmental assessments required for environmental categorization, \nreview and approval procedures, as well as the responsibilities of ADB and PWD, are described \nin EARF. For village roads and light vehicle roads, an IEE checklist and a standard EMP will be \nemployed.25 To comply with national requirements, PWD will obtain the necessary permits from \nthe relevant agencies before handing over the construction sites. All environmental reports and \nEMPs will be prepared according to the relevant national and state laws and regulations, as well \nas ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EARF. \n \nE. \n \n76. \nThe  Planning  Commission  of  Uttaranchal  has  estimated  that  more  than  35%  of  the \npeople in the state live in poverty. The population in the Investment Program catchment areas \nconsists largely of rural people (75%), who are mostly farmers and unskilled laborers. A social \nassessment along the roads to be improved in Project 1 found that 4%\u201311% of the households \nare involved in businesses, while 19%\u201335% of the households are engaged in agriculture. Each \nday,  women  on  average  spend  4  hours  on  household  activities  and  5  hours  on  agricultural \nactivities. An average person travels 3\u20136 km to access health facilities. In most of the districts, \nthe surveys found that people walk 6\u20137 km to the nearest bus stop or local transport services. \nLocal  transport  is  infrequent\u2014in  most  cases,  SRTC  services  are  provided  only  once  per  day. \nHence, people resort to other forms of local transport services. In cases of emergency, people \ndepend  on  private  transport  services  for  which  they  pay  higher  charges.  The  roads  to  be \nimproved  under  the  Investment  Program  are  spread  across  all  13  districts,  and  will  be \naccessible  to  about  3.5  million  people  living  in  adjacent  villages.  The  improved  roads  are \nexpected  to  increase  service  frequencies  and  enable  more  through  services  to  a  wider  set  of \ndestinations. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts  \n\n                                                 \n25  The  IEE  checklist  and  standard  EMP  served  as  the  IEE  for  the  rural  road  projects  under  the  components  of \n\nPMSGY funded by ADB.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n\nImpact on Indigenous Peoples  \n\nInvestment Program Beneficiaries  \n\nF. \n \n77. \nIn  addition  to  the  benefits  to  the  rural  people  from  increased  access  to  markets  and \nsocial  services,  the  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  create  business  and  employment \nopportunities in the state. Approximately 80 contract packages, each valued between $8 million \nand  $10  million,  will  be  awarded  for  physical  works  over  7  years.  The  larger  contracts  would \ncreate opportunities for existing contractors to expand and invest in new construction equipment, \nand  new  contractors  to  enter  the  market.  Expansion  of  the  construction  industry  would  create \ndirect, permanent employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. Project 1 will require \nabout 0.8 million person-days of input from unskilled workers, and the Investment Program will \nrequire about 15.2 million person-days of input.  \n \nG. \n \n78. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  not  hinder  or  negatively  impact  any  segment  of  the \npopulation based on ethnic origin. It will generate equal benefits to all persons in the influence \narea of the Investment Program and the region. The improvement to the roads and connectivity \nwill  encourage  better  transport  services,  thereby  improving  access  for  all  people,  to  social \nservices, higher levels of schooling, health facilities, etc.  \n \nNo scheduled tribe households will be adversely affected by Project 1. The Indigenous \n79. \nPeople  Development  Framework  (IPDF)  in  Supplementary  Appendix  7  was  prepared  in  case \nindigenous people issues arise in the  subsequent  projects  of  the  Investment  Program.  If  such \nissues  arise  in  any  subsequent  project,  an  IPDP  will  have  to  be  prepared  for  each  road,  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). This will have to be submitted \nto ADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \nH. \n \n80. \nFour of the 23 roads that will be improved in Project 1 will have resettlement impacts. A \ndetailed census has been conducted along those four roads, and short resettlement plans have \nbeen  prepared  for  each  section.  No  private  land  acquisition  will  be  required.  However,  the \nstructures  of  17  encroacher  and  squatter  households  (totaling  87  affected  persons)  will  be \npartially  damaged,  including  boundary  walls  and  parts  of  buildings.  Six  of  those  17  structures \nare residential, commercial, or residential-cum-commercial. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy On \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the  resettlement  framework,  if  future  projects  of  the \nInvestment  Program  entail  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  a  resettlement  plan  for \neach  impacting  road  will  have  to  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before \ncontracts are awarded. PWD has disclosed the short resettlement plans for the four impacting \nroads  in  Project  1  to  the  affected  persons.  A  summary  of  the  short  resettlement  plans  is  in \nAppendix 10.  \n \nI. \n \nThe  main  risk  to  success  of  the  Investment  Program  is  likely  to  stem  from  project \n81. \npreparation  delays,  implementation  delays,  and  the  quality  of  physical  outputs.  Project \npreparation delays might lead to delays in the submission of PFRs, and subsequent delays in \nthe  Investment  Program  implementation.  To  minimize  this  risk,  ADB  has  reviewed  all  steps  in \nproject  preparation  in  detail  with  PWD,  and  has  agreed  on  a  feasible  schedule  for  PFR \nsubmissions. Another potential cause of procurement delays will be mitigated in the Investment \n\nResettlement Impacts  \n\nRisks  \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nProgram by appropriately grouping and spacing the calls for bids. The projects also have been \nsized and sequenced to allow PWD\u2019s capacity to be enhanced incrementally.  \n \n82. \nEvidence  from  recent  road  development  programs  in  India,  particularly  NHDP  and \nPMGSY, suggest that implementation delays in many cases are related to (i) land acquisition; \n(ii)  cumbersome  environmental,  forest,  and  railway  clearance  procedures;  (iii)  procurement \ndocument  preparation;  (iv)  inadequate  procurement  planning;  and  (v)  complexities  of  bid \nevaluation.  Poor  quality  of  physical  outputs  has  been  found  to  be  a  function  of  executing \nagencies\u2019  lack  of  experience  with  contract  administration  and  contracting.  To  minimize  these \nrisks  in  the  Investment  Program,  PWD\u2019s  consultants  and  later  its  trained  staff  will  prepare \nadvance plans for each project, identifying the critical paths and necessary advance contracting. \nAdequate  resources  are  provided  for  consulting  services  for  supervision  of  works,  and \nresources are allocated from the infrastructure management component in Project 1 for training \nPWD\u2019s  staff  in  contract  administration.  Additionally,  the  PBCs  are  expected  to  expand  the \ncontractor  pool  due  to  the  increased  size  of  the  contract  packages  and  the  potential  for \nextended work.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n83. \nADB will seek the following broad assurances, in addition to the assurances consistent \nwith  its  policies  applicable  to  all  projects  and  all  borrowers,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents: \n \nA. \n \n84. \n \n\nUttaranchal will \n\nGeneral \n\nprovide  its  share  of  funding  for  the  Investment  Program  in  accordance  with  the \nFinancing Plan and the implementation schedule, as well as provide for any cost \noverruns in excess of the contingencies; and   \nprovide the funding needed for maintaining the network roads in a good condition \nduring and after the completion of the Investment Program. \n\nEnvironment  \n\nUttaranchal through PWD will \n\nimplement EARF in every project in the Investment Program in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  India \nand Uttaranchal; and   \nprovide  training  for  engineers  to  be  assigned  to  projects  for  environmental \nmanagement,  and  to  ensure  that  PWD\u2019s  responsibilities  as  described  in  EARF \nare  fully  implemented  in  consultation  with  the  contractor  and  construction \nsupervision consultants.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nB. \n \n85. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n\nC. \n \n86. \n\n \nD. \n \n87. \n\n(ii) \n\n(ii) \n\nExecution of Civil Works Contracts \n\nUttaranchal through PWD will, \n \n(i) \n\nsubject  to  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  RF,  IPDF,  and  EARF  (a) \nmake  available  land  and  rights  to  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances;  and  (b) \nclear  the  utilities,  trees,  and  any  other  obstruction  from  such  land,  on  a  timely \nbasis,  i.e.,  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  as  agreed  under  the  related \nworks contract, as required for activities relating to each road or section of a road \nincluded in the works contract; and \nsubsequent to the award of a contract package to a contractor in any project in \nthe  Investment  Program,  ensure  that  roads  or  sections  of  roads  (sites)  in  that \npackage are not handed over to the contractor unless all applicable provisions of \nthe RF, IPDF, and EARF are satisfied.  \n\nSocial Impacts and Other Issues \n\nUttaranchal through PWD will \n \n(i) \n\nimplement all projects in the Investment Program in accordance with the RF and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Indigenous  Peoples \nPolicy (1998), and applicable national and state laws and regulations;  \nif there are any design changes in Project 1 roads, ensure that the short RPs are \nupdated on the basis of the final alignment and submitted to ADB for review and \napproval prior to awarding of civil works contracts. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n  \nE. \n \nPWD will ensure that the works contractors under the project(s) incorporate provisions to \n88. \nthe effect that the contractor will (i) carry out HIV/AIDs awareness and prevention programs for \nlabor; (ii) not employ or use children as labor; (iii) disseminate information at worksites on risks \nof sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDs as part of health and safety measures for those \nemployed  during  construction;  and  (iv)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe  civil  works  contract  will  also  provide  for  termination  of  the  contract  by  PWD  in  case  of \nbreach of any of the stated provisions by the contractors. \n \nF. \n \n89. \nUttaranchal will ensure strict adherence of contractors to national and state road safety \nstandards in terms of signage, road markings, roadside structures, and maintenance. As part of \nthe midterm review of the Investment Program, Uttaranchal and ADB will conduct a road safety \naudit and, if necessary, implement any measures needed to revise the institutional mechanisms, \nfinancing modalities, and detailed implementing arrangements to improve safety. \n \n\nRoad Safety \n\n\f23\n\nSelection and Approval Process for Project Roads  \n\nG. \n \n90. \nPWD will ensure that selection of roads to be improved in each project of the Investment \nProgram  is  based  on  the  procedures  and  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  4,  and  will  be  in \naccordance  with  the  RDP.  The  request  for  approval  of  each  project  will  follow  the  stages \ndescribed in Appendix 4 and the FFA. \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nUttaranchal through PWD will   \n\nensure  that  the  steering  committee  set  up  to  monitor  and  guide  the  Investment \nProgram  will  remain  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  Facility,  and  will  oversee  the \nimplementation of all projects to ensure timely and successful completion; \nensure  that  the  PMU  set  up  for  Project  1  shall  remain  adequately  staffed  and \nfunctional  during  the  implementation  of  subsequent  projects  in  the  Investment \nProgram and provide, as necessary, counterpart staff;   \nwithin  2  months  of  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan,  engage  program  support \nconsultants  financed  by  the  first  loan,  to  assist  the  PMU  to  coordinate  and \nfacilitate  processing  and  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  activities, \nand liaise with the consultants in different projects;   \nat least 1 month prior to the award of the first works contract under each project \nor  no  more  than  1  month  from  the  date  of  effectiveness  of  the  loan  for  each \nproject,  whichever  comes  first,  establish  an  adequate  number  of  PIUs  to \nadminister the works contracts in each project; \nensure that the composition of the Steering Committee and the PMU staff agreed \nwith  ADB  remains  fixed  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  Investment  Program,  and \nthe composition of the staff of the PIU(s) set up for a particular project will remain \nfixed for the entire duration of that project; \nensure  that  necessary  authority  is  delegated  to  the  appropriate  PMU  staff  for \ntimely  processing  of  PFRs  and  implementation  of  individual  projects  to \ncoordinate with ADB for strict adherence to implementation schedules including, \nbut  not  limited  to,  recruitment  of  consultants  and  safeguard  compliances,  as \nagreed under the Facility as well as for individual projects; and \nprovide  adequate  funding  for  independent  monitoring  of  safeguard  activities  in \nthe projects under the various frameworks. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Reporting \n\nUttaranchal will  \n\nensure  that  PWD,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  develops  within  3  months  of  the \napproval  of  the  Facility  an  investment  program  performance  monitoring  system.  \nSimilarly within 3 months of the effective date of each Loan Agreement, PWD will \ndevelop  a  project  performance  monitoring  system.

Both departments have a state cabinet minister. PWD is \nresponsible  for  planning,  financing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  roads,  bridges,  and \ngovernment  buildings.  Uttaranchal\u2019s  Transport  Department  is  the  remit  of  Uttar  Pradesh\u2019s \nTransport Department, which was constituted in 1945 under the provisions of Section 133 A of \nthe  Motor  Vehicles'  Act  1939,  and  is  headed  by  a  commissioner.  Transport  Department  is \nresponsible for issuing licenses for vehicles and operators, operating permits for private freight \nand passenger service operators, and managing the State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC). \n\n2. \n\nTransport Services \n\n2. \nApproximately 90% of passenger and freight traffic in the state moves by road. Further, \nmore than 80% of the freight and passenger traffic and heavy vehicles use national highways, \nwhich account for less than 7% of the road network.1 Rail services offer freight and passenger \nconnections to the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh and to New Delhi through four rail heads \nin Uttaranchal\u2019s southern low-lying plain region.2 The hilly and mountainous terrain that covers \nmore  than  90%  of  state\u2019s  land  area  would  preclude  the  development  of  railway  infrastructure \ncatering to intrastate services. Although an air service operates once a day between the state \ncapital Dehradun and New Delhi, its capacity is limited and its reliability is poor.   \n \nSRTC  operates  inter-  and  intrastate  passenger  services  on  35  nationalized  routes \n3. \n(mostly  national  highways,  state  highways,  and  district  roads),  and  on  many  non-nationalized \n(routes of other classes of roads). However, private operators provide the bulk of the freight and \npassenger services under permits issued by state transport authorities. These private operators \nare  responsive  to  customer  demand,  and  are  not  constrained  by  fixed  schedules.  The  private \npassenger and freight transport operators have formed independent unions and associations to \nsafeguard their interests and lobby the state government for concessions.   \n \nSRTC  has  a  fleet  of  968  buses  operating  out  of  15  depots  across  the  state.3  In  2005, \n4. \nSRTC\u2019s  vehicle  utilization  averaged  288  kilometers  (km)  per  day  at  an  average  occupancy  of \n63%.  Gross  income  from  operations  during  the  same  period  was  approximately  $28.5  million, \nand monthly income increased by 27% during the year. SRTC has embarked on a program to \nreplace the aging bus fleet it inherited from Uttar Pradesh, with the replacement of the full fleet \nplanned by the end of 2007. Although SRTC\u2019s bus operations are well used and show healthy \ngrowth, they focus on connecting the main population centers throughout the state, as well as \nserving Delhi and other important cities in neighboring Uttar Pradesh. \n \n5. \nPrivately  operated  passenger  transport  predominates  in  the  rural  hill  areas.  These \nservices often serve the smaller villages off the main routes between towns, providing a more \n\n                                                 \n1   Source: Strategic Options Study.

In the hill areas, the private passenger services are provided \nby jeeps that are frequently grossly overloaded with passengers. Operators of these jeeps set \ntheir own fares, within maximum and minimum limits prescribed by SRTC. The state does not \nexercise control over freight tariffs, which are purely market-driven.   \n \n\n  \n\n3. \n\nVehicle Fleet  \n\n6. \nUttaranchal\u2019s vehicle fleet has been growing steadily over the past 5 years. Since 2001, \nvehicle registration data shows consistent annual growth rates of 12%\u201314%, with the number of \nregistered  vehicles  reaching  565,700  in  March  2005.  Of  these  vehicles,  some  77%  are  two-\nwheelers  and  10%  are  cars.  Commercial  vehicles  (buses,  trucks,  vans,  etc.)  account  for  only \n13%  of  registered  vehicles.  Although  the  high  growth  rates  suggest  a  buoyant  vehicle  fleet, \nthese statistics tend to represent conditions in the plains and in the main urban centers where \npopulation  densities  are  higher.  They  do  not  reflect  the  general  conditions  in  the  hill  areas, \nwhere  incomes  and  population  densities  are  lower.  Overall,  average  vehicle  ownership  in  the \nstate is about 30% lower than the national average. \n   \n\n4. \n\nRoad Network \n\nThe  road  network  administered  by  PWD  comprises  of  national  highways  (NH),4  state \n7. \nhighways (SH), major district roads (MDR), other district roads (ODR), village roads (VR), light \nvehicle  roads  (LVR),  and  footpaths.  Approximately  16,800  km  of  that  network  are  motorable \nroads.  The  Border  Roads  Organization  manages  about  1,200  km  of  NHs,  SHs,  MDRs,  and \nODRs; while local authorities and other state departments manage approximately 8,100 km of \nlower category roads.   \n \n8. \nOnly 103 km of roads in the network are two-lane with a carriageway width of 7.0 meters \nor  more.5  The  rest  are  single-lane  roads  with  carriageway  widths  of  3.75  meters  or  less.6  In \ntotal,  62%  of  roads  are  bitumen  or  concrete  surfaced.  Table  A2.1  shows  the  proportions  of \nsurfaced and un-surfaced roads for the various road categories.   \n \n\nTable A2.1:  Surface Types of PWD Network in Financial Year 2004 \n\nRoad Category \n\nState Highways \n\nMajor District Roads  \n\nOther District Road  \n\nVillage Roads  \n\nLight Vehicle Roads   \n\nNetwork Roads (%) \n\nSurfaced  \n\nUnsurfaced  \n\n100 \n\n99 \n\n66 \n\n69 \n\n10 \n\n62 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n34 \n\n31 \n\n90 \n\n38 \n\nTotal PWD Road Network  \n\n PWD = Public Works Department.  \n Source: Road Development Plan (November 2005). \n\n                                                 \n4   NHs fall under the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which has delegated maintenance responsibility to \n\nPWD. \n\n5   This excludes the 455 km of NHs with more than two lanes.  \n6   PWD. 2005.

More  than  80%  of  the  collector  and  distributor  roads  (ODRs  and  VRs9),  which \naccount for about 65% of PWD\u2019s network, needs to be repaired or rehabilitated. Consequently, \npoor  network  connectivity  and  restrictions  on  formal  transport  services  to  the  main  arterials \nincrease the cost of transport for people and enterprises. On the roads that are in good and fair \ncondition, geometric deficiencies, lack of signs and delineation, and temporary closures due to \nearth  slips  and  rock  falls  constrain  capacity.  Continuation  of  this  phenomenon  has  deprived  a \nlarge part of the population of access to basic services and opportunities to maintain or enhance \nincomes and quality of life during winter and rainy seasons. \n    \n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Surface Condition of PWD Roads by Category in Financial Year 2004 \n\nRoad Category \n\nState Highways  \n\nMajor District Roads  \n\nOther District Road  \n\nVillage Roads  \n\nLight Vehicle Roads   \n\nTotal PWD Road Network  \n\nCondition Rating (% of length) \n\nGood  \n\nFair  \n\nPoor  \n\nTotal \n\n32 \n\n19 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n1 \n\n12 \n\n46 \n\n75 \n\n48 \n\n45 \n\n23 \n\n45 \n\n22 \n\n6 \n\n40 \n\n42 \n\n76 \n\n43 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\nPWD = Public Works Department. \nSource: PWD\u2019s Road Condition Study 2004\u20132005. \n \n10. \nTraffic  on  SHs,  MDRs,  and  ODRs  in  the  hilly  parts  of  the  state  reportedly  average \naround  500,  300,  and  150  vehicles  per  day,  respectively.  The  Strategic  Options  Study \nconducted  by  the  PWD  found  that  only  three  roads,  totaling  150  km,  would  warrant  widening \nbased on traffic volume. Traffic generation rates in the scarcely populated hilly areas, which are \nserved  by  the  state  roads,  have  remained  low  mostly  due  to  the  poor  surface  condition, \nconstraining  geometry,  and  seasonality  of  the  roads.  Most  of  the  traffic  on  the  state-road \nnetwork is small multipurpose vehicles (jeeps) and non-motorized vehicles.  \n \n11. \nA summary of the network and its geographic dispersion is in Table A2.3. The roads are \ndispersed throughout all 13 districts of the state. While the road density per capita is highest in \nthe  hilly  region,  the  density  per  area  drops  substantially.  The  majority  of  those  roads  are  the \nleast maintained and repaired ODRs and VRs, which is the origin of poor connectivity.   \n \nLocal contractors carry out periodic maintenance using mostly labor-intensive, outdated, \n12. \nand  inefficient  construction  methods.  Small  local  contractors  also  undertake  the  capital  works. \nThe practice of awarding many small contracts valued at around $1.0 million each provides no \nincentive  for  those  small  contractors  to  invest  in  modern  construction  plant,  raise  production \nrates,  and  improve  quality.  In  FY2005,  47  contracts  were  awarded,  with  the  largest  being  the \nequivalent  of  about  $1.2  million  for  the  rehabilitation  of  about  25  km.  Although  PWD  has \nprequalified  65  grade  A  private  contractors  to  undertake  works  valued  at  equivalent  of  about \n                                                 \n7  The total length of SHs is 696 km. PWD is responsible 437 km, while the Border Roads Organization is responsible \n\nfor the rest.  \n\n8   Totaling about 1,370 km. \n9   Totaling about 12,200 km. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n$100,000, only about two in-state contractors reportedly are likely to qualify for works valued at \n$10 million. \n \n13. \nLocal contractors carry out the majority of routine road maintenance operations, albeit in \nsmall contracts. PWD still has its own labor workforce of about 5,000, which it tends to use in \nthe  hilly  remote  areas.  However,  a  moratorium  has  been  placed  on  hiring  new  maintenance \nlabor to reduce the workforce through attrition, which would allow even the routine maintenance \nto  be  outsourced  to  the  private  sector.  Under  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY), \ncontractors carry out road maintenance according to agreed performance standards for 5 years \nafter  completion  of  construction.  Use  of  performance-based  contracts  (PBC)  has  been \nincreasing in India. PWD intends to adopt this method of contracting for area-wide maintenance. \nThis is a positive development that is expected to increase cost efficiency and effectiveness of \nroad maintenance operations. \n \nB. \n\nPlanning and Financing  \n\nInvestment in roads is based on annual construction and maintenance budgets prepared \n14. \nby the divisional offices of the PWD. The annual budgets include the estimated cost of capital \nworks (new roads and periodic maintenance) and routine maintenance costs. However, works \nare  not  prioritized  and  programmed  according  to  state  or  local  goals.  These  budgets  are \nsubmitted  to  PWD  headquarters  for  review.  Based  on  those  submissions,  a  budget  request  is \nmade to the state, which then appropriates the full amount or part of the funds requested to the \nPWD. Those funds then are allocated to the various divisions in proportion to their requests and \nother considerations. \n \n15. \nState  sources  include  (i)  direct  revenue  earned  through  road  tax,  (ii)  license  fees,  (iii) \nfreight  operator\u2019s  licenses,  and  (iv)  passenger  transport  operator\u2019s  licenses.  The  transport  tax \nrevenue goes into the state government\u2019s reserves, and is not dedicated for road development. \nThis  revenue  amounted  to  $21.9  million  in  FY2004,  which  was  around  20%  of  the  total \nexpenditure budget for that year. The remainder was from direct budget allocations. In FY2006, \nthe  state\u2019s contribution was  approximately  83%,  with  the  national  sources  making up  the  rest. \nTable A2.410 shows an increasing trend in financing for road infrastructure since FY2002, and a \nlarger portion being allocated to maintenance. Revenues from vehicle taxes and licenses have \nbeen  increasing  at  an  average  annual  rate  of around  15%.

As  part  of  the  strategy  for \nimproving overall transport sector performance, India has initiated a balanced program of road \nsubsector development under the 10th Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007), which will continue under \nthe  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (2008\u20132012).  The  program  aims  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  road \nnetwork, as well as improve (i) maintenance of rural roads, (ii) road safety, (iii) riding quality of \nnational  highways,  (iv)  rural  connectivity  with  all-weather  roads,  and  (v)  access  to  intermodal \nterminals.  The  two  main  components  of  that  program  are  the  National  Highway  Development \nProgram (NHDP),11 and PMGSY Program.12  \n \n17. \nThe  state  government\u2019s  vision,  as  outlined  by  the  chief  minister  in  2005,  is  to  reach  a \nlevel  of  economic  development  that  would  generate  employment  and  income  opportunities  for \nits people to achieve a good quality of life and social progress, while preserving the environment \nand nature. Towards this end, the state government has announced an infrastructure plan to (i) \ndouble per capita income, (ii) halve the population living in poverty, (iii) arrest the migration of \nworkers,  and  (iv)  provide  universal  access  to  electricity  and  safe  drinking  water.  The  plan \nenvisages  investments  in  key  components  of  the  state\u2019s  infrastructure  system  to  stimulate \nagriculture, industry, and service industries; and create employment opportunities.   \n \n18.  \nThe  vision  for  road  infrastructure,  as  described  by  the  state,  is  \u201crapid  and  social \nupliftment of the population while simultaneously ensuring balanced regional development and \nspreading  the  accruing  benefits  evenly  over  all  sections  of  the  society\u201d.  To  realize  this  vision, \nUttaranchal formulated a draft road policy in 2005 with the objective of creating a road network \nthat  would  provide  (i)  high-speed  connectivity  with  the  rest  of  the  country,  (ii)  adequate  and \nefficient  connectivity  to  all  the  demand  drivers  (tourism,  industries,  agriculture,  and  urban \ncenters), (iii) connectivity to all villages and habitations through roads and bridges, and (v) year-\nround service. The relevant state ministries are reviewing the draft road policy. \n \nThe  draft  road  policy  will  be  implemented  through  the  road  development  plan  (RDP) \n19. \nprepared  by  PWD  in  2005.  The  RDP  outlines  a  program  of  physical  improvements, \n\n                                                 \n11  Announced in 1998, NHDP was intended to upgrade 13,146 km to multi-lane standards between 2001 and 2007. It \nwas  expanded  in  February  2005  to  seven  phases.  Phases  III  through  VII  are  intended  to  upgrade  an  additional \n45,000 km, and add a 1,000 km of new expressways between 2005 and 2012. \n\n12  Initiated  in  2000  with  the  aim  of  providing  all-weather  access  from  main  thoroughfares  to  rural  settlements  with \n\nmore than 250 people by constructing and improving the previously used foot paths and village roads.   \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nmaintenance strategies, and skills development measures designed to (i) surface all unsurfaced \nnetwork  roads,  (ii)  upgrade  all  safety  features  on  roads  to  meet  Indian  Roads  Congress \nstandards,  (iii)  provide  road  links  to  all  social  facilities  that  are  more  than  1.5  km  from  any \nhabitation, (iv) provide road links to all tourist centers and 60%\u201370% of pilgrimage centers, (v) \nmaintain 85% of the network roads in good condition after 2015, (vi) outsource all maintenance \nworks on a competitive basis under PBCs, and (vii) provide training in key areas to PWD staff. \n \n \n20.   Physical improvements have been programmed in the RDP using a multi-criteria ranking \nsystem,  which  takes  into  account  the  remaining  life  and  economic  importance  (population \ndensity  and  connectivity)  of  the  road  section.13  The  program  is  divided  into  three  stages,  as \nshown  in  Table  A2.5.  Staging  has  been  determined  largely  on  the  basis  of  the  rankings. \nAccordingly,  344  road  sections  have  been  assigned  to  Stage  I.  These  sections  must  be \nimproved within the next 3 years, because they are (i) scheduled for improvement, or (ii) needed \nto  link  the  federally  funded  rural  road  and  NHDP.  The  roads  included  in  Stage  II  have  less \nurgency.  Road  sections  assigned  to  Stage  III  are  both  less  urgent  and  less  than  5  km  long. \nStage  III  would  cover  all  secondary  and  tertiary  roads,  as  well  as  the  balance  of  roads  in  the \nnetwork that recently have had (or will soon have) periodic maintenance treatment, and would \nrequire more extensive interventions in the later years of the program.   \n \n\nTable A2.5: Stages of Road Development Plan \n\nRoad Improvements \n\nStage \n\nPeriod \n\nI \nII \nIII \n Total \n\n2007\u20132010 \n2011\u20132014 \n2015\u20132017 \n \n\nLength \n(km) \n5,650 \n5,150 \n6,180 \n16,980 \n\nRoads \n(#) \n344 \n334 \nto be determined \n \n\nCost  \n($ million)a\n352 \n262 \n346 \n960 \n\nkm = kilometers \na In 2005 prices.

For Stage 1, the 344 roads (or \nsections  of  roads)  have  been  grouped  into  four  projects  (Projects  1  through  4),  as  shown  in \nTable  A2.6.  Pre-construction  work  on  roads  in  Project  1  has  been  completed,  and  pre-\nconstruction work for Project 2 is expected to start in mid-2006.   \n \n\nTable A2.6: Projects in Stage I of Road Development Plan \n\nActivity \n\nLength  \n(km) \n\nRoads \n(#) \n23 \n49 \n114 \n158 \n344 \n\nProject 1 \nProject 2 \nProject 3 \nProject 4 \nTotal  \n \nkm = kilometers \na In 2005 prices. \nSource: Road Development Plan (November 2005). \n\n573 \n1,270 \n1,847 \n1,960 \n   5,650 \n\nCost  \n($ million) \n58 \n75 \n110 \n110 \n352 \n\nImplementation \nPeriod \n2007\u20132008 \n2007\u20132009 \n2008\u20132009 \n2009\u20132010 \n2007\u20132010 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4.   \n\n                                                 \n13  As estimated during PWD\u2019s road condition survey (2004\u20132005). The full list of criteria employed for ranking is   in \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAs  shown  in  Table  A2.5,  the  program  of  physical  improvements  and  maintenance \n22. \nrequires approximately $960 million,14 which would amount to about $120 million per year in real \nterms  over  the  next  10  years.  Based  on  the  state\u2019s  budget  allocation  to  PWD  in  FY2006  of \nabout $150 million, as shown in Table A2.4, the program would require approximately an 80% \nincrease  in  annual  funding.  The  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  from  ADB  is \nintended  to  help  finance  part  of  the  investments  under  the  RDP.  An  MFF  is  best  suited  to \nsupport  planned  sequential  investments,  which  progressively  would  elevate  percentage  of  the \nstate roads in good condition to 90%. The Investment Plan under the MFF and the investment \nroad map are in Table A2.7. These investments will be in parallel, and in addition to, the PWD\u2019s \nother road development and maintenance programs.    \n \n23. \nTo enhance the sustainability of the impact of this large investment, PWD intends to cut \ncosts and improve maintenance by procuring civil and maintenance works under PBCs. Indirect \nbenefits  of  PBCs  include  increased  opportunities  for  private  sector  involvement,  and  fewer \nopportunities for misappropriation of funds. The lower costs would be derived from economies \nof  scale  and  reduced  prices  in  return  for  long-term  work  assurances  for  contractors.  PBCs, \nwhich are generally larger and longer than conventional construction contracts, help contractors \ndistribute  overhead,  and  generate  incentives  to  enhance  construction  quality  to  lower \nsubsequent  maintenance  costs.  This  would  encourage  private  road  builders  in  the  state  to \nconsolidate or expand, and be more professional and innovative. PWD, on the other hand, can \nreduce  the  number  of  contracts  and  variation  orders,  thereby  reducing  opportunities  for \nmisrepresentation of work and ex-gratia payments for expeditious processing. Under PBCs, the \ncontractors will be delegated the responsibility of managing and maintaining specific segments \nof roads, or part of a network, at predefined minimum levels of serviceability. Payments will be \nperiodic  lump  sums,  conditional  on  maintaining  the  road  at  the  established  serviceability  or \nperformance standards. PWD also can use the assurances to leverage a lower price and focus \nmore on monitoring, instead of devoting time to procurement.  \n \nCombined  type  PBCs  would  be  awarded  initially  in  projects  financed  from  the  MFF, \n24. \nwhich  will  be  mainstreamed  into  PWD's  standard  procurement  policy  over  the  duration  of  the \nMFF. To allow time for preparation, the first set of PBCs is scheduled to be awarded in Project \n2, as shown in Table A2.7. Subsequently, area-wide maintenance works will be awarded under \nPBCs.  \n\n                                                \n \n14  Approximately $1.2 billion when adjusted for inflation. \n\n\fTable A2.7: Road Map and Investment Program \n \n \n2009\n \n\n \n2012\n \n\n \n2011\n \n\n \n2010\n \n\n \n2008\n \n\n2007\n \n \n\n2013\n \n\n \n2014\n \n\n \n2015\n \n\n \n2016\n \n\n \n2017\n \n\n \n\n \nTotal\n \n\n60\n \n\n60\n \n\n \n\n \n30\n90\n \n \n\n \n\n \n30\n90\n \n \n\n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n30\n140\n \n \n\nP5\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n35\n145\n \n \n\nP6\n \n\n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n35\n145\n \n \n\nP7\n \n\n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n35\n145\n \n \n \n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n40\n150\n \n \n \n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n40\n \n150\n \n \n \n \n\n60\n \n\n50\n \n\n \n45\n145\n \n \n \n \n\n60\n \n\n40\n \n\n \n45\n105\n \n \n \n \n\n \nP1\n\nP2\n \n\nP3\n \n\nP4\n \n\n  Length of Village Roads Improved \n\n60\n \n\n90\n \n\n650\n \n\n750\n \n\n100\n \n\nItem \nRoad Development Plan \n  Capital Investment \u2013 New Roads  \n \n  Capital Investment \u2013 Improvement of \n\n($ million) \n\nExisting Roads (millions) \n\n  Maintenance ($ million)\n \n  Total Funding Requirements ($ million)\n \n \nInvestment Program \nA.

PWD is headed by chief engineer I, \nwho  reports  to  the  PWD  secretary  appointed  by  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  India.  The \nsecretary  is  assisted  by  an  additional  secretary  of  PWD,  also  appointed  by  India;  and  a  joint \nsecretary  appointed  by  the  state  Public  Service  Commission.  The  secretaries  are  responsible \nfor  establishing  the  policy  framework  and  monitoring  organizational  performance.  The  current \norganization chart is in Figure 3.1, showing the reporting lines and other senior staff positions. \n \n\nFigure A3.1: Current Organizational Structure of PWD \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nPWD Minister\n\nSE \nNational Highways \n\nSE \nCircle (5) \n\nFinance \nController\n\nEngineer-in-Chief \u2013 Level 1\n\nChief Engineer \nKumaun \n\nChief Engineer \nPauri \n\nSenior Staff Officer \nOperations \n\nSenior State Officer \nEstablishment\n\nSecretary \u2013 Additional Secretary \u2013 Joint Secretary\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations: PWD = Public Works Department; SE = superintendent engineer. \n \n2. \nFor planning, budgeting, and executing work programs, the state is divided into two main \nPWD operational zones headed by a chief engineer. The zones are divided into circles headed \nby  superintending  engineers,  divisions  headed  by  executive  engineers,  and  areas  headed  by \nassistant engineers. Each AE is supported by three to four junior engineers. In total, PWD has \n9,383  employees:  895  engineers;  2,061  administrative  staff;  1,425  field  staff,  including  skilled \nlaborers  and  drivers;  and  5,000  maintenance  workers.  The  maintenance  workers  are  being \nphased  out  though  a  hiring  freeze.  Staff  cost  has  decreased  as  a  percentage  of  the \nadministrative budget from 25% in FY2003 to the current estimate of 16% in FY2005, which is \nconsiderably less than the national average. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nClearance Procedures. More than 50% of the PWD road network passes through forest \nareas. As such, PWD must obtain clearances from the state Department of Forests (DOF) for \n\nSE  \nElectrical \nMechanical \n\nSE \nElectrical \nMechanical \n\nProcedural Deficiencies \n\nSE \nCircle (4)\n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\nany major repairs or rehabilitation work on those roads. Clearances for up to 5 hectares of land \nare  issued  through  its  district  offices.  However,  given  the  average  10-meter  rights-of-way \n(ROW)  of  most  roads,  the  maximum  length  of  a  road  that  a  district  DOF  office  can  clear  is  5 \nkilometers (km). Clearances for longer stretches must be obtained from higher authorities of the \nstate or central governments, which is often time consuming. In a state where the construction \nseason is short,1 those delays have had undermined productivity significantly.  \n \n4. \nExcessive Travel Times. The hilly terrain that characterizes the state limits speeds to \n25\u201330  km  per  hour  on most  roads.  As  a  result,  traveling  from  each  of  the  two  zone  offices to \nmany  of  the  respective  divisions  takes  1  day,  and  to  the  circles  requires  half  a  day.  That \nreduces the time available for supervision and monitoring of works by PWD staff.   \n \nExcessive  Consultation.  Another  factor2  that  affects  effective  supervision  and \n5. \nmonitoring  time  is  the  many  state-level  meetings  between  headquarters  staff  and  chief \nengineers;  and  zone-level  meetings  between  the  superintending  engineers  and  the  executive \nengineers. Reportedly, an average of 10\u201320 days a month are spent attending meetings, which \nmostly address one outstanding issue and are often do not produce a result.  \n \n6. \nArchaic Manuals. PWD\u2019s procedures still contain remnants of the system set up in the \nmid-1850s,  and  are  guided  by  manuals  from  Uttar  Pradesh.  For  instance,  the  outline  of  the \nbasic organizational structure and job descriptions stem from the Financial Handbook, Volume \nVI  that  the  government  of  Uttar  Pradesh  issued  in  1974.  Likewise,  maintenance  methods  are \nbased  on  the  Maintenance  Manual  for  Roads  issued  by  the  PWD  of  Uttar  Pradesh  in  1984. \nWhile  supplementary  manuals  and  guidelines  have  been  issued  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  an \nintegrated updated manual has not been produced.  \n \n7. \nInadequate Planning. Planning is limited to preparation of budget proposals for the next \nfiscal year, largely in isolation from state development goals and stakeholder views. Proposals \nare  based  on  quantities  from  project  lists  submitted  by  the  districts  and  inflation-adjusted  unit \nrates  from  the  previous  fiscal  year,  and  include  amounts  for  completing  ongoing  works. \nDepending on the central allocations to the state roads sector for the corresponding fiscal year, \nand  the  share  of  federal  projects  in  the  work  program,  the  state  determines  and  allocates  the \nadditional  funding  needed  to  accomplish  PWD\u2019s  work  program  from  its  own  sources.  As  a \nresult, road investment has been uncoordinated and unstable. Moreover, this has perpetuated \nthe practice of preparing single-year work programs based on ad hoc criteria, which in turn has \ncreated opportunities for political interference.   \n \n8. \nWeak  Accounting  and  Reporting.  PWD  uses  manual  accounting  procedures,  which \nare  based  on  the  financial  handbook  adopted  by  Government  organizations  and  the  Central \nPublic  Works  accounts  Code.  PWD  does  not  have  (i)  a  formal  system  of  regular  financial \nmanagement  reporting,  (ii)  a  system  of  comparing  actual  expenditures  with  budgeted  and \nprogrammed  allocations,  or  (iii)  a  practice  of  exception  reporting.  The  comptroller  and  auditor \ngeneral  of  India  conduct  the  statutory  audit  of  PWD  once  per  year  through  the  Office  of  the \nState  Accountant  General  of  Uttaranchal,  which  is  also  responsible  for  the  accounting  and \nrecord  keeping  aspects of  PWD.  The  audit  report  is  not  received  on  a  timely  enough  basis  to \nallow corrective action to be taken. Further, an external audit opinion is not expressed on PWD \nas an entity.  \n\n                                                 \n1   About 6 months from mid-February to the end of June, and from mid-September to mid-November. \n2   Highlighted by working groups at an institutional review workshop conducted by the project preparatory technical \n\nassistance consultants in Dehradun on 10 April 2006. \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nInadequate  Supervision  and  Monitoring.  The  average  observed  service  life  of \n9. \nimproved  and  new  roads  is  almost  half  the  established  service  life  for  comparable  roads \ninternationally.  For  instance,  rehabilitation  is  needed  every  3\u20134  years,  compared  to  every  6\u20138 \nyears  if  properly  constructed.  This  is  attributable  to  construction  methods  and  material  that \nsometimes  are  unsuited  for  the  climate  and  terrain  in  Uttaranchal,  as  well  as  to  inadequate \nsupervision. Limited quality control and survey equipment, visual inspection and other imprecise \ntechniques,3  and  limited  expertise  among  the  engineers  constrain  supervision.  On  average,  a \nsupervision  engineer  makes  less  than  three  site  visits  per  month.  Periodic  maintenance \ninterventions are determined through ad hoc visual inspection of a limited number of roads.  \n \n10. \nDated Standards and Specifications. The sequence followed by the junior engineers \nwho prepare bidding documents is site inspection and identification of required intervention(s), \nfollowed  by  preparation  of  bills  of  quantities.  Force  account  workers  perform  typical \ninterventions under routine maintenance, including (i) shoulder repairs, (ii) pothole patching, (iii) \nlandscaping, (iv) removal of minor earth slips, and (v) road sign and furniture repair. However, \nperformance standards have not been established, and evaluation of works is highly subjective. \nConstruction  specifications  generally  are  set  according  to  Indian  Roads  Congress\u2019  geometric \nand pavement design standards.   \n \n11. \nLow Value of Contracts and Quality of Contractors. The practice of awarding many \nsmall  contracts  reduces  the  intensity  of  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  attracts  only \ncontractors with limited capacity to perform quality work (Appendix 2).   \n  \n12. \nLack  of  Incentives.  The  opportunities  for  promotion  and  career  development  are \nlimited. More than half the executive engineers and superintending engineers are designated as \n\u201cacting\u201d. Although training courses are available, finding a relevant course at a convenient time \nhas been difficult for most staff. \n \nC.  \n \n13. \nReduction  in  Implementation  Delays.  The  chief  secretary  of  Uttaranchal  has \ninstructed district magistrates to conduct biweekly coordination meetings with PWD, DOF, and \nother  relevant  government  agencies  to  ensure  that  all  clearance  applications  are  approved \nwithin 2 weeks.  \n \n14. \nIncreased Supervision Capacity. Funding has been allocated for purchasing 100 new \nvehicles, and additional surveying and testing equipment, in FY2006. Legislative approval has \nbeen  received  for  subdividing  the  two  existing  zones,  which  would  enable  the  number  of \noperational  zones  to  be  increased  to  four.  Additionally,  state  approval  has  been  sought  for  (i) \ndesignation  of  a  separate  chief  engineer  for  externally  funded  projects,  including  National \nHighways (NH), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB);  (ii)  establishing  one  maintenance  and  one  PMGSY  division  in  each  circle;  and  (iii) \nestablishing  asset  development  and  maintenance  cells  at  the  zone  level.  These  changes  are \nexpected  to  increase  accountability,  enable  more  delegation  of  duties  to  the  divisions  and \ncircles,  increase  monitoring  of  asset  development  and  asset  maintenance  targets,  increase \nfamiliarity with best practices, and increase overall return on investment.  \n \n\nOngoing or Planned Efficiency Improvement Initiatives \n\n                                                 \n3  For example, distance is based on odometer readings; pavement thickness is not based on soil strength; quantities \n\nare estimated using average per km values.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n41\n\nComputerization.  A  Web-based  management  information  and  project  management \n15. \nsystem (MIPMS) funded by the World Bank is expected to be introduced to PWD by December \n2006. This would vastly improve asset planning, budgeting, construction and maintenance work \nmonitoring, personnel management, and procurement.  \n \n16. \nDraft  Road  Policy.  A  draft  road  policy,  covering  10  years  through  2015,  has  been \nprepared  to  guide  road  sector  reforms  aimed  increasing  economic  growth  and  ensuring  an \nequitable distribution of benefits among regions and population groups. Reforms will ensure that \n(i)  investment  is  in  line  with  the  Road  Development  Plan  (RDP),  or  priorities  based  on  sound \ntechnical and economic criteria; (ii) asset maintenance strategies will increase service life and \nprivate  sector  participation;  (iii)  adequate  funds  are  available  for  road  development  and \nmaintenance; and (iv) legislation is in place to promote sector efficiency.  \n \n17. \nImproved Planning. The state has prepared a RDP to guide the implementation of the \nroad  policy  (Appendix  2).  Additionally,  the  state  government  has  approved  the  creation  of  a \nseparate  unit  within  PWD  headquarters  that  would  be  responsible  for  strategic  planning.  The \nplanning  unit  would  undertake  review  and  updating  of  the  RDP,  programming  and  budgeting, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  unit  will  be  headed  by  a  chief  engineer,  supported  by \nprofessionals.  The  organizational  chart  after  the  establishment  of  this  unit  is  shown  in  Figure \n3.2. \n \n\nFigure 3.2: Organizational Chart of PWD After Restructuring \n\nPublic Works Department Minister \n\nSecretary \u2013 Additional Secretary \u2013 Joint Secretary\n\nRoad Stakeholder Board \n\nContractor and Consultant Registration \nBoard \n\nEngineer-in-Chief \u2013 Level 1\n\nAdditional Engineer-in-Chief \nQuality and Strategic Planning\n\nSenior State Officer \nEstablishment\n\nFinance \nController\n\nChief Engineer \nExternal Funding \n\nChief Engineer \nDehradun \n\nChief Engineer \nPauri\n\nChief Engineer \nAlmora \n\nChief Engineer \nNainital\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChief Engineer  \n \nNational Highways \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nActions Required to Support Efficiency Initiatives \n\nInformation  Technology.  Staff  training  for  MIPMS  on  data  collection  and  input,  and \n\nIncreased  Stakeholder  Participation.  PWD  will  establish  a  road  board  to  increase \n18. \nstakeholder participation  and  transparency  of  decision  making.  This  board  will  ensure  that  the \nviews  of  road  users  and  stakeholders  are  considered  for  strategic  planning  and  investment \ndecision making. The secretary PWD would chair the board, which would include the engineer \nin chief of PWD, as well as six to eight members representing (i) private and public sector freight \nand passenger transport service providers, (ii) consumer protection groups, (iii) traffic police, (iv) \nchamber  of  commerce,  (v)  engineering  and  contractor  associations,  (vi)  the  state  accountant \ngeneral  or  a  senior  deputy  of  the  office  of  the  accountant  general,  and  (vii)  other  state \nstakeholder agencies.   \n \nE.  \n \n19. \nreport production will be needed to enhance PWD-wide usage of the system. \n \n20. \nBusiness Processes. Operations manuals and guidelines must be revised in line with \nthe contract administration duties that will ensue from the creation of new zones; establishment \nof  the  planning  division;  new  civil  works  procurement  methods,  such  as  performance-based \ncontracts;  and  the  need  to  be  more  customer-oriented.  The  state  also  must  finalize  the  road \npolicy  and  submit  it  for  approval  by  the  state  cabinet,  and  implement  the  organizational \nrestructuring. \n \n21. \nFinancial  management  and  corporate  governance  mechanisms  must  be  improved  to \nsupport  the  increased  level  of  investment,  based  on  the  RDP.  A  review  of  the  financial \nhandbook,  the  PWD  account  codes,  and  related  financial  guidelines  and  procedures  must  be \nundertaken  to  (i)  revise  and  update  financial  and  management  accounting  and  related \nprocedures, (ii) ensure compliance with related ADB financial management guidelines, and (iii) \nstrengthen procedures necessary to ensure compliance with anticorruption guidelines and good \ngovernance.  A  training  module  to  enhance  awareness  of  these  mechanisms  must  be \ndeveloped, and training sessions conducted.   \n \n22. \nAdequate annual financing is needed to implement the RDP if the share of state roads in \ngood condition4 is to be increased to 90% by 2017. An additional $14 million is needed to clear \nthe maintenance backlog.5   \n \nF.  \n \n23. \nTo  accelerate  the  reform  process  and  increase  its  impact,  ADB  has  prepared  an \ninfrastructure  management  component  to  be  implemented  under  Project  1  of  the  Investment \nProgram.  This  component  will  provide  technical  support  to  PWD  through  a  consulting  service \ncontract  to  restructure  PWD  and  reengineer  the  business  processes,  develop  a  human \nresources  strategy  and  provide  staff  and  contractor  training.  The  expected  outcomes  of  this \n\nADB Assistance \n\n                                                 \n4   Current condition of the network was estimated by the consultant engaged to develop the road development plan. \nThe estimate for 2015 is based on the length of scheduled for rehabilitation under the investment program plus an \naverage allowance of 150 km per year through the PWD program. \n\n5   The annual costs of routine and periodic maintenance are Rs1.05 billion and Rs0.95 billion respectively. Routine \nmaintenance  costs  are  based  on  unit  per  km  cost  estimates  for  5-year  post  construction  performance-based \ncontracting  on  PMGSY  roads  in  Uttaranchal  adjusted  for  road  width  and  condition  of  the  existing  PWD  network. \nPeriodic maintenance costs are based on per km costs for 50 mm bituminous concrete overlay applied on a six- to \neight-year cycle depending on road class.  \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43\n\ncomponents and implementation schedule are in Table A3. The outline terms of reference and \nscope of services for the consultants are in Supplementary Appendix 8.  \n \n24. \nOrganizational  Restructuring  and  Business  Process  Reengineering.  Support \nprovided  for  these  activities  will  cover  revisions  to  operating  manuals  to  reflect  the  new \nprocesses.  These  include  (i)  preparation  and  approval  of  divisional  budget  proposals;  (ii) \nsupervision  and  monitoring  of  works;  (iii)  procurement,  particularly  state-wide  performance-\nbased  maintenance  works;  (iv)  use  of  the  MIPMS;  and  (v)  guiding  and  assisting  the  PWD  in \nobtaining  the  necessary  approvals  for  the  revised  manuals.  The  revisions  will  be  based  on \ncurrent requirements and best practices in road construction and maintenance.   \n \n25. \nHuman  Resources  Strategy.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  skills  needed  to \nimplement the RDP, consultants will prepare and deliver training programs for PWD staff. They \nalso will provide training and guidance for the state road contractors. The main objective of the \ntraining modules is to familiarize PWD staff with the revised manuals.   \n \nFinancial  Management.  Finance  and  accounting  staff  deployed  at  the  PWD  divisions \n26. \nwill  receive  training  on  the  use  of  the  new  planning,  budgeting,  project  evaluation,  and \nmonitoring systems, as well as the MIPMS. Additionally, semiannual reporting requirements will \nbe introduced. A firm of chartered accountants will perform external audits, in compliance with \ninternational  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  to  ensure  transparency,  accountability,  and \ngood governance.   \n \n27.   Risk  Management  and  Insurance.

and \nhave minimal, if any, alignments through designated wildlife sanctuaries, national \nparks,  areas  that  are  of  international  significance  (e.g.,  protected  wetland \ndesignated by the Wetland Convention), or cultural heritage sites designated by \nUnited Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements \n\n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment  requirements  are  based  on  the \nEnvironment  (Protection)  Act,  1986;  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Notification,  1994 \nand  its  amendment  in  1997;  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest\u2019s  (MOEF)  Environmental \nImpact Assessment Guidelines for Rail, Road & Highways Projects, 1989; and the Indian Roads \nCongress  Guidelines  for  Environmental  Impacts  Assessment  (IRC:104-1988)  of  highway \nprojects.  In  addition,  the  road  improvement  and  rehabilitation  activities  require  also  to  comply \nwith Forest (Conservation) Act as amended in 1980; Forest (Conservation) Rules, 1981; Wildlife \n(Protection)  Act  1972;  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)  Act  1974  (Amended  1988); \nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 (As Amended in 1987); and Noise Pollution \n(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.  \n \n3. \n \n\nThese acts and regulations (para. 2) require  \n\nclearance from MOEF in the form of an approved environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)  report  for  all  improvements  and  rehabilitation  activities  within  the  purview  of \nenvironmental  assessment  notification  and  located  in  the  protected  areas  and \nreserve forest areas;  \nclearance  from  the  Uttaranchal  Department  of  Forests  to  carry  out  the  work  within \nforest  areas,  to  use  forest  land  for  non-forest  purposes,  and  to  fell  roadside  trees; \nthe department also requires that cutting of trees be compensated by compensatory \nafforestation;   \na  no-objection  certificate  (consent  to  establish  and  consent  to  operate)  from  state \nPollution  Control  Board  before  establishment  and  placement  of  hot-mix  plants, \nquarrying and crushers, and batch mixing plants; and   \npermission  from  Uttaranchal  Ground  Water  Board  to  extract  water  for  construction \npurposes. \n\n4. \nBased on the Government and Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Environmental Policy \n(2002), the Uttaranchal Public Works Department (PWD) is expected to undertake the following \nfor the roads in the subsequent years:   \n\nPerform  an  environmental  assessment  of  each  road  depending  on  its  potential \nimpacts.  Based  on  these  potential  impacts,  each  road  must  be  classified  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nguidelines, using the ADB\u2019s rapid environmental assessment.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n67\n\n(ii) \n\n(b) \n\nPerform an EIA and prepare an environmental management and monitoring plan \n(EMP)  for  each  road  in  category  A.

However, PWD has the main responsibility for undertaking environmental due diligence \nand monitoring the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for all roads. The due \ndiligence  report,  as  well  as  monitoring  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan \nas part of the annual report, needs to be documented systematically.  \n \nE. \n \nPWD  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documentation, \n8. \nincluding  the  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  reports,  are  kept  properly  and \nsystematically as part of the PWD project record. \n\nPublic Disclosure \n\nAll environmental documents are subject to public disclosure. As such, these documents \n\n9. \nshould be made available to public, if requested \n\nInstitutional Arrangements  \n\nFor  a  category  A  road,  the  summary  EIA  needs  to  be  disclosed  to  the  public  through \n\n10. \nADB, 120 days before beginning approval of the roads.    \n \nF. \n \nThe  executive  engineers  in  PWD  divisional  offices  have  been  assigned  to  process \n11. \nenvironment-related  clearances  for  all  projects  within  PWD.  The  chief  engineer  at  the \ndepartment  level  and  the  division  office  at  the  district  level  will  monitor  execution  of  PWD\u2019s \nprojects.  However,  PWD\u2019s  activities  have  specific  guidelines  or  instructions  on  managing \nenvironmental  impacts.  Therefore,  with  ADB\u2019s  requirement  to  mainstream  environmental  and \nsocial concerns in its development program, PWD needs to institutionalize such concerns.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n69\n\nTo  implement  the  Investment  Program,  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  at  the \n12. \ndepartment  level  has  been  established  with  staff  seconded  from  PWD.  Environmental  and \nsocial  development  experts  will  support  the  PMU  in  implementing  this  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF). These experts will assist the project implementation \nunits (PIU), which will be responsible for managing the roads. PIU executive engineers, who will \nbe trained on environmental management by the PMU specialists, will monitor implementation \nof the environmental management plan in the field. Nine PIUs are expected to be established.  \n \nthe  environmental  monitoring,  hiring \n13. \nenvironmental  specialists,  and  implementing  the  EARF  will  be  financed  under  the  Uttaranchal \nState-Road Investment Program.  \n\ntraining,  undertaking \n\nCost  of  conducting \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n\nThe proposed Uttaranchal State-Road Investment Program is a part of the state\u2019s infrastructure vision, which \ncovers improvement of the existing road network and provision of all-weather accessibility to rural areas. The \nInvestment Program will help Uttaranchal Public Works Department (PWD) to develop their road network, as \nwell as to build the capacity of road sector institutions at the state level and contribute to effective and efficient \nmanagement  of  the  road  assets.  About  10,800  kilometers  of  project  roads,  including  state  highways,  major \ndistrict roads, other district roads, and village roads, were selected because they offer the best opportunities to \nimprove road network connectivity within the states, and provide a connection between the lesser roads and \nthe  national  highway  network.  The  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  as  seven  projects,  which  have \nbeen  programmed  according  to  the  level  of  urgency  and  importance  attached  to  the  roads  selected  for \nimprovement. Pre-construction work on about 570 kilometers of the selected roads has been completed, and \nwill be implemented under the first project (Project 1). The road sections to be improved in Projects 5\u20137 will be \nreprioritized and designed during implementation. The Investment Program will benefit directly the poor living \nin the region, as road transport is the primary\u2014and often the only\u2014form of transport. Thus, an efficient road \nnetwork  linking  villages,  towns,  and  cities  will  provide  stronger  links  between  remote  and  poor  regions  and \nmore  developed  markets.  Infrastructure  development  encourages  other  development  initiatives,  which \ntogether  considerably  stimulate  economic  growth.  Thus,  the  investment  is  expected  to  improve  the \nsocioeconomic situation significantly, and enhance poverty reduction. \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nThe  project  roads  are  spread  across  all  the  13  districts  of  Uttaranchal.  The  planning  commission  estimates \nthat more than 35%  of the state\u2019s population lives in poverty. The sample socioeconomic survey carried out \nalong  the  roads  to  be  improved  under  Project  1  indicates  that  3  to  6%  of  the  households  lived  in  poverty. \nHowever, the levels of poverty are expected to be much higher in the interior villages of the districts. As a new \nstate, Uttaranchal does not have much data available on the extent of poverty in the 13 hill districts. However, \nestimates  show  that  the  people  are  surviving  by  depending  on  remittances  (about$72.7  million)  yearly  from \nmigrant workers all over India. The population in the Project 1 catchment area consists largely of rural people \n(75%), the majority of whom are farmers and unskilled laborers. During the social assessment along the road \nsections, 4\u201311% were found to be involved in businesses, while 19\u201335% of the households were engaged in \nagricultural activities. On average, women spend 4 hours on household activities and 5 hours on agricultural \nactivities  per  day,  and  have  to  travel  10\u201312  kilometers  (km)  a  day.  The  average  distance  that  households \ntravel to access the nearest health facilities ranged from 3 to 6 km. In most of the districts, the survey reported, \npeople have to travel 6\u20137 km to the nearest bus stop to use local transport. The frequency of local transport is \nvery poor. In most cases, only one government bus is available per day, forcing people to use other forms of \ninformal local transport services. In cases of emergency, people depend on these private transport services, \nwhich cost more. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  benefit  directly  approximately  3.5  million  people  living  in  the  villages  along  the \nroads. Vehicle ownership among the residents of adjoining areas is low, and generally limited to two-wheelers. \nAs a result, significant operating cost savings are unlikely to be passed on to local road users. However, users \nwill benefit from time savings. The government is involved heavily in the operation of public transport services, \nwith  the  state  governments  effectively  setting  fares.  In  the  hill  areas,  informal  passenger  transport  services \nprovided  by  light  vehicle  owners,  which  are  largely  unregulated,  are  thriving.  Freight  services  are  more \ncompetitive, with a large proportion of these benefits likely to be passed on to the community through higher \nservice  frequencies.  As  the  Investment  Program  will  improve  road  surfaces,  widen  some  sections  within  the \nexisting rights-of-way, and replace bridges, it will reduce travel times and lower operating vehicle costs. With \nimproved roads and better connectivity, farmers will be able to transport agricultural products and perishables \nto  neighboring  markets  more  easily.  The  Investment  Program  will  enable  reliable  access  to  social  services, \nparticularly health care services and education facilities. It also will benefit those who use the project roads to \naccess district town centers, and the national highway network. People will benefit from lower transport costs, \nlowering consumer prices and inducing economic and social development. The Investment Program also will \ngenerate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  construction.  Unskilled \nlabor (males and females) will be employed directly in road construction and indirectly by providing materials \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n71\n\nand  services  to  the  construction  and  maintenance  activities.  Project  1  will  generate  about  912,600  person-\ndays of  work for unskilled  workers, while the Investment Program  will generate 8.4 million person days. The \npoverty impact ratio of Project 1 is 0.30.  \n \nThe improved road network also will improve links between the village communities and urban centers, which \nprovide  wider  marketing  opportunities  for  agricultural  and  other  indigenous  products.  People  will  have  wider \noptions  in  buying  and  selling  their  commodities.  Small  and  petty  village  traders  may  tap  bigger  markets, \ntransport  produce  faster,  and  receive  higher  prices,  instead  of  depending  solely  on  local  markets  and \nintermediaries. Road networks not only link the village communities to better markets, but also open up wider \nwork  opportunities  in  distant  places.  People  can  shuttle  to  distant  work  sites  and  towns  for  construction, \nfactory,  business,  and  domestic  jobs.  When  transportation  is  efficient,  people  can  engage  in  regular  work \nwithout  migrating  permanently  or  seasonally.  Improved  roads  also  will  encourage  urban  entrepreneurs  to \ninvest  in  commercial  farming  and  industrial  activities  in  remote  areas.  Villagers  may  create  new  business \npartnerships that, in turn, develop their entrepreneurship skills. With more money flowing to the villages, more \nwork  opportunities  will  be  generated  through  multiplier  effect  and  backward-forward  links  in  the  economy. \nPeople will have opportunities to open up tea stalls, hotels, garages, and rest houses, which would generate \nskilled and unskilled jobs. With the improved networking and cash management, the villagers can tap into new \ninstitutional  credit  and  financial  services.  The  scope  for  better  management  of  public  schemes  also  will \nincrease,  which  will  help  people  gain  new  knowledge  on  improved  farming,  land  development,  and \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  natural  resources  through  the  formation  of  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  committees.  Thus,  direct  benefits  (access  to  social  services,  market,  credit  facilities,  new \ntechnology, etc.) and indirect benefits (employment) of the Investment Program  will help reduce poverty and \nimprove the quality of life of people. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n   No \n\n \n\nAs part of Project 1 preparation, consultations were held at the level of primary and secondary stakeholders, \nincluding directly affected people, Executing Agency, local administration departments in the Project\u2019s area of \ninfluence, and nongovernment organizations. Issues related to the proposed project development and various \nactivities  involved  in  the  planning  and  implementation  were  discussed.  At  the  field  level,  37  focus  group \ndiscussions  were  held  in  subproject  areas  under  Project  1  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  perspective  on  the \nProject  and  its  impacts.  These  discussions  involved  village  administrative  officers,  men,  women,  farmers, \nbusiness communities, concerned government departments, and disadvantaged groups. The main objective of \nthese discussions was to ascertain (i) community response to the Project, (ii) community needs and demands \nfrom the Project, (iii) an estimate of losses that the community  would suffer, and (iv)  steps to mitigate those \nlosses.  The  directly  affected  populations  were  consulted  to  understand  their  concerns  regarding  the  road \nconstruction,  and  to  gather  suggestions  on  the  types  of  mitigation  measures  that  should  be  considered  to \naddress the envisaged impacts. \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen  in  the  region  are  involved  largely  in  household  work,  cultivation,  and  other  agricultural  activities, \nspending 12\u201317 hours per day to carry out these activities. The reasons for their road use ranges from day-to-\nday household activities to economic activities, such as agriculture and marketing, for which they travel up to \n10\u201312 km per day. The improvement in road conditions and improved connectivity of village roads to the main \nnetwork  will encourage better transport services, thereby improving access for women and children to social \nservices,  markets,  workplace,  higher  levels  of  schooling,  and  better  health  facilities.  In  addition  to  the \nimprovement in transport services, travel time savings due to improved road conditions will allow them more \ntime  to  make  frequent  visits  to  health  clinics,  access  marketing  and  credit  facilities,  and  seek  better \nemployment opportunities. The project design also includes provision for bus stops, rest sheds  with  drinking \nwater  facilities,  and  public  toilets,  which  also  will  benefit  women.  During  construction,  women  will  have  the \nopportunity  to  gain  employment  in  construction  and  associated  activities.  Along  the  road  corridor,  women \nnormally  are  involved  in  roadside  activities,  such  as  running  small  eateries,  tea  stalls,  and  pan  shops,  etc. \nThus,  with  the  envisaged  colonies  for  construction  workers  and  contractors,  petty  businesses\u2014e.g.,  tea  or \nfood  stalls,  and  groceries,  etc.\u2014will  flourish.  This  will  benefit  women  by  improving  their  income-earning \ncapacities.  In  Project  1,  no  households  headed  by  women  will  be  adversely  affected.  However,  adequate \nprovision  is  included  in  the  resettlement  framework  to  mitigate  risks  and  reduce  the  hardship  of  women  in \nsubsequent  projects.  During  the  Investment  Program  implementation,  women  will  receive  preferential \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ntreatment  for  employment  in  civil  works,  and  will  receive  equal  wages  to  men  for  work  of  equal  value  with \nproper safeguards for the safety of their health. \n\nE.

The  subprojects  pass  mostly  through  hilly \nterrain and rural areas, where settlements adjacent \nto the road sections are thinly populated. Of the 23 \nsubprojects,  only \nfour  will  have  resettlement \nimpacts.  A  detailed  census  was  conducted  in  the \nfour  road  sections,  and  short  resettlement  plans \nwere  prepared  for  each.  No  private  land  will  be \nacquired.  However,  17  encroacher  and  squatter \nhouseholds  (totaling  87  affected  persons)  will \nsuffer  partial  impacts  on  their  residential  and \ncommercial  structures.  Of  the  18  structures  that \nwill  be  affected,  six  are  residential,  commercial, \nand residential-cum-commercial. A majority (11) of \nthe  affected  structures  are  boundary  walls  of \nprivate  residences,  schools,  kitchens,  and  vacant \nstructures.  One  religious  structure  will  be  partially \naffected.  \n\nresettlement \n\nA \n(Supplementary \nframework \nAppendix  6)  has  been  prepared  for  the  remaining \nphases.

Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF),  the  Investment  Program  will  have  two  major  components:  (i) \nimprovement  of  about  10,800  kilometers  (km)  of  the  existing  road  network;  and  (ii) \nstrengthening  of  the  infrastructure  management  capacity  of  Uttaranchal\u2019s  Public  Works \nDepartment  (PWD),  which  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  Investment  Program.  The  first \ncomponent  will  focus  on  improving  the  condition  of  the  road  network  by  carrying  out \nrehabilitation and reconstruction works that are confined mostly within the existing rights-of-way \n(ROW). \n \n2. \nFollowing  the  Strategic  Option  Study  and  the  pre-feasibility  study,  PWD  has  identified \nand  prioritized  around  5,600  km  of  roads  for  improvement.  Of  the  prioritized  roads,  detailed \nproject  reports  based  on  detailed  design  have  been  prepared  for  573  kilometers  of  roads  (23 \nroads),  which  will  form  Project  1  of  the  MFF.  The  scope  of  the  Project  1  road  improvement \ncomponent includes strengthening and reconstructing selected sections of state highways  (SH), \nmajor  district  roads  (MDR),  and  other  district  roads  (ODR).  In  general,  the  existing  single-lane \ncarriageway (3.5 meters) will be retained with some standardization. Upgrading to intermediate (5 \nmeters) and two-lane carriageway (7 meters) might be necessary on technical, traffic, and safety \ngrounds  in  a  few  cases.  Final  selection  of  road  sections,  and  detailed  project  reports  for \nsubsequent  projects,  will  be  prepared  during  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  In \nProject 1, the resettlement impacts are confined to four of the 23 roads. Four short resettlement \nplans (SRP) have been prepared for these roads. This summary resettlement plan is for those \nfour roads: (i) Dhakia\u2013Gulabo\u2013Pagia\u2013Mukundpur, (ii) Almora\u2013Bageshwar, (iii) Raniket\u2013Mohan, \nand (iv) Kakrali\u2013Thuligarh. As land acquisition will not be required for any of the roads, no legal \ntitle  holders  will  be  affected.  However,  some  encroachers  and  squatters  will  lose  portions  of \ntheir structures and sources of livelihood.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  aim  of  the  SRPs  are  to  mitigate  all  unavoidable  negative  social  and  resettlement-\nspecific  impacts  caused  due  to  the  the  road  improvements.  To  protect  the  rights  of  affected \npersons  (AP)  and  communities,  the  plans  have  been  prepared  based  on  survey  findings  and \nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995) and Indigenous Peoples (1999). The issues identified and addressed in the SRPs are (i) \nthe  type  and  extent  of  loss  of  land  and  non-land  assets,  loss  of  livelihood,  or  income \nlosses,  such  as  common  property  resources  and  social \nopportunities,  and  collective \ninfrastructure; (ii) impacts on indigenous people and vulnerable groups, specifically women; (iii) \nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  and  scope  of  people\u2019s  participation  in  the  project;  (iv)  existing \nlegal  and  administrative  framework,  and  formulation  of  resettlement  framework  for  the \nInvestment  Program;  (v)  entitlement  matrix  with  provisions  for  relocation  assistance  and \nrestoration  of  business  incomes;  (vi)  cost  estimate  for  implementation  of  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation  (R&R)  activities;  and  (vii)  institutional  framework  for  the  implementation  of  plan, \nincluding a monitoring and evaluation mechanism.  \n\nScope and Objectives of the Short Resettlement Plans \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n75\n\nResettlement Impacts \n\nC. \n \n4. \nThe proposed work for all the road sections includes strengthening of existing single or \nintermediate-lane carriageway, and widening of existing single-lane carriageway to intermediate \nlane.  The  required  formation  width  varies  from  5  meters  to  7.5  meters  in  single-lane  and \nintermediate-lane  carriageway,  respectively.  The  four  roads  pass  through  mostly  hilly  terrain. \nAccording to PWD records, the ROW available varies from 9 meters to 15 meters. Minimization \nof  resettlement  was  achieved  mainly  by  reducing  the  corridor  of  impact.  Based  on  the \navailability of ROW and  likely improvement strategy, an agreement was reached with affected \npersons and PWD to reduce the corridor of impact to the minimum required construction width. \nThis helped reduce the resettlement impact considerably in a majority of the road sections\u2014and \nin some cases by 100%. In 19 of the 23 road sections, the resettlement impact was eliminated. \nThe  minimization  of  resettlement  impacts  for  the  four  road  sections  are  summarized  in  Table \nA10.1. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Minimization of Resettlement Impact \n\nRoad Section \n\nDhakia\u2013Gulabo\u2013Pagia\u2013Mukundpur \nRaniket\u2013Mohan \nAlmora\u2013Bageshwar \nKakrali\u2013Thuligarh \n\nTotal \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nNo. of Affected Families \n\nBefore Mitigation \n52 \n413 \n1422 \n39 \n1,926 \n\nAfter Mitigation \n14 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n18 \n\nNo. of Families \nSaved \n38 \n411 \n1421 \n38 \n1,908 \n\n \n5. \nAfter  minimizing  the  impacts  by  adopting  a  suitable  engineering  option,  only  18 \nstructures will be affected. The type and use of various structures, with number of households \nand APs as enumerated during the census survey, are summarized in the Table A10.2.  \n\n \nTable A10.2: Types and Uses of Affected Structures \n\nTypes of Structures \n\nResidential Structures \nResidential and Commercial Structures \nCommercial Structures \nOther Private Structuresa\nReligious Structures \n\nTotal \n\nNo. of \nStructures \n1 \n4 \n1 \n11 \n1 \n18 \n\nNo. of \nHouseholds \n1 \n4 \n1 \n11 \n0 \n17 \n\nNo. of APs \n\n4 \n24 \n9 \n50 \n0 \n87 \n\nAP = affected person \na The other private structures include boundary walls, private school, kitchens, and vacant room. \nSource: ADB estimates \n\n \n \n\nOf the 18 private structures likely to be affected, 14 belong to encroachers and three to \n6. \nsquatters with no land titles. The four residential-cum-commercial structures that will be affected \nbelong  to  encroachers.  The  six  APs  who  will  lose  the  boundary  walls  of  their  residences,  and \none AP who will lose a portion of his kitchen, are encroachers. In addition, two private schools \nthat  also  will  lose  their  boundary  walls  are  encroaching  on  government  ROW.  The  three \nsquatter  households  will  suffer  partial  impacts  on  a  commercial  structure,  a  kitchen,  and  a \nvacant room, respectively. More than half of the boundary walls of the residential structures will \nbe lost, while two residential and commercial structures also will suffer up to 30% loss. The rest \nof  the  structures  will  lose  only  10%  of  their  total  structures.  Of  the  affected  structures,  12  are \npermanent, one is semi-permanent, and the remaining five are temporary. \n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRelocation and Compensation \n\nIssues Related with Indigenous People  \n\nSocioeconomic Profile of the Affected Persons \n\nD. \n \n7. \nPeople living along the roads are from various socioeconomic groups. Of the 17 affected \nhouseholds,  about  10  households  live  in  poverty  line  and  two  households  are  from  scheduled \ncastes.  None  of  the  households  are  headed  by  women,  or  involve  scheduled  tribes  physically \nhandicapped persons. The average size of the affected households is 6.2 people, though one \nhousehold  has  more  than  10.  In  general,  the  economy  of  the  area  is  agrarian.  Most  of  the \nroadside settlers are involved into petty roadside businesses, though about five of the affected \nhouseholds  are  also  employed  in  the  government  sector.  About  12  households  have  annual \nincomes of less than Rs20,000, while and remaining have an annual income of about Rs50,000. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nRelocation  of  households  is  not  envisaged  in  any  of  the  road  sections,  as  none  of  the \nresidential or commercial structures will be lost totally. Most of the structures would lose around \n10%  of  their  total  area.  The  APs  have  indicated  of  rebuilding  their  structures  within  their \navailable existing land. For that, they need advance notification and some assistance from the \nExecuting Agency.   \n \nF. \n \n9. \nIn the state of Uttaranchal, scheduled tribes constitute only 3% of the population. Project \n1 will not adversely impact any scheduled tribe households. The tribal population in Uttaranchal \nand the areas affected by the roads is integrated with the modern and dominant population of \nthe  state.  Tribal  groups  in  the  project  area  freely  interact  and  share  their  sources  of  water, \nfolklore, food, infrastructure, and other belongings with the mainstream population and outside \ncommunity. Moreover, these groups have nuclear families and are open to new ideas, such as \nfamily  planning  and  formal  education.  Therefore,  the  socioeconomic  impacts  due  to  roads  will \nbe the same for these people as the mainstream population. In view of these facts, a separate \nindigenous people development plan (IPDP) was not prepared for any road.   \n \nG. \n \n10.  Women  in  the  region  are  involved  largely  in  household  work,  cultivation,  and  other \nagricultural  activities.  They  use  the  roads  for  their  routine  household  activities  and  economic \nactivities,  such  as  agriculture  and  marketing.  Availability  of  all-weather  roads  with  safe \nconnectivity and better transport services will benefit the women of the area. Their mobility will \nbe  augmented,  allowing  them  to  access  social services,  higher  levels  of  schooling,  and  better \nhealth facilities. Project 1 roads will not adversely affect any households headed by women.   \n \nH. \n \n11. \nIn  India,  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894),  which  has  been  amended  from  time  to  time, \ngoverns  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  assistance  for  project-affected \npeople. The state government does not have a policy on resettlement and rehabilitation. Under \nthe  Land  Acquisition  Act,  compensation  is  paid  only  to  the  legal  titleholders.  Non-titleholders, \nsuch  as  encroachers,  squatters,  etc.,  are  not  entitled  to  compensation.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  adopted  a  national  policy  on  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  (NPRR)  on \nproject-affected families, known as NPRR-2004, to address development-induced resettlement. \nThe policy essentially addresses the need to (i) provide succor to the asset-less rural poor; and \n(ii)  support  the  rehabilitation  efforts  of  the  resource-poor  sections,  particularly  small  and \n\nReview of Government Policy and Resettlement Principles for the Project \n\nGender Issues in the Project \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n77\n\nmarginal  farmers,  scheduled  castes  and  tribes,  and  women  who  have  been  displaced.  For \nacquisition of strips of land for railway lines, highways, transmission lines, and pipelines, only an \nex  gratia  payment  of  Rs10,000  per  family  is  to  be  paid  under  NPRR.  This  policy  does  not \nrecognize squatters and encroachers, and no provision is made for resettlement assistance and \ntransitional  allowances,  etc.  Despite  these  provisions,  the  policy  does  not  restrict  the \ncompensation  of  lost  assets  to  replacement  cost.  Based  on  this  analysis  of  Government \nprovisions  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  project-specific  R&R \nmeasures have been formulated.  \n \n12. \nIn  accordance  with  the  R&R  measures  suggested  for  the  Investment  Program,  all \naffected  households  and  persons  will  be  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  packages \nand resettlement assistance. The support will depend on the nature of ownership rights of lost \nassets and scope of the impacts, including the socioeconomic vulnerability of the APs. The APs \nwill  be  entitled  to  the  following  five  types  of  compensation  and  assistance  packages:  (i) \ncompensation  for  the  loss  of  land,  and  crops  or  trees  at  their  replacement  value;  (ii) \ncompensation  for  structures  (residential  or  commercial)  and  other  immovable  assets  at  their \nreplacement value; (iii) assistance in lieu of the loss of business or wage income; (iv) assistance \nfor shifting; and (v) rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources or facilities.  \n \n13. \nCompensation  for  the  lost  assets  of  APs  will  be  paid  based  on  replacement  value. \nResettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods will be provided to titleholders and non-\ntitleholders,  such  as  people  with \nland  rights,  and  roadside \nresidences/owners with permits from local agencies to which they are paying annual tax for the \nsame. The vulnerable group comprises (i) APs living in poverty, (ii) scheduled castes and tribes, \n(iii)  households  headed  by  women,  and  (iv)  the  elderly  and  disabled.  An  entitlement  matrix \n(Table A10.3) has been developed, which recognizes and lists various types of losses resulting \nfrom  a  project,  and  provides \nfor  compensation  and  resettlement  packages.  Further, \ncompensation and assistance will be paid to APs in the first section of each contract package, \nbefore  commencement  of  civil  works  in  first  section  and  displacement  or  dispossession  of \nassets.  The  subsequent  sections  under  each  contract  package  will  be  handed  over  to  the \ncontractor only after compensation/assistance to the APs is completed for each of the sections. \n \nTable A10.3: Entitlement Matrix \n\ntraditional  or  customary \n\n  Type of Loss \n\n1 \n\nLoss of  \nresidential and \ncommercial \nstructure  by \nencroachers  \n\nUnit of \nEntitlement \nHouseholds \nwho have \nillegally \nextended \ntheir legally \nowned land \nor property \nonto public or \nother private \nland \n\nEntitlement \n\nDetails \n\n(cid:131) No compensation for land \n(cid:131) Compensation for structures to only \n\nvulnerable household \n\n(cid:131) Encroachers will be notified and given \na time in to remove their assets and \nharvest their crops. \n\n(cid:131) Shifting assistance for vulnerable \n\n(cid:131)  Compensation for structures at \n\n(cid:131) R&R assistance only to vulnerable \n\nencroachers \n\nhouseholds \n\n(cid:131) Right to salvage materials \n\nreplacement cost to the vulnerable \nhouseholds. \n\n(cid:131)  Training would be provided to \nupgrade the skills of the APs \nbelonging to vulnerable groups who \nlost their commercial structures. \n\n(cid:131) Shifting allowance of Rs1,500\u20132,500 \nor lump sum for shifting depending on \nthe type of structure and extent of \nimpact. \n\n(cid:131) Right to salvage materials from the \n\ndemolished structure. \n\n2  Loss of \n\nHouseholds \n\n(cid:131)  No compensation for land \n\n(cid:131)  Compensation for loss of structure at \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  Type of Loss \n\nresidential and \ncommercial \nstructure by \nsquatters or \ninformal settlers \n\nUnit of \nEntitlement \nliving or \nearning their \nlivelihood by \nillegally \noccupying \npublic or \nprivate land \n\nEntitlement \n\nDetails \n\n(cid:131)  Compensation for structures. \n(cid:131)  Shifting assistance \n(cid:131)  R&R assistance \n(cid:131)  Right to salvage materials \n\nreplacement cost.  \n\n(cid:131)  A lump sum shifting amount of \n\nRs1500\u20132500 depending on the type \nof structure. \n\n(cid:131)  Squatters or informal settlers will be \nnotified and given a time to remove \ntheir assets. \n\n(cid:131)  Transitional allowance of Rs3000 for \n3\u20136 months, depending on the extent \nof impact.  \n\n(cid:131)  Training would be provided to \n\nupgrade the skills to the APs who \nlose their commercial structures. \n(cid:131)  Right to salvage material from the \n\ndemolished structure. \n\n(cid:131)  Project-assisted relocation option will \n\nbe provided to those whose \nresidential or commercial structures \nbecome unlivable as a result of \nproject impacts.

During loan implementation, if additional impacts are identified, the entitlement matrix will \nbe updated by including provision of compensation and assistance for the additional impacts in \nthe short resettlement plans. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n79\n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nConsultation and Public Participation \n\nI. \n \n15. \nAll  relevant  aspects  of  project  planning  and  development  were  discussed  with  primary \nand  secondary  stakeholders,  including  directly  affected  people,  Executing  Agency,  and  other \nlocal administrative agencies and departments. The directly affected population was consulted \nto understand their concerns and receive their suggestions on the types of mitigation measures \nthat should be considered to address them. At the field level, 37 focus group discussions were \nheld  for  all  23  roads.  To  ensure  a  comprehensive  perspective  on  the  project  and  its  impacts, \nthese discussions involved (i) village panchayats, (ii) village administrative officers, (iii) men, (iv) \nwomen,  (v)  farmers,  (vi)  business  communities,  (vii)  concerned  government  departments,  and \n(viii) disadvantaged groups. Further, the consultations and discussions with the project-affected \npeople  will  continue  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  Program.  A  local  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) will assist the project implementation units (PIU) with it. The NGO involved \nin  the  resettlement  implementation  activities  will  keep  the  APs  informed  about  the  impacts, \ncompensation,  and  assistance  proposed  for  them;  and  will  facilitate  in  addressing  any \ngrievances.  The  summary  of  the  short  resettlement  plans  and  the  entitlement  matrix  will  be \ntranslated  into  the  local  language;  disclosed  to  the  APs;  and  made  available  at  the  offices  of \nPWD and project management unit (PMU) and on the ADB Web site.  \n \nJ. \n \n16. \nPWD has set up a project management unit (PMU) in Dehradun, which will be functional \nfor  the  duration  of  the  Project.  For  resettlement  activities,  the  PMU  will  handle  overall \ncoordination, planning, implementation, and financing. The PMU will create a resettlement cell, \nwith  appointment  of  a  resettlement  officer  (the  rank  of  an  executive  engineer)  and  required \nsupport  staff  for  the  duration  of  the  Project,  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of \nRPs. The consultant appointed by PWD for preparation of RPs for Project 2 roads will assist the \nresettlement  officer.  A  social  development  or  resettlement  specialist  under  the  loan-financed \nsupervision consultant will be responsible for implementation of the RPs for subsequent roads. \nPIU  will  be  established  at  PWD  circle  level  for  implementation  of  the  project.  The  PMU  will \ncoordinate  with  PIUs  for  road-level,  RP-related  activities,  and  each  PIU  will  designate  one \nsenior  staff  (not  below  the  rank  of  an  executive  engineer)  to  coordinate  the  resettlement \nactivities. The PIU, if required by the workload, also will appoint an assistant resettlement officer \n(at  the  rank  of  assistant  engineer)  with  adequate  land  acquisition  implementation  expertise., \nwho  will  be  deputed  from  PWD  to  the  PIU  or  engaged  on  contractual  basis  The  social  or \nresettlement  specialist  of  the  supervision  consultant  will  train  the  staffs  at  the  PIU  level  for \nimplementation of the RP. The PIU will maintain all databases, work closely with APs and other \nstakeholders,  and  monitor  the  day-to-day  resettlement  activities.  In  addition,  an  experienced \nand well-qualified NGO in this field will be engaged to assist the PIUs in the implementation of \nthe RP. Due to the limited resettlement impacts of the project, only one NGO will be hired for the \nProject 1 roads. The NGO would play the role of a facilitator, and will work as a link between the \nPIU and the affected community.  \n \n17. \nA  grievance  redress  committee  (GRC)  at  the  PIU  level  will  be  formed  to  handle  APs\u2019 \ndisputes  and  grievances,  and  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  GRC  will  be \nheaded  by  the  district  collector,  or  a  representative  from  the  collector\u2019s  office.  The  GRC  will \ninclude representatives from (i) the PIU office; (ii) APs, particularly of vulnerable APs; (iii) local \ngovernment; (iv) NGOs; and (v) other interest groups. The GRC will meet to review grievances \ninvolving resettlement benefits, compensation, relocation, and other assistance. \n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nK. \n \n18. \nInternal  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  PMU,  PIU  and  the \nimplementing NGO. An independent monitoring and evaluation consultant (IMEC) will be hired \nfor  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project.  In  view  of  the  minimum  impacts \nexpected from the Project, the external monitoring and evaluation shall be done by engaging an \nindividual consultant with intermittent input  during the project period. The PMU, PIU and NGO \nwill be responsible for internal monitoring. The internal monitoring by PMU and PIU will include: \n(i)  administrative  monitoring,  including  (a)  daily  planning,  implementation,  feedback,  and \ntroubleshooting;  (b)  individual  AP  database  maintenance;  and  (c)  progress  reports;  (ii) \nsocioeconomic  monitoring,  including  case  studies  using  baseline  information  to  compare  AP \nsocioeconomic conditions, evacuation, demolition, salvaging materials, morbidity and mortality, \ncommunity relationships, dates for consultations, and number of appeals placed; and (iii) impact \nevaluation  monitoring,  including  income  standards  restored  or  improved,  and  socioeconomic \nconditions  of  the  APs.  PIU  will  provide  the  PMU  with  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports \ndocumenting  progress  on  resettlement  implementation,  and  RP  completion  reports,  for  review \nand approval by ADB. \n \n19. \nFor  external  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  the  PMU  will  engage  an  IMEC  with \nexperience  in  resettlement  activities  and  familiarity  with  Government  and  ADB  resettlement \npolicy. The IMEC will be engaged with ADB concurrence within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe IMEC will monitor and verify RP implementation to (i) determine whether resettlement goals \nhave  been  achieved,  (ii)  assess  whether  livelihood  and  living  standards  have  been  restored, \nand  (iii)  recommend  improvements.  Monitoring  also  will  ensure  recording  that  APs\u2019  views  are \nrecorded on resettlement issues, such as (i) their understanding of entitlement policies, options, \nand  alternatives;  (ii)  site  conditions;  (iii)  compensation  valuation  and  disbursement;  (iv) \ngrievance  redress  procedures;  and  (v)  staff  competencies.  The  IMEC  also  will  evaluate  the \nperformance of the PIU and NGOs. PMU will submit quarterly progress reports, while the IMEC \nwill  report  its  findings  simultaneously  to  the  Executing  Agency  and  to  ADB  twice  a  year. \nFinancial  provisions  will  be  made  under  the  project  budget  for  the  suggested  institutional \narrangements, such as establishing a resettlement cell, appointing a resettlement officer, hiring \nan NGO, and hiring an IMEC. \n \nL. \n \n20. \nThe implementation period for the SRPs under Project 1 will begin from third quarter of \n2006  to  the  first  quarter  of  2007.  The  R&R  cost  estimate  for  all  roads  includes  (i)  eligible \ncompensation  and  resettlement  assistance,  (ii) establishment  of  resettlement  unit,  (iii)  staffing, \n(iv)  training,  (v)  transportation,  (vi)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  (vii)  involvement  of  an  NGO  in \nproject  implementation,  and  (viii)  other  administrative  expenses.  The  cost  structure  that  has \nbeen used in the cost estimates has been derived through rapid field appraisal, and consultation \nwith  affected  households  and  relevant  local  authorities.  This  will  be  updated  during  the \nimplementation. To cover the cost of updating these estimates, an additional provision has been \nmade  with  15%  contingency.  The  estimated  R&R  cost,  including  implementation  cost  of  the \nProject 1 roads, is about $66,432. \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation Cost Estimate \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 March.
