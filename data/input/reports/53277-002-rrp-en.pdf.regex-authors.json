THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Assam Skill University Project. The report also describes the proposed administration \nof technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nSupporting the Development of Higher-Level Skills and Entrepreneurship, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will assist the Government of Assam in strengthening its skills education and \ntraining system to ensure decent employment for all and accelerate sustainable and inclusive \ninfrastructure and industrial development. It will create pathways for skills progression and \nmobility between technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and higher education \nthrough the establishment of a skill university and will raise skill levels to enhance the productivity \nand competitiveness of industries in Assam. The project will enhance skills and employability of \nyouth and adults, especially women and those from disadvantaged groups, and improve their \nprospect  of  getting  higher-paying,  decent  jobs.  The  project  will  form  part  of  the  strategic \nengagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with the Government of Assam for economic \ncorridor development, environmental sustainability, and climate change. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \n  Rationale \n \n3.  Assam is the largest state in the North Eastern Region of India in terms of economy and \npopulation and occupies a strategic position for various regional cooperation programs in South \nAsia and Southeast Asia.2 Assam\u2019s economy registered high growth rates from fiscal year (FY) \n2016 to FY2019 (12.7% on average) and contributed to 61.2% of the region\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in FY2019. Despite its abundant natural resources and higher proportion of young \npopulation (under 40 years of age) than the rest of India, Assam has yet to unleash its growth \npotential. In FY2019, the state\u2019s GDP per capita (\u20b992,533) was about two-thirds of India\u2019s GDP \nper capita.3 The structure of the economy has been slow to change, with the primary sector \n(agriculture and mining) still accounting for 27.8% of the state\u2019s GDP in FY2019.4 Assam is \nlandlocked  and  largely  rural,  and  has  underdeveloped  infrastructure,  and  its  economy  is \ndominated by low value-added, natural resource-based products and is poorly integrated with \nregional  and  global  value  chains.  Its  manufacturing  sectors  are  undiversified  and  small, \naccounting for 12.3% of the state\u2019s GDP in FY2019, which was less than the national share of \n16.1%.  Studies  conducted  by  ADB  indicate  that  aggressive  infrastructure  and  industrial \ndevelopment\u2014specifically corridor-based industrial development\u2014is necessary for Assam to \ngrow its economy. However, they identify limited availability of a skilled workforce as one of the \nkey constraints to this strategy.5 \n \n \n1  Of which (i) $150,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund, and (ii) $1 million will be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n2  For example, the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n3  India\u2019s GDP per capita was \u20b9142,964 in FY2019. \n4  The secondary sector accounted for 23.7% and the tertiary sector accounted for 46.6% of the state\u2019s GDP in FY2019. \n5  ADB. 2021. Assam as India\u2019s Gateway to ASEAN. Manila; and ADB. 2021. North East Economic Corridor: Bringing \nPeople and Markets Together. Presentation prepared for the virtual workshops on North East Economic Corridor \nstudy organized in collaboration with the Government of India\u2019s Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal \nTrade. 20 April; 18, 25 and 30 June; and 5 July 2021. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Assam was home to about 24.8 million people aged 15 years and above (49% women) in \n2018, of whom more than 11.4 million (46%) were in the labor force (84% in rural areas), and 10.6 \nmillion (93% of the labor force) were employed.6 The share of nonfarm employment grew steadily, \nfrom 32% in 2005 to 44% in 2012, and to 77% in 2018.7 Gender disparities in Assam\u2019s labor force \nare stark: as of 2018, the labor force participation rate for women was 13% compared to 78% for \nmen, the unemployment rate was 27% for women compared to 4% for men, and 30% of women \nwere in farm employment compared to 22% of men. \n \n5.  Fewer prospects for socioeconomic development have propelled out-migration for jobs \nand education, further exacerbating shortages of skills for manufacturing and services. Assam is \nprone to natural hazards such as cyclonic storms and floods, which are likely to intensify because \nof climate change. The incidence of poverty remains higher than the national average and has \nworsened  amid  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.8  Moreover,  educational \nattainment was lower than the national average in 2018: 82% of the population aged 15 years \nand above received education only up to grade 10 and below, or did not receive education at all \n(84% of women and 79% of men), while 13% attained grades 11\u201312 (11% of women and 26% of \nmen), and barely 5% completed higher education (4% of women and 6% of men, footnote 6).  \nTVET and higher education in Assam are undersupplied: as of FY2019 there was 1 industrial \ntraining institute (ITI) per 1 million population (compared to 11 in India); 15 colleges per 100,000 \npopulation aged 18\u201323 (compared to 28 in India); and 18.7% gross enrollment ratio in higher \neducation for the population aged 18\u201323 (compared to 26.3% in India), 18.3% for the female \npopulation (compared to 26.4% in India), and 19.1% for the male population (compared to 26.3% \nin India).9 The lack of supply is exacerbated by the inability of TVET and higher education \ninstitutions to operate to their full capacity and accept all qualified students (para. 7).9 \n \n6.  Lack of pathways for progression and mobility. The TVET and higher education \nsystems in Assam do not provide pathways for progression and mobility. In FY2019, the systems \ncomprised (i) 36 ITIs offering courses leading to the National Skills Qualification Framework \n(NSQF) levels 3\u20135 certificates (4,656 students enrolled), (ii) 23 polytechnics offering diploma \ncourses (7,397 students enrolled), (iii) 46 engineering colleges offering engineering degree \nprograms (9,970 students enrolled), and (iv) 544 colleges and 22 universities offering diplomas \nand academic degree programs (510,651 students enrolled in colleges and 138,880 students \nenrolled in universities).10 More than 10 academic colleges and universities also offer programs \nleading to NSQF level 7 bachelor of vocation degrees and NSQF level 9 master of vocation \ndegrees, but the uptake of these programs has been minimal, without pathways between different \ntypes of institutions. ITIs and polytechnics are generally perceived by youth as less attractive \noptions than degree-granting engineering and academic institutions because few opportunities \nare available for graduates from ITIs and polytechnics for upskilling and further study. Graduates \n \n6  The labor force includes those who are working, willing to work, or actively looking for work. National Skill \nDevelopment Corporation. 2019. Estimating the Skill Stock in Assam.

This was also the case with polytechnics (77.1%) and \nengineering colleges (50.0%). \n10 Sex-disaggregated data are available only for the state government ITIs, polytechnics, and engineering colleges. In \nFY2019, the percentage of female students was 26.6% in the state government ITIs, 19.5% in the state government \npolytechnics, and 26.1% in the state government engineering colleges. \n \n ", "3 \nfrom engineering and academic institutions, on the other hand, have limited opportunities for \nemployment-oriented skills development. \n \n7.  Issues with access, quality, and relevance. The limited supply of TVET and higher \neducation, compounded with other issues, has constrained access to TVET and higher education \nin Assam. Major challenges in improving access to TVET and higher education include (i) high \nvacancy rates and lack of competencies among trainers and faculty members; (ii) outdated \ncourses and programs, curricula, equipment, and facilities, which have little industry relevance; \nand (iii) gender stereotyping of jobs and courses, which discourages women. Moreover, lack of \nemployability is common among graduates from ITIs and polytechnics, as well as those from \ndegree-granting engineering and academic institutions. In FY2019, the employment rate for \ngraduates from polytechnics and engineering colleges who obtained qualifications was about \n32%\u201334%, while that for graduates from ITIs was slightly more than 50%.11 Despite higher \ndemands by employers for engineering, computer applications, and science degree holders, their \nemployability remains an issue.12 The reasons are overly theory-based courses, limited industry \nexposure of faculty and students, and lack of career counseling for students on job search.13 \n \n8.  Inadequate training systems for trainers and faculty. Although competent trainers and \nfaculty members are crucial to ensuring the quality and relevance of TVET and higher education, \nadequate pre-service and in-service training systems are not in place. For instance, while the \nDirectorate General of Training under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship \nrequires all ITI trainers to obtain a National Craft Instructor Certificate at the Directorate General \nof Training\u2019s national skill training institutes (NSTIs), there is no NSTI in Assam. Since ITIs are \nusually unwilling to send trainers to NSTIs in other states because of trainer shortages, many in-\nservice ITI trainers in Assam do not hold a National Craft Instructor Certificate. Moreover, the \ncapacity of NSTIs is limited. Training facilities are often outdated and disconnected from industry \nneeds. In-service training conducted by NSTIs is not standardized in terms of its content and \nfrequency,  and  the  number  and  capability  of  master  trainers.  Courses  on  technical  and \npedagogical skills, and management and leadership skills are not always available. Training \nmaterials are poorly designed (with a focus on theory) and are not suitable for practical training \nor interactive learning. The use of digital technologies and industry exposure is limited. \n \n9.  Skill universities. Against this background, the National Policy for Skill Development and \nEntrepreneurship 2015 envisaged the establishment of \u201cskill universities.\u201d14 Skill universities are \nintended to offer industry-aligned skills education and training programs with multiple entry and \nexit options leading to NSQF level 4 qualifications and above. They are integrated with higher \neducation to create pathways for progression and mobility. They are also expected to conduct \nindustry-relevant applied research and development (R&D), train trainers and faculty of ITIs and \npolytechnics, and promote quality and industry relevance of training courses provided by various \ninstitutions as a hub. The concept of skill universities anticipates the reform of the higher education \nsystem, laid out in the National Education Policy 2020, into a multidisciplinary and flexible system \nwith multiple entry and exit points by integrating professional education and TVET.15 Since about \n2017, several skill universities have emerged, adopting various operating models. However, at \nleast a few more years would be required to examine which models have worked. \n \n11 All India Council for Technical Education.

In September 2020, the Assam Legislative Assembly passed the \nAssam Skill University Act to establish Assam Skill University (ASU) in accordance with the \nregulations of the Government of India\u2019s University Grants Commission. The Government of \nAssam envisages ASU to (i) distinguish itself as a premium institution with its campus equipped \nwith state-of-the-art facilities and technologies; (ii) conduct skills education and training integrated \nwith higher education, applied R&D, entrepreneurship education and support; and (iii) raise skill \nlevels to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of industries in Assam and the North \nEastern Region. The state government also expects ASU to cater for the needs of students; TVET \nand higher education institutions; and industries in neighboring countries, which face similar \nchallenges  in  skills  education  and  training,  and  with  which  the  state  has  long-standing \nrelationships. ASU will be in Mangaldoi (Darrang district), located about 74 kilometers east of \nGuwahati, and falling within 25 kilometers of National Highway 27 connecting Guwahati with other \nmajor cities in Assam. National Highway 27 is integrated with other modes of transport (airways, \nwaterways, and railways) and provides important connectivity to neighboring states and countries. \n \n11.  An in-depth skills gap analysis conducted for the project indicates growing demand for \nhigher-level  skills  in  the  following  industries  in  Assam:  agriculture  and  food  production; \nautomotive;  construction;  creative  industries;  electronics;  energy,  including  renewable  and \nalternative energy; health care; information technology; and tourism and wellness.16 Based on the \nskills gap analysis and considering planned and ongoing major infrastructure projects in Assam \n(e.g., hydropower and multimodal logistics parks); various ADB studies (footnote 5);17 and Indian, \nregional, and global skills studies which examine the impact of the COVID-19 on jobs and skills \ndemand, nine faculties have been identified to form part of ASU: (i) agricultural and food \ntechnology; (ii) technology; (iii) design and creativity; (iv) manufacturing and construction; (v) \nsustainability; (vi) mobility; (vii) management and finance; (viii) tourism, hospitality, and wellness; \nand (ix) health care. ASU will also support the development of entrepreneurial and transversal \nskills  for  all  ages  at  additional  faculties  of  entrepreneurship  and  innovation,  life  skills  and \nlanguages, lifelong learning, and curriculum and faculty development. \n \n12.  Strategic alignment. The project is aligned with one of the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022\u2014boosting economic competitiveness to create \nmore and better jobs by addressing the skills gap to support industrialization.18 It will also support \nthe following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities and accelerating progress in gender equality by improving access to skills \neducation and training integrated with higher education to ensure pathways for progression and \nmobility, especially for female students; (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability  by  adopting  climate  mitigation  and \nadaptation measures; (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity by integrating \ndigital technologies in-service delivery; and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration by \nsupporting partnerships between ASU and institutions, and industries in neighboring countries. \n \n13.  Lessons. The project is built on the experience of ADB and other development partners \nin supporting infrastructure and industrial development, and TVET and higher education in India \nand around the world. Lessons have been reflected in the project, including the importance of (i) \n \n16 KPMG Advisory Services Private Limited. 2020. Micro-Level Skill Gap Study for the State of Assam.

The project will support the establishment \nof a faculty of entrepreneurship and innovation, which will (i) develop and manage networks of \nindustry partners, alumni, business support, and funding organizations through an office of \nindustry engagement and commercial ventures; (ii) provide support for the other faculties to \ndeliver entrepreneurship education and support; (iii) manage incubator facilities and programs; \n(iv) manage joint and contract R&D, consultancy, and technology transfer for industry partners; \nand (v) provide support for the other faculties to develop, manage, and operate R&D facilities. A \ndigital platform for entrepreneurship education and support, applied R&D projects, and technology \ntransfer will be developed. Feasibility studies for the establishment of industry-specific technology \nservices,  R&D,  testing,  and  certification  facilities  in  collaboration  with  industry  and  other \ninstitutions to promote digital and green transformation will also be supported. \n \n19.  Output 5: Access to professional development and quality skills education and \ntraining resources improved. Drawing on the systems, resources, and networks developed \nacross different faculties at ASU, the project will support ASU to establish itself as a hub for (i) \nprofessional development and quality skills education and training resources for trainers and \nfaculty of ITIs and polytechnics, and (ii) partnerships with TVET and higher education institutions \nin neighboring countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal). The project will support the \nestablishment of a faculty of curriculum and faculty development, which will (i) conduct research \non instruction, training, curricula, and assessment; (ii) support professional development of ASU\u2019s \nfaculty and staff; (iii) deliver pre- and in-service training programs for trainers and faculty of ITIs \nand polytechnics; and (iv) disseminate state-of-the-art curricula, instructional and assessment \nstrategies and approaches, and training materials. A digital platform to manage professional \ndevelopment of trainers and faculty of ITIs and polytechnics will be developed. Further, the project \nwill assist ASU in forming partnerships with TVET and higher education institutions in neighboring \ncountries and developing skills education and training programs for common strategic industries, \nleveraging ASU\u2019s locational advantage at the center of various regional cooperation programs. \n \n  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s studies and experiences in the North Eastern Region have informed the project \ndesign. ADB will bring expertise to (i) develop ASU\u2019s management and operating systems and \nbusiness models, (ii) design environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient ASU campus and \nfacilities  equipped  with  state-of-the-art  technologies,  (iii)  develop  cutting-edge  digital  skills \nprograms and services to support digital and green transformation across industries, and (iv) \nfoster partnerships with leading institutional and industry partners. ADB is the secretariat and lead \nfinancier of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program and also supports similar \nproject-based regional cooperation initiatives in South Asia. \n \n  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.

The Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department (SEED) of the Government of \nAssam will be the executing agency, and the Assam Skill Development Mission (ASDM) will be \nthe implementing agency.24 The SEED will establish a project governing committee to provide \noverall policy direction and guidance for project implementation, and a project steering committee \nto  oversee  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  ASDM  has  established  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will be responsible for day-to-day management of the project. Two \nsenior officials of ASU will be included in the PMU. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2021\u2013June 2027 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Project governing committee \nMinister of Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department (chair) \nMinisters of the departments of industry, agriculture, land and revenue, information \ntechnology, health, planning and finance, handloom and textile, tourism, transformation \nand development, education, public works, and social justice and empowerment; and \nthe vice chancellor of ASU (members) \n \nProject steering committee \nSecretary of Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department (chair) \nSecretaries of the departments; and vice chancellor of ASU (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Assam Skill Development Mission \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit, Guwahati, 12 staff; 2 senior officials from ASU \nProcurement  OCB (internationally advertised)  1 contract  $42.00 million \nOCB (nationally advertised)  47 contracts  $39.62 million \nRequest for quotations  6 contracts  $0.33 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  766 person-months  $5.79 million \nICS  138 person-months  $2.00 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will apply to six contracts: (i) boundary wall for the ASU campus \nadvance contracting  site, (ii) detailed design and construction of the ASU campus and facilities, (iii) project \nmanagement support, (iv) construction supervision and quality assurance, (v) ASU \nmanagement  and  operating  system  development,  and  (vi)  market  research  and \nbusiness development.

It is comprised of senior government officials. \n \n ", "9 \nFund.25 The Government of Assam will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, meeting space, information, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will have four outputs: \n(i)  environmentally  sustainable  and  climate-resilient  design  and  management  systems  for \nuniversity  campus  and  facilities  introduced;  (ii)  integrated  teaching,  learning,  and  career \ndevelopment management platform designed; (iii) skills education and training programs and \napplied R&D projects addressing infrastructure and industrial development needs in neighboring \ncountries developed; and (iv) capacity to support entrepreneurship and business startups, and \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises developed. The Climate Change Fund will assist ASU \nin  enhancing  climate  change  and  disaster  preparedness  and  integrating  climate  change \nadaptation technologies and climate change modules into skills education and training programs. \nThe SEED will be the executing agency and the ASDM will be the implementing agency.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n  Technical \n \n27.  The project will support the development of an integrated digital campus platform for ASU, \nand  other  digital  platforms.  These  platforms  will  be  developed  following  the  government\u2019s \nguidelines and regulations. Training and laboratory equipment to be installed under the project \nwill be selected in collaboration with industries and meet up-to-date industry standards. Training \nof those who will use and maintain the platforms and equipment has been incorporated into the \nproject design. Digital and green technologies will be adopted to the extent possible. \n \n28.  The climate change impact is medium (footnote 23). Key climate mitigation measures \ninclude insulation of buildings, heat-resistant tiles on rooftops, centralized water-cooled chiller \nsystems, and green building certification. Climate adaptation measures include cyclone-resistant \nbuilding design, flood-proofing of buildings and equipment, raised plinth levels, campus road \nconnectivity and quality, water reuse and recycling systems, and early warning systems. \n \n  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Economic analysis. Major quantifiable economic benefits expected from the project are \nhigher wages and more workdays for graduates from skills education and training programs at \ndifferent NSQF levels offered by ASU. Although the project will also upskill trainers and faculty of \nITIs and polytechnics, the associated benefits are not quantified. The economic internal rate of \nreturn was calculated at 9.5%, which is above the discount rate of 9.0%.26 \n \n30.  Financial analysis. Financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the fiscal and \nproject levels since there are no revenue-generating components. The Government of Assam\u2019s \nrecent and projected budgets and counterpart funding for the project, and the ASU operating \ncosts were analyzed to evaluate the fiscal impact of the project. The analysis concluded that the \ngovernment  has  adequate  financial  capacity  to  provide  counterpart  funding  and  the  ASU \noperating costs, which represent insignificant shares of the government\u2019s projected budgets.27 \n \n  Sustainability \n \n \n25 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \n31.  The project outcome and outputs will be sustained by establishing the foundations for \nsustainable operation of ASU, including the development of business and financial models. \nClimate, disaster, and pandemic resilience will be built into the ASU\u2019s campus and facilities and \noperating and management systems. To promote sustainable industry engagement, the project \nwill support the establishment and capacity building of the office of industry engagement and \ncommercial ventures. Sustainable partnerships with institutions in neighboring countries will be \ndeveloped through the establishment and capacity building of the international partnership office. \n \n  Governance \n \n32.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because the ASDM has no \nexperience with implementing projects financed by international financial institutions (IFIs); its \ninternal audit is not yet functional and its financial management and internal audit staff are \nunfamiliar with ADB\u2019s procedures and requirements. Key risk mitigation measures include (i) \npreparation of quarterly financial report and project financial statement templates and a financial \nmanagement manual, (ii) appointment to the PMU of a full-time finance manager with experience \nin IFI projects and an accountant, (iii) training of management and financial staff at the ASDM and \nPMU, and (iv) recruitment of experienced project management consultants to support the PMU. \n \n33.  Strategic  procurement  planning  was  undertaken  to  identify  procurement  risks  and \nmitigating measures, and fit-for-purpose procurement arrangements. The procurement risk is \nmedium mainly because of the ASDM\u2019s limited experience. The risk will be mitigated by (i) \nappointment to the PMU of full-time procurement managers with experience in IFI projects and a \ncivil engineer experienced in large and complex civil engineering projects, and (ii) recruitment of \nexperienced project management consultants to support  the PMU. All procurement will be \nconducted by the ASDM with the support of the PMU. Value for money will be achieved through \nadvance procurement, and the grouping of procurement items into large packages. \n \n34.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence on the ASDM and the members of its governing \ncouncil and executive committee.28 They do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially \nsignificant  integrity  risk.  ADB  has  obtained  reasonable  assurance that  the  ASDM  was  not \nestablished and is not being used for money laundering or terrorism financing in the project \njurisdiction. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the Government of India, the Government of Assam, and the ASDM. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n35.  As of 2013, the poverty headcount ratio was 37.1% in Assam compared to 21.9% in the \nrest of India. TVET and higher education are also undersupplied, compared to the national \naverage. Youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to drop out from secondary \neducation, which largely accounts for the lower educational attainment in the state. The ASU \ncampus will be in Darrang district, where the incidence of poverty as of 2013 (45.5%) was the \nhighest of all districts in Assam. The project will benefit youth and adults in Assam by improving \naccess to industry-aligned skills education and training, and entrepreneurship education and \nsupport, thereby enhancing their skills and chances of getting better employment and incomes. \nDropouts from senior secondary education will be admitted to ASU. The government will provide \nsubsidies for students to make tuition fees affordable. The tuition fees will be set following existing \n \n28  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n \n ", "11 \nstandards as part of business and financial models to be developed by 2024. The project will also \nbenefit local communities around the ASU campus by providing various business opportunities. \n \n36.  The project is categorized gender equity theme. Gender analysis revealed that (i) women \nare less likely to be in the labor force, are more likely to be unemployed, and earn less than men; \n(ii) girls are more likely to drop out from secondary education than boys; (iii) the proportion of \nfemale students in ITIs, polytechnics, and engineering and academic colleges and universities is \nlower; and (iv) there are fewer female trainers and faculty members at ITIs, polytechnics, and \ncolleges  and  universities,  and  they  enjoy  fewer  opportunities  for  training,  promotion,  and \nmanagerial  responsibilities.29  A  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  has  been \nprepared with actions to counter gender stereotypes and address the needs of women, people \nwith disabilities, and other disadvantaged groups.30 \n \n  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \n38.  Environment  (category  B).  Environmental  impacts  of  civil  works  are  likely  to  be \ninsignificant. Potential impacts include dust, noise, and soil runoff; temporary traffic disturbances; \nhealth and safety risks to the community and workers during construction; and wastewater and \nsolid waste generated during construction and operation. The initial environmental examination \nreports have been disclosed on the ADB website.32 Contractors will develop a health and safety \nplan that includes COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Potentially affected persons were consulted, \nand their concerns will be addressed through the implementation of environmental management \nplans. The ASDM will establish a grievance redress mechanism. The ASDM\u2019s environmental \nmanagement  capacity  has  been  developed  and  will  be  strengthened  during  project \nimplementation. The ASDM will submit to ADB semiannual environmental monitoring reports \nduring pre-construction and construction, and annual monitoring reports during operation. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that no land will be \nacquired permanently or temporarily from a person, household, business, or community; and that \nall civil works will take place on the government-owned land allotted for ASU and free from \nencumbrance. Any portion of the land that would trigger involuntary resettlement will be excluded. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category B). According to the 2011 census, Assam was home to \n3.88 million scheduled tribe people who accounted for 12.4% of the total population. The project \nis not expected to cause adverse impacts on the scheduled tribe population. Scheduled tribe \nyouth and adults will have access to skills education and training, which will enhance their \nprospect  of  getting  higher-paying,  decent  jobs.  Findings  from  consultations  have  been \nincorporated into the project design. The ASDM\u2019s capacity to manage indigenous peoples \nsafeguards is adequate and will be enhanced during project implementation. An indigenous \npeoples plan with measures to improve access to skills education and training as well as career \ndevelopment services has been disclosed on the ADB website.33 \n \n29  In FY2019, the proportion of female faculty members was 22.8% for the highest academic rank (professors and \nequivalent) and was higher for lower academic ranks (36.5% for associate professors, 41.8% for assistant professors, \nand 54.9% for temporary teachers) (footnote 10). \n30  Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  ADB.
