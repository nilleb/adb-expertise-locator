An \ninitial environmental examination was completed for the category \nB  project.  An  environmental  assessment  review  framework  was \ncompleted \nto  guide  candidate  subprojects.  No  category  A \nsubprojects will be financed. \n \nThe Power Sector Expansion Project comprises (i) support to the \nElectric  Power  Corporation\u2019s  (EPC)  investment  plan  2008\u20132015 \nthrough three investment components and a project management \ncomponent,  and  (ii)  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  for \nImplementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n \ninvestment  plan  2008\u20132015  comprises  a  series  of \nEPC\u2019s \nindividual  subproject \nin  power  generation  and \ntransmission.  The  three  investment  components  comprise  (i) \nComponent  A,  consisting  of \nthe  stage  1  expansion  and \nunderground  cabling  of  the  Hospital  Feeder  which  forms  part  of \nEPC\u2019s underground cabling program for the transmission network \nto provide protection from cyclones, (ii) Component B, consisting \nof \nthree-phase \nprepayment meters to improve EPC\u2019s collection performance and \nlay  the  foundation  for  effective  demand-side  management,  and \n(iii)  Component  C,  consisting  of  17  candidate  subprojects \nincluding  11  transmission  projects,  four  generation  projects,  a \nsystem control and data acquisition project, and voltage, current, \nand  stream-flow-gauging  measurement  equipment.  The  project \nmanagement  component \nthe \nrecruitment of a project manager and implementation consultants \nto build capacity and help implement EPC\u2019s investment plan.  \n \nReliable power supply is essential for enhancing the quality of life \nof  all  Samoans.  Good  performance  of  the  power  sector  and \nreliable  electricity  services  are  vital  for  promoting  private  sector \ninvestments  to  diversify  the  economy  and  achieve  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  The  performance  of  the  power  sector  is \nincreasingly  becoming  a  hindrance  to  economic  growth.  High \nsystem  losses  and  voltage  drops  have  resulted  in  poor  reliability \nand  quality  of  electricity  supply.  As  a  consequence,  consumers \nare resorting to more expensive self-generation. \n\n(Component  D)  comprises \n\ninstallation  of  single-  and \n\nthe  supply  and \n\ninvestments \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n  \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nWith  peak  demand  growing  at  about  3%  annually  in  the medium \nterm, EPC\u2019s challenge is to improve its operational efficiency and \nfinancial  performance  while  ensuring  sufficient  generation  and \ntransmission  capacity  is  available  to  provide  a  reliable  and  high \nquality electricity supply.  \n \nEPC\u2019s  investment  plan  2008\u20132015  is  driven  by  (i)  the  need  to \nimprove  EPC\u2019s  collection  performance,  (ii)  the  need  to  remove \ntransmission  bottlenecks  to  improve  reliability  and  quality  of \nsupply,  and  (iii)  capacity  requirements  to  meet  growing  peak \ndemands.  In  the  longer  term,  the  objective  is  to  reduce  Samoa\u2019s \nreliance  on  imported  fuels  by  promoting  clean,  indigenous,  and \nrenewable energy resources. \n \nAlthough  Samoa\u2019s  debt  situation  has  significantly  improved,  the \neconomy  remains  import-dependent  and  vulnerable  to  climatic \nand  global  price  shocks.  The  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \ngrant  to  the  Government  will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of \nthe large financing requirements in the power sector. \n \nThe  Project  forms  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector \ndevelopment plan to improve the capacity of the sector to provide \nsustainable  and  reliable  electricity  services  to  all  consumers  at \naffordable  prices.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Project  will  help \nEPC  to  improve  the  quality,  reliability,  and  cost-effectiveness  of \npower  supply  by  (i)  supporting  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan  to  meet \ngrowing demand, (ii) improving the operational efficiency of EPC, \n(iii)  improving  the  financial  performance  of  EPC,  (iv)  establishing \neffective regulation of the power sector, (v) developing a demand-\nside  management  strategy  to  promote  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation, and (vi) developing clean energy resources through \nthe  establishment  of  a  clean  energy  fund  (CEF),  a  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  subfund,  and  a  designated \nnational authority (DNA).  \n \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $100 million, including \ntaxes and duties of $2.23 million.  \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank ADF Loan \nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nGovernment of Australia \nElectric Power Corporation \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n26.61 \n15.39 \n38.00 \n8.00 \n12.00 \n\n% \n26.61\n15.39\n38.00\n8.00\n12.00\n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n100.00 \n\n100.00\n\n     ADF = Asian Development Fund.  \n     Source: Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nAn ADF loan of $26.61 million and an ADF grant of $15.39 million \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  will  help  finance  the  Project. \nThe ADF loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof  8  years,  and  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  financing  and  project  agreements.  The  ADF  grant  to  the \nGovernment  will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large \nfinancing requirements in the power sector.  \n \nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will provide \ncofinancing  of  $38  million  equivalent  in  Japanese  yen,  to  be \nadministered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  for  the \nProject. The loan is expected to have a 30-year term, including a \ngrace period of 10 years, at an interest rate of 0.45%.  \n \nThe Government of Australia will provide grant  cofinancing of $8 \nmillion.  The  grant  is  to  be  administered  by  ADB  and  is  to  be \nprovided as Government of Samoa equity to EPC for counterpart \nfinancing of the Project, with terms and conditions set forth in the \nfinancing and subsidiary financing agreements.   \n \nThe ADF loan, the ADF grant, and the JBIC loan will be relent by \nthe  Government  to  EPC.  The  relending  will  be  based  on  such \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  subsidiary  financing \nagreement  between the Government and EPC.  Such terms and \nconditions  will  include  the  relending  to  be  released  in  two \ntranches, an interest rate of 6.5%, and such conditions set forth in \nthe  financing  agreement.  The  first  tranche,  which  will  finance \nsubprojects completed by 30 June 2012, will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace of period of 5 years. The second tranche, which \nwill  finance  the  remaining  subprojects,  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. \n \nThe Government will utilize the ADF grant by converting a portion \nof  the  EPC  loan  principal  to  grants  conditional  on  timely  and \nwithin-budget \ninterest \npayment  from  EPC  to  the  Government  on  the  ADF  grant  will \nprovide  ongoing  financing  for  a  CEF  and  a  CDM  subfund  to  be \nestablished under the CEF. \n \n31 December 2016 \n \n30 June 2016 \n\nimplementation  of  subprojects.

Bid \ndocuments  for  core  subprojects  are  under  preparation  such  that \ncontracts can be awarded prior to loan effectiveness. Construction \nactivities are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2008. \n \nThe  eligibility  criteria,  project  preparation  requirements,  and \napproval  process \nfor  candidate  subprojects  have  been \nestablished.  \n \nThe Ministry of Finance  \n \nProcurement  under \nfor  ADB,  JBIC, \nGovernment  of  Australia,  and  EPC  financing,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nADB\u2019s  standard  bid  documents  will  be  used  for  procuring  ADB, \nJBIC, and Government of Australia financed goods and services. \nRequirement of environmental monitoring and management plans \nwill  be  reflected  in  all  civil  works  bid  and  contract  documents.  A \nprocurement  plan  and  tentative  contract  packages  have  been \nprepared.  International  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  apply \nto  major  contracts  for  all  subprojects.  Shopping  procedure  will \napply to contract packages of less than $100,000.    \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  a  project  manager  and \nproject implementation. Consultants will be selected and engaged \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A project manager will be \nrecruited internationally as an individual for an initial period of 36 \nmonths in accordance with ADB procedures. \n \nA consultant firm will be engaged to provide 69 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  over  a  period  of  36  months  for \nproject  implementation.  The  firm  will  be  recruited  using  quality-\nand  cost-based  selection  procedures.  Individual  consultants  may \nbe  recruited  for  specific  assignments  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures.   \n \nInadequate  and  unreliable  power  supply \nis  becoming  an \nincreasing  hindrance  to  economic  growth  and  is  affecting  all \nconsumers  in  Samoa.  The  Project  will  help  improve  the  quality \nand  reliability  of  electricity  services,  meet  growing  demand,  and \nreduce EPC\u2019s (and ultimately consumers\u2019) exposure to fluctuating \ninternational  fuel  prices.  Improvements  in  EPC\u2019s  financial  and \noperational performance will enhance cost-effectiveness of power \nsupply  and,  once  the  benefits  of  the  expansion  program  are \nrealized, reduce requirements for tariff increases.  \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nlarge \n\nsector \n\nimpact  of \n\nparticipation \n\nthe  macroeconomic \n\nRegulatory  reform  and  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  agency \nwill  help  balance  the  interests  of  all  sector  stakeholders  and \npromote \nand \nprivate \ncost-effective \ntransparency in the power sector.   \n \nEPC\u2019s  investment  plan  and  financing  arrangements  have  been \nprepared  considering  the  impact  on  Samoa\u2019s  debt  and  EPC\u2019s \nability  to  service  its  debt  to  the  Government.  The  ADF  grant  will \nfinancing \nease \nrequirements  in  the  power  sector.  The  Government  of  Australia \nwill  provide  a  grant  to  be  provided  as  Government  of  Samoa \nequity to EPC. This equity will enable EPC to meet its counterpart \nfinancing requirements for the Project. \n \nPolitical  commitment  to  implementing  power  sector  reforms  is \nneeded  for  improving  the  performance  of  the  sector,  to  ensure \nthat  EPC  can  repay  its  debt  to  the  Government,  and  to  ensure \nthat  investments  translate  into  benefits  for  electricity  consumers. \nThe  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  Energy  Policy  will \nassist the Government in (i) the consultation process, (ii) drafting \nand  amending  legislation,  and  (iii)  establishing  the  regulatory \nagency.  Assurances  under  the  Project  reflect  the  key  milestones \nfor regulatory reform. \n \nthe \nThe  selection  and  sequencing  of  subprojects  under \ninvestment  plan  has  been  prepared  in  consideration  of  EPC\u2019s \nfinancial  and  implementation  capacity.  To  ensure  affordability  of \nthe investment plan to EPC, timely adjustments to tariffs need to \nbe  made  in  response  to  changes  in  EPC\u2019s  costs.  Until  a  formal \ntariff  mechanism  can  be  established  within  the  context  of  the \nregulatory  framework,  the  Government  has  introduced  a  fuel \nsurcharge  that  allows  EPC  to  pass  on  fluctuating  fuel  costs.  To \naddress  EPC\u2019s  poor  collection  performance,  arrears  by \ngovernment  ministries  and  state-owned  entities  will  be  cleared \nprior  to  loan  effectiveness,  and  prepayment  metering  will  be \ninstalled for EPC\u2019s consumers. In the case of certain basic social \nservices  where  suspending  electricity  services  may  not  be \npossible,  budgetary  allocations  will  be  paid  directly  to  EPC  for \nelectricity consumption. The assurances under the Project include \nthe  provision  that  75%  of  all  consumers  will  have  prepayment \nmeters by the end of 2012. \n \nDraft  bid  documents  have  been  prepared  to  help  ensure  timely \nimplementation \nfor  core  subprojects.  Approval  of  advance \nprocurement  action  will  help  ensure  that  construction  activities \ncan  commence \ntargets. \nAdvance  recruitment  of  the  project  manager  and  implementation \nconsultants will help mitigate EPC\u2019s capacity constraints in project \npreparation  and  procurement  activities.  To  the  extent  possible, \nEPC  will  apply  plant  design,  supply,  and  install  contracts  to \nreduce the burden of coordination of construction activities.    \n\nto  meet  scheduled  commissioning \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n(i) \n\nthrough \n\nresources \n\nrenewable  energy \n\n \n \nThe  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy \nPolicy  comprises  four  components.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew  at  around  4%  per  annum,  well  above  the  average  growth  rate  of  the  Pacific  region \neconomies.  Economic  growth  is  mainly  driven  by  agriculture,  construction,  finance,  and \nbusiness services. Samoa is also benefiting from an increase in tourism. Further broadening of \neconomic  activity  and  private  sector  development  are  key  strategies  towards  sustaining \neconomic growth rates and reducing poverty. The Government\u2019s Strategy for the Development \nof  Samoa  2005\u20132007  lays  the  foundation  for  sustainable  and  broad-based  economic  growth \nsupported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for \nall  people  in  Samoa.  Ensuring  that  sufficient  power  is  available  to  meet  growing  demand  is \nessential  to  achieving  a  broader  economic  base  and  reducing  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to \nexternal shocks. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  energy  sector  in  Samoa  has  undergone  rapid  transformation  over  the  last  decade \n3. \ntowards  having  an  energy  supply  based  on  imported  petroleum  and  hydropower-generated \nelectricity.  This  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in \nincreasing demand for electricity and transportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three \nmain sources: biomass (47%), fossil fuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used \nfor  cooking,  whereas  imported  petroleum  is  used  for  transportation  and  power  generation. \nImports  of  petroleum  products  account  for  15%  of  Samoa\u2019s  total  import  expenditure.  Power \ngeneration accounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum. \n \n4. \nThe Energy Unit of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has the overall responsibility for policy \nand  strategic  planning  for  the  power  sector.  In  the  absence  of  an  electricity  act,  the  Electric \nPower Corporation (EPC) Act (1980) and the Public Bodies Act (2001) govern the power sector. \nUnder  the  provisions  of  the  EPC  Act,  the  Licensing  Committee  is  responsible  for  issuing \nlicensing for electrical works, generation, and distribution of electricity. \n \n5. \nEPC,  a  wholly  owned  government  corporation  established  in  1972,  is  vested  with  all \noperating  responsibilities  for  the  power  sector.  The  EPC  Act  (1980)  mandates  EPC  with  the \nauthority  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  throughout  Samoa.  The \nutility  operates  as  a  separate  entity  and  is  defined  as  a  public  trading  body  under  the  Public \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nBodies Act (2001), with the principal objective of operating as a commercial business. The State \nOwned Enterprise Monitoring Division is mandated with monitoring the financial performance of \nEPC. EPC is governed by a board of directors, the composition of which is specified in the EPC \nAct.  EPC  has  482  employees  and  services  about  29,800  consumers  throughout  Samoa.  With \nthe rural electrification program nearing completion, about 95% of the population has access to \nelectricity. The average household consumption is 76 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month.  \n \n6. \nEPC\u2019s power system comprises a grid each on Upolu and Savai\u2019i islands, which together \naccount for nearly all energy sales, and small stand-alone solar and diesel generation schemes \non two isolated islands. The total installed capacity of EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), including \n24.7 MW of diesel generation. However, available and firm capacity is significantly less.  \n \nThe generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, comes from \n7. \na  mix  of  diesel  and  hydropower  stations.  The  main  power  station  on  Upolu  is  located  at \nTanugamanono  and  has  five  diesel  generation  units  with  a  combined  available  generation \ncapacity  of  17.9  MW.  One  of  the  units  is  kept  on  standby  and  is  scheduled  for  retirement  in \n2009. The load factor is about 66% and the average fuel efficiency is 4 kWh per liter (l). Of the \n12.5  MW  of  hydropower  generation  capacity,  6.7  MW  is  firm,  and  4.0  MW  of  this comes  from \nthe  Afulilo  storage  hydropower  scheme  on  Upolu.  The  remaining  hydropower  capacity  comes \nfrom four run-of-the-river schemes on Upolu, one of which is scheduled for retirement in 2009 \nunless  refurbished.  The  run-of-the-river  hydropower  schemes  suffer  from  large  output \nreductions  during  the  dry  season,  resulting  in  significant  reductions  in  available  energy.  The \ntotal energy produced in 2006 was 101.0 gigawatt-hours (GWh).  \n \nPower  is  distributed  from  the  power  stations  via  22  kilovolts  (kV)  and  6.6  kV  radial \n8. \ntransmission lines. Along these transmission lines, transformers step the voltage down to supply \nlocal demand. The overall system losses on Upolu were estimated at 19.2% of energy produced \nin  2006.  Overloading  of  the  existing  Hospital  Feeder,  which  carries  70%  of  energy  sold  on \nUpolu, contributes significantly to the high system losses and voltage drops.  \n \n9. \nSavai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station located at Salalologa. The power station \nhas  six  secondhand  generation  units  with  a  combined  available  capacity  of  5.2  MW.  The \nestimated  load  factor  is  41%  and  the  total  energy  produced  is  11.1  GWh.  Fuel  efficiency  is \nestimated  at  3.3  kWh  per  l.  Power  is  distributed  via  22  kV  transmission  lines  with  step-down \ntransformers  and  a  low  voltage  network  to  supply  local  demand.  The  transmission  and \ndistribution system losses were estimated at 21.4% in 2006. \n \nIn 2006, peak electricity demands reached 17.6 MW on Upolu and 3.0 MW on Savai\u2019i. \n10. \n1 of 1.5 on Upolu, about 20.5 MW can be met reliably. With peak demand \nWith a peaking factor(cid:31)F\non Upolu growing by 7.3% in the very near term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW \nis  expected  in  2008.  By  2011,  this  shortfall  will  have  increased  to  5  MW  unless  additional \ngeneration  capacity  is  installed.  In  terms  of  annual  energy,  the  existing  capacity  can  meet \nrequirements  until  2013  when  a  1.3  GWh  shortfall  is  predicted.  This  shortfall  will  increase  to \n25.7 GWh by 2020. Some of the existing capacity from self-generation (estimated to be about 8 \nMW)  could  be  used  to  reduce  peak  system  requirements  in  the  short  term.  On  Savai\u2019i,  the \nexisting  diesel  power  station  is  estimated  to  meet  capacity  and  annual  energy  requirements \nassuming appropriate operations and maintenance of the existing generation units. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Calculated as peak power demand divided by average power demand. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n   \n\nAn  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  was  approved  in  2001  but  has  never  been \n11. \nimplemented.  Instead,  tariff  submissions  are  made  to  cabinet,  which  regulates  and  approves \nelectricity  tariffs.  Before  the  15%  increase  in  May  2005,  tariffs  had  remained  constant  since \n2001.  A  simplified  tariff  structure,  which  became  effective  in  February  2007,  allows  for  a  fuel \nsurcharge  of  15%,  subject  to  review  by  cabinet  every  6  months.  For  2007  this  implies  a  14% \nincrease  in  average  tariffs.  The  highest  tariff  category  for  domestic  consumers  has  been \nabolished and a single tariff applies to all nondomestic consumers. The average tariff for 2007 is \nestimated  at  ST0.712  ($0.26)  per  kWh  overall  and  ST0.62  ($0.23)  per  kWh  for  domestic \nconsumers. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nPower Sector Priorities \n\n12. \nThe  overarching  goal  for  the  power  sector  is  to  provide  sustainable  and  reliable \nelectricity services to all consumers at affordable prices. Developing indigenous and renewable \nenergy resources to reduce the economy\u2019s risk exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and \nfuel price increases is a high development priority for Samoa and is articulated in the Strategy \nfor  the  Development  of  Samoa.  Consistent  with  this  goal,  the  Samoa  National  Energy  Policy \n(2007) identifies the development of renewable energy resources and the promotion of energy \nefficiency  and  conservation  for  end  users  as  vital  to  achieving  a  sustainable  energy  sector. \nLikewise,  EPC\u2019s  Corporate  Plan  2007  identifies  the  provision  of  reliable  and  affordable \nelectricity services as the vision for the corporation, and the development of renewable energy \nresources  as  a  key  longer-term  objective.  Development  of  hydropower  and  other  renewable \nresources  will  help  to  replace  fuel-generated  power  and  reduce  EPC\u2019s  exposure  to  foreign \nexchange fluctuations and fuel price increases. The power sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  While  the  development  of  indigenous  and  renewable  energy  sources  is  important  for \nrealizing  the  priorities  for  the  energy  sector,  socially  acceptable,  technically  feasible,  and \naffordable  renewable  energy  resources  for  power  generation  are  limited  in  Samoa.  Recent \nexperience  from  a  consultation  process  for  hydropower  development  on  Savai\u2019i  shows  that \ncommunity  concerns  and,  sometimes,  misconceptions  of  the  impacts,  can  be  a  constraining \nfactor.  With  the  transport  sector  absorbing  80%  of  imported  petroleum,  it  is  evident  that \nmeasures for energy conservation and development of alternative energy resources must cover \nthe energy sector as a whole. To address the priorities for the energy sector, the Government \nwill establish a clean energy fund (CEF) and a designated national authority (DNA) to promote \nrenewable  energy  development  and  energy  conservation,  and  examine  policy  measures  in \nsupport of energy conservation covering the energy sector as a whole.  \n \n14. \nEPC is currently utilizing existing self-generation capacity on an as-needs basis. In the \nshort  term,  EPC  plans  to  continue  to  use  self-generation  on  a  standby  basis  to  meet  peak \ndemand  requirements  during  the  dry  season.  The  priority  is  to  upgrade  the  transmission \ncapacity  to  (i)  improve  utilization  of  existing  generation  plants,  (ii)  reduce  system  losses,  (iii) \nimprove reliability and security of supply to the main industrial and commercial consumers, and \n(iv)  address  the  overloading  on  the  existing  underground  transmission  line  to  the  hospital. \nConsistent  with  the  priorities  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  National  Adaptation  Program  of \nAction (2005), EPC aims to reduce the exposure of its transmission network to cyclones through \nunderground cabling of selected transmission lines. The underground cabling program, which is \nincluded  in  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan  2008\u20132015,  comprises  five  subprojects:  (i)  the  Hospital \nFeeder upgrading project \u2013 Stage 1, (ii) Upolu diesel power station to Fuluasou Substation 22 \nkV  underground  cable  project,  (iii)  Hospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013 Stage  2,  (iv)  Fuluasou \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nSubstation to Apia Wharf area 22 kV underground cable project, and (v) Fuluasou Substation to \nLaulumauga via Vaigaga 22 kV underground cable project.  \n \n15. \nUnpredictable  long-term  financing  for  needed  investments  is  a  key  factor  constraining \nEPC\u2019s  efforts  to  move  away  from  reactive  management  to  more  proactive  planning, \nmaintenance,  and  customer  relations.  EPC  is  increasingly  placing  emphasis  on  planning,  but \nboth  technical  and  financial  capacity  for  long-term  investment  planning  is  constrained.  With \n2  EPC  developed  an  investment  plan  for  generation  and \ntechnical  assistance  from  ADB,(cid:31)F\ntransmission  investments  for  the  period  2008\u20132015.  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan,  which  considers \nthe  capacity  of  EPC  to  manage  project  implementation  and  the  affordability  of  capital \ninvestments, is detailed in Appendix 3.  \n \nIn the short term, EPC\u2019s investment requirements for generation are driven by growing \n16. \npeak  demand.  To  reduce  investment  requirements,  which  may  unduly  burden  the  utility\u2019s \nfinancial  position,  EPC  has  identified  the  need  for  demand-side  management  measures, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  bulk  power  purchase  agreements  with  large  consumers  that \nencourage  off-peak  consumption.  To  ensure  that  demand-side  management  measures  for  all \nconsumers are effective, installation of prepayment meters is included as a core subproject in \nEPC\u2019s investment plan.  \n \nAppropriate  arrangements  for  tariff  setting,  technical  regulation,  and  private  sector \n17. \nparticipation  are  becoming  increasingly  important  to  improving  the  performance  of  the  power \nsector  in  Samoa.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  the  existing  arrangements  are  a  key \ndevelopment  constraint  for  the  power  sector  and  is  considering  reforms  to  improve  the \nperformance of the sector and encourage cost-effective private sector participation. Discussions \non regulatory options for the power sector have been taking place through a TA project provided \nby  ADB  (footnote  2).  These  discussions  have  focused  on  the  need  for  an  electricity  act  to \n3 to  be \ngovern  all  stakeholders  in  the  power  sector  in  Samoa,  and  for  a  regulatory  agency(cid:31)F\nestablished  to  (i)  remove  existing  regulatory  functions  from  EPC,  (ii)  provide  appropriate \narrangements for tariff setting, and (iii) enable private sector participation to reduce public sector \ninvestment requirements and promote least-cost generation to meet growing electricity demand.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEPC\u2019s Financial Performance and Management \n\n18. \nOver  the  past  6  years,  EPC  has  struggled  to  improve  its  financial  performance  to \nsatisfactory  levels.  Due  largely  to  inadequate  tariff  levels  and  poor  collections  performance, \nEPC  has  been  unable  to  meet  its  debt  service  obligations  and  still  fund  capital  investments. \nEPC\u2019s  financial  performance  gradually  improved  up  to  FY2004,  before  weakening  again  in \nFY2005, primarily because of higher fuel prices. Although tariffs were increased by 15% in May \n2005  and  a  fuel  surcharge  was  introduced  in  February  2007,  these  were  not  sufficient  to  fully \noffset higher fuel costs. The impact of tariff increases and the fuel surcharge has been limited by \nEPC\u2019s inability to significantly improve its collections performance. The collections performance \nhas  progressively  deteriorated  over  the  past  6  years  and  is  a  major  factor  adversely  affecting \nnet cash flows. Government entities account for a disproportionate share of EPC\u2019s arrears from \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Independent State  of Samoa for Preparing the Power Sector Expansion \n\nProgram. Manila. \n\n3   The Government is considering establishing an independent regulatory agency for the power sector alone (a single \nsector regulator) or mandate a regulatory agency to cover multiple infrastructure sectors (a multisector regulator). A \nmultisector  regulator  would  expand  the  roles  and  function  of  the  existing  independent  regulator  for  the \ntelecommunications sector. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n   \n\nelectricity  sales.  While  electricity  sales  to  government  entities  account  for  11%  of  total  sales, \nthey account for 55% of existing total arrears.  \n \n19. \nTo ensure timely tariff adjustments in response to changes in EPC costs, there is a need \nto establish a formal mechanism for determining tariffs within the context of an overall regulatory \nframework for the electricity sector. This is particularly important during the growing daily peak \nin demand when EPC relies most heavily on expensive diesel generation.  \n \nOver the past 2 years, EPC has taken measures to improve its collections. It has begun \n20. \nto introduce prepayment metering and has so far installed 1,200 meters, primarily for domestic \ncustomers  and  small  businesses.  The  investment  plan  will  extend  prepayment  metering  to  all \nEPC customers, including three-phase meters for government ministries and entities and private \nsector  consumers.  In  the  case  of  government-defined  basic  social  services  (such as  hospitals \nand  health  clinics)  where  suspending  electricity  service  may  not  be  possible,  budgetary \nallocations will be paid directly to EPC for electricity consumption. EPC has begun requiring full \nupfront payment for most rechargeable works, although some exceptions to this policy remain. \nThe EPC board has also recently approved policies on consistent application of debt write-offs \nand disconnections. The financial performance and projections of EPC is in Appendix 4.  \n \n21. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  EPC\u2019s  internal  controls  and  accounting  and \naudit  procedures  was  undertaken.  EPC\u2019s  financial  management  practices  and  procedures  are \nconsidered  to  be  generally  adequate  for  both  the  construction  and  operational  phases  of  the \nProject.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  established  within  EPC  will  be  responsible  for \nproject  financial  management  and  accounting.  The  PMU  will  utilize  EPC\u2019s  existing  financial \nmanagement  and  accounting  systems  in  undertaking  these  functions.  EPC\u2019s  accounts  and \nreporting structures are based on international financial reporting standards. \n \n22. \nEPC\u2019s  financial  statements  are  audited  by  a  firm  of  external  auditors  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s Audit Office. Over the period assessed (FY2002\u2013FY2006), the auditor issued an \nunqualified opinion, meaning that the financial statements were deemed to provide a true and \nfair  view  of  the  financial  position  of  EPC.  However,  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  assessment \nidentified  certain  deficiencies  in  these  statements,  which  indicate  weaknesses  in  the  external \nauditing  process.  To  address  these  deficiencies,  resident  financial  management  advisors \n(RFMAs) will provide ongoing support for improving internal budgeting and expenditure controls, \nconsolidating  accounts,  and  financial  reporting  and  forecasts  to  the  EPC  board,  the \nGovernment, and ADB. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n23. \nADB has been involved in the power sector in Samoa since 1971 with the provision of an \ninitial TA project which was instrumental in the establishment of EPC in 1972. ADB has assisted \nthe  development  of  the  power  sector  in  Samoa  through  seven  previous  loans,  amounting  to \n$21.05  million,  and  14  TA  projects,  amounting  to  $3.013  million.  The  most  recent  loan, \n4  A  number  of  other  donors  and  multilateral \napproved  in  2001,  was  cancelled  in  2006.(cid:31)F\ndevelopment  banks  have  been  active  in  the  power  sector,  including  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  European  Investment  Bank,  Global  Environment  Facility \n(GEF),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP), and the World Bank. The external assistance to the power sector is in Appendix 5.    \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nIndependent State of Samoa for the Power Sector Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1886-SAM). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n24. \nA number of lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s support to the power sector in Samoa. \nCost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to  delays  in  implementation.  Deferred  loan \neffectiveness and technical and procurement aspects have been the major contributing factors \nto delays in project implementation. \n \nPreparation  of  accurate  cost  estimates  is  a  difficult  task  for  infrastructure  projects  in \n25. \nSamoa given the country\u2019s reliance on international markets, particularly for civil works contracts \nin Australia and New Zealand. Physical contingencies need to be sufficient to allow for technical \nuncertainties and the selection of procurement methods must consider the capacity to manage \nand coordinate contracts, and the ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n \n26. \nSamoa has experienced cost overruns on a majority of infrastructure projects funded by \nADB and the World Bank. Cost overruns in the power sector have resulted in either a reduction \nin  the  project  scope  or  a  request  for  supplementary  financing.  These  requests  have  been \nassociated  with  delays  that  have  led  to  further  cost  increases  because  of  the  need  to  extend \nbids. ADB review missions concluded that a sector loan modality would add flexibility and help \navoid delays associated with supplementary loan processing.  \n \n27. \nIn  general,  EPC  has  complied  with  covenants  related  to  ADB\u2019s  safeguards.  However, \nEPC\u2019s compliance with financial performance covenants has been very limited in prior loans. In \n2005,  ADB  undertook  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  EPC\u2019s  financial  performance  which \nconcluded that the covenants needed to be refined to achieve a strong focus on cash flows. In \naddition,  reporting  requirements  to  the  EPC  board  and  the  Government  for  covenant \ncompliance  need  to  be  in  place  to  support  desirable  outcomes.  Covenants  compliance  also \nneeds  to  be  supported by  targeted  capacity  building  to  address  identified  weaknesses  and  by \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government during implementation.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n28. \nThe unreliable and poor quality electricity supply is affecting all consumer groups and is \nbecoming  an  increasing  constraint  to  private  sector  development  and  economic  growth.  The \npower  sector  expansion  project  has  been  identified  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  overarching \nobjective of providing sustainable and reliable electricity services to all consumers at affordable \nprices. To achieve this objective, the Project will help EPC to improve the quality, reliability, and \ncost-effectiveness of power supply.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \nThe Project forms part of the Government\u2019s power sector development plan to improve \nthe capacity of the sector to meet growing electricity demand and improve quality, reliability, and \ncost-effectiveness  of  power  supply  by  (i)  supporting  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan  to  meet  growing \ndemand,  (ii)  improving  the  operational  efficiency  of  EPC,  (iii)  improving  the  financial \nperformance of EPC, (iv) establishing effective regulation of the power sector, (v) developing a \ndemand-side  management  strategy  to  promote  energy  efficiency  and  conservation;  and  (vi) \ndeveloping  clean  energy  resources  through  the  establishment  of  a  CEF,  a  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) subfund, and a DNA.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n   \n\nthe \n\n \n30. \nEPC\u2019s  investment  plan  for  2008\u20132015  will  meet  forecasted  demand  requirements  up \nuntil  2019  when  new  capacity  will  be  required  on  Upolu,  and  help  EPC  improve  its  collection \nperformance through the installation of prepayment meters. The investment plan comprises (i) \nfour generation projects, (ii) 11 transmission projects, (iii) single- and three-phase prepayment \nmetering,  (iv)  a  system  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  project,  and  (v)  portable \nequipment for measuring voltage and current and stream-flow gauging. Increased transmission \ncapacity  on  Upolu  and  the  installation  of  prepayment  meters  have  been  prioritized  to  improve \nfor  effective  demand-side \nEPC's  collection  performance  and  provide \nmanagement measures. The capacity of the transmission network will be increased to (i) reduce \nsystem losses, (ii) improve reliability and quality of supply to the main business and commercial \nload center in Apia, and (iii) reduce the load on the existing underground transmission line to the \nhospital.  EPC  will  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  its  transmission  network  through  underground \ncabling of selected transmission lines. Investments in generation are prioritized to meet growing \npeak demand and replace diesel-generated power. Increased generation capacity on Upolu will \nbe required in 2010 and a mini-hydropower project on Savai\u2019i is scheduled for commissioning in \n2014.     \n \n31. \nThe SCADA and equipment for measuring voltage and current will help EPC improve its \noperational efficiency through (i) improved system controls and monitoring, (ii) benchmarking of \nstandard industry performance indicators, and (iii) enabling targeted loss reduction measures.  \n \n32. \n \n\nThe investment comprises the following components. \n\nfoundation \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nComponent  A:  Hospital  Feeder  Upgrading  Project  \u2013  Stage  1.  The  project \nforms part of EPC\u2019s underground cabling program for the transmission network to \nprovide protection from cyclones. The project, which is the first stage of the two-\nstage upgrading and underground cabling of the Hospital Feeder, will relieve the \noverloaded  Hospital  Feeder  by  transferring  the  town  center  and  Mulinuu  Point \nbranches to the underutilized Vaitele Feeder. A 22 kV underground cable with a \nlength  of  900  meters  (m)  will  be  constructed  and  replace  the  existing  6.6  kV \ntransmission  line  overhead  section  from  Togafuafua  to  Saleufi.  The  project  will \nimprove utilization of the existing Vaitele Feeder and improve reliability of supply \nto  the  central  business  and  parliamentary  area,  and  to  the  hospital.  The \nTanugamanono Power  Station will be reinforced by installation of a new 6.6 kV \n22 kV transformer to support the 22 kV underground cable, and nine new 22 kV \n400  volts  (V)  distribution  transformers  to  replace  the  existing  6.6  kV  400  V \ntransformers. \n\nComponent B: Single- and Three-Phase Prepayment Metering Project. This \ncomponent  involves  the  supply  and  installation  of  21,000  single-phase  (10 \namperes [A]\u2013100 A);  200 three-phase prepayment meters (10 A\u2013160 A); and 50 \nthree-phase  current  transformer  prepayment  meters  (160  A\u2013800  A)    on  Upolu \nand  Savai\u2019i  commencing  in  2008.  EPC  plans  to  have  prepayment  meters  for  at \nleast 75% of its consumers installed by the end of 2012. The Project will improve \nEPC\u2019s  collection  performance  and  lay  the  foundation  for  effective  demand-side \nmanagement. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nComponent  C:  candidate  subprojects.  Candidate  subprojects comprise  three \ngeneration  and  eight  transmission  subprojects  on  Upolu  and  one  generation \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nproject  and  three  transmission  subprojects  on  Savai\u2019i.  The  SCADA  system  and \nmeasurement equipment will cover the power systems on both islands.  \n\nComponent  D:  project  management.  To  ensure  timely  implementation,  EPC \nhas established a PMU dedicated solely to the implementation of the investment \nplan.  An  externally  recruited  project  manager  and \ninternational  project \nimplementation  consultants  will  be  appointed  for  an  initial  period  of  3  years  to \nassist  the  PMU,  build  capacity,  and  coordinate  and  implement  the  investment \nplan.  \n\n \n33. \nThe investment plan is accompanied by institutional and regulatory measures to improve \nthe  financial  and  operational  performance  of  EPC,  and  the  overall  performance  of  the  power \nsector. EPC\u2019s collection performance will be improved through (i) the installation of prepayment \nmeters, (ii) consistent application of the disconnection policy, and (iii) improvements to financial \ncontrols. \n  \nThe  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy  Policy  comprises  four \n34.  \ncomponents  that  aim  to  (i)  help  improve  EPC\u2019s  financial  performance  through  the  provision  of \nRFMAs; (ii) develop a regulatory framework that will establish a regulatory agency to govern all \nstakeholders in the power sector; (iii) promote energy efficiency through the development of a \ndemand-side management and energy conservation strategy and public awareness campaign; \nand  (iv)  promote  development  of  clean  energy  through  the  establishment  of  a  CEF  and  CDM \nsubfund  and  by  assisting  the  Government  with  enabling  the  environment  for  participation  in \ncarbon-market trading through the establishment of, and capacity building for, the DNA.  \n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Fund (ADF) IX Grant Component \n\n35. \nThe  proposed  ADF  grant  of  $15.39  million  to  the  Government  will  ease  the \nmacroeconomic  impact  of  the  large  financing  requirements  for  the  power  sector  expansion \nproject. The Government will provide the grant to EPC as a loan on the same terms as the loan \nfrom ADB. The Government will utilize a portion of the grant as an incentive scheme for EPC for \ntimely  implementation  of  subprojects  under  the  investment  plan.  Upon  EPC  meeting  the \nscheduled commissioning dates for each of the subprojects, the Government will provide 7% of \nthe  project  cost  as  a  grant  to  EPC,  up  to  a  ceiling  of  $10  million  from  2008  to  2015.  Projects \ncommissioned  after  31  December  2015  will  not  be  eligible  under  the  grant  incentive  scheme. \nThe  implementation  schedule  and  commissioning  dates  for  each  of  the  candidate  subprojects \nwill be approved by the project steering committee (PSC) at subproject approval stage prior to \nimplementation.  The  grant \nin  project \nimplementation  such  that  the  benefits  of  the  investments  will  reach  electricity  consumers  in  a \ntimely manner.  \n \nD. \n\nincentive  scheme  will  help \n\nimprove  discipline \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nDonor  Coordination.  Donor  coordination  and  consultations  with  AusAID,  GEF,  and \nJBIC have been key features of project preparation. Because of the emphasis on regulatory and \ngovernance  aspects  of  the  power  sector  in  Samoa,  the  Government  of  Australia  will  help \nfinance  the  regulatory  and  policy  reform  component  of  the  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the \nSamoa National Energy Policy. Development of the feasible and affordable investment plan and \npolicy  dialogue  has  been  undertaken  with  EPC  and  the  Government  jointly  with  AusAID  and \nJBIC. JBIC will provide joint cofinancing as the first project under the Accelerated Cofinancing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n   \n\n5 The Government of Australia will provide a grant as joint cofinancing for the \nScheme with ADB.(cid:31)F\nProject to address affordability of counterpart financing requirements, which is a particular issue \nfor  EPC  in  the  early  years  of  the  investment  plan.  Initial  consultations  have  been  undertaken \nwith  GEF  on  the  CEF.  The  consultations  will  continue  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \nestablishment of the CEF, the CDM subfund, and the DNA.   \n \n37. \nClimate  Change  Adaptation.  The Project supports the objectives of the Government\u2019s \nNational  Adaptation  Program  of  Action  (2005)  through  the  underground  transmission  network \ncabling program. The program will help to reduce exposure of transmission assets to cyclones \nand reduce the impacts to EPC and consumers of cyclone damage to the transmission network. \n \n38. \nPower  Sector  Reform.  Investments  in  the  power  sector  will  be  accompanied  by \ninstitutional and regulatory reform to improve the financial and operational performance of EPC, \nand the overall performance of the power sector. Assistance to undertaking the reform process \nis  provided  through  the  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy  Policy  and  is \nsupported by assurances under the financing agreement between ADB and the Government. \n \n39.  Macroeconomic  Sustainability.  The  provision  of  the  ADF  grant  will  ease  the \nmacroeconomic  impact  of  the  large  financing  requirements  for  the  power  sector  expansion \nproject.  In  addition,  the  Government  of  Australia  will  provide  $8  million  to  the  Government  for \ncounterpart financing of the Project.(cid:31)F\n \n40. \nFinancing  Arrangements.  The  sector  loan  modality  will  help  EPC  to  improve  longer-\nterm  investment  planning  through  the  provision  of  predictable  financing.  The  sector  loan \nmodality  will  also  help  mitigate  the  risk  of  further  delays  associated  with  supplementary  loan \nprocessing  in  the  event  of  cost  overruns.  The  Government  utilization  of  a  portion  of  the  ADF \ngrant  as  an  incentive  scheme  to  EPC  will  help  improve  timely  implementation  of  subprojects. \nThe  Government  will  also  utilize  the  interest  rate  payment  from  EPC  on  the  grant  to  provide \nongoing financing of a CEF and a CDM subfund.  \n \n41. \nPilot Financing Approach to Reforms in Developing Countries. The Government of \nAustralia will provide a grant of A$4 million to the Government of Samoa to buy down a portion \nof the ADF loan. The loan buy down mechanism will be triggered by the Government achieving \nspecific  reform  measures  by  31  December  2012,  including  (i)  the  establishment  of  an \nindependent technical and price regulator for the power sector, (ii) EPC\u2019s collection performance \nimproving  such  that  accounts  receivable  do  not  exceed  2  months  of  electricity  sales  for  a \nminimum of 2 years, and (iii) 75% of all EPC\u2019s active electricity customers are using prepayment \nmeters.  The  use  of  this  pilot  mechanism  constitutes  an  innovative  approach  to  promoting \nreforms in developing countries, especially in the Pacific region. This is the first time that ADB is \nengaging in such a loan buy down mechanism. \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n6 \n\n42. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $100  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$2.23 million. The Project comprises two core investment subprojects, 17 candidate investment \nsubprojects under EPC\u2019s investment plan, and a project management component which will be \nimplemented  during  the  2008\u20132015  investment  period.  The  core  subprojects  comprise  the \n                                                 \n5   The joint cofinancing framework agreement for the Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB was signed on 26 \n\n6   The $8 million will be disbursed over the 8-year investment plan and constitute the Government of Samoa\u2019s equity \n\nSeptember 2007. \n\nin EPC. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nHospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 1, through the construction of a 22 kV underground \ncable  from  Togafuafua  to  Saleufi,  and  the  supply  and  installation  of  single-  and  three-phase \nprepayment  meters.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  financing  and  project  agreements.  The \nbeneficiary will be the Independent State of Samoa. \n \n44. \nThe Government has requested a loan of $38  million equivalent in Japanese yen from \nJBIC  for  joint  cofinancing  of  the  Project,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  loan  is  expected  to \nhave a 30-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, at an interest rate of 0.45%.   \n \n45. \nThe  ADF  loan,  the  ADF  grant,  and  the  JBIC  loan  will  be  provided  to  the  Independent \nState  of  Samoa  and  then  relent  by  the  Government  to  EPC.  The  relending  will  be  based  on \nsuch  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  subsidiary  financing  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and EPC.  Such terms and conditions will include the relending to be released in \ntwo tranches, an interest rate of 6.5%, and such conditions set forth in the financing agreement. \nThe first tranche, which will finance subprojects completed by 30 June 2012, will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years. The second tranche, which will finance the remaining \nsubprojects, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The Government will \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nassume  the  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  the  ADB  and  JBIC  loans.  ADB  and  JBIC  will \nfinance 80% of the estimated project costs. The Government of Australia will provide $8 million \nrepresenting 8% of the estimated project costs (as described more fully in paragraph 46 below). \nEPC  will  provide  $12  million  as  counterpart  financing,  which  represents  12%  of  the  estimated \nproject costs. Table 2 presents the financing plan, and the detailed cost estimates by financier \nare detailed in Appendix 6 (Table A6.2). \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nAsian Development Bank ADF Loan \nAsian Development Bank ADF Grant \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nGovernment of Australia \nElectric Power Corporation \n\nTotal \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n26.61 \n15.39 \n38.00 \n8.00 \n12.00 \n100.00 \n\n26.61 \n15.39 \n38.00 \n8.00 \n12.00 \n100.00 \n\n \n46. \nThe Government has requested a grant of $8 million from the Government of Australia to \nhelp finance the Project on a joint cofinancing basis. The grant will be provided as Government \nof Samoa equity to EPC for the purpose of meeting counterpart financing requirements of the \nProject, with terms and conditions set forth in the subsidiary financing agreement between the \nGovernment and EPC.  ADB typically seeks Board approval for the administration of grant funds \nfrom cofinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. In the case of the proposed \nGovernment of Australia grant, the cofinancing agreement between the Government of Australia \nand  ADB  will  be  entered  into  following  Board  approval  of  the  Project.  To  avoid  any  Project \ndelay, the Board is requested to approve the administration of the proposed grant, in an amount \nnot  exceeding  $8  million,  which  is  expected  to  be  confirmed  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board \napproval.  Approval  of  the  Government  of  Australia  grant  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  in \naccordance  with  the  standard  reporting  procedures.  If  the  Government  of  Australia  does  not \napprove  grant  financing,  the  Government  may  make  alternative  arrangements,  satisfactory  to \nADB, to cover the funding shortfall. \n\n \n\n47. \nThe  ADF  grant  of  $15.39  million  will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  large \nfinancing requirements for the Project. The grant will be relent to EPC on the same terms as the \nADB and JBIC loans. The interest payment from EPC to the Government on the grant portion \n7 MOF will provide annual reports \nwill provide ongoing financing for a CEF and a CDM subfund.(cid:31)F\nto  ADB  on  the  interest  payment  directed  to  the  CEF  and  CDM  subfund.  The  Government  will \nutilize  a  portion  of  the  grant  as  an  incentive  scheme  for  EPC  for  timely  implementation  of \nsubprojects under the investment plan. Seven percent of projects costs, or a maximum of $10 \nmillion of the EPC loan principal, can be converted to grants conditional on timely and to-budget \nimplementation of subprojects. MOF will report to ADB when EPC has met the conditions that \nwill trigger conversion to grants and advise of the amount of the loan principal to be converted \ninto grants to EPC. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   The TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy will assist in the establishment of a CEF and a \n\nCDM subfund.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n48.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project  and  has  assigned  EPC  as  the \n8 The chief \nimplementing agency. A PSC will be established to provide overall project direction.(cid:31)F\nexecutive  officer  (CEO)  of  MOF  will  chair  the  PSC.  Other  PSC  members  comprise  (i)  the \ngeneral manager of EPC, (ii) the attorney general, and (iii) the CEOs of the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, the  \nSamoa Water Authority, and the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour. PSC meetings will \nbe convened on a quarterly basis commencing in October 2007. Special PSC meetings may be \nconvened to consider extraordinary project issues. A project management committee (PMC) will \nbe  formed  within  EPC  to  provide  coordination  between  project  and  nonproject  activities.  The \nPMC will be chaired by the general manager and comprise EPC management and the project \nmanager. The PMC will convene on a weekly basis commencing in October 2007. \n \nEPC  will  establish  a  PMU  for  the  day-to-day  management  and  implementation  of  the \n49. \nproject. The PMU will be led by an externally recruited project manager who will be responsible \nfor  the  daily  tasks  associated  with  project  delivery  and  control.  The  project  manager  will  be \nengaged for an initial period of 3 years. The PMU will include personnel seconded from existing \nEPC  staff  resources  or  recruited  specifically  for  the  PMU.  Project  implementation  consultants \nwill be recruited to provide technical support and on-the-job training for the PMU personnel over \nthe first 3 years of the Project. The PMU will be responsible for project planning, monitoring and \nreporting,  and  cost  and  quality  control.  The  PMU  will  (i)  undertake  project  management  and \nadministration, (ii) plan and implement cost effective and sustainable infrastructure investments \nto meet consumer demand, (iii) maintain project accounts, (iv) oversee procurement procedures \nto  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  (v)  liaise  with  ADB \nfor quarterly project progress updates and other reporting and communication matters, and (vi) \nprepare  the  project  completion  report  of  the  Government.  The  Government  will  ensure  that, \nthroughout the project implementation period, EPC provides adequate allocations of counterpart \nfunds to ensure proper project implementation. EPC will provide adequate office space for the \nPMU  and  implementation  consultants  and  ensure  that  the  facilities  provided  are  operated  and \nmaintained appropriately.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCandidate Subproject Preparation and Approval \n\nPreparation. The PMU will identify candidate subprojects and obtain approval from the \n50. \nEPC  board  and  MOF  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  candidate  subprojects.  The  PMU  will \nprepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each  candidate  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  detail  and \nquality  required  to  enable  ADB  to  assess  the  suitability  of  the  candidate  subproject.  The \nfeasibility  study  will  contain  evidence  of  the  candidate  subproject\u2019s  eligibility  under  the  agreed \ncriteria.  The  feasibility  study  will  provide  (i)  technical  analysis  and  description;  (ii)  subproject \nrationale,  scope,  and  components;  (iii)  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan;  (iv)  implementation \narrangements;  (v)  an  environmental  assessment;  and  (vi)  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nassessment.  The  feasibility  studies  will  include  a  set  of  relevant  benchmark  and  performance \nindicators for the subproject which will be monitored through the progress reports. The feasibility \nstudy will also contain an update of EPC\u2019s investment plan and an analysis of the impacts on \nEPC\u2019s 5-year financial projections, key financial ratios, and compliance with loan covenants.  \n\n                                                 \n8   Similar PSCs  are being used for overall strategic  guidance and coordination for infrastructure projects funded by \n\nother international financing institutions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n51. \nEligibility  Criteria. The PSC, the EPC board, and ADB, in consultation with the PMU, \nwill  appraise  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  eligibility  criteria  and  procedures  outlined  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n52. \nApproval Process. Candidate subproject feasibility studies will be submitted to ADB for \nreview  and  approval.  After  ADB  has  endorsed  the  feasibility  study,  the  PMU  will  submit  the \nfeasibility  study  to  the  EPC  board  and  the  PSC  for  review  and  approval.  Implementation  of  a \ncandidate subproject may only proceed following the endorsement of the candidate subproject \nfeasibility  study  by  the  PSC,  the  EPC  board,  and  ADB.  Civil  works  may  only  commence  once \nthe land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) and initial environmental examinations (IEE) \nhave  been  approved  by  ADB,  and  the  development  concept  approval  of  the  Preliminary \nEnvironmental Assessment Report (PEAR) is issued by the Planning and Urban Management \nAgency (PUMA).  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n53. \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  Bid  documents  for  core \nsubprojects are under preparation such that construction activities can start in the first quarter of \n2008. The subprojects will be implemented over 8 years and are expected to be completed by \n31 December 2015. The project implementation schedule is detailed in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement  \n\nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  works  financed  by  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  and \n54. \ngrant, the JBIC loan, and the Government of Australia grant will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all contracts. ADB\u2019s \nbid  documents  will  be  used  for  procuring  ADB,  JBIC,  and  Government  of  Australia  financed \ngoods  and  services.  Requirements  of  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plans \n(EMMP)  will  be  reflected  in  all  civil  works  bid  and  contract  documents.  The  draft  procurement \nplan  outlines  (i)  the  particular  contracts  for  the  goods  and  works;  (ii)  the  proposed  method  for \nprocurement of goods and works financed by ADB, JBIC, and the Government of Australia; and \n(iii) the related ADB review procedures. EPC will update the procurement plan as needed for the \nduration of the Project. The procurement plan and contract packages are detailed in Appendix \n9.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n55. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of \ncandidate subprojects, (iii) construction supervision, and (iv) contract management. Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A firm will be selected through international competition \nusing  quality-and  cost-based  selection  method  to  provide  project  implementation  consulting \nservices.  About  69  international  person-months  will  be  required  for  project  implementation. \nIndividual  consultants  may  be  recruited  for  specific  assignments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures.  The  project  manager  will  be  recruited  internationally  as  an  individual  for  an  initial \nperiod  of  36  months  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  procedures.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nthe project manager and implementation consultants is in Supplementary Appendix A.   \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  response  to  EPC\u2019s  request,  ADB  is  providing  assistance  for  the  recruitment  of  the \n56. \nproject manager and implementation consultants.

Accountability \n\n9 will improve the Government\u2019s oversight of EPC.  \n\n57. \nThe  Government  will  take  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  governance  and \ntransparency  in  the  power  sector.  Strengthening  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  sector  will \nprovide  segregation  between  EPC  and  regulatory \nto  sector \nstakeholders will be strengthened through public consultations and information, particularly with \nregards to tariffs and the cost of electricity supply. The consistent application of disconnections \nwill improve EPC\u2019s ability to provide reliable electricity supply to all consumers. Benchmarking \nwill  improve  awareness  and  transparency  of  EPC\u2019s  technical  and  operational  performance. \nStrengthening  EPC\u2019s  financial  management  capabilities  and  reporting  through  the  provision  of \nRFMAs(cid:31)F\n \n58. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  EPC  and  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of EPC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n59. \nThe proceeds from the ADF loan, the ADF grant, the JBIC loan, and the grant provided \nby  the  Government  of  Australia  for  the  proposed  Project  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nwill  submit  separate  withdrawal  applications  for  the  ADF  loan,  ADF  grant,  JBIC  loan,  and  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  grant.  To  promote  efficiency  in  processing  disbursements  from  four \ndifferent  sources  under  the  Project,  a  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  at \n10 Reimbursement \n$100,000 equivalent or an amount determined to be a reasonable minimum.(cid:31)F\nand  direct  payment  procedures  will  apply  for  consulting  services,  civil  works,  and  equipment \nsupply  and  installation.  Reimbursement  procedures  will  apply  to  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The disbursement and funding arrangements is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n60. \nTo  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  approved  advance \nprocurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  defined  contracts  of  core  subprojects  as \noutlined in the procurement plan and for procurement of consulting services. Up to 20% of loan \nproceeds  are  eligible  for  retroactive  financing.  Retroactive  financing  is  applicable  to  eligible \nexpenditures, which must have been incurred before loan effectiveness, but generally no earlier \n\n                                                 \n9   The RFMAs will be provided through the TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n10 The minimum value per withdrawal for consulting services is set at $30,000 equivalent or an amount determined to \n\nbe a reasonable minimum. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n   \n\nthan 12 months before signing of the financing and project agreements. The Government and \nEPC have been advised that approval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB, JBIC, and the Government of Australia to financing the Project.  \n  \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n61. \nEPC will continue to engage independent auditors acceptable to ADB to audit its annual \nfinancial  statements  and  annual  project  accounts.  The  scope  of  work  for  the  auditors  will  be \nextended  to  include  audit  of  EPC\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  loan  covenants.  Audit \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  together  with  the  respective  financial  reports  and  the \nmemorandum  of  issues  identified  during  the  audit  process.  Annual  financial  reports  will  be \nprepared  using  international  financial  reporting  standards,  and  audits  will  be  conducted  using \ninternational standards on auditing. EPC will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within \n6 months of the end of the financial year, EPC will submit annual audited project accounts and \nannual  audited  financial  statements  of  EPC.  The  annual  financial  statements,  which  will  be \nconsolidated for all of EPC\u2019s operations, will record equity contributions by the Government of \n11 By  28  February  each  year  (commencing  28  February  2008),  EPC  will  also  prepare \nSamoa.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand  provide  ADB  5-year  financial  projections  in  a  form  agreed  with  ADB.  The  financial \nprojections will reflect updates in EPC\u2019s investment plan. \n \nEPC  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  individual  subprojects  to  ADB.  These \n62. \nreports will include a description of (i) the physical progress of the subproject; (ii) any difficulties \nencountered  and  or  anticipated  along  with  corrective  actions;  (iii) the  implementation  progress \non  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF),  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework (EARF), and subproject IEE\u2019s and EMMPs as applicable; (iv) the reasons for \nany  delays  in  project  implementation  and  recommendations  for  corrective  actions;  and  (v)  the \nsummary  of  financial  accounts  comprising  project  expenditures  during  the  previous  quarter, \nyear to date, and total to date. The quarterly progress reports will also include key performance \nand  benchmark  indicators  as  identified  in  the  approved  subproject  feasibility  studies.  As \nneeded,  the  progress  reports  will  include  updates  of  the  procurement  plan.  EPC  will  submit \nsubproject  completion  reports  within  3  months  of  subproject  completion.  The  subproject \ncompletion  report  will  (i)  provide  an  assessment  of  the  execution  and  operation  of  the \nsubproject, (ii) provide the status of compliance with loan covenants, and (iii) include results on \nsubproject outcomes and performance.  \n \n63.  MOF will provide annual reports to ADB on the interest payment from the relent grant to \nEPC  directed  to  the  CEF  and  CDM  subfund.  MOF  will  report  to  ADB  when  EPC  has  met \nconditions for the grant incentive scheme and advise as to the amount of the loan principal to be \nconverted into grants to EPC. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n64. \nEPC  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to  facilitate  the \nreporting  requirements.  The  PPMS  will  assess  progress  and  implementation  of  the  Project, \nincluding (i) resettlement activities, (ii) compliance with the EARF and subproject EMMPs, and \n(iii)  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  covenants.  The  PPMS  will  also  monitor  the  operational \nefficiency  and  financial position  and  projections  of  EPC  to  enable  benchmarking  against  other \nutilities.   \n\n                                                 \n11  Recorded equity contributions will include annual disbursed amounts of the $8 million grant from the Government \n\nof Australia.   \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n65. \nADB  will  undertake  an  inception  mission  1  month  after  loan  effectiveness  or  1  month \nafter fielding of project implementation consultants, whichever is later. Review missions will be \nundertaken at 6-monthly intervals (starting 6 months after the inception mission) for the initial 3 \nyears  of  the  Project.  The  review  missions  will  include  an  evaluation  of  (i)  project  scope  and \ncosts;  (ii)  implementation  arrangements;  (iii)  progress  in  implementing  the  LARF,  EARF,  and \nsubproject  IEEs  and  EMMPs  as  applicable;  and  (iv)  achievement  of  scheduled  targets  and \nidentification of project risks. The review missions will also undertake ongoing policy dialogue on \n(i)  EPC\u2019s  operational  efficiency  and  financial  performance,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  progress  on \npower sector reforms, and (iii) compliance with loan covenants. ADB will field a midterm review \n4 years after loan effectiveness.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n\nThe  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy  Policy  forms  part  of  the \n66. \nGovernment\u2019s  power  sector  development  plan  to  improve  access  to  sustainable  and  reliable \nelectricity services to all consumers in Samoa. The TA cluster will (i) promote the development \nof clean energy resources in Samoa through the establishment of a CEF; (ii) enable Samoa to \nparticipate  in,  and  benefit  from,  carbon-market  trading  through  the  establishment  of,  and \ncapacity building for, the DNA; (iii) develop effective regulation of the power sector and promote \ndemand-side  management  and  energy  conservation  through  support  to  regulatory  and  policy \nreform  in  the  power  sector;  and  (iv)  help  improve  EPC\u2019s  financial  performance  through  the \nprovision of RFMAs. The TA cluster is described in Appendix 11 and detailed in Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n67. \nThe Power Sector Expansion Project will help provide sustainable and reliable electricity \nservices  to  all  consumers  in  Samoa.  The  unreliable  and  poor  quality  electricity  supply  is \naffecting  all  consumers  and  is  becoming  an  increasing  constraint  to  the  expansion  of  the \ntourism  industry  and  economic  growth.  Once  the  benefits  of  the  investment  plan  have  been \nrealized,  improvements  in  power  supply  cost  effectiveness  will  reduce  the  need  for  tariff \nincreases.  \n \nEPC\u2019s  investment  plan  for  2008\u20132015  comprises  a  series  of  individual  subproject \n68. \ninvestments  in  generation  and  transmission  which  will  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of \nelectricity  supply  and  meet  forecast  demand  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  The  investment  plan  is \naccompanied by institutional and power sector reform measures to ensure that project benefits \nwill reach all electricity consumers in Samoa.  \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\nAs subprojects included under the investment plan are not stand-alone investments that \n69. \nyield benefits in isolation from other investments in the power sector, the economic and financial \nanalyses were undertaken using a time-slice approach for EPC\u2019s two power systems on Upolu \nand  Savai\u2019i.  The  analyses  are  conducted  for  23  years,  including  the  investment  period  of  8 \nyears. Oil prices were assumed to be constant at $60 per barrel (bbl) throughout the period of \nanalysis.  Estimated  annual  CDM  credits  of  $45,000  for  the  Savai\u2019i  hydropower  project  were \nincluded in the analyses. The economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n70. \nLeast-cost  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  underground  cabling  program  on  Upolu \nand  for  the  hydropower  project  on  Savai\u2019i.  Under  conservative  assumptions  on  the  cost  of \ncyclone damage to the transmission lines, it would take about two cyclones for the underground \ncabling  program  to  become  least-cost.  During  the  first  year  of  full  operation,  the  hydropower \nproject  on  Savai\u2019i  would  replace  96%  of  generation  by  the  existing  diesel  power  station  at \nSalelologa. With  demand  growth,  this  percentage  will  drop  to  75%  by  2020.  The  results  show \nthat  the  hydropower  project  is  least-cost  if  the  average  oil  price  over  the  period  of  analysis \nexceeds $53.50 per bbl.    \n \n71. \nIn  the  absence  of  an  investment  plan  on  Upolu,  the  economic  analysis  assumes  that \nEPC  would  serve  demand  from  its  existing  generation  capacity.  Unserved  demand  initially \nrepresents  deficits  in  peak  capacity.  The  transmission  system  will  increasingly  become  a \nbottleneck  for  power  supply  to  consumers  and  system  losses  will  increase.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for the investments on Upolu is estimated at 13.6%. Benefits which \nare difficult to quantify, such as those associated with the noise and emission control program at \nthe  Tanugamanono  power  station  and  the  protection  of  transmission  lines  against  climate \nchange,  have  not  been  included  in  the  analysis.  The  result  is  most  sensitive  to  the  estimated \ncapital costs. Capital cost increases of more than 14% would make the EIRR fall below 12%.  \n \nIn  the  absence  of investments  on  Savai\u2019i,  it  is  assumed  that  EPC  would  meet  demand \n72. \nwith its existing diesel power station. No improvements in the power factor or system upgrades \nwould take place. The without-investment scenario is associated with increased system losses \nand  higher  operations  and  maintenance  costs.  Under  the  base-case  fuel  price  assumption  of \n$60  per  bbl,  the  economic  analysis  yields  an  EIRR  of  10.7%.  As  the  hydropower  project  is  a \nmajor  component  of  the  investments  on  Savai\u2019i,  the  economic  results  are  most  sensitive  to \noperations and maintenance costs, and in particular to assumptions on international fuel prices. \nAn international fuel price of $67 per bbl will increase the EIRR to 12%.  \n \n73. \nThe financial analyses assume that all project capital and operations and maintenance \ncosts  are  borne  by  EPC.  The  financial  benefits  comprise  projected  sales  based  on  tariff \nprojections,  demand  forecasts,  and  estimated  carbon  credits  of  $45,000  per  year.  The \nincremental  financial  costs  comprise  capital,  operations  and  maintenance,  and  system  losses. \nFinancial benefits and costs were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), \ncalculated at 4.5. The financial net present values discounted at the WACC for the investment \nplan are ST44.1 million ($17.3 million) for the investments on Upolu and ST27.9 million ($10.9 \nmillion)  for  Savai\u2019i.  The  financial  rates  of  returns  are  7.0%  for  the  investments  on  Upolu  and \n12.1% for Savai\u2019i. The financial result for Upolu is most sensitive to an increase in capital costs, \nfollowed  by  a  reduction  in  sales.  The  investment  plan  would  remain  financially  viable  if \ninvestment cost increases do not exceed 31%. The financial result for Savai\u2019i is most sensitive \nto changes in fuel prices, but the international oil price would need to drop to below $27 per bbl \nto undermine financial viability.  \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n74. \nTo  ensure  that  social,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environment  impacts  are \nmitigated  under  the  Project,  EPC  will  establish  an  environment  and  social  unit  (ESU)  to  plan, \nimplement,  and  coordinate  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  activities  prior  to \nloan  effectiveness.  The  ESU  will  initially  be  an  integral  part  of  the  PMU  but  will  eventually \nbecome a permanent unit within EPC. The ESU will be responsible for establishing a register to \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nrecord  and  monitor  temporary  and  permanent  land  acquisition  and  record  consultations  and \ngrievances relating to land acquisition and resettlement.   \n \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nfor  candidate  subprojects  under  EPC\u2019s \n\n75. \nA LARF (Supplementary Appendix C) has been prepared in accordance with the Taking \nof  Lands  Act  (1964)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  Handbook  on \nResettlement (1998), Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006), Handbook on \nPoverty  and  Social  Analysis  (2001),  and  Handbook  for  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in \n12 The LARF will guide the preparation and procedures for land acquisition and \nProjects (1994).(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nresettlement  plans  (LARPs) \ninvestment  plan. \nSubprojects  classified  category  A  will  require  a  LARP,  category  B  subprojects  will  require  a \nshort  LARP,  and  category  C  subprojects  will  not  require  any  LARP.  Candidate  subproject \nLARPs will be prepared in full consultation with affected people and disclosed to them in draft \nform  and  included  in  the  feasibility  studies  for  candidate  subprojects.  Compensation  and \nentitlements  will  be  consistent  with  those  in  the  entitlement  matrix  outlined  in  the  LARF.  All \naffected  people  will  be  provided  with  compensation  if  (i)  land  is  permanently  or  temporarily \nacquired, (ii) their crops and trees are damaged or destroyed, or (iii) access to their traditional \nlands is limited or blocked as a result of the subproject. Lack of legal documents pertaining to \ntheir customary rights of occupancy, or lack of titles, will not affect affected people\u2019s eligibility for \ncompensation.  \n \n76. \nThe  two  core  subprojects  (the  Hospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013  stage  1,  and  the \nsupply  and  installation  of  prepayment  meters)  will  not  have  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts, are classified category C, and do not require LARPs. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Gender \n\nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy was developed based on the findings \n77. \nof an initial poverty reduction and social assessment and social surveys. During development of \nEPC's  investment  plan,  consultations  with  representatives  of  communities,  government \nministries, and other stakeholders were undertaken. Focus-group consultations were held with \nwomen. No specific impacts to women are envisaged. If land acquisition is required, women will \nbe  incorporated  into  the  consultation  and  decision-making  process.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironment \n\n78. \nAn  EARF  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental requirements as set out in the Planning and Urban Management \nAct  (2004),  the  Draft  Planning  and  Urban  Management  (Environmental  Impact  Assessment) \nRegulations  (2007),  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \n13  The  EARF  will  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  procedures  of \nGuidelines  (2003).(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nenvironmental assessments of candidate subprojects under EPC\u2019s investment plan. Subprojects \nwith  environmental  category  A  are  not  envisaged  and  will  not  be  eligible  for  ADB  financing \nunder the Project. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB.  1994.

An  EMMP  will  be  required  for  subprojects  classified  as  environmental  category  B  or  B-\nsensitive.  Subproject  feasibility  reports  will  identify  adequate  funding  for  EMMPs.  Subproject \nEMMPs will be reflected in the bid documents, incorporated into project design, and included in \ncivil works contracts for subprojects. The PMU and contractors will be guided by the EMMPs in \nmanaging,  monitoring,  and  reporting  environmental  impacts  and  compliance.  Civil  works  may \nonly commence once the IEE report of subprojects are approved by ADB and the development \nconcept approval of the PEAR is issued by PUMA.   \n \n80. \nThe Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 1 is classified environmental category B, \nand  the  supply  and  installation  of  prepayment  meters  project  is  classified  category  C.  An  IEE \nhas  been  prepared  for  the  Hospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013  stage  1  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). The summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix F. \nAn IEE is not required for the prepayment metering project.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n81. \nDebt  Sustainability.  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan  and  financing  arrangements  have  been \nprepared  considering  Samoa\u2019s  debt  sustainability.  To  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the \nlarge financing requirements in the power sector, ADB will provide an ADF IX grant of $15.39 \nmillion. The ADB and JBIC concessional loans are projected to increase Samoa\u2019s external debt \nburden from 37% of GDP in 2007 to about 39% in 2011. \n \n82. \nPolitical  Commitment  to  Power  Sector  Reform  and  Good  Governance.  Power \nsector  reform,  including  cabinet  and  parliamentary  approval  of  an  electricity  act  to  govern  all \nstakeholders  and  the  establishment  of  a  regulatory  agency,  is  critical  to  improving  the \nperformance  of  the  power  sector  and  ensuring  that  investments  translate  into  benefits  for \nelectricity  consumers.  The  TA  cluster  for  Implementing  the  Samoa  National  Energy  Policy  will \nassist the Government (i) in the consultation process, (ii) to draft and amend legislation, and (iii) \nestablish  the  regulatory  agency.  Assurances  under  the  Project  reflect  the  key  milestones  for \nregulatory reform. \n \nEPC\u2019s  Affordability.  EPC\u2019s  affordability  of  the  investment  plan  and  debt  repayment \n83. \ncapacity  has  been  carefully  considered  in  the  selection  and  timing  of  subprojects.  To  ensure \nthat timely adjustments to tariffs can be made in response to increases in EPC costs, a formal \nmechanism for determining tariffs within the context of an overall regulatory framework needs to \nbe established. Until a tariff mechanism can be established, the Government has introduced a \n14 Ongoing policy dialogue \nfuel surcharge which is subject to review by cabinet every 6 months.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand  annual  updates  of  EPC\u2019s  financial  projections  will  help  assess  tariff  requirements.  To \naddress  EPC\u2019s  poor  collection  performance,  the  Government  will  clear  all  arrears  by \ngovernment  ministries  and  state-owned  entities  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  and  prepayment \nmetering  will  be  installed  for  EPC  consumers.  The  assurances  under  the  Project  include  that \n75%  of  all  consumers  are  on  prepayment  meters  by  the  end  of  2012.  In  the  case  of  certain \nbasic  social  services  where  suspending  electricity  services  may  not  be  possible,  budgetary \nallocations for electricity consumption will be paid directly to EPC.  \n \n84. \nCounterpart Financing. EPC\u2019s ability to provide counterpart financing is expected to be \nlimited before the major financial benefits of the investment plan are realized. It is estimated that \nEPC will be able to provide $12 million of the total counterpart financing requirement over the \n\n                                                 \n14  More frequent reviews are being considered by cabinet.   \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n2008\u20132015  investment  period,  leaving  a  residual  amount  of  $8  million.  The  Government  of \nAustralia  will  finance  the  portion  beyond  the  capacity  of  EPC,  and  this will  be  reflected  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s equity in EPC.  \n \nEPC\u2019s  Implementation  Capacity  and  Cost  Overruns.  To  manage  the  risk  of  delays, \n85. \nconsultations with the attorney general have been held to ensure that Government requirements \nfor  loan  effectiveness  are  addressed  in  a  timely  manner  and  draft  bid  documents  have  been \nprepared  to  help  ensure  timely  implementation  of  core  subprojects.  Approval  of  advance \nprocurement  action  will  help  ensure  that  construction  activities  can  commence  in  accordance \nwith \nthe  project  manager  and \nimplementation  consultants  will  help  mitigate  EPC\u2019s  capacity  constraints  in  project preparation \nand  procurement  activities.

This  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in \nincreasing demand for electricity and transportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three \nmain sources: biomass (47%), fossil fuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used \nfor  cooking,  whereas  imported  petroleum  is  used  for  transportation  and  power  generation. \nImports  of  petroleum  products  account  for  15%  of  Samoa\u2019s  total  import  expenditure.  Power \ngeneration accounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum.  \n \n2. \nThe Energy Unit of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has the overall responsibility for policy \nand  strategic  planning  for  the  power  sector.  The  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC)  is  vested \nwith  all  operating  responsibilities  for  the  power  sector.  EPC  is  a  wholly  owned  government \ncorporation  established  in  1972.  The  utility  operates  as  a  separate  entity  and  is  defined  as  a \npublic trading body under the Public Bodies Act (2001) with the principal objective of operating \nas  a  commercial  business.  The  EPC  Act  (1980)  mandates  EPC  with  the  authority  for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout Samoa.  \n \n3. \nEPC  is  governed  by  a  board  of  directors,  the  composition  of  which  is  specified  in  the \nEPC  Act.  The  chairman  is  the  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Works,  Transport  and  Infrastructure \n(MWTI)  and  the  general  manager  is  the  deputy  chairman.  The  Government  is  represented  on \nthe board of directors by the chief executive officers of MOF, MWTI, and Ministry of Commerce, \nIndustry  and  Labour.  Nongovernment  representation  comprises  representatives  of \nlaw \npractitioners, the Chamber of Commerce, and domestic consumers. The general manager is the \nlegal  representative  of  EPC  and  is  responsible  for  the  administration  and  management  of \ncorporate business. The corporation has 482 employees and services about 29,800 consumers \nthroughout Samoa. With the rural electrification program nearing completion, about 95% of the \npopulation  has  access  to  electricity.  The  average  household  consumption  is  76  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) per month.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Power Systems \n\n4. \nEPC\u2019s  power  system  comprises  a  grid  on  each  of  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i  islands,  which \ntogether account for nearly all energy sales, and small stand-alone solar and diesel generation \nschemes on two isolated islands. The total installed capacity of EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), \nincluding 24.7 MW of diesel generation.  \n \nThe generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, comes from \n5. \na mix of diesel and hydropower stations. Residential consumers accounted for 25% of sales in \n2006.  The  main  power  station  on  Upolu  is  located  at  Tanugamanono  and  has  five  diesel \ngeneration units with a combined available generation capacity of 17.9 MW. One of the units is \nkept on standby and is scheduled for retirement in 2009. The load factor is about 66% and the \naverage fuel efficiency is 4 kWh per liter (l). Of the 12.5 MW of hydropower generation capacity, \n6.7  MW  is  firm,  and  4.0  MW  of  this  comes  from  the  Afulilo  storage  hydropower  scheme  on \nUpolu. The remaining hydropower capacity comes from four run-of-the-river schemes on Upolu, \none  of  which  is  scheduled  for  retirement  in  2009  unless  refurbished.  The  run-of-the-river \nhydropower  schemes  suffer  large  reductions  in  output  during  the  dry  season,  resulting  in  a \nsignificant reduction in available energy.  \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nPeak  electricity  demands  on  Upolu  reached  17.6  MW  in  2006.  With  peak  demand \ngrowing by 7.3% in the short term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW is expected in \n2008.  By  2010,  this  shortfall  will  have  increased  to  4.1  MW  if  no  new  generation  plants  are \ncommissioned.  EPC  plans  to  utilize  the  existing  capacity  from  self-generation  by  consumers \n(estimated to be at least 8 MW) to reduce peak requirements in the short term. By 2011, EPC \nwill  need  to  invest  in  new  generation  capacity.  By  2015,  the  deficit  will  increase  to  9  MW, \nrepresenting 33% of peak demand. \n \n7. \nThe  power  system  on  Upolu  faces  immediate  challenges  in  order  to  (i)  improve \nutilization of existing generation assets, (ii) reduce losses and meet demand, and (iii) improve \nreliability  of  services  to  consumers.  The  total  energy  produced  in  2006  was  101.0  gigawatt-\nhours (GWh). Energy is distributed from the power stations via 22 kilovolt (kV) and 6.6 kV radial \ntransmission lines. Along these transmission lines, transformers step the voltage down to supply \nlocal  demand.  Power  system  losses  on  Upolu  are  estimated  at  19.2%  of  energy  produced, \ninclusive of nontechnical losses.  \n \n8. \nInvestment  needs  in  the  power  system  on  Upolu  are  driven  by  the  need  to  (i)  remove \ntransmission bottlenecks to reduce losses, and (ii) improve reliability and capacity to meet peak \ndemand.  If  investments  in  the  transmission  network  are  undertaken  to  reduce  system  losses, \nthe  existing  generation  capacity  can  meet  energy  requirements  until  2018  when  a  6.2  GWh \nshortfall  is  expected.  This  shortfall  will  increase  to  20.1  GWh  by  2020  unless  additional \ngeneration capacity is installed.  \n \nSavai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station located at Salalologa. The power station \n9. \nhas  six  secondhand  generation  units  with  a  combined  available  capacity  of  5.2  MW.  The \nestimated  load  factor  is  41%  and  the  total  energy  produced  in  2006  was  11.1  GWh.  Fuel \nefficiency is estimated at 3.3 kWh per l.  \n \n10. \nSavai\u2019i accounts for about 10% of energy sales in Samoa and the majority of consumers \nare residential consumers. Peak electricity demand reached 3.0 MW in 2006 and is predicted to \ngrow at 4.3% annually in the short term. Beyond 2009, the peak demand growth is expected to \nslow to around 3.0%. The existing diesel power station is estimated to meet capacity and annual \nenergy  requirements  (assuming  appropriate  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  existing \ngeneration  units)  but  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  (i)  improve  the  control  system  at  the \npowerhouse,  (ii)  reduce  technical  and  nontechnical  power  system  losses,  (iii)  improve  fuel \ncontrol  and  conduct  regular  fuel  audits,  and  (iv)  eventually  reduce  fuel  consumption  through \nrenewable energy resources. Power is distributed via 22 kV transmission lines with step-down \ntransformers and a low voltage network to supply local demand. The total power system losses \nare estimated at 21.4%, including nontechnical losses.   \n \nC. \n\nSector Policy \n\n11. \nThe  energy  sector  in  Samoa  comprises  four  subsectors  including  petroleum,  power, \ntransport, and renewable energy. The overarching goal for the energy sector is to enhance the \nquality of life for all Samoans through access to reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound \nenergy  services  and  supply.  Developing  indigenous  and  renewable  energy  resources  and \nenergy  conservation  measures  to  reduce  the  economy\u2019s  risk  exposure  to  foreign  exchange \nfluctuations and fuel price increases is a high development priority for Samoa and is articulated \nin  the  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa.  Consistent  with  this  goal,  the  Samoa  National \nEnergy Policy 2007 emphasizes the development of the country\u2019s renewable energy resources \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nand  promotion  of  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  for  end  users  as  vital  to  achieving  a \nsustainable energy sector.  \n \n12. \nFor  the  power  sector,  the  National  Energy  Policy  outlines  the  objective  as  providing \nefficient  and  reliable  electricity  services  to  all  consumers  at  affordable  prices.  Consistent  with \nthis objective, EPC\u2019s corporate plan identifies the provision of reliable and affordable electricity \nservices as the vision for the corporation.  \n \nThe  small  size  of  the  Samoan  economy  makes  the  country  vulnerable  to  impacts  of \n13. \nclimate  change  and  global  warming.  Samoa  has  little  ability  to  directly  impact  climate  change \nand global warming. The Government\u2019s National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) 2005 is \na national implementation strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change over the long \nterm.  The  NAPA  emphasizes  the  importance  of  measures  to  adapt  to  the  changing  global \nenvironment,  including  the  prioritization  of  protection  of  key  infrastructure  assets.  EPC  is \nresponsible for undertaking protective measures for the power sector.   \n \nD. \n\nSector Priorities  \n\n14. \nThe Government\u2019s program for the power sector focuses on three immediate priorities: \n(i) EPC\u2019s investment plan to improve reliability of power supply and meet growing demand, (ii) \nimproved financial performance of EPC, and (iii) the establishment of effective regulation for the \npower  sector  to  improve  arrangements  for  tariff  setting  and  technical  regulation,  and  promote \ncost-effective  private  sector  participation.  An  enabling  environment  that  promotes  renewable \nenergy resources is a key longer-term priority.  \n \n15.  While the development of indigenous and renewable energy sources, and improvements \nin efficiency of EPC\u2019s operations, are key strategies for realizing the Government\u2019s priorities and \nEPC\u2019s corporate plan, socially acceptable, technically viable, and affordable renewable energy \nresources  are  limited  in  Samoa.  Development  of  potential  hydropower  schemes  and  other \nrenewable resources will help to replace fuel-generated power and reduce EPC\u2019s exposure to \nforeign  exchange  fluctuations  and  fuel  price increases.  However,  these  renewable  options  will \nnot help address the need to meet peak demand. The power sector is currently characterized by \nexcess  energy  and  capacity  shortages,  particularly  during  the  dry  season.  In  the  short  term, \ncapacity constraints on Upolu could be met by utilizing existing self-generation on an as-needs \nbasis. EPC has emphasized measures to reduce peak requirements. An immediate priority is to \ninstall  prepayment  meters  to  all  consumers  to  lay  the  foundation  for  effective  demand-side \nmanagement. EPC is also considering bulk-purchase agreements with major consumers which \nwill provide incentives for off-peak consumption.  \n \n16. \nThe priority for EPC is to upgrade the transmission capacity to (i) improve utilization of \nexisting  generation  plants,  (ii)  reduce  system  losses,  (iii)  improve  reliability  and  security  of \nsupply  to  main  industrial  and  commercial  consumers,  and  (iv)  address  overloading  on  the \nexisting underground transmission line to the hospital. Consistent with the priorities outlined in \nthe  NAPA  (2005),  EPC  aims  to  reduce  the  exposure  to  cyclones  of  its  transmission  network \nthrough  the  underground  cabling  of  selected  transmission  lines.  The  underground  cabling \nprogram, which is included in EPC\u2019s investment plan 2008\u20132015, comprises five subprojects: (i) \nHospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  \u2013  stage  1,  (ii)  Upolu  diesel  power  station  to  Fuluasou \nSubstation 22 kV underground cable project, (iii) Hospital Feeder upgrading project \u2013 stage 2, \n(iv) Fuluasou Substation to Apia Wharf area 22 kV underground cable project, and (v) Fuluasou \nSubstation to Laulumauga via Vaigaga 22 kV underground cable project. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nOn  Savai\u2019i,  the  key  immediate  priorities  are  to  improve  the  power  factor,  improve \n17. \nvoltages,  and  reduce  system  losses.  EPC  has  also  commenced  conducting  audits  to  improve \nfuel control. The medium-term priority is to develop the island\u2019s hydropower potential to reduce \nfuel  consumption.  However,  a  key  constraint  to  hydropower  development  in  Samoa  is  the \npolitical  nature  of  the  consultation  processes  and  the  disagreements  between  affected \ncommunities.  If  the  hydropower  potential  cannot  be  realized,  Savai\u2019i  will  continue  to  rely  on \ndiesel for power generation. \n \nUnpredictable  long-term  financing  for  needed  investments  is  a  key  factor  constraining \n18. \nEPC\u2019s  efforts  to  move  away  from  reactive  management  to  more  proactive  planning, \nmaintenance,  and  customer  relations.  EPC  is  increasingly  placing  emphasis  on  least-cost \nplanning  of  investments,  but  both  technical  and  financial  capacity  for  long-term  investment \nplanning are likely to remain constrained in the short term.  \n \n19. \nOver  the  past  6  years,  EPC  has  struggled  to  improve  its  financial  performance  to \nsatisfactory  levels.  This  is  largely  due  to  poor  collections  performance  in  combination  with \ninadequate and delayed tariff adjustments in response to fuel price increases. The effect of the \ntariff  increases  has  also  been  limited  by  EPC\u2019s  inability  to  significantly  improve  its  collections \nperformance.  Government  entities  account  for  a  disproportionate  share  of  EPC\u2019s  arrears  from \nelectricity  sales.  While  electricity  sales  to  government  entities  account  for  11%  of  total  sales, \nthey account for 59% of existing total arrears.  \n \n20. \nEPC  has  taken  measures  to  improve  its  collections.  It  has  begun  to  introduce \nprepayment  metering  and  has  so  far  installed  1,200  meters,  primarily  for  domestic  customers \nand  small  businesses.  The  investment  plan  will  extend  prepayment  metering  to  all  EPC \ncustomers,  including  three-phase  meters  for  government  ministries  and  entities,  and  private \nsector  consumers.  In  the  case  of  certain  social  services,  such  as  hospitals  and  water  supply \nwhere  suspending  electricity  service  may  not  be  possible,  it  is  proposed  that  government \nbudgetary support to these entities will incorporate a specific allocation for electricity. In cases \nwhere  these  allocations  are  not  being  used  to  pay  EPC,  the  Government  would  withhold  the \nallocation and make payment directly to EPC.  \n \nTo  ensure  that  timely  adjustments  to  tariffs  can  be  made  in  response  to  increases  in \n21. \nEPC costs, there is a need to establish a more formal mechanism for determining tariffs within \nthe  context  of  an  overall  regulatory  framework  for  the  electricity  sector.  An  automatic  tariff \nadjustment  mechanism  was  approved  by  the  Government  in  2001,  but  has  not  been  fully \nimplemented.  While  this  mechanism  provides  for  automatic  tariff  adjustments  resulting  from \nmovements in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, it lacks incentives to promote efficiency \ngains  by  EPC.  There  is  also  an  opportunity  to  improve  the  existing  tariff  structure  and  bulk \npurchase arrangements with large consumers to provide incentives for energy conservation and \ndemand-side  management.  This  is  particularly  important  during  the  growing  daily  peak  in \ndemand when EPC relies most heavily on expensive diesel generation.  \n \n22. \nIn the absence of an electricity act, the EPC Act (1980), EPC Amendments Acts (2001), \nand  the  Public  Bodies  Act  (2001)  govern  the  power  sector.  The  State  Owned  Enterprise \nMonitoring  Division  is  mandated  with  monitoring  the  financial  performance  of  EPC.  Under  the \nprovisions  of  the  EPC  Act,  the  Licensing  Committee  is  responsible  for  issuing  licensing  for \nelectrical works, generation, and distribution of electricity.  \n \n23. \nAn automatic tariff adjustment mechanism was approved in 2001 but has not been fully \nimplemented. Instead, tariff submissions are made to cabinet, which approves electricity tariffs. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33\n\nBefore  the  15%  increase  in  May  2005,  tariffs  had  remained  constant  since  2001.  A  simplified \ntariff  structure,  which  became  effective  in  February  2007,  allows  for  a  fuel  surcharge  of  15%. \nThe  fuel  surcharge  is  subject  to  review  by  cabinet  every  6  months.  There  is  currently  no \nmandated public consultation process in the existing tariff approval process. An ongoing public \nconsultation process on the cost of electricity services and tariff setting is particularly important \nconsidering  EPC\u2019s  exposure  to  international  fuel  prices.  About  60%  of  generation  is  currently \nsupplied  by  diesel  generation.  With  growing  demand,  the  impact  of  fuel  prices  on  tariff \nrequirements will increase over time. \n \n24. \nExisting  arrangements  do  not  include  formal  technical  regulation  or  monitoring  of \ntechnical performance. The lack of specifications of technical standards inhibits monitoring and \nbenchmarking  of  EPC\u2019s  technical  performance  to  ensure  investments  and  operations  and \nmaintenance are undertaken to an appropriate standard or at least-cost. \n \n25. \nAppropriate  arrangements  for  tariff  setting,  technical  regulation,  and  private  sector \nparticipation  are  becoming  increasingly  important  for  improving  the  performance  of  the  power \nsector  in  Samoa.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  the  existing  arrangements  are  a  key \ndevelopment constraint for the power sector and is embarking on a reform process to improve \nthe  performance  of  the  sector  and  encourage  cost-effective  private  sector  participation. \nDiscussions on regulatory aspects of the power sector have been taking place through technical \n1 These discussions have focused on the \nassistance provided by the Asian Development Bank.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nneed  for  an  electricity  act  to  govern  all  stakeholders  in  the  power  sector  in  Samoa,  and  for  a \nregulatory  body  to  be  established  to  (i)  remove  existing  regulatory  functions  from  EPC,  (ii) \nprovide appropriate arrangements for tariff setting, and (iii) enable private sector participation to \nreduce  public  sector  investment  requirements  and  promote  least-cost  generation  to  meet \ngrowing  electricity  demand.

The total installed capacity \nof EPC is 37.2 megawatts (MW), including 24.7 MW of diesel generation.  \n \nA. \n\nThe Power System on Upolu \n\n2. \nThe generation on Upolu, which accounts for 90% of EPC\u2019s total generation, is a mix of \ndiesel and hydropower stations. The main power station on Upolu is located at Tanugamanono \nand has five diesel generation units with a combined available generation capacity of 17.9 MW. \nOne of the units is kept on standby and is scheduled for retirement in 2009. The load factor is \nabout 66% and the average fuel efficiency is 4 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per liter (l). Of the 12.5 MW \nof hydropower generation capacity, 6.7 MW is firm, and 4.0 MW of that comes from the Afulilo \nstorage  hydropower  scheme.  The  remaining  hydropower  capacity  comes  from  four  run-of-the-\nriver  schemes  on  Upolu,  one  of  which  is  scheduled  for  retirement  in  2009  unless  refurbished. \nThe run-of-the-river hydropower schemes suffer from large  reductions in output during the dry \nseason, resulting in a significant reduction in available energy.  \n \nInvestment needs in generation are mainly driven by growing peak electricity demands. \n3. \nPeak demand on Upolu reached 17.6 MW in 2006 (Table A3.1). With peak demand growing by \n7.3% in the short term and by 4% beyond 2009, a shortfall of 0.3 MW is expected in 2008. By \n2010,  this  shortfall  will  have  increased  to  4.1  MW  if  no  new  generation  plants  are \ncommissioned.  EPC  plans  to  utilize  the  existing  capacity  from  self-generation  by  consumers \n(estimated to be at least 8 MW) to reduce peak requirements in the short term. By 2011, EPC \nwould  need  to  invest  in  new  generation  capacity.  By  2015,  the  deficit  will  increase  to  9  MW, \nrepresenting 33% of peak demand. \n\n \nTable A3.1: Upolu Power Balance \n(MW) \n\nYear \n\nPeak \nDemand \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n\n17.0 \n17.6 \n19.7 \n20.8 \n21.7 \n22.6 \n23.5 \n\nTotal Firm \nGeneration \nCapacity \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n22.8 \n22.8 \n\nFirm Capacity \nat N-1 \nReserve \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.3 \n18.5 \n18.5 \n\nPower \nBalance at \nN-1 \n3.6 \n3.0 \n0.9 \n(0.3) \n(1.4) \n(4.1) \n(5.0) \n\nReserve Firm \nGeneration \nCapacity \n7.7 \n7.1 \n5.0 \n3.8 \n2.9 \n0.2 \n(0.7) \n\n  MW = megawatt, N-1 = total generation capacity minus the largest generator.  \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Electric Power Corporation estimates. \n \n4. \nThe total energy produced on Upolu in 2006 was 101.0 gigawatt-hours (GWh). Energy is \ndistributed  from  the  power  stations  via  22  kilovolt  (kV)  and  6.6  kV  radial  transmission  lines. \nAlong  these  transmission  lines,  transformers  step  the  voltage  down  to  supply  local  demand. \nTotal  power  system  losses  on  Upolu  are  estimated  at  19.2%  of  energy  produced.  The \ntransmission  system,  which  is  aging,  overloaded,  and  poorly  maintained,  is  increasingly \nbecoming a bottleneck to the reliable supply of electricity. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n \n5. \nInvestment needs in the transmission network are driven by the need to reduce losses \nand  increase  capacity  to  improve  reliability  and  meet  peak  demand.  If  investments  in  the \ntransmission network are undertaken to reduce system losses, the existing generation capacity \n1 This shortfall \ncan meet energy requirements until 2013 when a 1.3 GWh shortfall is expected.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nwill increase to 25.7 GWh by 2020 unless additional generation capacity is installed.  \n \n6. \nLoad-flow  analysis  was  conducted  on  individual  transmission  lines  and  the  power \nsystem  as  a  whole  for  peak  demand.  The  analysis  shows  that  voltage  drops  and  losses  are \nexcessive  on  two  of  the  three  6.6  kV  transmission  lines,  including  the  Hospital  and  Alaoa \ntransmission lines. Overloading of the existing Hospital Feeder, which carries more than 10% of \nenergy  sold  on  Upolu,  contributes  significantly  to  the  high  overall  system  losses  and  voltage \ndrops. By 2011, the Hospital Feeder is estimated to be 30% overloaded. The underutilized 22 \nkV  Vaitele  Feeder  is  identified  as  a  prime  candidate  to  provide  relief  for  the  Hospital  Feeder. \nThe  West  Coast  22  kV  transmission  line,  which  supplies  power  to  consumers  west  of  Apia, \nshows  risk  of  overloading  by  2011.  Voltage  drops  at  peak  demand  are  predicted  to  increase \nfrom 8.9% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2016 as the demand on the transmission line increases. Losses \nare  estimated  to  increase  from  4.3%  in  2006  to  7.4%  by  2016.  Similarly,  the  South  Coast \ntransmission  line  will  experience  voltage  drops  before  2016.

In  2004,  when \ncyclone Heta hit Samoa, system losses increased by 21% for the year. Consumers in the main \nindustrial and business districts were left without power for several weeks. The direct costs for \npower  sector  infrastructure  were  estimated  at  $2.8  million.  To  reduce  the  vulnerability  to \ncyclones  and  other  weather  events  of  the  transmission  network,  EPC  plans  to  place \nunderground key transmission lines that serve the major load centers in Apia.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Power System on Savai\u2019i \n\n8. \nSavai\u2019i has one operational diesel power station at Salalologa. The power station has six \nsecondhand generation units with a combined available capacity of 5.2 MW. The estimated load \nfactor is 41% and the total energy produced in 2006 was 11.1 GWh. Fuel efficiency is estimated \nat 3.3 kWh per l.  \n \nSavai\u2019i accounts for about 10% of energy sales in Samoa and the majority of consumers \n9. \nare residential consumers. Peak electricity demand reached 3.0 MW in 2006 and is predicted to \ngrow at 4.3% annually in the short term. Beyond 2009, the peak growth is expected to slow to \naround 3.0%. The power balance is shown in Table A3.4. The existing diesel power station is \nestimated to meet capacity and annual energy requirements (assuming appropriate operations \nand maintenance of the existing generation units) but there is an urgent need to (i) improve the \ncontrol system at the powerhouse, (ii) reduce technical and nontechnical power system losses, \n(iii)  improve  fuel  control,  and  (iv)  conduct  regular  fuel  audits.  To  reduce  fuel  consumption  on \nSavai\u2019i and diversify energy sources, EPC aims to develop the hydropower potential.    \n \n\nTable A3.4: Savai\u2019i Power Balance  \n\nYear \n\nPeak Demand \n(MW) \n\nTotal Sales \n(GWh) \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Electric Power Corporation. \n\n8.93  \n8.41  \n8.54  \n8.91  \n9.48  \n9.82  \n10.17  \n\n2.9 \n3.0 \n3.1 \n3.3 \n3.4 \n3.5 \n3.6 \n\nTotal Generation \nCapacity \n(MW) \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n\nReserve Firm \nGeneration Capacity \n(MW) \n2.2 \n2.2 \n2.1 \n1.9 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.6 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n37 \n\n \n10. \nPower is distributed via 22 kV transmission lines with step-down transformers and a low \nvoltage network to supply local demand.

With technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), EPC has developed \nan investment plan for generation and transmission investments for the period 2008\u20132015. The \ninvestment  plan is consistent with the Government\u2019s and EPC\u2019s immediate priorities to secure \nreliability  of  power  supply  to  the  main  economic  growth  center  and  the  hospital,  and  improve \nrevenue  collection  for  EPC  through  installation  of  prepayment  meters  for  all  consumers.  An \nimmediate  priority  is  to  install  prepayment  meters  to  all  consumers  to  improve  and  lay  the \nfoundation  for  effective  demand-side  management.  EPC  is  also  considering  bulk-purchase \nagreements  with  major  consumers  to  provide  incentives  to  switch  from  peak  to  off-peak \nconsumption. \n \n12. \nEPC\u2019s  power  systems  are  currently  characterized  by  excess  energy  and  capacity \nshortages, particularly during the dry season. EPC has prioritized increasing the capacity of the \ntransmission  network  to  improve  reliability  and  security  of  supply  to  the  main  business  and \ncommercial load center in Apia, and reduce the load on the existing underground transmission \nline  to  the  hospital.  EPC  aims  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  its  transmission  network  through \nunderground  cabling  of  selected  transmission  lines.  The  underground  cabling  program \ncomprises  the  Hospital  Feeder  upgrading  project  and  the  Vaitele  underground  cable  project. \nThese transmission lines evacuate power to the hospital and the main industrial and commercial \nareas  of  Apia.  To  support  EPC\u2019s  loss-reduction  program,  portable  equipment  for  measuring \nvoltage  and  current  are  included  for  purchase  in  2008.  This  will  help  identify  measures  for \nfurther loss reduction. \n \n13. \nOn  Savai\u2019i,  the  immediate  priorities  are  to  improve  the  power  factor,  improve  voltages, \nand reduce system losses. A mini-hydro plant that will reduce fuel consumption on the island is \nscheduled  for  commissioning  in  2014.  To  identify  future  feasible  hydropower  projects  on  both \nUpolu and Savai\u2019i, water-flow gauging measurement equipment has been included for purchase \nin 2008.

Due largely to inadequate tariff levels and poor collections performance, \nEPC has been unable to meet its debt service obligations and still fund capital investments that \nare  essential  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand.  With  90%  of  its  debt  payable  to  the \nGovernment under 12 separate loans, EPC secured an agreement to restructure this debt into a \nsingle  loan  in  2002.  Although  this  reduced  annual  debt  service  by  30%,  EPC  again  fell  into \narrears. By July 2006, it had paid only 55% of the amount due under the restructuring and was \nin arrears by just under ST9 million ($3.5 million). With continuing growth in sales and reduced \nunit  operating  costs,  EPC\u2019s  financial  performance  gradually  improved  up  to  FY2004,  before \nweakening  again  in  FY2005,  primarily  because  of  higher  fuel  prices.  Although  tariffs  were \nincreased  by  15%  in  May  2005,  this  was  not  sufficient  to  fully  offset  higher  fuel  costs.  Fuel \nprices  continued  to  increase,  and  by  August  2006  were  75%  higher  than  in  mid-2004.  In \nFebruary 2007, a fuel surcharge was introduced that implied an effective average tariff increase \nof  14%.  However,  the  impact  of  tariff  increases  has  been  limited  by  EPC\u2019s  inability  to \nsignificantly improve its poor collections performance, a disproportionate share of which is due \nto government accounts. \n \n2. \nSales  and  Profitability.  About  95%  of  EPC\u2019s  revenue  is  generated  from  the  sale  of \nelectricity. Since FY2001, electricity revenue has increased just over 50% (about four times the \ngrowth  in  sales)  due  to  the  cancellation  of  prompt  payment  discounts  and  proportionately \ngreater  nondomestic  consumption.  This  revenue  growth,  combined  with  lower  unit  operating \ncosts, enabled EPC to earn modest net profits over the FY2003\u2013FY2006 period after net losses \nthe two previous years. Net profit peaked in FY2004 at ST2.4 million ($0.9 million) on revenue \nof  ST53.7  million  ($21.1  million)  before  declining  to  just  over  ST0.3  million  ($0.1  million)  in \nFY2005 and ST1.4 million ($0.6 million) in FY2006. This decline in profitability was due primarily \nto  higher  fuel  prices  and  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  diesel  generation.  With  existing \nhydropower  facilities  operating  at  or  near  capacity,  increases  in  supply  are  being  provided \nalmost  entirely  from  diesel  generation.  In  FY2006,  diesel  generation  represented  53%  of  total \nenergy supply, up from 48% in FY2002. \n \nCost Structure. EPC\u2019s cost structure reflects its small scale of operations, distance from \n3. \nmajor markets, and particularly, its reliance on diesel generation. The overall cost of supply was \nST0.71 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.28 per kWh) sold in FY2006. Fuel is by far the single largest \nexpense item, representing 74% of generation costs and 53% of EPC\u2019s total costs. This leaves \nEPC highly exposed to changes in world oil prices.  \n \n4. \nTariffs.  Given  EPC\u2019s  vulnerability  to  volatile  world  oil  markets,  the  delay  in  adjusting \ntariffs to cover rapidly increasing fuel prices since 2004 has resulted in a significant deterioration \nin  EPC\u2019s  financial  position.  The  average  tariff  remained  unchanged  between  1998  and  2005 \nalthough  the  structure  was  revised  in  2001  to  incorporate  block  tariffs  for  domestic  customers \n(Table A4.1). The 15% increase in May 2005 was insufficient to cover the significant increases \nin EPC\u2019s costs that had accumulated since 1998. The most recent increase (14% in February \n2007) is a fuel surcharge which will be reviewed in 6 months on the basis of fuel prices at that \ntime. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A4.1: Historic Tariffs \n(ST per kWh; current prices) \n\nSeptember \n1998 \n\nNovember \n2001 \n\nMay \n2005 \n\nFebruary \n2007 a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Item \nDomestic \n  1\u201350 kWh per month \n  51\u2013200 kWh per month \n  > 200 kWh per monthb \nNondomestic \nAll Customers Flat Rate \nAveragec \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  As of February 2007, the domestic blocks are 1\u201350 kWh per month and > 51 kWh per month. \nb  Weighted average tariff based on tariffs in effect at end of fiscal year. \nc Including the fuel surcharge. \nSource: Electric Power Corporation. \n\n0.58 \n0.69 \n0.83 \n0.69 \n\u2014 \n0.68 \n\n0.50 \n0.60 \n0.72 \n0.60 \n\u2014 \n0.59 \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n\n \n\n0.67 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n0.79 \n\u2014 \n0.77 \n\n \n\n5. \nDespite  a  gradual  improvement  in  profitability  up  to  FY2004,  EPC  has  continued  to \nexperience  serious  cash  flow  difficulties,  which  has  caused  it  to  fail  to  meet  its  debt  service \nobligations and significantly curtail capital investments. With negative net cash flows in 3 of the \npast  6  years,  the  cash balance  declined  from  ST16.4  million  ($6.4  million)  at  the  beginning  of \nFY2001 to ST4.7 million ($1.9 million) by the end of FY2006. Given its weakening cash position, \n1 over \ncapital investments had to be limited to an annual average of ST12.9 million ($5.1 million)(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthis period. Although modest in relation to EPC\u2019s investment needs, capital spending placed a \nsignificant  strain  on  the  corporation  because  over  80%  was  self-financed.  This  left  insufficient \nresidual cash flow to service EPC\u2019s debt.  \n \n6. \nCollection  Performance.  EPC\u2019s  poor  collection  performance,  which  has  progressively \ndeteriorated over the past 6 years, has been a major factor adversely affecting net cash flows. \nAt  the  end  of  FY2006,  gross  receivables  were  ST14.4  million  ($5.6  million),  equivalent  to  80 \ndays  of  annual  electricity  billings,  up  from  53  days  in  FY2001.  By  the  end  of  May  2007, \nreceivables  had  increased  to  ST15  million  ($5.9  million),  despite  a  partial  settlement  of \ngovernment arrears in February 2007. Of this total, ST12.5 million ($4.9 million) is attributable to \nelectricity sales, of which ST7.4 million ($2.9 million), or 59% of the total, are in arrears. EPC\u2019s \n2 totaled ST2.5 million ($1.0 million) at the end of March \nreceivables in its nonelectricity account(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n2007.  \n \n7. \nGovernment  Arrears.  Although  EPC  has  made  some  progress  in  achieving  better \ncollections  from  its  private  sector  customers,  its  inability  to  take  action  against  delinquent \ngovernment  accounts  has  blocked  any  meaningful  improvement  in  collections.  While  sales  to \nthe  Government  account  for  11%  of  the  total,  55%  of  existing  arrears  are  due  to  the \nGovernment.  EPC\u2019s  largest  single  debtor  is  the  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA),  which  held \narrears of ST1.9 million ($0.7 million) at the end of May 2007. This amount represents 47% of \nelectricity  arrears  held  by  the  Government  and  26%  of  total  electricity  arrears.  SWA\u2019s  arrears \n\n                                                 \n1   Reported  capital  expenditures  appear  to  overestimate  actual  expenditures  because  of  accounting  deficiencies  in \n\nthe separation of total expenditures between those for capital works and operations and maintenance. \n\n2   These relate to new connection charges and other capital works (referred to as rechargeable works) as well as to \n\nold arrears from electricity sales, primarily from accounts now inactive. \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nwould have been much higher if the Government had not periodically intervened to settle these \narrears on behalf of SWA.  \n  \n8. \nCovenant  Compliance.  With  its  weak  financial  performance,  EPC  has  achieved  only \nlimited compliance with its financial covenants applied under existing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loans (Table A4.2).  \n \n\nTable A4.2: Status of Covenant Compliance \n\nIndicator \nReturn on Average Net Fixed \nAssets \n\nADB Covenant \n\nFY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006 \n\n(1.8%) \n\n(0.1%) \n\n1.1% \n\n1.6% \n\n0.4% \n\n1.2% \n\nMinimum: 4% \nFY2002\u2013FY2004, \nminimum 6% \nthereafter \n\nSelf-Financing Ratio (5 yr ave)  Minimum: 20% \n\n(18%) \n\n(10%) \n\n(2%) \n\n9% \n\n14% \n\n26% \n\nNet Income/(Loss) (ST million)  Minimum: 0 \n\n(3.74) \n\n(0.74) \n\nDebt-Service Ratio (times) \n\nMinimum: 1.3 \n\nReceivables (months of sales)  Maximum: 2 \n\n0.38  \n\n1.80  \n\n0.68  \n\n1.90  \n\n1.38  \n\n1.21  \n\n2.30 \n\n2.32  \n\n1.51  \n\n3.10  \n\n0.28  \n\n1.21  \n\n2.60  \n\n1.39  \n\n1.44  \n\n2.70  \n\nmonths \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = fiscal year.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nB. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\nFinancial projections have been prepared for EPC for the FY2007\u2013FY2017 period. The \n9. \nassumptions and analysis are detailed in Supplementary Appendix H. Assuming that oil prices \nremain at $60 per barrel (bbl) in constant prices, the financial projections indicate a need for two \ntariff  increases  of  10%  each  over  the  FY2008\u2013FY2012  period.  These  tariff  increases  will \ngenerate  the  additional  cash  flow  needed  to  cover  operating  expenses,  debt  service,  and  a \nportion of the counterpart funding for the investment plan. The first increase, which would need \nto be implemented by early 2009, would raise the average tariff from its present level of ST0.77 \nper kWh ($0.30 per kWh) to ST0.85 per kWh ($0.33 per kWh). The second increase of 10% in \nearly  2012  would  raise  the  average  tariff  to  ST0.94  per  kWh  ($0.37  per  kWh).  Once  the \nregulatory agency is established and becomes fully operational, a mechanism for regular tariff \nreviews and adjustments will be in place. Therefore, beyond 2012, smaller annual increases of \njust  over  5%  per  year  (equivalent  to  real  increases  of  about  2%  annually)  are  assumed  to  be \nimplemented. \n \n10. \nCash  Generation. EPC\u2019s financial performance is projected to be satisfactory provided \nthat required tariff increases are implemented and collection performance improves. Operating \nnet  cash  flows  are  projected  to  almost  double  from  ST14.7  million  ($5.8  million)  in  FY2006  to \nST26.2 million ($10.3 million) by FY2015. Over the initial phase of the investment plan, this cash \nneeds  to  be  allocated  largely  towards  meeting  counterpart  financing  requirements  as  well  as \ndebt  service  on  EPC\u2019s  existing  Government  loan.  As  the  investment  plan  is  progressively \nimplemented, cash is increasingly allocated to  meeting interest and principal repayment on its \nloans to the Government.  \n\n \n11. \nProfitability.  Net  profit  is  projected  to  improve  significantly  over  the  next  3  years, \nincreasing from ST1.4 million ($0.5 million) in FY2006 to ST7.6 million ($3.0 million) in FY2010, \nbecause of the tariff increase in 2009 and continued growth in sales. However, over the next 5 \nyears (2011\u20132015) of the forecast period, net profit is anticipated to be much lower, averaging \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n43 \n\n \n\nST3.6  million  ($1.4  million)  per  year.  This  is  due  to  three  main  factors:  (i)  tariff  increases  are \nlimited  to  a  maximum  of  one  every  second  year;  (ii)  as  the  investment  plan  is  implemented, \ninterest  and  depreciation  expenses  increase  significantly;  and  (iii)  there  is  a  need  for  real \nincreases  in  certain  expenditure  items,  such  as  repairs  and  maintenance,  in  order  to  recover \nfrom past underfunding.  \n \n12. \nCounterpart  Financing.  Even  with  the  projected  tariff  increases  and  improved \ncollections, EPC is not expected to have the capacity to provide the entire $20 million equivalent \ncounterpart financing  required  for  the  investment  plan.  It  is estimated  that  EPC  will be  able  to \nprovide  $12  million  of  the  total  counterpart  funding  requirement  over  the  FY2008\u2013FY2015 \ninvestment period. The Government will provide equity injections into EPC to cover the residual \namount of $8 million. About 65% of the Government contribution will be required over the 3-year \nperiod  between  FY2010  and  FY2012.  As  the  benefits  from  the  investment  plan  are  realized, \nrevenue  growth,  in  combination  with  efficiency  improvements,  will  enable  EPC  to  meet  a \nprogressively larger share of counterpart funding. Over the last 3 years of the Project, EPC will \nprovide 75% of the required counterpart funding. \n \n13. \nCovenant  Compliance.  The  financial  projections  indicate  that  EPC  can  meet  the \nagreed financial covenants provided that the required tariff increases are implemented together \nwith  improved  collection  performance.  EPC  will  need  to  carefully  assess  and  monitor  its  cash \n3 over  the \ngeneration  in  order  to  ensure  that  it  can  comply  with  the  self-financing  covenant(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ninvestment  period.  EPC\u2019s  self-financing  capacity  will  vary  from  year  to  year,  depending  on  its \ncash  generation  and  on  the  size  of  the  capital  investments  in  each  year.  Although  cash \ngeneration will generally improve over the forecast period, the self-financing ratio (SFR) will be \nweakest between FY2011 and FY2013. The SFR is projected to be 12% in FY2013, the peak \ninvestment  year,  and  19%  in  both  FY2011  and  FY2012.  As  operating  cash  flows  continue  to \nimprove and as capital expenditures decline beyond FY2015, the self-financing capacity should \nimprove to meet an SFR of at least 20%. \n\n \n14. \nImproved  cash  generation  should  enable  EPC  to  comply  with  the  debt-service  ratio \n(DSR)  covenant  in  each  year  over  the  forecast  period  provided  that  tariff  increases  are \nimplemented. Prior to the commencement of principal repayments in FY2013, the DSR should \nremain well above the covenanted minimum of 1.3. However, with the commencement of debt \nservice, the DSR is projected to drop to 1.6.  \n \n15. \nEPC\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain receivables at or below the covenanted maximum \nof 2 months worth of sales will depend upon its collections performance and the extent to which \nit  writes  off  uncollectible  arrears.  Collections  will  receive  an  immediate  boost  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s agreement to settle a significant portion of its arrears in FY2008. However, EPC \nwill also need to make a large write-off of uncollectible private sector arrears during FY2008 to \nbring receivables down to 2 months of sales. While these immediate steps will address much of \nthe  existing  arrears,  only  significantly \nimproved  collections  performance  will  maintain \nreceivables  at  acceptable  levels.  With  the  progressive  introduction  of  prepayment  metering, \nEPC is projected to be able to improve collections to levels sufficient to maintain its receivables \nat between 1.8 and 2 months over the forecast period.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The covenant for the SFR is 12% for FY2008\u2013FY2015 and 20% for 2016 onwards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n16. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in \nselected  key  variables  on  the  financial  performance  of  EPC.  The  variables  tested  were  (i)  a \nlower rate of sales growth, (ii) a higher rate of increase in fuel prices, and (iii) a slower rate of \nimprovement  in  collections  performance.  The  tariffs  required  to  achieve  satisfactory  financial \nperformance under the tested variables are given in Table A4.3. \n \n\nTable A4.3: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n(ST per kWh) \n \n\nExisting \n\nRequired Average Tariffs  \n\nScenario \n\nBase Case \nLower Sales Growthb  \nHigher Fuel Pricesc \n\nLess Improvement in \nCollection Performanced \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2009 \n\nFY2012 \n\nFY2015 \n\n0.77 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.85 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.93 \n\n0.85 \n\n0.94 \n\n0.95 \n\n1.04 \n\n0.96 \n\n1.12 \n\n1.14 \n\n1.26 \n\n1.18 \n\nTotal \nIncreasea \n(%) \n\n45 \n\n48 \n\n64 \n\n53 \n\nFY = fiscal year, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  Total increase over FY2007\u2013FY2015 period. \nb  Growth in sales assumed to be 65% of the base case. \nc  Average fuel price based on $75 per barrel. \nd  Collections remain at 95% for both electricity and rechargeable works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n17. \nThe analysis indicates that EPC\u2019s vulnerability to fuel prices has the greatest impact on \ntariffs. Under the base-case, projected fuel prices over the forecast period have been assumed \nto correspond to a world crude oil price of $60 per bbl, expressed in constant 2007 prices. For \nthe sensitivity analysis, fuel prices are assumed to correspond to $75 per bbl, also expressed in \nconstant  2007  prices.  This  higher  cost  of  fuel  would  require  that  EPC\u2019s  average  tariff  be \nincreased  by  64%  over  the  FY2007\u2013FY2015  period,  compared  to  45%  under  the  $60  per  bbl \nbase  case.  The  sensitivity  analysis  is  likely  to  underestimate  the  true  impact  on  tariff \nrequirements  as  higher  world  oil  prices  would  also  increase  the  general  price  level  of  other \ninputs required by EPC. \n \nIn all three scenarios assessed under the sensitivity analysis, the key factor driving the \n18. \nneed  for  higher  tariffs  is  the  requirement  to  self-finance  a  portion  of  EPC\u2019s  capital  investment \nplan  while  also  covering  operating  costs  and  existing  debt-service  obligations.  Without  such \ntariff increases, EPC would not be able to finance its $12 million contribution to the Project.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n\n \n1. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  active  in  the  power  sector  in  Samoa \nsince  1971  when  it  provided  the  first  technical  assistance  (TA)  project.

The  project  will  improve  the  capacity  to  meet  growing \nelectricity  demand  and  improve  cost-effectiveness  of  power  supply  by  (i)  improving  the \noperational efficiency  and  financial performance  of  EPC,  (ii)  improving  quality  and  reliability  of \nelectricity  supply  at  least  cost,  and  (iii)  establishing  an  effective  regulatory  structure  for  the \npower sector. \n \n2. \nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  identify  candidate  subprojects  meeting  the \ncriteria  set  forth  in  para.  3  below  and  will  obtain  approval  from  the  EPC  board  to  assess  the \nfeasibility of the candidate subprojects and inform the project steering committee (PSC) of the \npending  subproject  feasibility  study.  The  PMU  will  then  prepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each \ncandidate  subproject.  The  candidate  subproject  feasibility  report  will,  among  other  things, \nprovide (i) technical analysis and description; (ii) subproject rationale, scope, and components; \n(iii) cost estimates and a financing plan; (iv) implementation arrangements; (v) an environmental \nassessment; and (vi) a land acquisition and resettlement assessment. The feasibility report will \nalso contain an update of EPC\u2019s investment plan and an analysis of the candidate subproject\u2019s \nimpacts  on  EPC\u2019s  5-year  financial  projections,  key  financial  ratios,  and  compliance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) covenants. Each feasibility report will be submitted to ADB for review \nand  approval  and  will  contain  sufficient  evidence  of  the  candidate  subproject\u2019s  eligibility  under \nthe  agreed  criteria  and  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  detail  and  quality  required  to \nenable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the  candidate  subproject.  The  feasibility \nreports will include a set of relevant benchmark and performance indicators for the subproject \nwhich will be monitored through progress reports. After ADB has endorsed the feasibility study, \nthe PMU will submit the feasibility study to the EPC board and the PSC for review and approval. \nImplementation  of  a  candidate  subproject  may  only  proceed  following  the  endorsement  of  the \ncandidate  subproject  feasibility  report  by  the  PSC,  the  EPC  board,  and  ADB.  The  subproject \nselection process is shown in Figure A7. \n \n3. \nin accordance with the following criteria. \n \n\nTo be eligible for financing through the project, (structural) subprojects must be selected \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\nthe  objectives  of \n\nThe  subproject  (a)  contributes \nthe  Power  Sector \nDevelopment  Plan,  (b)  is  identified  as  a  high  priority  project  in  EPC\u2019s  annual \nbusiness plan, and (c) is included in EPC\u2019s investment plan. \nThe  subproject  is  technically  feasible  and  meets  the  Government\u2019s  technical \nstandards and requirements. \nThe subproject is justified as the most feasible subproject to achieve the stated \nobjectives and is shown to be least-cost among feasible alternatives. \nA land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) will have been prepared for the \nsubproject  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(LARF), if required, and EPC will have submitted written confirmation to ADB that \nthe  landowner  and  or  lessee  (in  the  case  of  freehold  and  state-owned  land)  or \n1 (in  the  case  customary  land),  acting  on  behalf  of  affected  persons \nthe  matai(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nunder the subproject, is agreeable to the land acquisition and resettlement plan \nterms and conditions. \n\n                                                 \n1   The title matai is an elected chief representing an extended family unit. The title may be bestowed on anyone in the \n\ncustomary Samoan society. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n51 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nAn environmental screening will have been conducted for the subproject and an \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  preliminary  environmental  assessment \nreport (PEAR), and environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) will \nhave  been  prepared  for  the  subproject,  in  each  case,  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions of the environmental assessment and review framework.  \nADB  determines  that  EPC  has  the  necessary  staffing,  implementation,  and \nfinancial management capacity to implement the subproject or, in the alternative, \nEPC  can  provide  specific  assurances  that  assessed  shortcomings  can  be \nrectified, such as by adding qualified staff or providing timely in-service training. \nThe  subproject's  implementation  timeframe  is  reasonable,  and  surveys  and \ndesign can be prepared and reviewed, and safeguard processes and procedures \nfollowed and implemented, within the project period. \n\n(viii)  The  financing  plan  clearly  identifies  confirmed  sources  of  financing,  including \ncounterpart financing, and includes the provision of budgetary resources to meet \n(a)  counterpart  funding  requirements  for  capital  expenditures  during  the \nconstruction  phase,  (b)  resettlement  costs,  as  applicable,  (c)  environmental \nmanagement costs, (d) loan repayment requirements, and (e) routine operations \nand maintenance costs.   \nThe  subproject  will  not

The objective is to improve access \nto  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  services  for  all  consumers  in  Samoa  by  improving  the \nquality,  reliability,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  power  supply.  The  TA  cluster  will  (i)  promote  the \ndevelopment of clean energy resources in Samoa through the establishment of a clean energy \nfund (CEF); (ii) enable Samoa to participate in, and benefit from, carbon-market trading through \nthe  establishment  of,  and  capacity  building  for,  a  designated  national  authority  (DNA);  (iii) \ndevelop  effective  regulation  of  the  power  sector  and  promote  demand-side  management  and \nenergy conservation through support for regulatory and policy reform in the power sector; and \n(iv) help improve EPC\u2019s financial performance through resident financial management advisors \n(RFMAs). The technical assistance report is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n3. \nThe  TA  cluster  supports  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  for  the  power  sector  through  four \ncomponents:  Component  1  comprises  the  establishment  of  a  CEF  and  a  clean  development \nmechanism  (CDM)  subfund;  Component  2  will  establish  and  build  capacity  of  a  DNA; \nComponent  3  will  support  the  Government  in  undertaking  regulatory  and  policy  reform  in  the \npower  sector;  Component  4  will  provide  RFMAs  to  EPC.  Capacity  building  and  stakeholder \nconsultations are integral parts of all components. \n \n4. \nComponent 1: Establishment of the CEF. The CEF will help improve the coordination \nof financing sources for clean energy resources in Samoa and is envisaged as a revolving fund. \nComponent 1 will (i) help establish the governance and operational structure, human resources, \nand  working  and  reporting  guidelines  of  the  CEF  and  a  CDM  subfund,  (ii)  identify  a  project \npipeline, and (iii) increase public awareness on clean and renewable energy. The CDM subfund \nwill  help  finance  initial  transactions  costs  associated  with  getting  eligible  projects  additional \nfinancing under the CDM. This may include preparation of project design documents, validation \nof  project  design  documents  by  an  operational  entity  or  independent  third  party  validator,  and \nregistration of projects with the CDM executive board.   \n \nComponent  2:  Establishment  of,  and  Capacity  Building  for,  the  DNA.  The \n5. \nestablishment of a DNA will enable Samoa to benefit from the CDM. Component 2, which will be \nimplemented jointly with Component 1 to ensure that the two components are well coordinated, \nwill,  through  a  consultative  process;  (i)  establish  the  operational  structure  and  resource \nrequirements; (ii) develop working guidelines and procedures for the DNA, (iii) provide capacity \nbuilding and hands-on training for stakeholders and DNA staff in procedural requirements using \na  pilot  project  (identified  in  the  project  pipeline  under  Component  1);  and  (iv)  raise  public \nawareness on the role, functions, and requirements of the DNA.    \n\n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 July 2007. \n2   ADB. 2007.

Component  3 \ncomprises  support  for  the  development  of  (i)  a  demand-side  management  and  energy \nconservation strategy, (ii) a legal framework to govern all stakeholders in the power sector, and \n(iii)  the  establishment  of  a  regulator.  The  demand-side  management  and  energy  conservation \nstrategy  will  focus  on  the  policy  environment  and  tax  incentives  to  promote  energy  efficiency. \nSupport  to  regulatory  reform  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases  allowing  for  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  political  decision  processes.  The  first  phase  will  focus  on  the  scoping  of  a \nregulatory framework that will allow the Government to make a decision in principle on the roles, \nfunctions, and structure of a regulatory agency, including the independence, authority for tariff \nregulation, and accountability of the regulator and the scope for multisector regulation. The first \nphase  will  guide  the  direction  of  subsequent  phases.  Phase  2  will  develop  the  regulatory \nframework, including the drafting of new legislation and amendments to existing legislation for \nconsideration by cabinet and parliament and the preparation of a detailed budget and resource \nassessment for approval in the forthcoming budget year. Once the Government has approved \nthe  legislation  and  the  budget  of  the  regulator,  recruitment  of  a  suitable  regulator  and  initial \ncapacity building and the development of working guidelines of the regulator can commence.  \n \n7. \nComponent  4:  RFMAs  to  the  Electric  Power  Corporation.  Two  RFMAs  (one \naccountant and one analyst) will be engaged to assist EPC in (i) improving internal budgeting \nand expenditure controls; (ii) consolidating accounts and financial reporting and forecasts to the \nEPC board, the Government, and ADB; and (iii) developing peak and off-peak tariffs and bulk \npurchase agreements with EPC\u2019s major customers. Capacity building and training is an integral \ntask  of  all  aspects  of  the  work.  Component  4  will  help  EPC  (i)  improve  longer-term  least-cost \nplanning;  (ii)  ensure  that  investments  are  affordable  and  contribute  to  improving  financial \nsustainability; and (iii) improve the transparency of costs, tariff setting, and accountability to the \nGovernment and consumers.   \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  cluster  is  estimated  to  be  $2,185,000  equivalent.  The \n8. \nGovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $1,850,000  equivalent.  Table  A11.1  shows  the \nfinancing  by  component.  The  equivalent  of  $350,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nGovernment  of  Finland;  $900,000  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  of  Australia; \n$600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan.

Despite  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks, the Independent State of Samoa has experienced stable economic growth over the last \n5  years.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  around  4%  per  annum,  well  above  the \naverage  growth  rate  of  the  Pacific  region  economies.  The  annual  long-term  growth  rate  is \nexpected  to  be  around  3.5%.  Economic  growth  is  mainly  driven  by  agriculture,  construction, \nfinance,  and  business services.  Samoa  is  also  benefiting  from  an  increase  in  tourism.  Further \nbroadening  of  economic  activity  and  private  sector  development  are  key  strategies  for \nsustaining economic growth rates and reducing poverty.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2005\u20132007  lays  the \n2. \nfoundation  for  sustainable  and  broad-based  economic  growth  supported  by  continued  reforms \nand private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Samoa. Ensuring \nthat  sufficient  power  is  available  to  meet  growing  demand  is  essential  to  achieving  a  broader \neconomic base and reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. \n \nA. \n\nPower Demand and Supply Balances \n\nThe power sector in Samoa has undergone a rapid transformation over the last decade \n3. \ntowards an energy supply based on imported petroleum and hydropower-generated electricity. \nThis  transformation  has  been  driven  by  economic  growth  that  has  resulted  in  increasing \ndemand  for  electricity  and  transportation.  Energy  demand  in  Samoa  is  met  by  three  main \nsources:  biomass  (47%),  fossil  fuel  (45%),  and  hydropower  (8%).  Biomass  is  mainly  used  for \ncooking whereas imported petroleum is used for transportation and power generation. Imports \nof petroleum products account for 15% of Samoa\u2019s total import expenditure. Power generation \naccounts for about 20% of total imported petroleum. \n \n4. \nMore than 90% of the country\u2019s electricity demand is on Upolu, which is also the main \nsource  of  growth  in  Samoa.  Peak  electricity  demand  reached  17.6  megawatts  (MW)  in  2007. \nAnnual  peak  demand  is  expected  to  grow  by  7%  in  the  short  term  and  by  4%  beyond  2009 \n(Table A12.1). By 2008, the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) will not be able to reliably meet \n1 In the short term, EPC will utilize existing self-generation by large consumers to meet \ndemand.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n2  By  2010,  the  existing  run-of-the-river  hydropower  station  at  Alaoa  will  be \npeak  demand.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nrefurbished  and  by  2011  EPC  will  need  to  commission  additional  generation  capacity  to  meet \nboth energy and peak demands.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Assumes a reliability criteria of the available capacity minus the capacity of the largest generator. \n2   The capacity of existing self-generation is estimated to be about 8 MW. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.1: Power Balance - Upolu System  \n(Without-Investment Plan) \n  \n\nYear \n\nPeak \nDemand \n(MW) \n\nTotal Firm \nGeneration \nCapacity \n(MW) \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n24.6 \n22.8 \n22.8 \n\nFirm \nCapacity at \nN-1 Reserve \n(MW) \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.5 \n20.3 \n18.5 \n18.5 \n\nPower \nBalance \nat N-1 \n(MW) \n4.7 \n4.6 \n4.3 \n3.6 \n3.0 \n0.9 \n(0.3) \n(1.4) \n(4.1) \n(5.0) \n\nReserve Firm \nGeneration \nCapacity \n(MW) \n8.8 \n8.7 \n8.4 \n7.7 \n7.1 \n5.0 \n3.8 \n2.9 \n0.2 \n(0.7) \n\n15.8 \n15.9 \n16.2 \n17.0 \n17.6 \n19.7 \n20.8 \n21.7 \n22.6 \n23.5 \n\n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \nMW = megawatt, N-1 = total generation capacity minus the largest generator.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank (ADB) and EPC. \n \n5. \nPeak demand on Savai\u2019i is expected to grow by 4% annually to 2009. With a longer-term \ngrowth  in  peak  demand  of  3%,  the  existing  diesel  power  station  at  Salalologa  is  estimated  to \nmeet  capacity  and  annual  energy  requirements  until  2015,  when  a  0.4  MW  generator  is \nscheduled for retirement. A power factor improvement project has been scheduled for 2010 to \nimprove  operational  efficiency.  A  hydropower  development,  scheduled  for  commissioning  in \n2015,  is  a  key  priority  to  reduce  diesel  consumption  on  Savai\u2019i.  If  the  proposed  hydropower \ndevelopment project can be commissioned, 81% of energy requirements on Savai\u2019i can be met \nfrom  renewable  resources  in  2015.  The  Project  will  also  reduce  noise  and  pollution  from  the \npower station.  \n \nB. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n6. \nThe  investment  plan  covers  the  two  power  systems  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  EPC\u2019s \ninvestment plan will meet forecast demand requirements up until 2019, when new capacity will \nbe required on Upolu, and help EPC improve its collection performance through the installation \nof prepayment meters. The investment plan comprises three generation and nine transmission \nprojects on Upolu, and one generation and three transmission projects on Savai\u2019i. Investment in \nsingle- and three-phase prepayment meters, system control and data acquisition (SCADA), and \nportable equipment for measuring voltage and current and for stream-flow gauging are included \nfor both the Upolu and Savai\u2019i power systems.  \n \n7. \nIdentified generation projects are based on analysis of the power and energy balances \nfor each of the power systems. Investments in the transmission networks are driven by the need \nto  improve  reliability,  reduce  losses,  and  meet  peak  requirements,  and  have  been  identified \nbased on detailed load-flow analysis of the performance of individual transmission lines, and the \nsystem as a whole. The timing of investments in generation on Upolu is initially driven by peak \ncapacity requirements. The existing generation capacity can meet energy requirements to 2013 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n65\n\n3 Investment in hydropower generation on \nwhen a 1.3 gigawatt-hour (GWh) shortfall is expected.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nSavai\u2019i  aims  to  replace  fuel  costs  of  the  existing  power  station  at  Salalologa.  The  timing  of \ncommissioning of the hydropower project is determined based on the need for adequate time to \naddress community concerns, and the financial and implementation capacity of EPC.  \n \n8. \nProjects  under  the  investment  plan  are  prioritized  to  improve  reliability  and  security  of \npower  supply  to  the  main  load  center  in  Apia  and  to  improve  EPC\u2019s  revenue  collection.  EPC \nplans  to  improve  utilization  of  the  existing  transmission  system,  and  reliability  of  supply,  by \nreplacing  the  existing  6.6  kilovolt  (kV)  overhead  transmission  lines  with  a  22  kV  underground \ncable.  This  is  the  first  phase  of  a  three-phase  underground  program  that  aims  to  secure \nelectricity  supply  to  the  main  load  centers  and  the  hospital,  and  protect  the  key  transmission \nlines against cyclone damage. The underground program is expected to be fully completed by \n2013. EPC\u2019s revenue collection will be improved through the installation of prepayment meters \nto  all  consumers  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i.  The  supply,  installation,  and  operation  of  the  SCADA \nsystem  will  enhance  the  control  systems  and  improve  operational  system  efficiency  on  both \nSavai\u2019i and Upolu. Transmission upgrades and expansion of the low voltage distribution network \nwill take place throughout the investment plan, commencing in 2008. EPC\u2019s investment plan is \ndetailed in Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix G.       \n \nC. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n9. \nProjects under the investment plan were included and sequenced to account for EPC\u2019s \nfinancial  and  implementation  capacity.  Feasible  alternatives  for  the  proposed  generation \nprojects  are  limited.  The  generation  projects  included  for  expansion  on  Upolu  include  the \nrefurbishment  of  the  existing  1  MW  Alaoa  hydropower  station  by  2010  and  a  new  12.9  MW \ndiesel  power  station  for  which  commissioning  of  three  4.3  MW  diesel  generators  would  be \nsequenced between 2011 and 2014. Up until 2011, EPC may face capacity shortages in reliably \nmeeting  peak  demand  during  the  dry  season.  Utilization  of  existing  stand-by  self-generation \ncapacity  enables  EPC  to  manage  the  risk  of  capacity  shortages  until  adequate  transmission \ncapacity  has  been  commissioned.  Two  possible  hydropower  sites  at  Lotofagauta  and  Tia'vea \nwere identified on Upolu. However, given technical, capacity, cost, and social uncertainties with \nthese projects, they were not included in EPC\u2019s investment plan for 2008\u20132015.  \n \n10. \nA  least-cost  analysis  for  generation  options  on  Savai\u2019i  was  undertaken  to  ascertain \nwhether the proposed 1 MW firm capacity run-of-the-river hydropower scheme would represent \nthe least economic cost option for meeting demand to 2030. The capital costs include cost for \nresettlement  and  land  acquisition.  Taxes,  duties,  and  value-added  government  sales  tax  were \nexcluded for all capital, insurance, and operations and maintenance costs.  \n \n11. \nAverage  annual  output  is  estimated  at  11.8  GWh,  which  would  provide  96%  of \ngeneration  requirements  on  Savai\u2019i  in  2015.  With  demand  growth,  the  share  of  hydropower \nwould  reduce  to  75%  by  2020.  The  balance  of  generation  requirements  would  be  met  by  the \nexisting  diesel  power  station,  which  would  mostly  be  used  to  meet  peak  demand.  The  hydro-\ndiesel mix option was compared to a diesel-only option, where the existing power station would \nbe maintained to meet demand growth to 2030. Commencing in 2015, 3,355 tons (t) of diesel \nfuel would be saved annually; by 2017, savings would increase to 3,446 t annually. The result of \nthe  least-cost  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  A12.2.

The  program  will  commence  in  2008  and  be  fully  completed  by  the  end  of  2014.  It \nincludes (i) two stages of upgrading and underground cabling of the existing 6.9 kilometers (km) \nof  the  Hospital  Feeder  (1.1  km  of  which  is  currently  underground),  (ii)  upgrading  the  capacity \nand  underground  cabling  of  the  Vaitele  Feeder,  and  (iii)  underground  cabling  of  a  new  22  kV \ntransmission  line  from  the  proposed  Vaitele  Substation  to  the  wharf  area  and  through  the \nindustrial area at Vailima to the airport.  \n \n13. \nThe  first  stage  of  the  Hospital  Feeder  upgrade  will  improve  utilization  of  the  Vaitele \nFeeder and reduce the load on the Hospital Feeder. Load-flow analysis show that the Hospital \nFeeder  is  currently  experiencing  overloads  and  voltage  drops,  and  is increasingly becoming  a \nbottleneck to reliable electricity supply both to Apia\u2019s main commercial and government district \nand to the hospital. By 2011, overloading on this transmission line will be 30% and the voltage \ndrops will have increased from 11% in 2006 to 20% by 2016, when the overloading will be about \n70%. Losses are estimated to increase from 6% in 2006 to 11% by 2016.  \n \n14. \nSince the early 1990s, Samoa has experienced four serious cyclones. The two cyclones \nin  the  early  1990s  caused  damage  estimated  at  $120  million  (26%  of  GDP)  and  $200  million \n(46% of GDP). With global warming, the incidence and severity of cyclones can be expected to \nincrease  in  the  future.  The  2004  cyclone  caused  damage  to  key  infrastructure  assets  alone \nestimated  at  $25  million,  excluding  the  cost  to  the  power  sector  and  impacts  on  economic \nactivity. EPC estimated the cost of damage to power sector assets at $2.8 million in addition to \na loss of 2.73% of total sales for 2004.  \n \n15. \nThe difference in economic net present value costs for the underground cabling program \nversus overhead transmission lines is $4.04 million. Assuming that the costs of damage from a \ncyclone  would  amount  to  25%  of  the  investment  cost  in  overhead  transmission  lines,  it  would \ntake about two cyclone events for the underground program to become least cost. Cost saving \nassociated  with  the  longer  economic  life  of  underground  cables,  reduced  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, and loss of economic production and activity, including the opportunity cost \nof self-generation caused by disruptions in power supply associated with cyclone damage, have \nbeen excluded from the analysis. Underground cabling of key transmission lines forms part of \nthe  Government\u2019s  national  risk  management  strategy  to  improve  resilience  against  natural \nhazards and climate change.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n67\n\n16. \nAs subprojects included under the investment plan are not stand-alone investments that \nyield  benefits  in  isolation  from  other  investments,  the  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for \nEPC\u2019s  two  power  systems  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i  using  a  time-slice  approach.  The  analysis  is \nconducted  from  2008  to  2030  with  an  investment  period  from  2008  to  2015.  The  economic \ncapital  costs  include  investment  costs  and  costs  for  project  management  and  implementation, \nenvironment  management  and  mitigation,  and  resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  It  was \nassumed that the economic opportunity cost of land is 25% of the financial compensation.   \n \n17. \nThe net economic benefits for the two power systems on Upolu and Savai\u2019i were derived \nby  comparing  the  performance  of  the  power  systems  on  Upolu  and  Savai\u2019i  under  a  with-\ninvestment plan scenario and a without-investment plan scenario. On Upolu, 97% of the capital \ncost  for  prepayment  meters  and  78%  of  the  SCADA  costs  and  project  management  and \nimplementation  were  allocated  to  the  system,  with  the  remaining  3%  of  the  capital  cost  for \nprepayment  meters  and  12%  of  SCADA  costs  and  project  management  and  implementation \nallocated  to  Savai\u2019i.  It  was  assumed  that  EPC  staff  costs  (the  second  largest  operation  and \nmaintenance  cost  after  fuel)  would  remain  the  same  under  both  the  with-investment  and \nwithout-investment scenarios.  \n \n18. \nIn  the  absence  of  an  investment  plan  on  Upolu,  the  economic  analysis  assumes  that \nEPC  would  serve  demand  from  its  existing  generation  capacity.  Unserved  demand  initially \nrepresents  deficits  in  peak  capacity.  The  transmission  system  will  become  an  increasing \nhindrance  to  power  supply  to  consumers  and  system  losses  will  increase  until  generation \n4 With  increased  system  losses  and  growing \ncapacity  reached  its  maximum  output  in  2017.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndemand,  energy  deficits  will  commence  in  2013.  Incremental  benefits  were  valued  at  the \n5 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwillingness to pay, estimated at ST0.99 per kWh.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfor the investments on Upolu is estimated at 13.6%. Benefits which are difficult to quantify, such \nas those associated with the noise and emission control program at the Tanugamanono power \nstation and with protection of transmission lines against climate change, have not been included \nin  the  analysis.  The  result  is  most  sensitive  to  the  estimated  capital  costs,  followed  by  the \nassumptions  of  benefits.  Capital  cost  increases  of  more  than  14%  would  make  the  EIRR  fall \nbelow 12%. A 20% reduction in benefits would reduce the EIRR to just below 12%.  \n \n19. \nThe  with-investment  scenario  on  Savai\u2019i  would  yield  benefits  associated  with  reduced \nfuel  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  an  annual  economic  benefit  of  $45,000  in \ncarbon-market credits associated with the reduced diesel usage resulting from the hydropower \nproject.  The  without-investment  scenario  assumes  that  no  new  investments  will  take  place  on \nSavai\u2019i.  Demand  would  be  met  by  the  existing  diesel  power  station  at  increased  fuel  and \noperation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  calculations  do  not  include  benefits  associated  with \nreduction of noise and fumes from the existing power station at Salalologa. The analysis under \nthe base-case fuel price (the equivalent of $60 per bbl) yields an EIRR of 10.7%. The result is \nmost sensitive to changes in operation and maintenance costs followed by capital costs. If the \ninternational  oil  price  over  the  period  averaged  $67  per  bbl,  the  EIRR  increases  to  12%.  A \ncapital cost increase of more than 4% would reduce the EIRR to below 10%. The details of the \neconomic analysis are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n                                                 \n4   The existing overhead lines to main load centers in Apia would also remain vulnerable to cyclones. \n5   The  methodology  for  calculating  the  willingness  to  pay  followed  the  approach  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and \nResearch Department Technical Note No.3, Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity. The estimated weighted \naverage willingness to pay for domestic and nondomestic consumers is ST0.99 ($0.388) per kWh. \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n20. \nThe financial analysis was undertaken based on a comparison of the financial costs and \nbenefits associated with the investment plan for the two separate power systems on Upolu and \nSavai\u2019i.  Financial  benefits  comprise  (i)  projected  revenue  based  on  tariff  projections,  (ii)  load \nforecasts, and (iii) estimated carbon credits of $45,000 per year. The incremental financial costs \ncomprise  capital,  operation  and  maintenance  (including  fuel),  and  system  losses.  Financial \nbenefits and costs were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated \nat 4.5% (Table A12.3). The WACC is calculated in real terms for EPC\u2019s investments for 2008\u2013\n2015.  The  financing  sources  comprise  EPC\u2019s  equity  contributions  (financed  through  retained \nearnings), the Government\u2019s equity contributions (financed by the Government of Australia), and \nforeign  exchange  loans  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) relent to EPC in local currency at an interest rate of 6.5%. The \ncost  of  EPC\u2019s  equity  is  estimated  at  15.2%  on  the  basis  of  a  risk-free  rate  of  9.6%  of  New \nZealand dollar denominated bonds issued by the Government of New Zealand, and adjusted for \nSamoa. Assumptions underlying the WACC computations include that EPC will not be required \nto pay tax, and an average domestic inflation of 3.6%.  \n \n\nItem  \n\nGovernment and \nEPC Equity \n\nTable A12.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nGovernment   \nRelending of Loans \nADB \n42 \n42.00 \n6.50 \n0.00 \n6.50 \n3.58 \n2.82 \n1.18 \n\nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting (%) \nNominal Cost (%) \nTax Rate (%) \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost (%) \nInflation Rate (%) \nReal Cost (%) \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (%) \n\n100 \n100 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n4.48\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EPC  =  Electric  Power  Corporation,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nJBIC \n38 \n38.00 \n6.50 \n0.00 \n6.50 \n3.58 \n2.82 \n1.07 \n\n20 \n20.00 \n15.20 \n0.00 \n15.15 \n3.58 \n11.16 \n2.23 \n\nTotal \n\n \nThe  financial  net  present  values  discounted  at  the  WACC  for  the  investment  plan  is \n21. \nST44.1 million ($17.3 million) for the investments on Upolu and ST27.9 million ($10.9 million) for \nSavai\u2019i.  The  financial  rates  of  returns  are  7.0%  for  Upolu  and  12.1%  for  Savai\u2019i.  The  financial \nresult  for  Upolu  is  most  sensitive  to  an  increase  in  capital  costs,  followed  by  a  reduction  in \nbenefits (sales). The investment plan would remain financially viable if capital cost increases do \nnot exceed 31%. The financial result for Savai\u2019i is most sensitive to changes in fuel prices, but \nthe  international  oil  price  would  need  to  drop  to  below  $27  per  bbl  to  undermine  financial \nviability.

Real gross domestic product grew at around 4% per annum, well above the average growth rate \nof the Pacific region economies. Economic growth is mainly driven by agriculture, construction, finance, and business \nservices.  Samoa  is  also  benefiting  from  an  increase  in  tourism.  Further  broadening  of  economic  activity  and  private \nsector development are key strategies for sustaining economic growth rates and reducing poverty. The Government\u2019s \nStrategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2005\u20132007  lays  the  foundation  for  sustainable  and  broad-based  economic \ngrowth supported by continued reforms and private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in \nSamoa.  Ensuring  that  sufficient  power  is  available  to  meet  growing  demand  is  essential  to  achieving  a  broader \neconomic base and reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. \n \nWith  the  rural  electrification  program  nearing  completion,  95%  of  the  population  has  access  to  electricity.  Good \nperformance of the power sector and reliable electricity services are vital for promoting private sector investments to \ndiversify  the  economy  and  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth.  Electricity  is  also  an  intermediate  input  to  the \nprovision  of  basic  social  services,  including  health,  education,  and  water  supply.  Inadequate  and  unreliable  power \nsupply  is  an  increasing  hindrance  to  economic  growth  and  is  affecting  all  consumers  in  Samoa.  Poor  people  are \ndisproportionately affected by poor reliability and quality of power supply, and by inefficiencies in the power sector.  \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe 2002 Household Income Expenditure Survey shows that a high proportion of households use electricity as a main \nsource  of  lighting.  The  average  household  consumption  is  76  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  month  and  electricity \nexpenditure  accounts  for  about  4%  of  average  household  expenditure  in  Samoa.  Affordability  of  appliances  is  the \nmajor determinant of electricity  demand, and electricity consumption is strongly correlated  with income. Poor people \ntypically spend comparatively more on electricity but generally consume small amounts of electricity for basic lighting \nand an electric fan. Access to the electricity grid has had significant expenditure-reducing effects for poor households, \nand  this  has  allowed  them  to  become  more  energy  efficient.  However,  with  deteriorating  quality  and  reliability  of \nsupply, the impact on poor households is disproportional as appliances need to be replaced more often.  \n \nThe Electric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) investment plan includes prepayment meters for all consumers on Savai\u2019i and \nUpolu.  Prepayment  meters  allow  households  to  be  more  aware  of  their  electricity  consumption  and  better  manage \ntheir consumption to match income streams. EPC has so far installed 1,200 prepayment meters on Upolu and social \nacceptance is high.  \n \nA  rapid  social  assessment  (RSA)  was  conducted  within  the  Sili  area  on  the  south  coast  of  Savai'i.  Community \nparticipation through key respondent interviews and focus-group discussions in the project areas highlighted several \nmajor perceived sector issues. \n(i)  Electricity  is  a  major  cost  to  most  households  in  Savai'i.  RSA  survey  data  analysis  showed  that  households  on \nSavai'i  allocate  on  average  10%  of  monthly  income  to  purchase  electricity.  Of  the  residential  households  surveyed, \n32% stated that they are unable to pay electricity bills on time due to household cash flow constraints, and 14% had \nhad  their  electricity  supply  disconnected  due  to  late  payment.  A  number  of  households  (16%)  stated  that  their \nneighbors had opted not to reconnect the electricity supply as they are unable to pay their monthly electricity bills. \n(ii)  The  majority  of  residential  and  commercial  consumers  (67%)  rated  the  quality  of  EPC\u2019s  services  as  good,  31% \nrated EPC's service as average, and 2% were dissatisfied. Survey respondents expressed concern over the growing \nfrequency of electricity supply interruptions and 84% stated that the quality of electricity services on Savai'i needs to \nimprove. During the second half of 2006, there were 32 power supply interruptions which lasted for an average of 40 \nminutes each. \n(iii) About 97.3% of the RSA respondents agreed that electricity is important to households and businesses because of \nthe benefits provided by electricity and its contribution to the maintenance of peace and order in the villages through \nthe provision of street lighting. Most households surveyed (74%) stated that they were unwilling to pay high electricity \ntariffs for improved electricity services. \n(iv) Perceived benefits of the electrical services include (a) prolonging the study time of school children, (b) savings on \nexpenses and making household chores convenient, (c) enjoyment in watching television programs or listening to \nradio programs, and (d) enhancement of skills which are dependent on electricity, such as refrigeration and electronic \nrepairs and steel fabrication. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was prepared as part of the community and household consultations for the Vaita'i Hydropower \nSubproject. A physical scale model  was displayed to the communities and used to explain the impacts of the Vaita'i \nhydropower project during a series of community meetings undertaken  in March 2007. A project information booklet \nwas provided in the Samoan language to ensure that the impacts of the project could be clearly understood. Separate \nconsultations  were  also  undertaken  with  women.  In  general,  affected  people  responded  positively  to  the  project  but \nconsensus has not been reached. Therefore, the project is postponed until 2013 or until such time as the communities \naccept the project. Until acceptable renewable generation sources can be developed on Savai\u2019i, the people of Savai\u2019i \nwill  have  access  to  electricity  supplied  from  the  existing  diesel  power  station  at  Salalologa.  EPC\u2019s  investment  plan \nincludes a control system and a power factor improvement project for the power system on Savai\u2019i. This is expected to \nlead to improvements in quality and reliability of electricity supply provided that existing diesel generators are operated \nand maintained adequately.  \n \nCandidate  subprojects  will  require  community  acceptance  prior  to  implementation.  An  environmental  and  social  unit \nwill be formed within EPC and will operate within the project management unit. The environmental and social unit will \nbe  responsible  for  stakeholder  consultations  and  manage  project  environmental,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement \nactivities. Project information booklets will be prepared for each candidate subproject and disclosed to affected people \nin the wider community. \n \nFurther  stakeholder  analysis  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the  power  sector  reform  in  order  to  fully  understand  and \ntake into account the views, interests, and impacts on all stakeholder groups. This analysis will be supported through \nthe technical assistance (TA) cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  participation  strategy  outlining  the  community  consultation  and  participation  framework  for  the  Power  Sector \nExpansion Project is included in the land acquisition and resettlement framework. EPC consults with landowners prior \nto  land  acquisition.  Representatives  from  EPC  inform  the  affected  parties,  in  advance,  of  EPC\u2019s  intention  to  acquire \nland  and  compensation  matters.  Further  consultations  take  place  during  and  after  detailed  design  and  prior  to  the \npreparation  of  a  full  census  of  affected  people  and  inventory  of  losses.  The  subproject  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plans  will  be  made  available  to  affected  people.  The  objectives  of  the  subproject,  the  amount  of  land \nrequired,  compensation  entitlements,  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  the \nlocal language.  \n \nThe TA cluster for Implementing the Samoa National Energy Policy incorporates the preparation and implementation \nof  stakeholder  participation  and  consultations  into  the  reform  process  and  awareness-building  for  development  of \nrenewables. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nCurrently, no specific adverse impacts to women are foreseen. The development of subprojects involves community \nconsultations and EPC will actively encourage representation by women at all public meetings to ensure that women \n(i) fully understand the subproject and its benefits, (ii) become involved in collective decision making, and (iii) raise the \nissues and concerns affecting them in respect to the subproject and identify suitable mitigation measures to address \nconcerns. \n \nSocial  investigations  show  that  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  are  adequately  catered  for  within  traditional  Samoan \nsociety and will receive an equitable share of any compensation. No specific remedial actions are thought necessary. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n\n   No: No Adverse gender impacts are foreseen. \n\n   Yes               \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n71 \n\nE.

For the core subprojects, no land \nacquisition  or  resettlement  effects  are  anticipated.  Future \nsubprojects  may  have  resettlement  impacts.  Procedures \nfor  land  acquisition  are  included  in  the  land  acquisition \nand resettlement framework prepared for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  objective \nof  providing  a  reliable  and  secure  electricity  supply  at \ncost-effective  prices.  More  frequent  and  timely  tariff \nadjustments  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  project \nbenefits are sustainable.  \n \nShort-term  employment  opportunities  may  be  generated \nduring the construction phase of the Project. Longer-term \nemployment  opportunities,  particularly \nthe  service \nsector,  could  also  be  generated  by  commercial  and \nindustrial development resulting from more reliable power \nsupply. \n \nThe  project  is  not  envisaged  to  have  any  impacts  on \nindigenous people. \n\nin \n\nNo other social project risks beyond land acquisition were \nidentified.  Community  acceptance  will  be  required  for  all \nsubprojects  financed  by  ADB  grant  and  loan,  JBIC  loan, \nand Government of Australia grant.  \n \nThe  stakeholder  communication  strategy  will  identify  and \npropose  remedies  to  social  risks  related  to  power  sector \nreforms.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n= \n= \n= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 09 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "ST1.00\n$1.00\n$1.00\nA$1.00\n$1.00\nY1.00\n", "tala (ST) \n", "$0.391 \nST2.558 \nA$1.119 \n$0.893 \nY117.41 \n$0.009   \n", "ADB \nADF \nAusAID \nCDM \nCEF \nCEO \nDNA \nDSR \nEARF \nEIRR \nEMMP \nEPC \nESU \nGDP \nGEF \nIEE \nJBIC \nLARF \nLARP \nMOF \nMWTI \nNAPA \nPEAR \nPMC \nPMU \nPPMS \nPSC \nPUMA \nRFMA \nRSA \nSCADA \nSFR \nSPREP \nSWA \nTA \nUNDP \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nclean  development mechanism \nClean Energy Fund \nchief executive officer \ndesignated national authority \ndebt-service ratio \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental monitoring and management plan \nElectric Power Corporation \nenvironment and social unit \ngross domestic product \nGlobal Environment Facility \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure \nNational Adaptation Program of Action \npreliminary environmental assessment report \nproject management committee \nproject management unit \nproject performance monitoring system \nproject steering committee \nplanning and urban management agency \nresident financial management advisors \nrapid social assessment \nsystem control and data acquisition \nself-financing ratio \nSecretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  \nSamoa Water Authority \ntechnical assistance \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n"]}
