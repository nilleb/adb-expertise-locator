The  MFF  was  designed to  support \nthe green power  development  and energy  efficiency  improvement  portion  of  the government\u2019s \nenergy  sector  investment  program  by  (i)  financing  hydropower  development,  (ii) expanding \ntransmission and medium-voltage infrastructure to improve network efficiency and enable power \nevacuation  of  renewable  energy \ninnovative  demand-side \nmanagement technologies, and (iv) supporting capacity building and project management. \n \n4. \nThrough a periodic financing request dated 19 August 2016, the government requested \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loans  totaling  $150  million  and  a  $30 million  equivalent  loan \nfrom  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  to  be  partially  administered  by  ADB  to  finance  the \nproject  2  outputs:  (i)  transmission  infrastructure  enhanced,  (ii)  medium-voltage  network \nefficiency  improved,  and  (iii)  demand-side  management  for  energy  efficiency  improved.5 The \nimpact  of  project  2 will  be  increased  access  to clean and  reliable  power  supply.  The  outcome \nwill be enhanced system efficiency and reliability. \n \n\nthe  system,  (iii) piloting \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \n\n5. \nThe proposed tranche is classified under environmental impact category A under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  220-kilovolt  Mannar\u2013Nadukuda  transmission  line \ninvolves  power  evacuation  from  planned  300-megawatt  wind  farms  and  passes  through  a \nRamsar wetland area for 7.5 kilometers.6 The project-affected area supports critical habitat. The \nproject  may  have  the  potential  for  adverse  impacts  on  the  Ramsar  wetland  and  the  migratory \nand congregatory water birds that the wetland supports. An environmental impact assessment \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Green Power Development and Energy \nEfficiency Improvement Investment Program.

Colombo. \n3   Nonconventional  renewable  energy  includes  mini  hydropower  (up  to  10-megawatt  capacity),  wind,  solar,  and \n\nbiomass. \n\n4   Ceylon Electricity Board. 2015. Statistical Digest 2014. Colombo. \n5   Periodic Financing Request Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix). \n6   The Ramsar wetland is designated by Sri Lanka under the Ramsar Convention that advocates for the conservation \nand wise use of wetlands. The proposed transmission line will pass through the wetland area following the route of \nthe old damaged 33-kilovolt line in parallel to the existing operational railway that also crosses the Ramsar area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\n(EIA) including an environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared to assess the potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts.7 The  EIA  was  informed  by  2-year  avifauna  and  marine  fauna \nsurveys  in  the  affected  area.  Avian  collision  risk  assessment  for  the  transmission  line  and the \nwind  farms,  as  associated  facilities,  was  carried  out.  Mitigation measures  are  proposed  in  the \nEIA  and  EMP  to  minimize  habitat  and  species  disturbance  as  a  result  of  construction  and \npotential  bird  collision  with  the  overhead  transmission  line.  Implementation  of  the  biodiversity \nmanagement  plan  will  ensure  no  net  loss  of  biodiversity.  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  (CEB),  the \nexecuting  agency,  has  committed  to  undertake  further  assessment  and  manage  the  impacts \nand  risks  of  bird  collision  with  wind  turbines  by  curtailment  during  the  breeding  and  migratory \nseason if necessary. The EIA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 July 2016. \n \n6. \nPotential environmental impacts of other transmission and distribution infrastructure are \nsite  specific;  mostly  temporary  during  construction;  and  readily  mitigated  by  adherence  to \nnational and international environmental standards, design criteria, and management practices \nas  set  out  in  the  EMP.  Sensitive  ecosystems  will  not  be  impacted.  Initial  environmental \nexamination  reports  including  relevant  EMPs  were  prepared  to  mitigate  the  potential  adverse \nimpacts  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  19  August  2016.  The  demand-side  management \noutput  will  have  minimal  environmental  footprint.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  safeguard \ndocuments  were  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  MFF\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and review framework, and Sri Lankan environmental regulations. \n \n7. \nPublic  consultations  on  the  transmission  line  and  the  first  phase  100-megawatt  wind \nfarm  were  conducted  with  local  communities,  government  authorities,  and  nongovernment \norganizations,  including  ornithological  societies,  and  their  feedback  was  taken  into  account \nduring project design. Public concerns were identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures were \nincorporated  in  the  EMP.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  set  up  at  project \ncommencement.  All  complaint-related  documentation  will  be  summarized  and  become  part  of \nthe environmental monitoring report that will be submitted to ADB. If the grievances cannot be \naddressed  through the grievance redress  mechanism, the  complainant  can  seek  legal  redress \nof  their  grievances  in  appropriate  courts.  Corrective  actions  will  be  taken  for  unanticipated \nimpacts and inadequate safeguard implementation. Consultations with project stakeholders will \ncontinue through the pre-construction, construction, and operation stages. \n \n8. \nCEB has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, and it established a project \nmanagement unit for the tranche. CEB will retain qualified and experienced external experts or \nqualified  nongovernment  organizations  to  verify  monitoring  information  on  the Mannar\u2013\nNadukuda transmission line. Contractors will be required to comply with the EMP during the pre-\nconstruction and construction stages under close monitoring of the external experts and CEB. In \ncase  the  implementation  of  EMP  measures  is  not  satisfactory,  the  external  consultants  will \nrecommend  actions  to  enhance  environmental  compliance.  CEB  will  provide  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB on a quarterly basis while works are ongoing within the Ramsar area \nand semiannually thereafter. These reports will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n\nIV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n9. \nThe  President  recommends  that  the  Board  authorize  the  conversion  of  $150,000,000 \ninto  a  tranche  to  finance  project  2  of  the  Green  Power  Development  and  Energy  Efficiency \nImprovement Investment Program in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n                                                \n7   Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix). \n\n\f     \n\nAppendix  \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=47037-005-MFF Tranche Report \n \n\nPeriodic Financing Request Report  \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: 220-kilovolt Mannar\u2013Nadukuda Transmission Line  \n\n \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 September 2016) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.00684 \nSLRs146.30 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCEB \nEIA \nEMP \nMFF \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCeylon Electricity Board \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental management plan \nmultitranche financing facility \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \nPeer reviewer \n", "W.
