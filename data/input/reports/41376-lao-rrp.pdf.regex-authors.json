This  first-time  program \nsupport to Lao PDR's health sector will help the Ministry of Health \nmove toward a sector program approach. The combined outputs are \n(i)  strengthened  planning  and  financing;  (ii)  increased  access  to \nmaternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care; and (iii) improved \nquality of human resources for health (HRH).  \n   \nRationale  Starting from a low base, the country\u2019s health indicators still lag behind \nthose  of  most  other  countries in Asia  and  the  Pacific. Challenges \ninclude widespread poverty, isolated populations, limited public sector \ncapacity, and low public financing. The sector will remain dependent \non external funding until domestic revenues from Nam Theun 2 and \nother sources become substantial, around 2020.   \n \nA PHC network has been put in place, and access to basic health care \nhas  been  substantially  improved  through  a  network  of  district \nhospitals,  health  centers,  and  village  health  volunteers  with  drug \nrevolving funds. However, health services are seriously underfunded \nand often lack skilled personnel, high out-of-pocket fees deter the poor \nfrom using services, and appropriate services for women and some \nethnic groups are often lacking.   \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  poverty  and  achieving \nMDGs, and has identified the health sector as one of four priority \nsectors. The 7th Health Sector Development Plan is to be supported by \na  results-based  sector  program  approach  and  will  focus  on  eight \npriority areas, including the model healthy village, safe motherhood, \nchild survival, nutrition and emerging diseases, HRH, management, \nfinancing, and aid coordination.  \n \nIn line with the Lao PDR country partnership strategy, the Program \nconsolidates  ADB\u2019s  past  investments  in  PHC  in  eight  northern \nprovinces  and  provincial  health  management  countrywide,  and \n ", "ii   \nresponds  to  the  Government's  efforts  and  ADB's  commitment  to \nimplement the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.   \n \nThe Program will provide a platform for the sector program approach \nfor  support  from  other  partners.  The  sector  development  program \nmodality  provides  support  for  policy  reforms  and  technical  and \nfinancial resources to implement reforms.   \n \nIn addition, ADB will provide capacity building technical assistance for \nfinancial  management  in  the  health  sector  to  help  implement  the \nsector  program  approach.  In  public  administration,  ADB  will  also \ncontinue  to  support  the  preparation  of  Lao  PDR's  medium-term \nexpenditure framework and public expenditure management.  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the HSDP will be reduced maternal and child mortality \nOutcome  and malnutrition by 2015. The outcome will be improved use of PHC, \nin particular for the poor, women and children, and ethnic groups.  \n   \nProgram Grant  The program grant supports reforms for (i) strengthened provincial \nplanning and financing, including an increase in nonsalary recurrent \nbudget,  standards  and  guidelines  for  hospitals,  a  national  health \ninformation system, and rolling out health equity funds; (ii) increased \naccess to MNCH care through a national MNCH strategy, and rolling \nout  mother-  and  child-friendly  health  services  and  model  healthy \nvillages; and (iii) improved quality of personnel through a national HRH \npolicy and skilled birth attendance plan. The Government is committed \nto  releasing  the  equivalent  of  program  funds  to  the  provinces  for \nnonsalary recurrent budget support for operation and maintenance; \noutreach;  staff  improvement;  and  for  rolling  out  mother-  and \nchild-friendly health services, model healthy villages, and health equity \nfunds.   \n   \nGrant Amount,  ADB will provide a program grant of $10 million from its Special Funds \nTerms, and  resources to be released in two tranches ($5 million each), subject to \nTranching  compliance with grant conditions as provided in the policy matrix, with \nthe first tranche to be released upon grant effectiveness and a second \ntranche within 24 months post-effectiveness.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The size of the program grant is based on the medium-term costs of \nproposed policy actions with an estimated adjustment cost of $15 \nmillion for the reforms. The Government will pass on the equivalent of \nthe program funds from the Ministry of Finance to the provinces using \na program fund mechanism.   \n   \nProgram Period  1 January 2010\u201330 June 2012. \nProcurement  The  program  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding items included on a list of ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The grant \n ", "  iii\nrecipient will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the \namount of ADB's projected disbursements under the program grant in \na  given  period.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  grant \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the recipient's certification. \n   \nProject Grant  The project grant will support the program outputs through specific \ninvestments and assistance for the implementation of the reforms. The \nProject  will  help  strengthen  provincial  planning  and  budgeting  for \nresults-based program support; increase access to MNCH services by \nimproving four hospitals and 45 health centers; increase in-service \ntraining  especially  for  skilled  birth  attendants;  upgrade  training \nprograms for PHC workers; improve pre-service training; and help roll \nout  priority  programs  for  mother  and  child-friendly  services,  model \nhealthy villages, and provincial health equity funds. \n   \nCost Estimates  The project cost is estimated at $10.8 million, including physical and \nprice contingencies, duties, and taxes.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10.0  million  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  to  cover  93%  of  the  project  cost.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $0.8 million for taxes, duties, and in-kind services.   \n  \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount \nAsian Development Banka  10.0 \nGovernment  0.8 \n  Total  10.8 \na Asian Development Fund grant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nPeriod of  1 January 2010\u201330 June 2014 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Health,  through  its \nArrangements   Department of Planning and Finance. Within the ministry, program \nimplementation will be delegated to concerned departments acting as \nnational  implementing  agencies,  including  the  departments  of \nCurative, Food and Drugs, and Organization and Personnel, and the \nMNCH Hospital. Provincial health offices, through the provincial PHC \ncoordination  units,  will  act  as  provincial  implementing  agencies.  A \nMinistry of Health steering committee will provide overall guidance in \nproject implementation. A sector-wide coordination mechanism is in \nplace with the support of the World Health Organization and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nWorks,  goods,  and  services  totaling  $100,000  and  above  will  be \n ", "iv   \nprocured through national competitive bidding. Minor works, goods, \nand services costing less than $100,000 may be procured through \nshopping. Vehicles may be procured through the United Nations Office \nfor Project Services, as its procurement procedures are acceptable to \nADB. \n   \nConsulting  The HSDP will require five international consultants for a total of 39 \nServices  person-months,  six  national  consultants  for  a  total  of  71 \nperson-months, and two national firms for architecture and accounting. \nThe  international  experts  in  program  management  (20 \nperson-months),  MNCH  (3  person-months),  medical  education \ndevelopment  (7  person-months),  gender  (6  person-months),  and \nhealth  equity  funds  (3  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual \nconsultants,  with  advance  action  for  engaging  the  planning  and \nfinancing expert. Accounting and architecture firms will be hired using \nbiodata technical proposal and consultant qualification selection. Other \nnational  consultants  will  be  hired  as  individual  consultants.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The Program will have significant impacts on the health of the poor, \nand Beneficiaries  women and children, and ethnic groups, as it will address core issues \nin operationalizing the PHC system that has been put in place. In the \nshort term, recurrent budget support will improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of service delivery, increasing coverage and impact. In the \nmedium to long term, better access to affordable quality services and \nimproved village health will have a major impact on progress towards \nthe MDGs, life expectancy, and public health.    \n   \nRisks and  Very  low,  nonsalary  recurrent  expenditure  in  the  health  sector \nAssumptions  seriously affects the performance of health services and outreach. \nWhile increasing Government revenue from Nam Theun 2 and other \nsources will improve health sector financing in the long term, bridge \nfunding  is needed  for  the coming  10  years.  The  Government  has \ncommitted  to  provide  the  equivalent  of  program  support  to  the \nprovinces for nonsalary recurrent budget support. \n \nExpected  technical  efficiency  gains  from  increased  capacity  in \nplanning and financial management will position the Ministry of Health \nfor approval of Nam Theun 2 proposals for future recurrent funding for \nhealth sector operational expenses. \n \nThe program funding modality and fund-flow mechanism for the health \nsector  have  been  endorsed  by  the  Government,  but  the  funding \nmechanism still needs to be put in place. ADB will provide capacity \nbuilding technical assistance to develop the fund-flow mechanism and \nto  strengthen  financial  management  capacity  of  the  provinces \ndeveloped through previous projects. \n ", "102 o 00'E 106 o 00'E\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA Gnot-Ou LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nHEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nPhongsali\nBoun Nua\nPHONGSALI\nSamphan\nN M ARRiver Sing Boun Tai Mai\nM YAMekong  LLOouULaAonnNgg-GN-aNmAtMhaTHA Namo La Khoua\nMBoamn BMOeKuEngOViangphoukha Xai NambakNgoy Et XiaSnogpkbhaoo\nTonpheung Nale OUDOMXAI Namthouam Viangkham Xam-Nua\nHouayxay Beng LOUANGPHRABANG Viengxai\nPha-Oudom Nga Houa-Muang\nPakxeng HOUAPHAN\n20 o 00'N Houn Pak-Ou Viengthong 20 o 00'N\nPaktha Pakbeng Chomphet Phonxai Et Xam-Tai\nLouangphrabang\nKhopXianghon Hongsa Xiang-Ngeun Kham\nNgeun Phoukout\nPhoukhoun\nXaignabouli Nan Pek Nonghet\nPhaxai Khoun VIET  NAM\nPhiang Kasi VIENTIANE XMIAoNk-GMKaiH OUANG\nXaisomboun Thathom\nGulf   of   Tonkin\nXAIGNABOULI Vangvieng\nMet BOLIKHAMXAI\nFuang Non Hai Hom Bolikhan\nKeo-Oudom Viangthong\nThongmixai Phonhong Thaphabat Pakxan\nThoulakhom\nSangthong Pakkading Khamkeut\nPaklay Naxaythong VIENTIANE Mai Pak-Ngum\nSikhottabong Xaithani\nBoten XanakhamChVaInEthNaXTbaIoiAsueNlittEha SisHatatatxnaaykfong HinbouKnHAMMONUaAkaNy\nKenethao CAPITAL THAILAND MekonTg hRaivkerheGknommalat MahaxaiBoualapha\nXebangfai Xaibouathong\nNongbok\nAtsaphon Vilabouly\nXaibouly\nOuthoumphon Atsaphangthong Xepon\nPhalanxai\nN Kaysone Phomvihane ChamphoXnonbouri Phin Nong\nSAVANNAKHET\nXaiphouthong Songkhon Samouay\n16 o 00'N 0 50 100 Thapangthong Ta-Oy 16 o 00'N\nToumlan\nKilometers Lakhonpheng Vapi SaLavan Kalum\nKhongxedon SALAVAN XEKONG\nNational Capital Thateng\nProvincial Capital Sanasomboun Lao-Ngam Lamam Dakchung\nCity/Town Bachiangchaleunsouk Sanxai\nPakxong\nNational Road Pakxe\nPhonthong\nXaisettha\nPaved Provincial Road Champasak Pathoumphon Samakkhixai\nRiver\nATTAPEU\nSoukhouma Sanamxai\nDistrict Boundary CHAMPASAK\nPhouvong\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary Mounlapamok\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a (i) proposed \nprogram grant, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) for the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP). The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Country Context \n \n2.  The  Lao  PDR  has  made  significant  but  uneven  progress  toward  its  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).1 With the overarching goal of poverty reduction, the 6th National  \nSocio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010, identifies the health sector as one of four \npriority sectors.2 The Government of the Lao PDR has requested that the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  support  the  health  sector  with  a  sector  program  approach  to  improve  sector \nperformance toward MDGs, in line with the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.3 The \nHSDP is included in the country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011, for $20 million in 2009.4 \n \n3.  The Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. However, its average \nper capita income increased from $335 in 2000 to $491 in 2005, then to an estimated $840 in \n2008. Overall income poverty declined from 46% in 1992 to 27% in 2008,5 but economic growth \nhas been primarily urban.6  \n \n4.  The country is in transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy, and \neconomic growth is being driven by already completed investments and expansion of outputs. In \nthe last decade, the Lao PDR\u2019s annual gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate \nof 7.2%.7 Real gross domestic product growth is projected to decline to 5.5% in FY2009 due to \nfalling commodity prices, declining exports, and a marked decrease in the garments and tourism \nsectors. In-migration of low-income workers has put more strain on the labor market, and low \nelectricity demand caused a delay in major hydropower project construction.  \n \n5.  The global economic crisis has also added to the Government's budget deficit,8 following \nemergency spending for flooding and oil price mitigation in 2008. The Government is planning to \nbridge the revenue gap through a range of measures, including seeking additional external aid, \nand estimates that additional external aid totaling $50 million\u2013$60 million is needed in FY2010.  \n                                                 \n1  Committee for Planning and Investment, Government of the Lao PDR. 2008.

Sector Progress \n \n6.  In  2009,  the  Lao  PDR  has  an  estimated  population  of  6.2  million,  and  an  annual \npopulation growth rate of 2%.9 Its rural population is highly scattered, with an average density of \n24 people per square kilometer\u2014much less than neighboring countries\u2014resulting in substantial \nin-migration. Fully 73% of its people live in rural areas scattered over 10,552 villages in 17 \nprovinces and 141 districts. The Lao mainly live in the valleys of the Mekong River and its \ntributaries.  Small  ethnic  groups,  about  30%  of  the  population,  live  in  more  remote  and \nmountainous locations, are often poor, and have limited access to services and markets.  \n \n7.  Between 1990 and 2005, the Lao PDR\u2019s child mortality rate reduced substantially from \n170 to 98 per 1,000 live births, putting the country on track to achieve its MDG of 55 per 1,000 \nlive births in 2015. Sadly, newborn deaths (i.e., deaths within the first month after birth) still \naccount for nearly one half of infant mortality and nearly one third of child mortality. Child \nmalnutrition remains high, with an underweight rate of 37% in 2006, compared with a target of \n20% in 2015. The maternal mortality rate also decreased from 750 to 405 per 100,000 live births \nbetween 1990 and 2005, but the country is still likely to miss its target of 185 per 100,000 live \nbirths in 2015. Between 2000 and 2005, the total fertility rate declined from 4.9 to 4.1 children \nper woman, and the contraceptive prevalence rate has doubled in 10 years to about 40%. Less \nthan one quarter of women is attended by skilled health personnel when giving birth.  \n \n8.  Infections still cause the major burden of diseases in the Lao PDR, with malaria as the \nmost  often  reported  cause  of  illness.  With  support  from  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria, malaria incidence has been reduced to 0.4%. While 87% of children \nbelow age 5 years sleep under a bed net, only 43% sleep under an insecticide-treated net.10 Of \nchildren  less  than  age  1  year,  70%  are  immunized  against  measles,  but  a  much  smaller \nproportion is fully immunized.11 With increasing connectivity in the subregion, the country has \nseen an increase in its HIV/AIDS prevalence. Further, emerging diseases and dengue fever \noutbreaks, road accidents, and welfare diseases have put new demands on underresourced \nhealth services. \n \n9.  Under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health (MOH), the last decade saw significant \nexpansion  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  health  services  network,  including  hospitals,  health  centers, \noutreach, village health care, and associated programs. In the Lao PDR, there are 4 central, 4 \nspecialized, 4 regional, 12 provincial, and 126 district hospitals. Due to low population density, \ndistrict hospitals have relatively small catchment populations of 10,000\u201350,000 people. Only 26 \n\u201ctype A\u201d district hospitals provide emergency surgery, unlike 100 \u201ctype B\u201d district hospitals. The \n789  health  centers  serve  small  catchment  populations  of  1,000\u20135,000  people.  One  health \ncenter serves as a focal service point for about eight villages, including for obstetric care. MOH \nalso operates centrally managed priority programs linked to a specific MOH department12 and \noften also specific development partners, especially for maternal, newborn, and child health \n(MNCH) and communicable disease control.  \n \n10.  Villages  have  a  village  health  committee  to  ensure  a  healthy  village  environment, \nadequate village health care, and timely referral of emergencies. If it is more than a 2-hour \n                                                 \n9  National Statistical Centre of the Lao PDR. 2005. Population Census 2005.

There are 5,668 \nvillages (54%) with drug kits. Members of mass organizations like the Lao Front for National \nConstruction and Lao Women\u2019s Union volunteer as peer educators for health and nutrition \npromotion.  Village  private  providers  include  former  paramedics,  drug  shop  owners,  and \ntraditional healers. Licensed private providers are mostly located in urban areas.  \n11.  Despite this extensive network, the overall use of health services remains low. Data from \nthe 2008 health information system suggest that there were 0.3 outpatient visits per 1,000 \npopulation per year at all public health facilities in the Lao PDR, compared to international \nstandards of 1\u20132 interactions with a health facility per year. Bed occupancy rates average 40%, \nand the capacity of health infrastructure in the Lao PDR exceeds its current use. MOH is facing \na major challenge to make the system more effective, efficient, equitable, and sustainable to \nhelp achieve MDGs by 2015.  \n \n12.  Data from 1999 to 2008 in eight northern provinces illustrate primary health care (PHC) \nprogram impact on utilization by the poor. VHVs with drug kits have substantially improved \naccess to basic care for both the lowest and second-lowest quintiles, as well as ethnic groups.13 \nAbout 75% of these provinces\u2019 population have access to safe water, surpassing MDG targets. \nFurther, a 50% access rate to latrines will likely achieve the MDG target.14 However, health \nservices remain relatively less used, particularly by women and children. Overall, reaching \nMDGs will require more resources to reach lagging communities and households.  \n \n13.  Total health expenditure has increased from about $12 to $19 per person between 2005 \nand 2009,15 compared to an international standard of $34 for developing countries in 2000. The \nincrease is mostly due to higher household out-of-pocket spending. The share of domestically \nfinanced government health spending in total health expenditure was 9.7% in 2005. External aid \nhas kept the share of government health spending in total health expenditures at 33.7%, with \nthe remaining 66.3% coming from out-of-pocket expenditures. In real terms, public spending \nhas remained almost constant at around $30 million per year (in current 2009 dollars), or $5\u2013$6 \nper capita from FY2003 to FY2007, with the exception of FY2005 due to an increase in external \naid.16 Domestic spending increased from $12.6 million in FY2003 to $16.8 million in FY2007, \nand this trend is continuing. This increase is mainly for actual wage increases as the health \nworkforce remained more or less constant. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n  3.  Sector Plans, Policies, and Priorities \n \n14.  The 6th National Socio-Economic Development Plan identifies health as one of four \npriority sectors for development. The Health Policy and Strategy up to the Year 2020 (2000)17 \nand Primary Health Care policy (2000)18 formulate a vision of achieving health for all through a \nnational public health system based on the principles of PHC and model healthy villages. The \nGovernment is aiming for mandated, universal coverage of the population with health insurance \n                                                 \n13 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 1999.

Public financing and provision of services will \ncontinue to be required in the future given high levels of poverty, considerable market failure, \nand  limited  private  sector  capacity,  especially  in  remote  areas.  With  new  legislation,  the \nGovernment is also encouraging nongovernment organization and private sector development, \nand urban areas have seen a considerable increase in private practitioners.  \n \n15.  MOH is currently implementing the 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).19 \nA midterm review of the plan in September 2008 identified eight priorities: (i) model healthy \nvillages, (ii) maternal mortality reduction, (iii) child survival, (iv) nutrition and preparedness, (v) \nhuman  resources  for  health  (HRH),  (vi)  organization  and  management,  (vii)  health  care \nfinancing,  and  (viii)  aid  harmonization.  MOH  is  also  preparing  the  7th  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Plan (2011\u20132015), which is being planned and budgeted from districts upwards. \nThis plan will contain the objectives, priorities, strategies, targets, and medium-term expenditure \nprojections for each province and MOH to meet MDG targets for health over the next 5 years.  \n \n16.  MOH has introduced a range of policies to guide health sector reforms, as summarized \nin Appendix 2. Particularly relevant for village care are the national nutrition policy (approved in \n2008) and a decree on model healthy villages (2009). These policies should help address the \npersistently high malnutrition rate of about 30% and improve overall health status through better \nvillage environments, village health care, social safety nets, and timely referrals. Second, MOH \nand partners have prepared The National Strategy for MNCH 20 to improve MNCH delivery, \nincluding timely referrals and access to emergency obstetric care. MOH has also prepared a \ndraft national HRH policy to improve staff skills, quality, and distribution. Further, MOH is \naddressing the issue of cost recovery by rolling out provincial health equity funds for the poor. A \nnew health financing policy is scheduled for 2011 to address more long-term solutions for health \nfinancing, universal health insurance, and aid harmonization. While these reforms are potentially \nbeneficial toward achieving MDGs and putting the health sector on a more sustainable footing, \nthe sector is relatively late to develop. Moreover, there are multiple managerial, technical, and \nfinancing constraints in implementing these policies and plans.  \n \n17.  MOH is proposing that the 7th Health Sector Development Plan form the basis for a \nsector program approach in line with the Vientiane Declaration. ADB is a leading partner in \nimplementing the Vientiane Declaration and is committed to increasing program-based lending. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) \nhave been assisting MOH with the establishment of an aid coordination mechanism.21 MOH and \nits development partners have endorsed a new sector-wide coordination framework for health, \nand  there  is  general  agreement  on  the  way  forward  (Appendix  2,  Table  A2.2)  to  a  joint \nformulation, management, and monitoring of a single sector program. Toward this objective, \nsector working groups have been established at the policy, operational, and technical levels, \nincluding  technical  working  groups  for  PHC,  MNCH,  HRH,  and  health  financing  and \nmanagement. Sector reforms take place in the context of a broader review and adjustment of \npublic sector fundamentals, including the roles and responsibilities of various levels in the \nsector;  sources  and  uses  of  funds;  results-based  planning  and  budgeting;  and  financial \nmanagement with support of ADB, World Bank, and other development partners.   \n \n                                                 \n19 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

With low per capita income and high levels of poverty, public spending on health is \ncritical in the Lao PDR. However, a major challenge confronting the health sector\u2019s efforts to \nachieve the MDG targets is the low level of public financing, which is inadequate to run even \ncurrent services. Low public spending on health results in significant out-of-pocket expenses \nincurred by the population for health care in public facilities. This deters the poor from using the \nservices, with a range of consequences for individuals, households, and the public.  \n \n19.  Prior to decentralization in 2000, provincial budgets were prepared centrally, but the \nGovernment now has a highly decentralized financing system. Provincial authorities prepare \ntheir budgets based on general directions and broad budgeting norms, and then submit these to \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  for  approval. \nProvincial  budgets  are  mainly  for  operational  costs  with  small  investments  for  provincial \npriorities and counterpart funding.22 Provincial recurrent public health services costs are paid \nfrom revenues collected by the provincial authorities, and are largely absorbed by the number of \npersonnel assigned by MOH to the provinces, leaving limited funds for other recurrent costs. In \ncase provinces lack funds to achieve budget norms, MOF may allocate additional funds from \nshared or central revenues.23  \n \n20.  In 2008, the Government did not meet the target for the recurrent health budget trigger \nfor the Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations of the World Bank and other development \npartners (para. 43). The share of total recurrent budget actually decreased to 3.7% of total \nhealth spending in FY2008. Another trigger\u2014increase in staff in priority districts\u2014was actually \nachieved, but by doing so, it undermined the nonwage recurrent budgets in these provinces. \nExternal  aid  also  ties  down  domestic  funding  for  infrastructure  projects,  and  may  lead  to \nreduced domestic funding as sector allocations are based on aggregate budget. MOH and MOF \nrealize the need to contain investment spending and are requesting help to bridge the recurrent \nbudget gap. Additional sector funding is expected from Nam Theun 2 revenue. Initially, this \namount will be small, about $1 million\u2013$2 million from FY2010 onwards, but it will become \nsubstantial from 2020. In addition, this money is not earmarked for recurrent budget support.24  \n \n21.  Excluding cost recovery and aid, domestic financing of nonwage recurrent costs was \nonly $1.6 million for all public health facilities in the country. Additional nonwage expenditures\u2014\nderived from cost-recovery, extrapolating data from a study in one province\u2014are estimated at \n$1  million  or  more  countrywide.  Some  recurrent  costs  under  external  aid  are  booked  as \ninvestment. Excluding provincial hospitals and offices, the estimated nonwage annual funding \ngap to operate district health services is at least $5.3 million. For comparison, if health care for \nthe poor were to be subsidized through health equity funds at a modest level of $3 per person, \nthis would cost about $3.5 million for 17 provinces per year. If obstetric care for pregnant \nwomen were to be subsidized, it could cost $5 million per year. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n22 Although some aid also pays for recurrent costs, all aid is categorized as investment. \n23 Technically, MOF redistributes provincial revenue funds among the provinces for equity purposes. \n24 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic for the Greater Mekong Subregion Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project. Manila. \n \n ", "6     \n22.  Since the introduction of cost recovery in 1995, the out-of-pocket cost of health care has \nincreased substantially. Transport charges, fees, and indirect costs of health care\u2014especially \nfor catastrophic illnesses such as obstetric emergencies\u2014are considerable and often prohibitive \nfor the poor. An emergency caesarean section may cost several hundred dollars if transport at \nnight is required. Low affordability of services for the poor is considered the most important \ncause of low use of services. Hence, MOH is considering mandating universal health insurance \nthrough a variety of schemes, and a new health care financing strategy is being prepared. \nCognizant of the impact on MDGs, several development partners have initiated schemes to \nsubsidize health care for the poor. Although health equity funds are quick to implement and help \nbuild up provincial capacity for managing health insurance, they are not sustainable. However, \nhealth equity funds are relatively cheap, and if government revenue is increased, they should be \nable to be sustained.  \n \n23.  Limited resources are also not used efficiently, causing the Lao PDR health care system \nto be less effective. It has been input-driven, often lacking a sound public health rationale for \nallocating resources. In recent years, efforts have been made to make planning and budgeting \nmore  results-oriented  through  the  introduction  of  strategic  planning  and  budgeting,  annual \nplans, grant in aid, and better monitoring. Projects and programs in the absence of an overall \nprogram approach, however, have led to fragmentation of services. Projects and programs are \ntypically centrally funded and managed, are not well integrated or adapted to local capacity, use \ndifferent indicators and reporting and financial systems, and demand a disproportionate share of \nstaff  time.  Management  responsibilities  are  typically  segregated,  with  local  health  officers \nlacking  the  authority  to  make  adjustments  in  implementing  these  projects  and  programs \naccording to local needs and conditions. This imposes an additional burden on already stressed \nprovincial and district health systems. With MNCH, there is the additional problem of a multitude \nof pilots and packages, all with limited coverage. Hence, it is important that MOH sets national \nstandards for management and services and insists on harmonizing projects and programs. \n \n24.  The Government lacks a standard arrangement to implement policy and provide health \nsector-specific financing from the central level to the provinces. MOF and MOH are proposing \nthat, to implement the sector program approach, a fund-flow modality is created to channel \nprogram  funds  to  the  provinces  and  to  provide  financial  incentives  to  improve  sector \nperformance. The annual planning and budgeting cycle will be the core driver to implement the \nsector  program  approach.  Provincial  health  offices  are  working  to  prepare  and  use \ncomprehensive annual operation plans, showing past performance, proposed sources, and \nuses  of  funds.  These  plans  also  help  reduce  fragmentation  and  improve  provincial  aid \ncoordination. Several building blocks have been put in place with the help of development \npartners. ADB has been supporting provinces with capacity building in planning and budgeting, \nand a countrywide health management information system has also become operational. ADB \nwill  further  support  provincial  and  district  financial  management  training  under  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance.  \n \n2.  Access to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n \n25.  Improving access to health services is a difficult task in the Lao PDR, given the low \npopulation  density,  rural  living  conditions,  and  low  salaries.  Health  centers  are  placed \nstrategically  to  maximize  access  for  people  and  providers  while  containing  costs,  using  a \ngeographic information system to balance access and efficiency. However, it has not been \nfeasible  or  cost-effective  to  provide  hospitals  and  health  centers  for  small  catchment \npopulations. It is estimated that 37 districts have around 25% of their populations living more \nthan a 2-hour distance from a hospital, and in 18 districts, about 50% of the populations live \n ", "    7\nmore than 2 hours from a hospital. Moreover, the existing network is not operating as planned \ndue to serious resource constraints. It is estimated that one half of the health centers lack staff \nmembers, and most facilities face serious recurrent budget constraints. MOH, therefore, is \ngiving priority to improving existing services, their impact, and efficiency, before expanding the \nnetwork.  \n \n26.  Achieving MDGs 4 and 5 will depend on good village-level prevention and care, timely \nreferrals, and better maternal and child care at health centers and hospitals. The Government is \npromoting the concept of model healthy villages, which should help improve access to care at \nthe village level. In the model, villagers take responsibility for improving their collective health \nthrough ensuring a healthy environment, nutrition, disease prevention, timely curative care and \nreferral, and social safety net for the poor and other vulnerable groups including adolescents \nand chronic care patients. MOH has approved a decree to pilot this approach.  \n \n27.  Although MNCH services are available at most health facilities, both their quality and \nquantity show major gaps. Only 5% of type B district hospitals can perform basic emergency \nobstetric care. All provincial hospitals can provide complete services for mothers and children \non a regular basis, but performance assessments have revealed that the competency score for \nproviders ranged from 51% to 84%, with the exception of active management of the third stage \nof labor, which was only 22%. District hospitals and health centers frequently lack specialists \nand midwives to provide needed care to communities. \n \n28.  Staff salaries are in the range of $25\u2013$45 per month for civil servants at the operational \nlevel,25 insufficient to cover the living expenses of an average family. As a result, health care \nworkers often must engage in secondary occupations to augment their income. Drawing such \nworkers to rural areas is difficult due to lack of schools, social services, and higher transport \ncosts. The Government, with support of Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations, has started \nincreasing salaries about 15% in the past 2 years, but given the very low base, this is still \ninadequate to compensate staff members in rural areas. Therefore, rural staff incentives are \nbeing considered.  \n \n29.  Many  health  facilities  have  equipment  that  is  not  being  used,  yet  lack  essential \nequipment, drugs, and other supplies to perform optimally. In a survey of 12 type A district \nhospitals in the eight northern provinces, five hospitals had full sets of basic equipment, one \nhospital had a full set of medium-range equipment, and one hospital had a full set of high-range \nequipment. None had a full complement of 31 basic drugs. Similar deficiencies in equipment \nand drugs were found at type B district hospitals and health centers.26  \n \n30.  To improve MNCH services, MOH and development partners finalized the preparation of \na national strategy, identifying six challenges for achieving MDGs for maternal, infant, and child \nmortality reduction: (i) insufficient health system capacity, (ii) fragmented responsibilities, (iii) \nlack  of  investment  and  high  out-of-pocket  expenses,  (iv)  limited  availability  and  quality  of \nservices, (v) low access and use of services, and (vi) human resources constraints.  \n \n31.  MOH,  with  help  of  United  Nations  agencies  and  other  development  partners,  is \npreparing standards for MNCH targets, interventions, and resources at various levels. The plan \nis that MNCH-friendly health facilities are rolled out across the country, presuming a strong buy-\n                                                 \n25 MOF, Government of the Lao PDR. 2004.

This is not without \nchallenges, due to lack of staff members and posting qualified staff members to remote areas. \nIn addition, ethnic groups are often reluctant to use services if staff members cannot speak their \nlanguage. Training students from various ethnic groups to become PHC workers has proved \nparticularly successful in bridging this social gap, and their skills will also need to be upgraded. \nIt also requires staff incentives and more operational expenses for supplies and maintenance. \nAchieving MNCH targets will require substantial recurrent budget support. \n \n32.  MOH is also considering making delivery care free to overcome the financial obstacles \nof institutional obstetric care. The total cost of all routine and complicated obstetric care amount \nto about $5 million per year. One option\u2014but only targeting the poor\u2014is health equity funds, \nwhich provide an existing mechanism for paying for maternal and child care for the poor, \nincluding transport costs. These funds are being piloted at the village level, whereby village \nhealth committees have funds for basic care and referral of the poor. Further improvement on \nthe demand for health services, including for MNCH, is expected from model health villages. \n \n  3.  Human Resources for Health \n \n33.  As  access  and  acceptability  of  services  improve,  the  quality  of  care  is  gaining \nprominence as a determinant of suboptimum health service utilization. MOH has shifted its \nhuman resources focus from increasing the quantity to improving the quality of its staff.  \n \n34.  Based on an in-depth HRH situation analysis in 2006, MOH indicated a need for a \nsystematic  approach  to  training,  deploying,  and  incentivizing  the  health  workforce. \nSubsequently, with support from a technical working group and ADB, MOH analyzed the health \nworkforce and prepared a draft national HRH plan, which proposed upgrading the workforce. As \npart of the plan, MOH will endorse a skilled birth attendance development plan in all district \nhospitals, and train a minimum of one person per health center in basic emergency obstetric \ncare.  The  plan  will  also  set  standards  for  staff  performance,  remuneration,  education  and \ntraining, professional competence, and certification and licensing. The plan is being reviewed by \nstakeholders in MOH, other government agencies, and development partners. Its promulgation \nis expected by in 2010. \n \n35.  To achieve MDG 5, maternal mortality reduction, the number of staff members who can \nprovide skilled birth attendance must increase. Indeed, providing obstetric care at all health care \nfacilities is an important component of the national MNCH strategy. As part of the national HRH \nplan, MOH recently drafted a skilled birth attendance development plan to create a skilled \nworkforce to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. It aims to train existing staff \nmembers in skilled birth attendance, and new entrants in registered midwifery and community \nmidwifery. With this, MOH plans to provide comprehensive emergency obstetric care in all \nprovincial and type A district hospitals as well as basic emergency obstetric care in all type B \ndistrict  hospitals  and health  centers.  In  addition,  MOH  intends  to  train  a  minimum  of  one  \nhigh-level PHC worker per health center, and where needed, an ethnic group member, in basic \nemergency  obstetric  care.  MOH  lacks  funding,  however,  to  implement  the  skilled  birth \nattendance plan.  \n \n36.  A number of studies have been conducted that found inadequate knowledge and skills of \nMNCH service providers for the provision of accurate information and appropriate services to \nclients,  despite  their  participation  in  several  in-service  trainings.  A  survey  among  health \npersonnel working in Oudomxay and Xieng Khouang provinces revealed that many health care \nworkers were unable to diagnose and treat common diseases. The core problem is thought to \n ", "    9\nbe substandard pre-service training, as staff quality is affected by the substandard level of \nteaching institutions at both the central and provincial levels. Education of the health care \nworkforce is undertaken in three types of institutions. Pre-service training for high-level staff \nmembers takes place at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane. The College of Health \nTechnology  in  Vientiane  provides  pre-service  training  for  mid-level  technical  nurses  and  \npost-basic bachelor\u2019s degrees for nurses. The Luang Prabang School provides pre-service \ntraining for high-level PHC workers. Mid-level technical nurses and PHC workers are trained in \nregional public health schools located throughout the country. There is no domestic pre-service \nor post-graduate training of midwives at present.  \n \n37.  Excessive  intake  of  fee-paying  students,  lack  of  qualified  lecturers,  and  poor  skills \ntraining are some of the basic problems that affect these institutions. The number of fee-paying \nstudents is based largely on demand and the institutions\u2019 desire to generate income, with limited \nconsideration given to institutions\u2019 capacity. By 2008, medical sciences faculty had an intake of \n393 students, compared with intakes between 100 and 125 students annually from 2001 to \n2004. The College of Health Technology reported that 80% of enrolled students in technical \nnurse  training  were  fee-paying  in  2005;  in  technical  nurse  schools  in  Champasak,  Luang \nPrabang, and Savannakhet, fee-paying students exceed 60% of total enrolled students. While \nthis trend has increased revenue, it has had a negative impact on quality of training. Poor \nstudents  unable  to  afford  fees  are  discriminated  against  by  price.  Without  a  system  for \ncontinuing accreditation of these institutions, the quality of the training has sharply deteriorated.  \n \n38.  The quality of education and training at these institutions was questioned even before \nthe added burden of overcrowding. These institutions lack qualified teachers, skills-focused and \nparticipatory teaching methods, and proper facilities and equipment such as laboratories and \ncomputers. Other problems are the low level of basic science and math knowledge in high \nschool graduates, lack of opportunity for hospital and community practice, and lack of adequate \nplanning and supervision. In general, these institutions do not have a strategic approach nor \nplan toward improving the quality of education. \n \nC.  External Assistance \n \n  1.  Donor Coordination \n \n39.  Following  the  Vientiane  Declaration,  MOH  has  moved  toward  a  sector  program \napproach. The Government of Japan and WHO, with the help of JICA, are assisting MOH in \nsector-wide  coordination.  MOH  and  development  partners  have  agreed  on  a  coordination \nframework that is currently being implemented, and a national health sector program has been \nprepared based on priorities under the 7th Health Sector Development Plan. Sector working \ngroups have been established at policy, operational, and technical levels. ADB is playing a \nleading role in the HRH working group and participates in working groups for health financing \nand MNCH. A summary of external assistance and coordination is in Appendix 3.  \n \n40.  Under the Minister of Health\u2019s strong leadership, there is good alignment of development \npartner investment. ADB, Lux-Development S. A., and World Bank are supporting provincial \nhealth services and health financing with similar interventions in, respectively, the northern, \nmiddle, and southern provinces. United Nations agencies mainly provide technical support. \nADB; Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement; Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria; and World Bank provide complementary support for communicable disease control. \nADB, JICA, WHO, and World Bank also support HRH. The People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nand the Republic of Korea support hospital services.   \n ", "10     \n41.  However, the Lao PDR\u2019s health sector has lacked domestic funding, and is increasingly \nfacing a paucity of external funding as several bilaterals have moved out. It is increasingly \ndependent on a few partners, including the Global Fund and Lux-Development. In the next 10 \nyears, the sector will continue to depend on substantial external support. Further, Nam Theun 2 \nrevenues will only become more significant after 2018.      \n \n42.  The World Bank and development partners27 are currently providing support for public \nexpenditure reforms. Public sector fundamentals are being improved, such as through the 2006 \nBudget Law and ADB support for the medium-term expenditure framework.28 The Ministry of \nEducation and other ministries have pioneered the sector program approach with considerable \nuncertainty, but now stand committed to developing this approach further. It is now seen as a \nmore strategic and transparent approach with expected impact and efficiency gains.  \n \n43.  Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations is a budget support mechanism for poverty \nreduction. Its framework includes a European Commission variable tranche of \u20ac1 million based \non two triggers: (i) recurrent health budget as a percent of total budget, with the share at least \nequal to the baseline (3.9% in FY2007); and (ii) the number of health personnel in 47 priority \ndistricts at least equal to the baseline (1,644 in 2007). As stated previously, the first trigger was \nnot achieved, as the share of total recurrent budget decreased to 3.7% in FY2008. The second \nindicator was achieved with an increase to 1,724 staff members in these districts. MOH noted \nthat while Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations puts an additional financial burden on MOH, \neven if triggers were met, there is no assurance that funds would actually flow into the sector or \nbe used for recurrent budget. \n \n44.  Additional funding to the health sector is expected from Nam Theun 2 revenue from \nFY2010 onwards. The amount and use of these funds are unknown, but the amount will be \ndistributed across five sectors and will be small until FY2020.29 Estimated revenues to the \nGovernment will rise gradually (while commercial debt service is paid) from about $7.2 million in \nthe first year (FY2010), to an average of about $10 million per year in the first 5 years (FY2014), \nto an average of about $15 million from FY2015 to FY2019, and increasing sharply thereafter to \nan average of about $40 million from FY2020 to FY2024. The health sector is expected to \nreceive about an average of $2 million per year during the first 5-year period, FY2010\u2013FY2014. \nWhile revenues may help increase domestic financing in the health sector in the near to medium \nterm, MOH has not decided for what these funds will be used. These funds may be targeted to \nspecific, centrally funded priority programs like immunization and model healthy villages rather \nthan recurrent budget support.  \n \n  2.  Lessons from ADB Experience \n \n45.  ADB has been successfully supporting the Lao PDR\u2019s health sector in three areas: (i) \nPHC in the eight northern provinces, (ii) MOH and provincial capacity building countrywide, and \n(iii) communicable disease control. ADB's Primary Health Care Expansion Project has just been \nclosed, and its performance was satisfactory. It helped improve access to quality PHC in the \neight  northern  provinces,  and  build  institutional  capacity  countrywide.  It  had  demonstrable \n                                                 \n27  World Bank. 2007. Lao PDR Third Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations (PRSO-3). Washington, DC.  \n28 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for Strengthening Public Financial Management. Manila \n29  Revenue from Nam Theun 2 is expected to be available to the Government in FY2009\u2013FY2010, including (i) \ngovernment contributions under article 19.1 of the Concession Agreement, (ii) water resources user charges, and \n(iii) Nam Theun Power Corporation dividends and taxes. The initial target sectors for the first round of revenue \ninclude (i) health, (ii) basic education, (iii) rural roads, (iv) environment, and (v) the poverty reduction fund. \nRevenue is to be used for specific sector programs and projects, but may include recurrent budget support.   \n ", "    11\nimpact on the use of health services, such as doubling the number of institutional deliveries. In \ntotal, almost 100 health facilities were constructed or upgraded. It also successfully trained \nethnic group members as PHC workers and VHVs, and expanded drug revolving funds. While \nproject  implementation  was  relatively  smooth,  project  evaluation  identified  several  lessons \nlinked to the low use and underfunding of health facilities, including staff quality, low pay, \ninadequate maintenance of equipment, and inadequate outreach and support of VHVs, which to \na  large  extent  are  driven  by  constraints  addressed  in  this  HSDP,  including  low  recurrent \nspending and substandard quality of pre-service education.  \n \n46.  ADB's Health System Development Project approved in 2007 for 4 years is currently \nsupporting MOH in improving sector performance in eight northern provinces and institutional \ncapacity  building  countrywide.30 This  includes  the  preparation  of  the  7th  Health  Sector \nDevelopment  Plan  and  national  HRH  plan,  strengthening  provincial  health  planning  and \nbudgeting, management training, and piloting health equity funds and a results-based approach. \nProject implementation is mainstreamed through the relevant MOH and provincial departments, \nthereby helping build their capacities. From the end of 2009, ADB will also provide capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance to help develop detailed financial arrangements for the sector \nprogram approach and to strengthen provincial and district financial management.31  \n \n  3.  Sector Program Approach \n \n47.  In line with the Vientiane Declaration, MOH wants to implement the 7th Health Sector \nDevelopment Plan through a sector program approach. MOH has asked ADB to help develop \nthe approach in the health sector with its development partners. In view of provincial and district \ncapacity constraints, a sector development program modality for the first program assistance in \nthe  Lao  PDR's  health  sector  is  considered  most  appropriate.  The  modality  supports  a \ncombination of policy reforms and recurrent budget support with accompanying investments and \ncapacity building to help implement the reforms. Drawing on lessons identified in the education \nsector, MOF and MOH are proposing a fund-flow modality that ensures that program funds are \nused in the health sector.    \n \n48.  Such an approach is considered in line with Strategy 2020 and the Operational Plan for \nHealth.32 The operational plan envisages a direct role in program-based support for health that \naddress governance and public expenditure management for cost-effective delivery of health \nprograms  and  services,  based  on  developing  member  country  demand  and  the  individual \ncountry partnership strategy process. Partners, especially Lux-Development and World Bank, \nindicated their support for the approach and interest in future program funding. The Lao PDR\u2019s \nhealth  sector  makes  a  good  case  for  assistance  given  (i)  high  poverty  levels  and  MDG \nchallenges,  (ii)  strong  leadership  from  the  Government  for  sector  reforms  and  aid \nharmonization, and (iii) a current paucity of domestic and external funding. ADB will support a \ntransition to new aid architecture in the Lao PDR's health sector to improve sector performance \nand to ensure that past investments are sustained. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2007.

The impact of the HSDP will be reduced maternal and child mortality and malnutrition by \n2015. The outcome will be improved use of PHC, particularly for women, children, and ethnic \ngroups. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.   Special Features \n \n50.  Following the Vientiane Declaration in 2006, MOH, with support of WHO, JICA, and \nother partners, have agreed to a sector-wide coordination framework. MOH is committed to \nimplement part of the 7th Health Sector Development Plan through a sector program approach. \nThe HSDP is the first program assistance for the Lao PDR's health sector. It will focus on planning \nand financing, MNCH, and HRH development as a cohesive set of policy actions to address key \nconstraints in access to and use of health care, particularly for poor women, children, and ethnic \ngroups. Although the HSDP is national in scope to help create a countrywide platform for \nsupport, there is considerable variation in provincial financing, and the level of support under the \nHSDP will depend on annual assessment of performance and financing gaps. \n \n51.  Public sector financing prospects for the Lao PDR are good in the long term. Around \n2020, domestic revenues\u2014including from Nam Theun 2\u2014will be substantial. However, in the \nmedium term, the sector remains financially dependent on external funding. The HSDP presents \nbridge funding for this interim period. As implementation of policy reforms is partly shouldered \nby the provinces, MOF has agreed that external program funds will be passed on to the \nprovinces as support for recurrent cost financing. The HSDP will support a fund-flow mechanism \nto provide supplementary recurrent budget support to the provinces, districts, and villages. \n \nC.   Program Outputs \n \n52.  The program outputs are (i) strengthened planning and financing, (ii) increased access \nto MNCH care, and (iii) improved quality of HRH. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n1.  Output 1: Strengthened Planning and Financing \n \n53.  MOH is developing the 7th Health Sector Development Plan as input to the 7th National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan. MOH\u2019s plan is results-based, being created and budgeted \nfrom the district level, and aggregated for each province to form provincial health development \nplans. Annual operation plans will be developed for each province for each year in the planning \nperiod, will estimate the recurrent and capital costs required each year, and will provide the \nbasis for securing program assistance for recurrent expenditures.  \n \n54.  Provinces  will  be  largely  responsible  for  financing  the  downstream  costs  of  policy \nactions. The program proceeds will be used to provide supplementary budget support for the \nprovincial authorities, essentially helping the provinces to at least double nonwage recurrent \nspending. This will be done through results-based supplementary block grants for recurrent \nexpenditures including, within certain budget norms, operational expenses, staff incentives, field \nallowances, maintenance and repairs, quality improvement measures, monitoring and reporting, \nand  funding  for  health  equity  funds.  These  health  equity  funds  make  health  care  more \naffordable to the poor, and are a means to build up capacity for universal health insurance \n ", "    13\ncoverage. It is anticipated that other development partners will also use the program financing \nmodality. The budget support is considered a temporary measure until government revenues\u2014\neither central or provincial\u2014increase. \n \n55.  The first policy action for the first tranche release is that MOF shall have approved the \nprogram funding mechanism for supplementary program support for the provincial health sector \nand copy of such Memorandum of Understanding shall have been provided to ADB. It is \nanticipated that development partners will use this mechanism to increase funding for recurrent \nexpenditures. Recurrent budget support will, within certain budget norms, be needs-based for \noperation and maintenance, staff incentives, and health equity funds for the poor. MOF has \nagreed to use the entire program funds of $10 million for non-salary recurrent budget support to \nthe provinces. The second policy action is that MOH approves the national health information \nsystem strategic plan, 2009\u20132015.33 The third policy action is that MOF shall have provided a \ncommitment to ADB to increase the domestic nonwage recurrent budget for health by at least \n10% annually from FY2010 to FY2014 (Appendix 4). While as a proportion this increase may \nappear high, the Government's recurrent health spending is still very low at less than $2 million \nper year, and the gap can be entirely financed from program proceeds. It is also expected that \nafter this period, other sources of funding will come on line. \n \n56.  The first policy action for the second tranche release is that provincial authorities shall \nhave approved the results-based annual operation plans and budgets and copies thereof shall \nhave been provided to ADB. The second policy action is that MOH issues a decision approving \nstandards, guidelines, and terms of reference for district hospitals, and copies provided to ADB. \nWithout such guidelines, it is difficult to budget MNCH requirements for these facilities. The third \npolicy action is that MOF submits a letter to ADB confirming the increased domestic non-wage \nrecurrent spending by at least 10% compared to FY2010 level. At this time, it is expected that \nthe 7th National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011\u20132015) will have been approved, as \nwell as the health financing strategy, which are expected to mobilize additional program funding. \n \n2.   Output 2: Increased Access to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n \n57.  In May 2009, MOH approved the national MNCH strategy, the first policy action for the \nfirst  tranche  release.  It  describes  health  system  strengthening,  and  mobilizing  individuals, \nfamilies, and communities to achieve rapid and equitable scale-up for delivery of essential,  \ncost-effective, evidence-based interventions to improve MNCH in selected districts, monitor \nMNCH care, and ensure that district health plans adequately address MNCH care. The national \nMNCH strategy is initially costed at $6.2 million. As the first policy action for the second tranche \nrelease, MOH issues a decision approving the rollout of the MNCH friendly health facilities, \nproviding a minimum package of MNCH services and a copy thereof provided to ADB. The \nexpansion of coverage of these qualified facilities will be a good indicator for access to quality \nobstetric care. A major issue is the cost of obstetric care, and MOH is considering various \noptions to provide subsidized delivery care through a health equity fund or otherwise.  \n \n58.  Model healthy villages have emerged from the midterm review of the 6th Health Sector \nDevelopment Plan as an important priority for achieving MDGs. A healthy model village is \ndefined as one that maintains basic conditions needed to lead a healthy life, emphasizing \nMNCH, including nutrition. With support of a $3 million Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant, \nMOH  will  field  test  a  comprehensive  model  that  has  four  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  village \n                                                 \n33 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. National Health Information System Strategic Plan, 2009\u20132015. Vientiane.  \n ", "14     \ncapacity for participatory planning and management of model healthy villages, (ii) improved \nvillage infrastructure for PHC delivery, (iii) strengthened capacity of districts and health centers \nto support model healthy villages, and (iv) project management and implementation support. A \nsecond policy action of the first tranche release is Decree No. 381, approved in June 2009, \nestablishing the directives for piloting at least two model healthy villages per district in each of \nthe participating provinces (about 300 in total) together with a copy of the supplementary \nguidelines on piloting model healthy villages. Using experiences from this pilot, a second policy \naction of the second tranche release is that MOH issues a decision approving the standard \nguidelines and strategic plan for the scale up and rollout of model healthy villages in at least 300 \nremote villages in the participating provinces by the end of 2015.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Improved Quality of Human Resources for Health \n \n59.  MOH, through the Department of Organization and Personnel and the HRH technical \nworking group, prepared a draft national HRH policy in 2009 with support from ADB's Health \nSystem Development Project (footnote 30). Approval is expected in December 2009. The plan \nsets  targets  for  workforce  size,  mix,  and  distribution;  staff  performance,  remuneration, \neducation, and training; professional competence; and certification and licensing. The plan is \ncurrently being costed and includes the skilled birth attendance plan of $3.5 million to improve \nskills in maternal and newborn health care. The national HRH policy is to be issued by a Prime \nMinister\u2019s decree in January 2010. The policy action for the first tranche release is that MOH \napproves the national implementation plan for skilled birth attendance plan. The policy action for \nthe second tranche release is that MOH submits to ADB a copy of the National Policy on \nHuman Resources for Health approved by the Prime Minister. The plan, once approved, will \ncommit the central and provincial authorities to finance downstream costs of staff upgrading and \nwages.   \n \nD.  Project Outputs \n \n60.  The project outputs are coordinated with program outputs: (i) strengthened planning and \nfinancing capacity, (ii) increased access to MNCH care, and (iii) improved quality of HRH. \n \n1.  Output 1: Strengthened Planning and Financing \n \n61.  Under  the  guidance  of  the  provincial  committees  for  health,  a  bottom-up  planning \nprocess will be supported. Provincial health management teams will conduct strategic planning \nexercises to improve their 5-year plans and prepare medium-term expenditure frameworks to \nsupport basic public health functions. Based on these 5-year plans, district and provinces will be \nassisted  in  preparing  and  implementing  results-based  annual  operation  plans,  including \nbudgets. The Project will support the adaptation of guidelines, standards, and procedures for \nstrategic  planning,  budgeting,  and  management.  It  will  also  help  establish  the  fund-flow \nmechanism for program-financed block grants. It will set up a temporary financial control unit in \nMOH to support the provinces and MOF in the management of block grants to mitigate delays in \nthe release of funds, and conduct periodic inspections of the use of program funds. \n \n62.  MOH  has  established  clear  terms  of  reference  and  guidelines  for  health  centers. \nHowever,  similar  guidelines  have  not  been  established  for  district  hospitals.  Without  such \nguidelines, it is difficult to budget MNCH requirements for these facilities. The Project will \nsupport MOH to prepare guidelines and terms of reference for district health offices and district \nhospitals. These will contain standards for organizational structure, personnel, management \nresponsibilities, performance criteria, facilities, and equipment and drugs for district hospitals. \n ", "    15\n \n63.  Under the overall umbrella of the national health financing policy, the Project will support \nthe expansion of health equity funds based on lessons learned from ongoing pilot projects of \nADB and development partners. The recurrent budget support can also be used to operate \nthese funds. It is expected that, in addition to the three provinces under the current Health \nSystems Development Project (footnote 30), an additional three to five provinces will establish \nhealth equity funds, preferably to cover the entire province but otherwise the poorest districts. \nExpansion will be based on a firm commitment of the province to sustain the scheme from its \nown  resources.  The  major  challenges  for  scaling  up  health  equity  funds  are  (i)  financial \nconstraints, (ii) making pilots fully functional and sustainable at the provincial level, and (iii) \ndeveloping standard health equity fund guidelines. The Project will support alignment with other \nhealth  equity  fund  schemes,  preparation  of  guidelines,  provincial  advocacy  and  capacity \nbuilding, contracting, and training. This will include building MOH and provincial capacity in \nhealth equity fund management, preparation of a strategic plan, and preparation of national \nguidelines for their implementation. The Project will support the training of health equity fund \nmanagement committees, staff training, field support, fund management oversight by a third-\nparty managing agency, and technical support required for health equity fund implementation.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Increased Access to Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care \n \n64.  The  Project  will  help  provinces  implement  the  national  MNCH  strategy  through  a  \ndistrict-wide rollout of mother- and child-friendly health facilities in northern provinces. Priority \nwill be given to districts with high maternal mortality rates. MOH, with the help of development \npartners,  has  developed  minimum  standards  for  MNCH  services  and  has  drafted  an \nimplementation plan for district-wide advocacy, planning, upgrading, and recognition of mother- \nand child-friendly health facilities. The Project will help conduct health services surveys for \nimplementing  the  national  MNCH  strategy  in  northern  provinces  to  provide  a  baseline  of \nresources, services, and outputs. Funding will be provided for the use and provision of essential \nequipment at all levels based on need. The survey results will also assist provinces in seeking \nresults-based supplementary budget support for MNCH services under the program assistance.  \n \n65.  Civil works are concentrated in the northern provinces, as Lux-Development and World \nBank  are  expected  to  provide  similar  support  in,  respectively,  the  central  and  southern \nprovinces. The Project will support upgrading of Boun Neua District Hospital from type B to type \nA in Phongsali Province, upgrading Nam Bak District Hospital (type A) and renovating Vien \nKham District Hospital (type B) in Luang Prabang Province, and renovating Mok Mai District \nHospital (type B) in Xieng Khouang Province. It will also support replacing a total of 10 health \ncenters and renovating a total of 10 health centers in Luang Prabang, Oudomxai, and Xieng \nKhouang  provinces.  All  civil  works  will  address  waste  management  issues  including  staff \ntraining. The Project will also support countrywide assessment, advocacy, training, and piloting \nfor the implementation of the national integrated health care waste management plan.34  \n \n66.  The Project will also support MOH to achieve its target of piloting model healthy villages \nin at least two villages per district in all provinces (a total of 282 villages) in the first 2 years, and \nfurther roll out the approach with at least proportional representation of small and isolated ethnic \ngroup villages. The experiences of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction pilot will be used to \nprepare standard guidelines and strategic plan for expansion. The Project will finance capacity \nbuilding of provincial and district health offices to organize, implement, supervise, and monitor \nmodel healthy villages, while program funds will be used to finance investment in the villages.    \n                                                 \n34 MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2008.

The Project will support skilled birth attendant training and related training capacity \ninputs for up to $1 million, and MOH has already trained trainers in the five public health \nschools. However, additional regional training may be required. The United Nations Population \nFund will monitor the institutional capacity for midwifery training including facilities, skills, and \nequipment,  and  indicate  additional  funding  requirements.  According  to  the  skilled  birth \nattendance  plan,  the  Project  will  support  training  of  about  500  staff  members,  including \nobstetricians, medical officers, midwives, nurses, medical assistants, and PHC workers. The \nProject will support about one third of the projected in-services training in the plan up to 2012. \nImproving  skills  training  will  require  the  recruitment  of  regional  or  overseas  teachers.  The \nProject will use information from its health services survey to fill gaps in essential MNCH skills \nand equipment.  \n \n68.  The  Project  will  also  begin  to  address  weaknesses  in  the  pre-service  training  and \neducation of health personnel who enter the health workforce. Sustainable improvement of HRH \nwill  require  institutional  strengthening  for  educational  institutions.  MOH  has  requested \nassistance to develop master plans for the University of Health Sciences and College of Health \nTechnology. This output will also provide teaching equipment and help upgrade teachers\u2019 skills. \n \nE.  Investment Plan \n \n  1.  Program Investment \n \n69.  The Government has requested that ADB support the Government's policy actions under \nthe HSDP by providing a program grant of $10 million from its Special Funds resources to be \nreleased in two tranches ($5 million each), with the first tranche to be released upon grant \neffectiveness, and a second tranche within 24 months post-effectiveness. The size of the grant \nis based on the medium-term costs of the proposed policy actions with an estimated adjustment \ncost of about $15 million. The Government has agreed to pass on the equivalent of the $10 \nmillion program grant to the provinces as supplementary nonsalary recurrent budget support for \nthe  health  sector  for  operation  and  maintenance;  quality  improvement;  outreach  and \nsupervision; and rolling out mother- and child-friendly services, health equity funds, and model \nhealthy villages. \n \n70.  The two-tranche design ensures follow-up support for policy actions that trigger the first \ntranche. In determining the amount of the grant, the following factors were considered: (i) the \nscope and strength of proposed policy actions, (ii) minimum cost of a package of basic services \nfor the poor, (iii) short- and medium-term costs of proposed policy actions, (iv) fiscal constraints \nand associated financing gaps, (v) absorptive capacity of the provinces, and (vi) good prospects \nfor sustaining increased domestic health sector financing in the long term. The Government has \nalso noted that additional funding is expected from other development partners, which would \nallow further rollout of its priority programs for mother- and child-friendly services, health equity \nfunds, and model healthy villages. \n  \n  2.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  HSDP Management \n \n73.  MOH, through the Department of Planning and Finance (DPF), will be the Executing \nAgency (EA) for the HSDP, responsible for overall implementation and coordination. An MOH \nsteering  committee,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Health  and  comprising  vice  ministers  and \n ", "18     \nrepresentatives of MOH departments, will provide overall guidance in HSDP implementation. \nThe MOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and other ministries will be invited to the \nsteering committee, as required.   \n \n74.  Within DPF, a project coordination unit will be established, with the DPF deputy director \ngeneral as director. The unit will include three deputy directors, two administrative officers, and \none private firm for accounting services. It will be responsible for (i) program coordination, (ii) \ntimely submission of policy measures, (iii) preparing and managing the project annual plan and \nbudget, (iv) providing guidance to national and provincial implementing agencies, (v) monitoring \nsocial and environmental safeguards, (vi) ensuring that ADB requirements are being complied \nwith, (vii) monitoring and evaluation, (viii) submitting quarterly progress and financial reports to \nADB, (ix) conducting reviews and surveys, (x) major civil works and procurement of goods and \nservices, (xi) hiring consulting services, and (xii) administrative and financial management.  \n \n75.  Within  MOH,  program  implementation  will  be  delegated  to  concerned  departments \nacting as national implementing agencies, including the departments of Curative, Food and \nDrugs, and Organization and Personnel, and the MNCH Hospital. These departments will be \nresponsible for planning, implementing, and reviewing delegated project activities within their \nresponsibilities. Provincial health offices will act as implementing agencies, through the PHC \ncoordination units and will be responsible for (i) supporting the preparation of annual operation \nplans; (ii) facilitating the processing and implementation of conditional grants; (iii) implementing \nprovincial HSDP activities, and ensuring the quality of these activities, including training and \nminor civil works procurement; and (iv) financial management of the HSDP.  \n \n76.  As per the gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10), gender and ethnic group \nopportunities  and  concerns  will  be  central  to  project  implementation.  Plans,  training,  and \nservices  will  address  the  special needs  of  women  and  ethnic  groups,  and  reports  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender and ethnic group. An MOH gender committee will provide oversight to \nensure implementation of the gender and ethnic group action plan. MOH will also appoint a \ngender and ethnic group focal point. International and national consultants (i.e., gender and \ncommunity development experts) will support the EA. A gender specialist in the ADB Lao \nResident Mission will provide backstopping and also help monitor the implementation of the \nplan. Representatives from the Lao Women\u2019s Union and Lao Front for National Construction will \nfacilitate  participation  by  women  and  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities  and  participate  in \nsteering committee meetings. Quarterly progress reports will provide updates on the effect of \noutputs on women and ethnic groups. The midterm review mission will consider past updates \nand make adjustments as necessary.  \n \n77.  Implementation period. The program period is from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2012. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013, and \nthe grant will close by 30 June 2014. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n78.  Project procurement. All ADB-financed procurement will be done in accordance to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan \nwith indicative contract packages is in Appendix 8. Works, goods, and services $100,000 and \nabove will be procured through national competitive bidding. Minor works, goods, and services \ncosting less than $100,000 may be procured through shopping. Vehicles may be procured \nthrough the United Nations Office for Project Services, as its procurement procedures are \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n \n ", "    19\n \n79.  Consulting services. The Project will require five international consultants for a total of \n39 person-months, six national consultants for a total of 71 person-months, and two national \nfirms for accounting and architecture. The international experts in program management (20 \nperson-months), MNCH (3 person-months), medical education development (7 person-months), \ngender (6 person-months), and health equity fund (3 person-months) will be hired as individual \nconsultants, with advance action for engaging the planning and financing expert. Accounting \nand architecture firms will be hired using biodata technical proposal and consultant qualification \nselection. Other national consultants will be hired as individual consultants. All consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).   \n  \n80.  Advance contracting. MOH will take advance action to ensure project readiness and \ntimely implementation. It will (i) finalize the project administration manual, and identify and \napprove key project staff members before grant negotiation; (ii) finalize and approve the terms \nof  reference  of  the  international  planning  and  financing  expert,  as  well  as  the  fund-flow \nmechanism for program funds; and (iii) initiate the bidding process for goods and civil works. \nContract with a firm will only be signed after the grant financing agreement is effective. Advance \naction for contracting does not commit ADB to approve this Project or to finance recruitment \ncosts.  \n  \n81.  Program  disbursement.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  released  at  grant \neffectiveness upon compliance of all the first tranche policy actions, and the second tranche of \n$5 million will be released after 24 months upon compliance with the second tranche policy \nactions (Appendix 4). The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included on a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  (Appendix  5).  The \nGovernment  will  certify  if  the  value  of  the  Lao  PDR's  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is at least equal to the amount of the grant to be disbursed in a given period. ADB \nwill have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment's certification. MOF will provide an equivalent amount to the first and second \ntranche, respectively, in a special MOF program account for recurrent budget support to the \nprovinces during the next 2 fiscal years. The first set of policy actions is expected to be fulfilled \nby October 2009, and the first tranche release is scheduled for December 2009. The second \ntranche is scheduled for release by June 2012. All policy actions will be verified by official \ndocumentation provided by MOF and MOH. \n \n82.  Project disbursement. Project grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each fiscal year, \nDPF will ensure that each participating department and province prepares annual reports, plans, \nand budgets, and has these approved by the MOH steering committee before any funds are \nreleased. MOH and MOF will ensure the timely release of funds.  \n \n83.  MOF will open an imprest account for the Project at the Bank of Lao PDR. ADB will \ndeposit into the account an estimated 6 months of expenditure or 10% of the project grant \namount, whichever is less. DPF will open a second-generation imprest account to manage \nproject funds for MOH at any bank acceptable to MOH and ADB, and MOF will deposit an \nestimated 6 months\u2019 expenditure or 5% of the project grant amount, whichever is less, in this \naccount. The statement of expenditure procedure may be used in obtaining reimbursement for \neligible expenditures and in liquidating advances from the imprest account or replenishing the \n ", "20     \naccount. This procedure applies to contracts of not more than $100,000 equivalent per payment \nand to the liquidation of advances made from the imprest account according to the financial \ncovenants of the grant. Detailed arrangements for establishing the imprest account and the \nstate of expenditure procedure will conform to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Adequate \nsupporting documentation, as defined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept at \neach level of project management to substantiate all expenditures made with the grant proceeds. \n \n84.  Project accounting, auditing, and reporting. The EA will hire an accounting firm for \nfinancial management according to the terms of reference in Appendix 8. MOH and provincial \nhealth offices will keep separate records and accounts for the Project, identifying the goods and \nservices financed with the grant proceeds. The EA has implemented similar projects financed by \nADB and others in the last 10 years. Past experience and the results of the assessment indicate \nsatisfactory financial management capacity on the part of the EA. \n \n85.  The State Audit Organization or any other certified auditor acceptable to ADB will audit \neach year all accounts and financial statements, statements of expenditure and revenues, and \nactivities  in  the  imprest  account  related  to  the  Project,  according  to  auditing  standards \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, including the auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of grant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and use of the imprest \naccount under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedure will be submitted not later than 9 \nmonths after the financial year due to the difficulty of arranging audit in scattered field sites. A \nseparate audit opinion will be issued on the use of the imprest account and statement of \nexpenditure procedure. \n \n86.  The EA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within \n30 days of the end of each quarter. The progress reports will be in English and in a format \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other things, progress made against established \ntargets, problems encountered during the previous quarter, steps taken to resolve problems, \ncompliance with grant covenants, and the proposed program of activities for the succeeding \nquarter. Within 3 months after the physical completion of the Project, MOH will submit to ADB a \nproject completion report with details of program implementation, accomplishments, outstanding \nissues, and proposed remedial actions.  \n \n87.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and EA. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n88.  MOH has handled five ADB projects through the same administrative unit, which is now \nfamiliar with ADB procedures and anticorruption measures. The previous projects helped set \nclear procedures for the procurement of equipment and civil works, with financial management \nsupport from a private accounting firm. There have not been any major audit issues or instances \nof  suspected  fraud.  MOH  will  ensure  that  (i)  staff  members  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy receive orientation; (ii) notice boards at the provincial health offices display \ninformation on contracts, list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details \n ", "    21\non bidding procedures, contract award, and list of goods and services procured; and (iii) an \nMOH  steering  committee  comprising  representatives  from  ADB,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Justice, \nMinistry of Planning and Investment acts as the grievance redress body to (a) receive and \nresolve complaints and grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders on misuse of funds \nand other irregularities; (b) review and address grievances of stakeholders in relation to either \nthe Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect \nof the Project; and (c) proactively and constructively respond to them. \n \n89.  Involuntary resettlement. The four hospitals and 20 health centers will be upgraded, \nrenovated, or replaced on existing government land free of encumbrances. No resettlement \nissues have been identified or are expected. However, these assessments will be confirmed \nduring project implementation of civil works. If any land acquisition or other action is required \nthat  affects  private  persons  and/or  users  of  the  land,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nto guide the preparation of a land acquisition and resettlement plan (Appendix 11). In case of \nany change in scope, the new site will also be inspected for any possible resettlement issues.  \n \n90.  Environment.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  through  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment.  The  Project  will  support  the  upgrading  of  four  hospitals  and \nupgrading or replacement of 20 health centers based on MOH guidelines for the construction of \nhealth facilities developed under the Primary Health Care Expansion Project (footnote 26). No \nsignificant adverse impacts were identified; the investment will have a positive impact on the \nenvironment. The main concern is medical waste management. Most health facilities separate \nwaste, but the subsequent handling is inadequate. The Project will not cause any significant \npollution,  health  hazards,  or  soil  erosion.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination,  in \nAppendix  12,  examined  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  and  identifies \nmitigation measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts and maximizes beneficial impacts. \nEnvironmental  implications  of  proposed  policy  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  no  negative \nenvironmental impacts are anticipated. Environmental impacts of the investment component \nwere reviewed, and monitoring and mitigation measures were incorporated into the project \ndesign.  Environmentally  sound  medical  waste  treatment  will  be  included  in  the  design  of \nupgraded health facilities. Site selection, design, construction, replacement work, and facility \noperation will conform to relevant regulations and standards of the Government, international \ngood practices, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n \n91.  MOH is planning to roll out a plan to improve waste management in health facilities, and \nthe major challenge will be compliance with these guidelines, in terms of proper disposal of such \nwaste. The Project will support the Environment Health Division, Department of Hygiene and \nPrevention, MOH, to disseminate Decree No. 1706 on health facility waste management signed \nby the Minister of Health on 20 July 2004; health care waste management guidelines developed \nby WHO, adopted by the Government and translated into Lao; and the national integrated \nhealth care waste management plan.  \n \n92.  Performance monitoring system. The HSDP's overall impact, outcome, policies, and \ntargets are aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy results framework, as shown in the \ndesign and monitoring framework.  The HSDP targets four out of eight MDGs directly, and \nindirectly MDGs for gender, education, environment, and aid coordination. The HSDP supports \npillar  II,  Inclusive  Social  Development;  and  pillar  III,  Good  Governance  and  Capacity \nDevelopment.  \n \n \n ", "22     \n93.  DPF will monitor implementation of all policy actions outlined in the policy matrix. DPF \nwill submit to ADB quarterly reports until the completion of the HSDP that provide an update on \nthe status of government policy actions, both in formulation and implementation. Data from the \ncensus, household surveys, service surveys, and HSDP implementation reports and documents \nwill be used to monitor progress. The national health information system will  be used for \nmonitoring health service performance, which will be supplemented with (i) impact and outcome \nassessment using the Health Systems Development Project household survey scheduled for \n2010 as a baseline, and an HSDP end-of-project survey in the fourth year; (ii) annual health \nservice survey including on village health care; (iii) monitoring of project activities and inputs; (iv) \nsocial and environmental studies; and (v) monitoring of project management and financing. \nParticular  attention  will  be  given  to  monitoring  benefits  for  the  poor,  in  particular  women, \nchildren, and ethnic groups.  \n \n94.  HSDP review. MOH will provide ADB with quarterly and annual reports on the progress \nof the HSDP and related policy issues. The reports should review progress milestones vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe achievement of indicators, identify issues, and propose adjustments, as needed. Within 3 \nmonths after each year following project effectiveness, MOH will submit to ADB an HSDP \nannual  report  summarizing  the  issues  related  to  HSDP  progress  and  compliance  with \ncovenants. The Government and ADB will conduct joint HSDP reviews, including midterm and \ncompletion  reviews.  The  reviews  will  focus  on  outcome,  activities,  inputs,  administration, \nprogram reforms, and institutional and sustainability aspects including aid coordination. The \nreviews will also examine compliance with social, environmental, financial, and other covenants \nin the grant agreement. MOH and the provincial authority will ensure that their staff members \nvisit the field often and join ADB in all review missions.  \n \nIV.   PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n95.  Sector benefits. The HSDP supports the implementation of the 6th and 7th national \nhealth sector development plans, and is aligned with the sector coordination work led by MOH, \nWHO, and the Government of Japan, with technical support of JICA. The HSDP advances MOH \nefforts in implementing the Vientiane Declaration by supporting a sector program approach that \nwill serve as a platform for sector program funding. The HSDP helps establish a fund-flow \nmodality  for  MOF  to  provide  external  program  funds  for  recurrent  budget  support  to  the \nprovinces,  thereby  providing  an  instrument  for  policy  compliance  and  improving  sector \nperformance. The lack of nonwage recurrent funds is a key constraint in sector performance, \nand improving this will help better the quality of operations, maintenance, staff incentives, and \naccess for the poor. In addition, the HSDP supports several policy reforms that will help the \nsector focus on priority areas, in particular MNCH, and improve staff standards and quality, \nwhich will improve overall sector effectiveness, equity, and efficiency.  \n \n96.  Improved  planning  and  financial  management  capacity  will  result  in  more  rational \nallocation of resources for recurrent costs and skills necessary to plan and monitor expenditures \nfor uninterrupted flow of funds. This fundamental planning and financial management capacity \nwill make management more technically efficient leading to cost savings, and make resource \nallocation in the health sector more efficient. In terms of sustainability, the HSDP will provide \nand stimulate critical bridge funding until domestic health financing improves to provide the \ncountry a head start in modernizing its health care system.  \n \n \n ", "    23\n97.  Economic  and  financial  benefits.  The HSDP supports the achievement of MDGs \nthrough cost-effective interventions targeting the poor, women, children, and ethnic groups, and \nwill reduce illness and premature death, thereby improving productivity and income. Resource \nand out-of-pocket savings will result from increased access and better quality of services. \nProgram  funding  will  improve  overall  sector  efficiency  by  increasing  recurrent  operational \nspending so that past investments will be preserved and better used. Improved planning and \nfinancial  management  capacity  will  result  in  greater  efficiency  of  health  sector  financing. \nProgram funding will also pave the way for aid harmonization that is expected to result in further \nimprovement of efficiency and impact in the sector. Overall, program investment is expected to \nincrease the number of people receiving good quality health care, and will contribute directly to \nimproving productivity of the beneficiaries.  \n \n98.  Economic benefits will accrue from reduced health care costs as a result of decreased \nincidence and severity of illness. Benefits include (i) cost savings due to improved access to \nefficient and effective health services, and (ii) increased income through reduced sick leave or \ntime spent caring for the sick. Cost savings may arise from (i) reduced costs of curative services \nas  a  result  of  improved  access  to  prevention  and  health  promotion  services;  (ii)  reduced  \nout-of-pocket expenditures, mainly transport costs due to improved access to health services; \nand (iii) more efficient and rational diagnoses and treatments that reduce treatment cost.35 In \naddition, gains and investments in women\u2019s health will have positive impacts on reducing the \ncountry\u2019s population growth rate, improving the health and welfare of children and families, and \nreducing  health  costs  and  contributing  to  poverty  reduction.  Details  of  the  economic  and \nfinancial analysis are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n99.  Social impacts. The HSDP will increase the access and quality of health services and \nimprove the health of the population in general, particularly for women, children, ethnic groups, \nand the poor, and thereby help achieve MDGs. Increased recurrent funding for operation and \nmaintenance  costs  will  increase  accessibility  and  quality  of  health  care  services  for  the \npopulation  at  large  (and  women,  children,  and  disadvantaged  ethnic  groups  in  particular). \nIncreased access to preventive and curative care will lead to improvements in health status, \nimproved quality of care to reduce the number of treatments and recurrence of illness, and \nbetter access for vulnerable groups. Cost-effective PHC will lead to decreases in maternal \nmortality, infant and child mortality, and general morbidity. Health equity funds will provide free \nhealth care services to the poor and, as a result, use of health services by the poor will \nincrease, and equity in the distribution of health services will be improved.  \n \n100.  The program and project investments will provide significant benefits for the poorest \ngroups, including improved health care for women, children, disadvantaged ethnic groups, the \npoor, and those living in remote areas; an increase in the number of deliveries done at hospitals \nand health centers; and increased use of health services and health care facilities by the poor. \nImproved  health  care  for  the  poor,  ethnic  groups,  women,  and  those  living  in  remote \ncommunities will result from increased access to MNCH services, strengthened planning and \nfinancial  management  capacity  of  the  public  health  system,  improved  quality  of  HRH \n(particularly  skilled  birth  attendants),  and  expanded  health  care  financing  and  affordability. \nThese elements will ensure the reduction of maternal and child mortality and diminish the key \nconstraints in access to health care services, especially in remote and rural areas. Quality \ncontrol  mechanisms  for  health  professionals  and  facilities,  through  provincial-level  annual \noperation plans and guidelines for district health systems, should disproportionately benefit \n                                                 \n35 Bloom and Choynowski. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "24     \nthose with the poorest quality services and health workers. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n101.  Gender. Despite impressive gains on key health outcomes, there are wide variations \nand persistent inequities in health indicators by area. Women and adolescent girls in poor, \nremote, and ethnic group communities are particularly affected by the limited access to quality \nhealth services and lack of ethnically sensitive health staff members. Also, while the health care \nworkforce is predominantly female (58%), the majority of them are concentrated in medium-level \npositions. MOH aims to increase the proportion of women in higher- and lower-level positions \nand ensure that all program activities are consistent with the provisions of the 2004 Law on the \nDevelopment and Promotion of Women. The gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10) \noutlines provisions and specific actions to ensure that women will receive access to resources \nequally. \n \n102.  Ethnic  groups.  Poverty  rates  and  health  indicators  lag  substantially  among \nmarginalized ethnic groups. A 2006 survey found that most of the poorest women and women in \nmountainous areas delivered babies at home, compared with about 4% of well-off women.36 \nLong distances to the nearest health facility and lack of transport, lack of qualified health staff \nand equipment in health centers in remote areas, and lack of ethnic group health workers or \nthose who speak relevant languages at the health centers and district hospitals discourage \npoor, rural, and ethnic groups from seeking health care. Significant gaps remain in the staffing \nof health facilities in remote areas. The HSDP supports a number of measures to address the \ndeficiencies and inequities in the health care system, particularly through improvements in the \ntraining of ethnic group health workers and in the incentives and support provided to the health \ncare workforce in rural and remote areas. These are integral to the policy matrix and further \nsupported and expanded on in the gender and ethnic group action plan (Appendix 10). \n \n103.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  civil  works  were  reviewed,  and  no  land \nacquisition and resettlement issues have been identified or are expected. Civil works are limited \nto renovation and upgrading of health facilities on existing government land, while there is no \nknowledge of any squatters or other use of this government land. The summary land acquisition \nand resettlement framework is in Appendix 11. \n \n104.  Environmental aspects. The main environmental concern is solid and medical waste \nmanagement. Most health facilities separate waste but the subsequent handling is inadequate. \nThe Project will support MOH plans to roll out improved waste management in health facilities, \nbased on WHO guidelines. A specialized institution will advise MOH whether to use incinerators \nor other technology. A summary initial environmental examination (Appendix 12) and initial \nenvironmental  examination  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  have  been  prepared.  Individual \nsubprojects have been categorized as environmental category C as environmental impact is \nconsidered  minimal.  However,  overall,  the  Project  has  been  categorized  as  environmental \ncategory B (non-sensitive) in view of its overall sector implications.   \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n105.  Program  modality. The innovative nature of the design requires a buy-in from the \nGovernment  and  development  partners.  The  program  funding  modality  and  fund-flow \nmechanism for the health sector is new in the Lao PDR, and requires agreement from MOH and \nMOF, and in principle, concurrence from partners. To date, full support has been confirmed. \n                                                 \n36 National Statistical Center. Government of the Lao PDR. 2007. Multiple Index Cluster Survey III. Vientiane.  \n ", "    25\n106.  Financial management capacity. MOH and provinces lack experience in implementing \nprogram  grants,  and  have  limited  capacity  in  financial  management.  Delays  in  preparing \nrelevant budget and expenditure documents in accordance with rules and regulations may lead \nto  delayed recurrent  budget  support.  This  is  mitigated by  project  investment  in  training in \nplanning, procedures for accounting, auditing and financial management at all levels, use of a \nspecial account, and monitoring. \n \n107.  Fund-flow  mechanism.  The  fund-flow  mechanism  is  standardized  and  will  be \nimplemented in all provinces. However, each provincial authority will need to agree to this fund-\nflow mechanism to access the funds. Pre-project capacity development technical assistance is \nhelping set this up to ease the transition to the modality in each province. \n \n108.  Recurrent cost funding. Domestic public spending for recurrent costs in the health \nsector is low, in particular low nonsalary recurrent spending at the provincial level (about 14% of \ntotal recurrent expenditures). Low recurrent funding undermines past investments and threatens \nthe operational viability of the public health system, especially at the lowest levels where poor \nwomen, children, and ethnic groups often receive care. Program funding mitigates this risk and \nhelps improve efficiency, equity, and effectiveness of services. \n \n109.  Sustainability. Program funding will help bridge the financing gap until Nam Theun 2 \nrevenue becomes more substantial. Expected revenue allocations to the health sector will be \nabout $1 million in 2010, and gradually increase to cover a substantial part of recurrent cost \nrequirements by 2020, if allocated as such. This will mitigate the sustainability risk of program \nfunding. Expected technical efficiency gains from increased capacity in planning and financial \nmanagement will well-position MOH for approval of Nam Theun 2 proposals for future funding.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n110.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances. which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Policy adoption and actions. The Government will ensure that the policies \nadopted and actions taken, as described in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4), continue in effect for the duration and beyond the \nprogram period. \n \n(ii)  Use of program grant funds. The Government will ensure that (a) counterpart \nfunds in an amount equivalent to the program funds are made available to the \nparticipating  provinces  for  nonsalary  recurrent  budget  support  in  the  health \nsector, and will not be used to pay for any costs accruing prior to the effective \ndate or for payment of electricity bills; and (b) the counterpart funds equivalent to \nthe  program  funds  are  completely  additional  to  the  nonsalary  recurrent \nexpenditures accrued in FY2009, in real terms, for the duration of the program \ngrant. \n \n(iii)  Project counterpart financing. The Government will ensure that the counterpart \nfinancing necessary for the Project is provided in time, and that MOH, through \nDPF, makes available all funds and resources necessary for construction and \noperation and maintenance of the Project on a timely basis. MOH will further \n ", "26     \nensure  that  additional  counterpart  funding  is  available  to  cover  any  funding \nshortfalls that may occur during project implementation. \n \n(iv)  Resettlement. MOH will ensure that in the event that any resettlement impacts \nare detected for an activity, (a) a resettlement plan for such activity in accordance \nwith  the  project  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy is prepared; (b) resettlement plans are prepared \non the basis of the detailed technical design, disclosed to affected persons, and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval;  and  (c)  all  compensation  and \nrehabilitation assistance is paid before dispossession of assets. The summary \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  full \nresettlement framework and plan is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n(v)  Gender and ethnic group action plan. MOH will ensure that the gender and \nethnic group action plan is fully implemented and that all project activities are \ndesigned and implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) including, but not \nlimited to (a) 40% female participation in HSDP-supported training programs; (b) \ninclusion of equitable provisions relating to the MNCH, gender, and ethnic groups \nin annual operation plan and budget; (c) inclusion of provisions for gender and \nethnic groups for all targets relating to workforce and consumers in all guidelines, \nterms of reference, policies, master plans, strategies, and action plans developed \nunder the HSDP; and (d) disaggregating all monitoring and evaluation data by \ngender and ethnicity. The gender and ethnic group action plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n(vi)  Environment. MOH will ensure that the construction and/or upgrading of all \nhealth facilities comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the Recipient, \ninitial environmental examination, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. MOH shall \nfurther ensure that (a) ADB is informed if the construction and/or upgrading of \nany health facility requires the removal of hazardous materials; (b) Decree No. \n1706 on health facility waste management and the national integrated health \ncare  waste  management  plan  is  disseminated;  and  (c)  health  care  waste \nmanagement guidelines developed by WHO are translated into Lao and are \nadopted by the recipient. The summary initial environmental examination is in \nAppendix 12. \n \n(vii)  Internal  financial  control.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Internal \nFinancial Control Unit, the Department of Planning and Finance of MOH, has \nbeen  empowered  to  conduct  periodic  inspection  of  program  accounts  in  the \nprovinces and districts. \n \nB.  Condition for Grant Effectiveness and Disbursements \n111.

The  Government  of  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  made \nsignificant but inadequate progress toward reaching Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in \nthe country\u2019s health sector.1 Maternal and child mortality have been reduced substantially, and \nwater and sanitation coverage are likely to surpass targets. However, malnutrition remains high, \nand the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to spread.   \n \n2.  From 1995 to 2005, the infant mortality rate reduced from 104 to 70 per 1,000 live births, \nand under age 5 years mortality has fallen from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births. Nearly half of \ninfant deaths (46%) are due to neonatal causes, and 60% occur in the first week of life. Many of \nthese deaths are due to the mother\u2019s poor health or inadequate care during and after pregnancy \nand childbirth, particularly among populations living in remote areas. By 2006, 70% of children \nunder age 1 year received immunization against measles, although there is some disagreement \nregarding the accuracy of this figure.2 Fully 87% of children under age 5 years sleep under a \nbed net, but only 43% sleep under an insecticide-treated net.3 Nearly three quarters of the \npopulation  have  access  to  clean  drinking  water,  and  nearly  one  half  use  safe  sanitation \nfacilities.4 Unmet demand for family planning is also a factor. \n \n3.  The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 650 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 405 \nper 100,000 live births in 2005, among the highest rates in Asia and the Pacific.5 The most \ncommon  immediate  causes  of  these  deaths  are  hemorrhages,  obstructed  labors,  \npregnancy-induced  hypertension,  and  sepsis.  It  is  estimated  that  family  planning  has  the \npotential to reduce maternal deaths by 25%\u201340%, skilled birth attendants by 13%\u201333%, and \nemergency obstetric care by 70%. From 1995 to 2005, the number of births attended by a \nskilled birth attendant increased from 14% to 23% (51% urban, 10% rural). Women's survival \ndepends on timely access to quality emergency obstetric care; physical access to hospitals \nwithin a 2-hour travel distance is still below 50% in rural Lao PDR. This is compounded by late \nreferral, lack of qualified personnel, and the relatively high cost of transport and services. \nCoverage of antenatal care (at least one visit) rose from 21.0% in 2000 to 28.5% in 2005. \nAccess to antenatal care is lowest in rural areas without roads (9%). Uptake of antenatal care \nalso increases sharply with women\u2019s education.   \n \n4.  The total fertility rate declined from 4.88 children per woman in 2000 to 4.07 children per \nwoman in 2005.6 The significant progress in modern contraceptive access and use suggests a \nremarkable change in childbearing behavior among women in the last decade. Contraceptive \nprevalence  doubled  from  1994  to  2005.  By  2005,  38%  of  eligible  women  were  using  a \ncontraceptive method. However, rural access to contraceptives remains limited.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Committee for Planning and Investment, Lao PDR. 2008.

Information collected on this indicator in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) III indicates \nthat 67% of children surveyed had vaccination cards, less than 15% of the children had all eight recommended \nvaccinations by age 1 year, while  measles vaccine by age 1 year was only 33%.  \n3  National Statistical Centre of the Lao PDR. 2007.

The prevalence of underweight children under age 5 years has remained fairly constant, \nfrom 44% in 1993 to 37% in 2005 (footnote 3).7 Fifty-nine percent of all child deaths in the Lao \nPDR  is  related  to  nutritional  deficiencies.8  Poor  breast-feeding  and  weaning  practices  are \nwidespread.  Most  mothers  give  food  supplements  to  infants  within  a  few  weeks  of  birth. \nChildren  with  better  road  access  were  found  to  be  equally  malnourished.9  Micronutrients \ndeficiencies such as of iodine, iron, and vitamin A are common. According to a 2007 survey, \n37% of women of reproductive age and 41% of children under age 5 years are suffering from \nmoderate anemia (footnote 3). Forty-five percent of the children under age 5 years is shown to \nbe suffering from vitamin A deficiencies.10 Distribution of vitamin A capsules reaches only 29% \nof children under age 5 years. Twenty-seven percent of school-aged children and 13% of \nwomen  of  reproductive  age  are  found  to  be  at  risk  of  developing  goiters  or  other  \niodine-deficiency disorders. In 2007, 75% of households were using iodized salt (footnote 3). \nMalnutrition in women not only undermines their health and opportunities but also increases the \nincidence and fatality rate of complications in pregnancy and childbirth.  \n \n6.  Communicable diseases still cause the largest burden of diseases. Main causes of \nillness  are  diarrheal  diseases,  malaria,  measles,  and  common  respiratory  infections.  The \ntuberculosis prevalence rate has also not declined.11 While the HIV prevalence is increasing in \nthe general population, it's probably decreasing in female sex workers as the number of sex \nworkers may have increased in recent years due to increasing income disparities and other \nfactors. The country experienced outbreaks of influenza, anthrax, cholera, dengue fever, and \nother emerging diseases. Helminthiasis has a major impact on education and productivity.     \n \n7.  Data on noncommunicable diseases are limited. The burden of road accidents is high at \ntwice the rate found in neighboring countries. Tobacco and alcohol addiction also have major \nimpacts on health, health services, and household incomes.  \n \nB.  Sector Organization  \n \n8.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for health, nutrition, population, and rural \ndevelopment,  including  small-scale  water  and  sanitation,  and  also  coordinates  multisector \nprograms such as those for HIV/AIDS and avian influenza. It has seven departments: (i) the \nCabinet, (ii) Curative, (iii) Food and Drugs, (iv) Hygiene and Prevention, (v) Inspection, (vi) \nOrganization and Personnel, and (vii) Planning and Finance. MOH has a national steering \ncommittee for health that oversees all MOH activities, including projects. MOH also operates \ncentrally managed priority programs linked to a specific MOH department and often also specific \ndevelopment partners, in particular for maternal and child health and communicable diseases \ncontrol. \n \n9.  By  2008,  in  17  provinces  and  139  districts,  there  were  4  central,  4  specialized,  4 \nregional, 12 provincial, and 126 district hospitals. Regional hospitals provide a wider range of \nspecialist services than provincial hospitals and are also centers for training and technical \nsupervision. Under each provincial committee for health of the provincial authority, the provincial \n                                                 \n7  Government of the Lao PDR and United Nations. 2009.

In each \nprovince, a primary health care (PHC) coordination office under the provincial health officer has \nresponsibility for PHC activities.  \n \n10.  District hospitals serve small catchment populations of 10,000\u201350,000 people. The 26 \n\u201ctype  A\u201d  district  hospitals  are  expected  to  conduct  surgery  requiring  anesthesia,  including \ncaesarean sections. The 100 \u201ctype B\u201d hospitals only conduct minor surgery. Under each district \nhealth committee, the district health office supervises health centers, the village health program, \nand other services like food security to ensure regular and good-quality service.  \n \n11.  The 789 health centers also serve small catchment populations of 1,000\u20135,000 people. \nThe  functions  of  the  health  centers  are  prevention,  health  promotion,  and  diagnosis  and \ntreatment of diseases within their capacity. Like hospitals, health centers manage drug revolving \nfunds to sustain service. Under the supervision of the district health office, the health center \nsupervises and monitors village health care providers, and coordinates between villages and the \ndistrict. \u201cType A\u201d health centers with five staff members are headed by a doctor, and \u201ctype B\u201d \nhave three staff members headed by a medical assistant. One health center is a focal service \npoint for about eight villages.  \n \n12.  The village health committee ensures a healthy village environment, adequate village \nhealth care, and timely referral of emergencies. If more than a 2-hour walking distance from a \nhealth facility, the village will usually have a male and a female village health volunteer (VHV) \nand a drug revolving fund with a drug kit containing 11\u201333 essential drugs. There are 13,820 \nVHVs and 5,668 villages (54%) with drug kits. Members of mass organizations and others \nvolunteer as peer educators for health and nutrition promotion. Village private providers include \nformer paramedics and traditional healers. All are expected to promote good hygiene (i.e., clean \nwater, food, body, clothes, and environment). In 2008, there were 285 registered private clinics \nand 2,118 registered pharmacies, mainly urban. There are also many unlicensed drug shops \nand a host of illicit private drug vendors that often sell poor-quality or fake drugs.  \n \nC.  Use of PHC Network \n \n13.  The Government and MOH have emphasized equitable access to health services for all, \nespecially the poor and ethnic groups. Since adoption of the Primary Health Care Policy in \n2000, MOH has used PHC to expand its network of health facilities. MOH has tracked health-\nseeking behavior among wealth quintiles since 1999 to ascertain the impact of the PHC network \non access to care. VHVs and drug kits have substantially increased access for the poor and \nethnic groups living in remote areas. Time series data from 1999 to 2008 in the eight northern \nprovinces  for  use  of  VHVs,  health  centers,  and  district  hospitals  by  the  poorest  quintile \ndemonstrate substantial increase in use of services by the poor.  \n \n14.  Among the poorest quintile, utilization of VHVs has increased significantly. In 1999, only \n3% of the poorest quintile sought care from VHVs. In 2008, nearly 33% of the poorest quintile \nsought care at VHVs. Access to high-quality drugs distributed by a person in the village who has \nreceived training in the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases has significantly improved \naccess to health services for the poor as well. A similarly dramatic pattern of increased care can \nbe seen for health centers, and to a lesser extent for district hospitals. Data on health-seeking \nbehavior in the second-poorest quintile demonstrate the same utilization trends.   \n \n15.  MOH recently rolled out a new countrywide health information system to collect health \nservice statistics. The 2008 series in Table A2.1 is the dataset since time series data are not \n ", " 34  Appendix 2 \navailable for trend comparisons. Reporting is probably incomplete, in particular for immunization \nand skilled birth attendance, as the data indicate even lower utilization than what is being \ncollected from household surveys. However, it is considered a good start.  \n  \nTable A2.1: Utilization Data for Specific Indicators from the Ministry of Health \nHealth Information System, 2008 \n \nCountry/Province  TT2%  SBA%  FIC%  Vit A2%  OPD/1,000  IPD/1,000  BOR% \nLao PDR   20  21  25  15  256  8  40 \nVientiane (Capital)  16  7  20  34  242  8  15 \nPhongsali  3  8  6  16  66  10  12 \nLuang Namtha  29  23  13  0  193  38  52 \nOudomxay  10  3  13  0  482  34  26 \nBokeo  4  16  14  0  237  47  46 \nLuang Prabang  20  25  22  0  130  30  29 \nHouaphanh  5  8  5  0  200  32  27 \nXaignabouli  17  26  34  23  240  42  47 \nXieng Khouang  8  24  10  8  401  62  81 \nVientiane Province  21  27  36  6  401  42  52 \nBolikhamsai  13  24  28  33  218  53  45 \nKhammouane  23  22  28  33  265  66  41 \nSavannakhet  34  29  27  6  260  35  37 \nSalavan  10  20  40  24  183  42  41 \nXekong  13  16  36  75  251  39  27 \nChampassak  28  29  29  29  278  44  56 \nAttapeu  43  14  27  12  244  40  31 \nBOR = bed occupancy rate; FIC = full immunization coverage by age 12 months; IPD/1,000 = inpatients per 1,000 \npeople;  OPD/1,000  =  outpatient  department  visits  per  1,000  people;  SBA  =  skilled  birth  attendance;  \nTT2 = tetanus-toxoid vaccination for pregnant women; Vit A2 = second dose of vitamin A.  \nSource: Ministry of Health  \n \n16.  A  more  accurate  picture  of  health  service  use  by  province  can  be  obtained  from \nhousehold surveys in the eight northern provinces supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in 2004 and 2006. In these samples, use of preventive health services still remains low. \nHowever, in the eight provinces combined and in four individual provinces, there has been a \ngreat increase in coverage of all nine preventive indicators. Luang Prabang Province showed \npoor performance, where only two indicators improved and two declined, followed by Phongsali \nProvince. \n \nD.   Sector Plans, Policies, and Priorities \n \n17.  The Government\u2019s overall vision for the health sector is formulated in the MOH Health \nStrategy up to the Year 202012 approved in 2001, and the Policy on Primary Heath Care (2000) \nthat directly addresses the MDGs. Essentially, the Government aims to achieve health for all \nthrough a national public health system based on the principles of PHC, while continuing to \nprovide services financed through universal health insurance and local and central revenues \nfrom various sources.  \n \n18.  Public financing of services will continue to be needed in rural areas given high levels of \npoverty and considerable market failure. Capacity for service delivery is also limited in rural \nareas,  with  limited  potential  for  contracting  services.  However,  in  2009,  the  Government \napproved a new law for nongovernment organizations, which will help increase capacity for \nnonpublic services. It also encourages private sector development, and urban areas have seen \n                                                 \n12\n MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2000.

More recently, in view \nof  a  traditional  high  burden  of  communicable  diseases  and  a  potential  escalation  of \nnoncommunicable diseases with increasing income, the Government has also been promoting \nthe concept of the model healthy village as the centerpiece of its PHC approach.  \n \n13\n19.  MOH is also implementing the 6th Health Sector Development Plan, 2006\u20132010.  The \nmidterm review of the plan identified eight priorities: (i) healthy village development, including \naccess to quality health care, access to clean water and sanitation, safe environment, and \nhealth and nutrition promotion; (ii) maternal mortality reduction through birth spacing, antenatal \nvisits, safe delivery, timely referrals, management of emergency obstetric care, and postnatal \nvisits; (iii) increased child survival through neonatal care, exclusive breast-feeding promotion, \nfull  immunization,  and  integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses;  (iv)  preparedness, \nprevention, and control of natural and epidemic disasters; (v) human resources for health to \ndeliver high-quality care; (vi) organizational and management strengthening; (vii) sustainable \nhealth care financing, including increased public financing for the health sector at all levels; and \n(viii)  creative  implementation  of  the  Vientiane  Declaration  for  Aid  Effectiveness  through \nownership; aid harmonization; making foreign assistance results-based, efficient, transparent, \nand accountable; and aiming to mobilize and efficiently use donor support.  \n \n20.  The 7th Health Sector Development Plan, 2010\u20132014, is the centerpiece of the MOH \npolicy agenda for the next 5 years. The plan contains objectives, priorities, strategies, targets, \nand medium-term expenditure projections for each province and MOH that will be required for \nthe next 5-year planning period to meet MDG targets for health.  \n \n21.  MOH  has  prepared  a  comprehensive  national  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health \n(MNCH) strategy14 to increase and integrate resources toward reductions in the maternal, infant, \nand child mortality rates. The strategy focuses on health system improvements for both supply \nand demand issues, including MNCH leadership and management, access to quality services, \nnutrition promotion, and social mobilization. MOH will gradually roll out services based on \nMNCH standards for hospitals, health centers, and model healthy villages. \n \n22.  The model healthy village program seeks to inculcate community ownership for the \nhealth of the family and village and to improve the village environment, family health and \nnutrition, and social protection within the village. MOH has issued guidelines for the piloting of \nthe approach in two villages per district. Along with other partners, ADB will support this through \na Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project of $3 million.15 This will be followed by developing \nstandards and a countrywide plan for rolling out model healthy villages. \n \n23.  To support the 7th Health Sector Development Plan, MOH has prepared a draft national \nhuman resources for health policy with support of the working group. The policy aims to develop \na professional health workforce that can provide high-quality services. It provides goals, guiding \nprinciples, a conceptual framework, and strategic directions that will guide human resources \ndevelopment for the health sector, and includes a plan for skilled birth attendance; accreditation \nof teaching institutions; and regulations for licensing, continuing education, and recertification of \nhealth professionals. This is expected to be approved by the Prime Minister in January 2010, \n                                                 \n13  MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

The  Government  emphasizes  equitable  access  to  health  services  for  all  people, \nespecially for the poor and ethnic groups. Cost recovery was introduced in 1995 and modified in \n2007  to  address  resource  constraints  in  operating  services.  While  it  helped  improve  and \nincrease the use of services, the poor cannot often afford health services and related costs or \nresort to selling assets. Among others, MOH introduced health equity funds, which are showing \ngood results in bridging the financing gap for the poor and creating capacity for expanding \nhealth insurance. MOH is preparing a national health financing plan with three major objectives: \n(i)  achieving  universal  coverage  in  pooled  risk  social  protection  schemes,  (ii)  establishing \nmechanisms for sustainable financing of hospitals, and (iii) attracting private investment to the \nhospital sector.  \n \n25.  The implementation of past policies has varied considerably. Factors that influence the \ndegree of policy implementation are the level of national and provincial priority, availability of \nfinancing, existing capacity, and coordination among levels and partners. A major issue is that \nMOH policy and financial leverage with provinces is limited due to the highly decentralized setup \nand tied to MOH leadership, goodwill, and externally financed projects. The expectation is that a \nnational program approach can pull these policies together and provide provincial support for \nimplementing them in the form of recurrent budget support.  \n \n26.  Provincial  capacity  for  sector  reform  has  been  developing,  but  there  is  substantial \nprovincial variation, with about one third of provinces demonstrating substantial capacity in \npreparing plans and budgets (e.g., Oudomxay, Xaignabouli, Xieng Khouang, Savannakhet, and \nVientiane  Province),  one  third  making  a  reasonable  effort,  and  one  third  clearly  being \nsubstandard. It is noted that these provinces have had more intensive and longer external \nassistance, including support.        \n \n27.  Following the Vientiane Declaration and examples in other sectors, MOH is keen to \ndevelop a sector program approach. With support from the World Health Organization and the \nGovernment of Japan, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been assisting \nMOH with the establishment of a secretariat and aid coordination mechanism.16 It circulated the \ndraft terms of reference of the sector-wide coordination mechanism for health on 15 June 2009, \nand the expected outcome is the joint formulation, management, and monitoring of a single \nsector program agreed on among MOH and development partners.  \n \n28.  Sector  working  groups  have  been  established  at  the  policy  level  (e.g.,  diplomatic \nrepresentatives),  operational  level,  and  technical  level\u2014including  three  technical  working \ngroups for PHC programs (with a major focus on MNCH), human resources development, and \nhealth financing. There are other working groups outside this framework, such as for HIV/AIDS \nand avian influenza, and discussions are ongoing on how to integrate these. A separate working \ngroup for health systems management and information system is being considered to address a \nrange of program implementation issues such as provincial administrative capacity building, the \nflow of funds, and annual operational plans. The identified priorities are being combined into a \nsingle sector program approach. The building blocks for this approach are summarized in Table \nA2.2.  \n \n                                                 \n16\n JICA.

Human Resources \n \n29.  The number of MOH staff members per capita has remained relatively constant at \nalmost 2 per 1,000 population over the past 10 years. The net increase in the workforce has \nbeen below 2%, which is below the population growth rate and implies that the national ratio of \n ", " 38  Appendix 2 \nhealth workers per capita has fallen. The Government gives priority to improving staff wages \nand quality, rather than increasing the number of staff members. In March 2008, there were \n12,013  active  personnel  employed  in  the  health  sector  workforce.17  Active  staff  members \nincluded 2,191 high-level (20%), 3,765 mid-level (34%) and 4,916 low-level (45%).18 Of these, \n29% work in administration. Staff members are distributed between central (19%), provincial \n(33%), district (39%), and village or health center (10%) levels. Women comprise 58% of the \npublic health sector workforce, but only 40% at health centers. The Lao comprise 89% of the \nworkforce, compared to 65% of the Lao population.   \n \n30.  Of the 20,107 volunteers or village providers in the Lao PDR in 2005, 13,702 were \nVHVs; 5,241 traditional birth attendants; 540 village health practitioners; and 624 traditional \nhealers. While not employed by MOH, these providers are seen as an essential element in the \ndelivery of health services, especially in remote and mountainous rural areas where travel from \nvillages to health centers is difficult. All VHVs, village health practitioners, and most traditional \nbirth attendants have had at least some short-course training by MOH. \n \n31.  On average, there were 2.1 health workers in health centers in 2005 compared to a \ntarget  of  3  health  workers  to  provide  care  and  outreach.  Twenty-three  percent  of  district \nhospitals in the northern provinces did not have any medical doctors when surveyed in 2006, \ncompared to a standard of four doctors per hospital. The majority of staff working in district \nhospitals and health centers is low-level health workers who lack necessary skills to provide \nquality care. Redistribution of staff members is difficult, as poorer provincial authorities lack \nfunds to absorb them. In 2005, 39% of new recruits were placed at the central level.   \n \n32.  PHC workers and mid-level technical nurses are trained in regional public health schools \nthroughout the country. Concerted efforts have been made to improve their training and to \nincrease  the  number  of  ethnic  group  and  female  health  workers.  The  College  of  Health \nTechnology in Vientiane provides pre-service training for mid-level health workers and post-\nbasic bachelor\u2019s degrees for nurses. It provided direct entry midwifery training from 1987 to \n1990. In 1990, the course was combined with nursing and upgraded to the technical nurse \ncourse in 2004. Graduates are expected to be multiskilled nurse-midwives.19 Pre-service training \nfor high-level staff members takes place at the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane. The \nNational  Institute  of  Public  Health  and  the  Francophone  Institute  of  Tropical  Medicine  in \nVientiane provide some postgraduate training. Overcrowding of teaching institutions is common \nas more private students are admitted than can be provided with quality education; therefore, it \nwill be necessary to reduce (fee-paying) private students. Further improvement also requires \nbetter facilities, teaching skills, skills training, coordination of training, and follow-up of trainees \nto support them in applying their new skills. \n \nF.  Health Planning and Financing \n \n33.  Since decentralization in 2000, MOH and provincial health authorities independently \nprepare their budget proposals for the health sector. Provincial recurrent health budgets are \nclosely linked to the number of personnel assigned by MOH to both provincial and district levels.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Department of Organization and Personnel, Lao PDR. 2005. Statistics of Health Staff in Lao PDR, 2005. Vientiane. \n18 High-level professionals have a university degree or equivalent. Mid-level staff members have completed 3 years \nof study after graduation from high school, and include nurses and medical assistants. Low-level staff members \nhave 2 years of vocational training, such as auxiliary nurses and primary health care workers.  \n19 However, MOH is considering splitting nursing and midwifery, which, in the Lao context with a highly scattered \npopulation and small hospitals, may be less optimal. \n ", "                                                                                                              Appendix 2  39 \n34.  The allocation of nonpersonnel components of the recurrent health budget is driven \nmainly by what is left after paying for salaries, previous allocations, and Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) budget norms. Health facilities mainly finance nonwage recurrent expenses from user \nfees  and  drug  revolving  funds.20  Depending  on  the  status  of  the  financial  management \nperformance of the facility, income may not be officially retained and used without passing \nthrough the treasury. Districts may also receive separate support for recurrent expenditures \nthrough donor assistance. While user fees and donor funding supplement nonwage recurrent \nspending, it remains very low.   \n \n35.  Perhaps the major challenge confronting the health sector to achieve the MDG targets is \nthe  extremely  low  level  of  public  financing.  In  2005,  government  health  spending  (i.e., \ndomestically financed and development partners) was about 1% of the gross domestic product. \nLow public health spending results in high out-of-pocket expenses by the population for health \ncare in public facilities (Table A2.3) and low use of health services, causing more health risks. \n \nTable A2.3:  Regional Spending on Health, 2005a  \n(%) \nItem  Cambodia Lao PDR Mongolia Thailand  Viet Nam\nExpenditure per Capita  $29  $19  $35  $98  $37 \nTotal Health Expenditure/GDP   1.6  0.7  3.3  2.2  1.5 \nPublic Expenditure on Health/Total \nGovernment Expenditure  12.0  4.1  11.0  11.3  5.1 \nPrivate Spending on Health/Total Health \nSpending  75.8  79.4  22.5  36.1  74.3 \nOut-of-Pocket Health Expenditure/Private \nExpenditure on Health  79.3  92.7  86.5  76.6  86.1 \nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People's Democratic Republic. \na Or latest available year. \nSource: World Development Indicators, online database, 2008. \n \n36.  Table A2.4 gives health expenditures per capita by financing source in 2005. Total \nhealth expenditure per capita from all sources in 2005 was $19.60, well below the $34.00 \nrecommended  standard  for  developing  countries.  The  share  of  domestically  financed \ngovernment health spending in total health expenditure was 9.7% in 2005. Generous foreign \nfinancing has kept the share of government health spending in total health expenditure at \n33.7%, with the remaining 66.3% coming from household out-of-pocket expenditures.  \n \n37.  Most of government recurrent spending is dedicated to salaries, comprising 83% in \nFY2007. Large expenditures in foreign financial aid may have created substantial inefficiencies \nthrough  an  excessive  focus  on  investment  without  adjusting  for  recurrent  expenditures. \nNonwage recurrent expenditures by the government comprise only 17% of total government \nexpenditures, which is a major constraint for effective service delivery. District hospitals and \nhealth centers primarily rely on small off-budget margins obtained from the sale of medicines to \npay for operation and maintenance.   \n \n                                                 \n20 Drug revolving funds are off-budget and are therefore outside the scope of the formal budget preparation process. \n ", " 40  Appendix 2 \n38.  According to government policy (Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 52 of 1995), the poor and \nseveral other groups (i.e., civil servants and their families, monks, and students in government \nschools)  are  supposed  to  be  exempt  from  having  to  pay  user  fees  at  government  health \nfacilities. In practice, however, few of these exemptions seem to be made. In a recent survey of \nthree northern provinces, for example, less than one third of 1% received free services from a \npublic health provider.21  \n \nTable A2.4:  Health Expenditure per Capita by Financing Source, 2005 \n(current $) \n \nFinancing Source  Expenditure Per Capita \nGovernment (domestically financed)  1.90 \nCentral Ministry of Health  0.45 \nProvinces   1.45 \nDonors  3.70 \nNongovernment Organizations  1.00 \nHouseholds  12.90 \nRisk Pooling  0.10 \nTotal Per Capita ($)  19.60 \nHealth Spending (%)   \nDomestically financed (%)  9.7 \nForeign-financed (%)  24.0 \nHousehold-financed (%)  66.3 \nSource:  Ministry of Health, Lao People's Democratic Republic; United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific, World Health Organization, International Labour Organization. 2008.

There is substantial evidence that the non-poor receive more health sector services. \nMOH is making efforts to make health care more affordable, for example, by improving cost \nrecovery and promoting community-based health insurances and health equity funds for the \nvery poor. None of the three formal health insurance schemes (civil servant health insurance, \nsocial security fund, and community-based health insurance), however, benefit the poor. These \nschemes, with a total coverage of less than 10% of the population, are not a viable option for \nmaking the services more affordable to the poor in the medium term. It will take a long time to \ncover the non-poor, given the current pace, capacity, use of services, and quality of care.22 \n \n40.  Health equity funds have been successfully pilot tested in a few districts to compensate \nhospitals and health centers for the \u201closs\u201d they incur when treating the poor. The fund currently \nis  being  tested  on  a  large  scale  in  Xieng  Khouang  Province  under  the  Health  System \nDevelopment Project,23 with two additional northern provinces scheduled for implementation in \n2009 and 2010. World Bank is pilot testing new health equity fund schemes in nine districts \nlocated  in  four  southern  provinces.  A  standardized  system  for  health  equity  funds  and  a \nstrategic plan for expansion are necessary to build on these pilot tests to develop a countrywide \nsystem. Health equity funds for those who cannot afford health care services are a basic \nbuilding block for universal coverage. \n                                                 \n21 Ministry of Health. 2008.

The policy level \nworking groups include heads of delegation. The operational level working group consists of \nrepresentatives of the departments of MOH and development partners. It meets twice a month. \nThere are three technical working groups: programs (with a focus on maternal, newborn and  \nand child health), human resources development, and financing.

JICA has three ongoing projects in the \nhealth sector: (i) Capacity Development for Sector-Wide Coordination in Health (August 2007\u2013\nAugust  2010);  (ii)  Project  for  Medical  Education  and  Research  for  Setthathirath  Hospital \n(December 2007\u2013November 2010) to improve the quality of undergraduate clinical training and \nearly postgraduate training at Setthathirath Hospital for graduates of the University of Health \nSciences; and (iii) Project for Human Resources Development of Nursing and Midwifery (May \n2005\u2013May 2010). This last project aims to strengthen the technical nurse training program at \nthe  five  regional  public  health  schools  in  Champassak,  Khammouane,  Luang  Prabang, \nOudomxay, and Savannakhet. It has provided new buildings and teaching equipment for each \nschool, assisted MOH to prepare a ministerial decree on nursing and midwifery regulations \nsigned in 2008, and improved the quality of clinical instruction in the hospitals associated with \nthese schools. \n \n3.  European Union. The EU provides budget support to the Government of the Lao PDR \nthrough Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations (PRSO), which is financed jointly by AusAID, \nEmbassy  of  Japan,  European  Commission,  and  World Bank.  Funds  are  released  into  the \ngeneral budget when policy triggers are met. In July 2008, under PRSO 5, the EU began \nproviding a variable tranche of \u20ac1.0 million (about $1.5 million) for the health sector. There are \ntwo benchmarks or triggers for the release of these funds: (i) increase in the recurrent budget \nallocation to the health sector, and (ii) increase in the number of health staff members working \nin 47 priority districts. These funds are then released as budget support to the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF). Achievement of these triggers are measured based upon a budget summary of \nallocations to the health sector produced by MOF and made available to PRSO. The EU has \nsubsequent plans for PRSO 6 in March 2010 and PRSO 7 (date not yet determined). In addition \nto the triggers under PRSO 5, PRSO 6 will have one additional benchmark for release of funds, \ni.e., the Government adopts a health financing strategy; and PRSO 7 will have one additional \nbenchmark, i.e., the Government implements a health financing strategy. The EU is prepared to \nprovide technical assistance to MOH to achieve these benchmarks. \n \n4.  Lux-Development S. A. Lux-Development commenced assistance to the health sector \nin 1996 when it constructed Maria Theresa Hospital in Vientiane Province. Since then, it has \n ", " 44  Appendix 3 \nsupported the Clinical Nurses School and PHC in six districts surrounding the Maria Theresa \nHospital; it has supported MOH\u2019s Medical Equipment Division, and it has provided vaccines and \nsupport to the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Lux-Development is preparing a \u20ac16.7 \nmillion  (about  $25.0  million)  project  that  will  (i)  support  health  system  development  in \nBolikhamxay, Khammouan, and Vientiane provinces; and (ii) support functional programs in the \nhealth sector including maternal, newborn, and child health; human resources development; \nmonitoring and evaluation; asset management; and health care financing. It is being envisaged \nthat this support will use a program planning mechanism at the outset, with the possibility of \nintroducing a program budget support mechanism in the future.   \n \n5.  World Bank. The World Bank-funded Health Services Improvement Project commenced \nin 2005 in the nine southern provinces. One component of the project provides district grants in \naid.  The  project  covers  79  districts.  Support  for  districts  in  Bolikhamxay,  Khammouan,  or \nVientiane provinces will be transferred to Lux-Development. The fund-flow mechanism for the \ngrants is as follows: (i) MOF transfers funds to an MOH account, (ii) MOH sends quarterly \nadvances to the districts, and (iii) advances are replenished quarterly. The average size of an \nannual grant is $8,000\u2013$10,000. There is a complex, process-oriented formula for allocating the \ngrants to each district. A portion of Nam theun 2 revenue will be earmarked for the health and \neducation sectors to increase funding for recurrent costs. The fund-flow arrangements have not \nbeen finalized.  \n \n6.  World Health Organization. WHO provides overall technical assistance in the sector, in \nparticular also in the areas of communicable disease control, maternal and child health, health \nfinancing, and health systems development. It also plays a key coordination role in the sector-\nwide coordination mechanism. \n \n7.  United Nations Population Fund. UNFPA focuses on reproductive health including \nbirth  spacing.  It  procures  contraceptive  supplies\u2014oral  contraceptives,  condoms,  and \nintrauterine devices\u2014for the entire country. It is also pilot testing a community-based distribution \nscheme in the provinces of Attapeu, Salavan, and Xekong. \n \n8.  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. UNICEF focuses on maternal, nenonatal and child \nhealth, in particular also maternal mortality reduction and immunization. All vaccines in the Lao \nPDR are procured via the UNICEF procurement system. UNICEF finances the vaccines and \noperational costs required to implement the Expanded Programme on Immunization in six \nprovinces. \n \n ", " \nTable A3.2: Major External Assistance to the Health Sector, 2005\u20132013  \n($ million) \n \n        Total \nExternal Agency  Project  Start  End  Obligated \nAsian Development Bank  Health System Development Project  2007  2011 13.0 \n       \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  Support to the Health Sector  2007  2012 10.3 \n       \nGlobal Agency for Vaccines and Immunization  Expanded Programme on Immunization  2008  2011 5.5 \n       \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria  Lao-405-G04-H  2005  2010 8.5 \n  Lao-405-G05-M  2005  2010 18.0 \n  Lao-405-G06-T  2005  2010 4.0 \n  Lao-407-G07-M  2007  2011 4.0 \n  Lao-607-G08-H  2007  2011 8.9 \n  Lao-708-G08-T  2008  2013 11.0 \n  Lao-708-G08-M  2008  2013 24.6 \n       \nJapan International Cooperation Agency  Medical Education and Research for Sithathirath Hospital  2007  2011 2.6 \n  Capacity Development for Sector-Wide Cooperation in Health  2006  2010 1.3 \n  Project for Human Resources Development of Nursing/Midwifery  2006  2010 2.7 \n \nGovernment of Luxembourg  Health Information System  2006  2011 12.5 \n       \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund  Health and Nutrition   2008  2011 5.2 \n       \nUnited Nations Population Fund  Support Maternal and Child Health Activity  2007  2011 3.5 \n  Support to Strengthen Health System  2007  2011 0.9 \n  Strengthen IEC/BCC  2008  2011 0.8 \n       \nWorld Bank  Avian Influenza - Surveillance and Monitoring  2006  2010 0.4 \n  Avian Influenza - Curative Services  2006  2010 1.7 \n \n  Health System Improvement Project  2006  2011 20.4    \n \n \n          \n \nWorld Health Organization  Communicable Disease Control, Health System Development, Human  2007  2009 2.7   A\nResource Planning, Child and Adolescent Health  pp\n            Total    162.5  en\nd\nIEC/BCC = information, education, and communication/behaviour change communication.  ix\nSource: Department of Planning and Finance, Ministry of Health, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.   3\n4               \n5\n \n ", "", "", "", " \nPolicy Matrix \nTranche 1 Policy Actions    Tranche 2 Policy Actions   \n(At grant effectiveness - $5 million)  Monitoring Indicators  (Within 24 months post effectiveness -  Monitoring Indicators \n$5 million)\n \n   \nOutput 1: Strengthened Planning and Financing   \nThe Ministry of Finance has  Following document will be submitted to  Provincial authorities have approved  Following documents will be \napproved the program funding  ADB:  results-based annual operational  submitted to ADB: \nmechanism for supplementary         plans and budgets that meet minimum        \nprogram support for the provincial  Copy of the Memorandum of  MOH standards.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Lao National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategya outlines the Government\u2019s commitment to reduce poverty. The \nstrategy has been integrated into the 6th Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010,b which aims to achieve economic \ngrowth of 7.5%\u20138.0% annually; reach $700\u2013$750 gross domestic product (GDP) per capita; create about 652,000 productive \njobs; and reduce the number of poor households to 15%. The plan identifies the health sector as one of four priority sectors \nand is committed to provide all with access to PHC to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and health for all. \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  2007\u20132011,  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)c is anchored in and closely aligned to the 6th Socio-Economic Development Plan. A results-based \nstrategy, the country strategy and program focuses on sustainable economic growth, accelerating progress in non-income \nMDGs, building capacity for good governance, promoting regional cooperation and integration as an engine of progress, and \nfostering national development through the country\u2019s own strategy and plans. The Government\u2019s health sector initiatives, \nincluding the Health Sector Development Program (the HSDP), are included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2009\u20132011.d The HSDP is also included in the areas targeted for development under the Poverty Reduction Partnership \nAgreement, signed on 28 September 2001, between the Government and ADB. ADB is also committed to support the \nVientiane Declaration for Aid Effectiveness.  \n \nIn line with the priorities of the Government and ADB, the HSDP focuses on maximizing past investments in the country\u2019s \nhealth sector by helping develop the national health sector program approach to improve overall health service delivery \ncountrywide in terms of effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and sustainability. The HSDP will support MDG attainment and PHC \ndelivery,  with  a  focus  on  maternal,  newborn,  and  child  health  (MNCH);  planning  and  financing;  human  resources \ndevelopment; and expanded health care financing for the poor through health equity funds. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. A small domestic market, subsistence nature of the rural \neconomy, skill shortages, and remoteness and isolation of  much of the population are among the structural factors \nconstraining growth and poverty reduction. However, the economy has grown and diversified in the last 5 years, based on the \ncountry\u2019s natural resources base for hydropower, mining, and tourism. Between 2002 and 2007, annual growth in the \ncountry\u2019s GDP, at constant prices, averaged 6%. The sustained economic growth over the last 5 years has greatly contributed \nto a sharp decline in poverty. From 33.5% in 2003, the poverty incidence fell to 22.3% in 2007, which can be attributed to (i) \nsound macroeconomic fundamentals coupled with prudent fiscal management; (ii) a decline in the unemployment rate from \n5.0% in 2001 to 1.4% in 2007; (iii) expansion of hydropower, mining, and tourism; and (iv) gradual shifting of the economy \nfrom agriculture to high value-added industry. From 49.8% in 2002, the share of agriculture to GDP has declined to 42.3% in \n2006 at constant prices. However, agriculture still provides 80% of national employment, and about 79% of the population \nlives in rural areas where livelihoods largely depend on this sector.  \n \nThe Lao PDR has a total area of 236,800 square kilometers, and two thirds of the country is mountainous. The country had a \nvery low population density of 25 persons per square kilometer based on its population of 5.6 million in 2005. The population \nis composed of 49 ethnic groups that are officially recognized by the Government, and which are grouped based on four \nethno-linguistic families: (i) Tai-Kadai, (ii) Mon-Khmer, (iii) Hmong, and (iv) Sino-Tibetan. Ethnic minorities more often live in \nthe  mountains,  with  less  access  to  social  services  and  markets.  Rural  areas  lack  infrastructure  (e.g.,  roads, \ntelecommunication, water, and electricity) and transport, more so in the north than in the central or southern parts of the \ncountry. Poverty rates and health indicators are lagging among marginalized ethnic groups. In addition to less physical \naccess, the poor, rural, and minority ethnic groups face lack of access due to relatively high out-of-pocket costs, lack of \nqualified health personnel in rural health centers, and lack of health care workers who speak the relevant languages. Village \nhealth volunteers, about two thirds of whom are male, have received short training and only deal with minor illnesses.  \n2.  Design Features  \nThe HSDP will provide significant benefits for the poorest groups, including improved health care services for women, \nchildren, disadvantaged ethnic groups, the poor, and those who live in remote areas. This will be achieved by increasing their \naccess to MNCH services, strengthening the planning and financing capacity of the public health system, and improving the \nquality of human resources for health (particularly skilled birth attendants). The HSDP is expected to lead to an increase in the \nuse of health services by the poor, including more deliveries done at hospitals and health centers, a reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality, and improved health outcomes for the poor. Quality control mechanisms for health professionals and facilities, \nthrough provincial-level annual operational plans and guidelines for district health systems, should disproportionately benefit \n ", "60   Appendix 9 \nthose with the poorest-quality services and health workers. The HSDP supports a number of measures to address the \ndeficiencies and inequities in the health care system, particularly through improvements in the training of health workers, \nincentives for staff members in rural and remote areas, and support for model healthy villages and health equity funds. The \nHSDP will help increase the roles of the poor, women, and small ethnic groups in local planning, consultation, and decision \nmaking  achieved  through  representation  on  village  health  committees,  located  within  existing  village  development \ncommittees, and as village health volunteers and health staff members. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe policy reforms included in the HSDP are expected to have a variety of positive impacts for health consumers, especially \nthose in poor and remote areas.   \n(i)  The preparation of annual operation plans and budgets and the fund-flow mechanism to provinces will improve \nsector management and are also building blocks for channeling program support to the health sector. They will lead \nto more efficient funding of key health sector needs, including to poor and remote provinces.  \n(ii)  The national MNCH strategy will address major impediments to achieving MDGs for reducing maternal, infant, and \nchild mortality. The strategy will be comprehensive and address health system improvements such as financing, \nmanagement, leadership, service delivery, and health workforce as well as demand issues that address efforts to \nenhance individual, family, and community participation.    \n(iii)  Guidelines and terms of reference for personnel, facilities, equipment, and drugs required for provincial and district \nhospitals will help determine the optimum recurrent budget for these facilities, essential for addressing service gaps \nin rural and remote areas. \n(iv)  Guidelines  for  implementation  and  expansion  of  model  health  villages  will  support  the  Government's  priority \nintervention for achieving MDGs for maternal, infant, and child mortality and will particularly address current service \ndelivery gaps in rural, remote, and poor areas. \n(v)  The national human resources for health policy and national skilled birth attendance development plan will address \ndeficiencies in the health sector workforce that are recognized as major impediments to achieving MDG targets.  \n(vi)  The HSDP will support expansion of provincial health equity funds, which directly target health financing to the poor, \nand guarantee financing for MNCH services for poor women and minority ethnic groups.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe Lao PDR lags behind on several nonincome MDGs\u2014life expectancy at birth is low (61 years), child malnutrition is high  \n(30%), and infant mortality (55 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality rates (350 per 100,000 live births) are very high \ncompared with other countries in Southeast Asia. One third of the adult population\u2014and nearly half of all females\u2014cannot \nread  or  write,  and  just  14%  of  the  population  has  completed  primary  schooling.  Diarrhea  continues  to  be  the \nsecond-biggest killer of children and the third-biggest killer of adults in the country. Malaria is the number one ranked cause of \nmortality overall, with 70% of the population at risk. The 2006 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey III reported that 40% of children \nunder age 5 years are moderately and 16% are severely stunted. Almost two in every five children under age 5 years are \nmoderately underweight, and 6% are wasted. Some 37% of women of reproductive age and 41% of children under age 5 \nyears suffer from moderate anemia. Forty-five percent of the children under age 5 years were observed to have vitamin A \ndeficiency.  \n \nWomen are key beneficiaries of the HSDP. About 85% of women give birth at home, according to the 2005 Lao Reproductive \nHealth Survey (footnote). Births assisted by health providers only marginally increased from 17.4% to 18.5% between 2000 \nand 2005. Sixty-three percent of births were assisted by family members or relatives, 12% by traditional birth attendants, and \n3% gave birth alone. There are distinct disparities between urban and rural settings: 51% of the urban population delivered in \nhealth facilities, while most of the rural population gave birth at home (87% with road access and 97% without road access). \nEarly pregnancy is also of concern, with an adolescent birth rate at 76 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201319 years old in 2005. Ten \npercent of married women had their first birth before they were 15 years old, and about 37% had given birth before turning 18. \nEarly pregnancy has severe implications on the health of physically immature girls. While there is awareness on danger signs \nof pregnancy and childbirth (e.g., bleeding, lower back and abdominal pain, and baby\u2019s breech position at the time of \ndelivery), such knowledge is limited only among women who may have had two or more children.  \n \nSmall ethnic groups account for only one third of the country\u2019s population, yet they make up more than half of the poor. A \nfactor for the higher poverty rates among the ethnic groups is their places of residence, which are mainly in mountainous and \nremote areas with limited infrastructure, government access, and economic opportunities. There is a shortage of qualified \nhealth workers at the district hospitals and health centers. In remote areas, health workers face difficulties in communicating \nwith health facility users due to language barriers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                 Appendix 9    61\nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe HSDP was designed following a participatory approach and involved consultations with national, provincial, district, and \nvillage officials; staff members at hospitals and health centers; village residents; development partners; and key informants. \nActivities included (i) visits to program areas to consult with and inform officials; (ii) interviews with villagers and health staff \nmembers; (iii) collection of data at all levels; (iv) resettlement, engineering, and environmental field visits and consultations; \n(v) meetings with development partners; and (vi) a workshop with national and provincial stakeholders to review policy and \ndesign issues.  \n  \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation        Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nWas a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe HSDP design incorporates a number of mechanisms to ensure participation by a wide range of government and \nnongovernment stakeholders. The Gender and Ethnic Group Action Plan includes several measures to ensure that the \nconcerns of ethnic groups and women are represented in the implementation of policy reforms and related investments.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nPromoting gender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR, as reflected in the 1991 Constitution, Lao National \nGrowth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, 6th Socio-Economic Development Plan, and a number of the country\u2019s international \ncommitments. The National Commission for the Advancement of Women was established in 1991 to help ensure women\u2019s \nequal access to basic services and productive resources. The commission is responsible for implementing national strategies \nand reports directly to the Government, while the Lao Women's Union helps implementation on the ground.  \n \nWomen in the Lao PDR remain more vulnerable and deprived than men because of their unequal access to land, food, \neducation, and health care, and their long working hours. While gender roles vary within rural communities, women from ethnic \ngroups tend to be the most disadvantaged. Compared with men, women have far lower average literacy, enrollment, and \ncompletion rates, and education gaps widen at higher levels of schooling. In 2004, girls were 30% less likely to participate in \nupper-secondary education and 40% less likely to participate in tertiary education than boys. Although women own and operate \nmost registered small businesses, they have limited access to market information, technical training, and financial services. \nWomen are key beneficiaries from investments in health care as they are primarily responsible for taking care of daily \nhousehold needs and family health. The choice of health practices, such as the location of births and use of birth attendants \ncontinues to be shaped by culture and tradition, decisions that frequently do not appear to reside with women but with their \nparents and husbands. Early marriages and early child-bearing ages of women also build on such traditions, which have \nsevere implications for the health and well-being of girls whose bodies are not sufficiently developed to withstand pregnancy \nand childbirth. \n  \n2.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is \naiming to address gender and ethnic group opportunities and concerns in all MOH-associated \nservices,  programs,  and  projects.  As  part  of  its  planned  restructuring  in  2010,  MOH  is \nconsidering establishing a gender unit for this purpose. It has established a gender committee, \nchaired by a vice minister and including representatives of its departments.  \n \n2.  A  gender  and  ethnic  group  action  plan  has  been  developed  for  the  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Program (the HSDP) to integrate equity concerns in all program activities and to \nensure that women and ethnic groups have equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from \nthe HSDP. The plan is in accordance with current laws, policies, and regulations of the Lao PDR \nand the Policy on Gender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (the  HSDP)  will  be  implemented  by  the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) as a sector development \nprogram including a Program and a Project. It will feature a comprehensive set of policy actions \nthat will address key constraints in access to health care services in the country, particularly for \nwomen,  children,  and  ethnic  groups.  An  accompanying  project  grant  will  finance  a  set  of \ninvestments directly linked with and supportive of the implementation of the policy actions in the \nMinistry of Health (MOH). The HSDP is designed to support the 6th National Health Sector \n1\nDevelopment Plan  through maximizing past investments in the health sector. It will focus on \nprimary health care (PHC) and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) to achieve the \n2\ncountry\u2019s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and will help develop a sector program \napproach to improve overall health service delivery in terms of effectiveness, equity, efficiency, \nand sustainability.  \n \n2.  Civil works covered by output 1 of the Project will involve upgrading four existing district \nhospitals and 20 health centers in the provinces of Luang Prabang, Phongsali, and Xieng \nKhouang.  Although  no  land  acquisitions  were  identified  in  the  assessment  and  no  land \nacquisitions  are  anticipated,  MOH  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  has  prepared  a  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework (LARF), as an expression of its commitment to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) that it will prepare a land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP) in case land acquisition and resettlement issues arise from civil works. The LARF \nprescribes  the  approaches  in  LARP  preparation  and  addresses  the  compensation  and \nresettlement issues under the Project. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Processing Requirements \n \n3.  All civil works have been screened according to their impacts on land acquisition and \nresettlement, and no issues have been identified. However, in case of any change of scope that \nmay involve land acquisition and resettlement, a LARF has been prepared. As per selection \n3\ncriteria  developed  in  the  program  preparatory  technical  assistance,   only  civil  works  with \ninvoluntary resettlement category B and/or category C will be considered in case of a change of \nscope. If resettlement impacts are unavoidable, the EA will submit a short LARP with the LARF \nbefore ADB considers the change of scope.  \n \nC.  Legal and Policy Framework \n \n4.  The legal and policy framework in the LARF are built upon laws currently enforced in the \nLao PDR,  such as Decree No. 192/PM and Regulation No. 2432/STEA, and the relevant \npolicies of ADB, such as the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), its Operations Manual, and \nother related policies. The LARF will govern the LARPs that will be prepared under the Project, \n                                                 \n1   MOH, Government of the Lao PDR. 2006. 6th Health Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010).

Compensation and Entitlement Policies \n \n5.  The overall objective of the EA in defining the compensation and entitlement policy for \nthe Project is to assure ADB that all people affected by the Project will be able to maintain and, \npreferably, improve their pre-program living standards and income-earning capacity through \ncompensation for the loss of tangible and nontangible assets and provision of other assistance \nand  rehabilitation  measures.  Consistent  with  the  provisions  of  Decree  No.  192/PM  and \nRegulation No. 2432/STEA, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, all persons and entities \nwith or without land certificates and/or land titles are eligible to receive compensation. They will \nbe identified through a census in which the cutoff of eligibility to receive compensation and \nentitlement is the last day of the survey in civil works sites. The categories of affected persons \n(APs) under the Project are (i) legal users, (ii) nonlegal users, (iii) owners of houses and/or \nstructures, and (iv) agricultural and nonagricultural laborers or employees. Their compensation \nand entitlement are described in Table A11. \n \nTable A11: Entitlement Matrix \n \n  Type of       \nNo.  Loss/Impacts  Application  Eligible Persons  Compensation and Entitlements \n1  Permanent  Residential  Legal users of  With sufficient remaining land to rebuild \nloss of land  land  residential lands  houses or structures: (i) cash compensation at \n(including  land  replacement cost at current market prices for \nagricultural  land of similar type within the district; and (ii) \nand  civil works contractor to improve remaining \ncommercial  land, e.g., land filling and leveling, at no cost \nland)  to APs to rebuild their houses or structures. \n \nWithout sufficient remaining lands to rebuild \nhouses or structures, either (i) replacement \nland of equal size and category at locations \nwithin the area satisfactory to APs with \nregistered titles or secured tenure; or (ii) cash \ncompensation at replacement cost equal to \ncurrent prices for land of similar category \nnearby, plus assistance to purchase and \nregister the land. \n \nWhere remaining land is not viable to rebuild \nhouses or structures, APs may request the \nProject to acquire the entire landholdings. \n \nAll transaction fees, taxes, and other costs \nassociated with replacement land and/or \nissuance of title or secured tenure will be paid \nfor by the Project. If the head of household is \nmarried, the title will be issued and registered \nin the names of both spouses. \n \n      Nonlegal users  APs will not receive compensation for affected \nland. \n \nIf they have no other residential landholdings, \nthey will be allocated replacement lands with \nleasehold tenure to rebuild their houses. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11    69\n  Type of       \nNo.  Loss/Impacts  Application  Eligible Persons  Compensation and Entitlements \n    Agricultural  Owner  Replacement agricultural land of similar \nland  productivity or cash compensation at \nreplacement cost equal to current prices for \nland of similar category nearby, plus \nassistance to purchase and register the land. \n \nWhere remaining agricultural land is not viable \nfor agricultural purposes, APs may request the \nProject to acquire the entire landholdings. \n \nAll transaction fees, taxes, and other costs \nassociated with replacement land and/or \nissuance of title or secured tenure will be paid \nfor by the Project.

Gender Impact and Mitigating Measures \n \n6.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), the HSDP will pay \nparticular attention to women ensuring that, in case of any land acquisition or resettlement, they \nare (i) entitled to receive compensation for their affected land, structures, and trees; (ii) clearly \nlisted  as  household  heads  to  be  provided  with  allowances  for  transition  and  subsistence, \ntransport, and supplementary allowance for being vulnerable as the result of land acquisition; \nand (iii) extended other form of assistance during relocation. One of their household members \nwill also be given preference for employment in civil works. Specific action plans for women will \nbe incorporated in the LARP. \n ", "Appendix 11    71\nF.  Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups \n \n7.  Certain social groups that may be less able to restore their living conditions, livelihoods, \nand income levels will be identified under the Project. The EA will commit for special attention to \nindigenous  peoples  and  vulnerable  groups  like  the  landless,  poor,  households  headed  by \nwomen, disabled, elderly, or children without means of support. The specific action plans for \nindigenous people and vulnerable groups will be defined in the LARP.  \n \nG.  Public Participation and Documents Disclosure \n \n8.  The HSDP is designed to encourage participatory approaches that involve information \nexchange and decision making in the LARP preparation process. The objective of information \nexchange is to allay the fears of APs about what may happen once the HSDP is implemented. \nThe objectives of consultation are to (i) obtain some details that could be overlooked during \nLARP  preparation,  (ii)  formulate  resettlement  options  that  balance  the  APs\u2019  needs  and \ncapabilities with technical requirements of the subproject, and (iii) help avoid unnecessary and \ncostly subproject development delay. A primer on the LARP translated into Lao will be furnished \nto host districts and villages as well as to APs and stakeholders. MOH will endorse the full \nEnglish version of the LARP to ADB for approval and for posting on the ADB website.   \n \nH.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n \n9.  Communications with APs under the Project will be designated to the national project \ncoordination unit (PCU) that will be created for implementing the HSDP. It will ensure that APs \nare aware of the procedures in filing complaints or grievances that may arise during LARP \nimplementation. A primer on the grievance and redress mechanism and appeals process will be \ndisseminated to APs during the detailed measurement survey. The PCU will assign a desk unit \nto  receive  complaints  from  the  APs  or  stakeholders.  The  resettlement  committees  at  the \nprovinces,  districts,  and  village  committees  will  also  serve  as  the  grievance  and  redress \ncommittees  in  each  level.  There  are  five  procedural  steps  for  the  filing  and  resolution  of \ngrievance and complaints by APs, beginning from the village and district to the province and \nunit. The last resort of appeal by the AP is the court of law that will render the final decision. \n \nI.  Management  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  Preparation  and \nImplementation \n \n10.  The  LARF  defines  five  areas  of  management  concerns  in  LARP  preparation  and \nimplementation. On the implementation arrangement, MOH will be on top of decision making. It \nwill create the PCU for the direct supervision and coordination with the resettlement committees \nin the provinces, districts, and village committees, for the preparation, review, and approval \ntoward implementation as well as internal monitoring and evaluation of LARPs. The training and \norientation aspect will cover the orientation and workshops for the preparation stage and the \nimplementation stage of LARP. In both stages, the PCU will conduct orientation and workshops \nfor all parties involved.  \n \n11.  The voluntary donation of land is not ruled out in the HSDP, but in such a situation, the \nPCU  will  adopt  the  conditions  and  procedures  for  voluntary  contributions  that  have  been \nestablished in other projects in the Lao PDR, and will follow the process in accordance with the \nADB  Operations  Manual  (footnote  3)  and  Prime  Ministerial  Decree  No.  192/PM  (2005). \nDatabase management concerning information on all APs will be the responsibility of the PCU. \nAll data on APs will be computerized. On the review, endorsement and approval of LARP, the \nPCU  will  incorporate  comments  of  APs.  The  PCU  will  submit  the  LARP  to  the  provincial \n ", "72   Appendix 11 \nresettlement  committee  in  English  and  Lao,  and  then  endorse  to  Water  Resources  and \nEnvironment Agency, for approval. The Water Resources and Environment Agency-approved \nLARP will then be disclosed to the affected community and stakeholders, and submitted finally \nto ADB. ADB will place it on its website for downloading by the public. \n \nJ.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n12.  The  LARP  will  have  a  section  that  details  the  resettlement  budget  and  financing \narrangements. The budget will include the compensation at replacement cost, other allowances \nand assistance to APs, cost of replacement cost survey, administration costs, monitoring and \nreporting, and contingency allowance for unforeseen expenses and for cushioning the effect of \ninflation during LARP implementation. The cost of the LARP will be borne by the provincial \nauthorities. MOH will approve the budget for LARP and request the provinces for the release of \nfunds to the unit that will manage the compensation payments to the APs.    \n \nK.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  The primary objective of monitoring is to identify as early as possible the activities \nachieved and the cause(s) of constraints so that arrangements in LARP implementation can be \nadjusted.  Under  the  Project,  the  PCU  will  use  two  mechanisms  for  monitoring  the  LARP \nimplementation: (i) internal monitoring in collaboration with provincial and district health offices \nand village health committees, and (ii) external monitoring by an independent third party.   \n \n14.  The PCU will routinely perform internal monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement \nwith results reported to ADB on quarterly basis. Related information will be collected from the \nfield and reported monthly to the PCU program director to assess the progress and results of \nimplementation,  and  adjust  the  work  program.  Internal  monitoring  will  apply  the  following \napproaches: (i) review of detailed measurement survey on all APs, (ii) consultation and informal \ninterviews with APs, (iii) in-depth case studies, (iv) sample survey of APs, (v) key informant \ninterviews, and (vi) public meetings with people in the community hosting the civil works.  \n \n15.  The independent third party that will be hired by MOH in consultation with ADB at the \nearly stage of LARP implementation will (i) verify internal reports with APs as to the payments of \ncompensation  and  entitlements,  including  the  levels  and  timing  of  the  compensation;  (ii) \ninterview  a  random  sample  of  APs  to  assess  their  knowledge  and  concerns  about  the \nresettlement process; (iii) observe the functioning of the resettlement operation at all levels; (iv) \nverify the nature of grievance issues and the functioning of the grievance redress mechanism; \n(v) survey the standards of living of APs and those in the unaffected portion nearest the civil \nworks  sites  before  and  after  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  to  assess  the  effects  of \nresettlement to APs; and (vi) advise the EA and PCU regarding the possible improvements in \nLARP implementation. Substantial compliance on LARP implementation by MOH will justify its \nrequest to ADB for no objection on the award of the contract for civil works. \n ", "  Appendix 12   73\nSUMMARY INTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The summary initial environmental examination (IEE) is based on the IEE prepared for \nthe Health Sector Development Program (the HSDP). The IEE (Supplementary Appendix C) \nexamined the potential environmental impacts of the HSDP and identified mitigation measures \nto  avoid  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  to  maximize  beneficial  impacts.  Individual \nsubprojects have been categorized as environmental category B (nonsensitive) in view of their \noverall sector implications, in accordance with the Environment Policy (2002) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the relevant portion of the Operations Manual.1 Environmental \nimplications of the policy reforms were also reviewed and are summarized in this summary IEE. \nSince no significant impacts are predicted from those reforms, the IEE focused on the HSDP\u2019s \ninvestment component. This summary IEE has been prepared to comply with ADB guidelines \nfor sector development programs.  \n \n2.  The IEE was prepared for the proposed improvement of four district hospitals and 20 \nhealth centers in the northern provinces of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \naccording to \n(i)   ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003);  \n(ii)   the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s Environmental Protection Law (1999) and its \nImplementing Decree (2002); \n(iii)  the Government's Regulation on Environmental Assessment (2000) and Decree \nNo. 1706 on Health Facility Waste Management signed by the Ministry of Health \non 20 July 2004;  \n(iv)  health  care  waste  management  guidelines  developed  by  the  World  Health \nOrganization, adopted by the Government and translated into Lao; and  \n(v)  the draft national integrated health care waste management plan, prepared by \nMinistry of Health (MOH) and consultants. \n \n3.  Consultations were conducted with concerned agencies and persons knowledgeable \nabout the local health sector. The chief of the Environment Health Division, Department of \nHygiene and Prevention, MOH, is the focal point and is responsible for health care waste \nmanagement in MOH. It was disclosed that MOH is preparing a plan to roll out a solid waste \nmanagement program in all health facilities. MOH is proposing that the HSDP support this by \nensuring  that  all construction  under  the  HSDP  is  implemented  in  line  with  its  solid  waste \nmanagement program, and if possible, also by supporting general capacity building in the \nsector. Potential grant assistance for technical support was also identified. However, this solid \nwaste management program still needs MOH endorsement.  \n \n4.  Site surveys, assessment visits, and public consultations were conducted in the four \nidentified  hospitals  and  a  sample  of  health  centers.  The  health  center  sample  was \nrepresentative of environmental conditions for the other health centers to be renovated or \nupgraded under the HSDP. Rapid environmental assessment checklists in accordance with \nADB guidelines were accomplished during the initial site visits. A situation analysis of the \nproposed upgrading of facilities was prepared; data were gathered from physical inspection of \nthe facilities; and interviews with health care personnel, community members, and the public \nliving in the vicinity of the facilities were conducted.   \n \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2008.

The Project will improve health facilities of four district hospitals and 20 health centers in \nfour provinces (Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, Phongsali, and Xieng Khouang), as shown in Table \nA12.1. In these construction sites, in addition to the proposed improvements, investments will \nbe made as needed for adequate and safe water, sanitation, and medical waste management \nsystems, including appropriate wastewater systems. The Project will also provide equipment \nrequired for maternal, newborn, and child care in district hospitals and health centers, mainly in \nthe eight northern provinces in line with the sector approach and based on needs and sources \nof funding.  \n \nTable A12.1: Civil Works and Equipment Components \n \n      No. of Health  No. of Health \n  District Hospital  Centers   Centers \nProvince  Civil Works  (upgrading)  (replacement) \nCivil Works \nDistrict Hospital Type A     Nambak, Luang Prabang Province      \nDistrict Hospital Type B to A    Boun Nua, Phongsali Province      \nDistrict Hospital type B    Viangkham, Luang Prabang Province     \nRenovation  Mok-mai, Xieng khouang Province \nHealth Centers       10  10 \nEquipment \nDistrict Hospitals A  8     \nDistrict Hospitals B  34     \nHealth Centers    140  10 \nNo. = number. \nSource: Ministry of Health  \n \n6.

Estimated total investment of the HSDP is $20.8 million; with an ADB grant of $20 million \nand $0.8 million as counterpart contribution from the Government. The program grant is $10 \nmillion and the project grant is $10.8 million. MOH will be the Executing Agency through the \nDepartment of Planning and Finance, while other MOH departments and provincial health \noffices will be the implementing agencies. The Project will be implemented with the support of a \nproject coordination unit established within MOH and by the provincial health offices. HSDP \napproval is expected in 2009, and implementation is due to start in early 2010. It is to be \nimplemented over a 4-year period, concluding in 2014. \n \nC.  Environmental Description \n \n8.  Most Lao PDR hospitals\u2014and almost all health centers\u2014in the northern provinces are \nlocated  in  low  population-density  areas  across  hilly  and  mountainous  terrain,  which  are \nconnected through a system of winding, paved and unpaved roads. Many of the remote health \ncenters are not accessible by main road connections. Reaching them can take a few hours of \ntravel by footpaths and trails, less with the use of motorbikes. The project district hospitals and \nhealth centers to be upgraded, improved, or replaced are not situated within environmentally \nsensitive areas. None of the district hospitals and health centers proposed for upgrading and \nimprovement is known to be closer than 20 kilometers to the periphery of these areas.  \n \n9.  The districts comprising the service population of the district hospitals and health centers \nrange in population from 12,000 to 65,000, implying a low volume of services. Livelihoods are \npredominantly based on agriculture or forest products, although the manufacturing and services \nsectors  are  growing.  Economic  development  and  population  growth  are  occurring,  with \nconsequently increasing\u2014but still modest\u2014demands on health services and infrastructure.  \n \n10.  Sanitation infrastructure in most districts and villages is basic, but coverage is high. \nHouseholds typically construct pit latrines. In the low- and medium-density conditions that typify \nmost small villages, these are usually appropriate and adequate for the disposal of wastewater \nand household sullage. Septic tanks, where used, are often inadequately designed, constructed, \nor regularly emptied. Public sanitation facilities are rarely installed. \n \n11.  Solid waste generation is currently increasing with economic activity, particularly with \nmore trade in goods packaged in various forms of plastic containers. Some districts have \ncollection systems, but none have appropriate disposal facilities. Collection systems are rarely \nadequate to collect refuse on a regular, thorough basis. Very little recycling and composting of \nsolid waste takes place. The same situation occurs in hospitals and health facilities where \nseparation of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes is commonly practiced, but not followed \nthrough with proper storage, collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal. \n \n12.  The districts and villages are impaired by poor drainage and indiscriminate littering of \nsolid waste. Many district and village roads remain unpaved and dusty, with poor surface \ntreatment and appear not to benefit from a regular repair and maintenance program. The main \nroads are lined with open canals or lined trench drains, which are poorly kept and frequently \nblocked. Blocked drains and puddles provide habitats for insect disease vectors. Data show that \nthe most common diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and hepatitis\u2014related to \npoor-quality drinking water and hygiene\u2014and dengue fever are attributable to the presence of \nstagnant water.  \n \n ", "76   Appendix 12 \nD.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n13.  Positive  impacts  are  expected  to arise  from  the  subproject  improvements  in  health \nfacilities and increased access to health services for women, children, and ethnic groups. The \nupgrading and improvement projects will enhance public health and the quality of health care \nmade available at the district and village service areas. They address priority problems that \nwould otherwise hinder health sector development.   \n \n14.  Some items of potential concern may occur in connection with subproject location and \ndesign, the construction phase, and operation phase. The main environmental concern is solid \nwaste management. This is not so much a result of upgrading, but a preexisting problem that \nmay increase in importance with the increased use of services. The upgrading creates a good \nopportunity  to  address  this  problem,  in  line  with  government  plans.  Other  issues  are  (i) \nwastewater management, (ii) an increased burden on drainage systems due to upgrades of \nservice facilities, and (iii) an increased burden on water supply sources. \n \n15.  As construction will only be concerned with upgrading existing premises, only minor local \nand temporary negative impacts are expected during the construction phase, in particular some \nnoise, dust, deterioration of water quality through sediment laden runoff or improper waste \ndisposal,  and  added  breading  sites  for  mosquitoes.  These  can  be  readily  managed  to \nacceptable levels through implementation of standard construction environmental management \npractices. Occupational health and safety standards must also be followed. \n \n16.  Project design for upgrading of each facility will incorporate (i) improved drainage and \nsanitation  conditions  in  the  hospital  and  health  center  facilities,  (ii)  behavioral  changes  in \nsanitation practices and raised awareness of sanitation and health, (iii) improvements to public \nsanitation facilities and drainage, and (iv) enhanced capacity of hospital and health center staff \nmembers  to  manage  solid  waste  and  sanitation  through  capacity  building  and  supply  of \noperation and maintenance equipment.  \n \n17.  MOH will be advised to implement the establish policies, plans, and procedures, and \nnational integrated health care waste management plan. This plan will establish the standards \nbased on the Lao PDR's current environmental protection law, its implementing rules and \nregulations, and World Health Organization standards in health care waste management. It will \nbe implemented at different levels for provincial, district, and health center applications. Health \ncare waste management will be incorporated into operational manuals for health facilities, and \npersonnel will be regularly trained on the implementation of correct practices.  \n \n18.  Environmental impact and mitigating actions of program policies are summarized in \nTable A12.3. \n \n ", "  Appendix 12   77\nTable A12.3: Environmental Impact and Mitigating Actions of Program Policies \n \nPolicy Measures  Positive/Negative Impacts  Mitigating Measures \nA.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n19.  Typical  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  plans  for  the  pre-construction, \nconstruction,  and  operation  stages  of  the  upgrading  and  improvement  projects have  been \nprepared  and  are  included  in  the  IEE.  During  preparation  of  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  reference  will  be  made  to  the  plans  containing  relevant  site-specific \nmitigation measures for inclusion in the environmental management plan.  \n \n1.  Environmental Responsibility \n \n20.  The  project  coordination  unit  in  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  will  be \nresponsible for the implementation of the environmental safeguards in the HSDP. It will ensure \nadequate consultation with representatives from central-level agencies, including the Water \nResources and Environment Agency as the environmental regulatory agency. It will delegate \nimplementation of policy actions to the Environment Health Division, Department of Hygiene \nand Prevention, as the focal point for improving health care waste management in MOH, and \nprovide this office support for dissemination through workshops, training, and pilots of the new \nMOH standards and guidelines on waste management.  \n \n ", "78   Appendix 12 \n21.  The main environmental responsibility resides in provincial health offices, which are \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  and  preparing  for  IEEs  in  accordance  with  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  prepared  for  the  HSDP.  These  offices  will  also  be \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  during  detailed \ndesign  and  construction,  with  overall  guidance  from  the  project  coordination  unit.  During \noperation, responsibility for environmental management plan implementation rests primarily with \nthe MOH-designated environmental unit to handle sanitation, health care waste management, \nand wastewater management.   \n \n2.  Environmental Management Plan \n \n22.  Main environmental monitoring includes compliance monitoring; community feedback; \nand  health  care  waste,  sanitation,  and  wastewater  management  monitoring.  Compliance \nmonitoring will be conducted during the detailed design and construction phases to ensure that \nmitigation  specified  in  the  environmental  management  plan  is  carried  out.  The  project \ncoordination  unit  will  assist  provincial  health  offices  in  identifying  proper  indicators  and \nundertaking compliance monitoring. Community feedback and monitoring of key environmental \nindicators will be integrated as part of the activities of the project monitoring group that will be \nformed.  \n \n23.  An environmental management budget to cover costs for management and monitoring at \nthe district hospitals and health centers will be established.    \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n24.  The consultations showed a high level of acceptance of the HSDP as it will improve the \nhospitals and health centers' current state and capability for improved efficiency and service \ndelivery,  particularly  to  achieve  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Some  of  the  raised \nenvironmental  concerns  included  the  lack  of  proper  waste  management,  lack  of  adequate \npersonnel for facility operation and maintenance, inadequate water supply at certain times of the \nyear,  internal  drainage  problems  during  rainy  seasons,  and  basic  lack  of  equipment  and \nsupplies. Such concerns will be incorporated in the mitigation and monitoring plans during \nproject design and implementation. \n  \n25.  To ensure that future project activities are conducted in a participatory manner, a range \nof  public  consultation  and  disclosure  activities  will  be  implemented  throughout  project \nimplementation and evaluation using project disclosure requirements.   \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n26.  The project activities implemented under the HSDP are expected to have a range of \nmajor  social  benefits,  particularly  for  mothers,  children,  and  ethnic  groups.  The  Project  is \nexpected to benefit the population of the targeted district hospitals and health centers. It is also \nexpected to support policy reforms on the regulation of the hospitals and health centers with \nrespect to hospital facility and equipment standards, environmental protection, sanitation and \nhygiene  standards,  environmental  regulation  issues  (particularly  on  health  care  waste \nmanagement issues), and quality of health care delivery. Based on the analyses contained in \nIEE, the following recommendations are made. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12   79\n(i)  The IEE concluded that no significant environmental impacts will occur as a \nresult  of  the  activities  under  the  Project.  The  overall  HSDP  classification  of \ncategory B will continue to be monitored during implementation. \n(ii)  To ensure that environmental issues receive an appropriate level of recognition \nand action in its implementation, it is recommended that the grant agreement \nbetween ADB and the Government make specific reference to environmental \nissues and include relevant covenants for action in the said documents.  \n(iii)  Environmental compliance certificates or their equivalent form in the Government \nshould be issued by the Water Resources and Environment Agency before any \ncivil works are contracted for construction. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091019102729+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Sector Development Program and Project Asian Development Fund Grants", "Author": "md2", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "health sector development program, lao pdr health sector development, lao pdr HSDP, lao human resources for health, maternal newborn child health, MNCH lao pdr, adb project 41376", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091111120212+08'00'", "Title": "Health Sector Development Program"}, "author_page": " \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 September.
