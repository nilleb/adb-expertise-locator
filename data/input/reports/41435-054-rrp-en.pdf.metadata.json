The \nreport also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the International \nFund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  project,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the IFAD loan.1   \n \n2. \nOn 8 December 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project \nto address constraints on poverty reduction and smallholder development in Cambodia.2 To date, \nsolid achievements in productive infrastructure and livelihood improvement have been made in \nthe 196 communes of the five project provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong \nThom, Siem Reap, and Tboung Khmum). The additional financing will expand these interventions \nto  271  communes  within  the  original five  provinces  plus  two  additional  provinces  (Battambang \nand  Prey  Veng).  Consistent  with  the  original  project,  the  additional  financing  will  enhance \nagricultural  productivity,  promote  diversification,  and  improve  access  to  markets,  resulting  in \nbetter livelihoods and higher incomes in the project areas. The additional financing will also bring \nthe added benefit of enhanced resilience to disaster and climate risks. The inclusion of women, \nsmallholding farmers, and poor people will remain a priority.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  problems  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  Cambodia  include  low  agricultural \nproductivity, underdeveloped value chains, and deteriorating natural capital and high vulnerability \nto  climate  threats.  For  poor  people  in  particular,  inefficient  use  of  resources,  poor  productive \ninfrastructure, and limited access to rural financial services are major constraints. Thanks partly \nto  ADB\u2019s  support  in  rural  infrastructure,  agricultural  productivity,  and  natural  resources \nmanagement since 1998, the average poverty rate for rural areas in Cambodia has been reduced \nfrom 53% in 2007 to 20% in 2012.4 However, the number of vulnerable people remains high; the \nloss of only $0.30 per day would bring Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate back up to 40%. 5  \n \n4. \nFurthermore,  disasters  including  extreme  climate  events  such  as  floods  and  droughts \nhave  aggravated  adverse  impacts  on  agriculture  and  other  sectors.6 Cambodia  is  consistently \n\n                                                 \n1   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant and Administration of Grants and Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap \nPoverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project. Manila.   \n\n3   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Poverty \n\nReduction and Smallholder Development Project (TA 9167-CAM).  \n\n4   ADB. 2014. Cambodia: Country Poverty Analysis 2014. Manila. \n5  World Bank. 2015. Cambodian Agriculture in Transition: Opportunities and Risks. Washington, DC. \n6  Flooding is a regular phenomenon in Cambodia. In 2000, an estimated 750,618 families were affected by floods, 347 \npeople were killed, with physical damage of $150 million. In 2009, a flood affected 11 provinces and caused damage \nof $132 million. Unprecedented floods were experienced with widespread impact on infrastructure and communities, \nresulting in the death of 250 people, $625 million in damages, and affecting 1.5 million people in 2011. A severe \ndrought was also experienced in the first 5 months of 2016.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nranked  among  the  top  10  countries  most  vulnerable  to  extreme  climate  events.7 With  climate \nchange, these impacts may worsen over time with adverse implications for competitiveness of the \nagriculture sector, and even more so for poor people. This makes it essential to continue to build \non  the  successes  achieved  under  the  original  project  with  enhanced  climate  and  disaster \nresilience through an additional financing.  \n \n5. \nThe  proposed  additional  financing  will  contribute  to  (i)  the  government\u2019s  Rectangular \nStrategy on Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency 2014\u20132018, especially on enhancement \nof  the  agriculture  sector  (diversification,  value  addition,  and  productivity)  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment;  and  (ii)  the  Agricultural  Sector  Strategic  Development  Plan  2014\u20132018.  The \nadditional  financing  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Cambodia  country  partnership  strategy  and \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019.8 \n \n6. \nThe original project. On 8 December 2009, ADB approved an amount of $45.68 million \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia to finance the original project, including a loan of $3.40 million and \na grant of $27.30 million from the Asian Development Fund resources, a loan of $6.69 million and \na grant of $6.69 million financed by IFAD, and a grant of $1.60 million financed by the Government \nof Finland. The project became effective on 31 March 2010 with a closing date of 28 February \n2018. Its outcome is increased agricultural productivity and improved access to markets in 196 \ncommunes  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i) community-driven \ndevelopment  through  a  block  grant,  (ii) enabling  environment  for  increased  agricultural \nproductivity and diversification, and (iii) effective project management. The Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry, and Fisheries and the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development \nSecretariat are the executing agencies of the project.  \n \n7. \nEligibility for additional financing. The original project meets all eligibility criteria of a \nwell-performing project for additional financing, including (i) timely delivery of expected outputs, \nwith 17 out of 19 output targets achieved, including 417 kilometers of laterite roads rehabilitated \nagainst  the target  of  90 kilometers,  and  55,000 hectares  of  land  irrigated  against  the  target  of \n2,500 hectares; 9  (ii) satisfactory implementation progress: as of 17 August 2017, overall project \nimplementation progress was 96% against the elapsed period of 92%, and cumulative contract \nawards were $43.34 million (94.9%) and cumulative disbursements were $43.63 million (95.5%); \n(iii) satisfactory compliance with environmental and social safeguard requirements and on-track \nimplementation of the gender action plan; (iv) successful management of risks; and (v) on-track \nrating in ADB\u2019s project performance rating. The additional financing modality is suitable as it will \nbenefit from the original project\u2019s design and implementation arrangements. The sector modality \nwill also continue to be used, which has proven to be efficient and effective in the original project. \n \n8. \nKey  lessons.  The  original  project  achieved  an  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return \nexceeding  26%. 10  This  success  is  mainly  explained  by  the  innovative  community-driven \ndevelopment  approach.  Other  specific  lessons  include  the  following:  (i)  basic  infrastructure \ninvestment  addressed  immediate  needs  and  achieved  considerable  impact;  however,  in  the \ncontext of climate change, infrastructure needs to become more resilient; (ii) laterite roads are \n\n                                                 \n7   Germanwatch. 2014.

It will also change the original project scope by enhancing climate and \ndisaster  resilience.  The  aggregate  impact  will  be  livelihoods  and  climate  resilience  in  target \ncommunes in seven provinces in the Tonle Sap Basin improved. The aggregate outcome will be \nagricultural  productivity  increased,  climate  and  disaster  resilience  strengthened, and  access to \nmarkets improved in 271 communes in seven provinces in the Tonle Sap Basin.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nOutput 1: Rural productive infrastructure and livelihood improved with capacity in \ndisaster  risk  management  enhanced.  The  additional  financing  will  focus  on  climate-  and \ndisaster-resilient roads and irrigation schemes. It will rehabilitate an additional 450 kilometers of \nroads and upgrade irrigation infrastructure for an additional 6,000 hectares of land to allow for at \nleast two crops per year.15 Infrastructure subprojects will also be registered in the national asset \ninventory  to  ensure  O&M  beyond  the  additional  financing  implementation  period.  The  existing \n1,241  LIGs  will  be  strengthened  and  an  additional  759  LIGs  will  be  established.  An  LIG \nassociation will also be established with financial contribution from LIG members themselves to \nimprove the group sustainability. Further, DRM in target communes will be strengthened through \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n11 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12 ADB.  2014.

With  regard  to  productivity  and  climate \nresilience, training on climate-smart agriculture practices16 will be provided to 200 paddy selling \ngroups,  LIGs  and  market  improvement  groups.17 Production  of  four  climate-resilient  rice  seed \nvarieties will be promoted upon confirmation of market demand. Beyond production, to ensure \ndiversification of agriculture products, the additional financing will also improve value addition for \nboth  rice  and  nonrice  products  such  as  vegetables,  fish  and  chicken  through  (i) establishing \nmultistakeholder value chain platforms by bringing producers, processors and buyers together, \n(ii)  establishing  364  market  improvement  groups,  (iii)  strengthening  103  existing  small-scale \nagribusinesses, and (iv) establishing at least a further 97 agribusinesses.  \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Project  management  strengthened.  The  existing  executing  agencies  will \ncontinue to manage the project. Support in project management will continue for project staff at \nnational,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels.  Consulting  services  and  special  service \nproviders\u2019 support will be extended or recruited as required.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $66.0  million  (Table  1).

Provincial and district support teams will be established \nwith seconded government staff from the respective departments. Commune councils will support \nall activities implemented at the commune level. The provincial teams will liaise with the Provincial \nDepartments  of  Rural  Development  and  the  Provincial  Departments  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology  to  ensure  that  the  respective  departments  are  fully  engaged  in  infrastructure \nplanning, procurement, design approval, asset registration, and O&M. Project management will \ncontinue to be supported by the project implementation consulting firm engaged under the original \nproject to enhance efficiency, using the single source selection method. With the advance actions \nunder way, the additional financing has high procurement readiness. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nThe additional financing will use designs proven to be compatible with local conditions and \ncommunity  capacity  for  O&M.  The  following  additional  refinements  will  be  made  to  ensure \nsustainability, climate change adaptation, and DRR: (i) roads\u2014increase road level to at least 0.5 \nmeters  above  the  maximum  flood  level,  pave  the  road  surface,  and  improve  drainage; \n(ii) irrigation\u2014ensure canal capacity is adequate and the top of canal banks are above maximum \nflood levels, ensure that farmers can drain their fields without resorting to damaging structures, \nand  strengthen  canal  walls  and  erosion  and  scour  protection  for  sluice  gates;  and \n(iii) embankments\u2014use  good  quality  materials  and  improve  compaction  of  materials  during \nconstruction, reduce embankment slopes where possible, and protect slopes.  \n\n20. \nBased  upon  the  commune  investment  plans,  candidate  subprojects  will  be  identified, \nscreened against eligibility criteria, and prioritized. All proposed subprojects will require an initial \nstudy to determine economic viability, climate and disaster resilience measures, and social and \nenvironmental impacts. If the results of the study confirm that all subproject selection criteria are \n\n\f7 \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nmet, the subprojects can proceed. If there is a risk of not meeting any of the requirements, a full \nfeasibility  study  for  the  subproject  will  be  required.  Feasibility  studies  for  two  representative \nsubprojects were carried out during project preparation and subproject viability was confirmed.20 \n \nB. \n \nEconomic and financial analyses were conducted for two representative subprojects. 21 In \n21. \naddition to rural infrastructure improvement, the analysis also considered the positive impact of \nLIGs and value chain support in the subproject area. The economic internal rate of return for the \nirrigation subproject is 19.1%, based on increase in cultivation area, improved yield and crop and \nlivestock diversification, and for the road subproject is 16.7%, based on vehicle operating cost \nsaving, time cost savings, and crop and livestock diversification. The poverty impact ratio for the \nirrigation  subproject  is  27.8%  and  for  the  road  subproject  is  34.2%. The  financial  analysis \nindicates  that  the  two  subprojects  will  augment  farm  income  substantially.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates that the economic viability is robust against downside risks, including investment cost \nand  maintenance  cost  overrun,  reduction  in  project  benefits,  and  project  delay  by  1  year.  The \nadditional financing will allocate 10% of infrastructure budget to cover O&M during the initial years \nwith consultants supporting the organization and training of the communities for O&M. It will also \napply  DRR  measures,  and  register  subprojects  in  the  national  asset  inventory  for  O&M  to  be \nundertaken by the government to extend the economic life of the physical assets.    \n \nC. \n \n22. \nAll procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan and grant \nand by the IFAD loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Project  implementation,  procurement,  and  financial  management  will  be \naligned with the government\u2019s standard operating procedures for externally financed projects. The \nprocurement classification for the additional financing is assessed as moderate risk. Procurement \ncapacity will be strengthened with assistance by procurement and contract administration officers \nat all levels. Most of the procurement for works will be conducted at the provincial level. \n   \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  premitigation  financial \n23. \nmanagement  risk  level  for  the  additional  financing  was  substantial.  An  action  plan  was \nrecommended to ensure that (i) audited financial statements are submitted on time by preparing \nthe draft statements and required information early, and (ii) internal audit reports are submitted \nannually to ADB. The government has increased the number of pre-qualified independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB and is willing to recruit more than one firm to audit ADB funded projects to \nensure that the audited project financial statements that are in accordance with auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB are submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  executing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Subproject Feasibility Studies (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n \n\n\f8 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n25. \nThe  headcount  poverty  index  for the  target  provinces  varies  by  source  of  data,  but the \npoverty level in all of the seven provinces of the additional financing is equal to or higher than the \nnational rural poverty level of 20%. In many villages under the additional financing, the population \nconsists  largely  of  elderly  smallholder  farmers  taking  care  of  their  grandchildren.  Many  of  the \nhouseholds currently classified as no longer being poor are extremely vulnerable, and access to \nimproved livelihoods will improve the health and nutrition status of households and reduce the \nrisk of them falling back into poverty because of medical expenditure.  \n \n26. \nGender  and  development. The  additional financing  is  categorized  as  effective gender \nmainstreaming. It will promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through enhancing \nwomen\u2019s capacity in climate-smart agriculture, entrepreneurship, resilience to climate change and \ndisasters, and access to basic financing. Women will be targeted for employment in construction, \nrehabilitation and O&M of infrastructure. Moreover, women\u2019s meaningful participation in decision-\nmaking positions in the LIGs, market improvement groups, and service teams will be supported. \nA  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  additional  financing,  which  includes  gender \nactions, performance indicators, and targets to promote women\u2019s voice and active participation in \nall project activities. Key gender targets include the following: (i) at least 25% of unskilled workers \nemployed are women, (ii) at least one woman to be elected to each management committee of \nthe  new  LIGs  and  service  teams,  (iii)  at  least  60%  of  rural  loans  are  taken  by  women,  (iv) \ncommune  councilors from  selected  communes receive  gender-responsive  DRM  training,  (v) at \nleast 200 agribusiness enterprises (30% owned by women) are operational, and (vi) at least 40% \nof market improvement group and paddy selling group members are women.  \n \n27. \nGender action plan implementation is on-track under the original project, which showed \nthat women are the main direct beneficiaries of LIG-related activities, and access to rural loans \nand  LIGs  has  been  a  successful  vehicle  for  delivering  financial  resources  and  technology  to \npromote  diversification  of  income-generating  agriculture  activities.  The  following  has  enabled \nwomen to extend their livelihood options and get better incomes to support their family: (i) all LIGs \nhave at least one woman elected to the management committees and 52% of LIG management \ncommittee members  are  women,  (ii)  54%  of LIG  members  are  women,  (iii)  58%  of rural  loans \nwere  taken  by  women,  (iv)  67%  of  participants  in  refresher  training  on  financial  literacy  and \nbusiness plans for LIGs were women, (v) 65% of women LIG members prepared business plans, \nand (vi) 64% of LIG members who participated in training needs assessment were women. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nEnvironment (category B). Proposed development of rural infrastructure and livelihood \nactivities has potential for site-specific adverse construction environmental impacts, including loss \nof boundary vegetation, dust, noise, and disturbance of access and agricultural activities. These \nimpacts can be effectively reduced through appropriate site alignment and design, consideration \nof seasonal constraints, implementation of mitigation measures, and regular maintenance. The \nadditional financing is expected to increase agricultural productivity, which will increase demands \non water and has potential to increase the use of chemical pesticides. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) including an environmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared for \ntwo representative subprojects.22 The IEE includes a detailed water balance and has confirmed \nthat the water sources are sustainable. Training on integrated pest management approaches is \nincluded in the capacity building program. Public consultations were carried out and will continue \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nduring  subproject  implementation.  The  IEE  and  the  EMP  will  serve  as  a  template  for  future \nsubprojects, which are not subject to domestic environmental assessment requirements.   \n \n29. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  has  been  prepared  to  provide \nguidance on processes to be followed for future subproject selection, screening, assessment, and \nimplementation.23 Subprojects classified as category A will not be financed. Adequate resources \nhave been allocated for environmental safeguards assessment, implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting. Consulting services will provide capacity development support for EMP implementation. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a safeguards grievance redress mechanism. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework and the draft IEE were disclosed on the \nADB  website  on  18  June  2017. The final  IEE  will  be  updated  and  disclosed following  detailed \nengineering design. The project is classified as medium climate risk. A climate and disaster risk \nassessment has been prepared and all subprojects will be screened for climate and disaster risks \nand incorporate risk reduction measures.24 The representative subprojects include flood-resilient \ndesign  specifications  such  as  canal  wall  strengthening,  erosion  and  scour  protection for  sluice \ngates, increase in road height, additional drainage structures, and slope stabilization measures.  \n \n30. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). There will be no significant involuntary physical \nor economic dislocation, relocation, or loss of livelihood. Land acquisition will be limited and is \nexpected  to  comprise  (i)  thin  strips  of  land  to  accommodate  irrigation  canal  construction  and \naccess road improvement within irrigation schemes, or (ii) minor road widening to accommodate \nraised profiles and reduced slopes on verges when roads are rehabilitated to incorporate climate \nresilience and DRR measures. These strips of land may be acquired through voluntary donation, \nnegotiated  settlement,  or  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  those  not  willing  to \ndonate land voluntarily. Since no involuntary resettlement is expected in the two representative \nsubprojects,  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  is  required,  although  two  due  diligence \nreports have been prepared. A resettlement framework has been prepared and will be used to (i) \nfurther screen and select subprojects during implementation, rejecting all category A subprojects; \n(ii)  guide  the  preparation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  where  required;  and  (iii) \nconduct and report the due diligence required to establish voluntary land donation bona fides.25 \n\n31. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). An indigenous peoples planning framework has been \nprepared. 26 Only  nine  out  of  the  271  communes  are  inhabited  by  indigenous  peoples.  The \nindigenous peoples will benefit alongside majority communities, but efforts will be made to ensure \ntheir participation. The executing agencies will ensure that all ethnic minority groups in and around \nproposed  subproject  locations  are  (i)  consulted  on  their  willingness  to  participate  and  the \nsuitability of the sites and subproject activities, and (ii) given an equal opportunity to participate in \nsubproject  activities  including  training.  For  the  two  representative  subprojects,  no  indigenous \npeoples are present and no indigenous peoples plan is required. Screening will be conducted for \nall subprojects following procedures set out in the indigenous peoples planning framework, and if \nindigenous peoples are the sole or the overwhelming majority of direct project beneficiaries, and \nwhen only positive impacts are identified, the elements of an indigenous peoples plan could be \nincluded  in  the  overall  subproject  design rather than  in  a  separate  indigenous  peoples  plan. If \nadverse impacts are expected, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisk and Mitigation Measures \n\nF. \n \n32.
