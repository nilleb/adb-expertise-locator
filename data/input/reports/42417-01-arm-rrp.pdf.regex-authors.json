I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for a multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  to  Armenia  to  help  finance  a  share  of  the  Sustainable  Urban \nDevelopment Investment Program.1 The proposed investments are physical and nonphysical in \nnature and target improved urban connectivity and mobility, transport efficiency, reliability and \nsafety and institutional effectiveness.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.   Armenia has a relatively small population (3.24 million), but is the most urbanized country \nin the Caucasus. Urban areas, with 2.1 million people or 64% of the total population, already \naccount for most of the country\u2019s economic activity and employment. Armenian urban areas fall \ninto  four  categories3 (i)  Yerevan,  the  capital  city  with  1.12  million  people;  (ii)  mid-sized \nsecondary cities such as Gyumri, Kapan, and Vanadzor; (iii) small and medium size cities with \nimportant industrial and agro-processing complexes such as Armavir, Artashat, Ashtarak and \nArarat;  and  (iv)  cities  with  high  tourism  potential  such  as  Dilijan,  Jermuk,  Sevan,  and \nTsakhkadzor. These 12 cities account for almost 90% of the nation's gross domestic product, \nwith Yerevan alone accounting for 60%.  \n \n3.   Shifting urban landscape. Unbalanced economic growth among regions, posing serious \ndevelopment challenges to planners and policy makers. Some cities are growing fast, others are \nnot. Some house only one industry at best; others struggle to attract one. Even Yerevan has \nseen change. A gradual collapse of its heavy industry, in the early 1990s, then located in its \nsouthern ring, created a rapid shift in the location of commercial and residential centers, and \ncorresponding changes in the demand for metro, tramway, trolleybus and bus network services. \nThese changes have increased motorization, but also led to poor air quality, noise, traffic \ncongestion, loss of green areas, and degraded historical buildings. Many secondary cities have \nalso grown since the 1990s and now share most of Yerevan\u2019s problems.4  \n \n4.   Traffic and road safety concerns. Growth has brought widespread vehicle ownership, \nwhich has grown by 40% since 2004.5 The number of accidents in Yerevan has risen in parallel, \nfrom 260 fatalities in 2004 to more than 400 in 2008, with the number of injured more than \ndoubling from 1,500 in 2004 to 3,125 in 2008. This has put road safety on the agenda. Despite \nimprovements  in  major  arteries  in  the  capital,  the  traffic  signal  system  is  outdated  and \ninadequate. Environmental protection is now another priority. Located in Ararat Valley, Yerevan \nhas little natural ventilation, and congestion results in concentration of hazardous substances. \nUrban transport generated 90% of air pollution in 2009, with carbon dioxide emissions expected \nto increase by 160% by 2020. The limited number of bridges in Yerevan over the Hrazdan River \ncreates bottlenecks and massive congestion during peak hours. In addition, a city bypass \nremains uncompleted, disallowing any diversion of passing traffic. Illegal and double parking \nand poorly enforced traffic laws further constrain mobility. In 2009, traffic exceeded design \n                                                 \n1  See the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical \nAssistance to Armenia for Preparing the Yerevan Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila (TA 7340-ARM). \n3  ADB. Armenia: Strategic Urban Assessment. Manila. (TA 6423-REG). \n4  See Sector Assessment and Roadmap Summary: Urban Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n5  With 130,000 vehicles registered in 2009, Yerevan accounts for 40% of vehicles nationally. ", "2 \ncapacity on more than 20% of the road network, and a further 35% was about to reach its limit. \nMost of these problems are replicated in other cities.  \n \n5.   Inadequate public transport services. The Yerevan public transport system comprises \nmicrobuses, buses, trolleybuses, and metro routes.6 Its public transport infrastructure is aged, \nand vehicle fleet old and poorly maintained, travelling an average speed of 16 kilometers per \nhour. The metro network has a single 12.1 km line with 10 stations and a fleet of 70 old \ncarriages. Metro ridership accounts for only 8.2% of total public transport ridership, which stood \nat  207  million  passenger  trips  in  2009.  Today,  85%  of  the  passengers  are  carried  by \nunsubsidized  private  microbuses,  despite  their  expensive  fares.7 While  minibuses  spared \nYerevan a severe transport crisis in the 1990s, they now contribute to a chaotic situation that \nhas seen big and medium-sized buses pushed out. Service quality is poor due to overloading \nand congestion. This shift has severely compromised the financial sustainability of other public \ntransport services and caused investment backlogs for trolleybus and metro, as fares are too \nlow to cover operating and renewal costs. In other Armenian cities, the urban transport issues \nare similar albeit less dire. They have deteriorating urban road networks with inefficient or \nnonexistent systems of traffic management and poor public transport that relies far too heavily \non microbuses. The transport network needs restructuring, as routes often duplicate others. \nService quality is poor and the level of comfort minimal. In tourist centers, urban transport \ninfrastructure  is  unable  to  cope  with  the  inflows  at  peak  periods.  These  limitations  are \naccompanied by rising gaps in the quality of municipal planning, finance and monitoring.  \n \n6.   Sector  strategy,  roadmap,  and  institutional  reform. The national government and \nYerevan municipality have invested more than $185 million during 2005-2010 in upgrading \nurban infrastructure. But these investments are only patching up immediate problems. More \ninvestments are needed to make the system viable. Secondary cities are in a similar situation. A \nstrategic  framework  for  urban  renewal  has  been  agreed  to  correct  this,  and  to  adopt  a \nsystematic approach. This is backed by a roadmap, policy framework and investment plan split \ninto  shorter  (immediate),  medium  (2011-2016)  and  long  term  (2017-2025)  interventions, \ncovering both physical and non physical requirements. The overall investment runs into $960 \nmillion for the period 2011 to 2025 -an average capital and recurrent expenditure outlay of \naround $70 million a year.  \n \n  Table 1: Long term Sector Investment Program \n($ million) \nItem  Short  Medium  Long  Total  Share of \nTerm  Term  Term  Total (%) \n1.

For clarity, figures have been rounded.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n7.   Rationale  for  using  the  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  The  government  has \nrequested Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance via an MFF. The strategic approach for \nurban renewal is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Armenia8 and in line \n                                                 \n6  The system includes 2,800 microbuses operated by 65 companies on 118 microbus routes, 390 buses running on \n28 bus routes, and 50 trolleybuses running on 9 trolleybus routes. \n7  Twice as high as the municipal-owned operators. \n8  ADB.  2006.  Economic  Report  and  Interim  Operational  Strategy:  Armenia  (2006\u20132009).  Manila.  A  country \npartnership strategy is under preparation. \n ", "3 \nwith ADB\u2019s own sustainable transport initiative and Strategy 2020.9 The existence of a strategy, \nroadmap, policy framework, investment program, and a financing plan justifies the use of the \nMFF in this case. The majority of the investments are similar in size and fairly repetitive over \ntime. This means that the tranches do not involve very small investments at the start followed by \nlarge and complex ones later. The size of these investments is nonetheless larger than the one \nnormally identified with a sector loan modality. The sequence and location of these investments \nis also highly predictable. This means the MFF can be used within the stipulated period, thus \nlimiting the timing of the so-called \u201cmoral financing obligation\u201d. A large stand-alone loan would \nresult in high commitment fees to the client. The MFF is also more flexible with regard to \nindividual tranche financing plans. Some tranches are expected to be co-financed with donors \nand the private sector. The policy reform framework is already in place. This cuts out the \ndevelopment program loan approach. Finally, the MFF blends more easily physical investments \nwith institutional change. It can also accommodate policy revisions. The modality is thus cost \neffective and provides a better basis for a longer term partnership in the sector.  \n \n8.   Coordination with development partner and civil society organizations. ADB has \nconsulted key partners working in Armenia. It also consulted civil society organizations and the \nprivate sector. This coordination will continue during the implementation phase, including under \neach tranche of the MFF. Further, ADB chairs a partner coordinating committee covering urban \ntransport and other urban services. This will be invoked from time to time as needed. There is a \nbasic understanding among the partners and key civil society organizations on the investment \npriorities, institutional change and policy reforms required to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. \nADB has been involved in urban water supply in the country since 2007,10 but this will be the \nfirst time it will do so in the urban transport area. Other donors are already active, namely the \nWorld Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  The World \nBank  is  currently  discussing  with  authorities  a  $30  million  loan  for  parking  and  traffic \nmanagement. EBRD is working with the Yerevan municipality and the metro company.  The city \nalso  signed  in  early  2010  a  \u20ac15 million  loan  cofinanced  by  the  European  Union  and  the \nEuropean Investment Bank. EBRD and ADB are jointly financing the renovation of Yerevan \nZvartnots International Airport, a transaction led by the Private Sector Operations Department.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.   The impact of the MFF will be an improved urban environment, a stronger economy, \nspearheaded  by  investments  in  cities  and  job  creation,  and  enhanced  private  sector \nparticipation in urban areas. The outcome will be improved urban transport infrastructure in 12 \nArmenian cities, leading to more efficient, reliable, safer and affordable services (Appendix 1). \n  \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The MFF will support physical investments; greater institutional effectiveness; and project \nmanagement as outlined in Table 2 below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB, 2009.

Investment and Financing Plans  \n11.  The government has requested an MFF of up to $400 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources  (ADF)  and  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  to  help  finance  a  portion  of  the \ninvestment program.

Up to five tranches are envisaged under the MFF, each amounting to between $50 million \nand  $100  million.  Project  readiness,  demonstrated  through  completion  of  design  works, \nadvanced bidding and contract awards, will be a pre-requisite for the approval of each tranche.  \nEach tranche will also require all safeguard plans to have been executed upfront and fully, in \nline with ADB policies and procedures. Funding for much of this work will be set aside under the \nfirst tranche, supplemented as needed in each of the preceding tranches.

The present indicative ADB financing for the MFF comprises $180 million in the form of \nADF resources and $220 million in OCR. The government has requested flexibility in the use of \nADF  resources  for  subsequent  tranches.  It  is  understood  that  the  provision  of  any  such \nadditional ADF financing will be accompanied by a corresponding reduction of the available \nOCR financing (and vice-versa), so that in any event the total financing provided by ADB will not \nexceed the MFF amount of $400 million equivalent. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject \nto (i) the general availability of ADF resources from time to time, (ii) Armenia\u2019s access to such \nresources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then-applicable Graduation Policy13 and the requirements of ADF \ndonors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Armenia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then-applicable \npolicy on performance-based allocation of ADF resources.14 OCR loans will have a term of up to \n25 years, including a grace period of up to 5 years, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements for each tranche. The facility \nadministration manual shows the financial arrangements and indicative flow of funds. 15 \n \n14.  Tranche 1, supported with a loan of about $50 million equivalent, focuses mainly on the \nconstruction of the ring road in Yerevan. This 4.5 km road will divert traffic from the city center \nand stimulate economic development in the outer areas of the city. It will be funded from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The government will finance \nabout $12 million, mainly by paying for land acquisition, taxes and duties. The tranche will set \naside  funds  to  prepare  investment  projects  for  secondary  cities including  Gyumri,  Jermuk, \nVanadzor, and Kapan.  ADB will finance resettlement expenses on a case by case basis, \nincluding under tranche 1, but not land acquisition. This action will enhance project readiness. \nThe government requested ADB\u2019s support in this area due to budgetary constraints, but more \nimportantly to accelerate the start of construction and project implementation as a whole. All the \nnecessary administrative arrangements for land acquisition and resettlement are captured in the \n                                                 \n12  Management is currently revising conditions for the use of the MFF.  Issues being tacked include a revised annual \nreport (to better capture performance and utilization), advance information on tranches (prior to their approval) and \nimproved arrangements for linked documents, including safeguards.  This MFF will apply the new conditions once \napproved. \n13  Currently: ADB. 2008. Review of the 1998 Graduation Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n14  Currently: ADB. 2004.

ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  process  to  ensure  full \ncompliance with safeguards requirements.  \n \n15.  Co-financing  and  Private  Sector  Development.  ADB  and  the  government  will  pay \nspecial attention to raising cofinancing from third parties, as well as funded risk participation by \nthe private sector. The MFF will also focus on expanding private sector participation in the \nmanagement  of  transport  and  other  urban  assets.  This  plan  will  require  continuous \nimprovements on legal and regulatory fronts as well as tariff setting and contracting modalities, \nprovisions for which are included in the roadmap. \n   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Investment  program  management.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  will  be  the  executing \nagency, considering the program\u2019s countrywide coverage.16 Yerevan municipality will be the \nimplementing agency for tranche 1.  The Municipality will (i) manage, supervise, monitor day-to-\nday  implementation,  and  organize  procurement;  (ii)  provide  any  counterpart  assistance \nrequired;  and  (iii)  provide  oversight  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. The entire program will be monitored by a government supervisory board.  This is \nto ensure full support from relevant ministries, municipalities and other agencies. The concerned \ncity  municipalities  will  implement  subsequent  tranches.  Implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 5 and detailed in the facility administration manual. \n \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2011\u2013March 2020 (with completion estimated by 31 December 2020)\nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Supervisory Board chaired by Prime Minister \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Economy \n(iii) Implementing  Yerevan Municipality, and other implementing agencies to be designated by the \nagencies  Supervisory board for subsequent tranches \n(iv) Implementation unit  Existing Yerevan Development PIU for tranche 1 with Project Management consultant  \nProcurement a  International competitive bidding for civil works  4 contracts  $350 million \nInternational competitive bidding for goods   1 contract  $30 million \nConsulting services b  Overall project management (Procurement  1 contract; quality- and  $14 million \nsafeguards, overall supervision and expertise)   cost-based selection \n(QCBS) \nEngineering and construction supervision  3 contracts (QCBS)  $23 million \nconsultants (firm) \nAudit and advisory services  50 person-months  $2 million \n(individual and firm) \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing is available for up to about $10 million (20% of tranche 1 loan) on \nand/or advance  advance contracts for eligible expenditures (civil works, goods, and consulting services). \ncontracting \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between \nthe government and ADB. \na  Tentative amounts and packages referring to the proposed procurement plan.

Financial management. A financial management assessment and procurement capacity \nassessment confirmed that Yerevan municipality can deal with the implementation of tranche 1, \ngiven its past experience in administering donor projects. Other cities do not yet have such \ncapacity. The MFF will finance training on ADB procedures for them including on safeguards, \nprocurement,  contract  management,  loan  disbursement  and  monitoring.  These  tasks  are \nalready planed in 2011. The Armenia Resident Mission will be closely involved in implementing \nthe entire MFF under the joint venture arrangement practiced in the department responsible for \nthe region - Central and West Asia Department. While the Resident Mission will continuously \nreview MFF implementation, at least three formal loan review missions will be fielded every year \nwith the participation of headquarters staff. Annual independent audits will be undertaken. \nDonors and civil society organizations will be briefed and consulted with regularly. Co-financing \nwill be sought for each tranche. \n \n18.  Contracting  Arrangements: Contracting arrangements will be continuously reviewed, \nrefined and revised to achieve maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. Key features include: \n(i) Management: A firm will be recruited as a program manager to support, guide and manage \nthe implementation of the whole MFF with the implementing agency and existing PIU. It will \nsupport all aspects of MFF management, procurement, safeguards compliance, and oversight \non  the  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  Engineering  and  Supervision:  3  engineering  and \nsupervision contracts will be issued matching the different type of outputs (road, public transport \nand urban regeneration); (iii) Civil Works: 4 contracts are planned, including one for Yerevan \nbypass; one contract for the construction of urban roads and missing links in the secondary \ncities, one contract for public transport including metro and other public modes, and one for \nurban regeneration in Yerevan and secondary cities; (iv) Audit: A firm will be recruited to \nundertake independent financial and operational audit; (v) Goods: one contract will be issued \nfor equipments for the metro extension in Yerevan. Continuous consultations with the private \nsector and market surveys will be undertaken prior to each tranche. Subject to market feedback, \nsome of the civil works contracts will be designed on a turnkey basis comprising design as well \nas execution. A detailed procurement plan has been prepared for the first tranche, and tender \ndocuments are ready. \n \n19.  As the current metro system in Yerevan uses technology and equipment from the former \nSoviet Union, the government has requested a waiver to allow the procurement of some metro \nequipment from nonmember countries to ensure continuity and passenger safety.17 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  A comprehensive sector strategy and roadmap for urban transport renewal have been \nprepared.  This  will  be  updated  during  the  MFF  implementation.  Technical  due  diligence, \nincluding preliminary designs, has been completed for the two subprojects included in tranche 1. \nFuture tranches will be approved only after preliminary or full designs are available. \n \n                                                 \n17 The existing metro network was built following the Soviet metro system and Soviet standards. Technical due \ndiligence has shown that some critical components of the signaling and energy system will need to be procured \nfrom nonmember countries to ensure continuity with existing metro equipment and guarantee proper passenger \nsafety in the tunnel and on trains. The metro company has traditionally imported such items from nonmember \ncountries. The value of nonmember procurement is estimated at less than 15% of the total MFF and will happen in \ntranche 2 and in subsequent tranches. It will be detailed in the facility administration manual before each periodic \nfinancing request. ADB member countries may propose alternative technology, but switching technologies would \nbe too costly. All other components will be procured from ADB member countries. \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The major economic benefits accruing from projects will be savings in travel time and \nvehicle operating cost per kilometer, and fewer traffic accidents.18 The analysis showed that the \ntwo subprojects are economically viable, with internal rates of return (EIRRs) of 14.4%\u201320.3% \nand estimated economic net present values of $4.8 million\u2013$17.2 million at a 12% discount rate. \nA sensitivity analysis confirmed this viability. A risk analysis indicated that the mean and median \nEIRRs, though lower than the base case EIRRs, were above 12%. In tranche 1, no revenue-\ngenerating  projects  will  be  implemented,  so  no  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken. \nEconomic and financial analysis will be conducted for all future projects under the MFF. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  A financial management assessment was conducted for Yerevan municipality, a process \nthat will be replicated for all other cities during MFF implementation. The Yerevan municipality \nhas adequate capacity to manage the investment program and project implementation. The \nprocurement assessment has demonstrated adequate capacity and systems to procure goods \nand  services  through  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  according  to  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  Yerevan  municipality.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures on governance are described in the Facility Administration Manual.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The investments will have a direct and indirect poverty impact on people across the \ncountry. Tranche 1 investment on the Yerevan ring road will benefit 1.14 million people (34% of \nArmenia\u2019s population and 54% of its urban population). The investment will improve living \nconditions, the urban environment and mobility. Potential beneficiaries are local residents, road \nand public transport users (including students), and businesses, who will benefit from greater \nmobility and connectivity. Tranche 1 will generate an estimated 400 jobs. Employment targets for \nlocal unskilled workers, women, and vulnerable groups are included in the summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy.19 The MFF as a whole will directly benefit over 2.1 million urban \nresidents (64% of the Armenian population). By 2025, the poor will benefit through (i) better \naccess to the city and other activity centers, (ii) affordable transport alternatives for travelling in \nthe city, (iii) better living conditions and pollution reduction, (iv) employment opportunities in the \nconstruction and maintenance of road projects (more than 1,000 jobs), and (v) improved job \nprospects in all cities. Tariff and subsidy reform and an integrated ticketing system allowing \nsocial and concessionary fares for the microbus system will guarantee wide mobility for the \npoor.  Road  construction  will  sustain  socioeconomic  development  and  promote  tourism  in \nYerevan, Jermuk, Dilijan, Tsakhkadzor and Sevan. \n  \n24.  Health. Health hazards from automotive pollution and traffic accidents will be reduced. \nCO2 emissions will be reduced. Reduced congestion, noise, and exhaust fumes, and expanded \ngreen and pedestrian areas will improve public health and the quality of life. Shorter travel time \nand better transport services will improve lives\u2014especially for women, the elderly, and children\u2014\nas improved road and public transport will ease access to social services such as universities, \nhospitals, and clinics. Awareness training on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections will be \nrequired in civil works bidding documents and monitored during implementation. \n                                                 \n18  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n19  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n25.  Gender impact. The MFF will have some gender benefits. It will improve women\u2019s access \nto  transport  services  and  enhance  their  rights  and  benefits.  The  gender  action  plan  has \nmeasures for boosting gender awareness; information sharing on HIV/AIDS risk; equal pay; and \nhygiene promotion. It stipulates training for all implementing agencies through gender focal \npoints, and balanced representation in decision making in sector agencies.20 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment. An environmental assessment and review framework for the entire MFF \nwas approved on 24 September 2010. Tranche 1 project is classified as category B, and two \ninitial environmental examinations have been prepared.21 Tranche 1 subprojects will not have \nsignificant irreversible negative environmental impacts during or after construction.22 Yerevan \nmunicipality  will  require  the  contractor  to  implement  the  environmental  management  plan \noutlined in the initial environmental examination and in the framework. The plan will be part of the \nconstruction contract.  With respect to the entire MFF, projects in cities with high tourism potential \nwith national parks or historical heritage sites are tentatively categorized as \u201cA\u201d, while other \nprojects in Yerevan and other cities are categorized as \u201cB\u201d. ADB policies and procedures will be \nfollowed in each case. \n \n27.  Land acquisition and resettlement. To satisfy the requirements of national laws and the \nADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), a land acquisition and resettlement framework for the \nentire  MFF  was  approved  and  disclosed  on  24 September  2010  The  tranche  1  project  is \nclassified as resettlement category A. Both subprojects under tranche 1 involve land acquisition \nfor which two land acquisition and resettlement plans were approved on 24 September 2010.23 \nThe impact of subproject 2 is significant as more than 200 individuals will be relocated; while \nthat of subproject 1 is marginal.  With respect to the subsequent tranches of the MFF, the \nprojects  involving  Yerevan  are  tentatively  classified  as  category  A,  while  those  in  other \nsecondary cities are classified as category B. \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples. The investment program areas do not include communities that \nmay be defined as indigenous peoples under the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nMFF and all tranche subprojects are classified as category C.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The implementation risks are summarized in Table 6.  \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementing agency has limited experience with  Project management consultants will be hired to streamline \nexternal financing.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the MFF shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nFacility Administration Manual and loan documents. The government has given ADB certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific \ncovenants agreed by the government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $400,000,000  equivalent  to  Armenia  for  the  Sustainable  Urban \nDevelopment Investment Program comprising \n \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  then  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special  Funds \nresources, subject to conditions set forth in para. 13 of this report;  \n(ii)  loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n32.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in para. 19 of this report \nthat the metro equipment procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible for financing \nunder the investment program. If the requisite affirmative vote of directors representing not less \nthan two-thirds of the total voting power of ADB\u2019s membership, pursuant to article 14(ix) of the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, is not obtained for this recommendation and the Board approves \nonly  the  recommendation  in  para.  31,  then  only  metro  equipment  procured  from  member \ncountries of ADB will be eligible for financing under the investment program. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n29 March 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nDesign  Data Sources and  Assumptions\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \nSummary  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact \nBy 2022,  Report of multiple Indicators  Assumptions \nImproved \nAir pollution due to urban transport declines by  from municipal departments,  The government \nurban \n5% compared to 90% baseline in 2009.  companies and  pursues optimal \nenvironment, \nnongovernment  growth strategies \nlocal economic  Contribution of secondary cities to gross \norganizations \nconditions and  domestic product increases to at least 35%  Appropriate \ngreater private  (baseline 2009: 30%)  Statistical surveys (Ministry  environmental \nsector within  Private investment in urban transport sector in  of Natural Protection,  framework in place \nurban areas  Armenia increases at least by 10% compared  Ministry of Transport and  Political and \nTelecommunications, \nto 2009  economic stability. \nYerevan municipality, \nAccidents decline by at least 10%  (baseline  Yerevantrans or other  Risk \n2008: 407 fatalities and 3,125 injured)  agencies)  Economy\u2019s \nGovernment operational subsidy for public  vulnerability to \ntransport declines by at least 10% compared  exogenous shocks. \nto 64% in 2009 \nOutcome \nBy 2020,  Nongovernment  Assumptions \nEfficient, \nTravel time from South to North Yerevan  organization, international  Political will for \nreliable and \ndeclines by 40% compared to 45 minutes in  and national transport  efficient Program \naffordable \n2009  associations repost and  implementation \nurban \ndatabase \ninfrastructure  National public transport modal split is  Prompt decision-\nand services  maintained at 21% (2008)  Metro and trolleybus  making and \nprovided in  Share of women using urban transport  companies, Yerevan Trans  counterpart funds \nArmenian  services increases by at least 5% from 8.3  Municipality transport  release \ncities  million in 2008 because of better security  statistics or other agencies  Risks \nas appropriate   Political debate \nAt least 1,000 new jobs are created due to \nshifting urban \nconstruction  Statistical Yearbook of \ntransport focus \nArmenia  \nSlowdown of \nbusiness \nenvironment  \nundermined private \nsector appetite \nOutputs  By 2016:  Project progress reports  Assumptions \nUrban \nCompletion of urban infrastructure:  Yerevan municipality \ninfrastructure  Yerevan urban transport \n-5.3 km of road links constructed by Yerevan  and other \nextended,  master plan published \nmunicipality;
