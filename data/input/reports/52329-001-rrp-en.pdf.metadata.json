ADB\u2019s  14  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  share  similar \n3. \ndevelopment challenges, \nremoteness, \nsusceptibility  to natural  disasters,  and  vulnerability  to  external  shocks.  They  are  currently \nembarking on a structural transition from power generation  based on fossil fuels to generation \nfrom renewable energy sources, so as to lower power generation costs, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and improve energy security. However, given the small size of their economies and \npower utilities, the PDMCs face unique capacity constraints. The lack of technical capacity of the \npower utilities in the renewable energy segment limits the internal skills available to manage grids \nthat are moving rapidly from relatively simple single-source generation systems (diesel) to grids \nwith multiple intermittent renewable energy sources (wind, solar, and hydropower). This requires \nmore sophisticated integration systems and stronger technical expertise. Moreover, the structural \nshift  entails  significant  investment.  Commercial  and  public  sector  funding  for  power  utilities  is \ninadequate.  Private  sector  investment  in  owning  and  operating  intermittent  renewable  energy \ngeneration facilities is crucial to supplementing local capacity and filling the investment gap in the \nsector. Most PMDCs are now actively seeking investments from independent power producers \n(IPPs).1  \n\n4. \nBarriers. Private sector investment in renewable energy in the Pacific region is currently \nrestricted  by   [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION DELETED]  (ii)  lack  of  bankability  of  PPAs,  (iii) \nuncertainties over foreign currency availability and convertibility, (iii) political  risks, and (iv) low \ncapacity of governments and utilities for engaging the market and preparing bankable PPAs. The \nprivate sector relies on sovereign guarantees to backstop the offtake obligations of power utilities. \nHowever, many PDMCs are unable to provide guarantees for the following reasons: \n \n\nGovernments are reluctant to provide guarantees  because the obligation will be \ncounted as a contingent liability and will contribute to national debt. \nOften, PDMCs do not have any headroom within their mandated debt ceilings or \nwould prefer to utilize available headroom for direct borrowing. \nThe  small  scale  of  many  transactions  means  that  the  transaction  costs  for \nestablishing a guarantee product is prohibitive.  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n5. \nDesign. The Program is designed to work within these constraints and encourage private \nsector  investment  by  using  donor  funds  to  backstop  the  power  payment  obligations  of  power \nutilities.  The  design  for  each  project  under  the  Program  includes  one  or  more  of  the  following \nforms of financing support:  \n\n                                                \n1  A sector overview in presented in Linked Document 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA partial risk guarantee (PRG) covering standard political risks and breaches of \ncontract under the PPA, which includes coverage of failure by the utility to make a \ntermination payment in the event of full default by the power utility, as set out in \nthe  PPA.2 Payment for  breach of  contract  is made under  the  PRG  upon arbitral \naward.3  \nA  direct  loan  provided to support  a  private  sector  IPP  borrower;  or,  where  ADB \ncannot  fund  a  loan  in  local  currency,  then  an  ADB  partial  credit  guarantee \nbenefiting one or more local lenders to the project may be made available to the \nIPP instead of a direct loan. \nA Letter of Credit (LC) facility to cover short-term liquidity risk, to be drawable by \nthe IPP in an amount covering payments due under the PPA for a specific period. \nADB may arrange for a maximum period of 24 months of PPA payments per project. \nThe LC will cover the risk that a power utility as an offtaker fails to make payments \nto the project in accordance with the terms of the PPA, and the LC will be reinstated \nonce the utility has restored the outstanding payments. The LC, if provided, will be \nfully funded by development partner funds. The LC will cover the risk that a power \nutility as offtaker fails to make payments to the project in accordance with the terms \nof PPA.  \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  transaction  advisory  support  and  streamlined \nprocesses  to  reduce  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  relatively  small \ntransaction  sizes  in  the  Pacific,  and  to  assist  with  capacity  building  in \nenvironmental and social safeguards.  \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6. \nThe  above  arrangements  will  benefit  projects  within  the  Program  by  enhancing  the \ncreditworthiness of the power utilities in meeting power payment obligations under the PPA and \nmitigating political risk for lenders. To the extent that concessional financing sources make funds \navailable to the Program, the Program also has the potential to (i) reduce the cost of financing \nthrough lenders by providing longer tenors or lower margins, which in turn is expected to feed \nthrough to a lower power tariff for consumers; and (ii) attract additional investors and lenders that \nhave traditionally found it difficult to accept power utility offtake risk in the Pacific.  \n \n7. \nCombined ADB Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) financing (i.e., the combination of both \nloans and guarantees) for each project under the Program will not exceed $10 million. The PRG \nand/or  loan  for  each  project  will  be  processed  and  approved  under  following  ADB\u2019s  standard \nnonsovereign processes.4  \n \n8. \nProgram development. The Program has been developed by PSOD and PARD under a \n\u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. This approach leverages PARD\u2019s close relationship with the Pacific power \nutilities. The Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility (PREIF) was approved in May 2017 \nto  support  ADB  investment  in  sovereign  renewable  energy  projects  in  the  smallest  11  Pacific \nIsland  member  countries  and  to  assist  in  sector  reform.  PREIF  identified  a  donor-backed \nguarantee program as a key activity to promote private investment in the Pacific energy sector, \nas part of the sector reform agenda. Development of a regional guarantee program is an output \n\n                                                \n2  Expropriation, inconvertibility/nontransferability, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.  \n3  The PRG will not cover PSOD lending. \n4  It is anticipated that ADB will provide both guarantees and financing for most projects, however some projects may \n\nonly utilize one product or the other. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n \n\nProgram Pipeline  \n\nindicator  of  PREIF.  PREIF  funded  design  work  for  the  Program  and  is  envisaged  to  provide \ntechnical assistance during implementation. PSOD and PARD will work together to implement the \nProgram and identify pipeline transactions. PSOD will be responsible for processing guarantees \nand project financing for individual private sector projects. Debt financing terms and conditions to \nsponsors  will  be  determined  on  a  project  by project  basis.  PARD,  PSOD,  and  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) will manage TAs to develop upstream capacity and provide \ntransaction advisory services where practical.5  \n \nMoral hazard. There is potential moral hazard in providing the Program to power utilities \n9. \nthat are unable to access a government guarantee to backstop their offtake obligations because \na power utility may choose to default on its obligations and rely on the backstop support provided \nby the Program. The risk will be mitigated through structures that will differ from project to project \nbut may include (i) cash security from the power utility to cover three months LC on a first-loss \nbasis,6 (ii) the potential for minority equity ownership by the power utility, and (iii) the potential for \nequity investment by national superannuation funds.7  \n \nB. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nProject origination. ADB is currently financing, or has a pipeline to finance, energy sector \n10. \nprojects (mainly renewable energy) in all the PDMCs. ADB is the largest investor in the Pacific \nenergy sector at present. The Program will leverage this extensive network with Pacific power \nutilities to identify planned transactions in the early stages under the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach and \nwill build capacity for energy sector expansion and private sector interest in the region. TA funds \nwill be used to originate transactions  with power utilities and to help Pacific power utilities and \ngovernments to improve the quality of doing business with the private sector. The Program will \nbe made available to all bidders; however, it will include eligibility criteria and is subject to due \ndiligence satisfactory to ADB, internal credit approvals, and final documentation covering each \nIPP and its sponsors. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nImpact and outcome. The impact will be increased generation of renewable energy in \nthe Pacific, as stated under the  Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific 2010\u2013\n2020. 8 The  outcome  will  be  increased  private  sector  investment  in  renewable  energy  in  the \nPacific.9 \n \n12. \nOutputs.  The  Program  output  is  successful  establishment  of  the  Pacific  Renewable \nEnergy Program. The output will support an estimated 5 separate renewable energy projects in \nPDMCs over a 5-year period. \n                                                \n5  Technical assistance may be provided through (i) Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility (AP3F), and (ii) through \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. \n\n6  Any  call under  the LC  will  be  first served  by  the  power  utility  cash balance  prior  to  being  served  pro-rata by  the \n\ndevelopment partners backstopping the letter of credit. \n\n7  The design for addressing moral hazard will be considered on a country by country basis and is discussed further in \n\nLinked Document 2. \n\n8  Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 2011. Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific, 2010\u20132020. \nSuva.  The  Secretariat  of the Pacific  Community  is currently  completing  a  review  of  the Framework  for  Action on \nEnergy Security in the Pacific 2010-2020 and commencing preparation of the next 10-year framework. \n\n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  development  objective  is  to  provide  credit  enhancement  mechanisms  to  hedge \nagainst  the  key  risks  inherent  in  power  projects  in  the  PDMCs,  which  will  increase  private \ninvestment in the energy sector. The Program will (i) lower the cost of financing and encourage \nfinancing with longer tenors, which will feed through to lower power tariffs; (ii) attract new investors \nand  lenders  to  the  PDMCs,  where  they  might  not  otherwise  invest;  (iii)  generate  financing \nopportunities for PSOD; and (iv) increase PSOD\u2019s focus on frontier markets in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 The Program is aligned with the operational priorities of Strategy 2030 in \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability.   \n \n14. \nThe additionality provided by ADB is in sourcing and using available grant funds for the \nPDMCs from ADB\u2019s development partners as a credit enhancement tool that will mobilize private \nfinancing. This will spur self-sustaining private sector development, reduce continued reliance of \npower utilities on grants and subsidies, and increase energy supply. Technical assistance under \nthe  Program  will  assist  in strengthening governance  and institutional  capacity  through  building \nskills in financial sustainability, service delivery, capacity and standards. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nwere incorporated into the Program design.11  \n \n\nStudies by the Independent Evaluation Department highlight the following lessons, which \n\nLessons Learned \n\nMarketing  and  origination  of  potential  guarantees  to  commercial  banks  is  made \ndifficult  because  ADB\u2019s  client  is  the  borrower  and  not  the  beneficiary  of  the \nguarantee.  The  Program  counters  this  problem  through  upstream  engagement \nwith the power utilities to identify a pipeline.  \nKnowledge of the guarantee business is partially lacking within ADB. The Program \novercomes this through a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, whereby PSOD and PARD work \ncollaboratively to identify and implement projects under the Program.  \n\n(iii)  Without forward project identification, programs are often unutilized. This is being \navoided by significant work in upstream project identification and market sounding.  \n\nThe following lessons learnt from development of solar power projects in the Pacific by \n\n \n16. \nPARD have also been incorporated into its Program design.  \n \n\nLand  acquisition.  Land  acquisition  is  a  major  risk  for  development  of  energy \nprojects in the Pacific. Projects should secure land tenure early in the project cycle \nto avoid subsequent delays.  \nPower  grid strengthening.  Some  Pacific grids  require upgrading  of transmission \nand  distribution  systems  prior  to  development  of  renewable  energy  generation. \nRenewable energy feasibility studies must assess grid strength to avoid dispatch \nissues during operation.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2018.

Many Pacific power grids require installation of battery storage for \nadditional  intermittent  renewable  energy  (solar  or  wind)  integration.  Feasibility \nstudies should ensure that battery storage is incorporated into project design. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nF. \n \n17. \n \n\nThe Program will consist of the following instruments: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPartial  Risk  Guarantee.  The  PRG  will  support  commercial  loans  with  an \naggregate principal amount of up to $50 million plus interest and PRG fees thereon \nunder the Program. PRG coverage will wherever possible and appropriate be risk-\nparticipated by concessional financing sources to reduce cost, and increase the \ndiversity of PRG cover, to IPPs undertaking projects under the Program.  \nNonsovereign operations ordinary capital resources loans. ADB will lend up \nto  $50  million  from  its  OCR  to  IPPs  under  the  Program.  As  with  the  PRG \narrangements, in addition to its OCR financing, ADB will seek to draw into each \nproject both parallel cofinancing and, where available and appropriate, third-party \nconcessional financing with ADB as  lender-of-record. Where  a  direct  ADB  OCR \nloan is  not  suitable for  an IPP  because  of a  currency  mismatch,  an  ADB  partial \ncredit guarantee benefiting a local lender to the project may be made available. \n\n18. \n\n \nAdditional support may be made available to the Program, including the following:  \n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nLetter of Credit. The LC for projects will be funded from a $3 million grant provided \nby the Government of New Zealand, which has been approved. Further grant funds \nfrom development partners may be made available to fund LCs in accordance with \ntheir respective trust agreements as the Program matures. Funds from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund may also be considered. The LC for each project will be in an \namount  covering  up  to  twenty-four  months  of  power  payments  from  the  utility. \nWhere practical, the first three months of power payments in cash collateral for the \nLC will be obtained from the utility to take the first loss on the LC if it is called.  \nTechnical  Assistance. TA  will  be  provided  on  a  case-by-case  basis for project \norigination  and  transaction  advisory  support  through  the  Asia  Pacific  Project \nPreparation Facility (AP3F) and PREIF.12  \n\n \n19. \nThe tenor of each PRG will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with \nprospective lenders. Under current market conditions, it is estimated that the tenor will be up to \n15  years.  An  annual  guarantee  fee  and  commitment  fee  will  be  charged  to  the  lender,  to  be \ndetermined  project  by  project.  The  guaranteed  percentage  would  be  up  to  99%  of  principal, \ninterest,  and  guarantee  fees.  The  claims  processed  under  the  PRG  will  follow  standard  ADB \nprocedures. Loan approval will be processed in accordance with NSO lending guidelines under \nADB\u2019s standard nonsovereign processes. Details of the guarantee structure are presented in LD2 \nGuarantee and Debt Structure and will be approved by Management. The Program financing plan \nis presented in Table 2 below.  \n \n\n                                                \n12 To be assessed on a case by case basis.

Loans  and  guarantees  under  the  Program  may  be  prepared  for  approval  under \nADB\u2019s nonsovereign business processes for a 5-year period between April 2019 and April 2024. \nThe deadline for the final approval under the Program will be 30 April 2024. Individual loans and \nguarantees will have a maximum tenor of 15 years. Multiple projects in a single country deploying \nguarantees  or  loans  under  the  Program  may  be  approved.  No  financing  cap  applies  to  an \nindividual country other than the established country exposure limits. Regional projects may also \nbe considered across multiple PDMCs.  \n \n21. \nThe proposed guarantees and loans to the projects to be provided under NSO will all be \nsmall-volume transactions. They will be prepared and processed following normal due diligence \nand processing requirements under ADB\u2019s NSO processes. Qualifying criteria for projects under \nthe Program consist of the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nThe  project  scope  includes  renewable  energy  generation  and  supports  energy \nsector infrastructure.13 \nThe project is in a PDMC. \nProjects that fall under environment category A are excluded. \n\n                                                \n13 Supporting infrastructure includes the required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid operation. This includes, \n\nbut is not limited to, transmission and distribution assets and diesel generation rehabilitation and upgrades. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\n(iv) \n\nThe total ADB NSO exposure is limited to $10 million per project, consisting of a \ncombination of direct NSO loans and an amount of PRG exposure. The financing \nparameters  for  individual  transactions  will  be  approved  in  accordance  with \nguidelines under Operations Manual section D10 (Nonsovereign Operations). \n \n\n22. \nADB  will  report  progress  in  Program  implementation  annually  to  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors  (calendar  year). The first  annual  report  will  be for  the  period  March\u2013December  2019 \nand will be due in April 2020. Prior to 30 September 2021 or when 50% of the approval limit has \nbeen utilized, whichever occurs first, ADB will conduct an interim review of the Program and report \nto the Board, including recommendations for design modifications (if any). \n \n23. \nPSOD  and  PARD  will  work  closely  with  PDMCs\u2019  power  utilities  to  identify  suitable \ntransactions and propose transaction advisory services to OPPP (in close coordination with AP3F \nfor TA support). PSOD will oversee the implementation, monitor the progress of the portfolio and \nrespond  to  any  issues  arising  in  the  guarantee  transaction,  and  prepare  periodic  Program \nprogress reports to donors as required.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nADB will establish a loan and guarantee program that includes PRGs to cover default on \ncommercial loans for qualifying projects caused by restrictions on convertibility and transferability, \npolitical violence, expropriation, and breach of contract (including failure by the utility to make a \ntermination payment in the event of full default by the power utility, as set out in the PPA). ADB\u2019s \nPRGs may benefit from risk transfer arrangements, as appropriate and available, with third-party \nconcessional funds. Such funds will risk-participate with ADB, who will act as guarantor of record. \nAdditionally,  nonsovereign  loans,  or  equivalent  PRGs  to  intermediary  lenders,  may  directly \nsupport  IPPs.  Finally,  TA  for  project  origination  and  transaction  advisory  support  will  be  made \navailable  to  assist  governments  in  streamlined  processing  (standardization  of  PPAs,  bidding \ndocuments,  and  bid  process)  to  reduce  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  relatively  small \ntransaction sizes in the Pacific. In addition to the core OCR elements of the Program, ADB will \nseek  to  bring  additional  value  to  the  Program  by  arranging  for  the  benefit  of  IPPs,  where \nappropriate and available, an LC standby support for power payments due in the event of a breach \nof  payment  obligations  by  the  offtaker  under  the PPA. The  extent  of  the cover  of  debt service \nunder such LC will differ from project to project based on the credit standing of each offtaker and \nthe extent to which concessional funding sources support the use of funds for such a purpose. \nAn LC will reduce the risk to commercial lenders of borrower default under the PPA, and thus \nreduce the cost of funds to the IPP. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s assistance through the Program is crucial in creating an enabling environment and \nlowering  barriers  to  promote  private  sector  investment.  The  Program  is  an  output  indicator  of \nPREIF and fulfils a gap identified by the PREIF. The Program will benefit from the energy sector \nreform  under  the  PREIF  and  build  on  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  energy  projects  in  the \nregion. The Program will improve transparency and governance through upstream TA to identify \nprojects, provide transaction advisory services, and support sector reform to promote the private \nsector.  \n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigations \n\nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \n26. \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Program  will  support  renewable  energy \nprojects, each of which will be separately assessed and processed depending on the financial \nstructure (i.e. LC and PRG, or in combination with a nonsovereign loan). Desk environmental and \nsocial  screening  will  be  conducted  for  each  transaction  to  determine  the  significance  of \nenvironmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  risks  and  impacts.  Projects \ncategorized as Category A for environment will not be included in the Program. Projects under \nthe Program are anticipated to be Environment Category B, Involuntary Resettlement Category \nB, and Indigenous Peoples Category C.  \n \n27. \nEnvironmental  and  social  due  diligence  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and social requirements. The IPPs will engage environmental \nand  social  experts  to  prepare  environmental  and  social  assessment  reports  and  management \nplans  for  their  projects,  such  as  an  Initial  Environmental  Examination  report  and  Resettlement \nPlan (if required). An Environmental and Social Audit report to be filed by an external expert will \nassess  the  environmental,  social,  health  and  safety,  and  gender  risks  and  impacts  associated \nwith  the  project  in  cases  where  the  project  involves  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. \nRecommended mitigation measures and monitoring requirements will be implemented under an \nenvironmental and social management plan. The Implementation of any corrective action plans \nin response to audit findings will also be monitored by and reported to ADB.  \n\n \n\n28. \nTransactions with an NSO loan component will be processed in line with project finance \ntransactions wherein preparation, review and approval of environmental and social requirements \nwill be conducted prior to approval by the ADB Management. For projects benefiting only from a \nPRG, compliance with safeguards and social requirements will be a condition precedent for the \navailability of the guarantees to the IPPs or partner financial institutions. \n \nSocial dimensions. The Program is categorized as having no gender element given the \n29. \nnature of the Program. Each project approved under the Program will aim to achieve some gender \nelements. However, each project sponsor or IPP will comply with the gender related requirements \nof  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001)  such  as \nensuring women's active participation in consultation activities; inclusion of gender issues in the \nconduct  of  social  analysis;  use  of  culturally  appropriate  and  gender  sensitive  methods  in  the \nassessment  of  potential  project  impacts,  including  indigenous  peoples;  and  development  of \ngender  sensitive  consultation,  participation,  and  grievance  mechanisms  for  communities  and \nworkers,  among  others. 14  Each  project  sponsor  will  be  asked  to  commit  to  identifying  and \nimplementing  measures  that  benefit  women  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment. 15  Each  project  sponsor  or  IPP  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  take \nmeasures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nSocial  Protection  Strategy  (2003). 16  Each  IPP  or  project  sponsor  will  undertake  information \ndisclosure and consultation, as applicable following ADB requirements. \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2003.
