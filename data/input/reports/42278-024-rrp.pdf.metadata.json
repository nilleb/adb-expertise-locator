The  project  will  increase  poor  and  disadvantaged  students\u2019  access  to \nTVET through targeted direct stipends and more dormitory spaces at colleges. The project will \nalso undertake TVET promotion  measures  to  improve the  public  image of TVET and  enhance \nunderstanding of TVET products and services among youth, their parents, and communities.3 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nLabor  market  dynamics.  The  Lao  economy  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  7%  from \n2005  to  2015.  The  services  sector  is  the  largest  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  contributor \n(37.9%), employing 19.7% of the labor force. Industry contributed 32.4% to GDP and employed \nabout  8.0%  of  the  labor  force.  Although  about  70.0%  of  the  population continues  to  derive  its \nincome mainly from agriculture, its GDP share fell from about 45.0% in 2000 to 23.1% in 2014. \nGiven a high percentage of the labor force engaged in small farming, more than three-quarters \nof  the  labor force  is  estimated to be  involved  in  informal  sector  activities.  Demographic trends \nsuggest that the labor force will continue to grow until 2025, but the labor market structure will \nchange  as  more  workers  shift  from  agriculture  to  industry  and  services.  However,  business \ncommunities  in  the  industry  and  services  sectors  have  identified  the  lack  of  adequate  skills \namong TVET graduates to be a major challenge in finding better-paying jobs.4 To accelerate the \nshift toward the technology-intensive industry and services sectors, a sufficient supply of labor \nwith  advanced  skills  will  be  essential.  This  requires  aligning  TVET  services  with  labor  market \ndemands.  Currently,  only  one-third  of  workers  of  age  18\u201327  in  nonagricultural  jobs  have  any \npostsecondary,  TVET,  or  higher  education.  The  2015  establishment  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Economic  Community  is  placing  further  pressure  on  the \ngovernment to improve the performance of TVET to advance productivity and competitiveness \nof  Lao  companies.  Although  the  Lao  PDR  made  considerable  progress  in  modernizing  the \nTVET system, it is vital to expand and improve the quality and relevance of TVET to cope with \n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical assistance for  Preparing  the  Second \n\nTechnical and Vocational Education Development Project (TA 8964-LAO).  \n\n2  ADB.  2010.  Report and  Recommendation  of the  President to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the  Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic for Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project. Manila. \n(Grant 0211-LAO, $23.0 million, approved on 9 July 2010 and completed in September 2016).  \n\n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB, International Labour Organization, and German development cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit  reports  suggest  that  skilled labor  is  needed  throughout  the  industry  and services \nsectors.  Manufacturing  companies  need  engineers  and  workers  with  advanced  skills  to  operate  and  maintain \nmachinery, as well as toolmakers, electricians, general mechanics, and information and communication technology \nstaff.  In  construction-related  occupations,  quality  skills  are  in  demand,  including  electricians,  welders,  plumbers, \ncarpenters, and bricklayers. Companies seek graduates with advanced management and administrative skills. \n\n \n\n\fthe increasing demand for a competent workforce.  \n\n4. \nNeed for expansion. The TVET system comprises 23 public vocational colleges under \nthe  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  and  about  40  private  training  providers.  Private \nTVET institutions are mostly located in urban areas, offering programs related to management, \ninformation  and communication technology,  and business  administration,  which do  not  require \nexpensive training  equipment.  About  26,300 students (of  whom  about  10,500 are women)  are \nenrolled  in  public  TVET  colleges,  and  about  36,400  are  enrolled  in  private  TVET  institutions. \nConsidering  (i) demographic  trends,  (ii)  the  growing  demand  for  skilled  labor,  and  (iii)  the \nincreasing  number  of secondary  graduates seeking  to  acquire  technical and managerial  skills, \nthe government anticipates that the number of students in public TVET colleges will increase to \nabout  63,000  by  2020.  This  would  require  a  substantial  expansion  of  the  existing  TVET \ncapacity.  MOES  employs  about  2,300  TVET  teachers.  To  deal  with  the  increased  number  of \nstudents, MOES expects that more than 1,000 new teachers will be required, and MOES also \nanticipates  that  the  current  facilities  at  the  23  public  colleges  will  have  to  be  expanded  and \nupgraded. At present, there are about 1,200 classrooms and workshops at public colleges. By \n2020, about 2,000 classrooms and workshops will be needed to accommodate students. \n\n5. \nTVET  financing. About 15.5% of annual national public expenditure has been directed \nto education from 2008\u20132015. This share is expected to increase to 17.0% by 2020. The share \nof  funding  provided  for  TVET  within  MOES  overall  budget  is  relatively  small.  However, \naccording to  MOES\u2019  projection,  the share  of expenditures for TVET will  increase from 2.7%  in \n2015  to  4.0%  in  2019,  although  no  reliable  estimates  can  indicate  whether  the  projected \nincrease will be adequate to cover the additional costs for expanding facilities, financing a larger \nteaching force, and covering operation and maintenance costs for workshops, dormitories, and \nequipment. Initial estimates of the required capital investments to modernize and expand TVET \ninfrastructure  are  $50.0  million  for  2017\u20132020.  However,  this  estimate  does  not  consider  the \nspecific and costly equipment that will be needed both to introduce new programs and upgrade \nexisting training programs in technology-driven occupations. \n\n6. \nQuality  and  relevance  of  TVET.  Key  issues  in  TVET  include  the  low  level  of \ninvolvement  of  companies  in  TVET  programs  and  in  assessment  schemes,  and  a  lack  of \nopportunities  for  students  to  gain  hands-on  experience  at  college  workshops  or  at  company \nsites.  Another  challenge  is  the  limited  competence  of  teachers  to  adopt  modern  teaching \ntechniques  that  integrate  practical  skills  training  with  theoretical  content.  Outdated  and \ninadequate equipment and workshops hamper teaching and learning at many TVET institutions. \nGiven  limited  formal  employment  opportunities,  many  TVET  graduates  seek  jobs  or  self-\nemployment in the informal sector. To help graduates to start their own businesses, programs \nneed  to  consider  entrepreneurial  approaches  to  improve  the  ability  of  students  to  identify \nbusiness opportunities and respond to local market demand. \n\n7. \nAccess  to  TVET.  Access  to  TVET  is  constrained  by  negative  public  perceptions  of \nTVET coupled  with  a general  preference for  white collar jobs. This  reflects  both  the  perceived \nlow  quality  of  TVET  colleges  and  a  lack  of  understanding  of  TVET  services  and  job \nopportunities  for  TVET  graduates.  Students  and  parents  have  limited  information  on  the \nchanging job market, the careers that will be in demand, salary scales for skilled employment, \nand the role of TVET in preparing students for emerging opportunities. Where there is demand \nfor TVET courses,  economic constraints  often  hamper  access given  high  poverty  rates.  About \ntwo-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 per day, and many families cannot afford the \ndirect  costs  or  the  opportunity  costs  associated  with  sending  their  children  to  a  full-time \nresidential TVET course.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fGovernment  strategy.  The  Eighth  National  Socio-Economic Development  Plan  2016\u2013\n8. \n2020 sets out strategies to promote (i) regional and international integration within the ASEAN \nEconomic  Community,  and  (ii)  industrialization  and  modernization  of  the  Lao  PDR  economy \ntoward  becoming  an  upper-middle-income  country.  The  plan  recognizes  the  importance  of \nhuman  resource  development  in  achieving  the  country's  social  and  economic  objectives  and \nprioritizes  improvement  of  education  services.  Upgrading  TVET  is  part  of  the  human  resource \ndevelopment  strategy  and  the  national  education  sector  reforms.  MOES  endorsed  the  TVET \nDevelopment  Plan  2016\u20132020,  which  aims  to  increase  access  to  TVET  and  strengthen  the \ndelivery of TVET programs. The project will contribute to achieving the targets to (i) expand the \nTVET system and (ii) improve the relevance and quality of programs delivered by colleges. \n\n9. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  Government  of  Germany  supports  12  colleges  and \nprovides (i) policy advice to strengthen the overall TVET system, (ii) technical assistance for the \ndevelopment  of  a  National  Qualification  Framework, 5  standards,  curriculum  modules,  and \ndesign  of  training  programs,  (iii)  limited  funding  for  scholarships,  (iv)  infrastructure  support  to \nupgrade  teaching  and  learning  environments,  and  (v)  assistance  to  the  Vocational  Education \nDevelopment  Institute  in  developing  and  implementing  strategies  to  advance  professional \ndevelopment of teachers. The governments of Switzerland and Luxembourg provide assistance \nto strengthen TVET for tourism  and  hospitality  and  stipends to poor  students. The  modality  of \nthe  project\u2019s  stipend  scheme  will  be  harmonized  with  stipend  programs  of  other  development \npartners. \n\n10. \nLessons  and  ADB  support.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  the  leading \ndevelopment  partner  in  post-basic  education  in  the  Lao  PDR.  ADB  has  supported  the  senior \nsecondary,  TVET,  and  higher  education 6  subsectors  since  2006  and  was  instrumental  in \npreparing  the  national  human  resource  development  strategy.  The  2010  country  assistance \nprogram  evaluation  rated  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  assistance  as  successful. 7 Lessons  from \nADB\u2019s  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project  include  the \nfollowing:  (i) employers  need  to  be  involved  in  planning  at  the  college  level  to  ensure  that \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  and  equipment  are  relevant  and  demand-driven,  (ii)  strong \ncommitment of college leadership is essential to ensure that project investments are sustained \nand modern teaching approaches are adopted, (iii) the complex design of a training assistance \nvoucher program for poor students was too ambitious in its attempt to create competition among \ninstitutions  to  improve  quality  while  also  channeling  resources  to  students,  (iv)  innovative \napproaches to professional  development  for teachers  and managers  are  required  to introduce \nan  entrepreneurial  culture  in  managing  colleges  and  program  delivery,  and  (v)  sufficient \nresources need to be allocated to operate and maintain facilities. Based on these lessons, the \nproject  was  designed  with  a  strong  demand-driven  approach  and  with  the  intention  to \ncomplement  the  efforts  of  other  development  partners  with  a  major  focus  on  expanding  the \ncapacity of and access to TVET and strengthening TVET delivery at the institutional level.8 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact, which is aligned with the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan \nand  the  TVET  Development  Plan  for  2016\u20132020,  will  be  sufficient  skilled  labor  available  to \n                                                \n5   A comprehensive National Qualification Framework is not yet in place. \n6   ADB. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Lao People's \n\nDemocratic Republic for the Second Strengthening Higher Education Project.

Manila.   \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nmaintain  inclusive  and  sustainable  development  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  outcome  will  be  an \nexpanded TVET system aligned with evolving labor market needs. \n\n12. \nThe  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  teaching  and  learning  environments  at  eight  TVET \ncolleges  upgraded,  (ii)  quality  and  relevance  of  demand-driven  programs  improved,  and \n(iii) access to TVET institutions for disadvantaged students increased. Based on the lessons from \nthe previous project, the project will adopt a demand-driven approach to upgrading eight TVET \ncolleges  that  do  not  receive  substantial  support  from  other  development  partners.  To  ensure \nownership  and  meet  the  demands  of  the  local  companies  and  communities,  colleges  prepare \ndevelopment  plans  jointly  with  representatives from  firms  and  communities.  The  plans  identify \nthe key areas of support based on the needs and describe challenges and opportunities of the \nindividual college and include information on student enrollment, teaching force, current training \nprograms,  quality  and  quantity  of  facilities,  budgets,  collaboration  with  communities  and \ncompanies, and brief assessments of the local labor market.9 \n\n13. \nOutput  1:  Teaching  and  learning  environments  at  eight  TVET  colleges  upgraded. \nTo address urgent infrastructure needs, up to $4.6 million from grant proceeds may be allocated \nfor  civil  works  at  (i)  Pakpasak  Technical  College  in  Vientiane,  (ii)  Savannakhet  Technical  and \nVocational  College,  (iii)  Vientiane\u2013Hanoi  Friendship  Technical  and  Vocational  College,  and \n(iv) the  agriculture  campus at  the  Khammouane Technical  and  Vocational  College. These four \ncolleges  will  prepare  detailed  proposals  for  civil  works  to  upgrade  their  facilities,  which  may \ninclude  (i)  constructing  or  renovating  existing  workshops,  (ii)  constructing  and  expanding \ndormitories, (iii) improving water and sanitation facilities, (iv) constructing or rehabilitating school \nkitchens and canteens, and (v) improving the overall environment of college campuses toward \ncreating a green and student-friendly atmosphere. The proposals will indicate the availability of \nadequate  funding  and  competent  capacity  to  effectively  manage  upgraded  facilities.  They  will \ninclude  a  maintenance  plan  indicating  responsibilities  and  resources  for  maintenance  tasks. \nProposals  will  also  provide  a  sound  rationale  for  the  planned  utilization  of  new  and  upgraded \nfacilities  based  on  future  enrollment  projections  and  training  programs  that  are  in  demand  by \nlocal companies and communities. Colleges are developing proposals, and MOES and ADB will \nendorse them after project effectiveness. In addition, the Polytechnic College of Vientiane may \naccess up to $400,000 to rehabilitate and build workshops. \n\nthat  reflect \n\nlabor  market  needs  and  enrollment \n\n14. \nUp  to  $6.0  million  is  allocated  to  purchasing  training  equipment.  During  the  project \npreparatory  phase,  all  eight  project  colleges  began  preparing  proposals  for  equipment  to  be \nreviewed and endorsed by MOES and ADB. Proposals have to be based on current and future \ntraining  programs \nforecasts.  College \nmanagement  must  demonstrate  that  (i)  proposed  equipment  requests  are  in  line  with  ongoing \nand  new  training  programs  that  are  supported  by  local  employers;  (ii)  new  equipment  will  be \nintegrated in training programs to support student-centered teaching approaches and increase \nhands-on  training  opportunities;  (iii)  sufficient  budget  is  available  for  consumables  to  sustain \ntraining  programs;  and  (iv)  teachers  are  able  to  operate  new  training  equipment,  or  will  be \ntrained.  Consultants  will  help  project  colleges  finalize  proposals  and  prepare  the  detailed \n                                                \n9  The  following  colleges  will  be  supported  under  the  project:  (i)  Polytechnic  College  Vientiane,  (ii)  Savannakhet \nTechnical  and  Vocational  College,  (iii)  Pakpasak  Technical  College  (Vientiane  Capital),  (iv)  Dongkhamxang \nAgriculture  Technical  School  (Vientiane),  (v)  Technical  College  of  Vientiane  Province,  (vi)  Champasak  Technical \nand  Vocational  College  (Champasak  Province),  (vii)  Khammouane  Technical  and  Vocational  College,  and \n(viii) Vientiane\u2013Hanoi Friendship Technical and Vocational College. Skills areas identified by the colleges and local \nindustry  include  (i)  automotive,  (ii)  basic  electrical-electronics,  (iii)  road  and  bridge  construction,  (iv)  food \nprocessing and agriculture, and (v) IT related skills.  \n\n \n\n\fequipment technical specifications to be used for tendering. The final amount for civil works and \nequipment for each college will vary and depend on the actual situation and needs, which will be \ndetermined jointly by college management, MOES, and ADB based on the proposals. \n\nOutput  2:  Quality  and  relevance  of  demand-driven  programs  improved.  Output  2 \n15. \nwill provide resources for all eight project colleges to (i) improve technical and pedagogy skills \nand  knowledge  of  teachers  toward  promoting  student-centered  teaching  approaches  and \nincreased  hands-on  training  for  students,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  management  capacity  of \ncurrent  and  future  college  leaders  and  administrators  toward  promoting  an  entrepreneurial \napproach  in  managing  colleges.  The  project  will  engage  individual  consultants  and  a  firm  to \nfacilitate  capacity-strengthening  measures  with  the  intent  to  establish  continuous  training  and \ncoaching opportunities at the colleges based on the needs of teachers and managers. Support \nfor  teachers,  managers,  and  administrators  could  include  (i)  short  technical  and  managerial \ntraining programs, (ii) coaching by senior teachers or industry trainers, (iii) improved inspection \nand guidance at the colleges, (iv) establishing teacher self-help groups, and (v) apprenticeship \nschemes at companies. Teachers will also receive training to ensure that equipment purchased \nunder  the  project  is  used  effectively,  integrated  in  the  teaching  process,  and  suitably \nmaintained.  Training  strategies  for  teachers  will  be  coordinated  with  the  Vocational  Education \nDevelopment  Institute  and  development  partners.  The  project  will  also  provide  $1.6  million  to \nupgrade  the  academic  qualification  of  TVET teachers  from  public  colleges  to  gain  bachelor  or \nmaster\u2019s degrees in their field of specialization.10 \n\n16. \nBased  on  the  first  ADB-financed TVET  project\u2019s  success  in  promoting  short-term  skills \ntraining courses, the project will assist colleges to develop and roll out more of these for out-of-\nschool  youth  and adults.  It  will  promote  entrepreneurial  approaches to help  young  people and \nadults  in  the  informal  sector  upgrade  their  skills  to  find  better-paying  jobs  or  start  self-\nemployment.  Colleges  will  prepare  course  content  and  delivery  methods  based  on  local \ndemand.  Considering  the  high  share  of  women  in  the  informal  sector,  short  courses  will \nparticularly  focus  on  local  needs  that  will  benefit  women.  The  project  will  (i)  introduce  new \ntraining programs responding to industry and community demand, and (ii) develop competency-\nbased  standards,  curriculum modules,  and  training materials. To  help graduates  at the  project \ncolleges find  employment  or  become  self-employed,  the  project  will  establish  career  guidance \nservices for students enrolled at TVET colleges. Career guidance units will establish links with \nthe  local  business  community,  provide  advice  on  job  opportunities  and  salary  expectations, \nfacilitate internships, and provide entrepreneurship guidance for self-employment. \n\n17. \nOutput  3:  Access  to  TVET  institutions  for  disadvantaged  students  increased. \nOutput  3  will  increase  disadvantaged  students\u2019  access  to  TVET  through  (i)  a  $4.0 million \nprogram of targeted direct stipends, and (ii) the development and refinement of TVET promotion \nstrategies  to  increase  demand.  The  stipend  program  replaces  and  streamlines  the  previous \nvoucher system. The stipend amount set in consultation with MOES is better harmonized with \nother  development  partners\u2019  stipend  programs.  The  principle  is  to  make  regular  transfers  that \ncover all costs of attending TVET to minimize the risk of dropping out for financial reasons. To \nbe eligible for the stipend, a student must (i) be poor or disadvantaged, (ii) enroll at one of the \neight project colleges, and (iii) be at least 16 years old. MOES will select the recipients using a \ntransparent process, and at least half of them will be women. Adopting an innovation from other \n\n                                                \n10  The  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  Department  (TVED)  will  select  teachers.  To  receive  support,  teachers \nshould be under 45 years old, supported by their college director, and must have worked at a vocational college for \nat least 5 years. Selected teachers will sign a binding agreement committing to return to their TVET college after \ngraduation for at least 5 years; otherwise, they have to return the entire scholarship amount. TVED will prepare a \ncontract template for ADB review and endorsement prior to the commencement of the scheme. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nexisting  stipend  programs  in  Lao  PDR,  payment  will  be  made  directly  to  students\u2019  bank \naccounts on a monthly basis and will be accessible via ATM cards. The total number of students \nsupported will depend on the duration of the courses they select, but may be as high as 4,600.11 \n\nOutput 3 will also refine and implement TVET promotion strategies to improve the public \n18. \nimage  of  TVET  and  promote  enhanced  understanding  of  TVET  products  and  services  among \nyouth,  including  school  graduates,  their  parents,  communities,  and  potential  employers.  The \ngoal is to increase TVET enrollment. Strategies will include (i) testing and adopting a range of \ncommunication for development tools with the aim of developing a common brand for TVET and \nproviding better information to a diverse range of stakeholders on the potential jobs that skilled \nworkers are able to access; (ii) promotion of the stipend program among eligible disadvantaged \nstudents; and (iii) building on social marketing plans and products created previously by MOES, \nwhich  will  be  expanded  through  (a)  national  media  and  branding  activities to  promote  positive \nperceptions  and  build  awareness,  trust,  and  credibility  of  TVET;  and  (b)  the  rollout  of  social \nmarketing activities in the communities in the geographic area of each project college. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n19. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $26.5  million  (Table  1).  The  government  requested  a \ngrant  not  exceeding  $25.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the \nproject; this is equal to 94.3% of the project cost. The government will contribute $1.5 million or \n5.7% of the project cost (Table 2). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem  \n \nA.

MOES will be \nthe executing agency; the implementing agency will be the Technical and Vocational Education \nDepartment (TVED). The first project\u2019s management unit will continue to facilitate and supervise \nday-to-day \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  Each  college  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation  unit  headed  by  the  college  principal.  A  project  steering  committee  will  provide \noverall project guidance and support cross-agency policy dialogue. The MOES vice-minister for \nTVET  will  chair  the  committee,  with  the  TVED  director  general  as  committee  secretary. \nCommittee members will be representatives from MOES, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Investment,  and  from  business  communities.

They will benefit from improvements of the overall teaching \nand learning  environments.  Demand-driven  training  programs, upgraded  training facilities,  and \npractice-oriented  training  approaches  will  contribute  to  improve  their  skills  and  enhance  their \nemployment and income-earning opportunities after graduation. It is assumed that at least 1,500 \nadults  and  out-of-school  youths  will  benefit  from  short-term  skills  training  courses,  which  will \nhelp them find better-paying jobs or start their own formal sector businesses. Since more than \n\n                                                \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n75% of youths and adults participating in training programs belong to low-income families, the \nproject  will  contribute  to  reducing  poverty.  Companies  will  benefit  from  improvements  in  the \nrelevance and quality of training that will result in better-skilled workers, which will contribute to \nincreased  productivity.  Access  to  TVET  for  poor  students  will  be  enhanced  by  the  stipend \nscheme  and  the  expansion  of  dormitory  capacity.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \nestimated at 17.87%.13 \n\n22. \nThe project should be financially sustainable as the bulk of expenditures is expected not \nto  carry  on  beyond  the  end  of  the  project.  Recurrent  expenditures  such  as  facility  and \nequipment  maintenance  cost  will  be  absorbed  by  government  funding.  Colleges  will  earn \nadditional  income  through  student  fees  and  tailored  training  for  enterprises.  The  TVET \nDevelopment Plan 2016\u20132020 indicates that the budget for TVET is expected to rise, which will \nprovide additional funding to cover recurrent expenditures. Efficiency gains in the eight project \ncolleges will be realized in part through increased enrollment and the resulting higher utilization \nof facilities and equipment, and by adopting an entrepreneurial approach in managing colleges \nmore  efficiently.  The  government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  project  as  a  percentage  of  the  2016 \nTVET budget is 0.3% per year and is expected to decline because of the increase of the overall \nTVET budget. The government\u2019s annual commitment is, therefore, deemed affordable. \n\n23. \nIncremental operating costs will be associated with  the new  dormitory, workshops, and \ntraining  equipment  financed  under  the  project.  The  total  investment  in  facility  upgrading  is \n$11 million.  Assuming  that  operating  costs,  repairs,  and  maintenance  equal  4.0%  of  the \ninvestment,  the  incremental  recurrent  cost  will  be  $440,000  annually  beginning  in  FY2019, \nwhich  amounts  to  less  than  1.5%  of  the  TVET budget.  In  succeeding  years,  this  proportion  is \nlikely to fall as the government TVET budget rises. This, plus the fact that upgraded facilities will \nenable TVET institutions to offer services and start small production of goods to earn additional \nincome, suggests that the project's incremental operating costs are sustainable.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAssessment  of  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  found  that  TVED  has \nsufficient  capacity  to  carry  out  the  project.  TVED  effectively  implemented  the  previous  ADB-\nfinanced  TVET  project  and  other  projects  financed  by  development  partners.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  found  sufficient  capacity  and  staffing  in  the  accounting  and  finance \nsection  of  MOES  to  support  TVED.  The  project  management  unit  established  under  the  first \nTVET project will continue to manage the project activities, including preparing financial reports \nto be submitted to ADB, the Ministry of Finance, and MOES. Consultants will support the unit to \ncarry out procurement and disbursement activities in a timely and effective manner and provide \ntraining  on  financial  planning,  accounting,  and  establishing  and  maintaining  a  performance-\nbased planning and budgeting system. The unit will be supported by the Financial Department \nof  MOES.  Accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and \nauditing  arrangements  were  assessed  by  the  State  Audit  Office,  which  confirmed  that  the \nfinancial management capacity to operate the project was appropriate. The project will support \nthe  TVED  to  supplement  procurement  capacity,  including  training  in  the  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments  for  civil  works  and  bid  evaluations,  and  site  management  and  monitoring  of  civil \n\n                                                \n13  The  Economic  Internal  Return  of  Rate  (EIRR)  is  calculated  based  on  the  projected  rise  in  TVET  students  as  a \nresult  of  the  expansion  of  the  selected  TVET  colleges,  the  improved  employability  of  graduates  as  a  result  of \nquality  improvements  of  the  teaching  and  learning  process,  and  the increased  income  of  TVET  graduates.  Cost \nfactors include investment costs, recurrent costs and opportunity costs. Cost-benefit analysis over 25 years yielded \nan EIRR of 17.87%, which is higher than the EIRR of the first TVET project (15.2%). The detailed Financial and \nEconomic Analysis is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n\fworks implementation. The project will establish a website that will disclose information related \nto  disbursement,  procurement,  and  project  progress.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nBased on the national poverty line, the poverty incidence in the Lao PDR fell from 27.6% \nin 2008 to 23.4% in 2013. The rate of poverty reduction has been slow relative to the high rate \nof  GDP  growth,  which  has  not  translated  into  commensurately  high  growth  in  consumption. \nInequality has increased, two-thirds of the population continues to live on less than $2 per day, \nand  many  households  remain  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty.  The  national  average \nimprovements  in  welfare  mask  significant  differences  between  regions  and  socioeconomic \ngroups. In 2013, the poverty incidence was highest among those households whose head had \nno  formal  education  (42.0%)  or  only  some  primary  (36.0%),  and  lowest  among  those \nhouseholds  whose  head  had  a  university  degree  (4.0%)  or  had  completed  vocational  training \n(6.0%).  This  shows  the  direct  link  between  TVET  and  improved  welfare.  The  stipend  scheme \nwill  benefit  up  to  4,600  students,  of  whom  at  least  half  will  be  young  women.  By  promoting \nequitable access to improved quality TVET, including through stipends targeted to the poor and \nvulnerable,  the  project  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Equipped  with  better  skills, \nyoung  people  will  have  access  to  better  jobs,  earn  higher  incomes,  and  be  the  drivers  of \ninclusive growth.  \n\n26. \nThe project includes a gender action plan to promote women\u2019s increased participation in \nproject  benefits.  Fewer  women  are  enrolled  in  secondary  and  tertiary  education  than  men, \nhighlighting that women still face challenges in completing a full cycle of education to the tertiary \nlevel.  The  gender  gap  in  favor  of  men  is  more  pronounced  among  the  poor,  with  disparities \nhighest  in  the  north  and  in  rural,  remote,  and  ethnic  areas,  as  well  as  among  those  whose \nmothers  have  no  education.  Key  project  targets  include:  (i)  by  2020,  90%  of  both  female  and \nmale TVET college graduates find employment or start their own business in the area they have \nbeen  trained  in  within  6  months  of  graduation;  (ii)  50%  of  the  new  dormitory  spaces  are \nreserved for female students; (iii) dormitories have separate spaces and facilities for women and \nmen; (iv) all female managers and teachers at the project colleges will participate in pedagogy, \ntechnical,  and  management  training;  (v)  35%  of  teachers  of  the  academic  upgrading  program \nare  women;  (vi)  skills  standards  manuals,  new  TVET  curriculum,  and  training  programs \ndeveloped  under  the  project  are  gender-sensitive  and  provide  positive  images  of  women; \n(vii) 50% of students in apprenticeship schemes in companies are women; (viii) 50% of students \nin short-term training courses for out-of-school youth are women; (ix) 30% of career counsellors \nare women; and (x) 50% of stipend assistance is provided to women. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nThe  involuntary  resettlement  category  is  C,  as  civil  works  are  limited  to  upgrading \nexisting  facilities  and  constructing  new  buildings  within  the  boundaries  of  the  respective \ncolleges,  which  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The  indigenous  peoples' \ncategorization  is  C.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples, and will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. The environmental \ncategorization  is  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  carried  out  and  an  environment \nmanagement plan was developed.14 The operation of workshops will ensure proper disposal of \nwaste.  During  construction,  the  contractor  will  keep  noise  and  dust  within  locally  acceptable \n                                                \n14  Initial Environment Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nlevels,  as  well  as  manage  fill,  excavated  material,  and  solid  waste  in  a  manner  that  does  not \ncreate a permanent impact.   \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in  detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.15 The  major  risks  are  that  the  government \nfails  to keep  its  commitment  to  increase funding  for  TVET,  the  supply  of  appropriately  trained \nteachers  is  not  adequate  to  improve  TVET  quality,  and  the  poor  social  perception  of  TVET \nmeans  that  employers  and  potential  students  are  not  interested  in  TVET.  These  risks  are \naddressed under the project. The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks. \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFailure to provide sufficient \nfunding to expand TVET \nservices and sustain quality of \nTVET provision \nInadequate supply of trained \nteachers will frustrate the ability \nto improve TVET. \nPoor social perception of TVET \nwill limit potential trainees' \ninterest in TVET. \nLack of sufficient funds to \nensure O&M of workshops and \ntraining equipment \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government has endorsed the TVET Master Plan 2016\u20132020, and is \ncommitted to gradually increasing the allocation to TVET to expand the system. \nThe project will contribute to the investment plan by financing the expansion of \nTVET facilities at eight colleges. \nThe government is in the process of strengthening the pre-service training of \nnew teachers. The project will complement efforts of the government and other \ndevelopment partners to improve the capacity of the existing teaching force. \nThe project will provide resources for a TVET promotion campaign, which will \ncontribute to students\u2019, parents\u2019, and communities\u2019 increased understanding of \nthe value of TVET products and services. \nThe Ministry of Education and Sports will ensure that O&M arrangements are \nreflected in annual budget plans to ensure sufficient funding. The project \nincludes training for college managements and teachers to understand the \nneed for O&M provisions and ensure that appropriate technical and financial \nmeasures for O&M are included in the annual plans and budgets. \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, TVET = technical and vocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n29. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set out in the grant agreement.  \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n30. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $25,000,000  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  for  the  Second  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training \nProject, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n27 September 2016 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned With \n \nSufficient skilled labor available to maintain inclusive and sustainable development in the Lao PDR \n(Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan and the TVET Development Plan for 2016\u20132020)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nTVET system \nexpanded and \naligned with evolving \nlabor market needs \n\nOutputs  \n1.
