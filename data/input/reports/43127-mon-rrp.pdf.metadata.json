This is primarily centered around expenditure restraint \nin  view  of  the  dramatic  worsening  of  prices  of  key  exports, \ndwindling international reserves, and increased pressures on its \ncurrency. The Government is acutely aware of the pressure the \ncurrent  global  crisis  is  placing  on  Mongolia's  most  vulnerable \ncitizens and has therefore asked the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to help safeguard achievements in the education sector and \nto mitigate any negative impact of the crisis on the poor. The \nProject will support (i) financing of meals at preschools for children \nages 2\u20135 to protect access to preschools for poor children; (ii) \ncontinuation of the targeted provision of textbooks to secondary \nschool students from poor families; (iii) provision of block grants to \nschools  in  need  of  operation  and  maintenance  funds;  and  (iv) \ncapacity building at the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science \n(MECS) in financial management, budgeting, and monitoring and \nevaluation to enable MECS to better deal with budget constraints. \nThe Project is in line with the $229.2 million standby arrangement \nof the International Monetary Fund for Mongolia that requires the \nGovernment  to  maintain  a  tight  fiscal  policy  to  restore  fiscal \nsustainability, and advocates donor support to mitigate the impact \nof the fiscal adjustment on the poor. The Project complements the \nSocial Sectors Support Program approved in June 2009 that will \nsupport a comprehensive overhaul of the existing system of social \ntransfer programs to better target these programs to the very poor \nwhile  conserving  fiscal  resources.  The  Social  Sectors  Support \nProgram  will  introduce  proxy  means  testing  (PMT)  to  improve \ntargeting of the provision of free textbooks and the Project will help \nMECS  operationalize  PMT  and  enhance  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of education service delivery. The Project is a sector \nintervention that will support the Government in addressing short-\nterm financing needs and continuing longer-term policy reform in \nthe education sector. \n ", "ii \nRationale  Mongolia  ranks  high  among  comparator  countries  in  terms  of \neducation expenditures, enrollment figures and completion rates. \nAchievements  in  expanding  access  to  preschool  and  basic \neducation are at risk of being undermined by the current crisis. \nMaintaining access to education for the poor and ensuring quality \neducation  services  during  the  period  of  necessary  fiscal \nadjustments is a major challenge for the Government. Decreasing \nreal wages and unemployment impede poor households' ability to \nprovide adequate food and necessities. Without continuation of \nassistance programs, poor households may be forced to withdraw \ntheir  children  from  school,  and  to  revert  to  inadequate  diets \nresulting in malnutrition. The likely increase in dropout rates of \nschool students is serious because of the significant risk that such \nstudents will not return to school even after economic conditions \nhave improved, or that they will not be able to catch up with their \npeers when they return. The Project's pro-poor approach will focus \non (i) free feeding programs at preschools to ease the financial \nburden  on  parents,  and  to  provide  an  incentive  for  preschool \nenrollment and attendance; (ii) targeted provision of textbooks to \nsecondary  school  students  from  poor  families  to  help  maintain \nschool attendance rates; and (iii) provision of block grants to fund \nschool  operational  cost  and  essential  learning  and  teaching \nmaterials in selected schools. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will ensure that access to and quality of \neducation  will  be  maintained  and  system  efficiency  further \nenhanced during the time of the economic and financial crisis and \nthereafter. The outcome is adequate financing of textbooks, free \nfeeding  programs  at  preschools, and  school  operation costs  in \nschool year (SY) 2009/10 and 2010/11; and improved efficiency of \nthe education sector. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The project investment cost is estimated at $26,360,000.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n Source  Total    % \n Asian Development Bank  17.00    64.5 \n Government of Mongolia   9.36    35.5 \nTotal      26.36       100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A grant of $17,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe  provided  to  finance  64.5%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  $9,360,000  in  the  form  of  counterpart \nfinancing  for  feeding  programs  at  preschools  and  secondary \ntextbooks in 2009. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2012 \n   \n \n ", "iii \nEstimated Project  Until 30 March 2012  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) \n   \nImplementation  The project steering committee (PSC) established under the ADB-\nArrangements  financed Education Sector Reform Project shall assume the role of \nthe  PSC  under  this  Project  and  provide  overall  guidance  and \ncoordination for Project implementation. The chair of the PSC, with \nthe concurrence of the existing PSC members may appoint, as \nrequired, representatives of other relevant agencies as new PSC \nmembers. The PSC will meet quarterly and be responsible for (i) \napproving  the  annual  Project  budget  and  activity  plan,  and  (ii) \nreviewing and advising on implementation progress. The Project \nimplementation unit (PIU) responsible for the daily operation of the \nADB-financed Third Education Development Project (TEDP) will \nserve as the PIU for the Project. The PIU will oversee and manage \nproject implementation, including the procurement, recruitment of \nconsulting services and disbursement activities. Five new PIU staff \nwill  be  recruited,  including  a  deputy  project  manager,  a \nprocurement  officer,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  an \naccountant, and an education specialist. The procurement capacity \nof MECS was assessed and found to be adequate. MECS has \nextensive  implementation  experience  through  the  TEDP  PIU, \nwhich has been in place since the mid-1990s. Staff is experienced \nin  procurement,  consultant  recruitment,  and  overall  project \nimplementation.  The  PIU  will  report  to  the  project  director  and \nprovide  quarterly  results-based  progress  reports  to  the  PSC, \nMECS management, and ADB.  \n   \nProcurement  Grant-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time).  Procurement  of  new  textbooks  will  use  national \ncompetitive bidding, textbooks already approved by MECS will use \ndirect contracting and shopping, and interactive training modules \nfor school principals will use international competitive bidding and \nnational competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 31 person-months of international consulting services \nand  75  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be \ncontracted  with  grant  funds.  The  international  and  national \nconsultants will have expertise in education finance, management, \nand planning; textbook provision systems; delivery of school block \ngrants; child nutrition and early childhood education; central and \nlocal  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  school  management. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  Students enrolled in preschool, primary, and secondary schools \nBeneficiaries  will be direct beneficiaries of the Project. The Project will benefit an \n ", "iv \nestimated 150,000 children ages 2\u20135 by providing a free feeding \nprogram,  thereby  supporting  their  normal  mental  and  physical \ndevelopment. In addition, about 100,000 students from low income \nfamilies  will  benefit  from  receiving  free  textbooks.  At  least  two \nthirds of beneficiaries will be children from poor families. The most \nsignificant benefit will come from preventing malnutrition among \nvulnerable and at-risk children and maintaining current enrollment \nlevels. Simultaneously, the Project aims to reduce school dropout \nrates by providing essential learning materials such as textbooks \nfor  poor  students  and  to  maintain  a  conducive  learning \nenvironment.  Capacity  building  activities  focus  on  improved \nefficiency of budgeting and financial management in the education \nsector and on enhanced transparency. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Successful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption \nthat the Government will (i) continue to prioritize education and \nlimit budget cuts in the education sector during the financial crisis; \n(ii)  be  committed  to  improving  the  provision  of  textbooks  to \nsecondary  students  and  meals  at  preschools  to  enhance  the \neffectiveness  and  efficiency  of  education  services  delivery;  (iii) \nintroduce  and  effectively  implement  PMT  as  a  targeting \nmethodology for providing textbooks to secondary school students; \nand (iv) maintain its commitment to enhance national and local \ncapacity  and  transparency  in  the  fields  of  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation. The following risks are \nidentified: \n \nLack  of  Sound  Budgeting  and  Financial  Management.  At \npresent, MECS\u2019s managerial and technical capacity to respond to \na  drop  in  the  available  budget  and  regarding  reform \nimplementation, and monitoring and evaluation is limited. This risk \nwill be mitigated through capacity building in finance, budgeting, \nplanning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  development  of  a \ncomprehensive education management information system policy. \nFinancial risks involve potential difficulties in the continuation of the \ntargeted  provision  of  free  textbooks  and  free  preschool  meals \nbeyond the Project's duration. To mitigate this risk, ADB will work \nclosely with the Government to identify savings based on efficiency \ngains, including savings from improved targeting mechanisms that \nwill  allow  continued  and  gradually  increasing  support  for  poor \nstudents. \n \nGovernance Risks in the Provision of Meals at Preschools, \nTargeting of Textbooks, and Block Grants. Governance risk will \nbe  addressed  by  providing  clear  operating  guidelines  for \nmonitoring the implementation of relevant project components. A \ntotal of 8 person-months of international consulting services and \n39 person-months of national consulting services are envisaged \nspecifically  for  monitoring  the  delivery  of  meals  at  preschools, \ntextbooks, and block grants. A related risk is the limited capacity of \nthe education administration with regards to procurement. This risk \n ", "v \nwill  be  mitigated  by  inputs  from  the  ADB-funded  subproject \nSupport for the Implementation of the Sector Risk Assessment in \nthe  Education  Sector  financed  by  the  Governance  Cooperation \nFund, which is addressing procurement and corruption risks and \nsupports institutional and staff capacity building in MECS. Finally, \nthe Government has no previous experience in administering block \ngrants. This risk will be mitigated by developing guidelines for the \nadministration  of  block  grants,  a  related  strong  monitoring \nframework, and testing of a pilot project before scaling up the block \ngrant approach to local school financing at the national level.  \n ", "96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nMONGOLIA\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nEDUCATION FOR THE POOR\u2014F  INANCIAL C  RISIS\nRESPONSE PROJECT\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaanbayshint Ulaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Nogoonnuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor Lun ULAANBAABTaAgRanuur Batnorov\nDariv TOV Nalayh\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg Zuunmod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad Tamsagbulag\nYarant Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nTogrog Buutsagaan Arvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nBichigt\nMandalgovi\nNariynteel SUHBAATAR\nGOVI-ALTAY\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nTsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo 42 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nN\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC Main Road\nOF  CHINA  Provincial Road\nRailway\n0 50 100150200250\nRiver\nKilometers Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n9\n-1\n6\n2\n9 H 96o  00'E 111o  00'E\nR", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \nMongolia for the Education for the Poor\u2014Financial Crisis Response Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The  Macroeconomic  Context  and  its  Social  Impact. Mongolia has made significant \neconomic progress since its transition from socialism in 1992. Fundamental economic reforms \nhave been undertaken in the areas of price liberalization and privatization, giving Mongolia one of \nthe least restrictive trade regimes in Asia, and a relatively liberal foreign investment environment. \nThe country\u2019s vast mineral resources, notably copper, have attracted significant direct foreign \ninvestment  and  created  substantial  revenue  flows.  Increased  budget  revenues  allowed  the \nGovernment of Mongolia (the Government) to implement large wage increases and introduce \nuntargeted social transfers. Despite economic growth across diverse sectors, Mongolia remains \nhighly dependent on mining, leaving the country vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices.  \n \n3.  Since the third quarter of 2008, the current account imbalance has been under pressure \nbecause of the dramatic fall in terms of trade with declining export revenues from minerals and \nagricultural  products.  The  price  of  copper  fell  by  60%  to  $3,500/ton  in  March  2009  as  a \nconsequence  of  rapidly  falling  demand.  Although  copper  prices  have  been  rising  again  very \nrecently,  the  large  drop  in  mineral  revenues  had  an  immediate  negative  effect  on  the  fiscal \naccount, the balance of payments, and the Government\u2019s capacity to sustain universal social \ntransfers.1 While revenue as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is at 2005 levels, spending \nin 2009 is almost one-third higher, fueled in part by the distribution of universal social benefits. With \none third of Mongolia\u2019s population still living in poverty, the resulting social consequences of the \ncrisis can be severe unless the Government is able to include special measures in its adjustment \npolicies and response to this external shock.  \n \n4.  The financial crisis comes in the wake of severe spikes in food and oil prices in 20082  that \ntriggered an inflation rate of 33% in May 2008, much higher than in most other Asian countries.3 \nThe prices of wheat (primarily imported) and meat (domestically produced) contributed to nearly \nhalf of the overall inflation.4 Rising food and fuel prices and high inflation negatively affected the \npoor and vulnerable more than other population groups. The International Monetary Fund has set a \ntarget for the current account deficit in 2009 of around 6.5% of GDP, which can only be achieved if \nthe  Government  cuts  down  on  public  expenditures,  including  for  social  services.  A  detailed \noverview of the macroeconomic context is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n5.  Social Impact of the Crisis. Mongolia is among the 29% of all developing countries highly \nexposed to the poverty effects of the crisis. This is due, in part, to the reliance on volatile mining \n                                                 \n1  The price of copper has since increased but demand remains volatile due to the weak global economy. \n2  Palanivel, T. 2008. Policy Note on the Soaring of Food and Oil Prices in Mongolia: Causes, Consequences and \nResponses at the Macro Level. Colombo: United Nations Development Programme/Regional Center in Colombo \n(UNDP/RCC).  \n3  Inflation reached an 11-year high in the People\u2019s Republic of China (at 8.7% in February 2008), a 9-year high in the \nRepublic of Korea (at 5.5% in June 2008), a 26-year high in Singapore (at 7.6% in April 2008), and a 12-year high in \nViet Nam (at 25.2% in May 2008). \n4  This is because the highest increase in food prices (on a year-on-year basis) was posted in 2008: 59% in May 2008 \nand 57% in June 2008, compared with about 7% during the corresponding months in 2007. Wheat prices increased by \n47% and meat products by 49% since the beginning of 2008. \n ", " 2 \nrevenues and the large percentage of existing poor.5 In 2007\u20132008, about 35.2% of the population \nwas classified as poor.6 Achievements in poverty reduction are threatened by the consequences of \nthe  economic  crisis.  The  poor  who  rely  on  affordable  access  to  basic  social  services  and \nassistance are hardest hit in times of economic stress. \n \n6.  The Mongolia Country Poverty Assessment7 highlights several structural aspects of poverty \nthat are aggravated by the crisis. These include (i) rising inequality\u2014the strong economic growth in \nthe country during recent years has not translated into greater poverty reduction;8 (ii) worsening \nspatial  inequalities\u2014while  the  poverty  rate  has  declined  substantially  in  Ulaanbaatar,  it  has \nincreased  in  soum  and  countryside  areas;  (iii)  insufficient  social  safety  nets  and  coping \nmechanisms in rural and urban areas; (iv) high reliance on social welfare benefits even before the \ncrisis, especially on the Child Money Program;9 and (v) households having difficulty paying for \nschool expenses. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Social Sectors Support Program \n(SSSP)10 aims to support the Government during the financial crisis in terms of policy reforms in \nsocial services delivery, including education, health, and social welfare.  \n \n7.  The current financial crisis is likely to result in increased poverty, the magnitude of which \nwill be determined by the length and depth of the crisis and the effectiveness of countermeasures. \nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis demonstrated how the economic slump resulted first in large \nincreases in unemployment and poverty, which then triggered the worsening of education and \nhealth outcomes. When poor households suffer loss of income, more children and young people \ndrop out of school; engage in child labor; and suffer from malnutrition, stunting, and other health \nissues. The lessons of the 1997 financial crisis indicate the need for substantial government \nintervention to maintain long-term growth and social stability, and to minimize cutbacks in social \ninvestments that are critical for education and health programs\u2014despite shortfalls of government \nrevenues and drying up of private capital flows. These lessons were considered in the design of \nthe Project (Appendix 1). \n \n8.  Education  Sector  Performance. Mongolia ranks high among comparator countries in \nterms of education expenditure, enrollment figures, and completion rates. Immediately before the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union in 1990, Mongolia had a high gross enrollment ratio and adult literacy \nrate. The cessation of Soviet financial and technical support had a dramatic impact on overall \neducation service provision, with the enrollment ratio falling to 81% in 1995. Since then, Mongolia \nhas made notable progress reclaiming previous achievements in the education sector. In 2006, the \ngross enrollment rate had recovered to 95% for primary and secondary education, and the adult \nliteracy rate was maintained at 97%. Between 2002 and 2007, annual public expenditure on \neducation  was  high  (about  6%\u20137%  of  GDP),  much  higher  than  in  many  other  developing  \ncountries. An overview of the Mongolian education sector and its performance is in Appendix 2. An \noverview of external assistance to Mongolia is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2009.

While some of the lost achievements were recovered in \nthe meantime, preschool coverage is still perceived to be insufficient. Of the total enrollment rate of \n57% in school year (SY) 2007/08, 43.8% were enrolled in traditional kindergartens and 13.3% in \nalternative forms11 of preschool education. Preschool enrollment in soum and bagh areas (rural \nareas characterized by higher poverty than urban areas) accounted for 41% of the total preschool \nenrollment; children living in aimags (excluding Ulaanbaatar) accounted for 25%, and herders\u2019 \nchildren accounted for 15%.12 Preschool enrollment in rural areas is relatively strong because of \nthe work of international organizations such as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Save \nthe Children, World Vision, and the Education for All-Fast-Track Initiative,13 which have contributed \nto preschool service provision in rural areas. ADB is assisting the Government to further improve \nthese services through a proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project14 that aims to provide \n400  ger  (mobile)  kindergartens  for  rural,  nomadic,  and  migrant  children.  Given  the  regional \ndisparities in poverty incidence (e.g., a poverty rate that is more than 50% in the western region), \nan  estimated  50%\u201360%  of  preschool  children  in  some  aimags  are  from  poor  families.  The \nMongolia Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP) (2006\u20132015) identifies preschool education as a \npriority issue and makes improved access to preschool education part of the overall target to be \nattained  by  2015.  The  three  main  factors  affecting  preschool  enrollment  are  poverty,  lacking \ncapacity of kindergartens, and underdeveloped infrastructure.15 With the adoption of the Preschool \nEducation Law in 2008 which states that the Government will cover 100% of the meal cost in \npreschools, preschool enrollment increased by 22% in 2009, particularly among children from poor \nfamilies who previously could not afford to pay 50% of the meal cost. A description of the preschool \nsystem of Mongolia is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n10.  The ongoing partnership between the Government and ADB and with other development \npartners (notably the Government of Japan in the education sector) has been a major factor in \nreclaiming some of the previous achievements in the education sector. ADB assistance for the \nsector  began  in  1996  with  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP). 16  ESDP \nsucceeded in helping to rationalize the education system, improving cost recovery, supporting \nprivatization  and  private  sector  provision,  enhancing  management  capabilities,  and  upgrading \neducation content. It contributed significantly to increased enrollment rates from 81% in 1996 to \n91%  in  2002,  and  to  decrease  dropout  rates  from  3.5%  to  2.3%  over  the  same  period.  A \npostproject performance evaluation in April 2007 rates the program \u201chighly successful.\u201d Under the \nSecond Education Development Project17 and Third Education Development Project (TEDP),18 ADB \nsupported initiatives for in-service teacher training, development of curriculum and state education \nstandards, enhancement of education management and planning, and rehabilitating schools and \nother learning organizations.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.   Key Problems \n \n12.  Budget Cuts in Education. The impact of the financial and economic crisis on education \nwas a decrease in the education budget and households\u2019 ability to meet the costs of education due \nto  increasing  unemployment  and  poverty,  and  reduced  purchasing  power.  Funding  gaps  in \neducation  existed  before  the  financial  crisis,  and  are  expected  to  have  widened  during  the \neconomic downturn. The 2009 approved budget for MECS was MNT432,480.5 billion.22 With the \nonset of the crisis, the budget was amended to MNT396,532 billion or an 8.3% cut affecting both \nrecurrent costs and capital investments.23 In the recurrent costs segment of the budget, cuts \nincluded (i) salaries, wages, and related expenditures (reduced by 2.8%); (ii) other goods and \nservices for line items including electricity, heating, transportation, and stationery (reduced by \n22.3%);  and  (iii)  education  capital  budget  for  the  construction  of  schools,  dormitories,  and \nkindergartens (reduced to 18.9%). The budget for the provision of textbooks also experienced a \nmajor shortfall. The National Action Plan 2009\u20132012 stipulates that free textbooks will be provided \nfor all students and the Government budgeted approximately $11 million in 2009. However, less \nthan $1 million is currently available from the national budget, amounting to a funding gap of $9.7 \nmillion for 2009 and 2010. The overview of education financing is in Supplementary Appendix D. \nThe problem tree analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  Budget Gaps in Feeding Program at Preschools. To increase preschool enrollment rates \n(57% in 2008), the Government made a commitment to provide free meals through a provision in \nthe Preschool Education Law (2008). Until then parents were required to pay 50% of the meal cost. \nWith the financial crisis, the budget allocated for preschool meals became insufficient. In addition, \nthe 2009 budget underestimated the costs for preschool meals\u2014a meal per child in a daycare \nkindergarten was calculated at $0.44 and in a boarding kindergarten at $0.66\u2014but with inflation \nand increased food prices, the adjusted real cost was $0.7424 for daycare kindergartens and $1.00 \nfor boarding kindergartens. The incentive of free meals had attracted many parents to send their \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2008. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Mongolia.

The Government, currently facing a total funding gap of approximately $13 million in 2009 \nand 2010, asked ADB to finance this budget gap. \n \n14.  Increasing  Malnutrition.  Although  MECS  does  not  monitor  education  indicators  by \nincome, interviews with preschool directors and focus group discussions (FGDs) with parents \nindicate that the increase of 22% in preschool enrollment has been mainly because of children \nfrom poor families who previously could not afford to pay 50% of the meal cost. The poor already \nspend a much higher proportion of their income on food than those who are better off, with the \npoorest  third  spending  as  much  as  60%  of  their  earnings  on  food.25 In  Mongolia,  declining \nhousehold purchasing power may lead to a declining nutritional status for children, thus affecting \ntheir ability to learn. According to UNICEF, rates of childhood stunting could increase by 3%\u20137% \nand wasting by 8%\u201316% during the financial crisis. A Mercy Corps Study (2008) on food security in \nMongolia revealed that one third of households are food insecure and 20% of children are stunted. \nThe primary determinants of food insecurity identified in this study are poverty, unemployment, and \nlack of job security. FGDs reveal that feeding and adequate nutrition have become a concern and \nthat many families, including teachers, have only one hot meal per day. Feeding programs at \nschools and preschools is seen as an incentive for school attendance. Given the high proportion of \nchildren from poor families enrolled in preschools, financing preschool meals is considered a pro-\npoor approach. \n \n15.  Declining School Operation and Maintenance Budgets. Between 2006 and 2009, the \nproportion of the recurrent budget allocated for maintenance in primary and secondary schools \ndeclined from 1.3% to 0.3%. In addition, the proportion of the recurrent budget allocated to heating \ncosts for primary and secondary education declined from 15.1% to 9.1%. As a result, food has \novertaken heating as the second largest cost item of recurrent expenditure. The introduction of the \nSchool Tea Program26 (midday snacks for all primary school children) in 2008 increased the \nrecurrent budget allocated to food from 7.8% in 2006 to 13.2% in 2009. The budget for the School \nTea Program is kept intact for 2009, and adequate financing is anticipated in 2010. \n \n16.  The Government has prioritized expenditures as a result of the crisis in the following order: \n(i) wages and salaries, (ii) social security and pension payments, (iii) transfers to households, (iv) \nfixed costs, and (v) others. After paying for the remaining fixed costs\u2014electricity, transport and \nfuel, and water supply and treatment\u2014in 2009, only 3% of the recurrent budget (MNT6,339.5 \nmillion  or  $4.5  million)  remains  for  primary  and  secondary  schools  to  cover  professional \ndevelopment  of  teachers,  stationery,  materials,  communication  expenses,  and  uniforms  for \nnonteaching support staff (down from 5.6% in 2006.)  \n \n17.  During project preparation, a school survey was completed in 107 schools in 16 aimags. In \naddition, 54 FGDs were conducted with about 570 parents, teachers, and school administrators in \nfour aimags (Arhangay, Govisumber, Tov, and Zavhan) and in the periurban and central areas of \nUlaanbaatar. FGDs and meetings with school principals reveal significant budget shortfalls to \n                                                 \n25 UNICEF. 2009. Conference Report on the Impact of the Economic Crisis on Children. Singapore (6\u20137 January). \n26 In 2006, Mongolia's Prime Minister \u041c. Enkhbold signed government decree N194 on the Implementation of the School \nTea Program and the Minister of Education U. Enkhtuvshin signed resolution N301 on the Implementation of the \nSchool Tea Program. Initially, school snacks were provided to students in grades 1 and 2, based on MNT300 per child. \nIn school year 2006/07, the school snack program was extended to grades 1\u20134. A government decree N45 dated \nJanuary 2008 extended the school snack program to students in grades 1\u20135, and increased the cost of a meal to \nMNT400 per child. The 2009 budget for the school snack program was MNT18.7 billion, with no cut in the School Tea \nProgram. Adequate budget for the program is projected for 2010 and the Government has plans for gradually shifting \nfrom a school snack to a full lunch program. However, such a transition requires upgrading school kitchen facilities and \nincreasing related operating costs. The program was included under Other Goods and Services in the 2008 budget but \nis included under Subsidies and Transfers in the 2009 budget, mainly because of two different sources of funding.  \n ", " 6 \nsustain  such  services  as  electricity,  heating,  cleaning,  basic  school  maintenance,  in-service \nteacher training, learning and teaching materials, computers, laboratory and workshop operations, \nand others. As a result, the quality of education has declined and the learning environment has \ndeteriorated. FGDs and survey results suggest that many schools cope by either reducing school \nactivities, overreporting enrollment data to secure larger per capita budget allocations, or passing \non the budget gap to parents through increased parental contributions. The restoration of realistic \nand adequate operating budgets to support the delivery  of curriculum objectives, and quality \neducation is a high priority. \n \n18.  Inadequate Conditions in Boarding Schools. Because of the low population density and \nthe nomadic lifestyle in many rural areas, boarding schools play a critical role in the education \nsystem. In 2008/09, 493 boarding schools enrolled 42,086 students (about 8% of the overall \nstudent population), of which 36,786 were herders\u2019 children. The costs of maintaining small rural \nschools and boarding schools are high. At the same time, extreme winter is difficult for young \nchildren, and maintaining sufficient heating is vital and expensive. The national education budget \nfor heating declined from 15% in 2006 to 9% in 2009; boarding schools are more affected than \nregular schools, given that dormitories require heating 24 hours a day in cold weather.  \n \n19.  Increasing  Poverty  and  Cost  of  Education.  The  recent  Household  Income  and \nExpenditure  Survey  (2007\u20132008)  indicates  that  poverty  in  Mongolia  increased  from  29%27 in \n2002/03 to 35.2% in 2008 (footnote 7). The average figure conceals substantial regional disparities \nwith poverty rates of more than 50% in the western region. The 2009 Mongolia Country Poverty \nAssessment (footnote 7) also highlights increasing poverty in rural areas and the need to manage \ninequality. The findings of the school survey and of FGDs reveal that the economic crisis already \nhas had a significant impact on families and schools, including a substantial decrease of household \nincome, weaker consumer confidence, declining spending power, and falling standard of living. \nParents report that wages have remained static or are declining and real incomes have decreased. \nOverall, 86% of respondents of the school survey indicate that parents' purchasing power has \ndecreased and 73% feel that poverty among parents has increased. Families are borrowing from \nbanks to meet the rising cost of living. Respondents report that parental costs of education have \nincreased,  including  costs  of  textbooks,  stationery  and  school  supplies,  food,  uniforms,  and \ntransportation. Social analysis carried out in the preparation of the Food and Nutrition Social \nWelfare Program and Project28 demonstrates that the poor who were directly affected by the food \ncrisis in 2008 immediately cut back on the quality and consumption of food, and reduced or \neliminated expenditures for health, education, transport, and energy. Price increases in basic \ncommodities and school items have been greater in rural than in urban areas. This, in combination \nwith a perceived lower quality of education and health services in rural areas, triggers inward \nmigration to aimag centers and urban areas, which in turn creates the new vulnerable periurban \nger populations and creates double and triple shifting in many urban schools.  \n \n20.  Poverty has a significant impact on school attendance and school quality. The World Bank \nanalysis of the Living Standards Measurement Survey of 1998 and 2002 found that the negative \nimpact of poverty on school dropout rates is significant at every level of schooling\u2014even at \nprimary, where completion rates are normally close to universal\u2014and poverty has the largest effect \non upper secondary dropouts. Poverty affects children\u2019s educational outcomes directly (out-of-\npocket and opportunity costs) and indirectly (family or parental background). Even prior to the \n                                                 \n27  World Bank. 2006. Mongolia Country Poverty Assessment. Washington, DC. \n28 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Grants to Mongolia \nfor the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. Manila. \n ", "      7\nfinancial crisis, the costs of education to parents, including textbooks, stationery, school uniforms,29 \nand travel to school were major concerns (footnote 19). Repeated household and school surveys \nas well as FGDs confirm that textbooks are considered not only the most important determinant of \nstudent performance but are also the largest single cost that most parents incur in sending their \nchildren to school.30 Education may be unaffordable for families with more than one child of school \nage, migrants in Ulaanbaatar, single-parent households, and families in rural areas. Falling real \nwages and employment impede households' ability to provide adequate food and necessities. \nUnless mitigation measures are put in place, households may be forced to sell assets on which \ntheir livelihoods depend (in Mongolia, herders are reported to be selling livestock to cope with the \ncrisis), leading to the withdrawal of their children from school, and increasingly inadequate diets \nresulting eventually in malnutrition.31 FGDs and school survey findings reveal that while an increase \nin child labor is not likely due to limited employment opportunities, boys' absenteeism is on the rise \n(particularly during October and spring in rural areas when all hands are needed on the farm) and \nan increase is also reported in boys deciding to leave school early to find work in mines before jobs \nare taken by others. When poor children drop out from school, the risk that they will not return once \nthe crisis is over is significant, or that they will not be able to catch up with their peers because of \nlearning gaps resulting from lack of attendance. \n \n21.  Lack of Targeting in Current Education Programs. Currently, the Government provides \ntextbooks to 20% of students who are deemed poor. Administration of this targeting program is \nreported to be inefficient as some of the nonpoor access the free textbooks and coverage of the \npoor is low, with only 9% of poor students reported to have received free textbooks.32 Improving \nexisting targeting mechanisms and introducing new targeting approaches such as proxy means \ntesting (PMT) is necessary for the provision of textbooks and other education programs, in order to \nexpand coverage of the poor, reduce access of the nonpoor to these benefits, and prioritize \nexpenditure on education.  \n \n22.  Limited  Central  and  Local  Capacity  for  Planning  and  Management.  MECS  and \ndevelopment  partner  surveys  for  the  ongoing  review  of  the  ESMP  2006\u20132015  indicate  an \ninsufficient focus on the urgent need to improve and upgrade MECS capacity to plan, budget, \nmanage finances, provide relevant and accurate data, and monitor and evaluate the education \nsystem. The following recommendations were made as a result of the ESMP review: (i) Improve \nschool  and  institutional  budgeting  formula  to  adequately  address  the  diversity  of  school  and \ninstitutional situations. Norms-based budgeting may be administratively convenient but it does not \nmeet actual school requirements; a needs-based budgeting formula would be preferred. (ii) Focus \n                                                 \n29 For instance, school uniforms cost between MNT25,000 and MNT30,000 per child annually and because many \nfamilies have more than one child, uniforms are deemed costly. School uniforms are mandatory in primary and \nsecondary grades and teacher\u2013parent associations for each school select a design and fabric specifications for a \nuniform. The school then places the order for school uniforms with a supply company. Many school uniforms in \nMongolia are reported to be produced in the People\u2019s Republic of China, given that the local textile industry in \nMongolia is less developed. This increases the cost of uniforms. At the same time, 92% of teachers in the school \nsurvey and many parents in the focus group discussions were against abolishing school uniforms, arguing that buying \ncasual clothes for students would be more costly. Ways to lower the cost of uniforms and to improve the quality of \nuniforms need to sought by utilizing local producers, like women's cooperatives, therefore fostering linkages between \nthe labor market and the education sector.  \n30 The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2002/03) identifies textbooks as the highest expenditure item in \nhousehold spending on education, accounting for 46% of educational spending for primary education and 43% for \nsecondary. For the poorest segment of the population, textbook costs account for 59% of educational expenditures for \nprimary education and 58% for secondary education. \n31 World Bank. 2009.

(iii)  Obtain  reliable  data;  and  establish  an  effective,  accurate,  and  comprehensive \neducation  management  information  system  (EMIS).  While  experience  in  the  region  clearly \ndemonstrates positive linkages between school leadership and school performance, very little \nsupport is provided to aimag school principals and inspectors in management, leadership, school \ndevelopment, financial management, and school and community relationships. As a result of the \nGovernment\u2019s  current  education  reforms,  investment  in  building  the  capacity  of  education \nadministrators is needed. \n \n23.  Lack  of  Impact  Measurement,  and  Inadequate  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) system at MECS is not adequate and is not fully capable of \nsupporting its policy and planning function. A stronger M&E system is needed to understand the \noverall  impact  of  education  programs  on  student  achievement  and  to  determine  if  education \nprograms are reaching intended beneficiaries. Delivery of education programs such as school and \npreschool  meals  are  reportedly  inefficient  and  lacking  in  transparency.  Generally,  many \nperformance indicators for the education sector are unavailable, incomplete, or inconsistent, partly \nfor geographic and technical reasons. Current data collection from schools, baghs, soums, and \naimags  should  be  modified  to  profile  the  individual  (student).  Collection  of  individual  student \nrecords  would  allow  for  a  reconciliation  of  budgets,  an  important  condition  in  a  system \ncharacterized by large inflows of students from rural areas. Measuring the impact of education \nprograms  should  be  an  important  function  for  policy  and  planning,  particularly  in  light  of \nimplementation of the Government's flagship reform of shifting to the 12-year education system.  \n \n2.   Opportunities \n \n24.  Respond  Rapidly  to  Protect  Vulnerable  Groups  during  the  Financial  Crisis.  The \nGovernment has taken prompt action to steer the country back to recovery. Given the high rate of \npreschool enrollment among children from poor families in rural areas, the Government provides \nfree meals at preschools as part of its pro-poor strategy during the economic downturn and has \nrequested ADB  support  to  finance  these  meals.  Preschool  and  school  feeding  programs  are \nemerging as a common social safety net response to the global economic crisis. In 2008, 20 \ngovernment-administered school feeding programs were implemented as a safety net response to \nprotect  the  poorest.33 The  United  Nations  World  Food  Programme  assisted  some  22  million \nchildren with school feeding in 68 countries, and the World Bank Group\u2019s Global Food Crisis \nResponse Facility mobilized $1.2 billion to help countries respond to the food and fuel crises, \nincluding scaling up school feeding programs. Such programs have the potential to combat hunger, \nsupport nutrition, and provide an incentive for poor families to send their children to preschool\u2014\nand keep them there\u2014while improving their children\u2019s psychosocial and cognitive development. \nPrograms that support young children before they go to primary school provide strong foundations \nfor  subsequent  learning  and  development,  and  contribute  to  increased  primary  education \ncompletion rates.  \n \n25.  Maintain Education Quality during the Financial Crisis. Given declining budgets for \nschool operation and maintenance (O&M) and recurrent costs, the ability of schools to offer an \nenvironment conducive to learning has been hampered. To maintain quality of education and \nschool attendance rates during the financial crisis, schools in remote and disadvantaged areas \nneed  additional  support  to  cover  O&M  costs  including  for  heating,  electricity,  minor  repairs, \nmaintenance of computers and internet connection, and a minimum of learning materials. Boarding \nschools also need support to maintain minimum living and learning conditions for the children of \n                                                 \n33  World Bank. 2009.

Providing free textbooks targeted at secondary school students from poor families will \nhelp reduce parental costs for education and stimulate school attendance, particularly among boys. \n \n26.  Improve Targeting of Textbook Provision to the Poor. Through a related policy measure \nin  the  SSSP  loan,  MECS  will  implement  PMT  as  a  targeting  methodology  for  providing  free \ntextbooks to 40%34 of secondary school students. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour is \ndeveloping PMT under the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project (footnote 28). \nCurrently, Mongolia has no poverty-targeted programs. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour \nreform aims to consolidate welfare programs and improve targeting through PMT. The MECS \ninitiative to target textbooks under the Project is an extension of this reform and builds on the \nrelated reforms. The methodology for PMT is expected to be finalized by mid-2009 and a database \nof 400,000 poor households in Mongolia is expected to be prepared by mid-2010; it will be utilized \nfor the targeting of free textbooks starting in SY2010/11. This will ensure that those in need are the \ntrue beneficiaries of government programs aimed at reducing poverty in the country. \n \n27.  Improve Efficiency of Education Programs. FGDs with teachers, school administrators, \nand  parents  indicate  inefficiency  in  many  government  programs,  including  the  provision  of \ntextbooks,  and  school  and  preschool  meals.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  in \nstrengthening the delivery of meals at preschools and textbooks through enhanced central and \nlocal M&E. This will build a foundation for developing M&E in other government programs in \neducation, such as provision of dormitory meals.  \n \n28.  Strengthen  Education  Financing,  Budgeting,  and  Monitoring  and  Evaluation. The \nESMP review undertaken under the ADB-funded sectorwide approach TA identified the need to \nimprove capacity within MECS and aimags for planning, budgeting, and financial management; to \ndevelop a reliable and comprehensive EMIS; and to establish effective M&E systems for the \nMongolian education sector.   \n \n3.  Lessons  \n \n29.  Lessons on Education Sector Support during Financial Crises. A recent ADB study, \nGlobal Economic Crisis: Challenges for Developing Asia and ADB's Response,35 states that the \ncrisis is likely to increase child mortality, aggravate hunger and disease, increase school dropout \nrates, and decrease the likelihood of attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nstudy recommends supporting existing social safety nets or creating new ones despite expected \nshortfalls in government budget. Cutting children's programs as a consequence of fiscal tightening \nwill put the burden of the crisis on the most vulnerable members of the society. Lessons from two \nsocial  sector  protection  program  loans  provided  to  Indonesia  and  Thailand  during  the  1997 \neconomic crisis include the need to (i) develop a well-defined M&E system to identify program \nimpact on key indicators, (ii) develop directives for the use of block grant funds, and (iii) sustain \nproject implementation monitoring after project completion. The project design incorporates these \nlessons. \n \n30.  Lessons  from  ADB's  Education  Projects  in  the  Region. A recent ADB study36 that \nevaluated  the  implementation  of  ADB's  education  projects  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region \n                                                 \n34  The Government has provided free textbooks to 20% of students deemed poor since 2005. Given the anticipated \nimpacts of the financial crisis on families and their spending on education, the Cabinet of Ministers decided in May \n2009 to increase the free textbook provision from 20% to 40% to align it with the increasing poverty rate (35.2% in \n2009). The SSSP indicates that 20% of students in 2011 will continue to receive free textbooks and are targeted \nthrough the PMT. \n35  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", " 10 \nemphasizes the need to coordinate and link ADB projects to ensure coherence of the sector \nassistance strategy. An overview of synergies with other ADB-funded projects in Mongolia is in \nAppendix 4. The sector synthesis highlights the importance of strengthening institutional capacity \nand improving M&E, both of which are addressed under the Project (Appendix 5). \n \n31.  Project Rationale. The economic crisis and ensuing budgetary constraints are directly \naffecting the education sector, threatening to undermine achievements related to MDG targets in \neducation. The more immediate concerns affecting education during the crisis are increases in \nunemployment and a subsequent decrease in real incomes for parents and guardians, leading to \nreduced household expenditures for education including for school textbooks; increases in school \ndropout rates and in the number of out-of-school children especially from poor communities; and a \ndecline in the quality of learning environments. The deterioration of educational services in rural \nareas is one of the major reported causes of migration to the cities, which in turn places pressure \non urban educational institutions. The current financial and economic crisis can have a long-term \nimpact on the health and future productivity of vulnerable groups. Continuing access of the poor \nneeds to be ensured to (i) preschool education and good nutrition, (ii) secondary school textbooks \nas a result of improved and adequate targeting, and (iii) quality education supported by adequate \nO&M  funds.  Budgeting,  planning,  financial  management,  and  M&E  at  MECS  is  needed  to \nanticipate and mitigate future risks associated with budget constraints. The Project is in line with \nthe development agenda of inclusive economic growth in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)37 and ADB's global economic crisis response strategy of rebalancing \neconomies  and  providing  support  to  the  poor.38 The  Project  will  build  on  the  policy  platform \nestablished by previous projects and continue the reform agenda in tandem with the Government\u2019s \nESMP and National Development Strategy.  \n \n32.  Linkages with the Social Sectors Support Program Loan. The Project complements the \nSSSP loan approved on 24 June 2009 and effective as of 15 July 2009 that will support nationwide \npolicy  reforms  designed  to  maintain  access  of  the  poor  to  basic  social  services.  The  SSSP \ncontains the following policy measures related to the targeting of textbooks to secondary school \nstudents from poor families: (i) the Government, through MECS, will establish a working group to \nassess the implementation viability of PMT for textbooks (first tranche policy measure); and (ii) the \nGovernment, through MECS, will approve PMT-based eligibility for secondary school textbook \nsubsidies  (second  tranche  policy  measure).  Policy  measures  in  the  SSSP  will  provide  the \nfoundation for project implementation. The SSSP associated TA will provide 3 person-months of \ninternational consulting expertise to help MECS target textbooks. The first tranche under the SSSP \nwas disbursed in July 2009.  \n \n33.  The  Project  is  prepared  separately  from  the  SSSP  because  MECS  needs  support  to \noperationalize policy reforms, and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of education service \ndelivery.  Without  the  capacity  to  ensure  that  benefits  reach  the  intended  national  and  local \nbeneficiaries, policies will not achieve their objectives. Policies supported under the SSSP have \nimportant  medium-term  ramifications.  While  targeting  will  be  a  first  step  to  reduce  specific \neducation costs, other efficiency measures focus on effective delivery and monitoring systems, \nquality and durability of textbooks, quality and nutritional content of meals at preschools, and \nadequate O&M budgets to ensure minimum quality learning environments. While the SSSP will \ndetermine eligibility for PMT, the Project is a sector intervention that will support the Government in \naddressing short-term financing needs and maintaining longer-term policy reform in the education \nsector.  \n                                                 \n37  ADB. 2008.

The  impact  of  the  Project  will  ensure  that  access  to  and  quality  of  education  will  be \nmaintained and system efficiency further enhanced during the time of the economic and financial \ncrisis and thereafter. The outcome includes adequate financing of textbooks, meals at preschools, \nand school operation costs in SY2009/10 and SY2010/11; and improved efficiency of the education \nsystem. \n \nB.  Outputs \n35.  The  Project  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  provision  of  meals  at  preschools,  (ii)  targeted \nprovision of textbooks for secondary school students from poor families, (iii) provision of block \ngrants to schools including boarding schools in need of O&M funds, and (iv) national and local \ncapacity building. The outputs were derived through extensive consultation with the Government \nand a wide range of stakeholders, including from remote locations during school visits, school \nsurveys, and focus group meetings.  \n \n  1.  Component 1: Financing and Enhancing the Feeding Program at Preschools \n \n36.  Focusing on preschools, this component will (i) provide financing for the nationwide feeding \nprogram; (ii) improve the existing delivery mechanisms of meal provision to promote efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability; and (iii) support improvements in the quality and nutrition of \nmeals. The feeding program at preschools will benefit an estimated 150,000 children aged 2\u20135 \nduring SY2009/10 and SY2010/11 by providing a free feeding program. The Project will conduct a \nstudy to support the Government in improving the quality and nutritional value of meals; and will \nmake recommendations for improving the use of local food products where appropriate, enhancing \nthe quality and calorific content of food, and introducing local packaging of food products to meet \nthe  needs  of  children.  The  Project  will  review  implementation  of  meal  delivery  and  prepare \nguidelines to ensure the efficiency, transparency, and effective use of resources. The TA attached \nto the SSSP will support the Government in considering an appropriate targeting strategy for the \nprovision of meals at preschools in the medium term. While targeting individual students would not \nbe  appropriate,  a  combination  of  geographic  and  poverty-based  targeting  mechanisms  would \nassist the Government to better confront future crises when emergency funds are not readily \navailable.  International  consulting  services  will  set  up  the  monitoring  systems  for  project \ncomponents 1, 2, and 3, at the beginning of the Project to facilitate monitoring. \n \n  2.   Component 2: Targeted Textbook Provision for Poor Students \n \n37.  This component will (i) provide financing for the printing and production of free textbooks for \n40% of all students (grades 7\u201312) in secondary schools and targeted to students from poor \nfamilies; (ii) provide 74,000 teacher guides in all subjects for secondary grades; (iii) improve the \nexisting textbook delivery mechanisms to promote efficiency, transparency, and accountability by \nstrengthening monitoring of free textbook provision; (iv) review the possibility of reducing the \nnumber of textbook titles to ease the burden on the Government and parents, as well improving the \nquality  and  durability  of  textbooks  to  save  on  costs  and  support  textbook  loans  and  rental \nschemes; and (v) support the Government in implementing PMT for the efficient targeting of the \nfree textbook program. The TA attached to the SSSP will provide 3 person-months of international \nconsulting  services  to  assist  MECS  with  the  targeting  of  textbooks  and  to  consider  various \ntargeting methodologies including geographic targeting for other education programs. The Project \nwill support MECS to increase its capacity in targeting textbook provision in order to ensure \n ", " 12 \nefficient implementation of PMT even after project completion. In this regard, a two-step approach \nwill  be  put  in  place  before  introducing  PMT:  (i)  strengthen  and  utilize  the  existing  targeting \nmechanism in the first year of the Project (SY2009/10), and (ii) introduce PMT in SY2010/11. \nUnder this component, project activities will be coordinated with ESRP implementation, which \nincludes  provision  of  textbooks  for  primary  school  students,  and  reforms  in  developing  and \npublishing  textbooks.  An  overview  of  textbook  production  in  Mongolia  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n  3.   Component 3: Block Grants for Schools and Boarding Schools \n \n38.  The Project will provide block grants to selected schools including boarding schools to meet \nO&M costs during the financial downturn. These block grants aim to ensure effective, quicker, and \nmore transparent use of school resources and learning spaces. Priorities under block grants are for \nrecurrent costs that are a burden for schools and MECS. Items funded under block grants fall into \nfive categories: (i) heating, (ii) electricity, (iii) minor school maintenance, (iv) school materials (e.g., \nblackboards, whiteboards, chalk, markers), and (v) computer maintenance and internet connection. \nEligible  items,  criteria  for  identifying  and  selecting  eligible  schools,  and  guidelines  for  the \nadministration of block grants are in Appendix 6. The primary targets are schools that cater largely \nto poor children, selected through poverty screening. Block grants will be administered on a pilot \nbasis to 100 schools and boarding schools during the first year of the Project (SY2009/10) and will \nbe evaluated at the end of SY2009/10. If the pilot is deemed successful and after necessary \nrevisions have been made, it will be scaled up to an additional 220 schools and boarding schools \nin  SY2010/11.  The  Project  will  recruit  international  and  national  consultants  to  support  the \nGovernment in setting up procedures for administering and monitoring school block grants. The \nProject will draw on UNICEF's program of child-friendly schools in developing the guidelines for \nblock grant administration.   \n \n39.  The following safeguards will be built into the administration of block grants to ensure \ntransparency and effective utilization: (i) collaborative development of a block grant proposal by \nschool  committees,  to  nurture  school  ownership  and  school-based  decision  making;  \n(ii) development of guidelines for proposal development, procurement, and monitoring; (iii) regular \nmonitoring and public accountability and transparency of block grant use; (iv) midterm evaluation of \nthe  pilot  program;  and  (v)  development  of  training  modules  for  school  principals  in  financial \nmanagement. Consultants will monitor utilization of the block grants on a semiannual basis through \nschool  visits  and  interviews,  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability;  and  through  random \nschool visits and interviews to audit school eligibility, selection process, and block grant activities \nbased on the school proposal. To raise awareness among schools regarding block grants, the \nProject will disseminate information through various channels (e.g., radio, government channels, \nvillage notice boards, and nongovernment organizations).  \n \n  4.   Component 4: Capacity Building \n \n40.  Overall, the Project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of MECS to enable it to \nimprove  planning,  management,  delivery  of  education  services,  and  implementation  of  SSSP \npolicies. Capacity building under the Project includes two subcomponents. \n \n41.  Strengthen  Budgeting,  Planning,  and  the  Management  Information  System.  The \nProject will support the Government in evaluating and preparing a comprehensive policy matrix for \nenhancing budget efficiency and financial management. Support will include (i) reviewing the \neffectiveness  of  the  current  budgeting  formula  in  addressing  the  needs  of  different  types  of \nschools, (ii) developing a policy and action plan for providing an adequate O&M budget for schools \nthrough consultation with stakeholders and schools, (iii) conducting a training and capacity needs \n ", "     13\nassessment and improvement plan for education planning and budgeting (iv) strengthening the \nM&E system at MECS to enable quarterly reporting on O&M spending, (v) conducting an education \nexpenditure review (after 1 year of project implementation), and (vi) strengthening planning and \nbudgeting processes through staff training at MECS.  \n \n42.  The Project will foster coordinated action among development partners by establishing a \nmultistakeholder M&E technical group to develop comprehensive sectorwide approaches to M&E. \nThe Project will provide international consulting inputs to provide initial guidance to the technical \ngroup, which can be supported by all development partners and will contribute to development of a \nsectorwide approach in Mongolia's education sector. The Project will support the Government in \ndeveloping a comprehensive and consultative policy on an EMIS, including identifying (i) key \nperformance indicators in the sector; (ii) user requirements; (iii) data collection needs, tools, and \nmethodologies; (iv) the functions of an EMIS; and (v) lines of responsibilities for central, provincial, \nand school information collection, analysis, management, and planning. The Project will ensure \ncomplementarity of capacity building inputs in budgeting and the EMIS with those under the ESRP. \nIn addition, the Project will support the Government in strengthening the sector by financing \nresearch studies on (i) food quality at preschools, (ii) textbook durability and cost reduction, (iii) \ngreater  community  and  parental  involvement  in  school  management,  and  (iv)  cost  reduction \nstrategies for school uniforms. \n \n43.  The  Project  will  support  a  monitoring  system  that  will  solicit  feedback  from  parents, \nnongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations on how meals at preschools \nand free textbook programs are effectively reaching intended beneficiaries. Such monitoring will \nbuild upon existing parent associations and user satisfaction surveys that would be useful for \nindividual  schools,  and  for  district  and  national  planning  decisions  and  monitoring.  Specific \nactivities for community involvement will be developed based on the findings of the feasibility study \non  greater  community  and  parental  involvement  in  school  management  (para.  42). Fostering \ncommunity  participation  enhances  ownership,  sustainability  of  benefits,  transparency,  and \naccountability; and contributes to the cultivation of child-friendly schools.  \n \n44.  Train School Principals and Supervisors. School capacity will be developed by providing \ninteractive  training  modules  and  piloting  modules  for  aimag  principals  and  inspectors.  This \nsubcomponent will strengthen skills in the areas of financial management, community and parental \ninvolvement, managing and motivating teachers, formative and summative evaluation, continuous \nprofessional staff development, and building a school community. The training will foster a greater \nsense of ownership and more proactive roles of schools. The interactive training modules will be \ndeveloped to overcome the disadvantage of distance and harsh weather during winter, which make \nface-to-face training costly. The Project will train staff in education and culture departments who in \nturn will train school principals on the use of interactive training modules. \n \nC.  Special Features \n45.  Rapid Response to Maintain Education Quality and  Enrollment. The Project is an \nimmediate response to budget constraints in education and to challenges for households to meet \neducation costs during the economic and financial crisis. Free feeding programs and provision of \ntextbooks  and  instructional  materials  to  students  from  poor  families  help  maintain  school \nattendance rates by reducing parental costs for education. To maintain the quality of learning \nenvironments  in  schools  serving  disadvantaged  student  populations, block  grants  will  provide \nfunding for O&M, including for heating, electricity, essential school repairs and learning materials, \nmaintenance of information and communication technology investments, and internet connection.  \n \n ", " 14 \n46.  Capacity  Building  to  Improve  Efficiency  of  the  Education  Sector.  In  addition  to \naddressing short-term needs during the economic downturn, the Project supports medium- to long-\nterm  institutional  reform  and  capacity  development  for  national  and  local  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement,  M&E,  community  involvement,  and  school  leadership.  The  Project  will  support \nMECS in preparing a comprehensive EMIS policy and a monitoring system that includes O&M \nbudget reporting, conducting research studies for improving the management and efficiency of the \neducation sector, and reducing parental costs for education.  \n \n47.  Enhancing and Expanding Targeting Support. The Project and the education-related \npolicy measures in the SSSP provide a basis for reform in the education sector to ensure pro-poor \ntargeted and efficient development of education. The strengthening of textbook targeting that \nsupports a pro-poor focus will benefit those who are most in need and address long-term human \ndevelopment by ensuring that education services are protected during the global economic crisis.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n48.  The project investment cost is estimated at $26.36 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, and no taxes and duties (the Project will be exempt). The cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 7. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

Price contingencies are computed at an annual \naverage of 0.8% on foreign exchange costs and 8.1% on local currency costs; with an adjustment for potential \nexchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing-power-parity exchange rate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Project Financing Plan \n49.  The Government has requested a grant of $17,000,000 equivalent from ADB's Special \nFunds  resources,  representing  64.5%  of  the  total  project  cost.  In 2009,  the  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $9.36 million equivalent or 35.5% of the total project cost as counterpart \nfinancing for feeding programs at preschools and textbooks. The financing plan is summarized in \nTable 2 and detailed in Appendix 7. Grant financing of the Project is considered justified because \nof  its  focus  on  preschool,  primary,  and  secondary  education  to  ensure  continued  school \n ", "     15\nparticipation and educational achievement. Moreover, part of the investment is targeting students \nin poor and remote areas. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  17.00    64.5 \nGovernment of Mongolia    9.36     35.5 \nTotal  26.36  100.0 \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n50.  MECS will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The implementation structure will be \nbased  on  project  implementation  arrangements  established  under  the  ESDP  and  later  used \nsuccessfully for the Second Education Development Project and the TEDP, and now for the ESRP. \nThe project steering committee (PSC) established under ESRP will assume the role of the PSC \nunder this Project and provide overall guidance and coordination for Project implementation. The \nchair of the PSC, with the concurrence of the existing PSC members may appoint, as required, \nrepresentatives of other relevant agencies as new PSC members. The PSC will meet quarterly and \nbe responsible for (i) approving the annual Project budget and activity plan, and (ii) reviewing and \nadvising on implementation progress. The Project implementation unit (PIU) responsible for the \ndaily operation of the ADB-financed Third Education Development Project (TEDP) will serve as the \nPIU  for  the  Project.  The  PIU  will  oversee  and  manage  project  implementation,  including  the \nprocurement, recruitment of consulting services and disbursement activities. Five new PIU staff will \nbe  recruited,  including  a  deputy  project  manager,  a  procurement  officer,  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation specialist, an accountant, and an education specialist. The procurement capacity of \nMECS was assessed and found to be adequate. MECS has extensive implementation experience \nthrough the TEDP PIU, which has been in place since the mid-1990s. Staff is experienced in \nprocurement, consultant recruitment, and overall project implementation. The PIU will report to the \nproject  director  and  provide  quarterly  results-based  progress  reports  to  the  PSC,  MECS \nmanagement,  and  ADB.  The  MECS  procurement  capacity  assessment  report  and \nrecommendations are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n51.  The Project will be implemented over 2.5 years, tentatively from October 2009 to March \n2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n52.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Goods, services, and works \nestimated to cost the equivalent of less than $100,000 will be procured using ADB's shopping \nprocedure. Goods and services with an estimated value of less than $500,000 and works with an \nestimated value of less than $500,000 will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) \nprocedures. To procure items costing less than $10,000, the PIU may purchase the items directly \nfrom the supplier. In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. NCB \nprocurement will be carried out on the basis of NCB procedures, in accordance with the Mongolian \n ", " 16 \nProcurement Law, subject to modifications agreed with ADB. For NCB, the first draft English \nlanguage version of the procurement documents should be submitted for ADB review and approval \nregardless of the estimated contract amount. The ADB-approved procurement documents should \nthen be used as a model for all NCB procurement financed by ADB for the Project, and need not \nbe subjected to further prior review. ADB will review the bid evaluation report and award of contract \non a postreview basis. For shopping, ADB will review the award of the contract on a postreview \nbasis.  MECS  will  develop  distribution  systems  for  textbooks  and  learning  materials  that  are \nacceptable to ADB and will ensure transparent distribution of these goods to project beneficiaries, \nbefore disbursing the project funds for these items. Procurement of new textbooks will be carried \nout through NCB and procurement of textbooks already approved by MECS will be carried out \nthrough  direct  contracting  and  shopping.39 All  secondary  textbooks  and  teacher  guides  to  be \nprocured and funded by the Project must be approved by MECS and undergo a cost review by an \nexternal  textbook  costing  consultant.  All  prices  must  include  the  costs  of  raw  materials  and \nmanufacturing, packing, delivery, and storage to and within aimag centers. All titles selected for \nprocurement and funding must be accompanied by a statement from the copyright owners that \nthey own the copyright and that the Government and ADB are fully indemnified against all claims \nfor breach of copyright that might arise from the supply of the textbooks and teacher guides to \nsecondary schools in Mongolia. School leadership software will be procured separately using \ninternational  competitive  bidding;  the  package  will  include  consulting  inputs,  preparation  and \ntranslation of e-modules, and training. Funds for meals at preschools will be disbursed to MECS, \nwhich will provide funds for meals to preschools based on its existing disbursement procedures \nand on preschool per capita data. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9.  \n \n53.  Advance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB  has  approved  advance \ncontracting to expedite the award of contracts for textbook provision and recruitment of consultants \ndue to an urgent need to provide textbooks to schools before the start of the school year in \nSeptember  2009.  Specifically,  ADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  a  consulting  firm  and \nindividual consultants in (i) block grant delivery; (ii) textbook procurement; and (iii) M&E, given the \nneed to avoid start-up delays, the urgent need to commence the Project before the start of the \nschool  year  on  1  September  2009,  and  the  short  duration  of  the  Project.  For  the  advance \ncontracting  for  textbook  provision,  the  TEDP  PIU  will  send  all  bidding  documents  and  bid \nevaluation reports to ADB for review and approval prior to approval of the grant. MECS capacity to \nundertake advance contracting was assessed as adequate. The MECS procurement capacity \nassessment  report  and  recommendations  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  requested \nretroactive financing is for eligible expenditures of up to $1 million (equivalent to 5.8% of the ADB \ngrant)  incurred  in  relation  to  purchase  of  textbooks  and  recruitment  of  consultants  within  a \nmaximum of 12 months before the signing of the Grant Agreement. The Government was advised \nthat approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n54.  The Project will require a total of 31 person-months of international consulting services and \n75 person-months of national consulting services financed under the ADB grant. Consultants will \nbe recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). ADB will select consultants as a consulting firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, using the quality- and cost-based selection method (90% quality and 10% \ncost) and a simplified technical proposal. The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because \n                                                 \n39  MECS adopted a new policy on textbook production in April 2009. The policy of competing alternative textbooks has \nbeen abandoned in favor of a system of a single (uniform) textbook for each subject. This is in response to widespread \ncomplaints from parents about the additional costs involved, particularly when students transfer from one school to \nanother where different textbooks have been selected for use.  \n ", "     17\nthe Project focuses on building capacity of the education sector to mitigate and anticipate the \nimpacts of the financial and economic crisis, and to monitor implementation of project components. \nAt the same time, the quality of the consulting services will have a high impact on the ensuing \npolicies  and  guidelines,  and  the  monitoring  of  project  implementation.  ADB  will  select  the \nconsulting firm given (i) the urgent need to field the consulting firm, (ii) the need to ensure high-\nquality consulting inputs given the short duration of the Project (2.5 years), and (iii) the need to \nbuild MECS capacity to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. MECS retains the responsibility for \nengaging  the  firm,  signing  the  contract,  and  supervising  the  consultants'  services.  Advance \ncontracting  will  include  advertisement  of  the  positions,  review  and  evaluation  of  shortlisted \nconsulting  firms  on  a  competitive  basis,  and  clearance  of  the  evaluation  and  the  proposed \nselection. A simplified technical proposal will be used to expedite selection and fielding of the \nconsulting firm. The international and national consultants will have expertise in (i) education \nfinance, management, and planning; (ii) textbook provision systems; (iii) school leadership; (iv) \nchild nutrition and early childhood education; (v) central and local M&E; and (vi) administration of \nschool block grants. Indicative consultancy requirements are in Appendix 10 and outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix G. MECS will provide suitably furnished \noffices  with  utilities  and  telecommunication  access,  and  necessary  documents  and  data  as \nrequired by the Project. MECS will also designate a professional focal person for the project \ncomponents (preschools, textbooks, and budgeting and finance) to work closely and facilitate the \nwork  of  the  consultants.  Capacity  building  for  MECS  and  the  PIU  will  be  achieved  through \nconsultant inputs; training courses provided by universities, specialized institutes, and firms; and \nacquisition of additional equipment financed from the grant.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n55.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n56.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through the timely release of \ngrant proceeds, the PIU will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things, \nthat goods and/or services are (i) procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB \nfinancing. The maximum amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed the \nestimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish \nindividual payments that do not exceed $50,000. In addition, grant funds will be disbursed using \ndirect payment to the consultants. The block grants will be disbursed directly from the Project's \nimprest account to the beneficiary schools\u2019 accounts. Eligible items are in Appendix 6. Block grants \nwill not exceed $10,000 per school and will be monitored through the summary of expenditure, \nbased on the agreements with beneficiary schools in the form of a simplified funding proposal. All \n ", " 18 \nthe items to be procured under block grants are locally available, are relatively inexpensive, and \nwill be procured on an irregular basis by beneficiary schools.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n57.  The Government, through the PIU, will (i) maintain separate cash-basis financial accounts \nfor the Project in accordance with national accounting standards, and (ii) have such accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in \naccordance  with  the  provision  of  the  Grant  Agreement  and  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.40 The auditors should have qualifications, experience, and \nterms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of \nexpenditures will be part of the annual audit and a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The \nGovernment will submit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial \nstatements and the related reports to auditors, within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year \n(with the exception of 2009 during which only 2 months of implementation are expected). For the \npurpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial  statements,  the \nproceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for private financial statements, sector \nauditors,  and  translation  of  auditor\u2019s  reports  into  English.  The  PIU  will  submit  consolidated \nquarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the Government on all aspects of project \nimplementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  of  overall  implementation  progress,  problems \nencountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to remedy these problems, \nand  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  following  quarter.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion, the PIU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project \ncompletion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the grant; (ii) performance of the Project; (iii) \neconomic and social benefits generated; and (iv) details about implementation, costs, and other \ninformation requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n58.  MECS will establish a comprehensive project performance management system acceptable \nto ADB. The system will (i) assess project performance; (ii) evaluate delivery of planned activities; \n(iii) measure project impacts; (iv) measure education, social, and economic benefits, focusing on \ndisadvantaged students from poor, remote, and rural areas; and (v) monitor progress toward the \nMDGs and other government targets. Project performance management system indicators will \nserve as a basis for reports on project implementation and progress toward the MDGs. Some \nindicators will be monitored by routine administrative and financial data. Where feasible, indicators \nwill be disaggregated by socioeconomic level and gender. The M&E consultant will assist MECS \nand the PIU to determine project-specific indicators, and to develop a cost-effective and efficient \nM&E system before project implementation.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n59.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake reviews of the Project at least once a year. \nThe  reviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and \ndetermine necessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted during \nthe  second  year  of  implementation.  It  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements;  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  implementation  progress  against \nperformance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements, if necessary.  \n \n                                                 \n40  ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n ", "     19\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n60.  Benefits. The Project will benefit an estimated 150,000 children ages 2\u20135 by providing a \nfree feeding program. In addition, about 100,000 students from low-income families will benefit \nfrom receiving free secondary textbooks in SY2009/10 and SY2010/11. Secondary school teachers \nwill benefit from 74,000 teacher guides to be provided under the Project. Approximately 750 school \nprincipals will benefit from the training modules in school leadership and management. More than \n300  schools  and  boarding  schools  with  approximate  enrollments  of  150,000  are  expected  to \nbenefit from the block grants. The most significant economic benefit will come from preventing \nmalnutrition among vulnerable and at-risk children, and maintaining current school enrollment and \nsimultaneously preventing an increase in school dropout rates by providing essential learning \nmaterials such as textbooks targeted at poor students. Reforms will also improve the targeting of \ngovernment subsidies to the poor. Capacity building under the Project will include enhancing the \nefficiency  of  budgeting and  financial  management  in  education,  in the  context  of  the  current \nfinancial crisis and beyond, and improving M&E to enhance transparency and efficiency of public \nspending in education.  \n \n61.  Social Aspects. The initial social and poverty impact analysis identifies several key areas \nwhere the Project will benefit the poor and disadvantaged groups. The Project will have a direct \nbeneficial impact on about 250,000 students in preschools, and primary and secondary schools. At \nleast two thirds of the beneficiaries will be children from poor families. Specific pro-poor and social \ndevelopment measures of the Project include (i) targeting textbook provision to children from poor \nfamilies,  (ii) enhancing  access  to  preschools  by  children  from  poor  families,  (iii)  encouraging \ncommunity and parental involvement in schools, and (iv) providing block grants for schools serving \ndisadvantaged student populations. The Project was designed through a participatory process. \nDuring implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities, \nincluding civil society organizations, nongovernment organizations, and parent associations. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \n62.  Ethnic  Minority  Issues.  No  negative  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  expected. \nTargeting approaches under the SSSP will be applied nationwide and benefit indigenous peoples. \nThe poverty and social analysis during project preparation confirms that no negative impacts on \nindigenous peoples will occur.  \n \n63.  Gender  Aspects.  Poverty  is  a  larger  factor  than  gender  for  education  participation. \nMongolia has reverse gender disparity as girls outnumber boys in schools in every aimag and in \nUlaanbaatar. The disparity between boys and girls is highest in rural areas where dropout rates for \nboys are much higher than for girls. Boys are expected to undertake herder roles, while families \nencourage and support girls to enter education as a means of providing for themselves. The \npoverty and social analysis conducted during project preparation included gender analysis. Access \nto education is not simply a women's issue; parent involvement in education is important and \nneeds to be encouraged and monitored. The Project will ensure that both girls and boys benefit \nfrom project interventions, and that parent associations are involved in developing block grant \nproposals. A gender action plan is in Appendix 12.  \n \n64.  Environmental Aspects, Land Acquisition, and Resettlement. The Project entails no \nnew construction. The Project will not have any adverse environmental impact and is classified as \nenvironment category C. No civil works is envisaged under the Project, and the poverty and social \nanalysis  confirms  that  no  involuntary  resettlement  is  likely  to  occur.  With  no  planned  land \nacquisition, the Project is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy.  \n \n ", " 20 \n65.  Risks. At present, MECS\u2019s managerial and technical capacity in strategic planning and \nM&E  is  limited.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  training  and  capacity  building  in  finance, \nbudgeting, planning, and M&E; and development of a comprehensive EMIS policy. ADB will work \nclosely with the Government to ensure that sound budgeting and financial management practices \nare developed and followed in the education sector, targeting mechanisms are introduced and/or \nstrengthened, and appropriate assurances are included. Implementation of textbook provision and \na  feeding  program  at  preschools  requires  proper  governance  and  synchronization  of  central, \nprovincial, and local efforts and activities.  \n \n66.  Governance risks in the provision of meals at preschools, targeting of textbooks, and block \ngrants will be addressed by providing clear operating guidelines for monitoring implementation of \nrelevant project components. Related risks include the following: (i) The risk posed by the limited \nprocurement  capacity  of  the  education  sector  will  be  mitigated  by  ensuring  complementarity \nbetween the Project and the ADB-funded subproject Support for the Implementation of the Sector \nRisk Assessment in the Education Sector financed by the Governance Cooperation Fund.41 The \nsubproject aims to mitigate procurement and corruption risks through sector procurement and \nanticorruption priority interventions and enhancement of MECS institutional and staff capacity.42 (ii) \nThe  Government  has  no  previous  experience  in  administering  block  grants.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated by ensuring participatory design in developing guidelines for the administration of block \ngrants, a strong monitoring framework, and a pilot approach that will include a midterm evaluation \nof the pilot and its scaling up if deemed successful. Rigorous monitoring planned under the Project \nis to be institutionalized at MECS after project completion. The governance risk assessment and \nmanagement plan is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n67.  Another risk is the financial sustainability of project interventions. Although ADB does not \nsupport untargeted subsidies, provision of universal free meals during the financial crisis is justified \ngiven the evidence from the World Bank's Global Food Crisis Program and United Nations World \nFood Programme confirming the critical value of effective safety nets during the food and economic \ncrises. After completion of the Project, provision of meals at preschools will be refined to target \nthose who are most vulnerable. The TA attached to the SSSP will help MECS evaluate various \ntargeting approaches including geographic targeting, for programs such as meals at preschools. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government  through  consulting  services  to  institutionalize  newly \nadopted administrative arrangements for utilizing PMT in the targeting of textbooks, to improve \nefficiency, and to lower administrative costs of education delivery. The concept of block grants is \nnew in Mongolia, and is intended to address declining O&M budgets and the need to maintain \nminimum learning environments during the financial crisis. Block grants will be administered on a \npilot  basis  and  be  evaluated  during  the  midterm  review.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  pilot \nassessment, a medium-term plan with costing will be prepared for the Government's consideration.  \n \n                                                 \n41  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Support for Implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan. Manila. \n42  Under this subproject, procurement-related outputs include (i) review of education sector organization structure, and \nprocurement procedures and guidelines (e.g., procuring textbooks); and provision of advice to increase transparency \nand efficiency; (ii) procurement training needs assessment for MECS and its line organizations specifying national and \nprovincial staff categories and training programs; (iii) procurement training and capacity building for different staff \ncategories in MECS and its agencies as identified in the training needs assessment; and (iv) preparation of a plan to \nsustain institutional capacity building for MECS. The subproject\u2019s anticorruption activities include (i) reviewing the \nexisting MECS anticorruption action plan, and proposing effective mechanisms and procedures for implementation, \nmonitoring, and evaluation; (ii) supporting MECS in developing its new anticorruption action plan 2009\u20132010; (iii) \nreviewing the most recent code of ethics for civil servants, designing a code of ethics for the education sector, and \nproposing enforcement mechanisms; (iv) designing a training program on ethics, anticorruption, and anticorruption \naction plans; and providing sectorwide training, seminars, and workshops; and (v) developing and publishing manuals \nand/or guidelines on anticorruption, Ministerial Anti-Corruption Action Plan, and ethics for the education sector to \nensure project sustainability. \n ", "     21\n68.  Assumptions. Major project assumptions are (i) education and education sector reform \ncontinue to be a Government priority, and the Government limits budget cuts during the economic \nand financial crisis; (ii) the financial and economic crisis does not worsen; (iii) provision of free \nmeals will continue as an incentive for enrolling children in preschools; (iv) school block grants will \nbe utilized efficiently and will lead to improvement in the learning environment; (v) there is enough \ncommitment  to  capacity  building  at  local  levels;  and  (vi)  full  involvement  of  local  school \nmanagement in the design of future sector plans and reforms. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Provide all necessary counterpart funds for project implementation on time. The \nGovernment  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriate funds. \n(ii)  Ensure proper and timely achievement, adoption, compliance, and implementation \nof PMT for the targeted provision of textbooks for secondary schools starting in \nSY2010/11.  \n(iii)  Ensure monitoring of the effectiveness of the free feeding program at preschools \nand targeting of secondary textbooks prior to the implementation of PMT. \n(iv)  Promptly  discuss  with  ADB  problems  and  constraints  encountered  during \nimplementation of the Project and appropriate measures to overcome or mitigate \nsuch problems and constraints. \n(v)  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MECS  will  have  approved  a \ncomprehensive policy on education budgeting, planning, EMIS development, and \nM&E; and will have prepared a time-bound action plan for the implementation of \nthese policies.  \n(vi)  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MECS  will  have  approved  policy  for \nimproving delivery, quality, and monitoring of preschool meals. \n(vii)  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MECS  will  have  approved  policy  for \nimproving delivery, quality, and monitoring of textbooks. \n(viii)  Within 9 months of grant effectiveness, MECS will (a) conduct a textbook cost \nreduction study, and (b) conduct a research study on the cost-effective delivery of \nhigh-quality feeding programs to preschools.  \n(ix)  Take necessary measures to ensure provision of adequate budget allocations to the \neducation sector during the financial crisis.  \n(x)  Ensure that (a) a policy and an action plan providing an adequate O&M budget for \nschools  will  be  developed  within  6  months  of  grant  effectiveness  through \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  schools;  (b)  a  training  and  capacity  needs \nassessment and improvement plan for education planning and budgeting will be \nprepared within 6 months of grant effectiveness; (c) the MECS M&E system will be \nstrengthened to report quarterly on O&M spending; such reports will be submitted to \nADB on a semiannual basis throughout the project implementation; (d) an education \nexpenditure review will be conducted by midterm review (after 1 year of project \nimplementation); and (e) the planning and budgeting processes will be strengthened \nthrough staff training at MECS under the capacity building component of the Project.  \n(xi)  Ensure that block grants will be administered on a pilot basis in the first year of the \nProject (SY2009/10). The pilot will be evaluated at midterm review and based on the \nresults of the pilot implementation of block grants, the pilot will be scaled up if \nsuccessful; or revised for further pilot implementation; or if unsuccessful, alternative \nsolutions may be considered. \n ", " 22 \n(xii)  Ensure that the gender action plan agreed under the Project will be implemented in \na timely manner.  \n \nVI.

Structure of the Education System \n \n1.  The 12-year education structure was introduced into schools in September 2008 to \nreplace the 11-year structure introduced in 2005. The new structure (primary: grades 1\u20136, lower \nsecondary: grades 7\u201310, and upper secondary: grades 11\u201312) will align Mongolia with an \nincreasing number of former socialist countries now opting for 12-year systems. About 37,404  \n6-year-olds joined the formal education system in 2008. Primary and lower secondary education \nis compulsory. In 2008/09, 90.6% of children in the primary school age group were enrolled in \nprimary schools.  \n \n2.  In  2008/09,  Mongolia  had  748  general  education  schools  with  a  total  of  532,058 \nstudents. Of the 748 schools, 207 were in Ulaanbaatar and the remaining were located in \naimags. Of the total, 153 schools were primary schools only. According to the Ministry of \nEducation, Culture and Science (MECS), 25,543 full-time teachers were employed in general \neducation schools. The average teacher to student ratio is 25.5.1 In 2006/07, 479 teacher \npositions were vacant; most were in Ulaanbaatar schools. In most schools Mongolian is the \nlanguage of instruction; the Bayan-Olgiy primary schools also offer instruction in the Kazakh \nlanguage. In 2008/09, the 493 boarding schools enrolled 42,064 students (about 8% of the \noverall student population), of which 36,786 are herders\u2019 children.  \n \nB.  Challenges and Constraints  \n \n3.  Despite progress made in the education sector, Mongolia continues to face challenges in \nthe provision of quality education from preschool to higher education. A significant proportion of \nchildren in rural areas still do not attend primary or secondary school.2 In the countryside, 8% of \nall children aged 7\u201315 have never enrolled in school, 19% drop out before completing grade 8, \nonly 55% of students (45% in rural areas) complete upper secondary education, and gaps \nbetween rural and urban students in performance on achievement tests and progression rates \nare significant. Improving net enrollment rates in rural areas remains a challenge.3 Rural\u2013urban \nmigration has brought new challenges to the education sector, substantially increasing demand \nfor school services in urban centers. Some rural schools are now operating below capacity as a \nresult of outflows from their catchment areas.  \n \n4.  The migration from rural to urban areas presents challenges to MECS. In remote rural \nareas, MECS has to contend with decreasing enrollment and rising per capita costs, while in \nurban areas, notably in Ulaanbaatar, internal migration is placing considerable pressure on \nschool infrastructure. Many schools now operate in shifts. Pupil\u2013teacher ratios are on the rise. \n \n5.  The Constitution stipulates free basic education to all children, but many formal and \ninformal costs act as barrier to access. Poverty has a significant impact on school attendance. \nEven prior to the financial crisis, the costs of education, including textbooks, stationery, school \nuniforms, and travel to school, were major concerns for parents. Surveys show that textbooks \nare the highest household expenditure item for education. For the poorest segment of the \npopulation, textbook costs account for more than 50% of education expenditures. In theory, the \n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007.

Washington, DC.  \n ", " 28  Appendix 2 \nGovernment of Mongolia (the Government) provides textbooks to 20% of students deemed \npoor. However, both coverage and targeting are reported to be poor. Only 9% of students report \nreceiving free textbooks and access of the nonpoor to free books is significant. \n \n6.  In addition to finding ways of reducing financial barriers to education, MECS has to \nconsider reforming the curriculum and teaching methods. Mongolia began a standards-based \ncurriculum reform in 1998 and began standardized testing a year later. New state education \nstandards were introduced in 2003. These emphasize student-centered learning methodologies \nand the importance of developing higher order thinking skills\u2014learning how to know, learning \nhow to perform, and learning how to socialize and be a good citizen. General subject areas \ninclude  science,  technology,  and  English.  While  these  standards  are  consistent  with  the \nacquisition of skills needed for work and life, the current curriculum and teaching practices are \nnot consistent with these goals. The redesign of the curriculum as the basis for the 12-year \nsystem is still in process and in 2009 new syllabi and new textbooks were completed for primary \ngrades 1 and 2.  \n \n7.  The school curriculum and teaching methods have not kept up with new demands in the \nlabor market. The curriculum continues to be by rote, too theoretical, and focused on traditional \nacademic subjects, while teaching continues to be teacher-centered rather than interactive. \nClassroom instruction encourages memorization rather than critical and creative thinking, and \nindividual learning rather than teamwork. While information and communication technologies \n(ICT) and English language subjects are part of the curriculum, teachers are generally ill-\nequipped to teach these subjects. In many cases, the teaching of ICT is limited by the lack of \ncomputers in schools and inadequate operating budgets, which are widely unable to finance ICT \nconsumables, additional electricity costs, maintenance and servicing charges, and the costs of \ninternet  connection.  Schools  also  have  a  serious  shortage  of  relevant  e-materials  in  the \nMongolian language. Thinking and behavioral skills can be integrated into every aspect of the \ncurriculum  through  discovery-oriented  teaching  methods  that  include  interactive  learning, \napplying  knowledge  to  real-life  problems,  integrating  teamwork  and  peer  tutoring  into  the \nlearning process, and inviting student input into the structure and subject matter of lessons. \nHowever, these methodologies require well-trained teachers and adequate classroom facilities \nto make them effective in terms of delivering new education outputs. \n \n8.  The implementation of student-centered learning will take time and require substantial \ninvestments in pre- and in-service training. In the short run, teaching life skills as a separate \nsubject (e.g., health, citizenship, and financial literacy) may be a more practical option. To \nimprove teaching, teachers should also have adequate materials and should conduct routine \nformative and summative assessments of student progress, focusing on their ability to use the \nknowledge  acquired.  The  Government  is  currently  working  on  the  development  of  such  a \nnational assessment system for primary education.  \n \n9.  Although social transfer programs to support textbooks and basic school supplies to \npoor and vulnerable children and school feeding programs are significant initiatives, they are not \nperceived by either parents or teachers to be efficient, well targeted, or transparent. There is a \nwidespread demand from both parents and teachers for significant improvement in the targeting \nand  fiscal  efficiency  of  these  programs.  Prior  to  the  current  financial  crisis,  primary  and \nsecondary schools were widely considered to be underfunded in terms of recurrent operating \nbudget.  This  situation  worsened  with  the  2009  budget  cuts,  which  resulted  in  significant \ncutbacks in school activities and services, as well as learning and teaching opportunities for \nstudents,  which  seriously  undermine  education  quality.  Many  schools  are  now  routinely \nrequesting parental contributions to fill the operating funding gaps, which further add to the \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \nspending of households on education, particularly for poor and vulnerable parents who are \nmeant to be protected by the social transfers. Conversely, the funding required to support social \ntransfers to provide support for the poorest students also represents funding diverted away from \nother education uses, including additional operating budget support, which stimulates further \nrequests for additional parental contributions to school operating costs. Thus, in a very real \nsense, the social transfers are at least partially funded by increased parental contributions to \nschool operating costs.  \n \n10.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Education Sector Development Project4 \nundertook systematic restructuring of education institutions. The project aimed to improve the \nefficiency and cost-effectiveness of the education system during the 1990s, the most severe \nperiod  of  transition.  In  the  mid-1990s  school  attendance  was  poor,  many  schools  were \ndysfunctional, and teachers were not paid for months (at that time the maximum monthly salary \nwas MNT24,500).5 A nationwide school mapping study was completed in April 1997 and a plan \nwas  prepared  for  comprehensive  school  rationalization.  Of  the  171  schools  identified  for \nrestructuring, 136 (80%) were restructured by August 1998 and 35 (20%) by June 2002. One of \nthe major outputs was the development of \u201ccomplex schools,\u201d a rationalization initiative that \nbrought several adjacent neighborhood schools under common management. In 2007, about \n20% of students and 21% of teachers and school service staff of Ulaanbaatar were in complex \nschools. The model is now considered to be a blueprint for the development of primary and \nsecondary education services in urban areas, as these schools generally have more efficient \nmanagement and better facilities than other schools. However, rural students no longer have \nequal access to upper secondary education. A number of rural schools closed their upper \nsecondary classes during the 1997 school reorganization and rationalization reform; aimag \ncomplex schools have only limited numbers of upper secondary spaces. An assessment of the \noutcomes from the rationalization and reorganization reform suggests that these reforms may \nhave perpetuated the widening gaps in education outcomes between urban (aimag centers and \ncapital city) and rural (soum and bagh) schools, exacerbated the problems of access to senior \nsecondary education, and possibly contributed to migration from rural areas.  \n \nC.  Crosscutting Issues \n \n11.  The following crosscutting issues apply in more than one subsector of the education \nsystem.   \n \n12.  Budgeting. In preschools, and primary and secondary schools, (as well as nonformal \neducation and technical and vocational education), the norms-based budgeting used is not \nprecise  enough  to  cover  the  diversity  of  school  situations.  Norms-based  budgeting  is \nadministratively easier but has many practical problems. One of the most obvious examples is \nthe lack of relationship between institutional budgets and investments. Thus, the provision of \ncomputers to a school immediately implies additional operating budget to meet the increased \ncosts  of  electricity,  consumables,  servicing  and  maintenance,  and  internet  expenditure. \nHowever, the increased costs are not reflected in increased school operating budgets to cover \nthese  items.  As  a  result,  many  schools  have  difficulty maintaining  effective  usage  of  new \nfacilities such as computer rooms, laboratories, and workshops. Primary and secondary schools \nreport an increase in the number of institutions closing or limiting the use of computer rooms, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

The lack of precision in the budgeting mechanism means that expensive investments \nby the Government and development partners are often not utilized or only partially utilized, \nwhich in turn represents a waste of scarce resources. Budgeting mechanisms to cope with \ndiverse  school  situations  must  be  reviewed  and  the  mismatch  between  investments  and \nsupporting operating budgets addressed.  \n \n13.  Operating Budgets. In primary and secondary schools, (as well as nonformal education \nand technical and vocational education), operating budgets are now frequently reported to be \ninadequate to maintain effective school operations and activities. Focus group discussions and \nmeetings with principals and administrators of technical and vocational education institutions \nreveal significant shortfalls in budgets to sustain electricity, heating, cleaning, basic school \nmaintenance,  in-service  teacher  training,  learning  and  teaching  materials,  computers, \nlaboratories, and workshop operations. As a result, the quality of education provided by these \ninstitutions has declined and the environment in which education takes place has deteriorated. \nThe same picture emerges in preschools and primary and secondary schools. Available funding \nseems to be frequently allocated to the maintenance of remuneration for school staff and cuts \nare  made  in  budget lines  supporting  school operations, such  as  heating,  cleaning,  school \nmaintenance, computer rooms and school laboratories, and feeding. Most institutions are left \nwith three choices: (i) reduce activities, (ii) misreport enrollment data in order to get larger per \ncapita budget allocations, and (iii) pass on the budget gap to parents in the form of requests for \nincreased  parental  contributions.  The  school  survey  and  results  of  the  54  focus  group \ndiscussions suggest that in many schools and institutions all three of these options are utilized. \nThe provision of free services and social transfers is indirectly linked to the current problems in \nmaintaining operating budgets (i.e., funds used for social transfers and free services cannot be \nutilized for increasing annual operating budgets), so that financing gaps are passed on to \nparents and students in the form of user contributions. Thus \u201cfree\u201d services and social transfers \nare being financed indirectly, at least in part, by the same parents that the free services and \nsocial transfers are meant to support. The restoration of realistic operating budgets to support \nthe delivery of curriculum objectives and quality education is a high priority. \n \n14.  Inaccurate  Data.  Widespread  misreporting  of  enrollment  data  is  reported  and  in \nparticular  the  misreporting  of  boarders,  dropouts,  persistent  absenteeism,  and  outward \nmigrations.  The  falsification  or  misreporting  is  motivated  by  a  desire  to  achieve  adequate \nbudgets in order to continue providing basic school services and activities, which would not be \npossible  if  accurate  reporting  were  maintained.  The  reporting  of  dormitory  boarders  is  a \nparticular problem because of the current low per capita per day school feeding rate, which is \nset at only MNT868 per student per day. This is insufficient to provide three good meals a day \nfor boarders and many schools, particularly in rural and remote areas, openly admit that they \ncan only maintain adequate feeding programs for boarders if the feeding budgets are increased \nby misreporting data. In an informal school survey in a soum school in Arhangay aimag, 73 of \n75 boarders complained that they were always hungry and never felt full after eating. Because \nof weak institutional monitoring much of the misreporting goes unnoticed. The overall impact of \nthis is that budgeting and planning are increasingly based on unreliable data.   \n \n15.  Monitoring  and  Supervision.  Monitoring  and  supervision  is  not  adequate  in \npreschools, and primary and secondary schools. Because of the great distances involved in \nMongolia, monitoring and supervision are expensive activities that are more limited in times of \nfinancial constraint. As a result, misreporting of enrollments, boarders, dropouts, and transfers is \nlikely  to  go  unnoticed,  which  in  turn  makes  accurate  planning  and  budgeting  problematic. \nStrategies  need  to  be  developed  to  support  effective  monitoring  and  supervision  at  an \n ", "Appendix 2  31 \naffordable cost. Closely associated with this is the monitoring of school meals. Soum and bagh \nadministrations and municipal and aimag education departments do supervise the meals but the \noversight  seems  to  be  only  concentrated  on  quality,  hygiene,  and  taste.  Little  supervision \nfocuses on procurement arrangements, contracting, and purchasing so that many irregularities \ngo unobserved.  \n \n16.  Performance Evaluation. Closely associated with the lack of effective monitoring and \nsupervision is a lack of reliable performance evaluation mechanisms to accurately measure \nstudent and system performance, and the impact of the current financial crisis on system \noutputs. This is a cross-cutting issue that affects all education subsectors, including higher \neducation. Even in preschools, individual preschools are setting their own evaluation criteria and \nperformance measurement systems in the reported absence of national guidelines. In primary \nand secondary schools, teachers are consistently reported to award higher grades to students \nin order to avoid disciplinary action from school principals. Technical, vocational, and higher \neducation subsectors also report difficulties in standardizing the grading of students both on \nentry  and  graduation.  The  system  currently  has  no  access  to  international  comparative \nperformance testing, although the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study is \nexpected to be launched in Mongolia in the near future. The shift to student-centered learning \nand a skills-based curriculum will only be effective if a national skills-based assessment system \nis introduced. Teachers are said to \u201cteach to the test.\u201d If skills are not tested the tendency will \nalways be to revert to the fact- and memory-based education objectives and outputs. \n \n17.  Efficiency. Lack of operating efficiency in a wide variety of areas suggests that the \neducation system often represents a significant waste of scare resources. These range from the \npoor targeting of social transfers; the poor quality of school feeding programs where food is not \nconsumed, particularly in  richer  urban  areas; the  nonuse  or  only  partial  use  of  expensive \ninvestments in computers, school laboratories, and workshops; and poor budget allocation \ndecisions by schools.  \n \n18.  Targeting. Associated with the need to upgrade the efficiency of financial management \nis a need to improve targeting, monitoring, and supervision of social transfers. \n ", "  \nPROBLEM TREE ANALYSIS  3\n2\n   \nIncreasing poverty in Mongolia \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nEffects  Deaccrheiaesveedm eednut coaf ttihoen al  pDroecveeslosp omf ethnet   Increalaseb oinr  child  unIenmcrpeloaysmede nt  Dheecarletha saen din   MoDnegcorleiaans eg rino ss  ix 3\n \npoor  poor hindered  nutrition status  national product \n \nCore Problem  Decreased enrollment and retention of \npoor children in schools \nReduction in  Decreased school  Deteriorated  Decreased \nhousehold  assistance of the  conditions of  quality of \nspending on  state to the poor  schools  education \neducation\nReduction of \nReduction in quantity \nhousehold \nincome  and quality of social \nservices by the state \nCauses \nIncreased unemployment Increased inflation  Cuts in social sector spending\nSlowdown of Mongolian economy Reduction of government revenues \nReduction in \ndemand for minerals\nWorld economy \nslowdown\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "Appendix 4  33 \nCOMPLEMENTARITIES WITH OTHER ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK-FUNDED PROJECTS \n \n  Complementarities with the Education for the Poor\u2014\nProject Name  Financial Crisis Response Project (the Project) \nSocial Sectors Support  The SSSP contains the following policy measures related to the \nProgram (SSSP)  targeting of textbooks to secondary school students from poor \n  families: (i) the Government of Mongolia (the Government), \nthrough the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS), \nwill establish a working group to asses implementation viability of \nproxy means testing (PMT) for textbooks (first tranche policy \nmeasure); and (ii) the Government, through MECS, will approve \nPMT-based eligibility for the subsidies for secondary school \ntextbook subsidies (second tranche policy measure). The policy \nmeasures in the SSSP are designed to prepare the foundation \nfor implementation of the Project. While the SSSP will determine \neligibility for PMT, the Project is a sector intervention that will \nsupport the Government in (i) improving the efficiency and \neffectiveness of delivery of two education programs (meals at \npreschools and secondary textbook provision), which school \nsurveys and focus group discussions clearly indicate are \nperceived to be key for access and quality; (ii) building MECS \ncapacity in targeting mechanisms; (iii) monitoring and evaluating \ntargeting and program delivery; (iv) providing cash outlays to \nfinance the two programs during the financial crisis; and  \n(v) maintaining longer-term policy reform in the education sector. \nEnsuring careful planning of the targeting reforms will be \nsupported by the SSSP associated technical assistance (TA), \nwhich will provide 3 person-months of international consultant \nexpertise to help MECS with targeting. \nFood and Nutrition Social  The Project will introduce PMT in support of textbook provision \nWelfare Program and  for poor children in secondary schools.

The Project will provide block grants to selected schools and dormitories on a pilot basis \nto meet the operation and maintenance costs during the financial downturn. A block grant is \ndefined as a designated amount of funds provided for specific purposes. The Project has two \ntypes of block grants: (i) for primary schools and secondary schools, and (ii) for boarding \nschools (dormitories). In each case, the objective is to provide resources to maintain the access, \nretention, and quality of education services. In the case of schools, the block grants will ensure \nmaintenance  of  quality  by  making  available  essential  instructional  materials,  and  ensure \nminimum learning conditions by supporting provision of equipment, consumables, and basic \nmaintenance. They will also have the effect of reducing requests for parents\u2019 contributions, thus \nreducing a major barrier to continued enrollment. In the case of dormitories, the block grants will \nbe used to maintain minimum living standards and a healthy environment by allocating funds to \npurchase basic equipment and ensure basic maintenance costs. \n \nB.  Selection of Schools \n \n2.  Block grants will be administered on a pilot basis in the first year of the Project (school \nyear [SY] 2009/10) to 100 schools including boarding schools, and will be evaluated at midterm \nreview. A survey of the first 100 schools for the block grant will be conducted to help in \ndetermining what is adequate, affordable, and sustainable for the scaling up of the block grants. \nIf the pilot is deemed successful and after necessary revisions have been made, it will be scaled \nup to an additional 220 schools and boarding schools in SY2010/11. \n \n3.  Block grants will support two types of schools: (i) schools in soum and bagh areas \nserving a high proportion of children from poor families, and (ii) schools in relatively advantaged \nareas but serving poor communities and children (periurban districts in Ulaanbaatar). \n \n4.  The Project will recruit an international consultant who will, in broad consultation with the \nMinistry of Education, Culture and Science staff, education and culture departments, and key \nstakeholders, design a formula to allocate the total available block grant amount among schools \naccording to such issues as enrollment size, poverty incidence, current investments in facilities \nand equipment, school condition, and maintenance needs. \n \n5.  The following criteria will serve as guidelines for the selection of schools. Schools that \nmeet all or most of the criteria will be given priority. The school \n \n(i)  does not receive sufficient operation and maintenance budget under the current \nfunding formula (e.g., schools with low enrollment in remote, rural areas); \n(ii)  is in an aimag with a high poverty index (2008); \n(iii)  has a large number of boarders; and \n(iv)  has  invested  in  computer  laboratories,  science  laboratories,  and  workshops \n(currently largely unsupported by operating budgets). \n \n6.

The Project will recruit an international consultant (para. 4) for the delivery of the block \ngrants, who will (i) in consultation with the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, aimag \neducation and culture departments, and other key stakeholders, identify 100 schools based on \nthe criteria; (ii) determine reasonable item costs; (iii) prepare a detailed list of eligible items;  \n(iv)  revise  as  necessary  the  proposal  pro-forma;  (v)  prepare  the  procurement  guidelines;  \n(vi) prepare the monitoring guidelines; and (vii) prepare detailed implementation guidelines and \nimplementation schedules.  \n \n8.  Block grants will not exceed $10,000 per school and are generally expected to be used \nwithin 1 year. Funds will be released to school and dormitory accounts on a one-time basis; \nhowever, particularly disadvantaged schools and dormitories may be considered for further \nallocations the following year.  \n \n9.  Schools will be provided with a sample proposal pro-forma and school councils will \ndevelop proposals and complete the proposal pro-forma in order to access block grants.  \n \n10.  Decisions regarding the use of a block grant by the school and dormitory will be made by \na committee comprising (i) the principal of the school and/or dormitory; (ii) the chairperson of the \nschool council; (iii) a student representative; and (iv) a representative of the community, e.g., \nparent associations. The principal and the chairperson of the school council must sign the \nannual plan and annual report to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of block \ngrants. In addition, each school and dormitory will publicly announce, through a bulletin board \noutside the institution, the amount of funding received from the Project, the agreed purposes for \nwhich the block grant will be used, status of block grant use, and implementation of the financed \nactivities. Schools will be required to report regularly in a public forum to community members \non activities, progress, and financial status of the block grant-supported activities. \n \nD.  Monitoring of Block Grants \n \n11.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  (i)  block  grants  are  awarded,  distributed,  and  used  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  upon  criteria  and  guidelines  established  by  the  Project;  and  \n(ii) public accountability and transparency of the block grant award and use are maintained. To \nensure transparency and accountability, monitoring consultants will monitor utilization of the \nblock  grants  on  a  semiannual  basis  through  school  visits  and  interviews.  The  monitoring \nconsultants will make unannounced visits to randomly selected sample schools to audit school \neligibility, selection process, and block grant activities against the school proposal. The school \nprincipal will be responsible for effective utilization of the grant and for reporting its use through \na simplified statement.  \n \nE.  Proposed Eligible Items for Block Grant Support \n \n12.  The block grants will broadly support items aimed at improving (i) equity, (ii) minimum \nlearning conditions, and (iii) quality (teaching\u2013learning process and learning outcomes). \n \n13.  Examples of eligible items include the following: \n \n(i)  minimum learning conditions: (a) repairs of facilities that are dangerous to \nstudents, (b) basic water and sanitation facilities for schools, (c) electricity, and \n(d) heating; \n ", "Appendix 6  39 \n \n(ii)  quality: (a) maintenance of computers, internet connections, and consumable \nsupplies;  (b)  laboratory  and  workshop  supplies;  (c)  teaching  and  learning \nmaterials  (beyond  textbooks)  specified  within  the  curriculum;  and \n(d) supplementary materials (blackboards, whiteboards, chalk, markers); and \n \n(iii)  boarding  schools:  (a)  basic  equipment  (e.g.,  furniture,  kitchen  equipment, \nkitchen utensils, and cleaning equipment); (b) maintenance (e.g., electricity and \nheating costs, and minor repairs); (c) free-time supplies (e.g., gender-sensitive \ntoys, furniture, and equipment for play); and (d) boarding supplies (blankets, \ncarpets, linen, and towels). \n \n14.  The schools will follow procurement guidelines prepared by the project consultant.   \n \n15.  To raise awareness among schools regarding block grants, the Project will disseminate \ninformation through various channels (e.g., radio, government channels, village notice boards, \nand nongovernment organizations). \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  4\n0\n   \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Categories \nA\nMNT Million  $'000  p\np\ne\nForeign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  % of Total  n\nd\nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost  Exchange Currency Cost  Base Cost ix\n 7\nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Government of Mongolia (the Government) has adopted the Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy,a \nthe National Action Plan for 2008\u20132012,b and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which together constitute the \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy. The Government considers strengthening the education system as an integral part of its \n(i) economic growth strategy, which aims to promote stable, private sector-led growth; and (ii) social strategy, which aims to \nimprove access of the poor to stable income opportunities, and improve the quality and accessibility of social services. In \n2008, the Government launched a long-term National Development Strategy, consistent with achieving the MDGs, for the \nperiod to 2020. Mongolia\u2019s National Development Strategyc states that one of the key priorities of the Government is \nimproving the quality of and access to basic education and health services in order to support employment and income-\ngenerating activities and sustainable human development.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s education policy is driven by the Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP) 2006\u20132015d and the Education for \nAll strategic plan, both of which were prepared with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. The ESMP provides the \nprincipal planning and policy framework for the education sector. It identifies improving education quality, and maintaining and \nincreasing enrollment rates as part of the overall outcome to be attained by 2015.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2007\u20132009)e for Mongolia confirms the overall directions of the country strategy \nand program and its priority focus on poverty reduction and the MDGs. The education sector road map of the country \noperations business plan 2009\u20132013 (under preparation)f identifies the need to improve education sector performance as an \nimportant issue. Over the past decade, good progress has been made in the education sector, partly as a result of effective \nworking relationships between the Government, ADB, and the other key development partners. However, the progress \nachieved in expanding access to preschool and basic education, and the effective launch of the Ministry of Education, Culture \nand Science (MECS) program in shifting to a 12-year basic education system by reducing the school entry age to 6 years is \nlikely to be undermined by the current financial crisis. With one third of Mongolia\u2019s population living in poverty, unless the \nGovernment is able to execute an orderly adjustment to this external shock, the resulting social consequences will be severe, \npotentially undoing the gains of recent years and threatening the attainment of the MDGs. Maintaining access to and quality \nof education services during the financial crisis is a major challenge for the Government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (Millennium Development Goal 2) \n1.   Key Issues  \nFalling real wages, rapidly rising prices in basic foodstuffs, and rising unemployment have already had a severe impact on the \npoorest and their ability to provide adequate food and other necessities. Without assistance, households will be forced into \ndebt and may have to sell assets on which their livelihoods depend (herders are reported to be selling livestock to cope with \nthe crisis and even nonpoor families are taking out bank loans in order to survive). Householders who have taken out \nmortgage loans in foreign currency are affected by the impact of currency devaluation on monthly repayment rates. Cuts in \nschool operating budgets, currently at about 20%, have resulted in many basic services being reduced. The results of 54 \nfocus group discussions (FGDs) with teachers and parents in four rural aimags and in the city center and ger districts of \nUlaanbaatar, as part of project fact-finding, suggest that electricity, cleaning, and heating costs are being cut back. Some \nschools are predicting that current operating budget cuts will mean that they will not be able to heat schools for up to \n2 months during the winter. In-service teaching training investments have been cut back, which is a serious problem when all \nschools are in need of training to cope with the new curriculum and syllabi, and the unfamiliar demands of educating 6-year-\nolds. In a school survey covering 107 schools, 47% of schools openly confirm that they were attempting to claw back budget \nshortfalls by asking for increased parental contributions. Survey results, compared with a similar survey undertaken in 2008 \nsuggest that the real parental costs of sending children to school have increased over the past year. Reduced family \npurchasing power combined with the increased costs of sending children to school may lead to the withdrawal of children from \nschool and increased rates of dropout and absenteeism. FGDs also report that many families are now reduced to one hot \nmeal per day and this could result in malnutrition.g Common conditions of malnutrition and ill health reduce intelligence \nquotient by 5 points on average, and result in increased absenteeism. Global evidence indicates that school feeding has a \npositive impact on enrollment, attendance, retention, and improvement of gender balance. In-school meal programs have also \nbeen  shown  to  improve  cognitive  ability  and  educational  achievement,  particularly  when  supported  by  micronutrient \nfortification. A recent study in five countries affected by the global financial crisis notes that coping strategies employed by \nhouseholds include (i) eating less frequently and less nutritious foods, (ii) health seeking behavior has turned to self \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nmedication and putting off seeking help, (iii) children in some cases are being withdrawn from school, and (iv) child labor is \nincreasing. The potential increase in dropout rates and absenteeism in basic education is especially serious because when \npoor households withdraw their children from school, the risk is significant that the children will not return once the crisis is \nover, or that they will not be able to bridge the learning gaps resulting from gaps in attendance. The impact of the crisis on the \npoor and vulnerable groups will be long-lasting. Clearly, the emerging consensus is that the social sectors are of paramount \nimportance to protect, and that social safety net measures have profound impacts on households and greatly facilitate coping \nstrategies for the poor. \n \nRepeated household and school surveys and FGDs confirm that textbooks are considered to be the most important \ndeterminant of student performance but also represent the biggest single cost that most parents incur in sending their children \nto school. Focusing support on the provision of free textbooks to the poorest will protect and maintain access to education for \npoor and vulnerable groups. At least two thirds of the beneficiaries of free meals at preschools and secondary textbooks will \nbe children and students from poor families. The Project will provide capacity building to strengthen the efficiency and delivery \nof budgeting and financial management, as well as monitoring, supervision, and evaluation at MECS to anticipate and \nmitigate future risks associated with budget constraints. Specific monitoring of the inputs will ensure that the support is \ndirected at and benefits the poorest in society. Mongolia is among the 29% of all developing countries highly exposed to the \npoverty effects of the world financial crisis. This is due, in part, to overreliance on volatile mining revenues for government \nbudget and the large percentage of the existing poor.h In 2007/08, 35.2% of the population was classified as poor. But this \naverage figure conceals substantial regional differences in poverty with the western region in particular demonstrating poverty \nrates of more than 50%. Shifting demographics due to inward migration to urban areas have resulted in new vulnerable \npopulations in the periurban ger districts in Ulaanbaatar, Erdenet, and other cities. A high proportion of these migrant \npopulations has failed to register and thus cannot access social welfare programs. The crisis comes directly on the heels of \nthe 2008 massive spikes in inflation (particularly for food items) provoked by the global food crisis. Social analysis carried out \nin the preparation of the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project demonstrates that the poor were directly \naffected and immediately cut back on the quality and consumption of food, and reduce or eliminate expenditures for health, \neducation, transport, and energy. Evidence from the 1997 Asian financial crisis clearly demonstrates that social sectors, if not \nstrongly protected, are impacted and that the outcome can be long-term deficits in health and education, which are particularly \ndetrimental for the youngest.  \n \nThe World Bank analysis of the Living Standards Measurement Survey of 1998 and 2002i found that the negative impact of \npoverty on school dropout rates is significant at every level of schooling\u2014even at primary where completion rates are \nnormally close to universal\u2014and poverty has the largest effect on upper secondary dropouts. In the current financial crisis, \nFGDs in rural aimags report an increase in secondary school noncompletion for boys as they leave school early to apply for \njobs in mines before the jobs are taken by others. Poverty affects children\u2019s education outcomes directly (out-of-pocket and \nopportunity costs) and indirectly (family or parental background). Education quality (measured by 2006 and 2007 basic \neducation examination results conducted by the Education Evaluation Center) is significantly lower in rural areas. One of the \nmajor causes of high dropout rates, which is of specific significance to the poor, is the high and increasing parental cost of \nsending their children to school.  \n \nThe Mongolia Country Poverty Assessmentj highlights several important dynamics of poverty that will directly affect how the \nfinancial crisis will impact the poor. These include (i) rising inequality\u2014despite the previous overall strong growth in the \ncountry, this has not translated into increased poverty reduction;k (ii) worsening spatial inequalities\u2014although the decline in \nthe poverty rate is highest in Ulaanbaatar, this is accompanied by significant worsening within soum and countryside areas; \n(iii) reduced social safety nets and insufficient coping mechanisms in rural and urban areas; (iv) high reliance on social \nwelfare benefits, especially by the poor on the Child Money Program (CMP);l (v) difficulty in paying for school expenses and \nparticularly the costs of textbooks, school stationery, feeding, uniforms, transport, and contributions to school operating \nexpenses; (vi) inefficiency of the health insurance system for the poor;m and (vii) poor infrastructure and access to basic \nservices in remote, rural, and urban ger areas.n Price increases in basic household items and essential school stationery \nitems have been greater in rural than in urban areas, and life in rural areas is becoming more expensive. This, in combination \nwith a perceived lower quality of education and health services, triggers inward migration to aimag centers and urban areas, \nwhich in turn creates the new vulnerable periurban ger populations and creates double and triple shifting in many urban \nschools. Almost 30% of schools surveyed indicate that they did not receive the free textbook allocation for poor and \nvulnerable children. Most schools indicate that in any case the allocation for poor students was insufficient to meet needs and \nin addition was poorly administered. Improving the targeting of the free textbook allocation and the efficiency of the \nGovernment\u2019s social assistance program, the CMP, will have a significant impact on the affordability of education by the poor, \nparticularly in rural and urban ger areas. Starting from 2006, the CMP has provided MNT3,000 per month and MNT25,000 per \nquarter to all children aged 0\u201318 regardless of household income. Early findings of the ADB-funded Participatory Poverty \nAssessment and Monitoring Projecto indicate that these payments are an important source of income for very poor families, \nalthough the informal charges levied by many schools and the overall parental costs of education are too high for the poor, \neven with CMP support. Migration from rural to periurban areas has grown as migrants seek better education, health, other \nservices, and income-generating opportunities. This has caused overcrowding in urban schools. High migration rates can also \nbe associated with poor student performance in soum and bagh schools, and the indirect cost of schooling in relation to \n ", "Appendix 11  55 \nhousehold per capita expenditure increases significantly above grade 8. As a result, poorer families are underrepresented in \nupper secondary education in rural and urban areas. In effect, poverty is an important factor in determining whether a child is \nenrolled in school and also whether a child can progress to senior secondary and higher education. Yet, without unhampered \naccess to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the poverty line are restricted; \ngraduates of at least secondary education are significantly less likely to be poor. \n \n2.   Design Features  \nWhile the Project aims to provide immediate support to the feeding program for preschools, secondary textbook provision to \npoor students, and school maintenance costs, it also recognizes that current social transfers in Mongolia are typically not well \ntargeted on the poor. Take-up rates of social welfare by the nonpoor are higher than those of the poor. In fact, 70% of social \nwelfare beneficiaries are considered nonpoor.p The current free textbook program aims to provide 20% of the national \ntextbook requirement free of charge to poor students. Unfortunately the program is widely considered to be inefficiently \nmanaged with considerable access by the nonpoor. A recent World Bank study concluded that only 9% of the student \npopulation benefited from free textbooks and not all of these were poor. During the current financial crisis, the growing \nnumber of poor will find it increasingly difficult to maintain adequate food consumption and access to education. Similar issues \nof efficiency may also apply to the meal program at preschools. To address the issues of inefficient management and poor \ntargeting, both of which could undermine the impact of the project investments, the Project will (i) increase the percentage \nallocation of free textbooks from the current 20% to 40% to bring textbook support in line with the current national poverty \nthreshold indicator for 2008, which suggests that 35.2% of the population are poor; (ii) provide for intensive monitoring of \nmeals at preschools and secondary textbook programs until the proposed launch of proxy means testing as the basis for \nimproved social welfare targeting; (iii) conduct a textbook cost reduction study aimed at identifying strategies to significantly \nreduce the costs of textbooks to both government and families (this will be linked to the development of strategies to ensure \nfinancial affordability and sustainability for textbook provision in the future, and be closely linked to planned primary textbook \nactivities in the ADB-funded Education Sector Reform Projectq); (iv) conduct research studies to (a) develop strategies to \nimprove the quality, provision, and cost-effectiveness of meals at preschools; (b) evaluate ways to reduce the cost of school \nuniforms; (c) encourage greater community involvement in school management; (v) provide block grants to schools including \nboarding schools serving poor children to ensure minimum learning conditions in schools; and (vi) provide consulting services \nto MECS for capacity building in the critical management areas of planning, needs-based budgeting, financial management, \ndevelopment of an effective education management information system, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nProject beneficiaries will be students enrolled in preschools and secondary schools. The Project will benefit an estimated \n150,000 children aged 2\u20135 by providing a feeding program, thereby ensuring normal mental and physical development. In \naddition, about 100,000 students per year from low income families will benefit from receiving free textbooks in priority \nsubjects for at least 4 years because the Project will require an increase in textbook production standards to upgrade \ndurability to achieve a minimum 4-year book life, which will provide maximum cost amortization and reduced provision costs. \nAt least two thirds of targeted beneficiaries will be children from poor families. More than 100 schools will benefit from the pilot \nimplementation of the school block grants and an additional 200 schools may benefit in school year 2010/11 if the pilot proves \nsuccessful. Protecting access to education, enhancing quality through textbook support to the poorest, and providing nutrition \nand block grants to needy schools are all investments in the health and future productivity of the poor and vulnerable groups. \nThe most significant economic benefits will come from preventing malnutrition among vulnerable and at-risk children, and \nmaintaining current preschool and secondary school enrollment, while simultaneously preventing an increase in school \ndropout rates and increased absenteeism by providing essential learning materials such as textbooks, which will be targeted \nat poor students, and ensuring minimum learning conditions. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nKey Issues. For the targeted beneficiaries, social problems related to education are now both a rural and a periurban ger \nphenomenon. In rural areas children tend to be left out of upper secondary schooling because of a combination of lack of \naccess, poor quality education, and limited household affordability in the context of rising parental costs of schooling. Rural \nstudents in baghs and soums do not have equal access to upper secondary education because rural schools closed senior \nsecondary grades during the reorganization and rationalization reform in 1997. Provincial center schools have only limited \nspaces. Attrition rates are significantly higher among rural children, and education quality, measured by exam results, is \nsignificantly worse in rural schools. Poverty directly, through out-of-pocket and opportunity costs, and indirectly, through \nparental background, contributes to dropout rates. Rural students who tend to perform worse and drop out after the 8th grade \nare highly likely to be poor. High dropout rates are a concern because of their long-term implications for the intergenerational \ntransmission of poverty. Second, the implementing systems for teacher incentives, resource allocation, and public assistance \nto rural schools have shortcomings. An assessment of the outcomes from the rationalization and reorganization reform \nindicates that the reform effort seems to have perpetuated the widening gaps in education outcomes between urban (aimag \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \ncenter and capital city) and rural (soum and bagh) schools. Third, the tendency to migrate from rural areas to aimag centers \nand eventually to Ulaanbaatar has been very strong. According to findings of the survey Children on the Move: Rural-Urban \nMigration and Access to Education in Mongolia,r the major reasons for households to move are to find jobs (34.3%), to give \nchildren better education (31.2% overall but the most important reason among women), and to get closer to services and \ninformation (20.6%). During the last 10 years, 30% of migrants coming to Ulaanbaatar have been school-age children. As a \nresult of this additional burden, some urban schools have had to organize classes in three shifts with up to 60 pupils per class. \nSchool-age migrant children are more than three times as likely to be out of school than children of permanent residents. A \nthird of migrant children have dropped out of their schools mainly because of registration problems, discrimination at school, \nhigh costs in sending children to school, and family poverty. This situation not only contradicts the expectations of many \nmigrants, who came to the city to get their children a better education, but also negatively affects the quality of education in \nareas of both origin and destination. If the trend continues, it will create serious burdens on the capital city\u2019s schooling, \nhousing, infrastructure, environment, and social services. If the impacts of migration are not considered more systematically, \nnational goals for access to education will probably not be achieved.   \n \nThe current financial crisis has exacerbated all of these problems. Falling parental purchasing power, static or declining \nincomes, increased costs of access to schooling, and higher costs and lower education quality in rural areas have already had \nan impact on access to education, on the quality of education, and on child and family nutrition. Inward migration is likely to \nincrease during the crisis, which will create further stresses on urban schools already stretched to a maximum. Improved \naccess to a good education for rural students is a priority for equitable and sustainable development in Mongolia. Therefore, \nthe Project will assist the Government directly to improve access for rural and urban children, including (i) reducing costs for \nparents; (ii) providing incentives for attendance; (iii) improving targeting of education subsidies; (iv) increasing the efficiency of \nplanning and budgeting, financial management, data collection, and monitoring and evaluation; (v) providing school block \ngrants; and (vi) improving the availability and usage of key quality inputs into the education system. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. The  assessment  and  consultation  were  done  jointly  with  the  Government  to  ensure  participation  by  all  relevant \nstakeholders. All the executing agencies and other stakeholders were consulted. The Project was designed in a participatory \nprocess involving major national and provincial government and nongovernment stakeholders, school directors and teachers, \ncommunity leaders, and development partners through regular consultations, workshops, and presentations. During project \npreparation a survey of 107 schools (13% of Mongolian schools) in rural, remote, and urban ger locations was designed and \nconducted; 54 FGDs were organized in four aimags plus Ulaanbaatar with 570 parents and teachers of preschools, primary, \nand secondary schools. During implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in all of its activities.  \n \n2.

Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. According to the ADB-World Bank Mongolia country gender assessment (2005),s more girls than boys are \nenrolled in school in every aimag, including Ulaanbaatar city. This pattern emerged in the immediate posttransition period, \nalthough the gap has narrowed in recent years. Dropout rates for boys at secondary schools are high among poor families in \nurban areas, while in rural areas, children drop out even from primary school. The gender gap is particularly noticeable at \nhigher education: women constitute 80% of students who completed secondary education in a survey conducted by the \nUnited Nations Development Fund for Women-Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy. However, poverty \nincidence is higher for households headed by women than by men. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey/Living \nStandards Measurement Survey 2002/2003t indicates that the proportion of poor women (43.8%) is higher than the proportion \nof poor men (34.8%). Incidence of poverty of poor women is higher throughout the country: the proportion of poor women is \n41.6% compared with 27.8% for men. However, in the rural areas, the differences are less pronounced: the proportion of \nwomen (48.4%) who are poor marginally exceeds the proportion of poor men (42.8%). \n2.  Key Actions.

Reducing the costs of education will support continued attendance by both boys and girls. \nThe provision of feeding at preschools and block grants for school maintenance will be an incentive to attendance for both \nboys and girls.   \n ", "Appendix 11  57 \nIII.

Even so the reverse gender gap in enrollment and attendance rates at all levels of \neducation is creating imbalances in achievements with significant economic and social impacts. \nMales are participating less in education at a time when, globally, education and training are \nseen as key ingredients for educational development and global competitiveness. Access to \neducation is not limited to a women's issue; parent involvement in education is important and \nneeds to be encouraged and monitored.  \n \n2.  Government  provision  of  feeding  programs  at  preschools  has  contributed  to  equal \naccess  and  enrollment.  Further,  the  ability  of  mothers  to  send  their  younger  children  to \npreschool has not only an impact on their children\u2019s future success in primary school, but \npreschools also free up poor mothers, especially in single-parent households, to participate in \nthe labor market. As a result of the financial crisis, the Government is experiencing a budget \ngap in the provision of meals at preschools and may be forced to roll back its feeding program \nat preschools. Reduced feeding programs may adversely affect boys and poor women. The \ngender action plan is designed to decrease gender imbalances in preschool, primary, and \nsecondary  education.  It  aims  to  (i)  ensure  continued  provision  of  meals  at  preschools  to \npromote equality in enrollment; (ii) assist in reducing the dropout rates of boys and girls in \nsecondary schools  by targeting  textbooks  at poor  rural households;  (iii)  assist in  reducing \ndropout  of  boys  and  girls  in  primary  and  secondary  schools  by  providing  block  grants  to \nmaintain  education  quality;  and  (iv)  ensure  gender  sensitivity  in  targeting,  planning, \nmanagement, budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation in the education sector.   \n \n3.   Budget  and  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  action  plan  does  not  require  a \nseparate budget, as it is integrated into the Project. Implementation responsibility lies with the \nMinistry of Education, Culture and Science and the project implementation unit (PIU). Specific \nactivities,  such  as  ensuring  disaggregated  data  in  the  integrated  database  and  providing \ngender-sensitive monitoring of textbooks, meals at preschools, and block grants, are included in \nthe terms of reference for individual consultants. The PIU in the Ministry of Education, Culture \nand Science, with support from the gender specialist in the Mongolia Resident Mission of the \nAsian Development Bank, will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring implementation of \nthe plan. The implementation of the gender action plan is included as an assurance in project \ndocumentation. The gender action plan will be implemented from the fourth quarter of 2009 to \nearly 2012. \n \n4.   Monitoring. Monitoring and evaluation of the action plan will be incorporated into the \noverall  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  the  Project.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for \nestablishing and coordinating monitoring and evaluation. ADB staff with expertise in gender \nissues will participate in the midterm review. ADB\u2019s Mongolia Resident Mission gender specialist \nwill provide support to the gender action plan and participate in the review missions. \n \nTable A12: Gender Action Plan \nProject       \nComponent  Tasks  Indicators  Responsibility \nOutput 1:  Ensure baseline surveys consider  Baseline survey  MECS and PIU \nFinancing and  gender-specific questions  results are sex-\nstrengthening    disaggregated  \nmeal provision at  Ensure use of sex-disaggregated data   \npreschools  for preschool enrollment and monitoring  Education monitoring \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nProject       \nComponent  Tasks  Indicators  Responsibility \n  If targeting for meals at preschools in  data are sex-\nthe medium term is envisioned, include  disaggregated \ngender, poverty, and indigenous   \nconsiderations in targeting criteria  \nOutput 2: Targeted  Ensure that free textbooks for poor and  Monitoring reports  MECS and PIU \nprovision of  vulnerable families reach boys, girls,  are sex-  \ntextbooks for  and members of ethnic minorities  disaggregated \nsecondary school     \nstudents from poor  Ensure gender-disaggregated  Sex-disaggregation \nfamilies  monitoring data  of beneficiaries \nOutput 3:   Ensure that block grants for materials,  Monitoring reports for  MECS and PIU \nProvision of block  equipment, and furniture equally benefit  block grants include a \ngrants for schools  boys and girls  gender variable \nin need serving \npoor students \nOutput 4: Central  Develop MECS staff capacity to identify  Relevant MECS staff  MECS and PIU \nand local capacity  barriers to boys\u2019 participation in  are trained in   \nbuilding   education  identifying barriers to  Gender \n    boys\u2019 participation in  specialist at the \nPrepare inclusive education  education  ADB Mongolia \ndevelopment plans that incorporate an    Resident \nanalysis of gender issues and plans to  Education information  Mission \naddress them  management system \n  incorporates sex-\nIntroduce gender-sensitive budgeting  disaggregated \nand tracking mechanisms as part of  indicators \nperformance-based planning and   \nmonitoring of education programs  Monitoring and \n  evaluation system at \nEnsure that the Project considers and  MECS includes sex-\nidentifies appropriate partners, local and  disaggregated \ninternational, in conducting the technical  variables \ncapacity development and training   \nactivities   Representatives of \n  parent associations \nEnsure gender and ethnicity  participate in \ndisaggregated data for (i) the  developing proposals \nconsolidated education management  for block grants \ninformation system, and  \n(ii) performance and impact monitoring \n \nEnsure participation of parents in \nmonitoring of project components, e.g., \nblock grant administration.  \nProgram  Create gender sensitivity among all  Training on gender  MECS, PIU \nManagement  stakeholders  sensitivity among all \n  stakeholders has \nEnsure gender-disaggregated data,  been conducted \nanalysis, and reporting on all project   \nactivities and components   Project reports \ninclude sex-\ndisaggregated data \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MECS = Ministry of Education, Culture and Science; PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: ADB. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090828101802+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: mon 43127, mongolia education development projects, poor-financial crisis projects, mongolia financial crisis", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090921121858+08'00'", "Title": "Education for the Poor-Financial Crisis Response Project"}}
